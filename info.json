And Sheridan was left with the horrid task of telling Lord Burleton she had somehow misplaced his bride. As she gazed at the tall, confident man before her, her courage failed.

Those red socks-with Sophie's business card neatly tucked inside-are practically all that's found after runner William Harrington is killed near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, seemingly the victim of a brutal death by polar bear. The Alaska cops want to know why Harrington carried Sophie's card. With an unerring nose for a good story, she heads north. What Sophie doesn't realize is that on her journey from Chicago to Prudhoe Bay, danger follows in her wake.

It's for people who want to quit something--or someone!--and start a new phase of their lives.First to join is Phoebe Rylander. She recently ended her engagement to a man who doesn't know the meaning of \"faithful, \" and she's trying to get over him. Then there's Alix Turner. She and her husband, Jordan, want a baby, which means she \"has\" to quit smoking.

There was no kiss. Abby was wrong. She was wrong about him, wrong about them. Maybe she didn't have to go to college two thousand miles away, but she did. She had to forget about him. Abby threw herself off the grid, disappearing completely from the life she knew. After completing her undergraduate degree, she enrolled in seminary. All contact with her old life was severed and she never looked back, until she was forced to. When Abby puts idealism into practice, her congregation throws her out. If she can survive a year on her own, they'll take her back, and continue to pay off her student loans--but if she fails, Abby is on her own with enough debt to fund a small town.

Emma knew that going to the tattoo shop with her best friend, Allie, would result in getting badgered until she ended up with some sort of needle piercing her flesh in one way or another. What she didn\u2019t plan on was ending up face-first on the floor of the shop with a busted lip. Or doing it in front of the hottest guy she\u2019d seen since\u2026well, ever. Mortified, Emma never thought she\u2019d ever step foot back in Skin Deep again. But fate, with a little help from Emma\u2019s flighty best friend and a chance encounter with a fudge bar, steps in. Now Emma\u2019s torn between taking a chance on getting her heart broken by the enigmatic, gorgeous Lucas, and playing it safe with good ol\u2019 trusty B.O.B. Lucas lets Emma know that he gets what he wants, and what he wants is her. When Emma gives in and quits pushing him away, she\u2019s surprised at how quickly the walls around her heart crumble. She\u2019s even more surprised that her unconventional, zany family just endears her even more to him. But no one knows there\u2019s someone that wants her more, and they\u2019ll stop at nothing to get her.

How much of my human side will I have to give up, and how much of the sinister side of faerie will I have to embrace? To sit on a throne that has ruled through bloodshed and violence for centuries, I might have to become that which I dread the most. Enemies watch my every move. My cousin Cel strives to have me killed even now from his prison cell. But not all the assassination attempts are his. Some Unseelie nobles have waited centuries for my aunt Andais, Queen of Air and Darkness, to become weak enough that she might be toppled from her throne. Enemies unforeseen move against us-enemies who would murder the least among us. The threat will drive us to allow human police into faerie for the first time in our history. I need my allies now more than ever, especially since fate will lead me into the arm of Mistral, Master of Storms, the queen's new captain of her guard. Our passion will reawaken powers long forgotten among the warriors of the sidhe. Pain and pleasure await me-and danger, as well, for some at that court seek only death. I will find new joys with the butterfly-winged demi-fey. My guards and I will show all of faerie that violence and sex are as popular among the sidhe as they are among the lesser fey of our court. The Darkness will weep, and Frost will comfort him. The gentlest of my guards will find new strength and break my heart.
