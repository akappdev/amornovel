The thick, uneven tone of his voice warned her that he was drunk again. The thud of his footsteps, uneven and heavy, made it clear that he was coming to get her.</p><p>If he found her awake, he\u2019d make her do it again.</p><p>\u201cHide in the closet,\u201d a voice whispered from beneath her bed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lana\u2019s hands shook as she pulled the quilt up to her neck and held it there. She was ready for him. \u201cBe quiet. Don\u2019t say anything.\u201d A movement made her turn her head, and she saw the dim smear of Jimmy\u2019s small face in the darkness. His brown eyes looked like holes burned through a bedsheet, reminding her that she wasn\u2019t the only one who was scared. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Jimmy.\u201d</p><p>She jumped as the bedroom door flung open and hit the inside wall. Bits of plaster fell from the edges of an old hole made a little larger by the impact of the doorknob; it crackled as it pelted the floor.</p><p>Backlit by the hallway lights, her dad cast a wide, block-shaped shadow across Lana\u2019s bed. He stood there for a minute, wavering, taking another drink from the bottle he carried before he let it drop to the floor. As he came across the carpet the soles of his shoes scraped against the plush fibers.</p><p>Don\u2019t shake. Don\u2019t move. Don\u2019t touch him.</p><p>Lana felt his wide, damp palm press against her forehead, and pretended to stir rather than flinch. The hardest part was keeping her breathing slow and steady, as if she was really asleep, while she fought the other feelings. They crawled under her skin like bugs, itching to get out and do their work.</p><p>Touch him touch him touch him touch him tou\u2014</p><p>\u201cLanie. Baby.\u201d Whiskey-soaked breath puffed against her face. \u201cYou \u2019wake?\u201d</p><p>Lana mumbled something and turned over on her side, clutching the stuffed bear she slept with against her pounding heart. She could feel her dad swaying over her, watching her, deciding what he would do. It depended on how drunk he was. Some nights he\u2019d remember how it was before, when her mom was alive and they were a real family, and he\u2019d leave her alone. Other nights . . .</p><p>But that was her fault. She\u2019d been afraid; she\u2019d lost control. If she hadn\u2019t, he would never have found out.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night, baby.\u201d Damp lips pressed against her ear before his rough voice crooned, \u201cYou\u2019ll be a good girl and do it again for Daddy, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Bile inched up her throat. If he kissed her mouth, she would puke in his face. But he couldn\u2019t reach her mouth, not without losing his precarious balance and falling on top of her, so he straightened, shuffling back a step.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow night,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Lana waited and listened as her dad shuffled from the room and the door banged shut. She heard the faint sounds of keys being pulled out and the creak of another door as it opened and closed. She didn\u2019t open her eyes until she heard the very last sound, the bell, and then she eased out of her bed and tiptoed over to put her ear to the door. Only after several minutes of silence did she know it was safe.</p><p>Jimmy sat up from his hiding place as she went to the closet and took out the backpack hidden behind the boxes of shoes. Her hands shook too much to unbutton her pajama top, so she pulled it over her head, revealing the T-shirt she wore beneath it.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t run away,\u201d Jimmy said, careful to keep his voice low. \u201cHe\u2019ll call them. They\u2019ll find you. They\u2019ll make you come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She opened a bureau drawer and grabbed a handful of socks. They didn\u2019t know about what she could do; he would never tell them. \u201cI\u2019m not ever coming back.\u201d She\u2019d stolen a little money every week from the cash box kept in the kitchen, and while forty dollars and sixty-eight cents wouldn\u2019t take her far, it would have to be enough.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do it again. Not ever.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Jimmy\u2019s voice climbed a panicky octave. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave me behind. He\u2019ll know that I helped you.\u201d</p><p>Her dad had a terrible temper, but while her mom had been alive he\u2019d managed to keep it under control. He\u2019d even been like a father to Lana, in a distant, indifferent way. She knew the only reason her parents had adopted her was that they couldn\u2019t have kids of their own, and her mother had wanted a little girl to love. Then things had changed, and her mom had stopped sleeping and started reading the Bible all day, carrying it with her everywhere, ignoring Lana and her dad until that last terrible night.</p><p>The slashing knife. You hellspawn. The fiery pain punching into her back. You demon. Every word screamed.</p><p>Lana\u2019s dad had never been the same after the funeral. He wouldn\u2019t talk to the police or anyone. He locked himself in her mom\u2019s room and drank. Whenever he came out, it was only to get more whiskey. Lana tried to speak to him and he hit her, knocking her into a wall.</p><p>You did this. She was right about you.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gonna be really mad,\u201d Jimmy was saying.</p><p>\u201cCall your mom after I leave and tell her that my dad hit you,\u201d Lana told him as she shoved some underwear into her pack. \u201cShow her those bruises on your back you got from falling out of the tree. She\u2019ll believe you.\u201d</p><p>Jimmy\u2019s mother, who shared custody of him with his father, had already complained to her ex- husband about Lana\u2019s dad and how much he frightened Jimmy. The last time she\u2019d come by on an unannounced visit she\u2019d found Lana\u2019s dad sleeping on the floor in the hall with a mostly empty bottle of Jack Daniel\u2019s, and she\u2019d warned Jimmy\u2019s father that she would go back to court and have the judge give her full custody. Jimmy had heard everything.</p><p>\u201cBut what if he comes to get me before my mom gets here?\u201d Jimmy persisted. \u201cHe\u2019ll kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d Lana shouldered her backpack and went over to kneel by the bed. Before she could say a single word Jimmy had her in a stranglehold hug.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her hand carefully over his sore back. He\u2019d been a good friend to her. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, Jimmy. You like living with your mom better anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom would help you, Lana.\u201d He pulled back, running his sleeve under his nose and blinking fiercely. \u201cMaybe you could come and live with us. We could ask her. She likes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad would find out, and you know what he would do to her.\u201d Lana gently removed his clinging arms from around her neck, and looked into his tear-filled eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go now.\u201d She kissed his forehead. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. Just hide until your mom comes.\u201d</p><p>She left Jimmy sobbing soundlessly into the side of her bed, and slipped out of the bedroom. After listening once more, she crossed the hall and crept out to the stairwell. She could see the front door from there, and the new locks her dad had installed a month ago, which required a key to open from either side. Fortunately everyone in the house had a copy, and Jimmy had been able to slip his father\u2019s from his key ring and bring it to her.</p><p>Lana clutched it in her fist as she moved toward the stairs. In a few minutes she\u2019d be downstairs and out the door, and she\u2019d be free. No more sleepless nights, no more hiding from her dad, no more fear. No more Lana, either. She\u2019d already picked out her new name, thanks to an old movie and a map of North Carolina. She didn\u2019t know how exactly yet, but she was going to find her real parents and call them. When she told them what had happened to her, they\u2019d be sorry and come and get her right away. They had to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A low chuckle behind her made Lana freeze.</p><p>\u201cI knew you were faking it,\u201d her dad said against the back of her neck.</p><p>As Lana swung around, she saw Jimmy standing just behind her father. He was holding his baseball bat.</p> <p>\u201cYou let her go.\u201d</p><p>Her father turned, his fist rising, and then Jimmy swung the bat, knocking it into the side of his head with a solid thunk. Lana bit back a scream as her father reeled into the wall and slid down it to sit on the floor, his head sagging against one shoulder.</p><p>Jimmy lowered the bat and looked at her as tears streaked his face. \u201cNow you can get away. Go. Hurry.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>Five years hadn\u2019t altered much of Rowan Dietrich or New York City. The kid who had carried everything she owned in a backpack when she had left for Georgia still owned little more than the clothes on her back. She\u2019d found friends, people who were as damaged and screwed up as she was, but the two most important had really been searching for each other, and now they were together and complete. They would have gladly gone on being her surrogate family, but she\u2019d wanted more than that, more than they could ever give. Leaving them behind hurt, but Rowan knew she\u2019d done the right thing.</p> <p>If destiny did exist, she thought as she removed her helmet, being alone seemed to be hers.</p><p>November had iced the roads with slush and frozen puddles, and forced her to keep her speed minimal as she retreated to the alleys. A few hours earlier she might have smelled what passed as a festive fragrance here: roasted nuts hawked by sidewalk vendors too fat or too poor to care about standing out in the cold. After midnight, the vendors trudged home while the dampness of the river crept east. The unlovely, clammy fumes of the Hudson blended with the perennial sour reek of car exhaust, garbage, and decades of grime exuded by the streets. Not even Pittsburgh, one of the dirtiest cities Rowan had ever seen, stank like New York.</p><p>Something small with patchy fur and a long tail skittered across the road ahead of her. It might have been a very small, ratty-looking cat, or a very large, catty-looking rat.</p><p>This was a stupid idea.</p><p>Sometimes she\u2019d smelled as vile as the streets, back when she\u2019d been a homeless runaway. Living in the bowels of the greatest city on earth didn\u2019t include regular bathroom privileges or ample opportunities to keep up her personal hygiene. No matter how often she\u2019d washed, she\u2019d soaked up the acrid, sour odor of the city until she thought she\u2019d never be clean again. Sometimes it had been so bad she\u2019d wondered if every night the city lifted some giant invisible leg and pissed on her while she slept.</p><p>Really stupid.</p> <p>As for the sights, the Big Apple appeared exactly as she remembered it, a soulless gray and black labyrinth of concrete and steel, as cold in electric light as in the wells of shadow, as indifferent to her as she\u2019d be to an ant. As she hooked her helmet to the lock she\u2019d installed at the back of her seat, she wondered why the passing years hadn\u2019t shrunk the city into something smaller and less intimidating. Surely any minute she\u2019d start feeling at least a twinge of fond nostalgia for the place where she\u2019d spent the worst times of her young life.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t happening. She\u2019d come back home unwanted and alone, and the city still didn\u2019t care. Realizing nothing had changed didn\u2019t chill her; resentment boiled in her chest.</p><p>Screw the Apple.</p><p>Her life had been polluted long enough by rage and fear of the things that had happened to her in this place without her permission. She\u2019d come here to free herself of the past and finally face her fear. She would not be beaten into the pavement again by it.</p><p>Well? What\u2019s it going to be?</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been thinking about doing this when she\u2019d left the interstate. She\u2019d taken the exit thinking she\u2019d just drive to the river, stop there, and have a look at the city from one of the docks. She\u2019d reminded herself of all the excellent reasons why she had to stay on the Jersey side of the Hudson, and then she was driving through the Lincoln Tunnel and uptown into the theater district, her visor up, her eyes searching. For what, she didn\u2019t know. She\u2019d left nothing behind but her innocence and two graves.</p><p>Three, she corrected herself as some cold part of her brain did the math. The sisters are dead, and the old man is, too. There\u2019s no one left who knows who or where or what I am.</p><p>In a few hours the Upper West Side would be choked with people and traffic, but in the predawn hours Rowan saw only a few cabs and patrol cars on the road, and some delivery trucks parked with their flashers on as they were being unloaded. Seeing the crates of produce and flowers being stacked on the hand trucks and wheeled into the groceries and restaurants made her stomach twist. When she\u2019d been desperate, she\u2019d stolen food off the back of some delivery trucks; seeing all that unguarded bounty still made her feel hungry\u2014and ashamed.</p> <p>Quickly she rode past a couple of pricey restaurants she didn\u2019t recognize. The leather bomber jacket that had kept her warm during the long, icy ride now felt smothering.</p><p>Welcome home, Rowan. Here, have a little panic attack to go along with your sniveling. A garbage truck passed her, splashing her left leg with gray slush. And fuck you.</p><p>At the next traffic light she stopped, braced her boots against the road, unzipped, and stripped. As she tied the jacket by the sleeves around her waist, she saw that sweat had soaked the two shirts she wore beneath it. A faint blue glow showed around the edges of her sleeves, and the skin of her inner arms crawled. If anyone had touched her in that moment, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to control herself.</p><p>Something was wrong, and the cause wasn\u2019t her ugly memories of the city. She scanned the surrounding area until she spotted a small group of Latino kids tagging a building under construction across the street. Stylized letters spelled out Neva B Tha Same in jailhouse jumpsuit orange and radiation-warning yellow. Other, equally artistic graffiti riddled the bare cinderblock walls around them.</p><p>On her side of the road there was no graffiti. Not a single tag, gang sign, or rap sentiment anywhere on the brick walls between the barred windows and grate-covered doors, all of which belonged to some upscale place. White letters on the dark brown canopy over the main entrance spelled out a single name in elegant script: D\u2019Anges.</p><p>Angelic? For the angels? Rowan wasn\u2019t sure. Outside the terms used in gourmet cookbooks and magazines, her French sucked.</p><p>Red light turned to green, but she didn\u2019t ride on, and the sound of her engine finally drew the attention of the graffiti artists to her presence. The boys turned en masse to hoot, whistle, and call out sexual invitations while palming their crotches.</p><p>The ultimate thug accolade. Relaxing a little, Rowan studied them. She knew from experience that teenage boys were often the most dangerous predators walking the streets, but something told her this bunch were mostly gab and grab.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed \u2019mana.\u201d The oldest boy, resplendent in his oversize football jersey and carpenter jeans, sauntered over. \u201cI like your ride.\u201d</p><p>Rowan checked his hands, which were grimy and speckled across the knuckles with yellow back-spray, but otherwise empty. No knives, no guns, no bricks, no tricks. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuy melaza.\u201d His eyes ate up her bike before squinting at her. \u201cYou take me around the block?\u201d</p><p>So he could dump her ass and deliver her machine to his cousin\u2019s chop shop? \u201cAnother time, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCo\u00f1o.\u201d He glanced back to smirk at the encouraging catcalls from his friends, and then shuffled closer. \u201cSo what you waiting here for? You need directions or something, mami?\u201d</p><p>She noticed he bypassed ogling her tits to check out her ignition. So that\u2019s the plan. \u201cDo I look lost to you, hijo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMira.\u201d Beautiful white teeth flashed against his dark face. \u201cMaybe I take you somewhere, huh?\u201d</p><p>As he reached to snatch her keys, she caught his wrist and jerked him closer. He wasn\u2019t expecting that, but she needed his body to block her from his friends\u2019 view. The leather sleeves encasing her forearms rippled as she looked into his eyes and saw the tiny reflection of her own face blur and change.</p><p>Inside Rowan\u2019s belly, a burst of heat solidified and began to expand. At the same time a stream of images and words poured into her mind. Ruthlessly she searched through them until she found what she needed. \u201cYou\u2019re being a bad boy, Juanito.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u00a1Al\u00e1balo que vive!\u201d The boy\u2019s eyes flew wide, until she could see the whites all around the dark irises. \u201cRosamada? Es tu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed.\u201d She didn\u2019t know enough Spanish to command him in that language, but now that all he saw was the face of the girl he loved, he probably wouldn\u2019t notice. \u201cIt\u2019s too late for you to be out, \u2019Nito. Say good-bye to your friends and go home now.\u201d</p><p>Juanito nodded, tugging something from his neck and dropping it into her lap. \u201cFor you. You wear it for me, Rosa.\u201d</p><p>Rowan had to root between her thighs until she felt the metal links and retrieved the heavy chain. A gleaming, solid-silver crucifix hung from it. \u201cWhy are you giving me your ice?\u201d</p><p>He looked past her. \u201cEnero.\u201d Without another word, he turned and trotted back to his friends.</p><p>Once upon a time Rowan had been a Catholic, so the cross didn\u2019t give her the creeps. Seeing Juanito and his friends make the sign of the cross and kiss their thumb knuckles before they scattered did. She looked over her shoulder, but didn\u2019t see anyone or anything but the dark windows of the restaurant.</p><p>What the hell had spooked them?</p><p>Rowan grabbed her helmet and pulled it back on. Enough was enough. In another day or two she\u2019d reach Boston, where she\u2019d been promised a good job and a cheap apartment. She\u2019d never been there before, but she was ready to make a fresh start. If it didn\u2019t work out, she\u2019d hit the road again and move on. There was always another place, another job, another chance.</p><p>All she had to do first was break a promise. The one she\u2019d sworn she never would.</p><p>The threadbare, moth-eaten blanket of winter night, which covered little and protected nothing, had effectively emptied out the alleys. When temperatures dropped, the usual residents deserted their dismal crate and cardboard-box niches. Sleeping outside when the mercury sank below twenty was an automatic sentence of death by hypothermia, so like the rats and strays, the homeless retreated to the relative safety of the subway tunnels, abandoned cars and condemned buildings, where the cold couldn\u2019t kill them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Two minutes before she laid down her bike, Rowan felt better about her bizarre impulse to come home one last time. There was no one to see her, and nothing to get in her way. She\u2019d cruise through her old haunts on the way to the cemetery, then ride up through the Bronx and head north before the sun rose.</p><p>She rounded a corner and turned down the alley behind it when something hit her from behind. Her bike lurched forward, and she looked back, expecting to see a car that had crowded too close.</p><p>The street behind her stood empty.</p> <p>Rowan glanced down at her tank, which she\u2019d just filled up in Pittsburgh. If she\u2019d gotten some bad gas it would have acted up long before now. The bike wasn\u2019t at fault; she\u2019d felt the impact. Something had hit her.</p><p>Cold sweat popped out on the back of her neck as she accelerated, the thrum of the engine muted by the pounding in her ears.</p><p>He knows I\u2019m here, the terrified kid in her head whispered. The old man. He\u2019s coming after me.</p><p>Fear-blind as she was, Rowan never saw what blew out her front tire. One moment she was speeding through the shadows and the next she was clinging to the grips as the bike went into a wild skid. Dimly she heard something else blow as the bike tilted, and then she was sliding sideways, the world turning on its head and the front end of a car rushing at her face.</p><p>In the instant before the crash, Rowan remembered why she\u2019d promised herself that she would never come back to the city. She\u2019d always feared that if she ever returned to New York, she\u2019d die here.</p> <p>And now she would.</p><p>\u201cSo I do not salt the eggplant or the zucchini,\u201d Bernard said, \u201cor cook in separate pots. Chef, this is America, not Nice. Everything here, it is quick. No one could tell a difference.\u201d</p><p>Jean-Marc Dansant turned away from his sous-chef, mainly to keep from throttling him. \u201cI could tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fat woman no complain, or send it back. She no care.\u201d Bernard threw out his hands in his favorite gesture, a combination of frustration and helplessness. \u201cIt was fine. The best. . . .\u201d He paused as he groped for the correct English, but failed. \u201cThe best courgettes \u00e0 la ni\u00e7oise I make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturellement.\u201d He removed his white jacket and tossed it in the laundry bin. \u201cThe problem, Bernard, is that she ordered ratatouille.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJe m\u2019en fiche.\u201d His sous-chef stalked out the back door.</p> <p>A few moments later the sound of squealing brakes and crashing metal came from the alley.</p><p>Dansant didn\u2019t feel alarmed by the noise. No doubt his sous-chef had knocked over the garbage bins with his car again. Bernard in a temper was nothing if not predictable. After inspecting the immaculate kitchen for the last time, Dansant shut off the light switches and went out into the alley to survey the mess.</p><p>He expected the smell of garbage, and the sight of it spread from one side of the alley to the other. He did not expect to see a motorcycle lying on the ground in front of Bernard\u2019s Volvo, or his sous- chef standing over a tall, skinny boy whose leather garments appeared badly scuffed. Then the biker removed his helmet, and under a mop of disheveled dark curls was revealed the thin, furious face of a dark-eyed, pale young woman.</p><p>In profile she was all angular bone and creamy white skin; the stately line of her nose at odds with the decadent contours of her mouth and the stubborn set of her jaw.</p><p>\u201cBernard.\u201d He spoke sharply to cut off the sous-chef\u2019s stream of obscenities in their native language.</p><p>His voice drew the girl\u2019s attention for a moment, and he saw that her lashes were like her hair, black, thick and curly. They framed eyes that seemed too dark to be so bright. She stiffened as if bracing herself for more trouble, and then saw his face. Whatever she saw made her body change, and she shifted on her feet, moving as if she meant to come to him.</p><p>Dansant understood; the feelings rising inside him made nothing in that moment more important than going to her. \u201cDid you knock her down?\u201d he asked Bernard without looking at him.</p><p>\u201cNon. She crash into my car.\u201d He stabbed a finger at the motorcycle. \u201cLook at the bumper, the grille. They are ruin.\u201d He turned his finger on the girl. \u201cYou pay for this.\u201d</p> <p>Bernard had to repeat his demand for payment twice more before the girl heard him and turned to face him. \u201cThe hell I will. You shouldn\u2019t be parked out here in the dark. It\u2019s illegal and dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her speak made Dansant\u2019s situation worse. The girl\u2019s low voice had a faint rasp to it, and brushed against his ears like silk cord. Silk, yes, that would suit her more than her boyish leather. He imagined wrapping her in yards of scarlet and gold, weaving it around the length of her torso, coiling it along her long limbs, knotting it so that her hands were bound to his, and everywhere he touched her she would feel twice, on her body and against her slim fingers. . . .</p><p>Never had he thought such things about a woman, Dansant thought, appalled. Not even with those he planned to seduce.</p><p>How could she do this to him, this girl? She\u2019d barely glanced at him, and he was ready to grab her and drag her inside and lay her out on the closest flat surface.</p><p>He breathed in deeply, hoping the stench of the alley would clear his head, but smelled a familiar, coppery scent. At last he saw more than her eyes, her face. Her gloves were in shreds, and both of her knees showed, scratched and bloodied, through tears in her trousers.</p><p>Here she was hurt, in pain, and all he\u2019d thought of was having her for his pleasure. He was no better than the idiot berating her.</p><p>\u201cI work here,\u201d Bernard was telling her. \u201cI park here every night. Bah.\u201d He pulled out his wallet and offered her an insurance card. \u201cYou give me yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not responsible. Someone hit me from behind.\u201d The girl ignored the card, hobbled slowly to where the motorcycle lay beside the car and crouched down. She ran her hand over one misshapen tire, then the other. \u201cDamn it, they\u2019re both blown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss. Miss.\u201d When she didn\u2019t respond, Bernard stalked over to her. \u201cWe call the insurance; let them say who pay.\u201d</p><p>She bent over to look under the car. \u201cI don\u2019t have any.\u201d His sous-chef did the same. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d \u201cInsurance.\u201d She stood, bracing one hand against the hood of the Volvo to steady herself. \u201cI don\u2019t carry any on my bike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now I must pay for everything. Such convenience for you.\u201d Bernard straightened and took out his mobile. \u201cI call police now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d She gave Bernard her full attention. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to get the police involved. We can work this out between the two of us.\u201d</p><p>She tried to sound more amicable, but for the first time Dansant caught a glimpse of fear in her eyes, and moved quickly over to stand beside her.</p><p>\u201cI am French,\u201d Bernard informed her before Dansant could say a word. \u201cNo stupid. I know your game. You crash into my car on purpose, force me give you money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Bernard,\u201d Dansant told him. \u201cClearly it was an accident.\u201d And if the man didn\u2019t soon shut up, Dansant was almost certain he was going to beat him senseless.</p><p>His sous-chef folded his arms. \u201cShe is scumming me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScamming,\u201d she corrected. \u201cAnd no, I\u2019m not doing that. Look, this was an accident, that\u2019s all. Why don\u2019t we just call it even and walk away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ruin my car. You have no insurance. You are no walking away.\u201d Bernard began to dial.</p><p>\u201c\u00c9crase.\u201d Dansant took out his wallet, eyed the car, and removed a handful of hundreds, which he put in the sous-chef\u2019s soft hand. \u201cThis will pay for the damages, plus two weeks\u2019 pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChef.\u201d Bernard frowned at the money. \u201cI do not need my pay tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. You\u2019re fired. Adieu, Bernard.\u201d Dansant turned to the girl, who stared at him with visible disbelief. Over Bernard\u2019s sputtering, he said, \u201cYou are hurt, but I can help you. Come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, thanks.\u201d She seemed genuinely unconcerned about her injuries. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJean-Marc Dansant. I own this restaurant. Come, mademoiselle.\u201d He took her arm, and when she pulled back he gestured at her knees. \u201cLook, there, you are bleeding. I have a first-aid kit inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Rowan.\u201d She turned her head. \u201cMy bike\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt cannot be taken, not as it is now,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>Rowan stared at the hand on her arm and then into his eyes. \u201cWhy are you doing this? You don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>She is afraid\u2014of me?</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d He didn\u2019t have the words to tell her, not yet. Not when he didn\u2019t understand what was pulling him to her. Whatever it was, he could not let it vanish into the night. He released her as he tried to think of something to say. \u201cIt is the kindness of a stranger, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot something I usually depend on.\u201d Rowan looked down at herself and sighed. \u201cBut I do need to clean up.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his teeth as images of his hands undressing her and washing her filled his mind. \u201cThen come inside with me, please.\u201d He offered her his hand this time, and after a long, silent moment, she took it.</p><p>\u201cJamais dans ma vie,\u201d Bernard called after them as Dansant guided her through the kitchen door and into the restaurant. \u201cYou be sorry you fire me. I am best sous-chef in\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fortunately the heavy steel door cut off the rest of what he shouted.</p><p>\u201cWait, please.\u201d Dansant left her by the long prep table and retrieved the first-aid kit from the dry storage room. When he returned she had stripped off her jacket and the shreds of her gloves, and was washing her hands at the rinsing sink beside the industrial dishwasher. Under a black T-shirt she wore a long- sleeved white thermal shirt, the cuffs of which were stained red with blood.</p><p>For the first time he realized how very tall she was\u2014only an inch or two shorter than he was\u2014and how perfectly her long body would fit to his. He\u2019d never made love to a woman who matched him physically. Nor would he if he left her standing and bleeding in his kitchen while he indulged in such fantasies. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet me see,\u201d he said as he put the kit on the sideboard.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not too bad. My gloves took the worst of it.\u201d She showed him her grazed, reddened palms before looking down. \u201cMy knees are a mess, though.\u201d</p><p>Dansant pulled an empty crate over by the table. \u201cSit here.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t move. \u201cThanks, but I think I can do this by myself.\u201d</p><p>Dansant removed some gauze pads and a small bottle of peroxide from the kit. \u201cYou are still shaken, ma m\u00fbre.\u201d</p><p>She limped over to the crate and perched on it. \u201cSo are you usually this kind to strangers?\u201d Before he could answer, she added, \u201cI\u2019m not going to sue, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about.\u201d</p><p>That she thought of herself as a stranger to him was perplexing. From the moment he\u2019d seen her face, he\u2019d known her. Not who she was, or why she had come to him now, but everything that mattered between a man and a woman. All he had to do was be patient, and wait for her to give herself over to him. Then he would show her that they were meant to be together.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t she feel it?</p> <p>\u201cI do not worry about this.\u201d He knelt before her to inspect the damage to her knees. \u201cThere is debris in the wounds. From the ground.\u201d He would need scissors to cut away her trouser legs. \u201cI must remove it.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he put his hand on her leg, Rowan stiffened. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up. \u201cYou do not like to be touched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sometimes I like it fine.\u201d She stared at his mouth before lifting her eyes to his, and he saw a glimmer of heat and longing. \u201cIt\u2019s the stranger part I have trouble with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d More than he could ever tell her. \u201cPerhaps just for tonight, we should think we are friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends.\u201d She seemed amused by this, but leaned back on her elbows. \u201cAll right, Dansant. Do whatever you want.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 2</p><p>Rowan wasn\u2019t sure how she went from thinking her life was over while laying down her bike in a dark alley to sitting on a crate in a restaurant kitchen and watching the top of Jean- Marc Dansant\u2019s head. She had an excellent vantage point, however, as he knelt in front of her, one hand wrapped around her calf while he examined the ugly wounds on her knees.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t we do this when I\u2019m not torn up and bleeding?</p><p>His black hair, long enough to merit a ponytail, had begun to escape the band at the back of his neck, and strands of it fell around his face in poetic disarray. She spent a long time looking at his hair, concentrating on it as if it were the most important thing in the world. Only when her eyes began to burn did she remember to blink, and then she fell right back into staring.</p><p>After some time had passed, Rowan shook off her uncharacteristic fascination with his mop. As she did, she felt a peculiar disorientation, as if time had stopped while she\u2019d forgotten where she was, and what she was doing.</p><p>What\u2019s wrong with me?</p><p>Evidently she\u2019d hit her head harder than she\u2019d thought during the crash, and it had turned her into a semizombie. She knew what she should have been thinking of: what to do next, how to get out of this, this restaurant, this accident, this city\u2014this whole mess. Someone had hit her from behind. She\u2019d come close to smearing herself like a bug all over the grille of a Volvo. She\u2019d survived, only to strand herself in the last place on earth she wanted to be stranded.</p><p>Idiot that she was, she\u2019d also let Dansant\u2014a bona fide stranger\u2014pay for the damage she\u2019d caused, and then had followed him inside his restaurant. Now she was letting him touch her, take care of her, like they were best friends. Sitting there and doing nothing, like it was nothing. Like she couldn\u2019t think for herself anymore.</p> <p>But she was thinking now, just one thing, over and over.</p><p>God, he\u2019s so damn pretty.</p><p>It seemed Dansant had come into the world with all the luxury upgrades: golden, flawless skin, strong jaw, stunning mouth, perfect nose, sculpted cheekbones, heavenly blue eyes, smooth arched brows. Rowan had never thought much of handsome men\u2014too in love with their own reflections, most of them\u2014but Dansant seemed almost too beautiful to be human, much less a regular guy. She kept trying to find a flaw somewhere; something that would make him seem less celestial.</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem to care that she wasn\u2019t succeeding. Maybe it was those angel eyes of his, she thought as she breathed in.</p><p>His eyes were as morning-sky blue as his hair was midnight black, which was the only peculiarity. Men with Dansant\u2019s dark coloring usually came with all-matching accessories. From where she sat she could smell flowers, spices, and heat, but couldn\u2019t decide if it was coming from his hair, his body, or the restaurant\u2019s kitchen. Or all three. The floral fragrance seemed hauntingly familiar, too, although the exact name of it eluded her.</p><p>If that\u2019s what he\u2019s using as aftershave, he\u2019s been shopping in the wrong cologne department. That could also be why it didn\u2019t offend Rowan\u2019s nose like other guy cologne, although it seemed to be everywhere: on him, in the air, all around her\u2014even on her clothes.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t remember ever seeing this restaurant, even when she\u2019d lived in New York, but for the first time since crossing the river, she felt as if she\u2019d come home. In fact, she couldn\u2019t remember feeling as comfortable and protected as she did in this moment.</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d Fresh pain shot through her throbbing thigh, abruptly sending the alarming amount of happy bullshit she was thinking straight out of her head. \u201cFuck, that hurt.\u201d</p><p>He glanced up, something she was sure he hadn\u2019t done once since she\u2019d given him permission to have his way with her skinned knees.</p><p>Was that disapproval she saw? Probably; she had a mouth like a truck driver\u2019s. \u201cSorry about the language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVous \u00eates tout excus\u00e9. That one, it was deep.\u201d He showed her a nasty- looking, bloody splinter before pitching it into the trash can beside them and going back to work.</p><p>Jacqueminot. That was what she was smelling. It had seemed so familiar because the woman who had saved her life had grown it in her garden. It might explain why she felt so at ease with Dansant; the scent brought back memories of the only place she had ever considered her home.</p><p>\u201cDo you live near here?\u201d he asked as he dampened a square of gauze with some water from a brown bottle.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t\u201d\u2014she took in a sharp breath as he began cleaning the blood from her knee\u2014\u201clive in the city,\u201d she said as she exhaled. A burning, fizzing sensation spread over her abrasion, which began to bubble with pink foam. \u201cI guess that\u2019s not water,\u201d she said, gritting her teeth to hold back another Fuck-prefaced protest.</p><p>\u201cPeroxide, to kill germs.\u201d He showed her the label on the bottle. \u201cThe ground in the alley is filthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d And if he kept talking, soon she might not feel any pain.</p><p>Not only was Angel Eyes the most physically beautiful man she\u2019d ever met; he also had without a doubt the best voice she\u2019d ever heard: rich, deep, dark and sweet\u2014a double shot of espresso with a honey chaser. Hearing it made her bones melt. Part of it had to be the way he spoke English, with that low, liquid French accent spilling over every word; it felt like being kissed on the ears. She could close her eyes and listen to him read his grocery list, and probably get off by the time he reached the dry goods. . . .</p><p>Something here was seriously wrong. Twenty minutes ago she\u2019d almost smeared herself all over a Volvo and had come within a phone call of mixing it up with the cops. Was she scared? Was she rethinking her declaration of independence? Was she even figuring out where she was going to sleep tonight?</p><p>No. She was thinking about banging the gorgeous Good Samaritan.</p><p>Jesus Christ. She had to get the hell out of here.</p><p>\u201cHey, uh, you don\u2019t have to do this. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d When that didn\u2019t get a response, she tried, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty late. Isn\u2019t there someone waiting for you at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy partner sleeps until dawn.\u201d He turned away to look for something in the kit. \u201cWhy are you here so late, Rowan? Do you visit someone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she lied without hesitation, and pushed herself down from the crate. \u201cThanks for helping me out. If you\u2019ll give me your address, I\u2019ll send you the money as soon as\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u00c7a ne va pas, non?\u201d He caught her hips between his palms. \u201cYou cannot go.\u201d</p><p>That grab went over the line for her, and she clamped her hands over his, intending to shove him away. Shifting her weight caused another jolt of pain to radiate from her knee, forcing her to instead hold on to him.</p><p>\u201cBe still,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>It was the damnedest thing. Those two words chased off the pain and brought back that sense of safety and well-being, just as she\u2019d felt before when he was cleaning her up. It confused her; she was hurt and that always made her angry. But trying to push him off suddenly didn\u2019t make sense, either; it wasn\u2019t as if he was trying to grab her ass or anything. Why was she acting like such a bitch? \u201cIt\u2019s okay; I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour motorcycle,\u201d he reminded her as he stood up, sliding his fingers through hers as casually as if they were on a date. \u201cIt needs some repair, oui?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt needs a lot of repair.\u201d She thought about the contents of her wallet; making the trip from Savannah had left it pretty thin. What cash she had wouldn\u2019t replace the tires, much less fix the damage to the chassis or whatever the crash might have done to the engine. She used to have a street map of the city in her head, but she\u2019d replaced it with mental diagrams of Atlanta and Savannah and Albany. \u201cIs there a bus stop near here that I can walk to that will take me to the Port Authority?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you cannot push the bike there or put it on the bus.\u201d</p><p>This would be the second set of wheels she\u2019d abandoned in as many months, and she wouldn\u2019t have anything but her feet or public transportation to help her get around Boston. Still, she had no other option. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not taking it with me.\u201d She freed her hands from his, and stuffed them in her pockets to keep from reaching for him again. At the same time her head seemed to clear. \u201cIf you call in a complaint about the bike to the cops, they\u2019ll send someone to tow it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is something better to do,\u201d he assured her. \u201cYou can stay. Work for me. Until your bike is fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork here? At the restaurant?\u201d Rowan couldn\u2019t understand why he was offering her a job, until she remembered him paying off Bernard. He thinks I\u2019m going to stiff him. \u201cListen, I will get you your money back, Dansant. There\u2019s a job waiting there for me in Boston, and I start as soon as I get there.\u201d Honesty made her add, \u201cIt might take me a couple of months to earn enough to cover what you gave Bernard, but I\u2019m good for it. I promise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo? You are here now. I have a job for you.\u201d He spread his hands. \u201cYou stay, work, pay me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what kind of job are we talking here?\u201d She glanced at the industrial-size dishwasher in the far corner of the kitchen. \u201cYou want me to do dishes? A little clich\u00e9, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, a plongeur? Never.\u201d He began replacing the supplies in the first-aid kit. \u201cI think you would be very good as un tournant, a . . . kitchen helper?\u201d</p><p>She knew what a tournant was; little more than a glorified drudge who ran between stations to fetch and carry for the line cooks, and handled the dirty work no one else wanted to do, like cleaning out the grease traps and scraping plates. It was supposed to be like an internship, to give an aspiring chef a chance to see a professional kitchen staff in action, and learn how things worked on the line. But that didn\u2019t change the fact that tournants were minimum-wage gophers who spent hours up to their elbows in trash and shit.</p><p>Rowan might never have gone to culinary school, but she was better than that. \u201cThanks, but I\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is work, Rowan.\u201d He put his hands on her shoulders. \u201cYou have family here, or Boston? Friends? Someone to help you?\u201d</p><p>She would have lied to him again, but by the time she\u2019d completed the thought the \u201cno\u201d had already left her lips.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any friends?\u201d</p><p>She had friends, plenty of them, but the thought of asking them for help didn\u2019t appeal to her in the slightest. Matthias and Jessa were living on his farm in Tennessee, but at the moment she felt as if she\u2019d rather walk to Boston on foot than call Matt and ask him for money. She hadn\u2019t exactly faced up to Jessa or explained why she\u2019d deceived her, either, and she was in no hurry to have that conversation. Drew, the closest friend she had after Matt and Jessa, had moved on himself, all the way out to California.</p><p>No, she thought, dismissing the last shred of doubt. Her life was her own now; she had to deal with this mess herself.</p><p>\u201cRowan?\u201d he persisted.</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cThere\u2019s no one I can ask for help.\u201d</p><p>He slid his hands down her arms before letting go. \u201cExcept me.\u201d</p><p>If he kept smiling and touching her like that she was going to climb the wall or jump him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sweet of you to offer me a job, Dansant, but even if I took it I\u2019d still need a place to live.\u201d Seeing his blank look, she added, \u201cThis is Manhattan, my man. I\u2019m broke, and minimum wage won\u2019t cover the rent for closet space around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d His expression cleared. \u201cYou will live here.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help the laugh. \u201cUh, as comfortable as the floor looks, I think ceramic tile would be bad for my back. Or are you planning to let me use one of your storage rooms?\u201d He was staring at her again, and she brought her hand to her nose. \u201cIs there something on my face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No.\u201d Dansant shook his head a little. \u201cI am sorry. I do not mean live here in the restaurant.\u201d He gestured toward the ceiling. \u201cUpstairs, there are two flats. One is empty.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he didn\u2019t understand the concept of I\u2019m broke. \u201cAnd what does the landlord want for rent?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Her brows rose. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a free apartment, pal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is when I am the landlord.\u201d He smiled briefly. \u201cMy partner and I own the entire building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d She glanced up to keep from drooling over his teeth, which were of course as dazzling white and perfect as the rest of him. \u201cYou\u2019d let me stay there for free, when you could rent out the apartment to someone who could pay?\u201d The way he kept touching her, maybe he meant to handle rent another way. \u201cYou thinking of taking it out in trade?\u201d</p><p>He was staring at her face again. \u201cWhat is this trade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d She let her gaze drift down the length of him, pausing to study the excellent fit of his khakis to his strong thighs and lean hips before looking into his eyes again. \u201cYou give me an apartment; I give you what you want. Trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I want, Rowan?\u201d He didn\u2019t sound offended or angry; now there was something like pity in his eyes.</p><p>She\u2019d spent years in bars hustling pool tables and getting hit on by beer-soaked Romeos; she\u2019d heard every come-on in existence. She had few illusions about her looks. The only reason a guy hit on her was because he was plastered or desperate.</p><p>But Dansant wasn\u2019t drunk, and if he was hard up for a woman she\u2019d eat her helmet. As spectacular as his looks were, he was also kind and gentle, and had tended to her as if she were some stray kitten he\u2019d found in the alley. She had no right to think he wanted her to pay the rent on her back; he hadn\u2019t made one move on her. She looked at his hands again, and saw how immaculate and well shaped they were. The evocative scent of jacqueminot warmed her lungs, as if she was standing in some unseen garden. One where she could happily spend the rest of her days.</p><p>He\u2019d definitely been shopping in the wrong cologne department. . . . Isn\u2019t there someone waiting for you at home? So beautiful and clean and perfectly groomed, Dansant was, right down to his manicured fingernails. My partner sleeps to dawn.</p><p>Oh, hell. Suddenly it all made sense. He\u2019s gay.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I was wrong.\u201d She ducked her head. \u201cSorry.\u201d And she was, for herself and all her sisters in the world who would never have a chance with the man. \u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d Still a little heartbroken, she glanced up. \u201cI mean, giving me a job, letting me stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d said only one of the apartments was empty. \u201cDo you live in the other one?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe man who lives there is a mechanic. I think he will know how to repair your motorcycle.\u201d</p><p>A job, a place to live, and a neighbor who could fix her bike. That was a hell of a lot more than she had waiting for her in Boston.</p><p>\u201cWell, you may be crazy, Dansant, but I\u2019m not. All right.\u201d She grinned at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a new tenant tournant.\u201d</p><p>The special analysis lab in the Atlanta headquarters of GenHance, Inc., had been given many names since being built. Administration identified it as \u201cthe clean room.\u201d The few technicians cleared for limited, supervised access quietly referred to it as \u201cthe pressure cooker.\u201d</p><p>The janitorial staff, who were not permitted inside, called it \u201cArea 51.\u201d</p><p>In reality the room was an enormous, two-thousand-square-foot sealed, sterile space, with its own air lock, power grid, security system, and complex, multifiltered air supply. Until they submitted to a full-body scan, no one who was authorized access could enter the room. Each day security personnel performed similar, intensive scans on the surgical steel walls, floors, and equipment inside the lab.</p><p>Nothing was brought into the room that was not first thoroughly inspected.</p><p>The official explanation was that the stringent measures were to protect the delicate materials involved in ongoing genetic experiments. In reality the measures were taken to protect the reason behind those experiments, and to assure that no activity or conversation held inside the clean room was monitored or recorded.</p><p>Lately, GenHance chairman Jonah Genaro had been spending a great deal of time in the clean room, but he had no choice. A month ago he\u2019d discovered a traitor on his staff, one who had been passing along information on GenHance\u2019s most sensitive projects to the company\u2019s primary targets, the Kyndred. He was taking no more chances.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir,\u201d Dr. Elliot Kirchner told Genaro after he finished relating the details of his latest test trials, and handed off the file to his assistant, Nella Hoff. \u201cResults consistently show that neuroblockers will not mute or nullify the negative effects.\u201d</p><p>Genaro regarded the two scientists for a long moment. Kirchner, a tall, gray-haired man with the graceless build of a long-legged bird, looked like an ostrich beside his petite, slightly built assistant.</p><p>\u201cWhoever injects the transerum will experience significant, cascading cerebral destabilization,\u201d Kirchner continued. \u201cThe breakdown of behavioral inhibitors and impulse control will occur within twenty-four to forty-eight hours.\u201d</p><p>As they had all witnessed when Bradford Lawson, a GenHance executive wounded during a botched attempt to capture a particularly valuable Kyndred, had stolen and injected himself with the transerum. \u201cIs the damage reversible?\u201d</p><p>Kirchner shook his head. \u201cThe transerum doesn\u2019t damage the brain, sir. It alters it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPermanently,\u201d Hoff added, nodding enough to make the bell of auburn hair around her face bob.</p><p>As chairman of one of the largest and most profitable biotech research corporations in the world, Jonah Genaro was accustomed to success. Under his direction GenHance, Inc., was actively researching therapeutic treatments for dozens of genetic abnormalities and disorders. His company was also widely considered the global leader in ground-breaking genetic research procedures, medical applications, and other important developments in the biotech industry.</p><p>Genaro had spent a great deal of time and money to create and maintain that illusion, to ensure that no one learned of the real work going on behind GenHance\u2019s humanitarian facade: using Kyndred DNA to create a serum that would genetically enhance humans and turn them into living weapons. He would not accept that the work of the past eleven years\u2014indeed, of his entire existence\u2014had all been for nothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nella Hoff\u2019s delicate floral perfume didn\u2019t quite cover the odor of her sweat, and Genaro noted the woman\u2019s nervous hand movements and damp temples before he addressed the chief geneticist. \u201cWhat will it take to deal with this destabilization issue?\u201d</p><p>Kirchner frowned. \u201cWe\u2019ve explored every possible modification, sir, without success. As it is now, the transerum cannot be used on humans without serious consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnacceptable.\u201d Before the geneticist could reply, he added, \u201cLest you forget, there are hundreds of human beings in the world who have already been successfully enhanced. The Kyndred were genetically altered and given extraordinary abilities. They still lead normal lives. None of them has gone insane.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat we know of,\u201d Hoff broke in. As both men regarded her, the skin around her nose tightened, but she plowed on. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Genaro, but Dr. Kirchner is right. The transerum can\u2019t be fixed unless we re-create the original experiment. The process used to enhance them was lost along with the geneticists who created them. The records were destroyed. There are no living witnesses. Where we are now, we\u2019re dead in the water.\u201d</p><p>Genaro glanced at Kirchner, whose expression remained remote. \u201cThe Kyndred are alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re idiots,\u201d Nella insisted. \u201cMost of them probably still don\u2019t even realize that they were deliberately enhanced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Hoff is correct. I\u2019ve reviewed all of the transcripts from the interrogations of the Kyndred we\u2019ve captured alive,\u201d Kirchner admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that they were altered in utero or in early infancy. They have no real recollection of the experiments, only fragmented memories and nightmares from childhood. They can\u2019t provide any useful information.\u201d</p><p>Genaro wasn\u2019t interested in the childhood tragedies of the Kyndred. \u201cThen what is the next step, Dr. Kirchner?\u201d</p> <p>His geneticist began to speak, but once more Nella interrupted. \u201cI believe I\u2019ve discovered the solution, sir.\u201d She lowered her voice a notch. \u201cWhile Dr. Kirchner was testing the neuroblockers, I decided to take the initiative with another approach. I accessed the bioarchives, retrieved a Kyndred sample, and used it with an organic human specimen in the neurosequencer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Kirchner\u2019s face darkened. \u201cYou took a sample and wasted it on a cadaver brain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a recovered partial sample,\u201d Nella snapped back, ire sparkling in her pretty green eyes. \u201cWe never recovered a full cell spread from the female. It was useless to us.\u201d</p><p>Now Genaro cut off Kirchner\u2019s furious response. \u201cWhat were the results, Dr. Hoff?\u201d</p><p>She produced a confident smile. \u201cIntroducing the Kyndred cells to the cadaver brain stabilized the serum. I recorded the simulation. If I may show you, sir?\u201d When he inclined his head, Nella went to a terminal and pulled up a video file to play onscreen. \u201cThis is the neurosequencing of the specimen after being injected with the transerum. As you can see here\u201d\u2014she traced a bright yellow, branching light\u2014\u201cthe destabilization process is well advanced. At this point I introduced DNA recovered from the female\u2019s single tissue sample.\u201d The web of yellow light began to shrink and in a few seconds disappeared altogether. \u201cThe specimen stabilized completely after thirty minutes, at which time the female\u2019s DNA became dormant.\u201d</p><p>Genaro had her run the simulation a second time before he asked, \u201cDo you know why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a theory about this particular female, sir,\u201d the assistant said, all eagerness now. \u201cIt\u2019s related to her specific enhancement. She\u2019s the most powerful Kyndred we\u2019ve identified to date. Her ability physically transforms both matter and energy. That makes her what I like to think of as a dominant.\u201d</p><p>Kirchner made a disgusted sound. \u201cFirst you help yourself to the bioarchives, and now you think you can categorize them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you wasting time on testing conventional inhibitors, someone had to,\u201d Hoff replied before turning back to address Genaro. \u201cSir, I can provide you with a detailed analysis of my experiment. All indications are that a full cell spread from this female subject will control the destabilization process during the enhancement stage. This is the breakthrough we needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d Genaro studied her damp face, and wondered why such an attractive woman would choose research science as her success vehicle. Perhaps she hasn\u2019t. \u201cDr. Hoff, why did you not first obtain permission from Dr. Kirchner for this experiment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all due respect, sir, Dr. Kirchner is not interested in anyone\u2019s opinion but his own. I knew he would treat my theory with utter contempt, and refuse to allow me to run the simulation.\u201d She folded her arms. \u201cConducting the experiment without his knowledge was the only way.\u201d</p><p>Genaro nodded slowly. \u201cVery well. Make copies of the simulation, and I want to see a complete analysis of the experiment as soon as possible, including all pertinent notes and research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have it on your desk before the close of business today, sir.\u201d Without looking at Kirchner, Nella left the lab.</p><p>Genaro waited until the doors of the air lock resealed before he spoke to his geneticist. \u201cYour assistant is a very ambitious woman, Elliot. She wants your job, I suspect, so she can have complete access to the project materials.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think she\u2019s a spy?\u201d</p><p>Genaro shrugged. \u201cHas she offered you anything out of the ordinary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex, a month after I hired her. I thought I had dealt with it.\u201d Kirchner rubbed his forehead. \u201cI apologize, Mr. Genaro. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have her terminated.\u201d When Kirchner gave him a surprised look, he added, \u201cShe did solve the problem with the transerum. I think that in itself deserves some reward.\u201d</p><p>Kirchner frowned. \u201cWhat exactly did you have in mind, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce we recover the female Kyndred with the dominant DNA and use it to stabilize the transerum, we will need a fresh cadaver brain.\u201d Genaro eyed the simulation loop still playing on the screen. \u201cDr. Hoff\u2019s should serve adequately.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Taire took one last peek through the hole she\u2019d wiped in the ice- covered windowpane, and watched Dansant lead Rowan toward the stairwell by the back storage room. She relaxed the fingers she\u2019d knotted into tight fists, and rested her forehead against the glass. Her breath melted some of the thin frost, which slid down the window like the tears on her face.</p><p>Rowan was banged up from the accident, but not too badly. Taire had overheard everything else. She was taking the job Dansant had offered. She was staying.</p><p>It had worked.</p><p>Taire wiped her face and nose on her sleeve before she moved away, taking care to stay in the shadows. No one was on the streets now, and she was only three blocks from her place, but she wouldn\u2019t risk being seen. Not now, when she was so close to getting some real answers.</p><p>She\u2019s older, and she\u2019s on her own. She lifted her cold, curled fingers to her mouth and blew on them. She has the marks. She has to know something.</p><p>An hour ago Taire had been idly watching some kids tagging a building when Rowan had stopped her bike at the traffic light. The first thing she\u2019d spotted was the jacket tied around Rowan\u2019s waist, which in the freezing cold made no sense. Then one of the homeboys had gone over to sweet-talk her and then tried to grab her keys, and she\u2019d grabbed him back. When the edge of Rowan\u2019s sleeve slid down, and the edge of a black tattoo appeared, Taire had straightened.</p><p>Then something strange had happened.</p><p>Taire couldn\u2019t see Rowan\u2019s face, but she got a good look at the weird blue glow that had appeared under both of her sleeves. She\u2019d heard the tone of the boy\u2019s voice when he\u2019d called her some Spanish name. Cold as it was, Taire had also picked up the faintest scent of something tart and fruity and\u2014for want of a better word\u2014ticklish. Complex and alien, it was coming from Rowan.</p><p>She had breathed in deeply to break down the other girl\u2019s scent into its components. It smelled of grapefruit, oak, apple, pears, and mint. Then it came back to her, that New Year\u2019s Eve, when one young nanny had smuggled a bottle of champagne out of the wine cellar and up to the nursery to have her own private celebration. She\u2019d let little Taire take a sip from the clear, flat-bottomed cuv\u00e9e.</p><p>Rowan\u2014a biker chick\u2014smelled like that. Like Cristal.</p><p>Taire stopped across the street from her place and waited, turning her head to watch both sides of the street. The old hotel had been closed for several years, but the owner had hung onto the property until his death last year. Taire had found the place after reading about the owner\u2019s heirs suing each other over rights to and disposition of the property, as the land the hotel was built on was worth millions to the city\u2019s space-hungry real estate developers. Until the case was settled, and ownership established\u2014something that would take years, according to the paper\u2014the hotel would continue to stand, empty and useless, slowly decaying behind the graffiti-covered plywood nailed over its doors and windows.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as bad as some of the places Taire had slept. Once she\u2019d spent a weekend hiding in the corner of a warehouse in the meat-packing district, and the stink of old blood and raw meat had made her so sick she\u2019d puked up everything she\u2019d tried to eat. She knew better than to try sleeping in Central Park, but she\u2019d nodded off out of exhaustion one afternoon while sitting on a bench, only to wake up in the dark to find some old boozer groping through her jacket pockets for money.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t even been embarrassed over getting caught. Ain\u2019t you got nothing you can gimme, little girl?</p><p>Taire tried never to think about him, but sometimes she woke up smelling rotten breath laced with cheap wine, and seeing those bloodshot eyes bulging out as if they were going to pop out of his dirty, scabby old face.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t my fault. I was so tired.</p><p>Once she felt sure no one was watching, Taire closed her eyes. A moment later she darted across the street and climbed through the narrow gap in the boards, pausing only to secure them again before moving toward the old reception desk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The city had cut off water and power to the building long before Taire had moved in, so the interior was as frigid as the outside, and the boards and sheets of plywood blocked out any light from the street. She\u2019d bruised and scraped her hands and face falling over things more than once, but eventually she\u2019d memorized every inch of the place, until she could walk freely in the dark. Now she moved confidently through the labyrinth of dry- rotting furniture in the lobby, sure of every step, leaving puffs of her breath to hang in the frozen air.</p><p>To keep anyone from discovering her presence she\u2019d been careful to disturb nothing, leaving the cobweb-laced drapes drawn open and the front desk to collect nothing but layer upon layer of dust and dead insects. Rats had been a problem for a while, until she\u2019d found all the holes they\u2019d been using to get in and sealed them from inside, where the repairs couldn\u2019t be seen, using some drywall patches and filler that she\u2019d taken from a supply shed at a construction site.</p><p>Every time she stole something, guilt ate at her stomach. She wasn\u2019t a thief. But taking something that didn\u2019t belong to her was better than waking up to find some of her hair gone, gnawed off to line a rat\u2019s winter nest.</p> <p>Since the elevators no longer functioned, Taire used the service stairs to go up to her room on the fifth floor. Along the way she checked each step for new footprints or signs that someone else had moved in. An abandoned building was an open invitation to anyone left out in the cold, and the plywood boards were getting old now. This winter was going to be a bad one; she could almost smell in the wind the coming snowstorms. If squatters broke in she couldn\u2019t fight them; she\u2019d have to go and start looking for another place.</p><p>She thought of the faint blue glow that had appeared so briefly under Rowan\u2019s sleeves. Or maybe I won\u2019t have to.</p><p>The door to the room she used was locked like all the others, but she\u2019d filched one of the master keys from the manager\u2019s desk and used it to let herself in. It was the smallest on the fifth floor, and contained only a single twin bed covered with a cheap brown and green paisley spread, an empty metal television stand (the heirs had gotten to the TV sets before the case went to court), and a cramped shower and toilet. The inch of water left in the toilet had frozen.</p><p>Taire had chosen the room not because of the bed, which she never used, but for the closet tucked away behind the door. The small room adjoined another, larger suite, and the closet between them could be opened from both sides. If someone came in unexpectedly, she could take her things and slip out into the adjoining suite without opening the interior door or being seen.</p><p>She went into the bathroom and stepped into the tub, tugging down her jeans before she crouched down low and emptied her bladder into the drain. It had taken some practice before she\u2019d learned how to pee that way without splashing herself with her own urine. When she was finished she stepped out and poured down the drain a little bleach from the small jug she kept hidden behind the toilet. The smell from her urine abruptly disappeared.</p> <p>Out in the room, she shrugged off her jacket and hung it on the closet rail before looking down at the sagging black garbage bag that contained her spare clothes and shoes. She\u2019d spread the extra blanket she\u2019d found on the closet shelf over a mound of sheets and cushions she\u2019d removed from some rooms on another floor to make a bed for herself. Because the closet was only three feet wide she had to sleep curled up like a shrimp, with her feet braced against the inside of the door, but the cramped quarters made her feel safer than if she had been sleeping out in the open.</p><p>At first it was like curling up in a refrigerator, but it didn\u2019t take too long for her to warm up in the small space. The three blankets she\u2019d taken from other rooms trapped her body heat and kept her from freezing even on the coldest nights.</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother to remove her shoes as she settled in, covered up, and clenched her teeth to keep them from chattering. She began to warm up a little, but then her stomach started to growl. After a few minutes of listening to it, she took half a protein cereal bar from her jeans pocket. The foil wrapper crackled as she unfolded it and held the torn end to her nose. Although it was stale now, the white chocolate, toasted rice, and dried strawberries still made her mouth water. It was the last of her food stash, and she knew she should save it for tomorrow, but she was too cold and hungry now to sleep.</p><p>Her eyes stung as she nibbled at it, chewing every bite slowly to make it last as long as possible. This time a year ago she would have been asleep in her own bed, warm and cozy, her belly full. She\u2019d never realized how lucky she\u2019d been to have so much; she\u2019d taken it all for granted. Back then she\u2019d wasted enough food in one week to live on now for a month or two. Then it was gone, as if it had never been.</p><p>No more mistakes.</p><p>Taire reached under one of the pillows, took out the flashlight she\u2019d found in a utility closet downstairs, and turned it on as she removed a folded paper from the plastic bag holding her belongings. The paper, a glossy, professionally printed flyer, had the photo of a young girl in the center along with a detailed description. Anyone who had information leading to the recovery of Alana King, the flyer promised, would be given a reward of five hundred thousand dollars. All they had to do was call the toll- free number printed on the flyer.</p> <p>Taire crumpled the stiff paper in her fingers, and then smoothed it out and refolded it neatly before putting it back in her bag. She was convinced that Rowan could help her, but asking for that help would be almost as bad as making the call to the hotline for Alana King. She didn\u2019t know Rowan. The biker chick might not want to help her. She might even turn Taire over to the cops.</p><p>She was so close that it didn\u2019t seem fair that so many things could go wrong now. But they could, and just like the last time, one wrong decision would destroy everything. She had to be very careful, or she\u2019d blow her last chance to make things right with her father. If she didn\u2019t fix this, he would never let her come home again. He wouldn\u2019t send her to the room. This time he\u2019d make sure she never had a place to live or someone to love.</p><p>This time, he\u2019d kill her.</p><p>It\u2019ll be all right. Taire tucked a cold hand under her cheek and closed her eyes, imagining herself back in her old bed, surrounded by white eyelet lace curtains and clean linens, falling asleep while watching the snow fall outside. Rowan\u2019s here now, and she\u2019ll make everything fine again. She\u2019ll help me get back home.</p><p>\u201cSo when are you gonna come stop by the office in person for your messages, Sean?\u201d Rita the answering service operator asked. \u201c \u2019Cause I\u2019ll tell ya, we got a pool going on you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Sean Meriden spotted a parking spot opening up in front of a deli and slid his Mustang Cobra into it a few seconds before a suit in a silver Beemer could. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHundred ten bucks so far.\u201d She popped her gum. \u201cWhoever guesses right where you land on the Lost stud scale takes the pot.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at the Beemer\u2019s blaring horn as the driver gunned his high-priced engine and moved on. \u201cDo I want to know what the Lost stud scale is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLost, like the TV show, you know? We made a scale of one to ten for the guys on the show,\u201d Rita advised him. \u201cTen being Josh Holloway, and one being that googly-eyed guy who plays Ben.\u201d</p><p>The things women did to entertain themselves. \u201cWho\u2019s five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDesmond.\u201d She sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s not bad to look at, but that freaking Scottish accent and the way he\u2019s always like calling every guy \u2018brotha\u2019 gets on everyone\u2019s nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll let the pot build up a little more.\u201d Meriden climbed out, locked up, and fed the meter some coins while he enjoyed the gawkers. His red and white sports car might have been an antique, but it still drew the envious eye of every middle-aged man on the street. Women, on the other hand, paid more attention to Meriden. \u201cAny other calls come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouple.\u201d Paper shuffled on the other end of the line. \u201cMr. Dansant called just before midnight. Said to tell you that he moved someone into the other apartment. Didn\u2019t leave a phone number or ask for a call back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Meriden\u2019s smile faded. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last call came in about an hour before the day shift started. This guy said he was Gerald King of King Properties in Manhattan\u201d\u2014she snickered\u2014\u201cand that he needed to talk to you about doing a job for him. Left the number for his private line; I texted it to you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to think about the name; in Manhattan it was as well known as Donald Trump\u2019s. \u201cHe\u2019s not Gerald King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I told my supervisor when I picked up your overnight messages. She said maybe it was an alias for some other important guy who needs you.\u201d Rita chuckled. \u201cYou get the weirdest messages sometimes, Sean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoes with the job, sweetheart.\u201d He looked down the block until he located a phone booth. \u201cI\u2019ll check in with you around noon. Page me on the mobile if you get in something urgent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got twenty bucks on nine,\u201d Rita confided. \u201cYou gotta be a Matthew Fox. Big guy, scruffy, tattoos, beat all to hell, but a born hero. I could tell first time I talked to you.\u201d She disconnected before he could reply.</p><p>Meriden looked down at the inside of his right forearm. The tat in the center of his arm, a taijitu formed from the body of a snakelike dragon, had been rendered in scarlet ink that some people mistook at first glance for blood or a bad burn.</p><p>A born hero. If only Rita knew.</p><p>Meriden pulled up the text with King\u2019s number as he made his way to the phone booth. He never called clients from his mobile; that would give them the ability to call him at any hour or even track his whereabouts. His answering service covered calls to the number on his business cards, and any callbacks he had to make he did from a public phone.</p><p>He dialed the number from the text and waited for an answer.</p><p>The line connected on the third ring to a soft, dry male voice. \u201cHello.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is Sean Meriden. Gerald King left this number with my service, asked me to call about a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I made that call, Mr. Meriden. I presume you know who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGerald King died five years ago,\u201d Sean pointed out. \u201cIt was in all the papers. He your dad, or is this your idea of a clever alias?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere was an attempt made on my life five years ago,\u201d King said. \u201cTo prevent another, I have since allowed the general public to believe the first was successful.\u201d</p><p>King had been a complete recluse before he\u2019d died\u2014or had faked his death\u2014so his story was almost plausible. \u201cAre the police involved in your charade, or this job you want done?\u201d Meriden avoided butting heads with the NYPD whenever possible.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I prefer working with independent contractors. Excuse me for a moment.\u201d He continued speaking for a minute, but he must have covered the receiver, because Meriden couldn\u2019t make out more than the muffled sound of his voice. Then he said, \u201cI would like to hire you to find my daughter Alana, Mr. Meriden. I haven\u2019t seen her since she ran away from home, but according to the latest information I\u2019ve been given, she was seen in Manhattan yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Meriden felt oddly relieved. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. King, but I don\u2019t work missing persons cases. I\u2019m strictly bond jumpers and parole violators.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you find Alana and bring her home, I will pay you five hundred thousand dollars,\u201d King said as if he hadn\u2019t heard him. \u201cIn cash, if you prefer.\u201d</p> <p>He rubbed his forehead. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you pay me in gold coins, sir. My answer is still the same. I don\u2019t do runaways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I can persuade you to change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Meriden checked his watch; he had only seven hours left before he\u2019d have to call it a day. \u201cI believe we\u2019re done, Mr. King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d the old man said. \u201cWould you turn around for a moment, please?\u201d</p><p>Surprised by the request, he looked over his shoulder, and then turned. A heavyset man in a parka stood a few feet behind him. He was making short work of a pastrami sandwich half wrapped in greasy deli paper. When Meriden met his gaze, he scowled.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna be all day, pal?\u201d the fat man asked. \u201cI\u2019m freezing my ass off here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWatch,\u201d he heard King say over the line.</p><p>Meriden heard a hiss, and the man waiting to use the phone flinched and clapped a hand to the back of his head. His eyes widened as his hand, now wet with blood, slid away. The half-eaten sandwich hit the icy sidewalk a moment before the fat man\u2019s knees did, and then disappeared under the heavy body as the man toppled sideways and didn\u2019t move again.</p><p>As a passing woman stopped and screamed, Meriden saw the neat bullet hole at the base of the man\u2019s skull.</p><p>\u201cI can arrange the same thing to happen to you,\u201d King said softly. \u201cAt any time, in any place. As with that unfortunate gentleman on the sidewalk, there would be no warning at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He heard sirens approaching. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I want you to find Alana\u2014\u201d</p><p>As flashing lights appeared at the end of the next block, Meriden hung up the phone and wove his way through the gathering crowd around the body until he broke free of bodies. He pulled his car out of the parking space a few moments before the patrol cars arrived, and used the momentary traffic disruption to make a U-turn and drive away from the murder scene.</p><p>He watched his rearview to see if he was being followed while taking several unnecessary turns. Once he felt safe, he went directly to the garage. He left the Mustang parked in the bay, let himself out onto the roof, and stood watching the street for an hour.</p> <p>Gerald King was crazy, of that he was convinced. But if he went to the cops with this story, they\u2019d lock him up as a suspect or send him over to Bellevue. The last thing he needed was to spend a night in a holding cell or on a psych ward. He could hear the sound of the phone in the garage office below ringing, and his gut told him it was King.</p><p>Meriden climbed down the back fire escape stairwell and went on foot to D\u2019Anges, where he used his key to get inside and head up to his apartment. Fortunately he kept very little in the way of personal possessions, so it would take him only a few minutes to pack up. Then he saw the stack of money and note left on his kitchen table.</p><p>Dansant had left the note, which Meriden read then swore. The bike in the alley belonged to Dansant\u2019s new girlfriend, and he wanted Meriden to fix it. His fucking lordship had taken on another damsel in distress. Well, this time he\u2019d have to walk away from his new charity case. They had to get out of the city now, before King tracked them down.</p><p>Meriden was just closing his suitcase when the phone rang. No one had the number here, not even the girls at the answering service. The phone, like the apartment and the restaurant, belonged to Dansant. He considered tossing it through the window before he picked up the receiver and held it to his ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m disappointed in you, Mr. Meriden,\u201d King\u2019s dry voice said. \u201cPerhaps one demonstration was not adequate. Shall I arrange another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll kill me whenever you like, King,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether I take the job or not. So have your shooter do me now, because I\u2019ll burn in hell before I work for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn interesting response\u2014not at all what I\u2019d expected. I myself don\u2019t believe in hell.\u201d He paused. \u201cIt seems you have a new neighbor. I think you\u2019ll find the surveillance photos of her with your landlord to be most interesting. An envelope should be delivered to you within the next minute.\u201d</p><p>Meriden dropped the phone and went to the door, yanking it open. A kid wearing white ear buds and holding a plain brown envelope stood stooped over, and looked up in surprise.</p><p>\u201cHi. I\u2019m supposed to stick this under the door.\u201d He handed the envelope to Meriden, who grabbed the front of his ratty T-shirt. \u201cWhoa.\u201d He held up his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is. Some guy down the street paid me fifty bucks to deliver it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Meriden released him, shoved a five into the kid\u2019s hand, and shut the door. He opened the envelope and took out a short stack of five-by-seven photos and a file folder. The pictures showed a sequential series of shots of a tall dark man leading a tall pale girl into the kitchen and treating her scraped knees. The condition of her clothes looked as if she\u2019d slid across dirty concrete. He shuffled through the photos, studying them. Whoever the girl was, Dansant was definitely interested in her. One of the pictures showed him kneeling and looking up at her as if she were an angel.</p><p>Meriden went back and picked up the phone. \u201cYou get your rocks off peeping through windows, old man?\u201d</p><p>King didn\u2019t respond to the insult. \u201cAccording to the sous-chef your landlord fired last night, her name is Rowan Dietrich. It seems Mr. Dansant paid for the damages she caused before he tended to her injuries and let her into the apartment across from yours. A great kindness on his part.\u201d</p><p>The stupid bastard. \u201cNeither of them have anything to do with me, King. I just live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you have no history with Ms. Dietrich, but you and Jean-Marc Dansant are quite another matter.\u201d King made a thoughtful sound. \u201cThe two of you met in Paris and traveled all over Europe together before coming to the States. He helped you finance your garage, while you supervised renovations for his restaurant. I don\u2019t know how you were able to arrange his U.S. citizenship, but it was granted in a third of the time it usually takes.\u201d</p><p>He thought they were friends. Meriden began to laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is funny?\u201d For the first time the old man sounded angry.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and shoot Dansant,\u201d Meriden told him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be doing me a personal favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Ms. Dietrich?\u201d</p><p>He looked at the image of the battered girl. He had no interest in Dansant\u2019s strays, but something about her eyes made his gut knot. \u201cI don\u2019t know her. She\u2019s his problem, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the words of a born hero, Mr. Meriden,\u201d King chided. \u201cRita Gonzalez would be so disappointed.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been monitoring the mobile, somehow. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>The old man chuckled. \u201cGiven the charm of her voice, I was surprised to discover that Rita is a rather plain, plump woman of multiracial background. Too young to be a single mother of three, of course, but her kind always seems to breed indiscriminately. She walks fifteen blocks to work each day to save on subway fares. Her mother is already raising four grandchildren in a one-room flat, so I don\u2019t imagine three more will be welcome.\u201d</p><p>The information on Rita made it clear that King had been investigating him for some time. \u201cYou\u2019re bluffing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just received the background information on Ms. Dietrich.\u201d King drank something. \u201cIt seems she was recently involved in some very unpleasant business in Atlanta. She\u2019s wanted on multiple assault charges, vandalism, and various computer crimes. One of the corporations she defrauded is offering a sizable reward for her apprehension and return for prosecution.\u201d</p><p>Meriden said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI can arrange to have both Rita and Ms. Dietrich picked up today,\u201d the old man continued. \u201cSome of my employees are former convicts, you understand, and prefer to indulge some of their personal vices before they carry out their specific orders\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might.\u201d King\u2019s voice turned crisp. \u201cThe file in the envelope contains all the information you need to locate my daughter. Once you have her, you will bring her to me directly.\u201d He gave Meriden the address of one of the last privately owned mansions in Manhattan. \u201cOne last thing I should mention. Your movements and your communications will be under constant surveillance. Any attempt on your part to involve the authorities in any capacity will result in the immediate execution of someone you know, starting with Ms. Gonzalez.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Meriden opened the file and saw a stack of neatly typed pages, along with the photo of a young blond girl about nine years old. The kid was smiling, but her dark blue eyes looked frightened. \u201cI suppose now you\u2019ll give me some sort of impossible deadline to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d the old man said. \u201cI understand these sorts of investigations do take some time. I will give you three weeks to locate my daughter and bring her home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy three?\u201d Meriden asked. \u201cWhy not one, or five, or twelve?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I only have three weeks to live, Mr. Meriden,\u201d King said calmly. \u201cAnd, unless you find Alana, so do you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>The town of Halagan, California, didn\u2019t appear on most maps, and was barely large enough to rate a Welcome sign. The only paved road was Main Street, which curled through Halagan\u2019s official business district, a cluster of old wood-sided buildings, one or two that dated back to the Gold Rush days, when miners came down out of the hills to buy flour, salt pork, and, if they\u2019d panned enough that month, an hour with one of the tired whores at one of the town\u2019s five taverns.</p><p>A few weeks ago Andrew Riordan had stopped here for gas, caught a glimpse of a for-rent sign in the window of a boardinghouse, and decided it was as good a place as any to hole up in.</p><p>His landlady, an older woman who bred horses on a ranch a few miles outside of town, had not asked for his phony references or much in the way of a deposit.</p> <p>\u201cRent\u2019s due on the first of the month, utilities included,\u201d she told him briskly. \u201cYou pay for your phone calls per week. No kids or pets, no loud music, no cooking, and if you have a girlfriend by, she needs to leave before breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d He handed over his cash deposit. \u201cWho else lives in the house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides my good-for-nothing nephew?\u201d Her mouth twisted. \u201cA geologist doing some survey mapping up in the hills, one of the elementary school teachers in the middle of a nasty divorce, and Mr. Cantwell, who is collecting government disability while he tries to finish his first novel.\u201d</p><p>Drew winced. \u201cWhat\u2019s his disability?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe he has a terminal case of lazy-ass, don\u2019t-want-to-work syndrome.\u201d She tucked his money into a bank deposit envelope and met his gaze. \u201cMy brother-in-law is a county sheriff, and he\u2019s going to run your name, your driver\u2019s license number, and your tags. If he shouldn\u2019t, tell me now, and I\u2019ll return your deposit and you can keep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m clean.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d She handed him a business card. \u201cAny problems, you can reach me at either number anytime. Just be warned, you call after midnight, the place had better be burning down around you.\u201d</p><p>Drew chuckled and shook her hand.</p><p>The room he\u2019d rented had several bonuses: It was clean, comfortably furnished without being crowded or fussy, and the windows gave him an excellent view of both sides of Main Street. The tiny bathroom offered only a shower, but the water was hot, plentiful, and had the crystal-clear, faintly mineral taste of the mountain reservoir from where it originated.</p><p>Drew didn\u2019t unpack for the first week as he looked around and made himself known to the townspeople. A few eyed the new beard he\u2019d grown, and one of the waitresses at the local diner claimed he looked just like that red-haired actor during his NYPD Blue days, but other than that he passed inspection.</p><p>His cover story was as new as his beard; he was David White, a native of Los Angeles and graduate student who was spending his winter holidays on the road to see a little of the state while he figured out his thesis. It was just specific enough to explain his joblessness and the temporary nature of his residence, and vague enough to keep anyone from running more than a cursory background check. Even if someone did, Drew\u2019s hacking abilities combined with a little help from his friends had insured that every detail would hold up. David White was registered as a graduate student at his college, had last resided in a small apartment off campus, and had inherited a small but tidy sum of money from a deceased uncle that was financing his mini-sabbatical. His taxes were paid, his student loans were up-to-date, and even his car was registered to the nonexistent David White.</p><p>He had bought his phone in L.A. from a store that specialized in the latest preservation of privacy gear, and while it looked like an ordinary cordless, it encrypted its own signal and could detect a trace within five seconds of activation. His computer, salvaged from the house in Savannah that had served as a base of operations for him and his friends, also boasted enough safeguards to rival those of the Pentagon.</p><p>Drew liked living in Halagan well enough, although he\u2019d have to move on by the time the new year arrived. After several years of working undercover at GenHance, Inc., he had been exposed as a spy and had barely escaped being captured, killed, and dissected. Although outwardly he appeared to be nothing more than an ordinary, somewhat geeky computer nerd, Drew\u2019s DNA was something more than human, and had made him part of a secret new order of superhumans that had named themselves the Takyn.</p><p>Like his other friends, Drew had been genetically altered as an orphaned child by scientists working outside the law. No one knew exactly what they had intended, but their experiments had resulted in children with powerful, unique, and sometimes frightening psychic abilities. After an accident destroyed the main experimental facility and killed most of the geneticists working on the project, the surviving children\u2019s memories had been suppressed or erased before they were placed for adoption and scattered throughout the country. Neither the children nor their new families had any idea of what had been done to alter them.</p> <p>Their Takyn abilities remained dormant for the most part throughout their childhood, although some of the children showed minor, precursory abilities. As a boy Drew had always been able to sense the presence of copper, usually in the form of pennies on the ground. He was so good at finding the coins, some of his friends in the old neighborhood had used him like a metal detector. Then when he was nine, Drew had gone swimming in a nearby lake with some friends, swallowed some water after being dunked, and had contracted an amoebic infection that had caused his temperature to spike at one hundred and six degrees.</p><p>Later his mother had told him that the doctors had prepared her and his dad for the worst. \u201cThey said you had lesions on your brain, and if you did come out of it you might never be able to talk or understand or take care of yourself again.\u201d</p><p>Drew had stunned his parents and doctors by not only surviving, but coming out of the lethal sickness completely well. Aside from a nagging headache, he\u2019d apparently suffered no ill effects at all from the infection. Until his father woke him up one night to his mother\u2019s shrieking and water flooding across the floor of his room.</p><p>\u201cThe bathroom pipes burst,\u201d his dad had told him, shouting to be heard over his mother. \u201cCome and help your mom.\u201d</p><p>Drew got out of bed and followed his dad, but something tugged at him and he changed direction. The pipes in his house were old, and as he went down the hall of his one-story home he ran his hand along the wall, tracing the path of the pipe he couldn\u2019t see but could somehow feel.</p><p>\u201cAndrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on, Mom,\u201d he called back in an absent tone. He moved his hand over the wall as he sought out the weak spot in the pipes, and then found it. He could feel through the wall the ragged edges of the split in the metal and how they curled out like a tattered flower. His dad was going to have to get the plumber to knock a hole in the wall to get at the pipe.</p><p>Unless . . .</p><p>The headache he\u2019d had since returning from the hospital disappeared, and in its place came another feeling, a sizzling warmth that gathered behind his eyes. It traveled down into his shoulder and through his arm, moving like warm water, and seemed to pour through his hand into the wall. The water rushing across his feet began to slow, and then stopped.</p><p>\u201cThank God, your father finally got the water turned off. Oh, look at you,\u201d his mother said behind him. \u201cYou\u2019re soaked to the skin.\u201d</p><p>His dad came up the stairs from the basement. \u201cThe shutoff valve is too rusted to turn, Bridget. I\u2019d better call . . .\u201d He stopped and looked at the floor. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Drew turned and smiled at his father. \u201cI fixed it, Dad.\u201d</p><p>Ron Riordan stared at his son before he burst out laughing. \u201cAnd how did you do that, boy? With a prayer to the patron saint of piping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, with my headache.\u201d Drew grimaced as he glanced down at his pajamas, which were sodden to the knees. \u201cCan I change into my Transformers, Mom?\u201d</p><p>Bridget looked at the wall and then sighed. \u201cSure, darling. But you bring those wet things into the laundry room.\u201d</p><p>As Drew trotted back to his bedroom, he heard his mother say, \u201cBroken pipes don\u2019t go and mend themselves, Ronnie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething got stuck in it, I imagine. I\u2019m calling Crowley. He\u2019ll have something he can use to loosen up that geedee shutoff valve.\u201d</p><p>The next day Mr. Crowley, the neighborhood plumber, came early to inspect the damage. Drew had to go to school, and didn\u2019t give any more thought to the broken pipe until he found his father waiting for him outside the school gate.</p><p>\u201cDad.\u201d Drew couldn\u2019t remember his father ever coming to school to pick him up. Ron drove a bus, and didn\u2019t get home until after six every night. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took the day off, son. Boys.\u201d Ron nodded to the two friends Drew usually walked home with. \u201cCome on. Your mother\u2019s waiting in the car for us.\u201d</p><p>Drew wondered if he was in trouble, especially when he saw his mother\u2019s face. She looked as if she\u2019d been crying. \u201cDid I do something wrong, Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, son.\u201d Ron rested a hand on his shoulder. \u201cYour mother and me and you, we just need to have a little talk.\u201d</p><p>His father drove them to the park where Drew sometimes played ball with his friends. The bleachers were deserted today, however, and as they went to sit by the dugout he began to see that his parents weren\u2019t just upset; they were frightened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>Bridget sat down and took his hands in hers. \u201cLast night, Andy, when you were touching the wall, what did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fixed the pipe.\u201d He searched his parents\u2019 faces. \u201cDidn\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMr. Crowley cut a hole in the wall to look at it. The pipe did break there. At least . . .\u201d Bridget stopped and looked helplessly at Ron.</p><p>His father crouched down beside him. \u201cHow did you fix the pipe, boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt it through the wall,\u201d Drew said, trying to put the strange feelings into words. \u201cThe metal. I could feel where it was broken. Then my head got hot, and the heat went down my arm and into the wall. It made the pipe go back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou felt the metal.\u201d</p><p>Drew nodded. \u201cIt feels funny. Like . . .\u201d He paused to search for the right comparison. \u201cChristmas morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes it now?\u201d Ron fished a handful of change out of his pocket and put it in Drew\u2019s hand. \u201cCan you show me with this what you did to the metal?\u201d</p><p>Drew frowned at the coins. He couldn\u2019t feel the dimes or the nickels or quarters. \u201cNot with all of them.\u201d He picked out five pennies and handed the rest back to Ron. Then he concentrated, bringing back the warm feeling in his head as he held his hand open.</p><p>The pennies began to dance a little, which made him smile, and then he made them stand on end and roll in a circle. He spun the pennies faster, pouring more of the heat into them, and they began to stretch and melt into each other.</p><p>\u201cDear God in Heaven,\u201d he heard his mother whisper.</p><p>Drew felt proud. He made the pennies join together into a solid ring, and then pulled back some of the heat so it wouldn\u2019t burn his hand. When the copper stopped spinning, it was a perfect circle, the same size as the pretty bracelets his mom liked to wear.</p><p>It was cool to see what he couldn\u2019t last night, not with the wall in the way. He looked up at his dad. \u201cThat\u2019s what I did, kind of. Is it okay?\u201d</p> <p>His mom\u2019s fingers trembled as she took the bracelet. \u201cIt\u2019s only a little warm.\u201d She handed it to Ron, and then covered her face and began to sob.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Drew threw his arms around her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, darling. It\u2019s all right. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\u201d She choked back her sobs and wiped her face quickly before she rubbed her hands over his arms. \u201cIt was just . . . a surprise, sweetheart. But a good one.\u201d</p><p>Drew wasn\u2019t so sure about that. The only time he\u2019d seen his mother cry that hard was the day he\u2019d woken up in the hospital.</p><p>\u201cAndrew.\u201d His father looked stern now. \u201cDoes anyone else know you can do this thing? Have you told your friends at school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. Just you and Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His gruff voice sounded less strained now.</p><p>\u201cNow listen to me, boy. We can\u2019t be telling people outside our family about this, ah, thing you do.\u201d</p> <p>He almost asked why, and then he considered what he could do. No one that he knew could make metal dance. Well, there was Magneto in the X-Men comics, but he was a villain. Drew could never be a bad guy. He squinted up at his father. \u201cI\u2019m kind of like a superhero, aren\u2019t I? That\u2019s why we have to keep it secret?\u201d</p><p>His parents exchanged another long look before his father said, \u201cYes, Andrew. That\u2019s why.\u201d</p><p>Bridget squeezed his hands in hers. \u201cYou have to be careful with this, darling. Being able to make the metal dance is fun, I\u2019m sure, but metal can be hard and sharp, and you could hurt yourself. Your friends, your teachers, or even me and your dad. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>On some level Drew knew that metal would never hurt him, but his mother was right\u2014he might accidentally burn someone when he made it hot, or cut them when he made it into different shapes. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>She kissed his forehead. \u201cNow I think we need to go to Haskin\u2019s Ice Cream Shop and have some hot fudge sundaes. I know I do, very badly.\u201d</p><p>From that day on, Drew never had cause to regret revealing his ability to his parents. It didn\u2019t change their feelings toward him, and if anything made them all closer. Over the years his father worked with him on learning the extent of his ability and what he could do with it, and in the process taught Drew more about copper, its properties and uses, than the average metallurgist knew.</p><p>Although she didn\u2019t tell him until he\u2019d graduated college, from that day on his mother quietly began trying to find his birth records and through them his biological parents. She and Ron had adopted him as a baby through a placement program run by their church, but there were almost no records of Drew\u2019s birth aside from a hastily written police report about an older, unidentified man bringing him to an emergency room shortly after his birth and abandoning him there.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if you just appeared out of nowhere,\u201d Bridget said sadly. \u201cYour mother was probably his daughter or granddaughter, and gave birth at home. At least he took you where you\u2019d be safe and cared for.\u201d</p><p>Thanks to the love of his parents, Drew had always lived comfortably with his ability. Even after learning of how he and the other Takyn had been meddled with, knowing what some of the other Takyn could do made him feel as if he\u2019d gotten the kind end of the DNA swizzle stick. One of his oldest friends among the Takyn, a man he knew as Paracelsus, was plagued with visions of the past, often so real that more than once they had almost destroyed his mind. His newest friend, Jessa Bellamy, could see the darkest secrets in anyone\u2019s soul just by touching them.</p><p>And then there was Rowan.</p><p>As he thought of her, Drew settled down at his computer to pull up the tracking program he\u2019d initiated on Rowan. She didn\u2019t know that before they had parted ways in Savannah, he had planted a GPS locator on her bike. Matthias, a former Roman soldier who had survived two thousand years of accidental burial in ice, and the oldest of the Takyn, hadn\u2019t asked him to do it, but at the time Drew had thought it would be a good idea to keep tabs on Miss Independence. When he told Matthias about it, the older man had agreed it was a smart move.</p><p>Drew had followed her progress as she rode from Savannah toward Boston, where she had found a job working for another of their Takyn friends. The signal told him only where she was, not what she was doing, but it comforted Drew to know. Rowan might be tough as nails, but she was also young and on her own\u2014and hurting.</p><p>Jessa had confirmed his suspicions. \u201cI think Rowan left us because she was in love with Matthias. It would have been hard for her to stay and watch me with him, especially now with the baby coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is Maximus Junior?\u201d Drew asked.</p><p>\u201cAt the moment, trying to kick a hole through my spleen,\u201d she said wryly. \u201cBut that\u2019s better than the morning sickness. Listen, Drew, I know Rowan is proud and needs to go it alone and all, but she\u2019s still so young. If she calls you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to her,\u201d he assured her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. With some time and distance, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>Tonight he expected her to be through New York City and well into Connecticut, but the signal track still showed her at the border between New Jersey and New York City.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, stopping for an egg cream?\u201d he murmured as he zoomed in and watched the tiny bright light move across the Hudson. \u201cYou should have moved out here with me, girl. I\u2019d have taught you to surf.\u201d Just as soon as he learned.</p><p>Drew picked up his cordless and dialed the number to Matthias\u2019s farm in Tennessee. Jessa answered, and after exchanging pleasantries put Matthias on the phone.</p><p>\u201cAre you well?\u201d was the older man\u2019s first question.</p><p>\u201cWell and truly bored. I haven\u2019t been able to hack through GenHance\u2019s new security measures. I think I taught my staff a little too well,\u201d he said, referring to his old job working as chief of the technical department. \u201cAny word from Rowan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has not called us. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m looking at her right now. She\u2019s screwing around somewhere in New York City.\u201d He frowned as the signal fluttered, and then winked out. \u201cShit.\u201d He attacked the keyboard, trying to boost the signal. No light. \u201cShe just disappeared off the radar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means the locator isn\u2019t putting out a signal anymore. Maybe she found it and tossed it in the river. I\u2019d better give her a call. Hold on.\u201d Drew picked up his disposable mobile phone, dialed Rowan\u2019s number, and put it on speaker.</p><p>\u201cThis is not me,\u201d Rowan\u2019s voice said. \u201cThis is computerized bullshit pretending to be me. Leave a name and number at the tone, or this is all you\u2019ll ever listen to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRo, it\u2019s David. Give me a call back right away.\u201d He switched off the mobile and spoke into the cordless. \u201cHer phone is going straight to voice mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may be angry about finding the locator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Drew frowned at the screen map. \u201cThat\u2019s probably it. I\u2019ll wait for her to call.\u201d</p><p>Rowan never slept well the first night in a new place, but for once her periodic insomnia didn\u2019t keep her watching infomercials until dawn. She didn\u2019t even bother to turn on the small television in the apartment Dansant was letting her use, but went into the bedroom, unfolded the long black futon, and flopped down on it to judge the fit. Most day-beds and singles were too short for her long frame, but this one was an oversized full with a decent mattress. The last thing she remembered doing was looking up at the beaded honey pine ceiling, and thinking it was a lot newer than the oak and cherry checkerwork parquet floor.</p><p>Then nothing. Just sweet, endless, dreamless sleep.</p><p>She opened her eyes to the same ceiling, and lay there for a time, letting the sunlight from the three old casement windows play over her. From the strength and position of the sun she judged it to be early afternoon, which meant she\u2019d slept six or seven hours straight. She had plenty of time before her first shift started at six. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rowan knew how lucky she was. I could be in a hospital right now, scaring the shit out of some doctors.</p><p>Her knees throbbed a little, but from the slight pulling and stiffness she felt when she bent them she knew they were already heavily scabbed over. Tomorrow the scabs would fall off and the lacerations would be gone. Another bonus from the mad scientists who had fucked with her genes when she was a kid; she never got sick and she healed almost as fast as she got hurt.</p><p>She rolled over, hugging her pillow as she lazily replayed bits and pieces of her conversation last night with Dansant.</p> <p>You\u2019re really going to let me stay here? She\u2019d come out of the large bedroom into the spacious front room, which combined a large sitting room with a breakfast/dining area that opened out onto a private terrace. The furnishings were basic\u2014a futon, side table and lamp in the bedroom, and a loveseat, armchair and kitchen set in the front, but everything was clean and in good condition. There was also a closet stocked with fresh, neatly folded linens and towels. You could get three, four thousand a month for this place, easy.</p><p>Not everyone wishes to live above a restaurant, Rowan. You must also share the bath with the other tenant.</p><p>She\u2019d already taken a peek at the big full bath situated between the two apartments. Someone had recently updated the plumbing with European-style fixtures, and paved every inch of it but the ceiling in quarried stone tiles the color of old honey spilled on polished slate. Rowan could easily imagine spending several hours soaking in the big beautiful claw-footed tub. The lock on the door works, right?</p><p>Oui.</p><p>After that Dansant had handed her the keys, smiled, and left her to it. Total access, complete trust.</p> <p>The man was a saint. The man was insane.</p><p>Hunger drove Rowan out of bed, and after rummaging through the stuff she\u2019d taken from her bike panniers, she found an unopened bag of her favorite trail mix. An investigation of the tiny kitchenette\u2019s cabinets and drawers produced a clean mug and a spoon. She ran the hot water tap until it was scalding\u2014as she\u2019d figured, the restaurant\u2019s water heater was set to an inferno temperature\u2014and using some gratis packets she\u2019d swiped from the last motel she\u2019d stayed at, mixed up a cup of coffee.</p><p>Now all I need is a big half- naked guy to feed me grapes and fan me, and I\u2019ll know I\u2019m in heaven.</p><p>Carrying her improvised breakfast out onto the terrace felt completely natural, as did sitting in the wicker patio chair and watching the tail end of city lunch hour gridlock. Her neighbor\u2019s apartment was on the opposite side of the building, so if he had a terrace it overlooked the alley. She even had the better view.</p><p>That it was all a little too good to be true didn\u2019t bother her. Rowan felt safe, and she hadn\u2019t felt that way since leaving Savannah. Her normal alarms and alerts simply weren\u2019t going off. Dansant was a decent guy who had shown her nothing but kindness and compassion. Whatever strings came along with this minor miracle, it seemed for now she was going to enjoy it.</p><p>The nuts, raisins, and chocolate in her trail mix quieted the snarling beast that lived in her belly, but she\u2019d need to shop before she started work tonight to stock up on some supplies. Dansant had told her he made a traditional family meal every night for the staff, and she was welcome to use whatever she wanted from the pantry, but she was already taking advantage of him. She had enough cash to cover the basics, and from the wages they\u2019d agreed on she\u2019d have another thirty or forty dollars to spend on food every week. As long as she didn\u2019t splurge, that should cover her needs.</p> <p>Dansant had promised her that Meriden, the guy who lived in the other apartment, wouldn\u2019t charge much to work on her bike, but Rowan had a feeling that was going to be a much bigger expense. Even if Meriden could get them discounted, new tires alone were going to run at least three hundred bucks.</p><p>She calculated her expenses, along with repaying Dansant for what he\u2019d given Bernard and what she roughly estimated the bike repairs would be. If she had no other unexpected expenses, she should be able to earn enough for everything by the end of January at the latest.</p><p>Looks like I\u2019m spending Christmas in New York. She\u2019d dreaded the thought of getting through the holidays alone and friendless in Boston. Here maybe she\u2019d be allowed to share a little of the festivities with Dansant and his crew.</p><p>Since the sisters who had taken her in and looked after her had died, she hadn\u2019t spent Christmas with anyone. Matt had never celebrated the holidays, and she hadn\u2019t tried to change that because he had already been coping with an entire world of changes that had come about in the two thousand years since he\u2019d served as a soldier in the Roman army. Rowan had explained Christmas to him once, and he\u2019d been appalled.</p><p>\u201cI know of this man,\u201d he said. \u201cIesus Nazarenus. He caused much unrest in Judea. Many were killed in the riots. But his people did not call him Jesus or Christ. He was known among his own kind as Y\u2019hoshua.\u201d</p><p>Even now, Rowan giggled over the thought of the Son of God being called the ancient equivalent of Joshua. If not for the Romans and how they translated Hebrew into Latin, they might be celebrating Joshmas. Still grinning, she swallowed the rest of her sugary coffee before raiding her pack again for fresh clothes and her bathroom stuff.</p><p>As Rowan took a towel from the closet she wondered when Meriden used the shared bath. Dansant had told her only that her neighbor worked days; she hoped he preferred to shower in the morning or evening. Working in a busy kitchen all night was a messy business, and she knew from experience that she\u2019d need to bathe before she went to bed. But if it caused problems, she could give herself a quick bath inside her apartment. As long as she had running water and a sink, she never had to go to bed sweaty or smelly.</p><p>Rowan bundled her things together and let herself out of the apartment, locking the door behind her. She heard footsteps behind her and smiled as she turned.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d She stopped as soon as she saw the size of the man coming out of the opposite apartment. Definitely too tall and broad to be her new boss. \u201cOh, sorry. I thought you were someone else.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door and pocketed a bunch of keys before facing her.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Meriden.\u201d She held out her free hand. \u201cI\u2019m Rowan, your new neighbor.\u201d When he ignored the gesture, she dropped her arm. He might think he was insulting her, but she was suddenly, irrationally glad she didn\u2019t have to touch him. And for the life of her she couldn\u2019t remember if Dansant had told her his first name. \u201cYou are Mr. Meriden, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Meriden.\u201d The dark landing kept his face in shadow, but from the pitch of his rumbling baritone he didn\u2019t sound like he was smiling. \u201cDidn\u2019t waste any time moving in, did you?\u201d</p><p>Suspicious, but this was New York, and she would be living ten feet from his door. \u201cI don\u2019t have much stuff.\u201d Although she understood the need for his being cautious, she couldn\u2019t help adding on in her head, Are you always this much of a jerk?</p><p>He reached past her head and switched on a light.</p><p>In the dark Meriden resembled a distant linebacker, big but anonymous. Illuminated by the overhead light, he looked like a pissed-off gladiator who ate linebackers for an afternoon snack, and used girls like Rowan as a toothpick.</p><p>I have every right to be here, she reminded herself, straightening her shoulders. This is Dansant\u2019s place. Not his.</p><p>Meriden wasn\u2019t at all handsome like her new boss, thank God. Everything about him reminded her of forged metals, from the quarter inch of white-blond hair covering his scalp to the dark gold stubble darkening his jaw and chin. His summer tan hadn\u2019t completely faded from his fair skin, but she suspected he\u2019d look just as scary with a winter-pale hide. Life or luck had hammered and beaten his features into a collection of hard edges and dented planes, lending him a rough-hewn look more suited to less-civilized times. He would have made an excellent gladiator, too; beneath his slanted brows dark eyes watched her with unnerving stillness.</p><p>If he were about to die, Rowan thought, he wouldn\u2019t salute anyone. He\u2019d already be chopping someone to pieces.</p><p>The stretched white A-line undershirt tried to cover some of Meriden\u2019s chest, but the standard male dimensions it had been manufactured to fit simply didn\u2019t apply to Meriden\u2019s Olympian build. He hadn\u2019t pumped up; he\u2019d grown out, somehow creating layer upon layer of heroic, sculpted muscle that belonged in some arena where barbarians were butchered and tigers were wrestled.</p><p>Living with Matthias, Rowan had grown accustomed to being around a man whose body had been developed to optimum levels. Matt had merely maintained what a lifetime of battle experience had shaped, but he had become her standard, the mental yardstick with which she measured all other men and found them lacking.</p><p>Her next-door neighbor wasn\u2019t Matthias. He was bigger, wider, harder, and\u2014if all that brute muscle wasn\u2019t false advertising\u2014as strong as if not stronger than her old friend.</p><p>\u201cSeen enough?\u201d he asked. \u201cOr should I drop my pants?\u201d</p><p>Rowan should have snapped back with something equally insulting, but she had been staring at him like a love-struck kid. She glanced down at Meriden\u2019s faded jeans, which sported an impressive amount of smears, spots, and stains. The seam edges had frayed into a short white fringe, and a split ran across the lower part of his left thigh.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said honestly as she glanced up into his dark-hearted eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sure my heart can take any more.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t laugh. Such a specimen of rugged masculinity in its most intense form never came equipped with a sense of humor, of course. That would mean there was a God and He liked her.</p><p>\u201cLook, I took a spill last night in the alley,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cMy bike needs new front and rear tires and some repair work. Dansant told me that you\u2019re a mechanic. Maybe you could look at the damage and give me an estimate?\u201d</p><p>The way he was glaring down at her made her think he was going to refuse, but then he surprised her again. \u201cI\u2019ve got another job to do. It\u2019ll have to wait \u2019til next week.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She nodded, feeling a little relieved that she\u2019d have some time to build up her cash supply. \u201cAre you okay with me making payments for the repairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to Dansant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can put down about a hundred\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019ll pay me. You pay him.\u201d</p><p>Rowan let it go. \u201cOkay. The only other thing is working out the bathroom arrangements.\u201d She gestured at the door between their apartments. \u201cIs there any specific time you need it to shower, shave, whatever?\u201d He didn\u2019t reply. \u201cI\u2019d like to use it after my shift, around two a.m., and whenever I get up in the morning, probably around ten or eleven. That okay with you?\u201d</p><p>He kept silent, kept watching her.</p><p>Patience had never been one of her virtues. \u201cIt\u2019s a yes or no question, Meriden. A simple head movement should cover it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what the fuck you do, Cupcake.\u201d He bent his head so she could see directly into his eyes. Now they were diamond hard and demon black, as if he were an icy volcano ready to blow. \u201cJust stay out of my way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d The sting of Cupcake made her add an insulting amount of wattage to her smile. \u201cSoon as you get the hell out of mine, Farm Boy.\u201d</p><p>Meriden took a step to the side, creating just enough space for her to edge past him without causing physical contact. Rowan ignored the heat of his huge body, and how it warmed the suddenly oversensitive skin of her cheek and throat, but the smell of him, as cool and dark as a midnight tide, filled her head. She refused to fiddle with the bathroom door or glance back at him. She wasn\u2019t some kid for him to scare into scurrying away.</p><p>Cupcake my ass.</p><p>She managed a casual \u201cSee you around\u201d before she stepped inside and carefully closed the door behind her. Which was a good thing, because somehow in spite of her fury her knees were liquefying and she was trembling all over.</p><p>Rowan listened, but she didn\u2019t pick up his steps moving away or hitting the stairs. He was still standing there on the other side, waiting for something. Her heart bounced in her throat as she groped behind her for the locking latch, and twisted it.</p><p>After a long moment, heavy footsteps moved across the landing and down the stairs. A few seconds later the back kitchen door opened and slammed shut.</p> <p>He was gone, and she was sliding down the door until she sat on the floor in a muddled, jittery mess. Rowan hugged her legs with her arms and pressed her forehead to her knees, willing herself to calm down. So Meriden was an oversized, bad-tempered jackass; at least she knew that up front. He worked days; she would be working nights. All she needed to do was learn his schedule and avoid him whenever he was coming or going.</p><p>Then she\u2019d work on figuring out why it wasn\u2019t terror that was making her shake like this.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Dansant came to open the restaurant after sunset, but instead of posting the menu for the night he went directly to the back stairs to see if Rowan had come down yet. She was already in the kitchen, walking around and inspecting everything.</p><p>For a moment he watched her, unsure if he would have the same unsettling reaction as last night.</p><p>He had intended only to see to her wounds and assure himself that she did not need to be taken to the hospital. That much he would swear to. But as soon as he had closed the door, the scent of her enfolded him, sinking into him and going straight to his head.</p><p>Dansant had controlled himself until she had uttered those words: All right, Dansant. Do whatever you want.</p><p>Rowan remembered nothing of what had happened next, of course. Later, after he had regained his control, he had taken the memories from her as easily as he had brought her under his influence.</p> <p>Rowan. Look at me. Look.</p><p>Your eyes\u2014something . . . wrong . . .</p><p>Her own had widened as she resisted him for a moment, and then her lashes drifted down, framing the faint reflection of shining turquoise from his own.</p><p>Now the same longing and hunger besieged him as soon as he breathed in her scent, but while it was as intense as before, he seemed to have a better grip on his self-control now.</p><p>Dansant also felt a terrible weight lift from his heart, as if some part of him had been convinced she would be gone before he came here, before he could touch her again. But she had stayed. She must have slept well, too, for her color was better and her eyes brighter, although she still moved with some residual stiffness. Her head turned as she became aware of his presence and she smiled, although that seemed carefully measured as well; just so much of a welcome and no more.</p><p>She must feel the same as I, he thought. But if she does, she does not wish me to know it any more than I want her to remember what I did to her. \u201cBonsoir, Rowan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, boss.\u201d She had dressed simply in jeans and a T-shirt, and had tied a blue bandanna around her dark curls.</p><p>She appeared younger tonight, barely more than an adolescent, which helped steady him. Compared to him she was a child, one who needed a friend more than a lover. He would keep reminding himself of that. \u201cYou look as if you slept well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>Last night he had not wasted time with polite inquiries or any sort of finesse. As soon as Rowan\u2019s defenses had fallen he had stood and placed his hands on either side of her face. She smiled blindly up at him, her lips parted, her soft skin warm against his palms.</p><p>He had watched her eyes as he slid his fingers into her hair, angling her face so that the overhead lights bathed every inch of her. She was a midnight jewel, this girl, alabaster moon-skinned and onyx star-eyed.</p><p>Her mouth, soft and gentle and unguarded, had drawn him down. As their lips met, her breath whispered out of her, a silent sigh that he covered and drank in.</p><p>\u201cReady to put me to work?\u201d</p><p>Her voice brought him back to the present. Glad to have something to do other than remember what he had done to her, Dansant took a white bib apron from the stacks shelved above the sink and gave it to her.</p><p>\u201cI will show you the setup of the kitchen, the stations, and how we do things before the others arrive,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe begin preparations at seven and seat at nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the seventy-seven for?\u201d she asked as she tied on the apron, looking down at the small embroidered patch on the left side of the bib.</p><p>\u201cIt is the restaurant\u2019s logo,\u201d he told her. \u201cThe street number for our building is seventy-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo remind people where you are. Smart. You could have called the restaurant 77, too. Everyone remembers digi-named places, like 17 Murray, or 2 West at the Ritz-Carlton.\u201d</p><p>He thought of the true meaning of the number. \u201cI prefer D\u2019Anges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a French restaurant, that doesn\u2019t hurt, either.\u201d She smoothed down the tapered pockets below the waist ties.</p><p>He watched her hands as he recalled the taste of her. Her mouth had been especially luscious, rich and sweet, like brandied pears. His first taste of her had led to a second, and a third, and then to an endless, mindless kiss that tore into him, deep and savage as a jagged blade.</p><p>\u201cDansant?\u201d When he looked at her, she asked, \u201cWhy do you seat so late?\u201d</p><p>Late? Last night he had lifted her from the crate and held her against him, all his to do with as he pleased. Now he had to chat with her as if none of it had happened. \u201cWe seat late to, ah, discourage the before-timers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been so wrapped up in his recollections that he\u2019d forgotten the term in English. \u201cIt is like capons. No, not them.\u201d Just when he thought he could speak her language well enough, he stumbled over something like this. \u201cOlder people who arrive at opening and expect special pricing.\u201d</p><p>Her smile flashed. \u201cEarly birds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui.\u201d He turned his head so he wouldn\u2019t stare at her mouth.</p><p>Last night he had been intent on that, hers and his. In the thrall of pleasure he had forgotten that he had brought her inside to care for her, but it had never been like that for him. He had come to this country and lived this life not of his choosing because there had been nothing left of him or for him. That he woke every night and found he was still alive, still able to live, seemed a miracle each time he opened his eyes.</p><p>After learning what had happened to him in France, he had never dared dream of more.</p><p>Now this woman had crashed into his life, and she was looking at him with no knowledge or understanding of what he was, or what he would never again be.</p><p>\u201cNo early birds,\u201d she said. \u201cCheck.\u201d</p><p>He had to move away from her, so strong was the compulsion to touch her. He had to get on with it, this charade of employing her.</p><p>\u201cThe work begins here,\u201d Dansant told her as he led her out to the back entry door. \u201cEverything we do in the kitchen is by design\u2014la marche en avant.\u201d</p><p>Rowan frowned. \u201cWe\u2019re moving backward out of the kitchen, not forward.\u201d</p><p>She had managed to surprise him again. \u201cYou understand French?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can read it, not speak it.\u201d She sounded defensive now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve . . . worked in a couple restaurants, and picked up some stuff from books, mostly kitchen and cooking terms. It sure doesn\u2019t sound the same as it looks on paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have a natural ear for it, I think.\u201d Dansant decided to test her. \u201cI will say the French for each place in the kitchen, and you will tell me what it is in English and what you know of it.\u201d He gestured at the door. \u201cEntr\u00e9e, r\u00e9ception des mati\u00e8res.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEntrance and receiving,\u201d she translated. \u201cWhere everything comes through and is delivered.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and moved to the right into the main storage room. \u201cStockage \u00e0 sec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDry storage, where you put the dry goods.\u201d She made a face. \u201cI cheated. I looked at the shelves and guessed.\u201d</p><p>From there he introduced her to the three chambres froids used to store meat, frozen goods, and fruits and vegetables; the l\u00e9gumerie where the vegetables were washed; and the plonge sinks and equipment on the opposite side of the section for cleaning pots and dishes. She correctly identified each one and even began echoing the words he said in French under her breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It pleased him that she wanted to improve her understanding of his language. Years of living in New York had taught him that few Americans were willing to make such an effort.</p><p>\u201cWhy is everything sectioned off this way?\u201d Rowan asked after he had brought her back into the front of the kitchen. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier to do all the prep work in one area, have the storage units together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsing la marche en avant, the staff assure that work is done in the correct order,\u201d he explained, \u201cwith no clean foods coming near the unclean things like garbage and soiled dishes.\u201d</p> <p>Her expression cleared. \u201cOkay. So everything moves clockwise until it\u2019s plated and ready to be served: delivery, initial prep, storage, hot and cold prep, plating, then service.\u201d She waited until he nodded. \u201cTrash and bus bins are brought through the side door and go down that way to the sinks and the compactor, away from the food.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at how quickly she comprehended what had taken the French three hundred years to perfect. \u201cYou must have worked at many restaurants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, only a bakery shop\u2014Emmanuel\u2019s P\u00e2tisserie,\u201d she amended. \u201cWe had a couple of tables out in front for coffee, cakes, sandwiches, that kind of thing. Manny ran his kitchen the same way you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he was French, or taught by a Frenchman.\u201d Dansant escorted her to the center cuisine island, where the bulk of the cooking was done, and explained the layout of the equipment. \u201cHere we have cooktops and stoves on this side, rotisseries and broilers on the other. The brigade de cuisine work mainly here, but the garde-manger, r\u00f4tisseur, saucier, and p\u00e2tissier all have their own mise en place at their stations where they ready the food for final cooking. When the orders begin they will go through their provisions quickly and call for what they need from cold or dry storage. That is when you will collect it for them, and perhaps assist or plate for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLater, after we have our family meal, you will help clean and sanitize the kitchen surfaces.\u201d He saw her palm as she tucked back a curl that had strayed from the edge of her bandanna, and caught her wrist without thinking. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hand.\u201d She sounded puzzled. \u201cI come equipped with two of them.\u201d</p><p>So she did. Last night both of her palms had been grazed, but not deeply enough to mar her fair skin. Now he saw no trace of them.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t as scratched up as I thought,\u201d she said quickly, as if she had read his thoughts. \u201cIt was mostly blood from my knees. I must have grabbed them right after I crashed.\u201d</p><p>She was lying now. \u201cHow are your knees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSore.\u201d She checked the chunky watch she wore, deftly removing her hand from his in the process. \u201cWho takes care of cleaning up the restaurant tables and stuff out front?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe front of the house,\u201d he corrected. \u201cA cleaning crew comes two days each week. The waiters and service manager see to the rest before they finish their shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo all we have to worry about is keeping the kitchen clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone tends to their own stations. The rest we do together.\u201d He regarded her steadily, trying to see what else he had missed last night. She had the unmarked, translucent skin of a child, and he saw no lines or other indications of her age. \u201cHow old are you, Rowan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-one. Completely legal.\u201d She didn\u2019t like him asking. \u201cWhat, you want to see my ID?\u201d</p><p>Dansant wondered if it would be genuine. He had not intruded on her mind last night more than was absolutely necessary\u2014he had violated her enough by holding and kissing her\u2014but certainly she was young. Perhaps she spoke the truth, and was nothing more than what she appeared, but now doubt brought with it one possible explanation for what had compelled him to touch her. \u201cWhere is your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you last night, I don\u2019t have any.\u201d</p><p>He had to be sure. \u201cNo parents, brothers, sisters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d Her tone grew bitter. \u201cI was abandoned at birth, and raised in foster care. No one has ever claimed me as their daughter or sister or third cousin twice removed, but then, they probably would have gone to jail for child abandonment if they had.\u201d She turned away from him.</p> <p>Dansant felt like an ogre for pressing her, but from the scant details she had given him he would have to know more. Silently he decided to have Meriden perform a discreet background check on his newest employee as soon as possible. \u201cI did not ask to be rude, Rowan. Je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9.\u201d His staff would soon be arriving, and he had yet to post the menu for the night. \u201cHow is your handwriting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReadable, but nothing fancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it is a thousand times better than mine.\u201d He took down the big blackboard and handed her a piece of chalk. \u201cWe offer a small menu each night, five plats principals with hors d\u2019oeuvres and desserts that suit them. We list the main courses on the board in French and English.\u201d</p><p>She held the chalk above the board. \u201cFire away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoup de mer r\u00f4ti aux herbes,\u201d he told her as he moved to stand beside her and watch.</p><p>\u201cRoasted sea wolf?\u201d Her grin reappeared. \u201cIs that with or without the fur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoasted sea bass,\u201d he corrected, \u201cwith herbs only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why not just call it bass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be confusing.\u201d He loved to see her smile. \u201cIn French, bass is un instrument de musique.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is in English, too,\u201d she assured him, \u201cand we never get confused.\u201d</p><p>He pointed at the board. \u201cLoup de mer, if you please.\u201d</p><p>Dansant gave her the rest of the menu, throughout which she joked and even constructed a kind of story. His poulet demi-deuil was not a chicken with a truffle-stuffed skin, but a depressed widowed hen; the filet de boeuf au vin had done something unspeakable to the hen\u2019s coq, probably by stewing him in the petits pois aux morilles, or dropping him in with the cabbage and potatoes to make trinxat.</p><p>\u201cThe poor chick,\u201d Rowan sighed as she finished writing the last item on the board in English. \u201cShe loses her guy to a side of beef, stuffs herself with high-priced \u2019shrooms, and then ends up roasting for it.\u201d She chuckled as she gave him a sideways glance. \u201cAin\u2019t love grand?\u201d</p><p>Dansant\u2019s amusement faded. Love was not grand; it was tragedy, it was horror. For him, there could never be love.</p><p>Last night, when Rowan had been in his arms, she had murmured something against his mouth, and another voice woke inside his head.</p><p>This life was never yours. Neither is she.</p><p>In dousing his need, that voice had been as effective as a fire hose. Dansant had groaned as he pushed Rowan from him, holding her arm only to keep her from collapsing. Commanding her made her pliant but also temporarily stripped her of her power of mind and will; she would do nothing but respond willingly to his desires. Even in that she had no choice, and once more Dansant was reminded of the monster that he was beneath his civilized veneer, that he could do this to a being as helpless as she.</p><p>\u201cBefore I kissed you,\u201d he said to her, \u201cdid you want me? Give me your truth, Rowan.\u201d</p><p>She nodded slowly, and then shook her head.</p><p>It seemed she shared his confusion. \u201cDo you have a lover or husband?\u201d Another shake of her head. At least he had not trespassed on another man\u2019s claim. \u201cYou will remember nothing of this. As before, you will feel safe and at ease with me. You will trust me as you do a friend.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help adding, \u201cMore so than any of your other friends.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d taken his hands from her, and knelt before her, and after releasing her from his control had tended to her injuries. She would never remember the kissing or the touching. Or how close she had come to being stripped and dragged to the floor and fucked until she screamed for him.</p><p>\u201cDansant?\u201d A slim hand waved in front of his face. \u201cYou keep zoning out on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me.\u201d Not for the first time he wished he could erase his own memories. \u201cTalk of love . . . it is not always so grand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got burned?\u201d Her chin dropped. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a friend,\u201d he lied. \u201cHe lost his beloved one, and it sent him into hell. I did what I could; I tried to bring him back to life, but he . . . he suffers still.\u201d Part of it was true. They had both suffered, each in their own way, after discovering what had been and never would be again.</p><p>Her eyes became distant. \u201cThat\u2019s why they call it true love, I guess.\u201d A rumble came from the alley, and she put down the chalk. \u201cSounds like the first delivery is here. I\u2019ll get it.\u201d</p><p>As Rowan went to the back door, Dansant looked up the shadowy flight of stairs, almost expecting to see Meriden there, waiting, listening. He could almost see his black eyes, staring at him, knowing everything, despising him for what he had done to Rowan. Hating him for what he was, wanting to kill him.</p><p>It was a pity, Dansant thought, that he was already dead.</p><p>\u201cWhadayawanmista?\u201d</p><p>Meriden glanced at the menu board over the counter. \u201cLarge black coffee and a bow tie.\u201d</p><p>The tired-eyed girl nodded, cracking her gum as she punched the picture keys on her register. \u201cThree-ohseven.\u201d</p><p>He handed her four bucks. \u201cKeep the change.\u201d</p><p>She worked up a smile for him. \u201cThanks.\u201d After she\u2019d poured and handed him his coffee, she went to the doughnut racks. \u201cOh, crap. Mister, the bow ties aren\u2019t out yet.\u201d</p><p>Which was why he\u2019d ordered one. \u201cI\u2019ll be sitting over there.\u201d He nodded to a corner table.</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d She turned to the next customer. \u201cWhadayawanlady?\u201d</p><p>Meriden sat down and sampled the coffee, which was drinkable, and took out his notepad and the photo of Alana King. When the counter girl walked over with his bow tie wrapped in a two-sided bag, she saw the photo.</p><p>\u201cThat your daughter? She\u2019s cute.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, this is a girl I\u2019m looking for.\u201d He checked the counter, which was clear. \u201cShe was seen here getting some coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKid that age?\u201d She folded over her bottom lip. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019d remember selling coffee to a little one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s older now. About sixteen.\u201d</p> <p>The counter girl glanced back before she sat down across from him. \u201cIs this that missing kid? I talked to a couple detectives about her.\u201d She gave him a suspicious look. \u201cYou a cop, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivate investigator.\u201d He showed her his identification and license. \u201cI\u2019m working for her father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRunaway, huh?\u201d She grimaced. \u201cThe cops don\u2019t care much about missing kids unless they\u2019re real young. So what do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to a witness who saw her here, you waited on her. She bought a small coffee, and you gave her a muffin.\u201d He saw the uneasiness in her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m not going to say anything to your manager. I just wanted to know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the girl I think you mean, she\u2019s a street kid. You know, living out there.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to give out stuff, but it\u2019s hard, you know, when they look at stuff on the racks, and they pay in nickels and pennies, and you know they ain\u2019t got enough to get something else.\u201d She looked down at the table as if she was ashamed. \u201cMy ma, she says they can go to a soup kitchen or a church any time, but I can\u2019t help it. I mean, a muffin, come on, it\u2019s not a big thing. And she buys something every time she comes in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s been here more than once.\u201d</p><p>The counter girl nodded. \u201cShe comes in regular, late at night. Maybe a couple times a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else about her you can tell me?\u201d When she shrugged, he added, \u201cDoes she always leave in the same direction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t look after they leave the counter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you remember anything else\u201d\u2014he slid one of his business cards across the table\u2014\u201cgive me a call. Anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Her expression turned dubious.</p> <p>\u201cOne more thing.\u201d He slid a ten across the table. \u201cA muffin is something, and you\u2019re a good person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She offered him a genuine smile. \u201cI just wish it was enough.\u201d She pocketed the ten and went back to work.</p><p>Meriden worked the area for the rest of the morning, questioning the merchants with businesses around the coffee shop, and making no headway on the case. He grabbed a sandwich before he went to the garage, where he intended to put in a couple of hours before he called it a day.</p><p>Rowan Dietrich\u2019s bike sat at the back of his bay, delivered there by a tow-truck driver who owed him a favor. He resented it like everything else Dansant stuck him with, but the sooner he got it repaired, the sooner the girl would be on her way.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like her living in his back pocket, but he had to admit she had a sweet ride. He\u2019d spent a lot of time biking when he\u2019d lived overseas, both for convenience and to save money. A motorcycle didn\u2019t require as much fuel, which was outrageously expensive over there, and it could be parked almost anywhere. He suddenly realized why he disliked the bike so much. It was a Ducati.</p><p>Nathan had loved Italian racing bikes.</p><p>Although his own years in Europe were just a blur of anger and confusion now, Meriden could clearly remember a few things about Nathan. The rest he\u2019d put together after some careful, painstaking research. He\u2019d been sent to Rome to study, but he\u2019d left there after a year to hitchhike his way across a half- dozen countries, paying his way by picking up work as a cook. He\u2019d met Gisele at her father\u2019s restaurant, and it had been all over for Nathan the moment she smiled at him. She felt the same, for she had been the one to convince old Giusti to take him on as an apprentice.</p><p>Meriden knew Nathan had fallen for her, hard, and had gambled everything to have her. They\u2019d had only a year together, but from all accounts they\u2019d been incredibly happy. If the dark men hadn\u2019t come for Nathan, he\u2019d still be there, cooking beside Gisele\u2019s father.</p> <p>When he\u2019d learned the details of what had happened to the Giustis, Meriden had gone back to Nice to make sure Nathan was dead. He\u2019d bribed a hospital employee in Nice to obtain copies of the medical records. Nathan had been horribly burned in the accident that had killed his wife, and despite attempts to resuscitate him, had died that night in the hospital. His death certificate had been signed by the attending physician.</p><p>The facts were undeniable. Irrefutable. Inescapable. Pain spiked through Meriden\u2019s skull. Thinking of those days gave him a migraine; if he didn\u2019t stop he\u2019d end up locked in a dark room. He\u2019d accepted what had happened to Nathan, how he had died, and the bizarre aftereffects that had brought Sean together with Dansant in France. One accident, one horrific, tragic choice, and three lives had been changed forever. Sometimes he wondered what Nathan would think of him and Dansant. If he would be as accepting, or if he\u2019d want them dead, too.</p><p>If he had known what would happen, Sean thought, would he have still run into the flames?</p><p>Despite his and Dansant\u2019s efforts to discover the truth about Nathan\u2019s past, and if there was any possibility of it affecting them in some way, there were still countless, troubling gaps in the man\u2019s personal history. Nathan had gone to Rome, but then he had disappeared for almost a year. There were no records of when he had left Italy or how he had traveled to France; it was as if he\u2019d simply rematerialized there. He\u2019d been running from something, or he wouldn\u2019t have gone to the trouble of forging his papers and creating an entirely new identity for himself. He\u2019d done an excellent job of becoming someone else, but the dark men had still caught up with him. Why they would wipe out an entire family simply to get their hands on an expat who liked to cook made no sense to Sean, but few things about Nathan did.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sean.\u201d Eugene, one of his regular customers, strode in through the shop door. \u201cWhere you been, you lazy bastard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJob across town.\u201d Sean stood up and shook hands. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to order some parts.\u201d He bent sideways to look at the bike. \u201cIs that a Ducati Monster?\u201d He whistled. \u201cTires are fucked. What\u2019d the owner do, get spiked?\u201d</p><p>Eugene had a couple of motorcycles he was perennially working on, and Sean didn\u2019t mind asking for a consult. \u201cCollision in an alley. You ever seen two tires blow at the same time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf they were spiked, yeah. Or maybe some shitty retreads.\u201d Eugene crouched down to finger the split in the rear tire. \u201cThis don\u2019t look right. See how the rubber is peeling outward? This bitch blew fast and hard.\u201d He stood up and walked over to look at the front tire. \u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverfilled?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you filled \u2019em with cement or something.\u201d He scratched his head. \u201cThis is some fucking weird shit happening here, my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting two new tires on it.\u201d Sean made a mental note to order them from his supplier. \u201cCome in the office and I\u2019ll write your parts.\u201d</p><p>Eugene glanced back a few times as they crossed the bay. \u201cHey, can I have the old tires off that bike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? Bookends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to show \u2019em to a friend of mine,\u201d Eugene said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a junkyard, and collects spooky shit. He\u2019s got this eight-track he pulled out of a wrecked van that went over a bridge, killed a bunch of kids back in the seventies. It\u2019s got a tape stuck in it, but when you turn it on it only plays \u2018Free Bird.\u2019 Creeps me out.\u201d</p><p>Sean chuckled. \u201cSure, you can have \u2019em if you haul \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Eugene took a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s talk carburetors.\u201d</p><p>The view from Gerald King\u2019s bedroom window never changed. From his position on the top floor of one of the last freestanding mansions in Manhattan, he could see the streets below, the river beyond, and in the distance a vague smear of New Jersey skyline against the twilight sky.</p><p>During the spring and summer he seldom looked out, indifferent to the city\u2019s myriad celebrations of warmer temperatures and better business. Only when the fall began leeching the green from the trees and the people from the streets did he come to admire the view. As winter finally arrived with its bitter winds and gray snows, the city became like the landscape of his soul: empty, desolate, an ancient Titan chained for eternity to the rocks of existence, feeding on poison daily just to stay alive.</p><p>If he had been a man who prayed, he would have made a single request of God\u2014that he be given a second chance at life with the only thing he had ever loved. And she was here, in the city, perhaps even now just around the corner. Just out of his sight.</p><p>What was she doing? Walking the streets? Watching faces? Looking for his? After all this time, did she still think of him? Or had she made herself forget him?</p><p>She could do that, and more. With her powers she could make dreams come true. He had seen it with his own eyes; touched the proof of it with his own hands. And now she was out there, lost and alone, hiding herself among the herd of common humanity, who should have been gathering around to fall on their knees to worship her like the goddess she was.</p><p>The knowledge that she lived made him feel young again. It also made him aware of every tick of the clock on his mantel, every shadow shifted by the passage of the sun.</p><p>\u201cMr. King.\u201d</p><p>Gerald kept his staff on a ruthless schedule designed to keep his contact with them to a bare minimum. The interruption now, however, could not be avoided\u2014not when he was so close to finding her. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have an electronic message from Atlanta, sir.\u201d The communications technician remained standing just beyond the threshold. \u201cThe transmission came through flagged as urgent and encrypted for eyes-only.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That meant only King could open the message. \u201cUpload it to my system and then destroy the original transmission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The technician withdrew.</p><p>No one had access to King\u2019s private computer array; he kept it completely isolated from the rest of the household terminals as well as the networks used by his various business interests. A subterminal system allowed one-way communication between the household system by accepting uploads, which were then vigorously screened and sanitized before a second upload to the private mainframe. Nothing on King\u2019s system could be downloaded or copied; any attempt to do so would initiate a terminus protocol that would destroy King\u2019s computer as well as every computer that had ever uploaded anything to the subterminal.</p> <p>It took time for the subterminal to scan, study, and clean the upload before it was forwarded. King used the time to engage his privacy measures, which isolated and secured his living space from the rest of the house and generated an electronic signal that would scramble any listening device within five hundred yards.</p><p>He glanced at his terminal, where the words upload completed appeared. \u201cOpen most recent encrypted file, password silence-one-one-two-seven-one-nine-five-six-rebirth.\u201d</p><p>The terminal\u2019s voice recognition software responded not only to the spoken code but to King\u2019s voice itself, which it instantly compared with the voice print kept on file. Because the voice matched, it accepted the code; if anyone else had tried to use it the result would have been initiation of the terminus protocol.</p><p>\u201cAudio file opened,\u201d the system\u2019s computerized voice told him. \u201cHold, replay, save, or delete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReplay.\u201d</p> <p>A moment later, a familiar voice came through the system\u2019s speakers. \u201cMr. King, the partial DNA sample taken from the female prime has been used to resolve the problem with the transerum. Mr. Genaro is now aware of the value of the female and has determined that she is presently in New York City.\u201d</p><p>Pain lanced through his head and for a moment split his vision in two before he reached for his phone.</p><p>King had obtained much of his communications equipment from various agencies involved in high-tech surveillance and other covert operations. The satellite phone he used to place the call was one of only three in existence; it could not be monitored and any call he made on it could not be traced to the line he called or back to his residence.</p><p>The voice that answered was as void of emotion as its owner. \u201cYes, Mr. King.\u201d</p><p>He had to unclench his teeth in order to speak. \u201cHow did Genaro find out she\u2019s in the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been unable to determine that, sir,\u201d his operative said, \u201cbut I believe he\u2019s using some unconventional means to locate them.\u201d</p> <p>Them. As if King cared about anyone but her. But if Genaro had developed some new technology that could track her . . . \u201cWhat could he use?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheoretically speaking, a government spy satellite could be programmed to search for them. They all have unique energy signatures that register off the grid. But I don\u2019t think he has enough information gathered to correctly identify a targeted individual.\u201d The operative paused. \u201cHe may be using one of them to locate the others. We\u2019ve yet to identify a remote viewer, but it\u2019s certainly not beyond the scope of their abilities.\u201d</p><p>King closed his eyes, forcing the pain back. \u201cYou told me he was killing everyone he captured in order to harvest their DNA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is what we\u2019ve been told,\u201d his operative agreed, \u201cand what the records show.\u201d</p><p>The chairman of GenHance had many secrets; it would be nothing for him to deceive even his most trusted employees. \u201cWhat action is being taken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA team of trackers has been dispatched to recover her,\u201d was the reply. \u201cThey will arrive within the next twelve hours.\u201d</p><p>Genaro\u2019s efficiency and decisiveness remained unchanged, but this time he was sending his men into King\u2019s territory. \u201cSend complete profiles and photographs for each member of the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re being transmitted to you as we speak.\u201d</p> <p>King heard a faint rushing sound in his ears, as if sand was pouring out of them. \u201cHas Genaro tested the modified transerum on a living human subject yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>Genaro\u2019s uncharacteristic hesitancy gave King a slight advantage, one he would use to eradicate his wealthy rival in Atlanta. \u201cContinue monitoring the situation. When the transerum is tested, report back to me at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>King ended the call and left his bedroom, moving through a short passage and through a door no one but he was allowed to enter. Inside the smaller room the air was much cooler and drier, but still scented with the faintest trace of lily-of-the valley.</p><p>He went, as he always did, to her pristine bed, where snow-white Belgian lace cascaded from a gracefully arched canopy to veil the cream linens. They lay pushed aside, as if someone had just risen from the bed. The right pillow still held a slight indentation, and draped on the end of the mattress lay a long robe of pale pink satin.</p><p>He reached out a shaking hand, reverently touching the depression in the pillow as he thought of the many nights he had come to this bed and found the ultimate pleasure in her arms. She had been so sweet and trusting, and while she had never truly understood his passion, she had accepted it. Her love had indulged his every desire, giving him all that he had asked of her, refusing him nothing.</p><p>That selflessness, that unstinting generosity\u2014that was true love.</p><p>King turned slowly toward the painting hanging on the south wall. He had commissioned her portrait just before she had come to him, and the world- renowned artist had captured every nuance of her being: the pale gold of her hair, the exquisite whiteness of her skin. Her eyes, large and beautifully blue, looked down at him, shining from within. All the love she had brought into his life he saw in her gentle smile, her thin hands.</p><p>He could not bear to look upon her for more than a few moments; so great was his grief that he turned and moved to her little vanity table. The dainty pearl necklace that she had set out to wear that day curled beside the ivory brush and hand mirror she had used that last night. Some strands of her hair remained caught in the bristles of the brush, and when he brought it to his face he could smell her sweetness and goodness.</p><p>Carefully he set down the brush exactly where it had been in the thick layer of dust that he never noticed. When he glanced in the curved mirror, he saw only his own eyes, dark with the pain he bore, wet with the tears he refused to shed.</p><p>\u201cSoon we\u2019ll be together again, Alana,\u201d he murmured. \u201cVery soon, my love.\u201d</p><p>PART TWO</p><p>Chasse</p><p>MISSING PERSON/RUNAWAY REPORT</p><p>Manhattan Police Department</p><p>100 Centre Street</p><p>New York, NY 10013</p><p>Case #: J5720</p><p>Incident Location: King Estate, 371 Riverside Drive, Manhattan (at 109th St.)</p><p>Date: September 29, 2008</p><p>Missing Person Information</p><p>Name: Alana King</p><p>DOB: 11-7-92</p><p>Age at Disappearance: 16 years</p><p>Race: W Sex: F Height: 5\u20194\u201d Weight: 105 lbs.</p><p>Hair color: Blond Hair Style/Length: Straight, shoulder-length Eye Color: Blue Complexion: Fair Build: Thin</p><p>Medical, Mental, and Physical Condition: Physically frail; mentally incapacitated and medication-dependent (See attached psychiatric profile)</p><p>Prior Medical History: Various surgeries to correct birth defects (See attached medical records)</p><p>Birthmarks/Other Identifying Marks: Tattoos on both inner forearms (See attached photo)</p><p>Piercings: None</p><p>Teeth: (See attached dental records)</p><p>Clothing worn at time of disappearance: Blue jeans, white T-shirt, brown cloth jacket, brown wool skullcap, brown scarf</p><p>Jewelry: None</p><p>Employer/Work/School: None/None/Home Tutored</p><p>Circumstances of the Disappearance: On the evening of September 28, 2008, the estate security system was deactivated due to equipment failure.

Patterson Jr.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>The kitchen staff began to arrive for work at D\u2019Anges while Rowan was sorting out and shelving the dry goods that had been delivered. As they came in, each one of the line cooks eyed her apron and then her face, but no one came over to her, said hello, or otherwise acknowledged her presence. Instead they went to their stations around the kitchen and began preparing for their shift, talking to each other in low tones and occasionally giving her a quick look.</p><p>She didn\u2019t scowl back at them, but she didn\u2019t bother to paste a friendly look on her face, either. She knew enough about chefs and cooks from reading books about them and the service industry to recognize that as a new hire she had yet to prove herself, and until she did she would be treated as an unwelcome outsider.</p><p>Rowan also saw that she was the only woman in the kitchen\u2014Dansant\u2019s staff was apparently all male\u2014which obviously wouldn\u2019t help matters.</p><p>The shortest guy on the crew finally came over to speak with her. He was a burly, balding Italian who looked like he busted kneecaps on his days off. \u201cYou got a name, kid?\u201d</p><p>She placed the last bag of rye flour on the shelf. \u201cRowan Dietrich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Lonzo.\u201d He didn\u2019t offer a hand, but turned and started pointing to the others. \u201cThat\u2019s Manny, George, Vince, and Lou. Dishwasher\u2019s Enrique, but he don\u2019t speak English too good. Bernard\u2019s the sous-chef, but he\u2019s late again.\u201d He gave her the once-over. \u201cWhy\u2019d Dansant hire you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t think saying I crashed my bike into his sous-chef\u2019s Volvo would go over well. \u201cI needed the job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe walk you through the place, show you the stations?\u201d When she nodded, he did the same. \u201cAll right, Trick, you\u2019re my tournant tonight. Do what I tell you, don\u2019t fuck up, and we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d</p><p>It was not the warmest reception in the world, but it was a fair one, and she\u2019d rather be called Trick than kid any day. \u201cThank you, Chef.\u201d</p> <p>Rowan expected some form of initiation or other trial by fire, and wasn\u2019t disappointed when Lonzo took her to a big, sunken table at the back of the kitchen, handed her a six-inch flexible blade with a slight curve, and got her started on her first task. That was where Dansant found her thirty minutes later, up to her elbows in fish innards and slime as she worked her way through gutting and cleaning fifty pounds of striped bass.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She finished trimming a fin before she spared him a glance. \u201cYou need me to explain this procedure to you, Chef?\u201d</p><p>He made an impatient sound. \u201cI meant, why are you doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy. Your idiot supplier doesn\u2019t clean them.\u201d She made a slit in the carcass\u2019s belly skin, extending it from the anus to the gills. \u201cAlso, if I don\u2019t do this, Lonzo will kick my skinny ass.\u201d</p> <p>Dansant scowled. \u201cHe will do no such thing.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head toward the front of the kitchen. \u201cHey, Chef,\u201d she yelled, \u201cwhat\u2019ll you do if I stop cleaning this fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kick your skinny ass,\u201d Lonzo shouted back.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Rowan reached inside the carcass, felt for the spot where the guts were all connected at the base of the head, and stripped out the lot. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t your supplier clean these guys out first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe purchases them from a fish farm, and brings them into the city in tanks. That way he can keep them alive until it is time to deliver,\u201d Dansant told her. \u201cI prefer to have them cleaned by my cooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFarmed, tanked fish.\u201d She shook her head, amused.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t go, but watched her scrape out the bass\u2019s liver and slice away the remains of its swim bladder. \u201cYou have done this before tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019m good with knives, and you guys only have to show me how to do something once for me to get it.\u201d She also sensed their conversation had drawn the attention of the other chefs, which made her shoulders itch. She didn\u2019t want to be seen as receiving any kind of coddling or special treatment from Dansant. That would turn the staff\u2019s wariness and suspicions into resentment and contempt. \u201cIs there something else you need me to do, Chef?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He studied her face. \u201cAdd some ice to the bath\u201d\u2014he nodded toward the basin of water in which she\u2019d placed the cleaned fish\u2014\u201cor the warmth of the water will leech out the flavor.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, Rowan nodded and quick-scrubbed her hands at the sink before grabbing a scoop and hurrying to the ice machine.</p><p>A second after she had dropped the last fish into the ice water, Lonzo called her over to one of the prep tables, where a basket of brown, wrinkly morels and a huge colander of bright green pea pods sat beside a smaller, cloth-swaddled wooden box.</p><p>\u201cAfter we do the chicken you\u2019re gonna shell those peas,\u201d he told her as he began unwrapping the box. She picked up the colander to take it to the rinsing table as he lifted the lid to reveal a dozen ugly black lumps nested like charred eggs in what appeared to be an airtight inner container. He caught her staring and took out one of the largest to hold it in front of her face. \u201cYou know what this is?\u201d</p><p>She tried not to breathe in the intoxicating fragrance, but it was too close to her nose to resist. It smelled of the earth and rain, with just the slightest hint of hazelnuts. \u201cIt\u2019s a truffle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a P\u00e9rigord black truffle.\u201d He turned it over in his hand as gently as if he were holding a newborn baby chick. \u201cTwenty years ago you could only get these from Europe. The French exported them, but it would take a week or better, and what they sent was too small or old.\u201d Lonzo made a nasty sound. \u201cGreedy bastards kept all the best ones for themselves.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d read about these rarest and most prized of cooking fungi in books, but at prices that rose as high as sixteen hundred dollars a pound, she\u2019d never had the money to buy even a dinky one. \u201cAre they really that good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re the reason I go to the church on Sunday,\u201d Lonzo said flatly, \u201cand thank God that He loves us so much.\u201d He removed a very thin, honed knife from the roll of black cloth beside the cutting board. \u201cNow we got trufflieres that grow them right here, in America. Things go right, in a few years we\u2019re gonna have all the black diamonds we want,\u201d he added, using the fungus\u2019s extravagant nickname.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to wash the diamonds?\u201d Rowan asked, and watched Lonzo yank the truffle back as if she had tried to spit on it. Dansant came over to the station and selected three more of the black tubers out of the box. \u201cOr maybe I could just watch.\u201d She was curious to see her new boss at work.</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t got time.\u201d Lonzo stepped between them and dumped into her arms several perforated plastic bags containing fresh rosemary, thyme, and mint. \u201cRinse the herbs, check them for black spots, and then take them to George\u2019s station.\u201d</p><p>Over Lonzo\u2019s shoulder, Dansant gave her a wink. Suppressing a chuckle, Rowan took the bags back to the rinsing sink.</p><p>Although she stayed busy, Rowan was able to turn slightly and observe Dansant working with Lonzo. After delicately wiping clean his precious truffles, the garde-manger handed them to Dansant, who sliced them into perfectly even, wafer-thin rounds while Lonzo began lining up several untrussed chickens to one side of the cutting board. Once he had sliced enough rounds, Dansant loosened the skin of one chicken from the neck opening all the way across the breast, and then did the same for the legs.</p><p>Rowan caught herself holding her breath as Dansant began deftly slipping one at a time the thin rounds of sliced truffle under the skin. His long, elegant fingers worked them in place, until most of each thigh and the breast were covered with the aromatic fungus. Once he had finished, he used kitchen string to bind the ends of the legs before crisscrossing it over the breast and under the back.</p><p>By the time Rowan had delivered the cleaned herbs to George\u2019s station, Lonzo called her over to tell her to carry the truffled chickens, now plastic-wrapped, back to the meat refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t these go over to the r\u00f4tisseur?\u201d she asked as she stood holding the tray while Lonzo unloaded them onto the shelves.</p><p>\u201cVince will roast them tomorrow night.\u201d For every package of chicken he put into the fridge, he took out another and placed it on the tray. Then Manny yelled for him, and he cursed under his breath before trotting off.</p><p>\u201cThe truffles must have a day to infuse the meat with their magic,\u201d Dansant said right behind her, making her nearly drop the heavy tray. He came around and supported it from the other side. \u201cThese are the chickens we stuffed last night.\u201d He peeled away some of the wrap and pulled back the breast skin, enough for her to see how the truffle had darkened the meat.</p><p>\u201cPoulet demi-deuil must be real popular,\u201d she said, looking up at him. Tonight all the lights were on in the kitchen, and made his eyes look so dazzling a blue that Rowan almost let the tray slip a second time. \u201cTo make it every night. Do you? Put it on the menu every night?\u201d In some corner of her head she knew she was babbling, but she couldn\u2019t stop looking at him. Gay or not, he seemed to become more beautiful to her with every slam of her heart in her chest.</p><p>\u201cIt is a house specialty.\u201d He moved his hands around the edge of the tray until his fingers slid over hers. \u201cTell me what you are thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I do that?\u201d she heard herself ask in a strange, hollow voice.</p><p>He bent his head until his breath cooled her damp scalp. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t you, ma m\u00fbre?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrick.\u201d Lonzo\u2019s bellow jerked her back to herself just as she felt her eyes sting. \u201cYou go deaf or something? Vince is waiting for the tray. Bring it over, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight away, Chef.\u201d She ducked her head, ashamed for making such a transparent ass out of herself in front of the rest of the staff, and hurried off.</p><p>Taire heard the guys in the kitchen calling her Trick, and smirked a little. If Rowan thought they were doing it because they liked her, the trick was on her.</p><p>She went to her usual spot, a recessed doorway hidden in the shadows, and sat down on the cold slate stoop. From there she watched the comings and goings, although the only person she saw was Rowan going on garbage runs. She passed the time by counting the number of times the other girl emerged from the back doorway carrying two or three overstuffed black bags, which she trotted over to the restaurant\u2019s fenced-in Dumpster. At first she tossed them in like they were filled with feathers, but as the night stretched out, her tossing became heaving and a couple of times she groaned and rubbed her arm before trudging back in.</p><p>Taire felt a twinge of sympathy. The guys in the kitchen weren\u2019t as nice as the Frenchman, and they didn\u2019t like women. Sometimes on other nights she had listened to a couple of them joking while they stood out in the alley on a smoke break. They considered women good for only two things: folding napkins and fucking. No doubt they were going to make Rowan suffer as much as they could. Men loved it when women cried and quit.</p><p>Father hadn\u2019t been as crude or mean, but what he had expected of her had been just as harsh. If it were easy, my dear, anyone would do.</p><p>She pushed her father from her thoughts and looked down each side of the alley. Sometimes bums came to rifle through the garbage bags. There would be plenty of scraps in them, good food from unfinished meals, and even the stink from the older garbage under them didn\u2019t drive off the bums. No matter how hungry she was, Taire knew better than to rummage around a Dumpster. If Rowan or one of the guys from the restaurant didn\u2019t catch her, the rats that were already gnawing their way into the bags would. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rowan made another run, and this time Taire had to press her arms around her waist to muffle the gurgle of her stomach. Being hungry sucked\u2014and she was always hungry\u2014but sitting there and breathing in the delicious scents that came rolling out along with Rowan made it worse.</p><p>It was Taire\u2019s own fault; she\u2019d had all day to sneak out and get more food for her stash. She had enough change for a coffee, and the girl at the doughnut place where Taire usually went almost always slipped her a muffin or something for free. But thinking and dreaming and worrying had led to planning, and she\u2019d paced her room all afternoon while she worked it out different ways in her head and then immediately shot down each one: I could write her a letter (but all she had was hotel stationery). I could call her on the restaurant\u2019s phone (but the call might be traced). I could ask one of the kids to give her a message (and the same kid could go to the cops). I could break into her apartment upstairs (but she didn\u2019t know how to pick locks, and anything else she might try would look like a burglary).</p><p>All that, and still no plan. She was too afraid to do anything, and would be until she knew for sure she wouldn\u2019t be caught.</p> <p>Taire didn\u2019t know what Rowan could do, or what she might do to her after she told her. Rowan had to be stronger; not even crashing her bike had really hurt her. And what if she was just as scared as Taire was? She might attack her.</p><p>Her head whirled a little as she pushed herself up. Her hunger burned in her, worse than it ever had been; if she wasn\u2019t careful she might pass out and be found. They\u2019d call the police, or an ambulance. They\u2019d take her to a hospital or a shelter. They\u2019d find out who she was, and then they\u2019d kill her.</p><p>Or worse, they wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>The back door flung open, but Taire didn\u2019t realize she was standing in the light until Rowan turned and looked directly at her. She staggered back into the shadows, but it was too late.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Rowan set down the garbage bags by the curb and squinted at her. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d</p> <p>In her head Taire was running away, but her legs shook too much for that. She crouched down and huddled over, holding her breath, hoping the other girl would think she was only seeing things.</p><p>\u201cHey, kid.\u201d Rowan took a few steps toward her. \u201cYou need some help?\u201d</p><p>Taire felt the slate under her heels shift, and pressed her lips together to keep from shrieking. Yes! Help me! Save me! No! Stay away!</p><p>\u201cWait a second, okay?\u201d Rowan went back into the kitchen.</p><p>Now was her chance to get up and out of here. Taire made it as far as the next door when she heard a familiar trotting step and glanced over her shoulder.</p><p>Rowan stopped a few feet away. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, kid.\u201d In her hands was a large black plastic container with a clear top. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d</p> <p>Taire could smell it now. Roasted chicken, herbs, potatoes, onions. Something more exotic and savory. She turned around, staring at the container\u2014it was stuffed with food\u2014and the red and silver can in Rowan\u2019s other hand.</p><p>A Coke. She\u2019d brought her food and a Coke. For nothing.</p><p>Rowan didn\u2019t come at her, but held out her arms, putting the container and the can as far out as she could. \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d When Taire didn\u2019t move, she crouched and carefully put it on the ground, then stood and moved back. \u201cTake it.\u201d</p><p>Taire shuffled forward, keeping one eye on the food and the other on Rowan. Anticipation was making her feel sick now, her belly shrinking in on itself, her chest tight, her throat a vise. At the same time the smell of it had her mouth watering so bad she was practically drooling. She hadn\u2019t eaten real food in weeks.</p><p>Jesus. She hadn\u2019t had a Coke since she\u2019d left home.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Rowan urged.</p><p>Taire snatched the container and the soda up from the ground. The alley tilted, and she choked back a liquid sound as her stomach heaved. She had to say something, but all she could do was hold the food tight against her so no one would take it back. It was hers now. Rowan had put it on the ground. That made it hers.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s your name?\u201d Rowan asked, still peering as if trying to see her face.</p> <p>Terror forced Taire to trip backward, spinning and clutching the container as she fled. She dodged around the corner and cut through two more streets, not looking back or hearing anything but the ferocious slam of her heart in her ears.</p><p>Finally she found a spot between two parked cars, slipped into it and crouched down. She had to hold her breath and press the cold soda can against one ear before the pounding ebbed and she could hear again.</p><p>Nothing. No running footsteps, no calling voice. Taire waited to be sure, but after several minutes she knew Rowan hadn\u2019t followed her.</p><p>She set down the soda can carefully before she tore off the top of the container and grabbed a small whole potato speckled with flecks of herbs. She shoved the entire thing in her mouth, her eyes leaking thin tears as the alien sensation of having her mouth full nearly choked her.</p><p>Slow down slow down slow down.</p><p>Taire took the potato out of her mouth and instead held it like an apple so she could take a small bite. The taste was silky and buttery and flavored with thyme and rosemary, and she wanted to gobble the whole thing again. It took all her willpower to hold back and nibble away at it in small bites.</p><p>The chicken was even better. She lifted a golden-brown drumstick from the container and smelled it before sinking her teeth into the fragrant, juicy meat. Something soft and dark and thin under the skin came with it, and expanded in a dark, rich cloud of flavor inside her mouth. The taste was so warm and wonderful she moaned.</p><p>Oh God that\u2019s so good.</p><p>If she didn\u2019t stop stuffing her face so fast it was all going to come back up, Taire knew, from the shock of so much rich, solid food on the bottomless pit of her belly. Because she had no way to keep it she\u2019d have to eat everything tonight, but it didn\u2019t have to be here or all at once. She could spend the rest of the night savoring the meal.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t wait for a taste of the Coke, though, and tapped the top of the soda can before she opened it and took a little sip. It was so cold and sweet it made her teeth ache, and a little slopped over the edge as her hand shook. As she sipped at the spillage from the rim, she tasted a trace of something else that wasn\u2019t as sweet, something tart and dry that took her back to the night before, when she\u2019d watched Rowan take on the young tagger. When she\u2019d seen the blue glow beneath the other girl\u2019s sleeve. She hadn\u2019t remembered every detail before, maybe because it had been another shock, like eating this food, to have so much within reach after having lived with nothing for so long. . . .</p><p>I\u2019m the Coke and she\u2019s the Cristal.</p><p>Taire laughed as soundlessly as she cried.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>After her first night working at D\u2019Anges, Rowan dragged herself upstairs, stripped to the skin as she staggered to her futon, and fell face- first onto the cushions. She was asleep as soon as she closed her eyes, and stayed that way until her stomach and her bladder combined forces to drive her out of bed.</p><p>Bathroom. Food. Bathroom first.</p><p>She trudged naked in that direction, then stopped and remembered the shared facilities. \u201cGod damn it.\u201d She pulled on a T-shirt and a pair of jeans before unlocking the door.</p><p>The landing was empty, no light showed under the edge of Meriden\u2019s door, and the bathroom door stood slightly open, so she figured she was alone.</p><p>She found out she was wrong as soon as she walked inside.</p><p>Sean Meriden, dressed only in a pair of jeans, stood over the sink. He used his razor to remove a strip of white foam from his mostly shaved face before he eyed her in the cabinet mirror. He smelled of soap and menthol and heat, and there were tiny beads of water scattered over the short gilded stubble covering his scalp and the smooth muscles of his back. The pale light from the small window illuminated them, making him look as if he\u2019d been crystallized.</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d Normally she would take a moment to admire all the bare, sparkling man in her face, but if she didn\u2019t soon pee her first task of the day would be mopping up a puddle. \u201cYou almost done?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word. She waited, but he simply finished shaving and cleaned his razor under the tap.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She did an about-face to head downstairs. The kitchen had a small half-bathroom for the line cooks to use; that would have to do. Maybe she\u2019d grab something from the pantry; she was so hungry Meriden\u2019s massive biceps was starting to look tasty.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s five thirty.\u201d</p><p>She turned around, surprised and confused. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>He dried off the bottom of his face with a hand towel, and then looked in the mirror and touched a small bloody spot on his jaw where he\u2019d cut himself shaving. \u201cYou said you wanted the bathroom at two and between ten and eleven.\u201d He pressed an edge of the towel over the cut. \u201cIt\u2019s five thirty.\u201d</p><p>Well, at least he\u2019d listened to her yesterday. And what the hell was she doing up so early? She hadn\u2019t finished work until well after Dansant had left at midnight. \u201cUh, right. I didn\u2019t look at the time. Sorry.\u201d Something occurred to her, and she swung back around. \u201cYou do mean it\u2019s five thirty in the morning, right?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d She\u2019d slept through the entire night and day, and she had only thirty minutes before her next shift began. \u201cYou\u2019re not planning to do anything like soak in the tub for the next hour, are you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, and it was a beautiful, evil thing to behold. \u201cI might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave some room for me, then.\u201d She turned and dashed downstairs.</p><p>Once she\u2019d eliminated the risk of puddle making, Rowan ran to the pantry and quickly scanned the shelves. She needed lots of calories she could eat fast, and appropriated several bars of dark sweet baking chocolate and a can of condensed milk. She paused long enough to open and empty the thickened milk into a glass with ice, and then rushed back upstairs.</p><p>Meriden wasn\u2019t in the bathroom, so she detoured to get her soap and a towel before running in to turn on the shower and strip. At the same time, she tore open one of the bars of chocolate and crammed half of it into her mouth, chewing in between gulps of the cooled milk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In the shower she ate the rest of the chocolate bar from one hand while she used the other to soap herself from head to toe before she rinsed off. Just as she was wiping the water from her eyes and reached for the tap, she heard the door open.</p><p>Shit, she\u2019d forgotten to lock it. \u201cAlmost done,\u201d she called out desperately.</p><p>Meriden cast a big shadow on the other side of the curtain. \u201cHow did you blow both tires on the bike?\u201d</p> <p>This was not the conversation she wanted to have while she was standing naked and dripping wet with a paper-thin piece of opaque plastic between them. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Something hit me from behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fucked.\u201d</p><p>So was she. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ordered new.\u201d He made it sound as if he\u2019d paid for them in blood.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Could she reach for her towel without flashing him? Probably not. \u201cLet me get dressed and then we\u2019ll go over\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother.\u201d His voice sounded odd. \u201cI\u2019m outta here.\u201d And then he was.</p><p>Rowan peeked around the edge of the curtain to be sure, then stepped out and dried off with two swipes. Her damp body made it harder to get back into her clothes, but she was nothing if not determined.</p><p>Once she\u2019d covered everything she didn\u2019t want him ogling, she stepped out onto the landing. Meriden wasn\u2019t there, so she knocked on his door and waited, rubbing the towel over her wet curls. He didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cSnotty bastard.\u201d She stomped back into the bathroom, collected her stuff and went into her apartment. She had meant to go shopping today for supplies, but she\u2019d blown that. She ate the rest of the chocolate she\u2019d filched from the pantry to quiet her belly and chugged the last of the iced condensed milk, wishing for coffee but not daring to spare the time to make it. By the time her watch read 5:55 p.m., she had made herself presentable and went downstairs.</p><p>Lonzo was waiting for her. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>Maybe Dansant hadn\u2019t told him what her working hours were. \u201cI start at six.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not fifteen minutes early,\u201d he told her with a stab of his finger at the wall clock, \u201cyou\u2019re late.\u201d</p><p>From the depth of his scowl Lonzo was clearly in a bad mood. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Chef. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d She glanced around. \u201cDid you see Meriden\u2014uh, the other tenant who lives upstairs\u2014come down and leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I, your fucking doorman?\u201d He made a rude gesture. \u201cWe got a truck waiting outside and five meez to restock. Get your ass out there and start unloading.\u201d</p><p>Rowan started for the back door.</p><p>\u201cTrick.\u201d When she turned, Lonzo tossed an apron at her. \u201cThis is your uniform. I see you outta uniform again, you\u2019re cleaning squid for a week.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d probably be cleaning squid for a week anyway. \u201cUnderstood, Chef.\u201d</p><p>The delivery truck\u2019s driver was only slightly less annoyed with her than Lonzo, but Rowan kept her mouth shut, her head down, and unloaded the boxes marked for D\u2019Anges. By the time she stowed the last one inside, another truck rolled up. While she was unloading that one, the line cooks started arriving. No one offered to help, but Rowan knew better than to ask. Vince, the r\u00f4tisseur, stayed outside the back door to smoke a cigarette and watch.</p><p>Of all the line cooks, Vince was the one Rowan liked least. He was a few inches shorter than her and about a hundred pounds heavier, with wiry strawberry-blond hair and a pudgy face. Rosacea bloomed like heat rash on his chin and cheeks, and a network of broken capillaries around his nostrils attested to a serious drinking problem. He had light brown eyes nested in the puffy bags and deep wrinkles of a much older man. He\u2019d visited the kitchen john several times the night before, and from the used-ashtray smell of his whites she guessed he\u2019d gone in to sneak a smoke.</p> <p>Vince had a wheezing, high-pitched voice like a washed-up boxer who had gotten punched in the nose and throat too many times, and when he spoke to her it was mainly in the direction of her tits. \u201cYou enjoying the new job, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove it.\u201d Rowan counted the boxes before she checked the driver\u2019s invoice and signed off on it. She bent to pick up a box, and straightened into a cloud of smoke. He\u2019d shifted a little so he could blow it in her face, but she\u2019d be damned if she\u2019d let out a single cough. \u201cThose things will kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat or the whiskey,\u201d he agreed. He squinted again at her chest, his lips pursed as if he were judging it for a boobs contest. \u201cDanz gave you a place upstairs, I heard.\u201d</p><p>She started to carry the box inside, but he barred the door with one beefy arm. The box dragged at her arms, and if she ducked under she\u2019d drop it. \u201cYeah. He did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou getting lonely up there, by yourself?\u201d He showed her his crooked, nicotine-yellowed teeth. \u201cMaybe you want a little company later?\u201d</p><p>Telling him she was a lesbian would probably just turn him on. \u201cI got company, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? Who? Not Danz,\u201d he said, answering himself. \u201cHe don\u2019t exactly go for the ladies, know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuy across the hall does.\u201d She leaned into his envelope of smoke. \u201cAbout six-six, two-fifty, works on bikes and cars. You know him?\u201d</p><p>Vince cleared his throat. \u201cThe Irishman. Sure, I seen that guy.\u201d He tried to curl his lip. \u201cNot really your type, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you shouldn\u2019t listen to your girlfriends.\u201d She let her gaze drift down and then back up. \u201cSize does matter.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his arm, and she carried the box in. Lonzo was standing just inside, but now he wasn\u2019t glowering. He was looking at her as if she\u2019d just grown another head.</p><p>Here we go, Rowan thought, kissing her job good-bye.</p><p>\u201cVince,\u201d he yelled, not looking away from her face. \u201cDrop that butt and start getting them boxes in here.\u201d</p><p>All Vince said in return was a remarkably meek \u201cYes, Chef.\u201d</p><p>Meriden stopped at the first pay phone he found and called the number Gerald King had given him to use to make his daily report.</p><p>\u201cI went to the coffee shop where Alana was spotted,\u201d he told the old man as soon as he answered. \u201cThe girl who served her thought she might be in trouble. From her general description of your daughter it sounds as if she\u2019s living on the street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat girl is not my daughter,\u201d King told him. \u201cShe is remembering the wrong person. Go back and question her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe girl she served matches Alana\u2019s physical description\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo does every blond, blue-eyed girl in the city,\u201d the old man snapped. \u201cAlana is not living on the street. Nor would she go out or wander around the streets during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is she a werewolf?\u201d</p><p>King produced a dry, hacking laugh. \u201cNo, Mr. Meriden, she is most certainly not. Didn\u2019t you read the file I provided for you? Wherever she is, Alana will need constant access to food. Check the grocery stores, the delis, the hot dog stands, and anywhere one can buy food cheaply and quickly.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me your daughter has an eating disorder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t. Alana has an unusual metabolism combined with a digestive problem,\u201d King said. \u201cShe has to eat many times a day or she begins rapidly losing weight.\u201d</p><p>This might be the lead he needed. \u201cIs she on any medication for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Her condition is untreatable.\u201d King covered a cough before he added, \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to interview the man who called in the sighting,\u201d Meriden told him. \u201cHe may have noticed more than he told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe transcripts from his interview are also in the file,\u201d King said. \u201cHe told me everything he remembered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather interview him again and be sure.\u201d</p><p>The old man sighed. \u201cAlas, that is no longer possible. Mr. Sengali is deceased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed him?\u201d Meriden\u2019s skin crawled. \u201cAre you crazy? He was the only person who\u2019s seen your daughter in a year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Sengali neglected to tell me that he had a weak heart. After questioning, he had a heart attack and died of natural causes.\u201d King\u2019s tone hardened. \u201cThat needn\u2019t concern you, Mr. Meriden. You have a young, strong heart, and three weeks to ensure that it will keep beating long after our business is concluded.\u201d He hung up.</p><p>Meriden slammed the receiver down, cracking the plastic earpiece in the process. \u201cYou stupid shit son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>The last rays of the sun filtered through the maze of Manhattan\u2019s skyscrapers and glittered on the icy waters of the Hudson. He should have gone back to his apartment, but Meriden drove instead to a new building, and swiped a plastic security card at the gate to the underground garage. He parked his car in the empty space marked PH-1 and used a key to enter the elevator.</p><p>The condominium had been built to provide accommodations for the city\u2019s up-and-coming power brokers, and was as high-tech and sterile as their offices in the financial district. As the lift whisked him up to the top floor, he clenched his keys in his fist, not feeling the sharp edges cutting into his palm.</p><p>King was being too open and unguarded; he\u2019d already given him enough information to destroy the old man\u2019s life. At first Meriden thought it was because King was dying, but now he wasn\u2019t so sure. Whatever happened to King in three weeks, whether Meriden found Alana or not, the old man now couldn\u2019t afford to let him live.</p><p>Dansant owned the top two floors of the building, but only used the apartment with the best view of the Upper West Side. Meriden used another key to let himself in. Dansant knew Meriden had duped all of his keys and cards without asking, but he had never altered his codes or changed the locks. As he walked into the spacious front room, he felt a surge of envy and hatred that hadn\u2019t diminished since the first time he\u2019d seen the place.</p><p>Rather than compartmentalize the three-thousand-square-foot apartment into separate rooms, Dansant\u2019s army of interior designers had knocked down most of the walls and replaced them with floor-to-ceiling panels of clear and translucent glass. The effect allowed anyone standing in any corner of the apartment to see most of the interior simply by turning their head. Enormous sheets of smooth, camel-colored limestone covered the floors, and the twelve- foot exterior walls were painted a matte cream that had been faintly textured to absorb light rather than reflect it. The effect was something like standing in a cloud. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Unconventional furnishings and fabrics graced each room, from the imported ivory silk carpets from China to the low-slung sofas and chairs designed to flow like ribbons fluttering in the wind. The only colors used were muted earth and sky tones, which faded away into the cloudlike walls as if they were in the process of disappearing into them.</p><p>Meriden despised clutter, and he might have warmed to the place himself if not for the dozens of portraits hung on the walls, each one a slam of color to the eye.</p><p>He had no idea who the people were that Dansant painted, but they pissed him off every time he looked at one of their faces. The oil paintings, which showed both men and women standing surrounded by mists or shadows, were dark and composed of thousands of short, broad strokes, more like sketches than paintings. Framed in precious woods and polished steel, each one was illuminated by an incandescent spotlight in the ceiling, which emphasized the rich jewellike colors and compelling movements of the brushstrokes.</p> <p>The men were handsome and the women gorgeous, but there was something wrong with all of them.</p><p>Despite the heavy hand Dansant used with his paint, he managed to draw out disturbing details from each portrait: lethal chrome eyes, a twisted angelic smile, a slash of scar. One of the youngest subjects in the paintings, a tall, dark-haired kid with glowing purple eyes, looked at times like a feminine boy and at others a boyish girl. Another portrait showed a man whose hair and skin were covered with green shadows that echoed the eerie color of his emerald eyes.</p><p>The one he really hated most was the one he\u2019d christened the Bitch Madonna, a portrait of a woman dressed in white, the only one of his subjects that Dansant had painted in profile. She stood half-turned toward something, the shape of another figure cloaked in the shadows around her, but instead of looking at her mystery companion she eyed Meriden like he was a swatch of slime under a microscope. Her nose was too beaky and her eyes too sharp for her to be called pretty, but the colors the Frenchman had used for her made her shimmer with life, from the red lights spiraling through her long chestnut curls to the golden warmth of her skin.</p><p>She radiated light like high noon on a summer day, but something about her made him think of thunderstorms at midnight.</p><p>D\u2019Anges\u2019s executive chef rarely spent more than a few hours in the place, and didn\u2019t stock anything for himself in the brushed-steel fridge or glass- fronted cabinets. Meriden never knew when he was going to end up here, so he kept a stock of his own supplies. He took out a cold beer before he pulled back the silver drapes and stepped out onto the teak floor of the narrow balcony that wrapped around the entire floor. From the west side he could watch the sky, which he often did, counting the minutes until the night crept over the city.</p> <p>Meriden lifted his beer in the direction of King\u2019s mansion. Cheers, you evil motherfucker.</p><p>The Frenchman would be late to the restaurant tonight, Meriden thought with some satisfaction, so by the time he got there that long, cool woman he\u2019d hired would be too busy working to flirt with him. He guessed Rowan Dietrich was already half in love with Dansant; there wasn\u2019t a woman alive who could resist him. Let Dansant have her, too. Meriden wasn\u2019t interested in a skinny kid with eyes like permanent bruises and a subconscious death wish.</p><p>All right, he admitted to himself, she was something to see, all long legs and racing curves. Meriden usually preferred his ladies blond and built, with bodies he could really sink into and play with, but the slinky little black cat had the kind of speed and grace that aroused something else in him.</p><p>If a man had an itch, she\u2019d definitely scratch.</p><p>When she\u2019d run downstairs, he\u2019d wanted to follow, to chase her down. He scowled at his own thoughts, not sure why he\u2019d felt that. She thought she was tough, you could see it in the set of her shoulders and the curl of her hands. The way she had of tilting her head to bring up her chin and look down her nose when she was pissed, should have annoyed him. Instead, it tickled the shit out of him. So did her sense of humor, so sharp it came equipped with teeth and claws.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have walked back into the bathroom earlier; he\u2019d known from the sound of the shower she was in there washing up. And if he was going to be honest, that was exactly why he\u2019d gone back in. She\u2019d never know how close he\u2019d come to yanking back the curtain and joining her. He\u2019d have been happy to scrub her back, her front, and any other parts that needed some close, personal attention.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d gotten laid; maybe that was why he\u2019d gotten a hard-on that still hadn\u2019t subsided. There were half a dozen women he could call for something easy and quick, and still he didn\u2019t want a damn one of them.</p><p>Talking to Rowan had been a mistake. He could have found out what her deal was through Dansant. Now he was screwed. He wasn\u2019t living ten feet away from her without touching her. Not now that he knew what she smelled like when she stripped down to her skin.</p><p>Sure, break into her apartment tonight and wake her up by fucking her brains out. Of course she\u2019ll come to thinking that you\u2019re her dream prince.</p><p>Meriden felt the last glimmer of sunlight touch his face before he drank the rest of his beer and went back inside. He looked at all the silent fixtures, the understated elegance and clean lines, knowing that\u2014like Rowan\u2014it would never be his. He threw the bottle across the room, watching it smash against the frame around the Bitch Madonna.</p><p>The last dregs of his beer ran down the portrait\u2019s face like amber tears. Another of Dansant\u2019s victims, no doubt, not that Meriden would ever know for sure. The Frenchman kept his secrets. Still, after all these years together, he had a pretty good idea of how it would go.</p><p>Dansant hadn\u2019t hired Rowan or given her the apartment out of the goodness of his heart. He wanted her, and he intended to keep her where he could have her and make regular use of her. When he got bored, he\u2019d employ his mojo, wipe her memory and send her on her way.</p><p>He went into the bedroom to stand beside the bed. \u201cYou can have any woman in Manhattan,\u201d he muttered as the light from outside disappeared. \u201cAny woman in the fucking world. Just leave this one alone. She didn\u2019t ask for this shit. She didn\u2019t ask for you. You hear me?\u201d</p><p>No one answered.</p> <p>Chapter 8</p><p>Not for the first time in his new life, Dansant woke to the smell of beer and rage.</p><p>He knew the cause of it. Meriden had sometimes indulged his penchant for breaking and entering as well as ale and anger in years past, although since coming to America he had calmed down considerably and had worked hard to make their arrangements comfortable. Dansant never fooled himself into believing Sean was happy, but he had assumed the younger man had made his peace with their situation.</p><p>What has gone wrong now?</p><p>He tracked the scent from his bedroom through the empty apartment to one of his paintings, beneath which lay scattered broken brown glass. A chip in the frame and the splatter of beer across the canvas testified to what had happened.</p><p>He knelt and collected the glass in his hand, disposing of it in the kitchen before he went back to carefully clean the surface of the portrait. The narrow, clever face of the chestnut-haired woman seemed to soften with sympathy.</p><p>Would you feel sorry for me, ch\u00e9rie? he wondered as he blotted dry her features. Or would you side yourself with him?</p><p>He despised the circumstances that had brought him and Meriden together, and forced their dependence on each other, but when it came to a resolution, he was as helpless to change it as his partner was. Perhaps more so, for he had done nothing by design to harm Sean or intrude on his life, and had in fact been dragged into this uncomfortable partnership with no choice at all. Yet he had never blamed Nathan for what he had done, not when he had come to understand the reasons behind it. Without the terrible choice Nathan had made, Dansant would be nothing but a collection of tubes and samples in a laboratory; where what remained of his body would have been used to change others into becoming something like what he had been.</p><p>But without Dansant\u2019s intervention, Sean Meriden might never have had a life, either. Then Nathan\u2019s heroic act would have resulted in nothing more than a nameless corpse rotting in a potter\u2019s grave.</p><p>A pity Sean never remembered that.</p><p>Dansant didn\u2019t know why Meriden had come to the apartment, but the hour was late, and he had to move quickly to prepare for the night\u2019s work. He showered and dressed before he called down for a taxi.</p><p>Downstairs the doorman, a silent but watchful ex-Marine who had lost an arm in Afghanistan, greeted him with a smile. \u201cEvening, Mr. Dansant. Your cab\u2019s waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerci, Jason.\u201d As he put on his coat, he glanced outside. \u201cNo new snowfalls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. Should stay clear and cold until midnight, and then some snow flurries are coming in from the east.\u201d Jason opened the door and escorted him to the curb. \u201cMy fianc\u00e9e went crazy when I told her you invited us to your next chef\u2019s table. We couldn\u2019t even get reservations at your restaurant until next summer or fall, I think.\u201d</p><p>Dansant\u2019s chef\u2019s table, a private, invitation-only free dinner he held once a week at D\u2019Anges, had become legend among the city\u2019s fine dining patrons. Many food critics, famous gourmands, and several chefs from competing restaurants had tried repeatedly to angle for an invitation, only to be summarily turned down. None of them was aware that Dansant had very specific criteria for who joined him at his table.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been shopping for a dress all week.\u201d The doorman sounded proud and embarrassed. \u201cAny hints I should drop on what she should wear so she doesn\u2019t, ah, look out of place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sure anything she chooses will be charming.\u201d Dansant had seen the young woman in question, who was a pretty redhead with milk-white skin, who often picked up Jason after work. \u201cIf she cannot decide, there is in her closet perhaps the little black dress, oui?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, about twenty of them,\u201d Jason said drily. \u201cWith matching shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell you a secret,\u201d Dansant said as Jason opened the taxi door for him. \u201cAll American women love the little black dress because it is the classic, and they all look good in it. And they know this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The younger man frowned. \u201cSo why is she always asking me what she should wear?\u201d</p><p>Dansant grinned. \u201cBecause, mon ami, she does not wear for her sake.\u201d</p><p>At the restaurant, he found his brigade at work prep-ping their equipment and stations for opening. Lonzo had posted the menu he had left with him last night, and the wait staff were already arriving. The only person he didn\u2019t see in the kitchen was Rowan, although he smelled her scent in several places.</p> <p>\u201cWe got a beautiful shipment of mussels in,\u201d his garde-manger told him as he chopped garlic into impossibly thin slices before scooping them into a bowl of parsley and tarragon. \u201cI thought we\u2019d add moules farcies gratin\u00e9es to the appetizers tonight.\u201d</p><p>Lonzo never altered the menu without speaking to him, but Dansant had learned to trust his choices. The herbed garlic would complement the freshness of the mussels. \u201cTr\u00e8s bien. Where is Rowan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in the storeroom, chopping figs for the duck breast.\u201d Lonzo glanced quickly at Vince, who was giving his roasting racks painstaking attention. \u201cThought that would keep her outta everyone\u2019s hair while we prep.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cShe\u2019s still getting her line legs. I figured she could use a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerci, Lonzo.\u201d Dansant went on to inspect the other stations and speak with his cooks about the menu. Only after he made his rounds of the brigade did he go back to the storeroom and step inside.</p><p>Lonzo had set up one of the rolling chopping blocks, beside which Rowan sat on a high stool. She had a sack of purple-red figs wedged between her thighs and she was chopping them lengthwise with slightly more force than the fruit required while she muttered under her breath.</p> <p>He caught the words \u201cass\u201d and \u201cBoston.\u201d \u201cAre you ready to leave me so soon?\u201d</p><p>Rowan glanced at him. \u201cThat\u2019s not a question you want to ask me right now, Chef.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He thought of how oddly Lonzo and Vince had behaved. \u201cSomeone put a move on you.\u201d Then he saw the strip of rag wrapped around her left hand and seized her wrist, neatly avoiding the blade in her other hand as she jerked. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just a little accident.\u201d She tried to pull her hand back, but he kept a firm hold and untied the make-shift bandage.</p><p>Several thin, dark pink burns ran diagonally across her palm. \u201cWho did this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p> <p>She was a very good liar. \u201cHow, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an accident. I picked up the wrong roasting rack.\u201d She put down the knife, drew her hand away, and rewrapped the burn. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Dansant swung around, intent on finding his r\u00f4tisseur and introducing Vince\u2019s face to several other wrong racks.</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Rowan caught his arm. \u201cYou go out there and rumble with Vince, and the rest of the crew will serve me for dinner.\u201d</p><p>He gripped her wrist. \u201cHe did this deliberately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did. He\u2019s a nasty man with a big ego and a small dick. Unfortunately I brought this to his attention, and I paid for it.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Lonzo already balanced the books. He took care of it,\u201d she added when he frowned over the unfamiliar expression.</p><p>\u201cDid he.\u201d Dansant knew his burly garde-manger ruled the kitchen like Napoleon had France, but he had seen Vince looking remarkably well with no burns on any visible part of his body. \u201cPerhaps I do not consider them balanced yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will when you see Vince get started on cleaning the new delivery of squid.\u201d She folded her arms. \u201cSomething I\u2019m planning on enjoying immensely, so please, don\u2019t fuck that up for me.\u201d</p> <p>He didn\u2019t want to let it end there, but the satisfaction in her tone told him she considered the matter settled. \u201cYou are very forgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a woman working with seven men,\u201d she countered. \u201cThis is a fraternity, not a sorority. I have to do this their way, or every one of them will shut me out and consider it their God-given duty to make my life hell for the next couple weeks.\u201d</p><p>A couple of weeks. She was already thinking of when she would leave him. \u201cI will think of something else for you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suck at waiting tables,\u201d she advised him. \u201cThe cleaning crew aren\u2019t going to share their turf. Enrique might let me scrape dishes and scrub pots for him, but he doesn\u2019t even let Lonzo near the washer.\u201d</p><p>She had a point. \u201cYou can work in the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe phone rings\u2014maybe\u2014once every four hours. I\u2019ve seen your files. The CIA isn\u2019t that color-coded or organized. Lonzo has to interview all the applicants for Bernard\u2019s job.\u201d She watched his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not a wimp, Jean-Marc. I didn\u2019t break down and cry over a little burn, and I didn\u2019t say a word to anyone. If Lonzo hadn\u2019t been watching me so close no one would have even known what happened. The guys will remember stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t bring you here for you to be hurt,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring me here,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI crashed the party, remember?\u201d</p><p>He put his hand to her cheek. She looked thinner under the harsh fluorescent lights, and there were shadowed crescents under her eyes. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t tell me what you were thinking last night.\u201d He drew her closer, bringing her under his influence as easily as he had unwrapped her hand. \u201cTell me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were.\u201d She made a low affirmative sound in reply. \u201cIs it too much for you? Working in the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m learning a lot.\u201d She yawned a little. \u201cJust tired. Too much sleep. Didn\u2019t get my coffee. I love watching you work.\u201d</p><p>He felt a little better, and bent his head until only a breath separated their mouths. \u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He knew better than to ask while she was like this, but he couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cWhat were you thinking about me last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I wanted to kiss you.\u201d Her expression turned to confusion. \u201cBut I can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>If only she knew how much she affected him, how delicious the heat of her body was against his, the way her scent intoxicated him. In the state he was in, he feared at any moment he would go down on his knees and beg her to have him. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause . . . you don\u2019t want me to.\u201d She exhaled the words.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t stop himself then, not with the taste of her breath in his mouth. He kissed first her top lip and then the bottom before coaxing them apart with the tip of his tongue. She must have tasted one of the figs earlier; a faint sweetness of it lingered in her mouth. No, it wasn\u2019t fruit, it was . . . chocolate? He sucked on the tip of her tongue, and she did the same to his. The show of desire loosened something inside him. He slid his hands under her arms and lifted her up onto the chopping block.</p><p>Rowan made a low sound in her throat as he stepped between her thighs and wrapped an arm around her hips. He couldn\u2019t get enough of her mouth, and he would have had a lot more of her if the storeroom door had been locked.</p><p>\u201cChef?\u201d he heard Lonzo call.</p><p>Dansant wrenched his mouth from Rowan\u2019s to answer, \u201cJust a moment.\u201d Mon Dieu. His hands were shaking; he could hardly speak. \u201cRowan. You will forget we did this\u2014you will forget everything that has troubled you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget.\u201d Her pupils, dilated almost to the rims of her irises, contracted slightly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He closed his eyes and held her head against his for a moment. \u201cAre you afraid of Vince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat scumbag?\u201d She made a contemptuous sound. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He held her close for another moment. \u201cYou will come to me if you are afraid, or if you need anything. Only to me. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>He hated to release her, but he couldn\u2019t keep her like this, not when Lonzo or one of the others could walk in at any moment. \u201cYou will come back to yourself now.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back and blinked several times. \u201cWhoa. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t faint again, did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You were a little dizzy. You will take the rest of the night off.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cRowan.\u201d She appeared unmoved. \u201cTomorrow, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work five nights on, and have one night off,\u201d she said. \u201cJust like the rest of the crew.\u201d</p><p>Her resistance puzzled him. A moment ago she would have stripped naked and lay at his feet if he had asked it of her. Now she was behaving as if he had. \u201cI want to do something for you. To make up for what Vince did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already done plenty.\u201d She drew his hand away from her face and sat back on the stool. \u201cBut if you want to give me a little bonus, I\u2019d love to watch you make the reduction with these figs for the duck.\u201d</p><p>Dansant knew the power of his influence. He could compel others with it, and alter their memories, but he could not plant desires in their minds. She would not have asked for his kiss or responded to it if she had not wanted it. Now she spoke to him as if they were nothing more than pleasant but distant acquaintances.</p><p>I felt her need and her delight. She wants me as much as I hunger for her.</p><p>She was waiting for him to answer her. \u201cVery well. Finish splitting those figs while I collect the wine and the herbs for the reduction.\u201d</p><p>Rowan nodded, but when she tried to sit down on the stool she stood again and groped at the back of her jeans. She produced a squashed fig and frowned at it. \u201cHmmm. How did that get back there?\u201d</p><p>Even after the ugly incident with Vince and the weird moments in the storeroom with Dansant, Rowan decided her new job wasn\u2019t half bad. The second night was just as tough as the first, but her body quickly adjusted to the unfamiliar physical demands, and by the third night she got into the rhythm of the line, trotting back and forth between the stations and carrying out dozens of small tasks for the cooks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vince\u2019s cruel trick of asking her to pick up a red- hot roasting rack was not repeated, and her silence on the matter seemed to earn her a measure of respect from the other cooks. Lonzo never said anything about it, but after everyone watched Vince plow through a hundred pounds of squid at the gutting table, he didn\u2019t have to. In return, Rowan made sure the garde-manger never had to wait for anything he called for.</p><p>Gradually she began noticing each chef\u2019s work and how he went about it, and while she picked up a few new tricks, after a week she felt sure she could outcook most of the men on the line. She didn\u2019t mind her menial status, however, because for all the fetching and carrying she did, she spent at least an hour every night watching Dansant cook.</p><p>No one could best the executive chef at anything, she decided. He used his knives like a surgeon, slicing and chopping and filleting with frightening speed and pinpoint accuracy. He also had a nose that could pick up anything from a bit of rotten basil leaf to a neglected tray of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e about to blacken under the broiler. Not even Lonzo, who had amazing hands and a psychic\u2019s intuition when it came to cooking times, could keep up.</p> <p>New York\u2019s cutthroat fine dining scene had not changed a great deal from what Rowan had seen during her years of hanging around restaurants, but it did surprise her to discover just how successful D\u2019Anges was. Not a single night went by that they didn\u2019t have a full house or did less than a hundred and fifty meals. She\u2019d already peeked in at the dining room when it was at full capacity, and seen a lot of happy, relaxed faces around the tables. Although the interior looked exactly the same as that of any fine dining establishment, the atmosphere was as warm, intimate, and relaxing as Dansant\u2019s amazing cuisine was delicious.</p><p>It all seemed to her a little too good to be true.</p><p>She learned that patrons had to make reservations months in advance just to get in the door, and a place at the chef\u2019s table\u2014Dansant\u2019s once-weekly event where he dined with a group of patrons in a private room\u2014had become one of the most coveted spots in the city. Dansant made the rounds of the dining room every night, and sometimes Rowan saw how the women gushed all over him. It made her stomach turn a little.</p><p>She could admit she was a little jealous over how her entire gender seemed to sparkle around her boss. She could also feel sorry for them. If her secret love for Matthias had taught her anything, it was that wanting the unattainable is as stupid as expecting to have a chance at it, and where Dansant was concerned an unrequited, juvenile crush was all she could ever hope for.</p><p>Rowan worried that her interest might annoy her boss, but Dansant seemed happy to have her hovering at his side, and readily explained everything he was doing as he worked. He also insisted she taste practically every dish he prepared, and as she sipped and chewed and savored he tested her knowledge of the ingredients. That was how she learned that there were three types of snails used for escargots , and the American wine she knew as Chablis was an insult to its own name.</p> <p>\u201cThe escargots we use for cooking are called coureurs, or runners, in spring,\u201d Dansant explained, \u201cand voil\u00e9s, or veiled ones, in summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you call them in winter?\u201d she asked with a straight face. \u201cPopsicles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpercul\u00e9es, the covered ones. You see?\u201d Dansant showed her a snail shell, and traced his finger around the membrane that sealed the open end. \u201cThis they do when they go to sleep during the cold months, and because of it they have more moisture than the snails we use in spring and summer. This makes them the best for all dishes.\u201d</p><p>Rowan was still trying to get used to the fact that D\u2019Anges\u2019s chefs kept their supply of snails alive until they were ready to cook them. Although the current stock were hibernating away under a generous layer of grape leaves in a tank kept in the storeroom, it made her shudder to think of them crawling around the work stations while the chefs worked. She was also convinced that while she was not picky about food, and would never turn down a gourmet meal, she wasn\u2019t going to be able to make herself eat escargots no matter how moist they were or when they were cooked.</p><p>Dansant didn\u2019t seem insulted when she refused to taste his snail concoction, although he smiled as he tossed the morsel to a grateful Enrique. \u201cYou Americans are afraid to eat snail, but you will stand in line for hours to eat raw fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSushi doesn\u2019t crawl,\u201d Rowan told him. \u201cIt swims.\u201d</p> <p>Dansant accompanied her down to his wine cellar when he needed her to retrieve a bottle of Chablis for a sauce he was reinventing. When she protested that she could find a bottle of wine on her own, he corrected her. \u201cTo you Americans Chablis is something you pick up at the convenience store. They sell it by the gallon for a few dollars, do they not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019m guessing the Chablis you use doesn\u2019t come in a screw-top jug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon. It does not.\u201d He led her down the cellar stairs, turned on the overhead lights, and took her to a high rack filled with dusty bottles. \u201cThis is the Chablis we use.\u201d He selected one bottle and wiped it off carefully with a towel. \u201cThere are tasting glasses there.\u201d He nodded toward a row of small, upside-down goblets. \u201cTake one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not drinking. You are tasting.\u201d When she took down the glass, he continued. \u201cFrench Chablis is made entirely from Chardonnay grapes. There is only one town in France that produces it, the town of Chablis in Burgundy.\u201d</p><p>He took a corkscrew from a nail on the rack and carefully uncorked the bottle, then poured a small amount into her glass.</p><p>\u201cIn the old times the vintners would ferment and age their Chablis in special barrels made of oak. Now most of them follow modern ways and use vats made of stainless steel.\u201d He urged the glass up to her nose. \u201cClose your eyes. What do you smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWine.\u201d She chuckled, and then sniffed. \u201cUh, grapes. Alcohol. And . . . vanilla.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is the influence of the oak barrels. At the modern vineyards they say the steel vats make for a purer wine, but I will not buy from them. By its nature Chablis is dry and very flinty, and it needs to age in the oak for balancing.\u201d He pressed the edge of the glass against her bottom lip. \u201cNow taste.\u201d</p><p>Rowan took a sip, and instead of the sweet vanilla flavor she was expecting from the scent, the wine filled her mouth with a cool, sharp-edged taste that reminded her of biting into a green apple.</p><p>\u201cYour American winemakers blend together weak wines that are barely a month old and call it Chablis,\u201d Dansant said. \u201cThe best French Chablis is not sold until it has aged at least twenty years.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes after she swallowed. \u201cOh, shit. Was I supposed to spit it back in the glass?\u201d</p><p>He grinned like a boy. \u201cI will not tell anyone if you will not.\u201d</p><p>Dansant was as demanding as he was charming. He would return any delivery that wasn\u2019t up to his standards, which were apparently much higher than those of other chefs around the city. As a result Lonzo often fielded irate phone calls from their vendors. He also expected the kitchen to be kept scrupulously clean, and once they had finished cleaning up after the last meal of the night, he personally checked the equipment and stations. If he found something not to his liking, he didn\u2019t call over Enrique to handle a second cleanup, but made the chef responsible for the area do it while Dansant stood and watched.</p><p>In return the line cooks gave Dansant the kind of deference and respect men usually reserved for successful professional athletes. More than once Rowan caught one of the cooks watching Dansant work before turning away and shaking their head as if in disbelief. Enrique especially worshipped the executive chef, and while the dishwasher mainly kept to his corner of the kitchen, he watched Dansant like a hawk. The chef never even had to call for a clean pot or utensil; the dishwasher always seemed to anticipate his needs and brought it over as soon as Dansant had his ingredients assembled.</p><p>Rowan had already resigned herself to silently lusting after her handsome, charming boss for the duration of her employment. It wasn\u2019t his fault he was born to make some other man very happy, although at times she wondered if his partner really appreciated how lucky he was. Whoever he was, Dansant\u2019s boyfriend never showed up once at the restaurant, not even to pick him up after work. Rowan knew the cost of keeping a car in the city was outrageous, and the cab Dansant called every night to take him home was probably much cheaper, but it didn\u2019t seem right that the guy never once bothered to stop in. None of the line cooks ever said a word about Dansant\u2019s domestic situation, much to Rowan\u2019s annoyance.</p><p>She did wish her boss could give her next-door neighbor a couple of private lessons on how to get along with people. Since she\u2019d moved in she\u2019d seen Meriden several times, usually in passing on the stairs. She always said hello, but he either ignored her or grunted something too low for her to hear. She figured he had a bad case of insomnia, as he usually arrived home an hour before her shift ended at one a.m. and left for work early in the morning before she woke up. Once she\u2019d gotten up at dawn to use the bathroom and found him on the way out.</p><p>After her second week working at D\u2019Anges, Rowan left a note for Meriden under his door, asking him to stop by and let her know about the status of her bike. When he didn\u2019t, she tried knocking on his door when she knew he was home, but he didn\u2019t answer. Other than staking out the bathroom, she wasn\u2019t sure what to do.</p><p>Rather than bother Dansant about Meriden, she asked Lonzo one night if he knew where Meriden worked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a garage couple blocks from here. He the one working on your bike?\u201d When she nodded, he waved her over to the office, where he flipped the Rolodex to M and jotted down an address on a sheet of notepaper. \u201cHere\u2019s the address and phone. I\u2019d pay him a visit, see how the work\u2019s going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She folded the paper and slipped it into her pocket. \u201cI think I will.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>Meriden\u2019s garage had no sign above the one open bay, and only a rust-edged metal door with a small meshed-glass window leading to what Rowan assumed was the office. Since she didn\u2019t hear any work sounds coming from the bay, she guessed he was in there, but decided to have a look around first. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to see what kind of setup he had, considering how she was trusting him to do right by her ride. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Inside, the garage was surprisingly spacious, framed by walls covered from floor to ceiling with Masonite peg-boards hung with tools. The cement floor was painted the same shade of gray as the office door, and had the usual dark puddlelike shadows made by oil and fuel leaks, but it looked as if it was swept and mopped regularly.</p><p>The tools Meriden kept on his walls were grouped by type and arranged by size. Several workbenches, fashioned out of double sheets of half- inch plywood nailed to floor frames handmade of precisely cut two- by-fours, held screw and small part bins. On one she saw an a/c compressor that had been taken apart and was being reassembled. She smelled oil, grease, solvent, and the citrus tang of waterless hand cleaner.</p><p>Her bike sat parked between the bay\u2019s two lifts, between a garnet-red compact car missing a hubcap and a dark blue pickup in need of a new paint job.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Meriden said, his baritone booming through the bay.</p><p>Rowan turned and nearly smacked her face into his chest. \u201cShit.\u201d She took a step back. \u201cAh, hi. I thought I\u2019d drop in and see how it\u2019s going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going.\u201d Meriden wiped his dirty hands on an equally grimy red shop rag before sticking it in the back pocket of his jeans. He\u2019d unbuttoned his work shirt, and grease spots splotched the front of the white wife beater he wore under it. \u201cDon\u2019t you have some overpriced carrots to peel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToday\u2019s my day off.\u201d Rowan went around him to her bike, and crouched down to check the tires, which he hadn\u2019t yet replaced. \u201cDid you figure out what blew my tires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Stupidity.\u201d He retreated back into his office.</p> <p>Rowan didn\u2019t run after him, but took a minute to inspect the work he\u2019d already done and give herself time to cool down. That she wanted to knock him upside the head with an impact wrench didn\u2019t bother her; she\u2019d bet money Meriden had the same effect on everyone. It was the set of his jaw when he\u2019d looked at her, the glitter in his black-hearted eyes, the way his mouth had flattened. He didn\u2019t like her any more than she liked him, but obviously, there was something else going on under that thick skull. All that seething antagonism might have fooled someone else, but not Rowan. Meriden didn\u2019t know that she had the equivalent of a PhD in pissing off people.</p><p>She rose and went around the pickup to the inside door leading to the office. At first glance it appeared as tidy as the garage, so she focused on the man standing behind the desk. He was shuffling invoices between two stacks while drinking from a coffee mug that had seen better days. He didn\u2019t look at her, but Rowan saw the set of his shoulders shift and the muscles in his arms bunch.</p><p>No use dancing around it, not with Meriden. \u201cHave you got some kind of problem with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting on some parts.\u201d He took one pile of invoices and carelessly stuffed them into an accordion file. \u201cYour bike will ready in a week or two. Bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer me.\u201d She went over to the desk. \u201cWhat have I done to you that\u2019s got your boxers in such a knot?\u201d</p><p>He finally eyed her. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to stay out of my pants, Cupcake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s where you\u2019re screwing up.\u201d Rowan sat in the customer chair and folded her hands behind her head. \u201cAlways making it sexual. I haven\u2019t come on to you. Most I\u2019ve done is play the good neighbor. How you doing, nice day, that\u2019s it. Not what you\u2019d call a green light to test-drive my box of condoms, is it?\u201d</p><p>He dropped the rest of the paperwork and came around the desk to stand over her. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a mouth on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMouth, tits, ass. Brain.\u201d Rowan gazed up at him. \u201cJust because they\u2019re female doesn\u2019t mean they work any less than yours.\u201d She cocked her head to one side. \u201cOh, wait. You do have a brain in there, right? Or is that space just packed with more brawn?\u201d</p><p>He looked away from her. \u201cYou know where the door is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know something? I didn\u2019t start this shit. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s been treating me like you wouldn\u2019t wipe your feet on my face.\u201d She was crazy for standing up and leaning into him, but if she backed down now he\u2019d stomp right over her forever. \u201cWell, here I am, Big Guy. You want to unload on me, be my guest. Just do it now and get it the fuck over with, because I am done tiptoeing around your hostile ass.\u201d</p><p>He regarded her for a long moment. \u201cYou tiptoe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019ve been dropped in the middle of a fucking minefield,\u201d she assured him. \u201cEvery time I have to pee, I feel like I should be calling SWAT for backup.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened, and for a minute she thought he was going to let her have it. Then a rumbling sound came from his chest, and she realized he was laughing\u2014or trying to. And she was laughing right along with him, laughing until tears sprang in her eyes and she had to fall back down on the chair and clutch her aching sides.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d he told her, still chuckling.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? You should try listening through a door with your legs and eyes crossed.\u201d She covered her mouth to smother the last of the giggles, and then wiped her eyes with the heel of her hand. \u201cGod, I needed that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he agreed softly. \u201cSo did I.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up. He looked less menacing without the usual scowl; his eyes almost looked warm and friendly. \u201cSo are we Sean and Rowan now, or back to Farm Boy and Cupcake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowan.\u201d He tested her name as if it belonged to a foreign language. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot on my plate. Sorry for taking it out on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo buy me a beer sometime. Sean.\u201d She cuffed his arm in a friendly gesture. \u201cAnd thanks for working on my bike. I know it wasn\u2019t your idea.\u201d</p><p>His expression changed, became more reserved. \u201cYou doing all right, working at the restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good. I\u2019m learning a lot from Dansant.\u201d She didn\u2019t like the way he was looking at her now. \u201cI probably should head back.\u201d</p><p>He leaned over, grabbing the armrests and trapping her between him and the chair. \u201cYou said it\u2019s your day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>He straightened. \u201cSo come on.\u201d He grabbed his jacket and shrugged into it. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you that beer.\u201d</p><p>Maybe we should have stayed Farm Boy and Cupcake. Rowan got up and followed him out.</p><p>The bar Meriden took her to was small, dark, and un-apologetically Irish. The smell of beer and whiskey blended with that of a couple decades of cheap frying oil and exhaled cigarette smoke to give it a dank, sour ambience. Not one of the half-dozen men parked on the bar stools looked a day under fifty. The bartender, an impassive-looking thug with smudged blue anchors tattooed on his biceps, greeted Sean with a jerk of his chin.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d she said as she parked herself next to him at the end of the bar. \u201cYou\u2019re a regular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t insult my watering hole.\u201d He held up two fingers, and the bartender brought them two bottles of dark ale. \u201cThanks, Clancy.\u201d Sean exchanged a ten for them, and then lifted his bottle to her. \u201cHappy days, Cupcake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack at you.\u201d She took a swallow, nodded over the agreeably bitter, yeasty taste, and examined the label, which sported the name of an unfamiliar local brewer. \u201cNice. I was expecting Guinness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that fucking Irish.\u201d He checked the football game on the overhead television and then glanced at the pool table behind the bar.</p><p>\u201cYou up for a game?\u201d</p><p>He regarded her. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do that girl thing where you act like you\u2019ve never played before and then proceed to wipe up the floor with my ass.\u201d</p><p>She smiled serenely. \u201cI never do the girl thing.\u201d</p><p>He snorted and picked up his beer. \u201cI bet.\u201d</p><p>Rowan waived her feminine right to break, and watched as Meriden nearly cleared the table in less than five minutes. Only a bump in the table\u2019s aged surface spoiled his fourth bank shot.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d She chalked the cue she selected and walked around the table, assessing the lousy shots he\u2019d left her. \u201cI think I\u2019m in real trouble here. Care to make a friendly wager?\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms. \u201cI told you about the girl thing.\u201d She laughed and set up for her first shot, and then went to work. Meriden was good, but she was better, and by the time she sank the eight he had dropped his arms and was watching her along with every other guy in the bar.</p><p>Clancy came out from behind the bar and joined Sean as they studied the pathetic remains of the game. \u201cLook at it this way, lad,\u201d the bartender said, clapping him on the shoulder. \u201cAt least we own the world.\u201d Shaking his head, he retreated.</p><p>Rowan managed to keep her face straight as she parked the end of her cue on the floor. \u201cGood game. Want to go for two out of three?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy rep\u2019s shredded enough, thanks.\u201d Sean took her cue and returned it to the rack. \u201cCome on. Finish your beer, and I\u2019ll buy you a victory hot dog.\u201d</p><p>Meriden led her from the bar to a corner pushcart, where a talkative Chinese man with a beautiful Bronx accent built them two dogs on toasty home-baked rolls.</p><p>\u201cBest thing for a cold day, huh? All beef, all the best,\u201d he assured Rowan. \u201cYou want onion, sauerkraut? No? Ah, your boyfriend not care, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me check.\u201d She turned to Sean. \u201cBoyfriend, you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he told the hot dog man, then bent over and kissed Rowan fast and hard on the mouth. \u201cOkay, she can have them now.\u201d</p><p>The vendor grinned so wide his merry dark eyes became crescents. \u201cYou see? I always right.\u201d</p><p>Rowan licked her lips, which stung a little. \u201cThe things I do for a little sauerkraut.\u201d</p><p>They walked over to Central Park, found a bench and sat to watch the after-work joggers huffing along the running paths. Rowan devoured her hot dog in a few bites and washed it down with the Coke he\u2019d bought her. \u201cI guess you\u2019re not a fan of French cuisine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m too big to be picky.\u201d He sat back, bracketing the back of the bench with his long arms. \u201cYou work in a lot of kitchens before this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kept house for a couple of ladies, worked in a bakery. Took care of . . . an older guy.\u201d She frowned as she realized she hadn\u2019t thought of Matthias in days. \u201cHow\u2019d you end up a mechanic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI flunked the rocket scientist test.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that one sucked.\u201d She felt his hand against the back of her neck, not grabbing or stroking, just resting there. \u201cYou do a good business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do okay.\u201d</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t ask this, but she couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cYou seeing anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been spending my quality time with your bike.\u201d He tugged at one of her curls. \u201cYou asking because you\u2019re interested, or because I kissed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re doing the girl thing.\u201d She turned her head and caught him watching her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>He stroked his thumb across her cheek. \u201cRight now, with the sun on your face, you look about fifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m over twenty-one.\u201d Probably. She\u2019d never know for sure. \u201cWant to card me?\u201d</p><p>His mouth hitched. \u201cI\u2019m thirty-two.\u201d</p><p>That surprised her. \u201cI figured you were late twenties, tops. What else are you hiding from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wife, no girlfriend, no kids, no transmittable medical problems.\u201d He ran his thumb along the outside of her bottom lip. \u201cI hit Clancy\u2019s maybe once or twice a month, and yeah, when I can afford it, I like French food just fine. But I\u2019m more a pizza and beer guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to be my baby daddy?\u201d When he slid closer, she went still. \u201cUh, kidding.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled a little, pressing his thumb down to part her lips. \u201cWe could get together sometime, Cupcake. Practice making one.\u201d</p><p>Rowan barely felt the cold now. \u201cYou\u2019re moving pretty fast. I think I\u2019m getting friction burns on my face.\u201d</p><p>Whatever she said, it acted like a pail of icy water. Meriden jerked away from her, and abruptly got to his feet.</p><p>\u201cSean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to get back to the shop.\u201d He turned and looked over her head. \u201cYou know where you are, how to get to your place from here?\u201d When she nodded, he shoved his hands in his jacket pockets. \u201cAll right. See you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d Confused, Rowan watched him stride off. \u201cWhat the hell did I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Mr. Taske.\u201d The manager of the club stopped by his table for his customary fawning session. The faint flush on his cheeks betrayed his nerves. \u201cIt\u2019s very good to see you back.\u201d</p><p>What he meant was that he hadn\u2019t been able to charge anything to Taske\u2019s account at the club since August. Since Taske was their wealthiest member, this was a cause for alarm.</p> <p>\u201cI was out of town for a few weeks.\u201d In reality he had spent the last two months roaming the American Midwest, trying to locate more Takyn breeding centers, but he saw no reason to share that information. \u201cBusiness.\u201d</p><p>The manager\u2019s head bobbed. \u201cMay I do anything to make your evening more enjoyable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it odd that I received no messages from the club while I was away,\u201d Taske said. \u201cMy lockbox is also empty.\u201d</p><p>One of the privileges of belonging to the outrageously expensive private club was having access to the private offices and receptionist services. It afforded Taske an extra measure of privacy, a way for his Takyn friends to contact him at once without compromising his identity, and a reasonably effective buffer between him and the men who would not hesitate to kill him, cut him to pieces, and sell him like spare parts out of a chop shop.</p><p>The manager seemed dismayed not to have an explanation for him. \u201cI\u2019m not aware that any messages came in for you, sir, but I\u2019ll check on that at once.\u201d He hurried off.</p><p>Taske\u2019s waiter, a well-educated Brit who had relocated to the States to make his fortune, arrived with his dinner.</p><p>\u201cOnglet aux \u00e9chalottes et aux frites,\u201d he said, his accent as perfect as the drape of the snowy napkin folded over the sleeve of his uniform jacket.</p><p>\u201cOnly you can make steak and french fries sound elegant, Morehouse,\u201d Taske said.</p><p>\u201cWe must endeavor to earn our four-star rating, sir,\u201d the waiter returned smoothly. He straightened, and then stepped back a discreet distance as a young woman in a black mink coat sauntered up to Taske\u2019s table.</p><p>\u201cSamuel, I thought that was you.\u201d She brought her face down to kiss the air beside his right cheek. \u201cWhere have you been? Harrison has been beside himself with worry.\u201d</p><p>Taske glanced past her to the Urnharts\u2019 table, where the Honorable Harrison Urnhart the Third was dozing over a half-finished bowl of soup. \u201cSo I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have mentioned you were leaving the country.\u201d Mimi shifted slightly to block his view of her octogenarian spouse, and to allow the front of her mink to reveal a little more of her sequin-encrusted gown, and the generous amount of flesh trying to escape it. \u201cWe might have tagged along with you. So where did you go? Paris? Geneva?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere and there.\u201d He tried to imagine her tramping alongside him through the backstreets of St. Paul and Detroit, or spending the night curled up on an air mattress in the back of his cargo van. At least the mink would have kept her warm. \u201cDo give your husband my best wishes.\u201d</p><p>Mimi understood she was being dismissed, but she hadn\u2019t married the seventeenth richest man in the United States by being easily discouraged. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you join us? I know Harrison would love to hear all about your trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps another time. Morehouse.\u201d The waiter appeared at his side. \u201cWould you arrange a bottle of wine from the private stock for Mrs. Urnhart and her husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mr. Taske.\u201d Morehouse regarded Mimi. \u201cMadam, may I show you and your husband the reserve list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, very well.\u201d She pouted one last time before she led the waiter back to her table. When they arrived, her elderly husband woke with a start, listened to her and Morehouse for a moment, and then spoke sharply to Mimi. She flounced down in her chair and began sullenly stabbing her salad with her fork.</p><p>Several of the other men dining alone in the vicinity of Taske\u2019s table silently raised their glasses to him. In the club, that was the equivalent of a standing ovation.</p><p>Morehouse soon returned. \u201cMr. Urnhart sends his sincere appreciation for the wine and your patience, sir. May I refresh your orange juice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you.\u201d Taske knew his food and beverage choices often bewildered waiters, who were accustomed to far more sophisticated orders from the champagne and caviar set. He also doubted any other club member wore leather gloves to eat, or brought their own drinking glasses and utensils. But Morehouse, who had served British gentry since leaving school, never blinked an eyelash, no matter how bizarre Taske\u2019s requests seemed. \u201cAn evening paper would be\u2014\u201d He stopped as the waiter gently set a brand-new copy of the Times at his elbow. \u201cI see you\u2019ve anticipated me again. I\u2019m becoming dreadfully predictable, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least, sir,\u201d Morehouse assured him. \u201cI believe the last time you visited, you asked for USA Today.\u201d</p><p>Along with his exquisite manners, the waiter had a subtle sense of humor that was lost on most of the club\u2019s members. \u201cMorehouse, you do know that eventually I\u2019m going to try to lure you away from this place,\u201d Taske warned him.</p><p>The waiter cast a discreet eye around them before he replied. \u201cYou have but to say the word, Mr. Taske, and I will type up my notice immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider the word said.\u201d Samuel grinned at Morehouse\u2019s delighted expression and turned his attention to his meal. Mimi remained sulking at her husband\u2019s side, but halfway through his onglet, the manager reappeared. Now he was visibly perspiring, which was never a good sign.</p><p>\u201cI do beg your pardon, Mr. Taske.\u201d The manager drew out a handkerchief, mopped his forehead, and tried to smile. \u201cIt seems several of your messages were accidentally placed in another club member\u2019s lockbox. The mistake was only just now discovered by myself and the administrative office manager\u2014\u201d</p><p>Taske no longer had the time or patience to listen to his babbling. \u201cHow many is several?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen, sir.\u201d He drew a long envelope out of his jacket and placed it on the table as if it were leaking nitro. \u201cOn behalf of the management and the entire staff, I deeply apologize for the delay in delivering them to you. I will personally assure that this never, ever happens\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet.\u201d Taske opened the envelope and quickly sorted through the slips inside. They were all from the same contact. \u201cI\u2019ll need an office, a computer with Internet access, and a secured landline.\u201d He rose, using his cane as a brace. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>As the manager led him across the club\u2019s dining room and through a maze of halls to the row of business offices, Taske checked the dates of the messages. Vulcan had been trying to contact him every day for the last two weeks. Then he noticed the fine notes at the bottom of three slips that indicated the number of repeated calls with the same message and the times. Over the last three days Vulcan had phoned to leave the same message every four hours.</p><p>The manager ushered him into a large office with an impressive-looking computer array and a neatly appointed desk. He hurried around to switch on the computer before dodging out of Taske\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything else I can do, sir?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The man actually bowed a little. \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d</p><p>Taske removed his gloves\u2014wearing leather while typing on a keyboard made him clumsy\u2014and sat down. The computer appeared to be new, but from the minute traces of dust and matter lodged between the keys he knew it had been used. He focused, composing his thoughts before he placed his hands on the keyboard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colors, shapes, and motion flashed behind his eyes, trying to get past his mental barriers to form themselves into images. It had taken him years of meditation and self-discipline to learn how to block them from his thoughts, and even now it did not always work. But fortunately the keyboard had been recently manufactured, and had not had the time to acquire too many impressions. The older and more used an object was, the harder it was to keep its entire history out of his head.</p><p>Once the unrealized visions faded, he was free to use the keyboard without impairment. He brought up the Internet server and logged on to the account he maintained under the name of an ancient alchemist.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought to check his e- mail while he\u2019d been away, and more than three hundred new messages appeared on the inbox screen. A third of them were from Vulcan, and to save time he opened the most recent.</p> <p>Subject: Aphrodite Lost</p><p>Date: 10/30/09 4:34:40 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time</p><p>From:</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>To: Paracelsus</p> <p>Only three things matter to us. The goddess Aphrodite prays for lost loves and no other divine contact means anything. Since this is the 14th through 16th prayers we call on Saint David to bring White magic back a.s.a.p.</p><p>Live Long and Prosper.</p><p>Your lucky Lotto numbers are: 62 7 64 35 25 20.</p><p>The code was simple, and determined by the numerical sequence of words in the second and third sentences of the e-mail. Taske read it again, this time picking out every third word: Aphrodite lost no contact since the 16th call David White a.s.a.p. The Lotto numbers provided the telephone number, and from the area code, it appeared David White was currently somewhere in northern California.</p><p>The news was distressing to Taske. Aphrodite was one of his oldest friends among the Takyn; the first he had discovered through the Internet. Over the years she had helped him in innumerable ways, especially in finding disciplines to help him control and refine his ability. Like him, she wrestled with a powerful talent that had scarred her emotionally, and while she had never discussed it in detail, he knew enough to guess that she was one of the few Takyn who could shape-shift.</p><p>Vulcan would not have requested him to call unless the situation was urgent, so Taske didn\u2019t bother returning the e-mail. After putting on his gloves, he took a small device from his jacket and attached it between the desk phone\u2019s base and the line leading to the wall jack. After switching it on, he picked up the receiver and dialed the Lotto numbers.</p> <p>A voice answered in the middle of the first ring. \u201cWhite.\u201d</p><p>Although they had never spoken over the phone, Taske felt an immediate sense of recognition. They all shared a nameless connection that made them aware of one another in such strange ways. \u201cIt\u2019s Paracelsus. I just received your message. Has there been any word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing yet. Is your line secure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>Quickly the man he knew as Vulcan related the details of Aphrodite\u2019s disappearance. The last time she had e-mailed Taske, she had told him that she was relocating to Boston, and would be out of touch for a week. Now she had gone missing for two.</p><p>\u201cWhy was she in New York City?\u201d he asked when Vulcan had finished.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Vulcan admitted. \u201cMaybe she wanted to see her adoptive family. I know she was raised there.\u201d</p><p>Taske recalled one late-night IM session, during which Aphrodite had been unusually forthcoming about her youth. \u201cShe would never go back to them voluntarily; she\u2019d live on the streets first. GenHance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to hack into their database, but I haven\u2019t found a way in yet. Our watchers in Atlanta say no new acquisitions have been delivered since we lost Savannah.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cShe left Matthias, and not on entirely good terms. She\u2019s nursing a broken heart.\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cAren\u2019t we all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, it\u2019s possible that she wanted to go off the grid, break all contact with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Aphrodite,\u201d Taske said firmly. \u201cHave you checked the hospitals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m monitoring them daily.\u201d Vulcan sounded bleak. \u201cNo one matching her description has been admitted.\u201d</p><p>That decided matters for him. \u201cI\u2019ll drive down to the city tonight. E-mail me the map with her last known position, a description of her motorcycle, and any photographs of her you may have.\u201d</p><p>Vulcan uttered a dry chuckle. \u201cAnd here I thought I\u2019d have to talk you into going.\u201d His voice grew serious. \u201cWhatever has happened to her, we need to get her back.\u201d</p><p>Taske looked at his gloved hand. \u201cMy friend, I won\u2019t stop searching for her until we do.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Nella Hoff waited until Elliot Kirchner was engrossed in the view from his microscope before she let herself out of the secured analysis lab. Since she\u2019d embarrassed him in front of Jonah Genaro, she\u2019d been expecting some kind of chauvinistic backlash, probably in the form of making her into his personal gofer, but the chief geneticist\u2019s attitude toward her remained seemingly unchanged. That disappointed her, because if he had been angry she might have used that to push him into a sexual encounter. Men loved to fuck women they despised; it was their favorite way of settling accounts and exerting dominance.</p><p>Nella understood because she felt the same way about men. Nothing turned her on more than cutting some self-important prick down to size between her thighs.</p><p>Since Kirchner wasn\u2019t providing her with any new opportunities to get what she wanted, it was time for her to switch to her backup plan. After she visited the restroom to prepare, she took the elevator down to the security section.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Dr. Hoff,\u201d the receptionist greeted her. \u201cHow may I help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to speak with Mr. Delaporte, if he can spare a few moments,\u201d Nella said, glancing at the closed door of his office. \u201cIt\u2019s in regard to some security measures in the lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a moment.\u201d The receptionist picked up her phone, pressed an intercom button, and repeated what Nella had told her. Then she said, \u201cYes, sir. Thank you.\u201d She hung up and smiled as she collected her purse out of her desk drawer. \u201cGo right in, Dr. Hoff.\u201d</p><p>Nella watched the receptionist leave, and then went to Delaporte\u2019s door. She took a moment to fluff her hair before she went in.</p><p>\u201cDr. Hoff.\u201d The chief of security stood up behind his desk. He indicated the chair across from him. \u201cPlease, have a seat.\u201d</p><p>Nella smiled her thanks as she sat in the chair, allowing her skirt to ride up over her knees as she positioned herself. She pretended not to notice in order to give Delaporte an excellent view of her legs up to mid-thigh, where her stockings ended and her garter belt straps began.</p><p>Don Delaporte was one of Jonah Genaro\u2019s most devoted sycophants, and normally Nella would never have trifled with him. He was overweight, mug- faced, and had the personality of a cardboard box. But on her first day at GenHance, when Kirchner had introduced her to him, she noticed a minor shift in his body language. The cues were subtle\u2014slight tension in the shoulders, the droop of his eyelids, the not-too-firm grip he used for their handshake\u2014but they told her he was attracted to her. Later, after some discreet chats with other female employees, she learned that the security chief had a thing for petite women\u2014the smaller, the better.</p><p>\u201cHis last girlfriend was this little Asian girl,\u201d one of the secretaries from accounting told Nella over lunch. \u201cWe thought she was his stepdaughter or something until Dave over in distribution found out she was divorced and had a kid and everything. Do you know what she called him, even in front of other people?\u201d She snickered. \u201cBig Daddy Don.\u201d</p><p>A background check revealed more about Don Delaporte\u2019s predilection for tiny women. The security chief had spent a considerable amount of time of his younger days in the military, and after being discharged had graduated to mercenary work. While his military and civil records were spotless, some of his former colleagues had attested to his fondness for spending his off-duty hours with the very young prostitutes. When he had served in Thailand for a year, he had even installed a teenage whore in his household, telling the other men that she cooked and cleaned for him.</p><p>It seemed \u201cBig Daddy Don\u201d Delaporte liked women whose bodies reminded him of the good old days, when he could buy a night with a tweenie for twenty bucks.</p><p>It sickened Nella to think that the only reason the security chief was drawn to her was because of her girlish build, but it had given her an advantage with him that she might otherwise not have. Now that she had gotten nowhere with Kirchner, she would have to use it.</p><p>\u201cI told your assistant a little white lie,\u201d Nella said, ducking her chin and twisting her fingers together in a nervous fashion. \u201cI\u2019m not here about the security of the lab. I need to report something I saw.\u201d She deftly altered the pitch of her voice so that it sounded younger, more uncertain. \u201cSomething I don\u2019t think I was supposed to see.\u201d</p><p>Delaporte flipped open a notebook and picked up his pen. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to write this down?\u201d She grimaced. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m very conflicted about this. You see, I\u2019ve had some disagreements with the way Dr. Kirchner runs the analysis section. Reporting this, well, it might seem like sour grapes on my part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chairman expects us to do the right thing for the project and the company,\u201d Delaporte told her in a distinctly paternal tone. \u201cIf you\u2019ve seen something that in any way violates the rules or poses a threat to our security, you have to report it, Nella.\u201d</p><p>Now she was Nella instead of Dr. Hoff. Appealing to him like some adolescent twit was working.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She exhaled slowly, tremulously. \u201cThe other night I stayed late to monitor the simulations that were running. I could have checked them in the morning, of course, but with the project at such a crucial stage in development I feel I need to monitor everything closely. I don\u2019t want anything to go wrong.\u201d</p><p>He nodded his approval. \u201cGo on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of it at the time, but Dr. Kirchner was also working late in another part of the lab. I went to get a soda from the lounge and saw him come out of the specimen storage unit.\u201d She bit her lower lip and then released it slowly. \u201cHe had a mobile phone in his hand. He was talking into it to someone.\u201d</p><p>Delaporte\u2019s eyes narrowed. He knew about the new rule against bringing any mobile phones into the building; he had written the memo about it himself. \u201cDo you know who he was speaking to?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cAs soon as I saw what he was doing, I stepped behind a cabinet. I don\u2019t know why, exactly. I think I was afraid. I\u2019ve never been very good at confrontations.\u201d She produced a weak chuckle. \u201cI couldn\u2019t make out much of what he was saying, but he mentioned the transerum and the dominant female Kyndred Mr. Genaro is searching for.\u201d She waited until he finished writing his notes and looked up at her. \u201cI did hear one thing clearly. He said they would be arriving within twelve hours. Mr. Delaporte, he must have been talking about the team that was sent to New York to retrieve that girl.\u201d</p> <p>Delaporte watched her until he realized he was staring, and then returned to his note taking. \u201cHave you seen Dr. Kirchner use this unauthorized mobile phone since that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she conceded in a small, ashamed tone. \u201cBut if he were using it to pass sensitive information to a party outside the company, wouldn\u2019t he have it with him, or keep it someplace safe, like in his office? In the event something important came up and he had to make contact quickly?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d pushed the girlishness a little too hard; Delaporte\u2019s gaze turned harder, less sympathetic. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know, Dr. Hoff. The only way to check would be to search him and his office. I couldn\u2019t do that without Mr. Genaro\u2019s approval. I doubt he would give it based solely on a verbal report from a single witness.\u201d</p><p>He would need more of an incentive to do something on his own, Nella thought, resigned to what would have to come next. She got up from her chair to walk over to the row of eight monitors showing ever-changing views of the interior of the building. \u201cCan you check the security videos for that night? Maybe one of them shows him using the phone.\u201d</p><p>Delaporte joined her, and stood just a little too close for professional courtesy. \u201cWe don\u2019t use cameras in certain portions of the lab. There aren\u2019t any by the specimen storage unit.\u201d</p> <p>Nella turned to him, making sure the front of her body brushed his before she put one hand on his chest. \u201cI\u2019m so worried about the project, Mr. Delaporte.\u201d She lowered her chin and continued in a strained whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s been so difficult for me. You don\u2019t know how cruel and vicious Dr. Kirchner has been. The things he says to me when we\u2019re alone.\u201d She thought of what would happen to her if she failed to get rid of Elliot, and lifted her face so that Delaporte would see the very real fear in her watery eyes. \u201cI feel so powerless, and scared. I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>His arms came up to support her as she collapsed against him. After several wet sobs into his shoulder, she lifted her face to press her cheek against his, and breathed through her mouth so he would feel it against his ear.</p><p>\u201cNella.\u201d Delaporte\u2019s hands shifted, pressing her close instead of simply holding her. The front of his trousers were tented over his erection. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. You don\u2019t have to deal with this alone anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I could depend on you.\u201d She turned her head to give him a kiss on his cheek, and then gasped as he turned his so that their mouths met. \u201cMr. Delaporte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon.\u201d He pulled back and looked into her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d Then he kissed her again.</p><p>She deliberately stiffened before relaxing against him and opening to the wet, hard push of his tongue.</p> <p>Nella faked the moans, the trembling, and the limpness as he moved her over to the couch. She had to keep her eyes closed to endure the groping and sucking that followed, and fantasized about her last lover to stay wet enough to be convincing. But when Delaporte mounted her she discovered the stout, homely looking man sported a beautiful cock the size of a small club, and what he did while he kept her pinned down and impaled on it was better than the efforts of her last five lovers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so big,\u201d she gasped out, not having to fake the tremors of shock she felt every time he thrust. When he finally seated himself to the hairy root, she cried out. \u201cOh, no. No, please, I can\u2019t take it, I can\u2019t.\u201d She thrashed her head from side to side, whimpering as she pushed at his chest. \u201cPlease it\u2019s too big, please stop.\u201d</p><p>Her whining and pleading only spurred him on, as she suspected it would, and he began to grunt with satisfaction as he plowed into her. He was like a screwing machine, she thought, and perspired like a pig, but for some reason his endless, unimaginative pistoning of her and the smack of his sweat-slick body were getting her hot. Then with a genuine squeal of astonishment she had a gushing orgasm, and when she finished he pulled out and ejaculated into a handkerchief he had produced like a magician.</p><p>Nella would never admit it, but she wasn\u2019t entirely faking the tears she burst into a moment later.</p><p>Delaporte tucked in his shirt, zipped up his trousers, and disposed of the handkerchief before he came to kneel beside her. His big, hot hand on her exposed breast made Nella curl over toward him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry if I hurt you,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut you knew what you were doing.\u201d</p><p>Nella shook her head, still trying to play the innocent. Her heart wasn\u2019t in it, however, and she fought a terrible urge to tell him the truth about her and Kirchner and everything she\u2019d done. Suicide, she thought. I might as well stick a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger.</p><p>\u201cNella, look at me.\u201d He waited until she did. \u201cYou\u2019re going to leave early today. Go home, and get some rest.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave.\u201d She sat up, pulling her blouse over her breasts. He\u2019d left suck marks all over them, and seeing the dark pink love bites made her sex clench. She looked up at him. \u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took good care of you, baby.\u201d He brushed her hair back from her face. \u201cJust like I will when I come to your place tonight.\u201d</p><p>Nella pressed her lips together. Having sex with him in the office was a necessary task, but if he came to her apartment, he\u2019d expect to stay. The prospect of being subjected to his battering ram of a penis for an entire night scared the hell out of her. It also thrilled her down to her heels.</p><p>I can work on him, she thought, not caring that she was lying to herself. By tomorrow he\u2019ll do whatever I want. \u201cDo you really want to come over tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. You need me.\u201d He tipped her chin up so that she looked into his eyes before he gave her a firm kiss. \u201cNow be a good girl and go home.\u201d</p><p>Nella straightened her clothes and after glancing one more time at Delaporte, slowly walked out. She went up to the lab to retrieve her purse before checking out.</p><p>On the ride back to her apartment, Nella used the mobile phone in her car to make a call. \u201cI\u2019ll be out of touch until the morning,\u201d she told her employer. When he asked why, she answered honestly. \u201cI have some personal business to attend to.\u201d</p><p>Being unceremoniously dumped in Central Park by Meriden left Rowan sitting with her jaw in her lap for all of five minutes. Whatever she\u2019d said to chase him off, it had worked superbly. She could spend the rest of her day sulking over it\u2014and on some level, probably would\u2014or she could run her errands and enjoy what was left of her day off.</p><p>At her request, Dansant had paid her wages weekly in cash, but refused to take more than a quarter of what she\u2019d earned as repayment for what he\u2019d given Bernard. He also overpaid her, and when she\u2019d tried to argue with him, had told her what he paid the others\u2014more than twice the going wages for line cooks.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you bankrupt?\u201d she demanded, aghast at the staggering sum he laid out for his employees.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019Anges does a good business,\u201d was all he would tell her.</p><p>Later that night she asked Lonzo about just how well the restaurant did every week.</p><p>\u201cOn average we do nine hundred, maybe a thousand,\u201d he said, referring to the number of meals served. \u201cCustomers tip well, too, so the waiters always clean up.\u201d</p><p>She did some rapid calculations in her head. \u201cHoly Hannah. Nine hundred, every week? You sure?\u201d</p><p>He glowered at her. \u201cYou think I can\u2019t count how many dinners I plate every night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I just . . .\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s unbelievable. This place isn\u2019t even that big. I mean, you\u2019d have to sit every table every single night straight through from opening to close.\u201d</p><p>He puffed up a little. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, kid, we do. That and we got the group room filled three, four times a week.\u201d His gaze turned speculative. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking how with the lousy economy, right? Maybe some other places are hurting, but it\u2019s never made a difference to us. People keep coming because they know at D\u2019Anges they\u2019ll have the best meal they\u2019ll eat all year. That\u2019s why you won\u2019t see any prices on the menu, Trick. We don\u2019t need \u2019em. They don\u2019t give a shit what we charge \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>She glanced toward the back stairs. If Dansant was pulling in millions every year from the restaurant\u2014which by her calculations he had to be, even after paying all of his employees and covering the cost of food\u2014he probably didn\u2019t care that she was occupying an apartment he could have rented out.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like this in the beginning, though,\u201d she said to Lonzo. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been. He would have had to make a name for the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was the first chef he hired,\u201d Lonzo told her. \u201cWe had a full house opening night, and since then there hasn\u2019t been an empty table in the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the other reason I keep going to church,\u201d the garde-manger said. \u201cSo I can thank God I didn\u2019t take that other job I was offered at the chophouse over on Columbus. They closed a year after we opened.\u201d</p><p>She decided to go to the public library, where she could use a free-access computer to do some research on her mysterious boss. There was something else she needed to do; she couldn\u2019t remember what it was but she was sure once she was online it would come to her.</p><p>On her way to the library Rowan passed a few shops she remembered from the old days: a secondhand clothes store where she\u2019d traded a couple of shirts for a warm jacket, an old-fashioned candy store that still sold penny candy (the only kind she could afford back then), and a florist that specialized in exotic orchids. She was happy to see that all three were still in business, and even browsed around at the consignment shop for a while. She didn\u2019t precisely need the Mets baseball cap she bought, but it was only a couple of bucks and she was tired of wearing a bandanna at work.</p> <p>She\u2019d didn\u2019t think Stallworth\u2019s would still be in business, but when she came to the block where the old bookshop had been, the old black sign still hung from a bracket above the narrow door. With a grin she stepped inside.</p><p>The shop had originally served as a small printing press before the Civil War. While the original Mr. Stallworth had gone off to fight the Rebs, his wife and young son had kept the business going by buying and selling books. Losing a leg at Gettysburg had finally sent Stallworth back to civilian life, but by then the business had been doing so well he decided to abandon his racks of type and ink for the pleasures of the book trade.</p><p>Together with his son he renovated the shop, installing rows of cedar bookcases and building shelved tables to better display their growing collections. Mrs. Stallworth had already scandalized other neighborhood merchants by having some comfortable armchairs and settees brought from her home to the shop, but she convinced her husband that offering their patrons a place to sit and read would entice them to buy, as would the afternoon tea and cakes she offered for a modest price.</p><p>Over the decades the handmade tables had been replaced with modern display stands, and the antique furn ishings had been traded for more durable seating arrangements, but many of the old books remained where they had been shelved, waiting patiently to be taken home by their next owner.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t carry magazines,\u201d a cranky voice said from the back. \u201cOr cigarettes, gum, or beverages. You can get them at the CVS around the corner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow about Patricia Briggs?\u201d Rowan called back. \u201cI could use a little magic in my life.\u201d</p><p>A wrinkled face framed by a helmet of salt-and-pepper spikes popped into view. \u201cI know you.\u201d The old man wandered out, his arms filled with a stack of leather-bound Dickens volumes. He looked her up and down a few times. \u201cRosie. Rolanda. Roberta. No, that isn\u2019t it.\u201d He frowned, muttering to himself before triumph lit up his face. \u201cRowan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d She grinned. \u201cYour shop is still the coolest place in the city, Mr. Stallworth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only more shared your opinion, my dear.\u201d He set down the books and came to give her a hug. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to see you again.\u201d He stepped back with a new frown. \u201cWhat are you doing in New York? I thought you\u2019d gone off for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind. How\u2019s the book biz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s all about the young vampires.\u201d He sighed. \u201cOne is either Team Edward or Team Jacob, it seems. But I live in hope that chick lit will enjoy a revival.\u201d</p> <p>Rowan chatted with him for a few minutes, and admired wallet photos of his newest grandchildren. He was happy to learn that she was working at D\u2019Anges, but not surprised.</p><p>\u201cI still remember those ginger cookies you would bring for me from the bakery,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so proud of them, and rightfully so. You ruined me for every other cookie on the market, young woman.\u201d His expression turned serious. \u201cA few weeks after you left for the god-forsaken wilds of the South, some men came around the neighborhood. They were asking questions about a runaway girl. They said they were detectives but I did not get the impression they were working for the NYPD. And before you ask, no, I didn\u2019t tell them about you.\u201d</p><p>Rowan felt her stomach twist at this confirmation of her worst fears. \u201cI appreciate that, Mr. Stallworth.\u201d She glanced at one of the display tables, featuring stacks of books for young adults with vampiric-sounding titles. \u201cI am interested in finding some books about vampires, but not the Twilight knockoff stuff. I\u2019d like to see whatever you have that\u2019s nonfiction. Older books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStephen King old, or Bram Stoker old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStoker.\u201d</p><p>He waved for her to follow him into the back of the shop. Once there, he went to a locked, glass- fronted case and pulled out his keys.</p><p>\u201cI had to install this after I caught a girl attempting to shoplift some of the newer volumes. I\u2019m sure she intended to resell them across town; the poor child looked half-starved.\u201d He unlocked the case, opened the doors, and began pointing out shelves. \u201cEarly twentieth century, late nineteenth, early nineteenth, and so on. The oldest volume I have dates back to 1820, but I think it\u2019s utter rubbish so you can have that one half-price.\u201d</p><p>Rowan took in some of the titles. \u201cWow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne must strike while the trend is hot.\u201d He smiled and patted her shoulder. \u201cI have some shelving to do, but call if you need me.\u201d</p><p>From the work she had done researching and compiling books for Matthias, Rowan had a good working knowledge of the subject matter. Most of the twentieth-century books were useless; they\u2019d been inspired by Hollywood\u2019s conception of the vampire. But the older books were more interesting, and ranged from scholarly studies of historic vampirism to histories of blood- rite cultures. She selected several to flip through and began setting aside the ones that looked the most promising.</p><p>It was the circa 1820 book of \u201crubbish\u201d that intrigued her more than any of the others, however. The author had been chronicling the Romantic period in English poetry, and had obtained several letters that had been exchanged by some of the big names of the era. Among them he noticed a series of unusual metaphors and oblique references to a gifted young poet who had died of consumption before his talent had been fully realized, and opinions on later reports that his grave had been robbed.</p><p>We have ascertained through the authorities in Rome that remains were found in the grave, one poet wrote, but some of our friends were present at the exhumation, and they insist that the body was too fresh to belong to our friend. If he has indeed enjoyed the dark resurrection, would not the body in the grave be that of his first victim?</p><p>Rowan suppressed a shudder, added the book to the stack she had assembled, and carried them to the front of the shop. Stallworth joined her there and after casting a jaundiced eye at her selection rang up her purchases.</p><p>\u201cI never imagined you would develop a fascination for the dark kyn,\u201d he said as he bagged the books. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of superstitious nonsense, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut interesting nonsense.\u201d She handed over the cash. \u201cHave you read much about them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as I ever care to. The idea that plague victims in the Dark Ages rose from mass graves as vampires has been around as long as the legends of monsters in Loch Ness and animal attacks that result in one growing fur under the full moon.\u201d He reached under the counter for a book and added it to the stack. \u201cAn advance reading copy of the new Patricia Briggs. No charge,\u201d he added as she pulled out more money. \u201cI\u2019d have never pegged you for a lover of shape-shifter fiction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the only one who gets it right,\u201d she murmured. She looked up quickly. \u201cI mean, I love the way she writes it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you come \u2019round again, I\u2019ll introduce you to her new series about those of the moonstruck and fur persuasion.\u201d He reached across the counter to take her hand. \u201cDo take care, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Thanks, Mr. Stallworth.\u201d She felt an unwelcome but all-too-familiar sensation that had nothing to do with fur or the moon. With an effort she controlled the sudden urge to change. \u201cSay hi to your wife for me.\u201d</p><p>As she left the bookshop, Rowan felt an odd sensation, and looked over her shoulder. She didn\u2019t see any familiar faces among the people walking around the shops, but that combined with the passage she\u2019d read from the old book and what Stallworth had told her gave her the creeps. She gave up on the plan to visit the library and began walking back to the restaurant.</p><p>The man she hadn\u2019t seen waited until she disappeared from view, and then walked up to the bookshop door and let himself in.</p><p>PART THREE</p><p>Trouvaille</p><p>September 29, 2008</p><p>Tanglewood Middle School</p><p>Biology Class</p><p>Mrs. Withers\u2014Period Four</p><p>Total Makeover: How Recombinant DNA by</p><p>Nonbacterial Introduction Might Make Us All</p><p>Supermodels Someday</p><p>A Science Fair Project Proposal by Tiffany</p><p>Angela Ephram</p><p>My biology project for the school science fair this year is about recombinant DNA, and how someday doctors might be able to use it so that anyone who wants to improve their looks can, even if they want a total body makeover so that they can become as beautiful as a supermodel.</p><p>Recombinant DNA is already made in three ways. They are Phage Introduction, Bacterial, and Non-Bacterial Transformation. The bacterial and phage processes require alteration of the original DNA with things like restriction enzymes and antibiotic markers. New DNA is introduced which is designed to repair the existing, altered DNA while resequencing it. I would research one of these methods, but after having strep throat four times this year my parents don\u2019t want me deliberately exposing myself to germs. For that reason I\u2019m making my project about Non-Bacterial Introduction.</p><p>To make this type of rDNA (recombinant DNA) no germs are necessary. A doctor can give you a microinjection that adds new DNA to your preexisting DNA and the new genes take over and replace the sequences in your DNA that are not wanted anymore. Some scientists also invented a new process of introducing the new DNA with biolistics, or tiny particles of gold or tungsten that are coated with the new DNA, which is shot into the patient\u2019s body like a thousand tiny bullets. They call that high-velocity microprojectile bombardment, but it doesn\u2019t hurt the patient and delivers the new DNA in the same way the microinjection method does. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>None of these methods work very well unless some other things happen at the same time. Once the rDNA is inside the patient, the preexisting DNA has to receive some signals from the body to convince it to accept the new genes. The signals are sent by expression vectors, and they have to understand and accept the new DNA before they\u2019ll send the signals for the body to do the same. Some scientists believe the body has to have a strong reason before it will accept the rDNA, such as a terminal disease or a lethal injury.</p><p>rDNA is becoming important to the human race because of its many valuable uses. For example, scientists are using it to grow crops that are more weather-resistant, and to manufacture medicines to help patients who have serious diseases like diabetes and hemophilia. A company called GenHance has been working on creating rDNA that will stop babies from being born with serious defects and life- threatening conditions. On the GenHance Web site they have an entire section about how rDNA should not be used for frivolous or unnecessary changes to human DNA, such as altering our outward appearance, but I think how people feel about themselves can be just as important as good health.</p><p>I\u2019ve had to wear braces for two years now, and they\u2019re very uncomfortable. I can hardly eat anything I like. If I could use rDNA to change the genes that gave me crooked teeth, and replace them with genes for straight teeth, I wouldn\u2019t have to wear them until the middle of high school. I think it would also be much cheaper for my parents to pay for a single shot of rDNA instead of two years of visits to the orthodontist every nine weeks.</p> <p>The reason I decided to use supermodels as part of my project is because almost every plain girl I know dreams about being beautiful. There are also some girls like my best friend Gemma who want to work as supermodels when they grow up. Gemma isn\u2019t very tall, and she has a large birthmark on her face. She\u2019s going to ask her mom if she can have laser surgery as a graduation present, but wouldn\u2019t it be better for her if a single injection could make her taller and take away her birthmark? If science can make our lives better, then why shouldn\u2019t Gemma have a chance to improve her appearance so she can follow her dream?</p><p>I plan to use a Photoshop program to demonstrate how rDNA might transform people\u2019s appearance for the better. I also plan to research the different types of particles that can be used to deliver the rDNA to the body and will show samples of the metals in my display.</p><p>I believe that rDNA can be used safely, not just to make sick people better, but to help people save time and money while trying to improve their appearance, and feel better about themselves. I\u2019m really excited about this project, so I hope you will approve my proposal and let me show the world that GenHance is wrong.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>Taire woke from the nightmare of the dark room with a shriek, and as soon as she realized where she was she pressed a hand over her mouth to smother the sounds until they stopped. She lay still and listened until the silence reassured her that no one was outside the closet. No one had heard; no one knew she was here.</p> <p>A few months ago she would have spent the next hour crying into her pillow, but she had neither the tears nor the time to wallow in her misery. The sun was setting\u2014she could always feel it, even in here\u2014and she had to get up and get moving.</p><p>One of the hardest things for her to do was one of the simplest tasks in life, one she\u2019d never thought about before she\u2019d left home: bathing. The hotel had no running water, and there was no place in the city that did that would allow a runaway to make use of their facilities. Using the sinks in one of the few public restrooms to wash more than her hands was too embarrassing; Taire had tried it once and some tourist woman had actually tried to take a picture of her. A few of the kids she\u2019d met on the streets sometimes used public fountains for a quick soak in their clothes during the summer nights\u2014occasionally getting themselves arrested in the process\u2014but Taire couldn\u2019t risk it. After a month of being unable to wash herself properly, she\u2019d started to bring her own water into the hotel, one bottle at a time.</p><p>Everyone drank bottled water these days, so it had been easy to scrounge enough bottles out of trash cans around the city. Every night she filled three of them at a public water fountain, tucked them in the pockets of her jacket, and carried them back to her place, where she stored them in a room on the first floor. Once she had collected twenty-one filled bottles, she had enough to bathe.</p><p>Taire uncapped the bottles and lined them up beside the tub in the first- floor room where she took her baths. After she cranked her flashlight and turned it on, she set it on the sink with the beam aimed at the tub. As she stripped off her clothes, the frigid air made her shiver, and the cold water in the bottles didn\u2019t help. She\u2019d learned to keep them covered with a mound of towels to prevent them from freezing solid, but it didn\u2019t warm the water any.</p><p>She stepped into the tub and took the first bottle, pouring it slowly over her head while working her fingers through her hair. The water was so cold it made her gasp, but after the second bottle it wasn\u2019t as much of a shock to her skin. It took another two bottles to get her body wet, and then she went to work with a mini bottle of shampoo and a thin bar of soap she\u2019d scrounged from one of the housekeeping carts. When she was completely soaped down, she began the laborious process of rinsing off, one bottle of water at a time.</p><p>The first time she\u2019d tried it she hadn\u2019t brought enough water, and had been forced to walk around for another day with sticky hair before she\u2019d collected enough bottles to rinse it clean. Now she had it down to a science, and by the time she used the last of her water she was soap and shampoo free.</p> <p>She wrapped a hotel towel around her wet head and used another to dry off and rub some warmth back into her shivering limbs. Once dry, she changed into her cleanest set of clothes\u2014doing her version of laundry required so much water that she only washed her clothes when she couldn\u2019t stand the smell of them anymore\u2014and rubbed her hair briskly until it was a damp tangle.</p><p>The other drawback to bathing was that she had to wait for an hour or so until her hair air-dried before she went outside. The temperatures in November rarely rose above freezing, and while she never got sick, going out with wet hair caused her to lose too much body heat, and her fingers and toes would go numb. Once she had wiped out the tub with the damp towels she\u2019d used, and hid her empty water bottles on the top shelf of the room\u2019s closet, she carried the wet towels back to her room, where she folded and hung them on the bathroom rack to dry.</p><p>Taire liked to read, but searching the hotel rooms had only turned up a single book some guest had left behind. Since she couldn\u2019t afford to buy more she had to read that or the Gideon Bible in the nightstand. She settled into her closet, fished the book out of her clothes bag, cranked her flashlight for a few minutes, switched it on, and began to read chapter one.</p><p>There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner (Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further outdoor exercise was now out of the question.</p><p>I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.</p><p>Taire had mixed feelings about the book. It was depressing, filled with bad things that happened for no good reason, and the characters often made no sense. She also didn\u2019t think even back in those days that a ten-year-old girl talked that way. But she knew how the orphaned Jane felt, first being dumped on relatives who hadn\u2019t wanted her, and then being shipped off to that horrible school, where she was abused and the only friend she made ended up dying.</p><p>At least Jane had Helen Burns. Taire didn\u2019t have anyone. And there are worse things than being plain.</p><p>Father knew about Taire\u2019s physical inferiority, of course, but he had believed she could overcome her flaws. She\u2019d always gone along with whatever he had wanted changed because she knew he was trying to make her a better person. It hadn\u2019t been easy; every year there had been another operation, sometimes two or three, and he would never come to see her until the bruising had disappeared. Then he would visit her in the golden room, and he would watch her and smile, nodding every time she did something right. He would be in such a good mood that he would pretend not to notice any of her mistakes.</p> <p>You\u2019re doing well, child, was what he\u2019d usually say. Once in a great while he would point out something specific and tell her That\u2019s almost exactly as it should be. Those were the best times with Father, when she had pleased him enough for him to mention it. Then she would have four or five or even as much as six months of freedom from the dark room.</p><p>It was the freedom that always spoiled things for her; Taire could see that now. She would get used to being able to move around the house, and have her meals downstairs, and go to the library whenever she wanted something to read. The servants would smile at her and do little things for her, like giving her a snack in the kitchen or letting her play with the grand piano in the music room. When Father was pleased, everyone was happy.</p><p>That was when Taire would forget, and do something that was not allowed, and even if no one had seen her do it, somehow Father always knew.</p><p>Her nanny would take her to him, and he would make her confess to whatever wrong she had done. Taire would cry as she admitted to the wrong, and beg him to forgive her, but Father would only nod to the nanny, who would lead her back to the dark room. It was small and dark and empty except for a toilet in the corner and a sleeping bag on the floor. It also had no windows, and when Taire was locked in she felt as if she had gone blind, and screamed and cried for hours. Only when she stopped making noise would someone push a tray of food and a cup of water through the slot in the door three times a day. Unless she pushed the tray and cup back through the slot, the servants wouldn\u2019t bring her anything else to eat or drink.</p><p>No one came to see her when she was staying in the dark room. Once a week they put something in her food that made her go to sleep, and when she woke she would be dizzy but clean and wearing new clothes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Taire sometimes tried to count the meals to see how long Father kept her in the dark room, but she always lost count after two weeks. Every time he sent her there, it felt like forever.</p><p>Father never spoke of the time she spent there, and the servants pretended like the dark room didn\u2019t exist. When Taire was sent there, it was like she didn\u2019t exist. Sometimes, after she had been locked in for a while, she wondered if they would ever forget about her. Every food tray was a relief, something that brought her one meal closer to freedom.</p><p>Then came the wonderful day when the door would be unlocked, and her nanny would take her to the golden room, where she would give her a long bath, and wash her hair, and dress her in her prettiest clothes. It took some time for Taire\u2019s eyes to adjust to the light, and she was often stiff and sore from sleeping on the hard floor of the dark room. But the bath helped, and once her eyes adjusted to the light, she felt very peaceful.</p> <p>Before her nanny took her down to the dining room, she would always tell her the same thing: Show your father you can be good this time. And Taire would be very good, for days and weeks and months, even when the doctors came, before freedom made her forget again and she had to stay in the dark room again.</p><p>Taire understood why she needed to be punished\u2014Father wanted her to have time to think and remember how much he did for her, so she would control herself\u2014but the last time she did something wrong everything had changed. She still wasn\u2019t sure what her mistake was, because she had been out of the dark room for only a few weeks, and she had been thinking all the time about what she was doing and not losing control. Then Father had come to her, had walked right into the golden room where they were always happy together, but he had shouted at her. Taire had never before seen her father so angry. She had never once heard him raise his voice to her or anyone.</p><p>\u201cYou worthless, stupid girl. Get up.\u201d When Taire had scrambled to her feet, Father had grabbed the clothes her nanny had laid out for her and flung them at her. \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Get dressed.\u201d</p><p>In her terror she had fumbled, unable to make the buttons go in the holes, but all Father had done was drag her from the room with her clothes hanging open. One of his men stood waiting in the hall, and Father had pushed Taire at him.</p><p>\u201cTake her,\u201d Father said, his voice harsh. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you do, just get rid of her.\u201d</p> <p>Taire had cried out, fighting the man\u2019s grip on her arms as she pleaded to stay. \u201cFather, what did I do? Father, please, don\u2019t send me away. I\u2019ll be good.\u201d</p><p>He had strode away without looking back, and the man had taken her down the back stairs.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you give me any shit, kid,\u201d he said when she\u2019d tried to pull free in the garage. He\u2019d dragged her over to one of Father\u2019s cars, the one the men used at night.</p><p>Taire didn\u2019t realize he meant to put her inside until he opened the door. \u201cI can\u2019t go with you.\u201d She\u2019d never left the house. She wasn\u2019t allowed to, not even on the window balconies. \u201cLet me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna take a little ride out to the woods,\u201d the man said. \u201cYou\u2019ll like it. It\u2019s real pretty out there. You might see some deer.\u201d Then he licked his lips and stared at her front. \u201cSo be nice.\u201d</p><p>As he tried to push her into the car, his jacket fell open and Taire saw the holster and gun he wore. He was one of Father\u2019s guards. The only people they took away never came back.</p> <p>Taire didn\u2019t want to think about what she had done then. She hadn\u2019t meant to; she hadn\u2019t even been thinking about it. She\u2019d been a good girl and controlled it because that was the biggest mistake, something Father told her she could never do again or she would have to leave him forever.</p><p>When it stopped\u2014when she stopped\u2014she looked down and saw the dirt and blood all over her clothes. The man lay across the garage his body all wrong, his face smashed flat. Father\u2019s car was ruined, too.</p><p>She\u2019d done this. All of this.</p><p>Taire heard men shouting on the other side of the door leading into the house, and backed away into the door leading to the street outside. She\u2019d pressed the button to make it go up, but it was bent in the middle and stopped halfway, and she\u2019d had to crawl under it.</p><p>She didn\u2019t remember much after that. She\u2019d run from Father\u2019s house, following the sidewalks and banging into people. They\u2019d yelled at her, and one woman had hit Taire with her purse. She hadn\u2019t stopped until she reached the big park and found a place to hide in the bushes. She\u2019d crawled into them and stayed there for a long, long time.</p><p>Taire had never tried to go back alone. She knew what she had done was a terrible thing, and if she tried to see Father by herself he would send her away, or maybe even put her in the dark room and forget about her. She had to make up for what she had done to the man and his car, and the only way she knew was to bring him what he wanted most in the world.</p><p>He didn\u2019t think she knew anything about the time before she had come to live with him, but she had found the hidden journal when she had been playing in the golden room. She\u2019d read it, every page of it, and learned all about the secrets he had been keeping. She\u2019d always sensed she wasn\u2019t the first one in his heart, but the journal told her exactly who was. All she had to do was give back to Father what he had lost.</p><p>His beloved one.</p> <p>Taire held the book against her heart, hugging it like a bandage over the pain throbbing inside. His beloved one was the key to everything, and bringing her back was the only way for Taire to go home. When she did, then Father would be happy again. He\u2019d know how much Taire loved him, and he would let her stay, and they would be a family. No one else could do this for him except Taire, because even Father didn\u2019t know what his beloved one looked like now.</p><p>Only Taire did.</p><p>Rowan got back to the restaurant an hour before opening, and hauled her purchases upstairs to put them away. Along with the books she\u2019d bought at Stallworth\u2019s, she\u2019d picked up some boxes of cereal, milk, eggs, bananas, some multigrain bread and a huge jar of peanut butter with which to make sandwiches. She also found some nutritional protein bars she liked that didn\u2019t taste like ground-up vitamins; they\u2019d come in handy when she took her mid-shift break.</p><p>I\u2019d better not let Dansant see the peanut butter, or he might fire me.</p><p>She showered, changed, and sat down to watch the evening news for as long as she could stay awake, which was about five minutes\u2019 worth. Sometime after midnight she woke to an infomercial for a set of vegetable peelers and shut it off. Her stomach persuaded her to have a banana before she went to bed, and then it wanted a peanut butter sandwich. By the time Rowan had quieted the beast she was wide-awake.</p><p>This is what I get for working nights.</p><p>She started reading one of her new books, a study on the blood rituals of ancient South American cultures. The author, an anthropologist who had spent several years working at a number of archaeological sites, had photographed a series of unusual carvings at one ancient temple that seemed to indicate vampirism had been introduced to one society about the time the Europeans began arriving in the New World. Rowan tried to focus, but even the ghastly description of how high priests had once drunk blood from still-beating hearts they had carved out of the chests of living victims couldn\u2019t hold her attention.</p><p>Finally she slammed the book shut and shoved it away. Meriden had really done a number on her head, and pretending like he hadn\u2019t was stupid.</p><p>What did I say that pissed him off? Something about how fast he was moving. Maybe he\u2019d expected her to fall all over him instead. She\u2019d spent the better part of the day with him and the man was still a complete question mark.</p><p>She heard footsteps climbing the stairs, and got up and walked over to the door to listen. Keys jangled, a lock turned, and the door across from hers opened and closed.</p><p>So he was home for the night. She opened her door to glance downstairs, and saw that the kitchen was empty and dark. Everyone had left, and it was just her and her unfriendly neighbor.</p><p>He\u2019s probably tired, she thought as she looked at his door. He\u2019ll want to shower and go to bed, and I should let him. Whatever happened in the park is his problem, not mine.</p><p>She was tiptoeing around him again, this time in her head.</p><p>Rowan stepped out onto the landing, and as soon as she closed her door Meriden\u2019s opened. He didn\u2019t come out, but propped an arm against the frame and looked at her. If he\u2019d worn a sign around his neck, Rowan imagined it would have read, ABANDON HOPE, ALL YE WHO FUCK WITH ME.</p><p>\u201cSWAT is on their way,\u201d she said casually, \u201cbut they\u2019ll probably get hung up in the late traffic over in the theater district.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her and went back inside his apartment. He didn\u2019t bother to close the door, however, and Rowan considered that the equivalent of an invitation to follow him.</p><p>Meriden\u2019s apartment was slightly larger than hers, but her view was better. From the look of the interior, which was half-Spartan, half-machine-shop-leftovers, he\u2019d had the Army Corps of Engineers in to decorate the place. But the surfaces were clean and uncluttered, and there was the same sort of defined order she\u2019d noticed at his garage.</p><p>He watched her look. \u201cCuriosity satisfied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d She was going to burn in hell for all the lies she told. \u201cYou just get off work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He opened the fridge, took out two beers, and handed her one. \u201cSit down.\u201d</p><p>Her choices were the couch, which looked too comfortable, and a loveseat, which she didn\u2019t want to try out at all. She pulled out one of the chairs of his dining set, which looked like he\u2019d stolen it from a hunting lodge, turned it around, and straddled the red-and-black plaid cushion.</p><p>Meriden didn\u2019t sit. He leaned, this time with his back against the kitchen counter.</p><p>Rowan figured she had the time it would take her to drink the beer before he kicked her out, which might be enough. \u201cToday, in the park, what did I say to piss you off?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, drank a little, and looked at a crack in the floor tile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The hostility wasn\u2019t there, but neither was the ease. Rowan\u2019s intimate knowledge of the male psyche could fill maybe half a thimble, but Meriden was using the nonverbal tough guy act to cover something else.</p><p>Something, she suspected, that had nothing at all to do with her. \u201cIf you want me to come in, Sean, you have to open more than a beer.\u201d</p><p>He shifted his weight, and just when she thought he was going to tell her to get out, he came over and sat beside her at the table.</p> <p>\u201cI lost someone close in a fire once,\u201d he said bluntly. \u201cLong time ago. It screwed me up for a while.\u201d He thumbed an edge of the label on his beer. \u201cStill does.\u201d</p><p>The rawness of his voice told her not to ask who or how. \u201cI just walked away from the only guy I\u2019ve ever loved,\u201d she heard herself say, just as abruptly. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know, and then he found someone else.\u201d She paused to take a drink. \u201cMy best friend, as it happens.\u201d</p><p>Sean frowned. \u201cShe know you loved him?\u201d When Rowan shook her head, he let out his breath. \u201cShit. You don\u2019t do the girl thing.\u201d</p><p>She let a little of her bitterness show through in her smile. \u201cNot even when I should.\u201d</p><p>They sat together in a companionable silence, during which Rowan wondered why she felt so comfortable with him. Old wounds and mutual states of general hostility toward the world aside, she knew almost zero about him, and he about her. After what he\u2019d said about his past, she had no desire to commence excavations. Dansant knew him; maybe she could wheedle a little more information out of him.</p> <p>\u201cYou said you liked working with the Frenchman,\u201d Sean said out of the blue. \u201cSo what\u2019s he like?\u201d</p><p>That was a loaded question. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Okay, I guess. What did you think when you met him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had the pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She blinked. \u201cBut he works downstairs, practically every night. You have to walk through the kitchen to get to the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s always gone by the time I get home from work.\u201d He studied her face. \u201cYou like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave me a job and an apartment for nothing,\u201d she reminded him. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He sounded annoyed. \u201cHe\u2019s French.\u201d</p><p>Like that was an STD. \u201cSo in addition to being a bad-tempered jackass, you\u2019re also a bigot?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like that. \u201cJust answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he like? Well, he\u2019s French\u201d\u2014she glared at him\u2014\u201ctall, dark, gorgeous, talented, wealthy, and kind.\u201d She thought for a moment. \u201cIn fact, if he liked women, he\u2019d be perfect.\u201d</p><p>Meriden actually choked on his beer. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gay.\u201d She watched him as he shot to his feet. \u201cLet me guess. You don\u2019t like gay men, either. Tell me something, Meriden. Is there anyone you do like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a fairy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use stupid fucking slurs,\u201d she snapped. \u201cHe told me he lives with a guy. He called him his partner\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Meriden suddenly laughed, but it wasn\u2019t a pleasant sound. \u201cYeah, he does. But the partner is straight.\u201d</p><p>Now she was lost again. \u201cYou said that you\u2019ve never met Dansant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the partner.\u201d He picked up his beer, walked to the window, and braced a forearm against the upper frame. \u201cSo now that you know he\u2019s straight, you can do him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do him?\u201d It was her turn to laugh. \u201cSure. I\u2019ll jump him behind the meat cooler right after my next shift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a good time.\u201d He sounded bored.</p><p>Rowan\u2019s confusion evaporated. There was no reason for her to stay and listen to his garbage. He\u2019d done her a favor, telling her that Dansant was straight. Maybe. She still couldn\u2019t see how he\u2019d come to that conclusion, especially if Dansant and his partner were being discreet.</p><p>Figuring she\u2019d give it one more shot, she put down her beer, rose, and walked to stand beside him at the window. Below them, the streets were almost empty, with only a couple of late-nighters walking in pairs.</p><p>\u201cDansant\u2019s okay. He\u2019s a decent man, a wizard in the kitchen, and I like him a lot. The tall, dark, and gorgeous stuff still stands.\u201d She hesitated, trying to put into words how she felt. \u201cHe helped me when he didn\u2019t have to. I don\u2019t just owe him for bailing me out of a tough spot. He\u2019s kind of restored my faith in other people, and showed me that there are some decent ones out here.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head. \u201cAre you going to fuck him?\u201d</p><p>How like a man, to reduce it all to sex. \u201cAside from that being none of your goddamn business whatsoever? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Now he sounded angry, which threw her off again. \u201cIn case you forgot, I do work for the man. Sleeping with your boss is about as smart as stealing from him. Dansant\u2019s also way out of my league.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He was jealous. Rowan almost laughed out loud. Jealous over her. \u201cThen maybe I\u2019m out of yours, Sean.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never uttered a better exit line in her life, and as she walked across the landing to her apartment, it worked wonders for her battered pride. But as she dropped into bed, Rowan realized something she hadn\u2019t before: The two men in her life she was most attracted to had suddenly become attainable. And if she had to pick between them, she\u2019d be in real trouble.</p><p>For now it seemed she wanted Sean as much as she wanted Dansant.</p><p>Gay. She thought the Frenchman was gay. Jesus fucking Christ.</p><p>Meriden grabbed his jacket, stomped downstairs, and unlocked Dansant\u2019s office. After two arguments with Rowan in one day he was in the mood to trash the place, but settled for grabbing a Sharpie out of a drawer and leaving a few choice thoughts on the French fuck\u2019s desk blotter. And oops, did his elbow knock over a nice neat pile of invoices so that they scattered all over the floor? Apparently it did.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t go back upstairs until he cooled down, not when all that stood between him and Rowan was a bunch of stupid misunderstandings and a flimsy door. She was a smart-mouthed, demanding bitch. And she was the hottest damn woman he\u2019d ever wanted to nail on the nearest flat surface.</p><p>He drove down to the river, and parked where he could watch the tugs. There were five phone numbers flashing in the back of his head; all of them belonging to women who would welcome him at their door no matter what hour he knocked. He could make one phone call and be naked between a soft pair of thighs in fifteen minutes. He didn\u2019t owe Rowan Dietrich a goddamn thing.</p><p>Want to be my baby daddy?</p><p>Meriden swore and put the car in gear, squealing his tires as he reversed and took off. He drove the streets around the coffee shop for an hour, looking for solitary kids who fit Alana\u2019s description. But the night was cold, and the only people on the street were the ones who were paid to be there.</p><p>He spotted a waste management truck parked at a corner, and pulled up behind them. The two men dumping cans in the back eyed him but didn\u2019t stop working.</p><p>\u201cTalk to you for a sec?\u201d Meriden called out to the bigger of the pair as he approached.</p><p>\u201cFree country,\u201d the man replied. He sounded casual, but he held on to the empty can he\u2019d carried from the curb, and his left hand dove into his jacket pocket, where Meriden was sure he\u2019d tucked a handgun or a shiv.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a P.I.,\u201d he told him, taking out his credentials and holding them out until the man got a good look at them. \u201cHave you seen a girl about sixteen years old, short, thin, blond curly hair, blue eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I have. Runaway kid?\u201d</p><p>Meriden nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for her folks. I got a daughter that age,\u201d he added for clarification. \u201cI\u2019d tear apart the city with my hands if she were living out here.\u201d</p><p>Meriden shared a grim smile with him. \u201cYou notice anyplace in the neighborhood where kids like to flop regularly?\u201d</p><p>The man shook his head and turned to his partner. \u201cHey, Frankie, you said you saw some kid crawling out a boarded-up place last week when you were working Cleaver\u2019s route. Where was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, shit.\u201d The smaller man\u2019s face scrunched as he thought. \u201cMaybe over on Fifty-seventh. Not my route,\u201d he explained to Meriden. \u201cI was filling in for another guy.\u201d</p><p>He handed both men a business card. \u201cIf you spot her and get a chance, give me a call. Her father just wants her home safe.\u201d</p><p>The men agreed, and then finished with their load and moved down the block.</p><p>Meriden drove over to Fifty-seventh Street, but two slow passes didn\u2019t turn up any buildings with boarded-over entrances. It was a weak lead, but there were only so many buildings in Manhattan that were not being used; any that were empty were slated for renovation or demolition. It made his belly knot to think of a kid like Alana King sleeping in a building that might one day be torn down around her. But at least there was a chance she was sleeping indoors, and he wouldn\u2019t find her body in some alley, frozen stiff from falling asleep on an icy night.</p><p>He also wondered why she had run. He knew from her file that she had some mental problems, but being Gerald King\u2019s daughter meant she would have lived a very privileged life. King was a sick, twisted fuck, but from the way he talked about Alana, Meriden had no doubt that he loved her. Enough to kill for her.</p><p>So why had she run to the streets? What had happened to set her off? And why hadn\u2019t she gone back home?</p><p>Meriden headed over to his garage. He hadn\u2019t yet performed his own background check on Alana King, and maybe it was time that he did.</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>Dansant noticed the change in Rowan almost at once. Before she had been impersonally friendly toward him, treating him no differently than any of the other men when they worked together. She shared her smiles and jokes with him, but she paid more attention to his cooking than his person.</p><p>After so many years of effortlessly drawing women to him like hummingbirds in a flower garden, he found her lack of interest disturbing. Even more puzzling was knowing that she was not indifferent to him. Under his influence, she had responded passionately, beautifully to his touch, and that made her indifference even more of a paradox. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Since coming back to work after her second day off, however, Rowan\u2019s behavior toward him had changed. Now he felt her watching him constantly, not to observe his cooking but to study him. Her easy, friendly manner had been replaced by a silent, edgy tension that seemed to hum in the air between them whenever she drew close. She had also begun to avoid even the slightest physical contact with him.</p><p>Dansant waited patiently for her to come to him with whatever was causing her discomfort, but after a week passed with no change in her demeanor he realized she had no intention of confiding in him. Perhaps it was the atmosphere of the kitchen, or the presence of the other men, but whatever the cause he decided he would have to be the one to broach the subject.</p><p>The only time they were alone was when he called her into his office to pay her for the week, so when she came in he asked her to close the door and sit down.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, boss?\u201d she asked as she perched on the edge of the chair.</p><p>He had debated for days whether to bring her under his influence again to compel the truth from her, but after recalling the explosive moments they\u2019d shared in the storeroom he had decided against it.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow is your night off,\u201d he said. \u201cHave you made any plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to do some shopping, but that\u2019s all.\u201d She frowned. \u201cDo you need me to work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that is not why I asked.\u201d He produced a pair of tickets a grateful patron had given him after he had hosted her thirtieth anniversary dinner. \u201cI am going to the opera tomorrow night, and I need an escort. I was wondering if you would accompany me.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him. \u201cYou want me to go to the opera with you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI would very much enjoy that, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, uh, flattered, but I can\u2019t.\u201d She rose to her feet. \u201cThanks for asking, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you had no plans,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d She stuffed her wages in her pocket. \u201cI don\u2019t have opera clothes, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He had forgotten about the limitations of her wardrobe. \u201cIf you had them, would you go with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d She looked bewildered. \u201cI\u2019m not what you\u2019d call the opera type, and why are you asking me? Shouldn\u2019t you take your, ah, current love interest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry to say there is no one interested in my love at present.\u201d He tried to look humble. \u201cIf you do not go with me, I must give these tickets to someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Lonzo and his wife would love to go the opera,\u201d Rowan assured him. \u201cHe\u2019s always singing that song from the Boeing opera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLa Boh\u00e8me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that one.\u201d She started for the door, but stopped when he said her name and turned around. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on dates, Dansant. Me being an employee and all, it would get messy.\u201d</p><p>He got up and came around the desk. \u201cDo you want me to fire you?\u201d</p><p>That startled a laugh out of her. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will not be messy.\u201d He took her hands in his. \u201cIt will be you and me at the opera, and you will enjoy it, I promise.\u201d Her fingers were so tense they felt like twigs. \u201cPlease, say you will come with me. I will see to the clothes you need\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy me clothes to go to the opera, not on top of everything else.\u201d</p><p>He was tired of her refusing him, especially such a small thing as a gown and a pair of shoes, but to snap at her would only stiffen her resolve. \u201cI can leave the price tags attached and return them the next day, if you like.\u201d</p><p>She grinned up at him. \u201cYou liar. You\u2019d never do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonzo\u2019s wife does,\u201d he told her. \u201cShe even has a trick to keep from getting antiperspirant marks on the inside of the sleeves.\u201d</p><p>She thought for a moment. \u201cAll right, here\u2019s the deal: I\u2019ll go with you, but I buy the opera outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is customary to wear an evening gown,\u201d he warned her.</p><p>\u201cOh, I can do a gown, don\u2019t worry.\u201d She sighed. \u201cJust don\u2019t change your mind between now and tomorrow night, or you will be paying for the opera clothes.\u201d</p><p>They agreed to meet at the front of the restaurant, and the next night Dansant arrived in a taxi to wait for her to appear. Normally he wore his tux to the opera, but in deference to her budget he instead opted to wear one of his more conservative suits.</p><p>\u201cYour girl going to be much longer, Mr. Dansant?\u201d the cabbie asked, eyeing in the rearview mirror the line of cars behind them waiting for the valet spot where he had parked.</p><p>\u201cShe should be out momentarily.\u201d Dansant watched the front doors, and just as he began to worry that Rowan would not appear, a woman in a black gown walked out.</p><p>The dress was a beautiful column of brushed velvet with wide, V-shaped panels of sheer lace placed strategically at her throat, shoulders, and waist. As she stepped across the walk, he saw she wore black velvet platform shoes with black silk flowers blooming above her toes. Her hands and arms were covered by elbow- length black satin gloves. A pillbox hat and half veil covered dark, sultry eyes, while a full red mouth smiled at him as she approached the cab.</p><p>It was Rowan, her curls brushed back and tucked behind her ears, making her look as if she\u2019d just stepped out of a film from the forties.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said as she climbed in. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been waiting long, have you?\u201d</p><p>Dansant breathed in her scent as he took her gloved hand in his. \u201cNot at all. You look . . . incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rented,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAll of it. Even the shoes. Don\u2019t scuff me or I have to pay a damage fee.\u201d</p><p>He found her ingenuity charming. \u201cIs it a costume?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s a place down by the Met that rents out theatrical clothes for parties and auditions and things. Everyone will think I\u2019ve gone retro.\u201d</p><p>The taxi dropped them off at Lincoln Center, where Dansant offered Rowan his arm before they walked inside. He enjoyed the wide-eyed attention she gave everything, from the enormous, exquisite chandeliers to the extravagantly dressed men and women who had come to attend the performance.</p><p>\u201cI forgot to ask you what opera we\u2019re seeing,\u201d she said a little breathlessly as he guided her through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cMadame Butterfly,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you familiar with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She glanced at the cover of her program. \u201cIt\u2019s Japanese?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe story is set in Japan,\u201d he said, \u201cand the main character, Cio-Cio San, is a Japanese woman who falls in love with an American. The opera is performed in Italian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s traditional,\u201d he explained. \u201cPuccini, the composer who wrote it, was Italian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She squared her shoulders. \u201cBring on the butterflies.\u201d</p><p>Dansant suppressed a chuckle as he escorted her to their seats, and showed her the Met titles screen, where an English translation of the opera would be displayed in sync with the performance. The massive gold curtain covering the stage rose a few minutes later, and the first act began.</p><p>Having seen Puccini\u2019s heart-render more times than he could count, Dansant waited until the lights dimmed before he turned his attention to Rowan. She watched the performance with full absorption, glancing now and then at the Met titles screen for a translation before returning her attention to the stage. During the intermission she asked him a dozen questions, which he found as delightful as her reactions to his explanations.</p><p>\u201cSo Pinkerton just goes off and leaves Butterfly with the baby?\u201d Rowan frowned. \u201cHow could he do that when he knew she was pregnant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know yet,\u201d Dansant said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe this.\u201d She folded her arms. \u201cShe\u2019s gorgeous, and in love with him, and she just gave up everything to be with him, and he leaves? Just like that? He\u2019s a moron.\u201d</p><p>Her anger amused him. \u201cIt is a tragedy, Rowan, not a romance novel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m going to cry at the end, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He took her hand in his. \u201cI will be here to comfort you.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a narrow, sideways look, but by then the lights were dimming and the performance continued.</p><p>Dansant sensed the change in her toward the very end of the opera, when the soprano playing Cio-Cio San made her fateful decision and took up her father\u2019s sword. Rowan\u2019s entire body went rigid as the soprano crossed the stage, carrying the sword toward her young son.</p><p>\u201cIs she going to kill him?\u201d she whispered furiously.</p><p>Dansant leaned close to make a joke, and then saw her eyes. \u201cNo, ma m\u00fbre. The boy survives.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the opera drew to its unhappy conclusion, Rowan pulled her hand from his and got up.</p><p>\u201cI have to get out of here.\u201d She didn\u2019t wait for his reply, but darted into the aisle and hurried off toward the lobby.</p><p>Dansant followed, but with the rest of the audience rising to go soon lost sight of her. He made his way impatiently through the throng to the lobby, where he looked at every woman in black, but didn\u2019t see Rowan.</p><p>\u201cMichael?\u201d</p><p>Dansant turned to find his arms filled with a chestnut-haired, petite beauty dressed in a stunning sapphire gown. She had her arms around his neck and her smiling, lovely mouth an inch from his before she froze.</p><p>The soft scent of lavender filled his head, making him smile down at her wide, burnished brown eyes. \u201cI regret to say that I am not your Michael, madam.\u201d He put his hands on her forearms and felt the softness of her thin, pale caramel skin. \u201cBut I think he is a fortunate man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my God.\u201d She blinked twice before she laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d She looked all over his face. \u201cYou could be his twin brother.\u201d Her gaze went to his brow. \u201cExcept for the hair.\u201d As if realizing for the first time what she was doing, she eased away and stepped back. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I really thought . . . what\u2019s your name?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJean-Marc. Enchant\u00e9.\u201d He glanced around her, impatient to find Rowan. \u201cHave you seen a tall dark-haired woman in a black velvet and lace dress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkinny as a rail, cute little hat?\u201d The woman pointed to one of the exit doors. \u201cShe went out through there pretty fast.\u201d As he nodded and made to go around her, she put a hand on his arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t mean to keep you, but are you related to anyone in France? Maybe a family named Cyprien?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon, madam. I have no family. I was un enfant trouv\u00e9.\u201d He kissed the back of her hand. \u201cIf you will excuse me now, I must find my friend.\u201d He strode toward the back entrance.</p> <p>Dr. Alexandra Keller watched the man stride out of the Met with mixed emotions. She had the feeling she had just made a terrible mistake, and not by trying to kiss a complete stranger.</p><p>Whoever he was, Jean- Marc moved quickly, and disappeared from sight a moment later, almost as fast as a Darkyn would. But despite his eerie resemblance to her lover, he didn\u2019t move like Michael Cyprien, and now that she thought about it his eyes had been a much lighter blue.</p><p>Michael Cyprien came to stand beside her. \u201cCh\u00e9rie. Is something the matter?\u201d</p><p>Automatically she reached for his hand as she shook her head. \u201cThat was very weird.\u201d She glanced at him and felt a little embarrassed now. \u201cI just grabbed a strange man and tried to kiss him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d His voice chilled a few degrees. \u201cFor any particular reason?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought he was you.\u201d She turned to him. \u201cMichael, he looked just like you. Same height, same features, same blue eyes . . . same everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is said that we all have a twin somewhere in the world.\u201d He encircled her with his arm. \u201cCome. Phillipe is waiting for us.\u201d</p><p>On the drive back to their suite at the Hilton, Alexandra brooded in silence about the odd encounter at the Met. She was able to picture Jean-Marc\u2019s face clearly, and there was something about it that nagged at her. She was so lost in her thoughts that Michael had to repeat her name three times before she gave him her attention.</p><p>\u201cSorry, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked if you enjoyed the performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt pissed me off,\u201d she admitted. \u201cPinkerton was a jerk. The acoustics were amazing. That fat chick in the fuchsia dress sitting in front of us smelled like bacon. I think she had some in her purse. Michael, are you sure you\u2019re the only Cyprien left?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe last member of my human family died childless in the eighteenth century.\u201d He stroked her cheek. \u201cI am not upset that you tried to kiss another man. I would be only if you had succeeded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you or someone in your family had a kid you didn\u2019t know about?\u201d she persisted. \u201cThat was pretty common back in the day, right?\u201d She made a rolling gesture. \u201cYou meet a pretty milkmaid, have a tumble in the straw, you go your way, she pops out a blue-eyed kid nine months later, and everyone thinks it\u2019s her husband\u2019s or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexandra, I was a warrior-priest,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cWe did not make a habit of tumbling milkmaids. We were too busy slaying Saracens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not everyone in your family worked for God back then.\u201d She searched his face. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is, but I swear, that man is somehow related to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because we have the same color hair, the same physique? As much as I wish to think that I am unique among men, ch\u00e9rie, I fear I am not. I would think that there are many humans in the world with whom I share a resemblance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. The guy was just too perfect. Like a replica. He didn\u2019t just look like you. He was you.\u201d She sat up straight. \u201cOh, shit. Phillipe,\u201d she called out to Cyprien\u2019s seneschal. \u201cTurn the car around and go back to Lincoln Center.\u201d</p><p>Phillipe glanced in the rearview mirror, and when Cyprien nodded moved into a turn lane.</p><p>\u201cIt is unlikely that he will still be there, ch\u00e9rie,\u201d Michael told her.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll get lucky.\u201d She gripped the edge of the seat as she looked out through the windshield at the traffic blocking their way. \u201cCome on, come on.\u201d</p><p>It took some time, but eventually they arrived back at the Met. As soon as Phillipe parked at the curb, Alexandra jumped out of the car and hurried toward the arched windows at the front of the opera house. There were some stragglers still coming out from the performance, but none of them proved to be Jean-Marc or his lady in black.</p><p>Cyprien caught up with her just as she began cursing under her breath. \u201cAlex, what is it?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her fingers to her mouth as she scanned the faces around her one last time. \u201cIt was his face, Michael.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, as you indicated, we seem to share the same one\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d She turned to him and looked at his face, the face she had reconstructed out of a horrific mass of ruined flesh and bone after Michael Cyprien had been beaten and tortured. \u201cI gave you that face, and while it\u2019s very close to the one you were born with, it isn\u2019t the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember that painting that you had Phillipe bring to me in New Orleans? The portrait of you on the horse on the battlefield, all the dead bodies everywhere?\u201d When he nodded, she said, \u201cThat guy Jean- Marc isn\u2019t your twin. He\u2019s a twin of the guy in the painting. He looks exactly as you did before the Brethren fucked up your face.\u201d</p><p>Michael shrugged. \u201cSo he was my twin before I was tortured. What difference does it make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had a little mole riding his jaw here.\u201d She touched the corresponding spot on the side of his face. \u201cExactly where it was in the painting. You don\u2019t have it anymore because when I was rebuilding your jaw I had to put a skin graft there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Michael grew thoughtful. \u201cAn interesting coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe in coincidences,\u201d she told him. \u201cWhen you were captured in Rome, you said that the Brethren beat on you for days before Phillipe got to you.\u201d When he nodded, she asked, \u201cDid they do anything else? Did they bring in a doctor? Did he operate on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They only interrogated me; they . . .\u201d</p><p>He trailed off and rubbed his hand across his face. \u201cThere was a day when a new man came to my cell. I could barely see him but his scent was different. He asked questions like the others, but not about the Darkyn or where they could be found. He wanted to know about my talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, ch\u00e9rie. As with the other interrogators, I told him nothing.\u201d He encircled her waist with his arm. \u201cIt is growing cold. We should return to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure the man didn\u2019t operate on you.\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment. \u201cI was conscious the entire time he was with me. He did not touch me once. He gave up rather sooner than the others had, although I thought he meant to have me taken to the interrogation room. He asked the guard where it was. But then he left and I never saw or smelled him again. Forgive me, but that is all I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t mean to remind you of that shit.\u201d She made a face. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the hotel and I\u2019ll make up for it.\u201d</p><p>Alex said no more about the matter until an hour before dawn, when she and Michael were soaking together in the massive tub in their suite. She was wonderfully exhausted after an extended bout of lovemaking, and happy that she\u2019d agreed to come on this trip with her lover. New York City\u2019s operas might suck, but the shopping was fabulous, and she had spent a considerable amount of time acquiring better equipment for her lab. Although she was no longer seeking a cure for the Darkyn\u2019s blood-dependent immortality, she continued cataloging Kyn blood types and the strains of the pathogen that had infected them. One day she might be able to trace the origins of their condition back to the source of the infection, the progenote that had started it all back in the Dark Ages.</p><p>It was thinking about her work with the blood samples that made Alex catch her breath. She turned around, sloshing water over the side of the tub.</p><p>\u201cAgain, ch\u00e9rie?\u201d Michael looked hopeful.</p><p>She kissed his mouth, but before he could take that to the next level, she eased away. \u201cThat man who came to see you in Rome, the strange one, did he ask you medical questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe sounded like you when you are working in the lab.\u201d He tugged her to him. \u201cDo that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on, baby.\u201d She put her hands on his shoulders. \u201cWhy would the Brethren send a doctor to talk to you? They don\u2019t give prisoners medical treatment. And why would a doctor go to an interrogation room? Not to check the equipment, or to take a few practice swings with the copper pipes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot say.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cHe carried a case with him. I heard glass clinking together when he moved it.\u201d</p><p>She got up out of the tub and reached for their towels. \u201cHow much do you want to bet he was there to take DNA samples?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he did not touch me, Alexandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to. There would have been bits of you left all over that torture chamber.\u201d She went out into their suite and grabbed some clothes from the selection Phillipe had hung in the armoire. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find this Jean- Marc guy,\u201d she said over her shoulder as Michael joined her. \u201cAll I need is a blood sample from him, and then we\u2019ll know if he\u2019s Kyndred or not.\u201d</p><p>Michael pulled on his trousers. \u201cHow do you propose we find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many guys named Jean- Marc do you think bought tickets to the opera tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one, I am sure. Alexandra, forgive me but I do not know how this man could have been made from my DNA.\u201d</p><p>She stopped dressing. \u201cYou need me to explain again the entire process of using vampire DNA to turn humans into Kyndred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it is not that.\u201d He came over to her and began buttoning up her blouse. \u201cI was taken in Rome six years ago. It was the only time I had ever been captured by the Brethren.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and the other humans who were made Kyndred were experimented on when you were children,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cFor the man you met tonight to be my . . . progeny, he would have to have been a young child. No more than six years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d She threw down her jacket, disgusted with herself. \u201cI hate this. I hate not knowing what they\u2019re doing, what they\u2019ve done. . . .\u201d She rubbed her forehead. \u201cAll right, so being Kyndred is off the table\u2014for now,\u201d she added, glaring at him. \u201cWe still need to find him and see if he is the descendant of a Cyprien who wasn\u2019t busy slaying Saracens back in the day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man could be walking around with your human DNA,\u201d she told him. \u201cIf I\u2019m ever going to figure out how the pathogen works, I need to look at both sides of the equation. He may still carry in his body the immunities and genetic anomalies that allowed you to survive the initial infection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. He did not tell you his last name? Did you notice where he was sitting in the auditorium?\u201d After she answered no to both questions, Michael went to the phone and placed a call to one of his human friends in the city, who called back a short time later.</p><p>Michael listened, thanked the caller, and hung up before turning to Alex. \u201cNone of the tickets sold for tonight\u2019s performance were purchased by a man with the Christian name Jean-Marc.\u201d</p><p>Alex swore as she dropped onto the sofa and covered her face with her hands. After she reined in her temper, she looked over her fingertips at Michael. \u201cCan we run a check on guys named Jean-Marc in the city?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course we can.\u201d He sat down beside her. \u201cIt is not a common name, so it should only take a few months, perhaps a year, to interview each Jean-Marc living in the city. Assuming he resides here. Then we can check the Jean-Marcs living in New Jersey, and Washington, and work our way across the ocean to the Jean-Marcs living in France. I believe that will take more time.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cIf I asked you\u2019d do it, too, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Michael smiled and kissed her forehead. \u201cYou have but to say, mon coeur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is where I say \u2018no, that\u2019s okay,\u2019 and I\u2019ll let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He glanced at the pale light coming through the windows, and drew her to her feet. \u201cThis is when you say \u2018I love you,\u2019 take off my clothes, and come to bed with me.\u201d</p><p>Surrendering to the inevitable and the pleasurable, Alexandra did just that. Just before they drifted off into the curious sleep of the Darkyn, she remembered something the man had said to her.</p> <p>\u201cMichael, what does un enfant trouv\u00e9 mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a term used for children who are lost or abandoned, and cannot be returned to their family,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cOrphans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that is not quite the same. An orphan\u2019s parents are dead, but the parents of un enfant trouv\u00e9 are unknown.\u201d He held her close. \u201cI think the word in English is foundling.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Dansant tracked Rowan by her scent, and found her sitting on a bus stop bench some distance away from Lincoln Center. Anger followed his relief as he noticed a group of young men watching her from the opposite street corner, but it dissolved as soon as he saw the tears on her face.</p><p>\u201cI should have listened to you,\u201d he said carefully as he sat down beside her. \u201cWhen you said you were not the opera type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not now, not after that.\u201d She fiddled with one of her gloves. \u201cSorry I ran out on you. I just felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe in that place.\u201d</p> <p>He kept an eye on the group of teenagers watching them as he took out his mobile and called for a cab. \u201cWe will try Broadway next time.\u201d</p><p>She sat back against the hard slats of the bench. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a next time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany, I hope.\u201d He took out his handkerchief, but instead of offering it to her went about drying her tears himself. Oddly, his fiercely independent Rowan didn\u2019t resist. \u201cBut no more tragedies. A comedy, perhaps. Neil Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Butterfly wanted to kill her kid, and just didn\u2019t have the spine to do it?\u201d she asked him suddenly.</p><p>He considered her question even as he wondered what had provoked it. \u201cShe is a passionate character, and her love for Pinkerton drove her to suicide. But her mother\u2019s-love for her child would not have permitted her to harm the boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother\u2019s-love.\u201d She made a contemptuous sound. \u201cI wish I believed in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother must have had her reasons for abandoning you, Rowan. She may have been very young, or had no means to support you. She was probably very frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say she wasn\u2019t young,\u201d Rowan countered. \u201cAnd she had all the means in the world to support me. What if something else frightened her? Something about me. What if she thought I was evil?\u201d She added, \u201cWhat if she was right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy birth mom?\u201d She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen how can you ask these questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d She stood and looked at each end of the street. \u201cWhere is that damn cab? Maybe we should walk back to the Met.\u201d</p><p>Dansant saw that the group of boys had now drifted from their corner across the street and were moving toward them. They moved casually enough, talking among themselves, but apparently with a definite purpose as they drew closer to the bus stop. \u201cI think that would be wise.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately the narrow tailoring of Rowan\u2019s gown didn\u2019t allow her to take her customary long strides, and halfway back to Lincoln Center the group of teenagers caught up with them. Several passed Dansant, and then stopped and turned, sandwiching him and Rowan in the middle of their group.</p><p>\u201cYou got a dollar, pop?\u201d one standing in the middle asked.</p><p>\u201cNice threads,\u201d another one said, this time to Rowan. He reached out to touch her sleeve, and she shifted away. \u201cAw, she don\u2019t like me.\u201d</p><p>Dansant kept his gaze on the one in the middle. \u201cLet us pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPass what? Go?\u201d The boy grinned and held out a hand. \u201cThat\u2019ll cost you a wallet, pal.\u201d</p><p>Another boy came up behind Rowan and tucked his face over her shoulder. \u201cYou for sale, baby, or just for rent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatrol cars come by here every ten minutes after a performance,\u201d she informed the group at large. \u201cLast one I saw was nine minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, those cops, they go for coffee at midnight,\u201d the one in the middle told her. \u201cThey won\u2019t be back on the beat for a half hour.\u201d</p><p>The one behind Rowan snickered. \u201cPlenty of time for us to get to know each other.\u201d He grabbed at her chest from behind, and she drove her elbow into his ribs, whirling around at the same time. He roared with pain, grabbing his midsection with one arm before he lashed out at her with the other, punching her in the face. Her head snapped back, and she rocked on her feet, but stayed upright.</p><p>\u201cRowan.\u201d Dansant saw blood streaming from her nose, and felt the fury spread out inside him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said, curling her fists and moving to stand with her back to his.</p><p>The other boys laughed, and Dansant removed his wallet, holding it out. When the leader of the group tried to take it, he grabbed his wrist with his other hand. \u201cYou and your friends don\u2019t want to harm us.\u201d</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p><p>He sent out his influence in a wide arc, encompassing the group. \u201cYou should forget about this and go back to your place on the corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We should.\u201d The boy\u2019s voice sounded dreamy. \u201cCome on, guys.\u201d</p><p>The other boys followed their leader, and walked out into the street. They stopped only for a car whose driver hit the horn loud and long.</p><p>Dansant turned to Rowan, who was pressing her nose between her fingers. \u201cLet me see.\u201d He cradled her face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s broken.\u201d She held still as he used his handkerchief, this time to mop up the blood on her mouth and chin. \u201cHow did you do that? How did you make them go away like that?\u201d</p><p>The blow to her face had prevented her from falling under his influence, or she might have gone with them. \u201cI asked politely.\u201d</p><p>She took her hand from her face. \u201cThere were ten of them and two of us. Under the circumstances, asking politely doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDansant, don\u2019t snow me. You hypnotized them or something. All of them.\u201d She rubbed her arms. \u201cI could feel it.\u201d</p><p>He seized on what she had said as an explanation. \u201cThe power of suggestion can be quite effective, even on large groups.\u201d A cab stopped at the curb, and he put his arm around her. \u201cNow I suggest we leave.\u201d</p><p>As before, Rowan refused to go to the hospital, dismissing her injury as minor. He considered taking her back to his apartment for the night, but his living situation would raise too many questions. He directed the cabdriver to the restaurant, where he paid him before he escorted Rowan inside.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay with me,\u201d she told him as she went to the rinsing sink and splashed her face with cold water to remove the last traces of blood. \u201cI\u2019ve been popped in the nose plenty of times.\u201d</p><p>He felt a surge of relief as the scent of her blood vanished. \u201cThis is not how I envisioned the end of our evening together.\u201d</p><p>She dried her mouth with a paper towel. \u201cJust what were you envisioning, Jean-Marc? A private tour of my apartment?\u201d</p><p>If only he had the time. \u201cI have already seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d She threw away the crumpled towel and removed her hat, shaking her curls loose around her face. \u201cYou took me to the opera, which I could never afford to do on my own. You chased off those kids, and probably saved me from being gang-raped. You\u2019ve definitely earned it. I\u2019m willing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou are angry and hurt, and I think I am leaving.\u201d He went to her and kissed her brow. \u201cThank you for a mostly lovely evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She put her hand on his arm. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that the way it sounded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t.\u201d He pulled her close, holding her as long as he dared before releasing her. \u201cGood night, Rowan.\u201d</p> <p>Dansant walked to the end of the block before he realized he had left his coat back at the restaurant. Not wishing to disturb his young tenant, he let himself in through the front of the building, where he heard some clattering from the kitchen.</p><p>Dansant went to the pickup window, through which he saw Rowan at Lonzo\u2019s station. She was dicing up a conglomeration of ingredients: zucchini, tomatoes, celery, carrots, new potatoes, garlic, parsley, and fresh thyme. Her hands flew, and her chopping blade made short work of the raw vegetables and herbs. Fascinated, he stood and watched her carry the board over to a deep skillet on one of the cooktop ranges. She took down a squeeze bottle of olive oil from Vince\u2019s speed rack, laced the bottom of the skillet with the golden liquid, and then swept the diced bits from the board into the pan. As she worked the pan, flipping the vegetables with expert rolls of her wrist, she added some scallops, chunks of bass, shrimp, and a squeeze of lemon.</p><p>She cooked so rapidly and proficiently that Dansant hardly knew what to make of it. This was not the bedraggled young woman he had hired out of sympathy; Rowan was an experienced chef. Quite experienced, judging by the delicious scent of the meal she was preparing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s stir-fry, Dansant,\u201d he heard her say as she brought the pan over to the long table where they had their family meal every night. \u201cMy own recipe, if you want to risk it.\u201d</p><p>He went through the swinging doors and stood beside the table. She filled two shallow bowls and handed one to him. \u201cHow long have you been cooking?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike this?\u201d She tilted her head to consider the air above his. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Five, six years.\u201d</p><p>He lifted the bowl to his face and breathed in before inspecting the contents. \u201cI know this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you made it,\u201d she said, \u201cit was pot-au-feu de fruits de mer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I stewed,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cIn a pot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like waiting.\u201d She retrieved a couple of spoons from the drying rack.</p><p>\u201cRowan, you cannot stir-fry pot-au-feu.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said au-feu meant \u2018on the fire.\u2019 That made me think of trying it as a stir-fry.\u201d Her expression changed. \u201cI only borrowed some of the leftover bass, and I bought the rest of the ingredients with my own money. You did say I could use the kitchen after closing.\u201d</p><p>He set the bowl down. \u201cYou did not add clams, mussels, or squid.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t have enough money for them. Maybe next time. Oh, and I didn\u2019t make any of that a\u00efoli for that either. I don\u2019t like garlic in my mayonnaise or mayonnaise in my stir-fry. Chinese five-spice is more my style.\u201d</p><p>Dansant didn\u2019t know whether to applaud or shake her. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you could cook like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have believed me?\u201d Before he could reply, she said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m not formally trained. I\u2019ve read a lot of cookbooks, watched a lot of cooking shows on TV, and just . . . practiced. Kind of like Rachael Ray on a much, much smaller budget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not learn to do this from a cookbook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I watch Food Network.\u201d She sat down. \u201cThis is not as good cold. I speak from experience.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the wall clock, and saw that his time was almost up. \u201cI cannot stay to share your meal. Rowan, when Lonzo comes in tonight, you will give him a message for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d She hunched her shoulders and took a sullen bite of her food. \u201cWhat do you want me to tell him?\u201d</p><p>He rested a hand on her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m promoting you to sous-chef.\u201d</p><p>She stopped chewing, and then swallowed with difficulty. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the basis of what? Watching me throw together one meal? You just said you can\u2019t stir-fry a stew.\u201d She made a dismissive gesture. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>He bent down. \u201cOne wolf recognizes another, Rowan. I always thought there was something familiar about you. Now I know what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this to me.\u201d She rested her forehead against her hand. \u201cI just got these guys used to having me around the kitchen. They\u2019ll never go for it, not in a million years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will do as they\u2019re told.\u201d He gestured toward her meal. \u201cEat. You\u2019re too thin as it is. I will handle the rest.\u201d</p><p>She stared at the bowl, and then him before she rose, carried the food over to the trash bin, and dumped it inside.</p><p>\u201cRowan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need you to handle things for me,\u201d she said as she turned to face him. \u201cI\u2019m not a kid, I\u2019m not your girlfriend, I\u2019m your employee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tomorrow night you will be my sous-chef, or you will find another place of employment,\u201d he snapped back. He immediately felt sorry for issuing the threat, but from the look on her face it was too late to apologize. \u201cUnless you are too afraid. Then you may continue fetching and carrying for the cooks until your debt to me is repaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a sous-chef?\u201d She carried the dishes over to the washer and dropped them into the empty racks. \u201cYou got one.\u201d She went to the stairs and ran up them out of sight.</p><p>Dansant was weary of trying to fathom Rowan\u2019s moods while fighting back his own unfulfilled desires. Silently he climbed the stairs, but when he reached the door of her apartment he heard a low, soft sound coming from behind it. It took a moment for him to recognize it: She was weeping again.</p><p>Tonight a death scene from an opera had reduced her to tears, but then she had been struck in the face and made to bleed and had not uttered so much as a whimper. Now after having a simple argument, she wept as if her heart were breaking. Dansant didn\u2019t understand her as much as he wanted to believe he did.</p><p>What woman took physical abuse without a murmur but ran away from fulfilling her own gifts?</p><p>He had no more time to wrestle with the puzzle that was Rowan. No matter how much he wanted her, he had to gather together all the pieces of her life in order to make sense of it and her. To do otherwise would be not only foolhardy, but dangerous for them both.</p><p>It tore at him to turn away from her door, and what he had to do next filled him with despair. But such was the price of his new life, and the hope that at last he had found the woman who might share it with him.</p><p>Meriden pulled on a pair of jeans and a flannel shirt before he stepped out of his apartment and stood outside Rowan\u2019s door. As soon as he heard her, he reached up to the top of the door frame, took down the spare key Dansant had left there, and let himself in.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t bothered to turn on any lights, so he followed the sound of crying to the source, curled up on the floor beneath the window.</p><p>\u201cRowan.\u201d He scooped her up in his arms, dodging her fist and carrying her back to the big armchair, where he sat down and held her on his lap, turning on the lamp beside the chair to get a look at her.</p><p>She was a mess.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get in?\u201d she demanded, choking out the words. \u201cForget it. Just get out.\u201d She pushed at him. \u201cLet go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot happening, Cupcake.\u201d He held on, letting her struggle until she ran out of steam and went limp. She pressed her face into his shirt as she sobbed, shuddering now and then as she muttered broken, nonsensical phrases.</p><p>Meriden didn\u2019t waste his breath on words of comfort; she was beyond that. Wherever she was, he\u2019d be here when she came back. And gradually she calmed, enough to regain some control of her limbs and the convulsive clutching motions of her hands.</p><p>\u201cIf you say you\u2019re sorry,\u201d he told her when he heard her drag in a deep breath, \u201cI will beat the living shit out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d He tugged her head back so he could see her face. Her nose was more swollen than it should have been, and a small graze marred her right cheekbone. Something roared softly in his head. \u201cWho hit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA kid with nasty hands.\u201d She probed her cheek and the bridge of her nose. \u201cHow bad do I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you went a round with Holyfield.\u201d He turned her face toward the light to check her eye, but it was clear. \u201cSo tell me about this kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a couple of cracked ribs now, courtesy of my elbow.\u201d She met his gaze. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sorry about that, either.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, feeling his rage ease back. \u201cSo what was all this about?\u201d He thumbed some tear trails from her cheek. \u201cPostknockout depression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d She settled back against his chest and sighed. \u201cYou ever get into a street fight? A bad one?\u201d</p><p>He thought of the time he\u2019d gotten jumped outside Clancy\u2019s by a drunken Marine and four of his buddies. \u201cNow and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know how to fight the first time I ran away,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just a little kid, and I only had a couple bucks to my name. I was looking around for someplace where I could buy some food, and these two junkies came out of nowhere. One held me from behind while the other one searched me, and even though they were sick and needed a fix they were so fucking strong, Sean. Desperate strong. They took all the money I had, and when I tried to go after them to get it back, they taught me just how easy ribs crack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing on the street that young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNowhere else to go. It doesn\u2019t matter. They picked me up a couple days later and put me back in foster care.\u201d She knuckled her eye and winced. \u201cHave you seen that girl who\u2019s been hanging around the restaurant at night? About five-four, blond hair, real skinny?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>More than once he\u2019d sensed someone out in the alley, but there wasn\u2019t a backstreet in New York that didn\u2019t host someone who didn\u2019t want to be seen. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her face, but I think I know who you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve taken some food out to her a couple times, and tried to talk to her, but she always takes off.\u201d She plucked at one of the buttons on his shirt. \u201cI think she\u2019s about sixteen, same age I was when I finally ditched the foster care system for good. I want to tell her I know how she feels, maybe help her find a safe place to stay, but she won\u2019t let me get near her. She grabs the food and runs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re helping her by feeding her,\u201d he pointed out.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough. Kid like that, she needs a home, a real bed, clean clothes, and someone to take care of her. Hell, if I thought I could get away with bringing her up here and having her stay with me, I would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019d probably knock you over the head and clean you out while you were unconscious,\u201d he predicted.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d She yawned. \u201cYou should go to bed.\u201d</p><p>She felt good against him, warm and soft, like a long, sleepy cat. \u201cI should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not with me,\u201d she murmured, closing her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping with you, you know.\u201d</p> <p>She was asleep a moment later.</p><p>Meriden sat and held her, content to wait until her breathing slowed and deepened before he lifted her and carried her carefully back to her bed.</p><p>She stirred briefly when he laid her out, but only flung an arm out before she went back to dreamland. Meriden considered curling up beside her for a couple of hours\u2014he could think of some great ways to wake her up in the morning\u2014but reluctantly decided against it. When he had sex with Rowan, which he fully intended to do sometime in the immediate future, he wanted her fully awake, completely willing, and one hundred percent aware of him and what they did to each other.</p><p>He pulled up the linens around her, but when he lifted her arm to tuck it under he saw something dark just above her wrist, too dark to be a bruise. He turned on the lamp beside the bed, angling the shade so the light didn\u2019t shine on her face, and then rolled back her sleeve.</p><p>An intricate, densely inked tat of a black dragon with red eyes stretched from just above her wrist to the inside of her elbow. He put her arm down and tugged the covers away from her to have a look at the other forearm, which sported a mirror image of the same dragon. The light caught something else, a faint patch of glowing blue, and when he checked the other tat he saw the same.</p><p>The black dragons weren\u2019t the first images tattooed on Rowan\u2019s arms. There was something else, an older tat, under each one.</p> <p>She can\u2019t be, he thought, sitting down on the edge of the bed. His weight depressed the mattress, causing Rowan to roll over toward him. He stood up quickly, standing over her for a long moment before he reached into his pocket and took out his mobile phone. After snapping a photo of her face, he turned off the light and left.</p><p>He had no choice. He would have to run her.</p><p>He locked Rowan\u2019s door, pocketed the spare key, and returned to his apartment, where he took out the file on Alana King. Rereading the medical reports didn\u2019t convince him; the color of the tattoos on the girl\u2019s forearms was not listed. They were not described as dragons, either. Everyone had tattoos today; even little old ladies.</p><p>He also didn\u2019t believe that Rowan was only sixteen years old. She might have a young face, but her eyes belonged to someone older, a traveler who had maybe seen too much of the world already. She also had none of the awkwardness of an adolescent girl who had just gone through major body changes. A kid wouldn\u2019t be as at ease as Rowan was in her skin.</p><p>Still, there was a remote chance that he was wrong, and the girl he had to find to save his own life was sleeping across the hall.</p><p>He took the laptop out from his desk and booted it up, accessing a face-morphing program he\u2019d gotten from a medical examiner in exchange for some bodywork on a Dodge Charger the examiner had been lovingly restoring. The program, which was not available commercially, was used by several agencies and organizations involved in missing persons cases. Any photo loaded into the program could be virtually aged to any point in that person\u2019s life, a technique used primarily to help identify children who had gone missing for several years.</p><p>Meriden uploaded the photo he\u2019d taken of Rowan with his phone into the system, and pulled it up alongside the school photo of young Alana King. He saw no resemblance between the two faces, but entered the formula to age-progress Alana King\u2019s features to what they would look like at age sixteen. The little girl blossomed into a pretty teenager, but she still looked nothing like Rowan. He advanced the progression a few more years, and got a look at how Alana would appear as a grown woman, but struck out a third time.</p><p>She could have altered her coloring with hair dye and colored contacts, he thought, and removed the age progressions of Alana, restoring her photo to its original appearance. He then changed Rowan\u2019s hair color to blond and her eye color to blue, and had the program age- regress her one year at a time. Although Rowan grew younger and more childlike with each new regression, she still bore no resemblance to the other girl.</p> <p>Whoever she was, Rowan Dietrich had never been Alana King.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Delaporte drew Nella\u2019s arms from around his neck and got up, taking his pants from where he had draped them over the end of her bed. She had suffered from insomnia most of her life, she\u2019d told him, but after a few hours in his arms she would fall into a deep, unmoving sleep that lasted until her alarm clock went off. Sometimes, she confessed wryly, she would even sleep through that.</p><p>After he checked the living room and kitchen, he unlocked the back sliding door and went out onto the small deck. Stepping outside to call in was an unnecessary precaution\u2014she wouldn\u2019t rouse unless he shook her\u2014but Delaporte didn\u2019t care to be anywhere near his girlfriend when he spoke to Genaro.</p><p>His girlfriend. He lit a cigarette, inhaling deeply. Nella Hoff had several PhDs, all of them in subjects he didn\u2019t understand and never would. He liked that she never referred to her education or his lack of it. It would have been much harder to be with her if she\u2019d been a snob.</p><p>He dialed Genaro\u2019s private line, which Genaro answered at once.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d the chairman said. \u201cWhat is your status?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve completed a sweep of the apartment, but she isn\u2019t keeping anything here,\u201d he said. \u201cThe phone she planted on Kirchner was a throwaway paid for with cash, so there won\u2019t be any paper on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her phones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve installed tracers in the landlines. I think she\u2019s keeping her mobile in her vehicle.\u201d He turned so he could watch the dark interior of the apartment through the window. \u201cUnless there is something else you want, I\u2019m finished here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just received a report from the New York branch,\u201d Genaro said. \u201cOur team has disappeared.\u201d</p><p>He went still. \u201cAll of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. New York will monitor the morgues, but I think it unlikely that King would leave any corpses to be found.\u201d Genaro sounded tired. \u201cI would like to know how he identified the members of the team and their location.\u201d</p><p>So would Delaporte; he had personally trained the team, and several of the men on it had been his most dependable hunters. This changed everything. \u201cDo you want me to finish here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Until the female is found, Hoff still has some value.\u201d Genaro paused as if thinking. \u201cWe\u2019ll take her tomorrow in the lab. Kirchner will need your assistance. Report to my office first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Delaporte ended the call.</p><p>Engaging in an affair with an enemy of the company had been distasteful to him, as had the role he had taken on\u2014to appear to Nella Hoff as a potential blackmail target. He understood the psychology behind posing as a would-be pedophile in order to intrigue her, but he hadn\u2019t cared for having his background records salted with indications of a predilection he personally despised.</p><p>But the disgust he had expected to feel when he was with her had never manifested when they were together. It was true that he preferred women who had an open, mature attitude about sex, but something about Nella Hoff had made the role-playing less of a chore. He\u2019d enjoyed her submissiveness, even if it had been self-serving.</p><p>The sex itself had been unnervingly erotic.</p><p>That part of his assignment had come to an end now. Tomorrow when Nella went into work, she would be drugged, removed discreetly from the lab, and installed in one of the \u201ctreatment\u201d rooms, where he and Kirchner would begin a lengthy and painful interrogation. From what Genaro had said, Delaporte imagined he would be called upon to sexually abuse her. It was always more emotionally effective when the captive was subjected to repeated violations by a former lover.</p><p>He walked back to the bedroom to look at her one last time, so that he could remember her as she had been.</p><p>Delaporte registered that the bed was empty a moment before the lights snapped on and a gun barrel pressed against the base of his skull.</p><p>\u201cYou really should look inside the tampon boxes and under the trash can liners, Daddy,\u201d Nella said in a mocking, girlish voice. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how much you can hide in those little places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d He felt almost proud of her. \u201cWhat are we going to do now, Nella?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to move, because I know the information in your records about your skills as a soldier and a mercenary wasn\u2019t complete bullshit,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd as much as I\u2019d like to pull this trigger, I need some information from you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThen go ahead and pull the trigger.\u201d</p><p>She slid the gun around as she came to stand before him, until it rested under his chin. \u201cLet\u2019s clear the air first. You\u2019re not a pedophile in the making, and I\u2019m not a Daddy\u2019s girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt does to me. You knew I\u2019d look for the weakest link, and you set yourself up to resemble one.\u201d She watched his eyes, her own bright with nerves. \u201cWhere did I fuck up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a little too heavy- handed with Kirchner,\u201d he told her, at the same time subtly changing his stance. \u201cAlso, offering him sex was a mistake. He\u2019s a celibate as well as a misogynist.\u201d</p><p>She grew thoughtful. \u201cI didn\u2019t think the wife was window-dressing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s an experienced bodyguard,\u201d he said. \u201cSo are the two women posing as his teenage daughters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you\u2019re giving me a great deal of free, valuable information, Don.\u201d She pressed the barrel in a little harder. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s because you like talking to your plants.\u201d</p><p>Her pun amused him. \u201cI admire your resourcefulness.\u201d \u201cOh, you admire my tits and my arse,\u201d she corrected, her voice changing from American to a working-class British accent. \u201cHe\u2019s called you off, then?\u201d</p><p>He saw no point in lying to her. \u201cHe has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen am I to be taken?\u201d</p> <p>He gave her a wistful smile. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>He took her down with a minimum amount of trouble, knocking the gun away before he pinned her to the floor under his bulk. The weapon didn\u2019t discharge, and Nella didn\u2019t make a sound. She tried every trick he knew to dislodge him, and a couple of moves that were new. Then she stopped and lay under him for a moment, panting hard.</p><p>\u201cDo me now,\u201d she said, lifting her chin like an animal baring its throat. \u201cGo on. It\u2019s this or I have to open a vein. You can tell that pisser Genaro I got the jump on you, and you just reacted too fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one gets the jump on me.\u201d Delaporte wrapped one big hand around her neck. \u201cAnd I tell him only the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBallocks.\u201d She wriggled. \u201cDo you need a bit of theater again to get the job done? Should I do the death scene from Othello? \u2018Kill me tomorrow, let me live tonight.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Delaporte applied enough pressure to temporarily impede the flow of blood to Nella\u2019s brain, causing her to lose consciousness. He released his grip in time to keep from killing her, and then moved aside, sitting on the floor beside her.</p> <p>Judging by the mistakes she\u2019d made, Nella had not been in the field for very long. Nor had she been trained properly. Delaporte disliked seeing the waste of a good agent, even one that worked for the other side.</p><p>No, if he was honest, he hated the thought of seeing this woman tortured and killed before her body was burned to ash in the lab\u2019s massive incinerator. She\u2019d been exceptionally brave and, in her own fashion, honorable.</p><p>He stripped off her nightgown and tore it into strips, which he used to bind her ankles together. As he rolled her over onto her belly to tie her hands behind her, the light illuminated her back and he saw what appeared to be a loose flap of skin on her shoulder blade. On closer inspection it turned out to be a small circle of thin, flesh-colored latex that had been glued directly onto her skin with spirit gum.</p><p>Delaporte found the edge of the latex patch and peeled it back slowly. Beneath it was a black oval with the outlined profile of a very familiar face.</p><p>He took out his mobile and dialed a number he rarely called. \u201cMy lord,\u201d he said when his master\u2019s low, powerful voice answered. \u201cWe have another problem here in Atlanta.\u201d</p><p>Madame Butterfly stood over Rowan, her sword glittering like the madness in her eyes. \u201cHellspawn. I saw what you did. I saw.\u201d She brought down the sword.</p><p>Rowan rolled out of the way, and landed with a thump on a hard floor. Sunlight blinded her as she groaned and clutched her aching head.</p><p>Another one of the nightmares, and now it had opera in it.</p> <p>She grabbed the edge of the futon, using it to pull herself up to grab her watch and check the time. It was either eight a.m. or eight p.m. She really needed to invest in an alarm clock.</p><p>It took a while for her to wake up, not that she didn\u2019t seriously consider crawling back under the covers and hiding there for the rest of her life. She drank two cups of coffee, one in the bathroom, where she saw what looked like the remains of a black eye instead of the beginnings of one. Hopefully her ability to heal quickly would get rid of most of it by the time she had to go to work.</p><p>As Dansant\u2019s new sous-chef, an evil, gleeful little voice inside her head reminded her as she dressed. And wouldn\u2019t that promotion make her everyone\u2019s best friend.</p><p>On her way back and forth to wash up, she eyed Meriden\u2019s door. She remembered Sean coming in her apartment, the soggy cuddling session, and not much else. There were no signs he\u2019d done anything while she\u2019d slept in his lap except put her to bed, not that she thought he would have. She would have never pegged him as a guy who would offer his shoulder to cry on. The breaking and entering, now, that was more his style.</p><p>She had unfinished business with Sean Meriden, but it would have to wait until she figured out a way to deal with Dansant.</p><p>Rowan made a bowl of cereal and idly picked up one of her new books to read while she ate. This one was a memoir, written in the late nineteenth century by an ex-priest who had been sent to exorcise some people who thought they were vampires, and in the process had lost his faith and given up the cassock.</p><p>According to the introduction the ex-priest had penned the memoir while he was in his eighties, which meant he\u2019d gone vampire-busting in the late eighteenth century. The preface, written by some snotty editor, also warned that the contents were largely considered by the literary community of the time to be creative nonfiction.</p><p>There was a lot of Latin terminology to plow through, Rowan discovered, and by her third bowl of cereal she was pretty sure she agreed with the editor. The ex-priest alternated between ranting about secret societies within the church and cursed souls who\u2019d tried to attack him and drink his blood while he\u2019d doused them with holy water and prayed over them.</p><p>She was just about to give it up when she got to a page listing what the author had discovered about the people he referred to as \u201ctruly damned by God\u201d:</p><p>They who are damned for eternity will be comely of appearance, the men strong and handsome, the women delicate and lovely. They exude the precious scent of God\u2019s gift of torment, that of flowers, but it is a lie to lure and trap their unsuspecting victims. They will partake of neither food nor drink but wine. When brought into the light of heaven they will shield their eyes and grow agitated; if left in shelter they will sleep without breath or movement. They have knowledge of the black arts and wield these against their victims, each with their own spell to create confusion of the senses and to enslave with but a few words. Few can resist their murmurings and touches. They fornicate freely and respect not the bonds of marriage or betrothal. Nothing may cut their flesh but copper, which burns them like fire. They heal from any wound, but thanks be to God may be dispatched back to Hell by beheading.</p><p>She read the passage three times before she understood why it riveted her: confusion of the senses . . . enslave with but a few words.</p><p>Last night Dansant had used a few words to stop them from being mugged. Those boys had had the perfect opportunity to roll them, and yet they had done exactly what he had told them to without a murmur. They\u2019d acted like he\u2019d turned them into zombies.</p><p>She began comparing what she knew about her boss with the ex-priest\u2019s crazy list. Strong and handsome, check. Smells like flowers, check. Never eats, never drinks anything but wine . . .</p><p>She skimmed through the rest of the book, looking for more lists, and stopped only when she saw the image of an old engraving of a Templar warrior sitting on a horse in the middle of a battlefield. It was a gory portrait, the ground around him littered with dead bodies.</p><p>The warrior-priest\u2019s face looked exactly like that of Jean-Marc Dansant.</p><p>\u201cNo. He can\u2019t be.\u201d Rowan slammed the book shut as she thought frantically. She\u2019d worked beside Dansant for weeks, had watched him cook, and she couldn\u2019t remember a single time she had seen him taste the food. He never ate with her and the line cooks for the family meal; he would simply sit at the head of the table and drink a glass of wine. Last night when she\u2019d given him a bowl of her stir-fry, he\u2019d smelled it, but he hadn\u2019t tasted it.</p><p>And in all the time she\u2019d been here, she had never once seen him during the day.</p><p>\u201cOh, for Christ\u2019s sake, he\u2019s not a vampire.\u201d Saying it out loud didn\u2019t make her feel better. \u201cHe works nights. He said it was hypnosis. Maybe he wasn\u2019t hungry.\u201d</p><p>She opened the book and stared at the engraving again, absently touching her neck. The artist had done a lot of fine detail work; he\u2019d added tiny lines for the eyelashes and the warrior\u2019s mustache, and a dot on his jawline in the exact same spot where Dansant had a tiny mole. . . .</p><p>Oh, shit. Rowan got up and ran out to the bathroom.</p><p>She checked her throat, her arms, and then stripped down to her skin and did a full body check. She found no bite marks or any signs to indicate she\u2019d been used as a blood bank.</p><p>Of course there aren\u2019t any marks, that slimy, malicious voice in her head purred as she got dressed. You heal too fast.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to do. It wasn\u2019t as if she could walk up to the executive chef and ask him if he was an immortal killer who fed on human blood. But she knew the dark kyn were a reality, and from the research she and Matthias had done, she knew they still existed in clusters all over the world, living apparently normal lives in order to hide in plain sight.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a stretch to believe one of them had decided to open a French restaurant. When you want to catch a mouse, you don\u2019t set out an empty trap. You bait it with something they can\u2019t resist.</p><p>Speculating like this was ridiculous. What she needed was a computer, so she could run some basic checks on her boss. Looking into his background would doubtless provide logical explanations for all of his weirdness, and that would settle things.</p><p>Rowan went to the nearest branch of the New York Public Library, which was busy but fortunately provided public-access computers. She sat at an open terminal, put down the notepad she\u2019d brought with her, and logged into her Internet account. A window with a blinking red border popped up to inform her that she had exceeded her e-mail account storage limits. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I haven\u2019t written an e-mail in weeks, she thought, annoyed as she entered her password for her inbox. Must be SPAM.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t SPAM. There were over four hundred new messages waiting to be read, and the senders column read like a Takyn roll call: Romulus, Jezebel, Vulcan, Paracelsus, Delilah, Zephyrus, Magdalene, Orion, Sapphira . . .</p><p>Before Rowan could open the first e- mail, an IM screen popped onto the monitor. The sender was Paracelsus.</p> <p>P: He jests at scars</p><p>She typed in the last words of the quote to confirm her identity: that never felt a wound.</p><p>P: Where are you? Are you hurt?</p><p>No, she wrote back. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m in New York.</p><p>P: I know. I\u2019ve been turning it upside down looking for you.</p> <p>She chuckled. You\u2019re still here?</p><p>P: Of course. I wasn\u2019t going to leave until I knew you were all right.</p><p>I\u2019m good. It wasn\u2019t exactly a lie. Sorry I haven\u2019t been in touch.</p><p>P: You vanished off the face of the earth for weeks. We\u2019ve been frantic, all of us.</p><p>That explained the e-mail overload. But no one should have been worried; she always checked in. . . . Rowan frowned. She hadn\u2019t checked in, now that she thought about it. She\u2019d completely forgotten about her friends.</p><p>I got tied up with personal business, she typed. But I\u2019m okay. Everyone else all right?</p> <p>P: No. G. sent a team to New York to take a special girl. We thought they were after you. Then they disappeared. Another player in the game.</p><p>Rowan sat back in her chair, trying to take it all in.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have tracked me, she wrote back. I dumped the bike. He doesn\u2019t have anything on me.</p><p>P: V. finally gained access to G.\u2019s clubhouse. What little there is about the op says the target is a female with plenty of talent who escaped custody.</p><p>That could be any of us girls. Yet even as she typed the reply, she remembered facing Genaro\u2019s goons in Price Park. Technically speaking, she and Vulcan had escaped custody, although she couldn\u2019t have left behind any DNA for them to mess with, not unless . . .</p><p>She had touched one of Genaro\u2019s hunters. She had needed the physical contact to shift into the woman he loved most, some blond bombshell named Rosie, and tap him for information. She must have shed some skin cells when she\u2019d dreamveiled herself.</p><p>If G. and this other player are after me, she wrote to Paracelsus, I should get out of Dodge now.</p><p>P: No, my dear, it\u2019s too dangerous. We have not yet identified this new player, and losing the team will have G. watching all points of exit. Stay where you are and keep your head down until V. and I can arrange safe passage.</p> <p>Safe passage meant creating a new identity for her and relocating her across the country. So much for Rowan Dietrich, she thought. On the IM screen, she typed When should I contact you again?</p><p>P: Check in with me in a few days. I sent you my Lucky Lotto numbers. You should buy a ticket today.</p><p>That translated into instructions for her to buy a throwaway mobile phone and call him on a number he\u2019d e- mailed her. Okay, I\u2019ll take care of that as soon as I leave here. My access is public, so would you pass the word around to everyone?</p><p>P: Consider it done. Be careful, my dear.</p><p>Rowan closed the IM screen, checked Paracelsus\u2019s e-mail and jotted down the phone number disguised as Lotto numbers, and then wiped all traces of her session from the terminal.</p><p>At a nearby convenience store, Rowan picked up a throwaway phone and a card for several hundred minutes\u2019 worth of air time. As she stood in line to pay for it, she thought of all the e-mails stacked in her inbox. She had never received so many, and the idea that evidently all of the Takyn were worried about her made her feel absurdly pleased.</p><p>Sometimes, especially after Matthias had brought Jessa back from Atlanta, she\u2019d felt as if she\u2019d become more of a liability than an asset to her boss. She should have remembered that she had other friends, good friends who cared about her and wanted her to be happy.</p><p>She should have remembered . . . \u201cThat son of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>The Puerto Rican man standing in front of her glanced back. \u201cYou talking to me, lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean my bastard of a boss.\u201d She dragged a hand over her head. \u201cHe\u2019s been messing with my head.\u201d</p><p>The man grimaced in sympathy. \u201cMine uses a stopwatch when I take lunch. I come back five minutes late, he docks my pay.\u201d</p><p>Rowan clenched her jaw. \u201cYeah, well, mine isn\u2019t going to dock me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Dansant had Lonzo send Rowan on an errand to get her out of the kitchen, and then called each of the cooks into his office, where he had what the others thought was a private meeting to discuss their performance on the line. Using his influence over them, he instructed them to accept Rowan as the new sous-chef, and almost all of them did.</p><p>Only Lonzo, who had the strongest will of all the men, resisted briefly.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a kid,\u201d he told Dansant in an uncertain tone. \u201cShe ain\u2019t got the chops for it.\u201d</p><p>Dansant tried another approach. \u201cDo you like Rowan, Lonzo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Trick\u2019s okay,\u201d he admitted reluctantly. \u201cFor a woman.\u201d</p><p>Dansant suspected that his garde-manger\u2019s chauvinistic attitude toward the fair sex would never change. \u201cShe has learned a great deal from you.\u201d</p><p>Now the burly man\u2019s chest puffed out. \u201cI\u2019ve taught her a couple things, sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you will agree that it is a credit to you that she has moved up to become the new sous- chef,\u201d Dansant told him. \u201cThat is why you will accept this, because it was your teaching that helped her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit?\u201d His expression became filled with confusion, and began to clear. \u201cI\u2019m that good a teacher, huh?\u201d</p><p>Dansant had suspected appealing to his chef\u2019s vanity would be a way around his stubborn will. \u201cYes, you are. And you will watch over Rowan and assure that others are respectful of her. An insult to her is the same as an insult to you. Do you understand my instructions now?\u201d</p><p>The last of the doubt faded from Lonzo\u2019s harsh features. \u201cYes, Chef.\u201d</p><p>It was rather comical, watching the reception the line cooks gave Rowan when she returned from the market with the Italian parsley Lonzo had sent her to buy. Vince cuffed her shoulder as he passed by her, and George asked her if she needed help setting up Bernard\u2019s old station to her liking. Manny gave her advice on how to stock her speed racks, and even Enrique watched her anxiously, so that when she needed a certain pan or dish he had it at her station before she could call for it.</p><p>Much to Dansant\u2019s disappointment, Rowan showed no reaction, although she flinched several times whenever he came near her. Unlike the enthusiasm she had shown on previous shifts, now she took no interest in his preparations, and left her station only to make a quick trip to the restroom halfway through the night.</p><p>Her cooking was as inventive and marvelous as Dansant had hoped. She remade his cuisses de canard au chou, using a dusky merlot instead of the traditional cognac, and cranberry jelly instead of tomato paste. The result did not greatly change the appearance of the dish, but subtly altered the aroma and emphasized the flavors. When Dansant made the first of his customary rounds of the dining area, his patrons raved over the dish.</p><p>\u201cThis reminds me of the duck we used to have at Thanksgiving every year,\u201d one delighted matron told him. \u201cMy grandmother used cabbage in her stuffing, and would glaze the bird with cranberries and burgundy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Americans celebrated Thanksgiving with turkey,\u201d Dansant said.</p><p>The woman chuckled. \u201cNot when their father goes duck hunting every November.\u201d</p><p>The kitchen remained busy for the rest of the night, and Dansant decided to keep his distance from Rowan to let her enjoy her victory. It wasn\u2019t until after closing, when the line cooks congratulated her on their way out, that Rowan looked directly at him, her eyes filled with suspicion and dislike. He returned her gaze until the last cook had left, and watched her stalk toward the stairs.</p><p>\u201cRowan.\u201d He watched her come to a halt. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>She spun around, her features tight, her eyes glittering. \u201cIs there something else you wanted, Chef?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have obviously had enough congratulations,\u201d he said, walking toward her. \u201cI thought you would be pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be, if they were sincere.\u201d She closed the distance between them. \u201cWhat did you do to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo? Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same way you did nothing to those kids the night we went to the opera,\u201d she countered.</p><p>She thought he had hypnotized the line cooks. Well, it wasn\u2019t far from the truth. \u201cI may have threatened to fire them all if they treated you badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re cooks. That would have made them behave worse.\u201d She planted her hands on her hips. \u201cHave you ever done that to me? Hypnotized me, made me forget things?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop to wonder how she had come to such a conclusion. He also felt a fresh wave of shame for the times he had used his influence over her. \u201cI have only tried to be your friend, Rowan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFriends don\u2019t fuck with other friends\u2019 minds, Dansant.\u201d</p><p>He could compel her now to forget all about this unfortunate discovery, and tomorrow night she would be back at his side and happy to be there. And he would be even more of a monster than he already was. \u201cIf I have said or done anything to upset you, I apologize.\u201d</p><p>She sat down on the bench by the table where the line cooks ate together. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to believe from you anymore. You\u2019re making me think crazy things.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to tell her everything, but it was not yet time. He had to first regain her trust. \u201cHow can I convince you that I am sincere?\u201d</p><p>She seized an apple from the bowl of fruit on the table and tossed it to him. \u201cTake a bite of that.\u201d</p><p>He regarded the apple and then her. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you\u2019re who I think you are, you won\u2019t. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He polished the apple on his sleeve and took a bite, and then another. Only when he had reduced it to a core did she sigh and prop her head in her hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you want me to eat something else?\u201d he asked. \u201cA pear, perhaps?

Then it is tasted and tested and becomes more than it is, something wonderful and beautiful to see and touch and taste and smell. Something that can give comfort and pleasure as well as sustain life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich makes us the same as cannibals. Yum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not the same, and you know,\u201d he chided. \u201cWhat we create, what we are, is consumed by hunger, but surrendering to it allows us to become a part of another living thing. That is when we truly come alive. As for food, if our passion has transformed it, has made it what it was meant to be, it can never be gone or forgotten. It becomes part of another life. It will live on in them forever. As we do.\u201d</p><p>She uttered a shaky laugh. \u201cYou make it sound like sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d he corrected. \u201cThat is why it is so important to us, oui? Why it pleases us so much. When it is done correctly, cooking does not feed our pride or lust. It does not make us better or more noble. It is not meant for us at all. It is our gift to the world. A gift made from the purest, deepest love. The love we feel for others. The love we know in our dreams.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her eyes with her fingers. \u201cYeah, well, some of us don\u2019t get that dream. Some of us are dumped here. Dirty and worthless. Unwanted and unloved. Just like garbage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are wrong.\u201d</p><p>Dansant drew Rowan to her feet. \u201cClose your eyes.\u201d When she tried to step away, he put his arm around her. \u201cLet me show you what I mean. I did eat the apple for you.\u201d</p><p>So he had. Reluctantly she closed her eyes. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to feed me something to inspire me, it had better not be that tuna that came in yesterday. Lonzo said it smelled off.\u201d She felt something cool and wet against her bottom lip, and smelled warm, ripe peaches. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that movie Nine and a Half Weeks, too, so no jalape\u00f1os.\u201d But when she licked her lower lip, she tasted the smooth, decadent taste of heavy cream.</p><p>What the hell is he doing?</p><p>\u201cIf you open your eyes,\u201d he warned, \u201cit will not work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d She waited.</p><p>The smell of peach darkened, became more complex. At the same time something brushed her top lip, dusting it with a sandy substance that her tongue discovered was crystals of brown sugar.</p><p>\u201cDo not swallow yet,\u201d he whispered against her ear. \u201cOnly open your heart, and taste.\u201d</p> <p>She knew the tiny dot of liquid he put at the corner of her mouth was vanilla extract from the intense smell, but another dot on the other side turned out to be almond. The two blended on her tongue with the sugar and the cream, making her hungrier for the peach slice he had to be waving around under her nose.</p><p>But when she opened her mouth to take a bite, he placed a fragment of something thin and crumbling on her tongue that tasted of butter and flour. Then something popped, and the juice of a blackberry dripped over the fragment.</p><p>His hands cradled her face. \u201cNow us.\u201d</p><p>He put his mouth to hers, opening her to his tongue, which tasted of a peach that had been poached in a dark wine. Her head whirled as he kissed her, and all the flavors came together as their mouths melded.</p><p>Rowan wanted to jerk away, but the coolness of his tongue slid against the heat of her own, and kissing him back was suddenly everything, the world without end, all that she was pouring out from her mouth to his, a flood of hunger and satisfaction entwining and melting and becoming something more. She clutched at the softness of his white jacket, afraid she would drop into some dark and mindless place with him, and then terrified that she wouldn\u2019t, that he would end this and leave her alone and cold.</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d He lifted his mouth and kissed her temple, holding her, rocking her a little. \u201cDo you see now, ma m\u00fbre? It begins with a single thing. A peach. A blackberry. A kiss. And then we make it more. We make it love.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe she was crying, but she was, all over his immaculate whites. The tears flooded her eyes and streamed down her cheeks, dashing the beautiful taste in her mouth with salt.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do this to me. Not now. Not when I don\u2019t know . . .\u201d She would not mention her feelings for Sean. And there was no way in hell she would ever tell him that she\u2019d suspected him of being a vampire\u2014or that she felt just as strongly for him as she did Meriden. She ground her forehead into his shoulder. \u201cI can\u2019t do this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His hand stroked over her curls. \u201cBut the time will come when you can. I hope it is with me, Rowan. I would very much like to be there.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cI must go now. I will see you tomorrow, oui?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She managed a wan smile. \u201cHave a good night.\u201d</p><p>After Dansant left in his cab, Rowan went upstairs to shower and get ready for bed. Although watching her boss eat normal human food had gone a long way toward reassuring her, she had a whole new set of problems. He was definitely interested in her; he would never have kissed her like that if he were gay.</p><p>She would not think about the kiss. If she did, she\u2019d be up all night remembering it and savoring it and dissecting it, moment by moment. After all, it had been the best kiss of her life.</p><p>Hearing Meriden coming up the stairs helped clear her head. She pulled on her clothes before she stepped out to catch him on the landing.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey yourself.\u201d He turned to unlock his door.</p><p>\u201cGot a minute?\u201d</p><p>He turned on her. \u201cAre you going to cry all over me again?\u201d</p><p>She winced. She had been going heavy on the water-works lately, something Dansant seemed to have no problem with but she suspected Sean hated. \u201cNo. I just wanted to explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo explanation required, Cupcake.\u201d He went into his apartment and slammed the door in her face.</p><p>If that didn\u2019t decide things for her, nothing would. Meriden wasn\u2019t interested, and Dansant was. She could have the prince instead of the frog. And why was her hand reaching for his doorknob? She didn\u2019t give a damn what Sean thought of her, or why he\u2019d shut her out\u2014again\u2014or whatever new bug had crawled up his ass. She\u2019d just go in and make that clear to him, once and for all, so there were no future misunderstandings.</p><p>He was standing over his desk, flipping through a file. He didn\u2019t even bother to glance at her. \u201cI told you, not tonight, honey. I\u2019ve got a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got something.\u201d She leaned back against the door and folded her arms. \u201cI\u2019m going to say this, so you might as well listen.\u201d</p><p>He stopped flipping, and under his shirt his back muscles went rigid. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were decent to me last night, and I\u2019m grateful. But I can\u2019t have you wandering in and out of my place whenever you like.\u201d As he looked at her, she held out her hand. \u201cGive me the key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sitting on top of the frame over your door,\u201d he told her. \u201cGo get it yourself.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her hand. \u201cHow did you know it was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m psychic,\u201d he snarled. \u201cYou done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you?\u201d She showed him some teeth. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>He crossed the floor with a few strides. \u201cThen why are you still here, Cupcake?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at the third button on his shirt. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He took hold of the front of her shirt with his fist, tugging her up. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Somehow she went from standing to dangling, until he plastered her against him, pulled her head back by her hair, and took her mouth with his. His arm pulled her ass in so tight she could feel the hard edges of his belt buckle against her mons, and the way it rubbed against her as he carried her to the desk sent heat slamming through her.</p><p>She made the mistake of straining and wriggling, and then he was sweeping his arm across his desk to clear it and laying her out on her back. Before she could sit up he was on her, spinning her around as he buried his mouth against her throat, his teeth dragging over her skin and sending her right out of her skull.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He lifted off her, dropping into his big chair, and sliding her off onto his lap. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Rowan got a grip on his shoulders as he situated her legs and then ran his broad hand over her left breast. The rough caress knocked the wind out of her, along with his name. \u201cSean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d He wound his fingers through her curls and held her, looking all over her face as he put his other hand to her breast again, his palm hard and rhythmic, a beast\u2019s paw kneading. \u201cSo fucking hot.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she was. He had her right where he wanted her, straddling his crotch, only her panties and his jeans keeping them apart, and from the length and stiffness of his erection she could think of nowhere else she\u2019d rather be.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he breathed, his eyes closing a little as he rocked his hips into hers. \u201cLike that. Right there.\u201d He used a handful of her shirt like a shop rag, dragging it up the damp line of her torso to expose her bra. Then he went at it with his teeth, jerking one edge out of the way so he could get at her, his mouth open and wet and sucking, teeth grazing, making stars burst inside her skull and sending a gush of wetness between her legs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d The word barely made it through the vise of her throat, so she tried again. \u201cSean, wait.\u201d</p><p>He let her go, the release of the erotic suction making a soft pop. \u201cNo. Give me that mouth.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands against his hot face. \u201cI kiss you, you turn me loose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo fucking way.\u201d He shoved her hips down on him. \u201cYou feel that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of hard to miss.\u201d She rested her forehead against his. \u201cI know. Jesus. This is nuts.\u201d She sucked in a breath of terrified delight as the ridge of his cock bumped into the folds over her clit. \u201cA kiss for now.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and he shifted under her. \u201cWhere you gonna kiss me?\u201d</p><p>Rowan\u2019s head spun as she saw herself sliding from his lap, opening his pants, and taking him out. Her mouth watered as she imagined gripping the hard shaft and putting her tongue to the bulb of his cockhead. She could feel his hands in her hair, holding her, guiding her as he pushed between her lips, gliding over her tongue as she sucked . . .</p><p>He knew what she was thinking. \u201cYou like that, don\u2019t you?\u201d He dragged her hand down, pressed it over him.</p> <p>\u201cOh, honey.\u201d She rubbed him, blind with her own lust. \u201cI\u2019d love it.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her close, whispered in her ear. \u201cYou gonna let me kiss you, too?\u201d He licked the rim of her ear. \u201cBecause I want it. I want to kiss you and lick you. I\u2019ll eat you all night, Cupcake.\u201d</p><p>She was going to come, right like this, spread-eagled on his lap and shaking with need. And he knew it, because he started moving her back and forth, dragging her across him as his tongue did evil things to her ear, his breath harsh against it as he kept talking.</p><p>\u201cI can feel it, all warm and wet for me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He pushed against her, stroking her harder. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m gonna spread those long legs and hold you down and kiss that sweet little pussy. Can you feel my tongue inside you? Fucking you nice and slow, in and out, until you beg for my cock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she groaned, but he only laughed and bit her earlobe, then pushed the tip of his tongue in her ear.</p><p>Rowan exploded, coming and coming again in waves that wouldn\u2019t stop, until she thought she would lose her mind, her body twisting and fighting his hard grip and then shuddering over and over, convulsing from the force of it, and on some level she felt his arms tighten and heard the wrenching sound of his groan as he jerked under her, his hips slamming up once, twice, three times.</p> <p>\u201cGod damn it.\u201d He gathered her in and held her, his hands rough but reassuring as he stroked her arms and back. His chest heaved under her as if he couldn\u2019t get enough air into his lungs. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a clue,\u201d she panted, still fighting for oxygen herself. \u201cI think I\u2019m bleeding from the ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not. I already checked.\u201d He tucked her head against his neck and sat back, holding her that way as they both cooled down. After a long time, he said, \u201cI haven\u2019t come in my pants since I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, I usually take mine off.\u201d She was too drained to lift her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need a term?\u201d</p><p>She offered up a weak chuckle. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good.\u201d Slowly she began the process of untangling her limbs from his, until he stopped her. She lifted her head, surprised to see the regret on his face. \u201cSean, that was the best orgasm I\u2019ve had in years. Maybe ever. So if you give me shit about it, I\u2019m punching you in the face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He lifted her off him and set her on her feet before he surveyed the dark stain covering the crotch of his work pants. \u201cWhat do I get if I say I didn\u2019t mean to be so rough with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKicked somewhere it hurts bad.\u201d She pulled down her shirt. \u201cI\u2019d better go before I really have to whup your ass.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d almost made it to the door when he caught her and turned her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get my kiss.\u201d He bent down, touched his mouth to hers, rubbing her lips with his in a sweet, soothing motion. \u201cThat was beautiful, watching you come for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was primitive, animalistic, and fucking scary as hell.\u201d She kissed him back with the same soft tenderness. \u201cAnd beautiful, feeling you come under me.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand over her curls. \u201cYou tired?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never felt more awake or alive. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want that kiss.\u201d He stepped back and held out his hand. \u201cStay with me, Rowan.\u201d</p><p>PART FOUR</p><p>Maison</p><p>September 29, 2004</p><p>Nice, France</p><p>The chef tested the fragment emulsion three times, lapping it from the wooden spoon with all the enthusiasm of a Pekingese being fed medication. He set down the implement, closed his eyes, and exhaled slowly before looking up. \u201cIt is acceptable for the salmon tonight, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Chef.\u201d After spending two years learning the hierarchy of the kitchen, over which Renaud Giusti ruled with an ungloved iron fist, Nathan Frame knew better than to smile. \u201cWould you consider having Gisele prepare tarte \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me vaudoise to finish?\u201d</p><p>Few junior chefs had the nerve to suggest anything to Giusti, but the invocation of his daughter\u2019s name pulled a small, sour smile from the old master\u2019s face. \u201cAh, now I know. Giradet cooked for you when you were in F\u00e9chy. No one prepares saumon sauvage juste ti\u00e9de like the Pope of Crissier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Nathan echoed dutifully. His was better, and they both knew it, but to say so would be the same as spitting on the retired chef, widely considered to be the grand master of traditional French cuisine.</p><p>Giusti frowned. \u201cI am not sure. There is only so much wild salmon in the case.\u201d He glared at Nathan. \u201cYou cannot make it with anything else, Anglais. It would be a crime against Nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa. Nathan.\u201d Gisele stepped between her American husband and her French father and planted her hands on her hips. \u201cWill you argue about fish and sauce until the bistro opens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are men,\u201d her mother said from the chopping table, where she was packing split leeks with bouquet garni. \u201cOf course they will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have me serve, Marie? Cassoulet and black peasant bread? Hmph.\u201d Giusti\u2019s black eyes softened as he rumpled her light brown hair with a big, callused hand. \u201cYour husband must learn these things, ma douce, if he is to be a true French chef someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeday?\u201d Her dimples appeared. \u201cSurely it will not take so long to teach him everything you know, Papa.\u201d</p><p>Giusti grunted. \u201cOnce I thought it would be eternity. Now . . .\u201d He shrugged before regarding his son- in-law. \u201cNathan, you will go to the market to buy more fennel tops for the salmon emulsion.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cAlso I am thinking Gisele will need more unsalted butter for les tartes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you say, Chef.\u201d</p><p>An hour later Nathan made his way through the crowded outdoor markets along the Cours Saleya. He didn\u2019t bother to hurry; the locals and tourists crowding around the striped tents, caf\u00e9s, and boutiques wouldn\u2019t allow it. Coming to the market was an almost daily chore, one Giusti probably enjoyed sticking him with, but Nathan didn\u2019t mind. If not for the handwritten signs and the voices chattering in French, he might have stepped through time to one of the turn-of-the-century open-air markets in old New York City.</p><p>Nathan had been careful since leaving Italy. He\u2019d moved around for almost two years, assuming and discarding identities as he slowly erased all clues to his past. He\u2019d known when he\u2019d left the Order that his mentors would come after him; he\u2019d been brought to Rome to finish his education and engage in their holy war against the maledicti, and he could not be allowed to roam freely with the knowledge he had. They had never anticipated his defection, of course; the Order had raised him from birth to serve them.</p><p>The day was warm; too warm for the long-sleeved shirt Nathan wore. He never went out bare armed in public, however. Someday soon he would have to have removed the twin dragon tattoos on his forearms. Whatever ability the double taijitu marked, it had never manifested. Now they were little more than slave brands his former masters could use to identify him.</p><p>Even now Nathan wasn\u2019t sure why he\u2019d turned his back on the men who had created and raised him to fight for their cause. Trained from birth to think of the Order as his only family, Nathan had felt the fire of conviction. Surrendering himself to his masters\u2019 will had not caused him a moment of doubt. He had been convinced he was one of the Brethren up until his final test, when he had been pitted against one of the captive demons so that he would know the reality of their cause.</p><p>The Darkyn male had been deliberately weakened, both by starvation and torture, and had offered little resistance. Toward the end he had seemed almost happy to be delivered to his death. But when the time came to make the killing blow, all of the fire and hatred had drained out of Nathan. He found himself standing over the pathetic remains of his opponent, his blade hanging at his side, his eyes locked on the ruin of the once-beautiful face.</p><p>The evil one had smiled up at him. \u201cI forgive you, boy. I forgive you.\u201d</p><p>Nathan had backed out of the cell, suddenly awake as if after a lifetime of sleepwalking, completely horrified. He had been whipped for his cowardice, and sent back to training, where he had been beaten and tormented for his failure. Something changed inside him as he endured the pain and deprivation. He had done everything they asked of him, waiting, watching, and when the chance came, he had slipped silently out of the catacombs and through the city, not knowing where he would go, only that he would die before he returned.</p><p>He did not deserve his life, or Gisele, but now they were his. He would never spend another night praying on his knees to a God who permitted things like the Order and the maledicti to exist among the innocent. If that damned him to hell, he would gladly burn for it for all eternity.</p><p>\u201cNathan.\u201d A heavy hand pounded his shoulder from behind, making Nathan jump, and he turned to see a short, bald man holding a brace of rascasse in his hand. \u201cYou are early today, good. Jacques just came with a fresh shipment from Lympia. You see?\u201d He shook the scorpion fish in emphasis. \u201cBeautiful, no?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBeautiful, yes, Henri.\u201d Already he could taste the bouillabaisse he would make with them. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>The fishmonger beamed. \u201cFor you, I make the best of deals. Come, see the monkfish I just put out. They are\u2014\u201d He made a kissing sound.</p><p>Before Nathan could reply, someone called out, \u201cExcuse me. Are you American? Excuse me.\u201d Nathan looked around until he spotted another man dressed like a tourist waving and walking toward him. The stranger wore a straw hat and carried a hot pink plastic tote filled with even tackier souvenirs.</p> <p>\u201cHenri, go back to your stall,\u201d Nathan said softly as he reached into his back pocket.</p><p>The fishmonger scowled. \u201cBut mon ami\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, please.\u201d He took out the butterfly blade he always carried but kept it concealed in his palm. \u201cI\u2019ll be along shortly.\u201d</p><p>Henri grumbled as he trudged off, leaving Nathan to face Straw Hat alone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awfully good of you to wait,\u201d the man gushed as he wove around a couple of Spaniards before stopping a few feet away. The jacket covering his free hand effectively disguised the gun he had pointed at Nathan\u2019s chest, but he made sure Nathan got a good look at it. \u201cI don\u2019t meet too many Americans around these parts. Could I ask you to step over here and have a private conversation with me? I could use some advice.\u201d He shuffled closer. \u201cAnd we wouldn\u2019t want anyone else to become . . . involved . . . in this conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Four years of his life crumbled before Nathan\u2019s eyes, but he didn\u2019t bother to put on an act of ignorance. The one thing about himself he had not altered was his face, and the man pretending to be a tourist had been one of his trainers in the catacombs. He was also one of the best of their human hunters. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour pretty wife\u2019s doctor. After her last checkup, he was quite concerned. He sent a consult to Paris.\u201d The man moved the jacket to the left. \u201cIf you want to know more, you\u2019ll walk quietly to the parking lot. We don\u2019t want to cause a scene, Mr. Nathan Frame.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cSuch pedestrian names you have been using, Dancer. What do they call you? Nathan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Dancer anymore, and I\u2019m not going back with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are, my son.\u201d The man smiled broadly. \u201cYou forget, you are in France, not America. We control the authorities here.\u201d His mouth flattened. \u201cAnd you belong to us, Dancer.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d cut his own throat before he voluntarily went back to the Order or used that name again.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I don\u2019t want any trouble,\u201d Nathan lied. He headed for the parking lot. As the man followed him, he looked ahead for some private spot where he could deal with the hunter.</p> <p>The crowd thinned and then disappeared as Nathan made his way down a short side street between two boutiques. There he saw a mound of empty shipping boxes stacked neatly by the wall, high enough to provide cover. He stopped beside them, gathering himself for the strike.</p><p>\u201cIf you are thinking you will disarm me, drag me over there, and break my neck,\u201d Straw Hat said just behind him, \u201cthere is something you should first know.\u201d</p><p>Nathan turned, kicking away the hunter\u2019s weapon before he hauled him behind the boxes and slammed him into the building\u2019s brick wall. He flipped the blade open and held it under the man\u2019s sagging chin. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGisele will be joining us, too.\u201d The hunter smiled. \u201cMy men have just arrived at your father-in-law\u2019s restaurant.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cBy now they should have her in custody.\u201d</p><p>Nathan\u2019s blood turned to frost. \u201cShe has nothing to do with this or me. She is an innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t Gisele tell you the reason she saw the doctor? No? Ah, perhaps she meant it to be a surprise, for your wedding anniversary next week.\u201d The hunter chuckled. \u201cYour wife is pregnant, Dancer. Good job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d He had taken every precaution with Gisele to be sure he didn\u2019t impregnate her.</p><p>\u201cWe retested her blood in our Paris facility, just to be sure.\u201d The hunter grinned. \u201cShe\u2019s already developing a lovely and quite unique set of antibodies to share with your son. If she retains them, we may even breed her again. Not with you, of course. You will have to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Nathan slammed his head into the brick until the man lost consciousness. Then he ran. He ran as he had never run, with all his strength, through the markets and the crowds, knocking over bags of grain and people and bins of fruit, leaving a wide wake of shouting, furious merchants and frightened shoppers. He ran beyond thought, beyond breath, and as he reached Giusti\u2019s he hurled himself at the locked front door, breaking it down.</p><p>\u201cGisele.\u201d</p><p>He found the old man first, sitting on the floor beside the freezer chest, a bloody butcher knife still clutched in his fist. The hunter\u2019s men had shot him in the chest six times.</p><p>Nathan whipped his head around to see a work-worn hand, still holding a tied leek, on the floor.</p><p>\u201cMarie. Oh, God.\u201d</p><p>He hurried over to discover his mother-in-law, shot once through the forehead, staring up at him with wide, lifeless eyes. Nathan felt bile rise in his throat before he stumbled away through the kitchen door and blundered over the body of a man dressed entirely in black. From the look of his wounds, Renaud must have stabbed him with the butcher\u2019s knife several times before he\u2019d died.</p><p>\u201cNathan,\u201d his wife screamed.</p><p>He saw her at the end of the road, being dragged by one man toward a waiting van. He bent to take the gun from the dead man and went after them.</p><p>His wife fought desperately, scratching her attacker\u2019s face and kicking him as she shrieked Nathan\u2019s name. He reached the van just as the man had shoved her inside. A tray of glass vials fell out of the van\u2019s side door, shattering and spilling the blood and tissue in them all over the ground. Nathan felt something burn across the side of his head.</p><p>\u201cGet in the van with her,\u201d the man behind the wheel snarled, cocking the hammer on the pistol as he adjusted his aim. \u201cOr this time I will blow your br\u2014\u201d</p><p>The rest of what he said was lost in a gush of blood. The gun fell from his hand as he tried to pull Nathan\u2019s knife from his neck, and then slumped over the wheel. The van began rolling forward as Nathan lunged at the second man.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard.\u201d Nathan knocked him to the ground, driving his knee into his solar plexus before the other man shoved the heel of his hand into his nose. Bone and cartilage crunched, but Nathan stayed on top of him, battering him with his fists over and over, shattering his jaw, his teeth, his eye sockets. Only when the man went limp did he stagger to his feet and turn to get his wife.</p><p>The van was halfway down the sloping street, gathering speed as it hurtled out of control, striking the back wall of the restaurant before careening in the opposite direction, directly toward a busy intersection.</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d Nathan ran toward the back of the van, where he could see his wife\u2019s pale, blood-streaked face staring out at him. \u201cGisele, jump out,\u201d he shouted. \u201cJump!\u201d</p><p>The driver of the tractor-trailer passed by the traffic light and then hit his brakes just as the van entered the intersection from the opposite direction. The squeal of grinding metal shattered the air as the massive vehicle swerved, but the trailer jackknifed, slamming into the van, which crumpled like a cheap tin toy.</p><p>Screams and shouts erupted around Nathan, and then the truck\u2019s gas tank exploded. Windows all around the square shattered simultaneously as a huge fireball expanded outward, enveloping the truck and the van and several other cars.</p><p>\u201cMonsieur,\u201d someone cried out, and hands clawed at Nathan. \u201cMonsieur, get back!\u201d</p><p>He shook off the tearing fingers and ran into the fire, just in time to take the full brunt of the blast as the van\u2019s tank exploded.</p><p>\u201cHe has not spoken?\u201d a strange voice asked in French.</p><p>\u201cNot a word since they brought him in,\u201d another replied in the same language. \u201cI do not think he will before he dies.\u201d</p><p>Nathan could open his eyes a little, but as before he saw only a swath of black-and-red-stained gauze in front of them. He knew from other awakenings that bandages covered his head and most of his body. He felt no pain, only an absence of feeling and an inability to move, as if his body were dead and only his mind were alive.</p><p>\u201cIt has been two weeks since they brought him in,\u201d the first voice pointed out. \u201cHe may live.\u201d</p><p>Two weeks, here, like this. Nathan tried to understand it. The last thing he remembered was walking through the market to buy herbs and butter. He\u2019d spoken to Henri, the fishmonger. Then . . . nothing. Nothing but opening his eyes now and then and seeing through the slits of his swollen eyelids the stained bandages.</p><p>\u201cHe has third-degree burns over most of his body, and an infection we cannot identify has taken hold. It will only be a few hours, I think.\u201d The second man sighed. \u201cBut he cannot be the one who did this thing, Inspector. He ran into the fire. He did this to himself trying to save them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave them, Doctor?\u201d The cop laughed. \u201cAll of the witnesses who saw the accident agreed that no one could have survived that explosion. So why would he run into it, to save people who were already dead?\u201d</p><p>An explosion? Dead people? A fragment of Nathan\u2019s memory emerged, vague and disjointed, bringing with it terrible sounds and burning light, but no faces. No people.</p><p>\u201cI do not believe he murdered the Giustis,\u201d the doctor said firmly. \u201cNo man who murdered two people could do this to himself trying to save others a few minutes later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was seen running after the van involved in the accident,\u201d the inspector said. \u201cWe know Giusti\u2019s daughter was inside; we were able to identify her remains with her dental records. Perhaps she saw everything and was escaping him. He could have been pursuing her. He may have even caused the accident himself to kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then, in a fit of instantaneous remorse, he hurled himself into the explosion?\u201d The doctor made a disgusted sound. \u201cInspector, you have spent too much time with killers. You suspect everyone, even a man like this poor fool.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAs you say. But when it is over, I want his body autopsied. I want to know exactly who this poor fool is.\u201d</p><p>Nathan heard the men leave the room, but only distantly, as if his mind had been swaddled in the same numb paralysis as his body. The light glowing beyond his bandages dimmed by slow degrees as he tried to make sense of it all. Gisele was dead; her parents murdered. And he was dying.</p><p>His vision blurred and darkened, and Nathan fell away from himself into the void, where there was nothing, no color or sound, no scent or sensation. Later, on some level, he sensed the doctor and the nurses working on him, their frantic efforts to preserve his life. He felt sorry for them, but he didn\u2019t resist the darkness. His time was done, and he was ready to go, to be where she was.</p> <p>Non, mon fr\u00e8re. Two vivid blue lights flared to life in the center of the nothingness, like blazing eyes opened for the very first time. Tonight you do not die. Tonight, we live.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Rowan slept on Meriden\u2019s chest as if she\u2019d never made her bed anywhere else. She didn\u2019t move except to breathe, although after what they\u2019d done over the last five hours she was entitled. He only resisted the satisfied exhaustion that wanted to drag him off into the dark so he could watch her and think.</p><p>He\u2019d never hear or say the word \u201ckiss\u201d without smiling again. And he was going to have that fucking chair bronzed.</p><p>Meriden hadn\u2019t really expected her to stay, not after the tornado of lust they\u2019d generated between them. She\u2019d been on her feet all night, it was late, and he knew it was asking too much. When she\u2019d taken his hand, he\u2019d almost promised to keep it G-rated and simply sleep with her.</p> <p>Until he\u2019d guided her into his bedroom, and she\u2019d turned those big, beautiful eyes on him.</p><p>Her smile had changed from sleepy to feral. \u201cI get to go first.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d gone off on him, peeling away his clothes and running her hands all over him. He knew his size was unsettling to some women, but Rowan felt him up like a greedy kid in the backseat of a car, unable to decide what to touch first. Then she started using her tongue, and dimly recalling that he wasn\u2019t squeaky clean for her, he\u2019d muttered something about jumping in the shower.</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d she purred as she pushed him back on his bed. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>His body clenched as the images kept rolling through his head. He\u2019d held himself back to let her have her fun first, and he\u2019d paid for it. Overtime. By the time she\u2019d stripped him bare he\u2019d had to grab the head rail to keep from ripping off her clothes. Then she\u2019d draped herself over him, licking at his mouth and his neck and his nipples, her body insinuating itself between his thighs, her belly rubbing the straining column of his cock until the head rail began to make ominous cracking sounds.</p><p>She\u2019d lifted her head away from his navel to enjoy his expression. \u201cDon\u2019t let go, or I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d he promised her, not knowing if he meant letting go or her stopping.</p><p>She made a humming sound as she inched lower, nuzzling him. \u201cYou smell good.\u201d</p><p>He smelled like come, and her, and had to agree through his teeth. Then she cupped him, caressing him with her cheek a few times, her fingers stroking the knot his balls were tying themselves into before she slid her tongue along his shaft in a long, slow, wet glide from root to head.</p><p>He\u2019d never been a man to beg. \u201cKiss it.\u201d Shit, he was begging.</p><p>She pursed her lips and touched them to the hot, tight skin stretched over his cockhead. \u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut me in your mouth,\u201d he told her. \u201cSuck on me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted over the wet, seeping eye and slid down to engulf him, and she sucked lightly, teasing him with little flicks of her tongue until his hips arched off the bed. She moved her head with him, just keeping the tip of his penis in her mouth, and he groaned his frustration.</p><p>She released him but kept her lips against him so he felt every word she whispered. \u201cWant a little more, Farm Boy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll of it,\u201d he muttered, looking into her glowing eyes. \u201cGive me everything.\u201d</p><p>She gripped him at the base and then took him in, pushing him deep, sucking harder as she worked her head over his, up and down lower, up and even lower, until he felt the tip of her nose graze his body hair and the hot slick drag of her mouth enveloped him. She held his hips with her hands as she sucked his cock, keeping him from thrusting hard as she kept it slow and deep. He swelled over the soft abrasion of her tongue, and cursed as she scored him gently with the blunt edges of her teeth. It wasn\u2019t a kiss, she was eating him up from the inside out, and when he couldn\u2019t take another second of it without coming he let go of the head rail and reached for her.</p><p>Meriden had fully intended to keep his promises about kissing her, but his dick had other priorities, like getting inside her as fast and deep as it could. He rolled her under him, scooting her up the bed as he wedged himself between her legs and rooted against her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting warm,\u201d she whispered, smiling as she felt his searching cock bumping into her mound. \u201cWarmer.\u201d Slyly she shifted, preventing him from breaching her folds. \u201cColder.\u201d</p><p>Meriden reached down between them, seized his penis and pushed her folds apart with the head.</p><p>\u201cVery warm.\u201d Her eyes narrowed as he found the small niche at her core and squeezed the aching bulb inside it. \u201cHot.\u201d She groaned as he jerked his hips, driving another inch past the muscles and into the tight flutter of her inner tissues. \u201cOh, hell.\u201d</p><p>Meriden cradled her head and pressed her face against his shoulder. The need to plow into her until he flooded her sweet little cunt to overflowing was so strong he wasn\u2019t sure he could make it pleasurable for her. \u201cHold on to me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d She lost the rest as he thrust straight in, as far as he could go, and then dug her fingers into the sides of his arms. \u201cSean.\u201d</p><p>The viselike restriction of her body, the shock in her eyes, and the way she said his name settled everything for him. She hasn\u2019t been with anyone, not in a long time. And if he was an ass for taking pleasure in that discovery, so be it.</p><p>She\u2019d chosen him.</p><p>Somehow the wildness became entangled with tenderness, and Meriden nestled, relishing the relief of being clasped inside her as much as the reassurance of having her body all to himself.</p><p>\u201cRight here, baby.\u201d He kissed the top and bottom of the O that her lips formed, and caught her gasp as he worked a fraction deeper. \u201cDon\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>Meriden recoiled and pressed back in, making the stroke an almost continuous motion that slid into the second breach of her body and then the third. Penetrating her was as darkly satisfying as feeling her nails bite into him. She was drawing blood by the time he brought her to the edge, but it only stoked him more. When she stiffened under him and went over, he fucked her harder, driving into that quivering clench of slick muscle and convulsing nerves without mercy. The sounds that spilled from her were as beautiful as the astonishment in her eyes as he held back and kept stroking.</p><p>Sean made it good for her even as his own pleasure built, past erotic, past anything he\u2019d ever felt. Having sex had never been much more than relieving a need and blowing off his frustrations. Fucking Rowan was like wallowing in pleasure, soaking it up until he felt it pouring out of him in waves of heat and sweat and sensation, raining all over her long, sinewy body, and then he was lost in her, his mind gone, and there was nothing more in the world than his cock and her pussy, and planting himself inside her, giving her all that he was, all he would ever be. . . .</p><p>As the morning light crept in to gild her curls, Meriden remembered something she\u2019d done after the last time, when he\u2019d started drifting off. She\u2019d gotten out of bed, he assumed to do the girl thing and clean up, but then she\u2019d come back almost right away. She\u2019d knelt beside the bed, holding his hand. When he\u2019d opened his eye to see why she was on the floor\u2014he had some ideas, but he wasn\u2019t sure he could give her anything else to play with for a couple of hours\u2014he caught the glint of something shiny.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She sounded odd, and when she climbed in next to him she was shaking. \u201cHold me, will you?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d held her then, but this morning he gently eased her away, smiling a little as she grumbled something and rolled over onto her back. He sat over her, looking at each small, beautifully shaped breast until he had to lean down to brush his mouth over each soft areola. They beaded for him, silently pleading to be sucked, but he drew the covers back and exposed the rest of her, his eyes intent on the dark curly triangle beneath her navel.</p><p>He slid around her, moving down until he hung halfway off the end of the bed, and nudged her legs apart until he had enough room to lie between them. Her sex was dark pink and faintly swollen, the black curls still damp from the last time he\u2019d filled her up. He wasn\u2019t sure how many times he\u2019d done that, only guessing she was probably too sore now to take him again.</p><p>He\u2019d settle for a kiss.</p><p>Wherever Rowan was, something strong and warm wrapped around her, holding her there. She could feel cool air trying to get at her, tickling the damp peaks of her breasts, but the warmth spreading up from her hips flushed throughout her torso, tingling across her nerves and tightening in her chest. Whatever had her was doing something wet and wicked down there, a sweet, moist stroking between those sensitive lips and the almost painful throb of her clit.</p><p>By the time she opened her eyes she was hot, her breasts swelling and her hands fisting, and she saw the head and shoulders of the man who had his open mouth pressed between her legs. He slid his hands up to cup her breasts and squeeze them, and then she saw that he was watching her, too, his eyes burning like her skin as he laved his tongue up and down. He rubbed her clit as if it were a piece of candy to be licked before sliding down and pressing inside the tender ellipse of her body, extending his tongue in long jabs as he fucked her with it.</p><p>He\u2019d started doing this a while ago, she thought, dazed by the force of the surging heat forged by his mouth. He\u2019d been kissing her pussy while she slept. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The erotic knowledge made her moan while his mouth coaxed her out of an unremembered dream and into the rush of sensation. She put her hands over his, helping him massage her breasts as she surrendered to it. As she\u2019d learned last night, with Sean resistance was futile.</p><p>Rowan spiraled out of control, and then she was free-falling through some intense, dark cascade of joy framed in bliss. Another man might have pushed her past the point of pleasure and into pain, but God, Sean seemed to sense exactly how much she could take, even after hours and hours of endless, mindless sex.</p><p>He kissed her down there as she drifted back to reality, a chaste brush of his lips before his tongue swept out to give her pulsing clit one final caress. That last zing made her curl against him after he crawled up her body and rolled onto his side to hold her against him.</p> <p>\u201cTrying to kill me?\u201d she asked his collarbone.</p><p>\u201cNo one dies from a kiss.\u201d He sounded smug, and idly caressed her shoulder and arm. \u201cAnd it was my turn.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cNo second thoughts? No postcoital regrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said, shifting her a little closer. \u201cI don\u2019t do the girl thing.\u201d He tucked in his chin to have a look at her. \u201cYou were something last night. Did you like me?\u201d</p><p>Did she like him? After her little experiment with her hand mirror, she knew she was in love with him. \u201cYou were good.\u201d</p> <p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cJust good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she sighed. \u201cYou suck. I totally had to fake it. All nine hundred and seventy- five times.\u201d She giggled when his arm around her tightened. \u201cOkay, okay, maybe I enjoyed number nine hundred and seventy-four a little.\u201d</p><p>He pretended to think. \u201cWas that the time you were screaming my name, or promising to have it tattooed with \u2018Forever\u2019 on your keister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJohnny Depp did that before he broke up with Winona,\u201d she warned him. \u201cHe had to get the tattoo fixed to say \u2018Wino Forever.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are something else.\u201d He traced the coiling spiral of the dragon on her forearm. \u201cWhat made you pick dragons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething I read in a book once.\u201d She stared up at the ceiling. \u201cThis thing about dragons being princesses in disguise. I liked it.\u201d She eyed his arm. \u201cSo what\u2019s your excuse?\u201d</p> <p>He examined the S-shaped red dragon wrapped in a circle of its own tail. \u201cSeemed like a good idea at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery decent ink job.\u201d She touched the sapphire eyes, which had been rendered so realistically they seemed to glitter. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a taijitu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod bless you,\u201d she teased. \u201cYou get it done somewhere local?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWhen I was over in Italy. I knocked around Europe for a couple years after school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to do that.\u201d She felt sleepy. \u201cSo, you ever think about\u201d\u2014she yawned\u2014\u201cmoonlighting as an alarm clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you needed one.\u201d He pulled the covers up over her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s still early. Go back to sleep, baby.\u201d</p><p>Like a light, she was already out.</p> <p>\u201cThe latest test results are back, Mr. King,\u201d the physician told him. \u201cThere is no change. It would be best for you to consider making your final preparations.\u201d</p><p>Gerald King took the chart from the oncologist and studied the lab slips clipped to his chart. The numbers, dismal as they were, were holding. He still had a few more days. \u201cYou can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. King\u2014\u201d</p><p>He threw the chart at the doctor and roared, \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><p>The oncologist retreated from the suite, leaving King to fume in solitude. He knew he could not allow the situation to continue longer than a day or two; the painkillers were no longer having any effect and soon his nervous system would begin to fail. Once he fell into the final, inevitable coma he would be as good as dead. At best he had forty-eight hours left to find her.</p><p>\u201cMr. King?\u201d his assistant said. \u201cMs. Carroll is calling on the private line for you.\u201d</p><p>King could no longer leave his bed, so he summoned his nurse to wheel the secured phone over to him. After she departed, he answered the call.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to report in hours ago,\u201d he told his operative.</p><p>\u201cMs. Carroll will no longer be reporting to you, Mr. King,\u201d a man with a deep, rather unnerving voice said.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cGenaro? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen carefully.\u201d</p><p>The man spoke at length about GenHance, their transerum, and the hunt for Kyndred. While King was tempted to interrupt several times, the authority in the man\u2019s voice seemed to command his attention. Sometime later he realized that the annoying hum in his ear was a dial tone, and that whoever had called him had hung up.</p><p>King frowned. He couldn\u2019t remember the entire conversation, but two things came back to him: Nella Hoff was dead, killed in a tragic car accident on her way to work, and there was no longer any need to replace her with another operative. Naturally he wouldn\u2019t waste his resources by planting another informant inside GenHance, not when his daughter was coming home.</p><p>If she came home.</p><p>King dialed another number. \u201cMr. Meriden,\u201d he said as soon as the other man answered. \u201cHave you found my daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have some new leads,\u201d the bounty hunter replied. \u201cI\u2019m going out this morning to follow up. The rest you\u2019ll get in my report tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid your term of employment is coming to an end more rapidly than I had anticipated. You will deliver Alana to me in forty-eight hours, or your contract will be terminated.\u201d</p><p>Meriden uttered an ugly laugh. \u201cThen kill me now, King, because I haven\u2019t found her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you need some additional motivation.\u201d He picked up the latest surveillance report and scanned through it quickly. \u201cDid you enjoy your evening with Ms. Dietrich? I could make you the last man she ever invites into her bed.\u201d</p><p>His voice turned to stone. \u201cYou leave her out of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen find Alana, Mr. Meriden,\u201d he snapped. \u201cYou have two days left, and then Ms. Dietrich dies.\u201d</p><p>Rowan woke up to find herself alone, and frowned as she sat up and looked around the room. She was back in her apartment and there was no sign of Sean. He hadn\u2019t even bothered to leave her a note.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t call, you don\u2019t write . . .\u201d she sighed as she got up, limping a little as she went out to the kitchen, where she found a small bag of powdered-sugar-covered doughnuts, a Coke, and a pile of folded clothes. The clothes turned out to be every stitch she had been wearing when she\u2019d gone over to Sean\u2019s apartment last night.</p><p>\u201cI love this man.\u201d She grinned as she tore open the bag and helped herself to one of the minidoughnuts that were among her favorite secret pleasures. \u201cAnd I think he is psychic.\u201d</p><p>Feeling a little sore from last night\u2019s frolicking\u2014and this morning\u2019s, she reminded herself\u2014Rowan retreated to the shower, where she stood for a good thirty minutes under a hot spray. It was ridiculous, how good feeling sore felt. She had whisker burns all over her breasts, finger bruises blooming on each hip, and something that felt like a bite mark on her right shoulder. Her limbs weren\u2019t stiff, but loose, with that faint, satisfying ache left over from sex.</p><p>If she could call what they\u2019d done to each other mere sex, she thought as she dried off, and saw in the mirror some other marks he\u2019d left on her. She\u2019d bet good money he had a nice set of matching scratches running along either side of his spine, and a couple of nip marks inside his thighs and along the curve of his jaw. It was silly, but for the first time in her life she couldn\u2019t remember exactly how many orgasms she\u2019d had. From the stupid smile that seemed to be permanently plastered on her mug, she was sure it was somewhere in the double digits.</p><p>Of course, part of it was because she hadn\u2019t shifted last night.</p><p>Rowan had known it was wrong to pry into his brain, but after their last bout of lovemaking she simply had to know. She\u2019d gotten up to get the hand mirror she carried in her bag and then had come back to Sean, kneeling down and holding his wrist while she looked into the hand mirror and shifted.</p><p>Only she hadn\u2019t shifted.</p><p>For the first time in her life, the dreamveil hadn\u2019t fallen over her. Her body had simply refused to shift. She stayed in her own form, not a single muscle popping or bone stretching. And there was only one reason that would happen.</p><p>She was Sean Meriden\u2019s ideal woman, and he was in love with her. Her, Rowan Dietrich. Not someone else she\u2019d become with the dreamveil.</p><p>Tonight, after her shift, she\u2019d have to do something special for her guy to show her appreciation. Maybe throw together a midnight feast for the two of them after closing. Sean might think he was happiest with pizza and beer, but he\u2019d never tasted what she could do with lamb and white beans.</p><p>The thought of cooking for Sean made her own belly rumble, but the only fruit she had on hand were some plums, which she devoured in a couple of bites. Seeing that she didn\u2019t have time for much else, she made a quick sandwich and carried it downstairs.</p><p>Lonzo was already in the kitchen, standing and inspecting her station. He eyed her sandwich with a frown.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the sous-chef in the best French restaurant in the city, and you\u2019re eating PB and J?\u201d He sniffed.</p><p>\u201cBest PB and BB in the city.\u201d Rowan held out one half, which he took and cautiously examined before taking a bite.</p><p>\u201cNot bad.\u201d He chewed. \u201cWhat\u2019s this BB?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBanana-pecan butter,\u201d she said, finishing her last bite. \u201cI make it myself. The ground pecans give it more texture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to try it on my wife,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a nut for the PB.\u201d He handed her an apron before tying on his own. \u201cKind of sudden, him moving you up like this. I know Danz; he thinks you\u2019re ready \u2019cause I taught you good. Me?\u201d He waffled his hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t poison anyone last night,\u201d she felt she had to point out. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my idea, Chef. I\u2019d have been happy with helper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonzo,\u201d he corrected. \u201cYou\u2019re not our tournant anymore, Trick.\u201d</p><p>Rowan was surprised at the welling of affection she felt toward the older man. \u201cDon\u2019t give up the search for a new sous-chef. I\u2019m not going to be around much longer.\u201d And suddenly her night with Sean didn\u2019t seem quite as wonderful and amazing as it had a few minutes ago.</p> <p>When she left New York, she\u2019d have to leave him, too. \u201cYou know what you can do here?\u201d Lonzo was asking her. \u201cThe name you can make for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know. But this\u201d\u2014she gestured around them\u2014\u201cthis was never meant for me. Maybe in my next life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDansant ain\u2019t gonna like it,\u201d he warned.</p><p>And there was her other problem. \u201cHe knew I\u2019d be moving on someday. Someday\u2019s just got here sooner than later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, you want to come and bunk at my place for a couple weeks, we got a spare room,\u201d Lonzo said awkwardly. \u201cYou know. If things get tight or Dansant gives you the business.\u201d</p> <p>She could have kissed him, and nearly did. \u201cI just heard from a friend of mine,\u201d she confided. \u201cHe\u2019s going to help me out. But I appreciate the offer.\u201d She winked. \u201cChef.\u201d</p><p>It was a little harder for her to be so lighthearted when Dansant arrived at the restaurant that night. He was very late; coming in just as they\u2019d plated the first orders, he came directly to her station to check her prep. She was working skate saut\u00e9ed in clarified butter, arranging it like a fan with ribbon-shaped scrolls of wilted, sesame-seed-studded spinach and her own fruit-vegetable salsa.</p><p>\u201cAnother interesting variation,\u201d he said, looking over her shoulder. \u201cVigato at the Apicius in Paris uses green apples and bell peppers in his recipe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVigato uses ketchup and soaks his spinach in vinaigrette.\u201d She wiped the edge of the plate with her hand towel to remove some drippings from the transfer of the skate from the pan. \u201cI\u2019m not doing his sherry vinegar reduction, either. Cider vinegar works better, and even when it\u2019s reduced it doesn\u2019t stomp the taste of the skate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t, Chef,\u201d Lonzo said as he passed them carrying a pan of chopped, quivering golden aspic.</p><p>Rowan handed the plates she\u2019d finished to the expediter and turned to him. \u201cCan I have a minute with you in your office?\u201d</p> <p>Dansant checked the line, nodded, and followed her back. As soon as they were alone, she looked at him squarely.</p><p>\u201cI am having my chef\u2019s table tomorrow night,\u201d Dansant said before she could open her mouth. \u201cI would like you to share the cooking and the meal with me and my friends.\u201d</p><p>He was not going to make this easy at all. \u201cI don\u2019t think the line can spare me.\u201d Rowan tucked her thumbs in her pockets. \u201cI need to tell you something. I spent last night with Sean. The guy who lives upstairs,\u201d she added, since they hadn\u2019t met.</p><p>His face lost all expression. \u201cDid you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just happened.\u201d She forced a smile, which didn\u2019t last longer than a few seconds. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m involved with him now. After what happened between us in the kitchen, I thought I should tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could uninvolve yourself,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo point. I heard from a friend who owes me some money,\u201d she lied. \u201cHe\u2019s going to lend me enough to cover what I owe you, and then I\u2019m leaving. I don\u2019t know when, exactly, but I\u2019ll give you as much notice as I can.\u201d</p><p>He studied her face. \u201cIt does not matter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDansant.\u201d She felt frustrated. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. After last night, I know you had some, ah, expectations. It\u2019s just you and me . . . we would never work out. This guy, Sean, he\u2019s more my type. Don\u2019t be pissed, okay?\u201d</p><p>He smiled then, a warm and beautiful smile. \u201cI am not angry, Rowan. I am happy for you.\u201d He took her hand in his. \u201cYou deserve to be loved. If not by me, then by someone who can care for you as I would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean\u2019s a good guy,\u201d she agreed, feeling a little uneasy, \u201cbut it\u2019s just for now. You know, no big thing. You, on the other hand, are going meet a great girl someday.\u201d Suddenly she knew what to do, and encircled his wrist with her fingers.</p><p>The dreamveil always changed her into the woman most loved by the person she touched. But occasionally she used it on men who hadn\u2019t met that woman yet, and when her body shifted she took on the form of the woman they would love most in the future. It freaked her out a little, and made her question just how random love really was, but at least if Dansant hadn\u2019t fallen in love before now, she could give him a preview of who was waiting for him in the future.</p><p>She pulled from him, and that was when things went bizarre. She not only got nothing; her body wouldn\u2019t change.</p><p>\u201cI have met her.\u201d He brushed his fingers against her cheek and left.</p><p>Rowan\u2019s legs buckled, and she groped until she found the edge of the desk and clung to it. Her ability hadn\u2019t failed her since the night it had first manifested. She\u2019d been able to shift into any woman who had been most loved by the person she touched. The dreamveil had never failed her once. Now, in the space of a single day, it had failed her twice.</p><p>How does someone like me know if any guy really cares? She\u2019d asked Drew that just before they\u2019d said good- bye, that last night in Savannah.</p><p>He\u2019d grinned. That\u2019s easy. When he holds your hand, you won\u2019t change into Angelina Jolie.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t changed into Angelina when she\u2019d touched Sean Meriden last night. She hadn\u2019t changed into anyone. She hadn\u2019t because she discovered that she was the great love of Meriden\u2019s life.</p><p>Just as she now knew she was Jean-Marc Dansant\u2019s.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Rowan got through the rest of her shift. Somehow. She spent a lot of time silently arguing with the knowledge that not one but two men were in love with her. Theoretically it was possible; plenty of people fell in love more than once in their lives. What was to prevent two men from taking the fall for her?</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s stopped working, she thought, and felt a kind of panic she\u2019d never expected. Her ability had caused all kinds of damage to her ego, but it had always been useful, especially in some hairy situations. Finally she threw down her towel, called to Enrique, and pulled him out the back door of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, Mees Trick? I mean, Chef?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand right there.\u201d She positioned him so that his back was to the kitchen and her dim reflection showed in one of the windows. \u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>Enrique did, and she pulled on him, and her body began to shift. A few moments later a dusky, gorgeous African-American girl stared back at her from the surface of the window. And lo and behold, she was suddenly the proud owner of a rack that would make a strong man weep.</p><p>\u201cTakeisha?\u201d Enrique murmured, his eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cYou really like me?\u201d she asked him in a low, musical voice. \u201cYou should tell me, amigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed, I should.\u201d He looked dazed.</p><p>Rowan stopped pulling on him, and her body resumed its normal dimensions. As she shifted back, his expression cleared, along with the memory from his mind of what she had just done\u2014another odd but routine aftereffect of the dreamveil.</p><p>\u201cChef?\u201d He frowned. \u201cYou need me haul trash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Enrique.\u201d She patted his shoulder. \u201cI thought I saw a dead rat out here. It\u2019s gone. Go back inside.\u201d</p><p>She was about to follow him in when she heard a shuffling sound behind her. She turned and saw the homeless kid stepping into the light.</p><p>\u201cI know what you are,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw what you did.\u201d</p><p>Rowan swore under her breath. \u201cIt\u2019s just a magic trick.\u201d</p><p>The girl shook her head, and then held out her arm, yanking back her sleeve and stepping further into the pool of light. She had an old tattoo of a blue ram on her arm, one that had a faint iridescent glow to it.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d she asked the girl.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The sleeve went back down. \u201cI\u2019ve always had it. There\u2019s one on my other arm just like it.\u201d She jerked her chin toward Rowan\u2019s sleeve. \u201cLike yours.\u201d</p><p>There was something maddeningly familiar about her voice, Rowan thought, but she was far too young to be Takyn. The only other one of their kind who was younger than Rowan was Judith, and she was twenty. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What am I?\u201d the girl demanded. \u201cWho made me like this? Why can\u2019t I stop it?\u201d</p><p>Her anger bewildered Rowan. \u201cStop what? What\u2019s happening to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Two wet streaks cleared a path on either side of her dirty face. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I be like you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember what happened to make you like this?\u201d Eager now, Rowan took hold of her arm. \u201cWhere were you raised? Was it a lab? Did you run away? Do you know where it was?\u201d</p><p>The girl wrenched away. \u201cThere was no lab. I\u2019m not a freak.\u201d Disgust filled her expression. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about me.\u201d She spun and took off.</p><p>Shit, she\u2019d spooked her.</p><p>This time Rowan had no intention of letting the kid vanish. She ran after her, moving as silently as she could, avoiding the obstacle-course-style escape route the girl followed. The kid was fast, but she was upset, and she never looked back. That allowed Rowan to follow her up to an abandoned hotel, where the girl went to the boarded-up front door, moving two boards to open a hole. After she climbed in, the boards creaked back into place.</p><p>She started to go across the street, and then stopped in her tracks. The old hotel was probably where the girl hid out and slept, and if she went in after her the runaway would no longer consider it safe to stay. If she ran from here, she\u2019d never come back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Retreating a safe distance from the hotel, Rowan took out her cheap mobile and dialed the number Paracelsus had sent her. It went to voice mail, which meant he wasn\u2019t in a place where he could speak to her freely.</p><p>She\u2019d have to word the message carefully in the event someone else picked up his phone. \u201cThis is Dee from Aphrodite Dry Cleaning. We have two orders ready for immediate pickup. Would you call back at your earliest convenience, sir? Thank you.\u201d</p><p>She ended the call and headed back to the restaurant, where she found Dansant standing in the alley.</p> <p>\u201cHi.\u201d She\u2019d taken off at the busiest time of night, she realized. \u201cI had to, um, take a walk. Get some fresh air.\u201d</p><p>He looked her over. \u201cYou\u2019re covered in snow.\u201d</p><p>That she was. She shook out her hair, brushed off her clothes, and smiled. \u201cBetter.\u201d</p><p>He gave her another long look before he went back inside.</p><p>The entire line was working furiously to make up for her absence, but Rowan knew better than to babble excuses or try to make apologies when they were in the weeds. She washed her hands and went back to her station, trying not to feel the angry glares at her back as she worked.</p> <p>It took the better part of an hour to catch up with the orders, but Dansant took out some gratis appetizers and amuse-bouches to placate the waiting diners. Rowan didn\u2019t take another break for the rest of the night, and kept working by finishing the cleanup while the other line cooks ate together and rested.</p><p>Lonzo stayed behind to vent his spleen, and Rowan stood silently and took it as her due. When he was finished calling her seven kinds of a lazy broad who didn\u2019t know her ass from any sort of depression in the ground, and offered his opinion of her state of mind, her value to the restaurant, and the dismal potential of any future offspring she might produce, he told her to report an hour early the next day to make close, personal acquaintance with the next delivery of squid. Then he let her make her official apology, accepted it against his better judgment, and went home whistling.</p><p>Dansant had his turn next. \u201cYou did not deserve that.\u201d \u201cNot all of it. Maybe seventy- five percent.\u201d She recalled she was speaking to the owner of the restaurant that, according to Lonzo, she might as well have set fire to. \u201cI am sorry that I was so inconsiderate tonight, Chef.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a run-in with that homeless kid who hangs around the alley.\u201d She blew out a breath. \u201cShe\u2019s in trouble, and I thought I could help. But she rabbited on me, and I went after her.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou pursued this child in the snow, in the streets, in the middle of the night?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the middle of the night. It was ten o\u2019clock.\u201d Oh, that made all the difference. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Nothing happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot run about the streets by yourself at night,\u201d he told her. \u201cAs we both well know, it is not safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you, my mother?\u201d She didn\u2019t know why she was so angry, and tried to clamp down on her temper. \u201cI appreciate the concern, but I can take care of myself, Dansant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the streets. I used to live on them, remember?\u201d She turned her back on him. \u201cJust let it go. I\u2019ll clean squid until everyone feels better about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are like a child.\u201d He spun her around, and he wasn\u2019t Dansant anymore; he was some dark, furious stranger with rough hands that dragged her up off her toes. \u201cYou run about as if all the world were blind to you. They see you, Rowan. They see how lovely and young and vulnerable you are, and they know they will never have someone like you. It drives them mad. It makes it easy for them to give in to their urges. When you don\u2019t think of these things, when you run off like that, you make it easy for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I ever had a choice?\u201d There went her temper, right out the window. \u201cWhen I was a kid, my mother went crazy. One night she just snapped and came after me with a knife. She almost killed me, and then she went and took a bath to wash off the blood, and slit her wrists. My father blamed me, and became a drunk, and I had to . . .\u201d No, she wasn\u2019t going to think about that. \u201cI ran away a year after she died. Since then I\u2019ve been on my own, and no matter what you think, I don\u2019t make it easy for anyone. I can\u2019t.\u201d She swallowed against the break in her voice. \u201cLeast of all me.\u201d</p><p>He brought her face to his and kissed her, hard and fast. By the time she went rigid with shock he had wrenched his mouth from hers.</p> <p>Dear God. That kiss had lasted all of ten seconds, but in that time he had taken her from furious to aching. All of her nerves were jangled, her ears buzzing, and she had her hands on him. She wanted him, right here, on the floor if need be. And that desire, that soul- shredding wanting, was as strong with him as it had been with Meriden.</p><p>Dansant swore in French and set her down. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your choice. I cannot stay.\u201d</p><p>Without another word he left her there to stand and stare after him, her heart pounding, her hands knotted at her sides.</p><p>Rowan knew then why she had become so angry with him. Why she bitterly resented everything she\u2019d said to him in the office, and every moment since. Dansant was wrong; she hadn\u2019t made a choice. No woman would choose this.</p><p>For the second time in twenty-four hours, she\u2019d fallen in love.</p><p>\u201cParacelsus?\u201d The counterfeiter squinted through his thick glasses at the business card. \u201cWhat kind of name is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne you will not forget, my friend.\u201d Taske collected the small stack of plastic cards, folded documents, and a brand-new passport. \u201cThank you for your excellent work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe identity won\u2019t hold up under a microscope,\u201d the man warned as he accepted an envelope of cash and thumbed through the edges of the bills. \u201cIt\u2019s only good for public use and to fool the cops. Your girl messes with the FBI or another agency, they\u2019ll rip it to shreds.\u201d He took another folder from his bag and handed it over. \u201cThe originals you gave me. I don\u2019t keep \u2019em or dispose of \u2019em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wise policy.\u201d He held out his gloved hand. \u201cUntil we meet again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, hopefully not in the joint.\u201d The man shook his hand and left.</p><p>Taske placed the keys to the motel room on the table before exiting himself. When he reached his car, which was parked two blocks from the motel, his driver met him at the back passenger door to open it for him.</p><p>\u201cThere was a call for you, Mr. Taske.\u201d He handed him his mobile. \u201cThey left a voice mail.\u201d</p><p>He checked the number on the missed calls list. \u201cThank you, Findley. Take me back to the hotel, if you would.\u201d</p><p>As they drove from New Jersey back to New York, Taske listened to the voice mail Rowan had left for him. He was not aware of any other Takyn residing in New York, so her request for him to pick up two \u201corders\u201d perplexed him. He called her back at once.</p><p>\u201cThanks for getting back to me,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cThe situation has changed. I\u2019ve found a kid who may be Takyn. I\u2019m not sure what happened to her, but for the moment she\u2019s homeless and pretty desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is this child?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMaybe sixteen. I know, she\u2019s too young,\u201d she said before he could speak, \u201cbut she has the tattoos on her forearms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t remind you how many people in this country voluntarily have their forearms tattooed.\u201d He didn\u2019t care for the way her voice sounded. \u201cAnd she is far too young to be one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if there were others after us?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey could have started the experiments again somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is always a remote possibility of that,\u201d he conceded, \u201cbut what makes you believe this child is Takyn? Did she demonstrate some ability?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Rowan admitted. \u201cShe saw me shift, though, and she didn\u2019t freak out. She doesn\u2019t seem to know anything about us, but I didn\u2019t scare her. She asked me some really strange questions, too. You remember, the kind I used to ask you when we first met online.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Who did this to me, where can I find them, how hard is it to kill someone, where can I buy a gun?\u2019 \u201d He chuckled. \u201cYes, my dear, I do remember. But until we can verify that this child is one of us, we must proceed with caution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know where she\u2019s squatting, and I think with some backup I can coax her out of there and talk her into coming with us.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cIf I\u2019m wrong, then we can take her someplace safe, get her the help she needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a compassionate heart, Aphrodite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s not being schizophrenic,\u201d she muttered. \u201cHow much more time do I have here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI purchased traveling identification for you tonight. Jessa will have something more permanent prepared by the end of the week. I expect you should begin packing up your things tomorrow, and if all goes well we will arrange our rendezvous for the next day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo soon.\u201d She sounded startled. \u201cOkay. Besides the kid, there\u2019s only one problem left. I haven\u2019t a fucking clue what you look like, P.\u201d</p><p>Taske laughed. \u201cI\u2019m rather hard to miss. Does that phone of yours accept photo images?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo cheap for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, you should be on the lookout for the tallest man in the immediate vicinity with silver-blond hair, a full beard of the same shade, dark Asian eyes, and a very inconvenient limp which requires him to employ a mahogany cane bearing the head of silver lion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. He sounds gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>He eyed his gloves. \u201cHe would gladly trade it all to be a short, dumpy accountant from Cleveland, I assure you.\u201d A tingling sensation in the base of his spine made him reach forward and tap on the divider glass. Findley nodded and pulled off to park the limo in front of a busy nightclub. \u201cI must attend to something else now, my dear. Keep your phone at hand, and I will see you soon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He handed the phone to his driver, gritting his teeth as the tingling sensation intensified to small spikes of pain. He hadn\u2019t endured an episode in months, but he hadn\u2019t been immersed in so much humanity in years.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish me to accompany you, Mr. Taske?\u201d Findley, a veteran of such episodes, watched him carefully.</p><p>\u201cNot this time, I think, Findley.\u201d A serpent of heat had coiled itself around his spine, but as much as it hurt, it also strengthened him. Only when it began to fade did he know he had arrived too late to take matters in hand. \u201cThis should not take too long. Stay with the car.\u201d</p> <p>Taske climbed out, removing his coat and placing it on the seat before he limped forward. The bouncer attending the velvet rope glanced at the car and then Taske\u2019s face before coming around to meet him.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Club Soleil, sir,\u201d the young man said, ignoring the groans and catcalls from the long line of people waiting along the sidewalk.</p><p>\u201cGood evening.\u201d An image formed in Taske\u2019s mind. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a friend. Has a young lady in a red-and-silver evening dress arrived recently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I let her through a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Taske pressed a hundred-dollar bill in the bouncer\u2019s hand, holding on to it briefly. \u201cCall nine-one-one and report an assault in progress. Quickly, my boy.\u201d</p> <p>The bouncer, whose eyes had taken on a glazed look, nodded slowly.</p><p>Taske entered the club and wasted no time looking for the woman. He could feel her heartbeat in his head, strong and steady, and used it as a guide. The rest of the club\u2019s patrons faded to shades of black and white as he limped through them.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d he muttered, turning his head from side to side. His attention became focused on a series of doors at the back of the place; the club\u2019s private rooms.</p><p>The pain snarling his spine flared as the heartbeat in his ears increased its rhythm to a frantic pace. It was happening, right now, and it pushed him along until he reached the center door, which was being guarded by a man in a suit.</p><p>The suit held up his hand. \u201cYou can\u2019t come in here, sir.\u201d</p><p>Taske didn\u2019t have time to negotiate, so he delivered a short, brutal blow to the suit\u2019s diaphragm, which knocked the air out of his lungs and drove him to his knees. Taske nudged him aside and went in.</p> <p>The man on top of the girl was well dressed, beautifully groomed, and had paid handsomely to reserve the room for himself and his guests. In it he had raped and killed six women in as many months. He had his hands around the throat of the one he intended to make the seventh.</p><p>Taske grabbed him by the back of the collar and lifted him into the air.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2014let go of me!\u201d The man struggled, swiping at Taske, who snapped his arm, tossing the man over the table and into the wall beyond. The man fell to the floor and lifted his head, then collapsed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right . . . Jessica.\u201d Now that he had her name, he bent to help her to her feet. Her pretty red-and-silver dress was torn down the front, and she was rigid with terror, but her attacker had not had enough time to do more. \u201cThe police have been notified. They will arrive shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow . . .\u201d She coughed, pressing a hand to her bruised throat. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d she finished in a hoarse whisper.</p><p>A question he wished he could answer, he thought as he led her out of the curtained room and off to the back hall where the club\u2019s offices were located. There he told her what he told all of them.</p><p>\u201cIt was not your time.\u201d The pain in his back had eased, but it had been so ferocious that he had to look. He stripped off his right glove, and took her hand in his. As soon as he touched her, he saw the bright thread of her life, stretching out far into the future.</p><p>No wonder he had been compelled to find her. Her timeline would affect millions of others.</p> <p>\u201cYou will not meet him in places like these. He will find you at a museum. In front of . . . a Picasso.\u201d He smiled a little. \u201cHis name is Harry, and he is an artist, like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike me,\u201d Jessica repeated softly, her gaze riveted to his face.</p><p>\u201cYou and Harry will have a good life together.\u201d He caught a glimpse of an event further along her timeline, the event that would change all the others connected to it. \u201cAs will your daughter and her husband, and their son.\u201d</p><p>He could tell her that her grandson would someday discover a treatment for a deadly disease that would save millions of lives, but she would never remember it. He could only plant the suggestion deep in her mind that would navigate her life toward the event.</p><p>\u201cWhen your grandson Charlie is ten years old, you should persuade his mother to give him the microscope for Christmas.\u201d That was the event that would propel the boy along his destined timeline, the single most important act Jessica would ever perform in her life.</p><p>\u201cCharlie. Microscope.\u201d She nodded thoughtfully, and when he released her hand, she blinked. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, mister, what did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must leave you now. When the police arrive, tell them you fought off your attacker.\u201d He smiled down at her. \u201cFarewell, Jessica.\u201d</p><p>Taske took the back exit out of the club, and by the time he limped back to the car, a squad car with flashing lights was parked at the entrance to the nightclub.</p><p>Findley stood waiting by the door. \u201cI trust everything went well, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time, yes.\u201d There had been other episodes when circumstances prevented his interventions, and an important life had been lost. When that happened reality shifted in subtle ways, and Taske\u2019s limp would grow a little worse for several weeks as he endured the pain of the loss.</p><p>Every person had a meaning and purpose to their lives, but some, like Jessica, had enormous impact on the future. If she had been murdered tonight, her loss\u2014and by extension, the loss of her future grandson\u2014would have altered the course of human history.</p><p>As he went to get in, Taske\u2019s bare hand touched the upholstered seat back, and the other half of his ability flooded over him. He blocked it as he sat down, took out his phone, and dialed Vulcan\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cDavid White.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you talk, my friend?\u201d Taske winced as two naked and too-familiar bodies appeared writhing on the seat across from him.</p><p>A faint buzz came over the line. \u201cI can now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a minor complication, Drew,\u201d he told him, ignoring the litany of obscenities being exchanged by the couple having sex in his car. \u201cOur young friend Rowan believes she has found another member of our extended family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s always good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis new discovery is sixteen years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s . . . definitely not right,\u201d Drew said on a chuckle. \u201cMinimum age for the Takyn is twenty. Rowan knows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem. Drew, I need you to do some checking on the acquisition of new properties by the Catholic Church within the last twenty years. Look for purchases of large parcels in remote, difficult-to-access areas where there are few roads and no local residents.\u201d</p><p>All the humor went out of Drew\u2019s voice. \u201cYou think they\u2019ve restarted the experiments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it is a remote possibility.\u201d He realized the images he was seeing were because he had forgotten to cover his bare hand, and after tucking the phone between his jaw and shoulder he pulled on his glove. \u201cLet me know what you find out as soon as you can.\u201d He ended the call, and then said to his driver, \u201cWould you mind terribly if I ride in the front with you, Findley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all, sir.\u201d Once Taske had moved to the front seat and they were back on their way, Findley asked, \u201cIs something wrong, Mr. Taske?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems our gardener has been making use of the car for personal encounters with his amour. Most energetic use.\u201d He sighed. \u201cA deserted island in the South Pacific becomes more attractive by the day, Findley. What do you think? Should we relocate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fishing would probably be wonderful, sir,\u201d Findley said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t imagine you living in a grass hut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d And now he would have to have a word with the damned gardener about his work ethic and poor choice of spots for his romantic rendezvous. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to be content with whatever the future may bring for me and the Takyn.\u201d</p><p>The driver gave him a quick glance. \u201cDo the others know, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I can sometimes envision the future as well as the past?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThe temptation to use me as an oracle would be too great.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAlthough I must say, you\u2019ve adapted to my eccentricities rather well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved my life, sir,\u201d Findley reminded him. \u201cIf not for you, I would have been blown to bits along with that mob boss who hired me from the car service in Chicago. That\u2019s all I ever needed to know.\u201d</p><p>Taske had never looked along his driver\u2019s timeline, but after that particular intervention he had glimpsed it stretching steadily alongside his own for many years to come. It was the reason he had confided in his driver so freely. \u201cI appreciate that, Findley. And if you have time tomorrow, please do me a favor.\u201d He glanced at the rearview mirror. \u201cArrange for a new car.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>While Rowan waited for Sean to get home, she went into the bathroom, faced the mirror, and rehearsed everything she was going to say to him. She couldn\u2019t stay, but she wouldn\u2019t vanish from his life without giving him some sort of explanation; he deserved better than that. She also knew it had to be short, sweet, and convince him to forget about her.</p><p>She stared into her own eyes. \u201cI\u2019m married, and I\u2019m going back to my husband.\u201d That was a good one, but she didn\u2019t wear a ring, and last night he had to know it had been a long time since she\u2019d gotten busy with anyone.</p><p>Rowan tried again. \u201cI\u2019ve got this disease and in a few weeks I\u2019ll be dead, so I\u2019m going into the hospital.\u201d That didn\u2019t even work on soap operas. \u201cI\u2019ve met someone else and I\u2019m moving in with him.\u201d That made her into an instant slut; effective but not to her taste. \u201cI\u2019ve fallen in love with Dansant.\u201d At least that was half of the truth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Despair settled over her as she braced her hands against the edge of the sink. No matter what kind of lie or truth she thought would work, she wasn\u2019t going to be able to say it, not to his face. It was too hard. She\u2019d have to leave D\u2019Anges today, find the kid, and hunker down somewhere else until it was time to move.</p><p>A clean break, no calls, no face time. There was only one way to do that.</p><p>Back in her apartment, Rowan grabbed a pen and some notepaper, sat down at the dinette, and began writing.</p> <p>Hey,</p><p>Sorry I won\u2019t be around to tell you this in person, but I\u2019m leaving. I messed up last night and got into it with Dansant, and now I think I\u2019m in love with both of you.</p><p>Rowan gnawed at the end of the pen. She should cross out I think; she knew she was in love with both of them. Jesus, just get on with it.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to hurt either of you, and I can\u2019t pick. I don\u2019t think you guys are up for a m\u00e9nage, either. So I\u2019m taking off with a friend. I\u2019m sorry, Farm Boy. Sell my bike when it\u2019s fixed and use the money to cover the repair bills. Take care and have a good life.</p><p>Love,</p> <p>Cupcake</p><p>She read it over three times, resisting the urge to tear it into a thousand pieces. It sounded stupid and wimpy and utterly inadequate, but it would have to do. She folded it and walked out to stick it under his door, then swore, stuck the note between her teeth, reached up over his door frame, and felt around until her fingers found the spare key.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t take anything important, she thought as she let herself in. Just something small that he wouldn\u2019t miss; something she could have to remember him on all the lonely nights to come. Maybe one of his flannel shirts, one he hadn\u2019t washed yet that still smelled of him. Then she\u2019d go downstairs and steal one of Dansant\u2019s jackets so that she\u2019d have that, too.</p><p>I keep falling in love, people are going to think I\u2019m a cross-dresser.</p><p>Rowan went to his bedroom, sat on the bed, and drew the tangled sheets up to her face. His scent was all over them, just as hers was. They smelled good together, she thought, and then she felt the tears coming on and jumped off the bed. She couldn\u2019t sit in here crying for what would never be. She had to pack, and she had to get the hell out before he came home.</p><p>She\u2019d seen one of his shirts hanging on the back of the chair by his desk, and after carefully placing the note on his pillow, she went out to retrieve it. As she put it on over her own shirt, she noticed a photo sitting on his desk beside a file folder. It was the picture of a little girl with blond hair and blue eyes.</p> <p>Rowan\u2019s hand shook as she picked up the photo, holding it the same way she might a grenade. She turned it over to check for a date mark, and saw the faintest series of marks along the edge. The photo had been cropped, so only the bottom half of the numbers showed, but Rowan already knew what they were.</p><p>11-7-1997.</p><p>Slowly she opened the file folder, and read the top page, a missing persons report filed in 2008 for a runaway teenager named Alana King. She was reported as being sixteen years old. As soon as she saw the girl\u2019s age, she picked up the file and began flipping through it, reading everything: the medical records, the police reports, the witness statements. Alana King had been undergoing psychiatric treatment. She\u2019d also had several elective surgeries.</p><p>\u201cYou sick bastard,\u201d Rowan whispered, throwing the file down on the desk as if it were covered with maggots.</p><p>Meriden had told her he moonlighted as a bounty hunter. The old man must have hired him to look for Alana. He doesn\u2019t know, Rowan thought. If he did he would never have taken the job.</p><p>She saw the blinking light on his phone, and picked it up to access his voice mail.</p><p>\u201cMr. Meriden,\u201d a wheezing, querulous voice said. \u201cI trust by now you are close to locating Alana. I thought I would remind you of the stakes involved. If you are entertaining some notion of going to the police, you should know that I am keeping Ms. Dietrich under constant surveillance. Deliver Alana to me by tomorrow morning, or I will have your lady friend killed before I deal with you.\u201d</p><p>Rowan switched off the phone. She had always known there would be consequences for what she had done eleven years ago. She just never imagined he would do this. And now she had to finish it.</p> <p>She switched on the phone and dialed 411.</p><p>\u201cWhat city and state?\u201d the automated voice asked her.</p><p>\u201cManhattan, New York.\u201d Rowan closed her eyes. \u201cGerald King, three-seven-one Riverside Drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne moment, please.\u201d A moment later the automated voice recited a number, and offered to dial it for her for a small charge.</p><p>Rowan hung up and dialed it herself.</p><p>The voice that answered was female, pleasant but professional. \u201cKing residence, Selah Baker speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Baker, I have a message for Gerald King. Listen carefully.\u201d Rowan told her everything she needed to know, and hung up before the woman could reply. Then she called Paracelsus\u2019s number and left a modified version of the same message without giving him names or details.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to come after me,\u201d she told her friend. \u201cThe old man\u2019s place is like a military stockade. His policy is to shoot first and ask questions later.\u201d She hesitated, and then added, \u201cIt\u2019s time I faced him. I guess I always knew I would in the end. So let me do this by myself, okay? People I love are going to die if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Outside the open door of Sean\u2019s apartment, the stairs creaked. Rowan went over to the door, expecting to see him climbing up, but no one was there. She did hear the back kitchen door, and wondered if he\u2019d been standing outside, listening to her give the message to Ms. Baker.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t have left if he had, she thought as she went to her apartment.</p><p>She ignored the bag she had been packing and instead took all the cash she had and stuffed it into her pocket. By the time she walked downstairs and out to the end of the alley, the cab she\u2019d called for was waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cWhere to, hon?\u201d the cabbie asked her.</p><p>The old man had waited all this time; he could go another couple of hours. Before she faced him, she would go and see the sisters, the only real family she\u2019d ever had. \u201cRiverpark Cemetery.\u201d</p><p>The long ride across the city took less time than she expected. She paid the cabbie, asked him to wait, and bribed him with a twenty to overcome his reluctance to keep the meter running. Then she walked into the little cemetery, past the modest headstones and plaques to a quiet spot back in the corner.</p><p>The headstone was, like everything in the sisters\u2019 lives, shared between the two of them. Rowan crouched down to trace the letters of Annette\u2019s name, and then Deborah\u2019s, which were wreathed by flowers. She\u2019d paid the stone company to chisel in the extra line on the stone: Beloved mother and aunt of Rowan.</p><p>\u201cI know last time I was here I said I wouldn\u2019t be back,\u201d she told the stone as she brushed a couple of dead leaves from the edge. \u201cBut shit\u2014\u201d She paused, imagining Deborah\u2019s frown. \u201cI mean, stuff, happens.\u201d</p><p>She sat down beside the stone and leaned against it, looking out at the other graves. \u201cI did pretty good after I left. I made friends, helped take care of some other people. Fell for the wrong guy, of course, but even that was okay. I didn\u2019t think it would happen for me, you know? And now, believe it or not, I\u2019m in love again. You were right, Deborah. There was someone out there for me. Just turned out to be two of them.\u201d</p><p>She reached down and rested her hand against the grass. \u201cI wanted you to know that I was happy, like you wanted me to be. I\u2019m going to stop running now. It\u2019s time. If things don\u2019t go okay, well, then I\u2019ll be seeing you sooner than later. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not going to say good-bye.\u201d</p><p>A bird flew down to perch on the headstone, cocking its head to stare at her. It chirped twice.</p><p>Rowan smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t try to talk me out of it, either, Mom.\u201d</p><p>The bird flew off as she got to her feet, gave the headstone a final touch, and took out her phone to make one final call.</p><p>\u201cSkylight Farm; this is Annabelle,\u201d Jessa answered.</p><p>\u201cAnnabelle?\u201d Rowan laughed. \u201cYou have got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDi, my God, where are you? Are you all right? We\u2019ve been so worried.\u201d She took a sharp breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Di\u2014I mean, Rowan. I\u2019m all hormones this month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I liked it better when we were Di and Jez.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to do this, but she couldn\u2019t go, not until she cleared her conscience. \u201cListen, I need to tell you something important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cParacelsus said he was getting you out of the city,\u201d Jessa said. \u201cYou can come to the farm now. Wait \u2019til you get here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t wait.\u201d She tightened her grip on the phone. \u201cMatthias had me infiltrate the Takyn group so we could identify the members. It\u2019s the reason I pretended to be your friend. To make you trust me enough to bring me into the group and start gathering information about you and all the others. I used you, Jessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She was silent for a moment. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped after a while\u2014you remember, that night in the chat room when we started talking about our families.\u201d Aka the worst and best night of her life. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie when I told you about my mother, and how she tried to kill me before she committed suicide.\u201d</p><p>Jessa made a soft sound. \u201cRowan, it wasn\u2019t your fault. You were just a little girl, and she was a very sick woman who didn\u2019t understand what we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Rowan smiled sadly. \u201cEven though I was still gathering info, well, that was the night I stopped pretending to be your friend and became the real thing.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cJessa, what happened after we took you from Atlanta . . . I thought I was in love with Matthias. That\u2019s why I used my ability on him, and I turned into you. And then when I saw you for the first time, and you were everything he wanted, the woman I knew he would love . . .\u201d she sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was so hateful to you in Savannah, and why I didn\u2019t tell you who I was. I know I\u2019m a liar and a bitch and I used you, but can you forgive me for all of that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessa\u2019s voice came over the line like soft, sweet music. \u201cRowan, you\u2019re my best friend. I love you, honey. I\u2019d forgive you anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She released a slow, shaky breath. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go and take care of some old business. If I don\u2019t get a chance to see you again, I just wanted you to know that I love you, and I\u2019m happy for you and Matt. And please, God, make him change your name to something besides Annabelle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowan\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She switched off the phone and pocketed it before walking back to the cab. The peace she felt settled over her, as warm as the sun, as tough as armour. She was ready.</p><p>\u201cThat was quick,\u201d the driver said. \u201cWhere you wanna go now?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to go, but she had to. \u201cRiverside and a Hundred and ninth,\u201d she told him. \u201cThe King estate.\u201d</p><p>Meriden opened his eyes shortly before dawn and found himself staring at the Bitch Madonna. \u201cHello, sweetheart. Miss me?\u201d</p><p>The painting glared at him, probably because he was completely naked. He went to the front closet, took out the duffel bag he kept there, and pulled out some clothes. No doubt Dansant had left him a note on the message board in the kitchen\u2014the asshole always did whenever he came to the apartment\u2014but when Meriden went to check it he found it empty.</p> <p>There was, however, shattered glass and splashes of red wine all over the kitchen floor.</p><p>\u201cLooks like someone had a party last night.\u201d He didn\u2019t have time to worry about whatever had pissed off Dansant; he had to track down Alana King. If he didn\u2019t find her by that afternoon, he\u2019d stop looking and focus on getting Rowan out of harm\u2019s way. He wasn\u2019t sure yet how he\u2019d smuggle her out without tipping off King\u2019s surveillance team, but whether he had to stuff her in a garbage bag or roll her up in a carpet, he was getting her out of the city.</p><p>Sean spent the day following up with every witness who had seen Alana King, but no one had remembered any new information. His canvass of the surrounding area also turned up nothing. He spent hours showing the age-progressed photo of Alana to everyone who worked around the coffee shop where she had been spotted, and it was then that he struck gold.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know this kid,\u201d the owner of a small electronics store said. \u201cShe don\u2019t come out during the day much, but at night I seen her plenty. Skittish as hell. She flops over at that hotel they boarded up. You know, the one with the family that\u2019s suing each other over ownership. Greedy bastards.\u201d</p><p>Sean wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cIf she\u2019s so skittish, how did you get close enough to see her face?\u201d</p><p>The shopkeeper smiled and hefted a complicated-looking pair of goggles. \u201cNight vision lenses. I use them when I do nighttime shoots. Keeps me from running into trouble in dark alleys.\u201d</p> <p>He wondered just what sort of photos the man was shooting. \u201cDid you happen to take any pictures of her?\u201d</p><p>The man shook his head. \u201cI post mine online for my, ah, Web site. You can\u2019t put up any of people unless you get a signed release from them.\u201d He winked. \u201cUnless you blur their faces.\u201d</p><p>Sean would have gone to the hotel to check out the man\u2019s claim, but he was running out of daylight. He drove instead to the restaurant, and called his answering service on the way to check in.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sean,\u201d Rita greeted him happily. \u201cHow\u2019s it going? You got the best messages tonight. We\u2019re all talking about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re that good, huh?\u201d He slowed down to stop at a red light. \u201cSo read them to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst one\u2019s from Mr. Dansant, and it\u2019s a scorcha. He made me write it all down, exactly like he said. He sounded really pissed off.\u201d</p><p>Sean grinned. \u201cSo what did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe message is, \u2018I know you slept with Rowan, and now she believes that she is in love with you. If you agree, tonight I will tell her everything, Miami.\u2019 Oh, wait. Diane wrote that wrong. It\u2019s \u2018mon ami.\u2019 \u201d Rita sighed. \u201cI know I\u2019m not supposed to ask, Sean, but are you in love with this girl, or is this just a fling?\u201d</p> <p>He spoke without thinking. \u201cI\u2019m in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, jeez, that\u2019s so romantic.\u201d Rita sounded as if she was on the verge of an orgasm. \u201cYou are the best guy in the city, I swear to God. Is she gorgeous? Are you buying her a ring? Can we meet her? Speaking of which, when are we going to meet you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hold off on planning the wedding until I get the rest of my messages,\u201d he told her drily. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one said her name was Taire,\u201d Rita said, her voice a little more stern. She spelled the name out. \u201cYou say it like it\u2019s short for Theresa or something. Anyway, she wants to meet you at the restaurant. She says she knows where the girl you\u2019re looking for is. I hope you\u2019re not keeping a honey on the side, Sean. Not a good idea if you want things to work out with Rowan, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just business.\u201d Although he couldn\u2019t recall speaking to anyone named Taire since he\u2019d taken the King case. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone called from your home number, but they hung up without saying anything. We just logged the call-in number a couple of hours ago.\u201d Rita sounded disappointed. \u201cMaybe it was Rowan.\u201d She caught her breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t think she knows about you meeting this girl Taire, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He pulled into the alley behind the restaurant. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go, Rita. Hold my calls for today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if Mr. Dansant calls again?\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cTell him I said he can fuck off.\u201d</p><p>Rita chuckled. \u201cSean, I could get like so fired for saying that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. Tell him Rowan is my business now.\u201d He saw a young girl waiting by the back door of the restaurant. \u201cTalk to you later, sweetheart.\u201d He climbed out of the car, and when he drew close to the girl he saw she matched the description Rowan had given him of the homeless girl. \u201cIs your name Taire?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re the guy who lives upstairs, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. How did you get my number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA girl gave me this.\u201d She produced one of his business cards. \u201cShe said you\u2019re looking for Alana King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where she is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but that girl who works here, Rowan, she knows,\u201d Taire said. \u201cShe was just in your apartment for a while before she left.\u201d She glanced at the windows. \u201cI saw her up there.\u201d</p><p>Sean was tempted to run upstairs, but he had to find Rowan and get her stashed someplace safe. \u201cWhich way did she go?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cShe probably went down to this place where she goes by the river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but she walks down there a lot,\u201d Taire said. \u201cI followed her a couple times.\u201d She gave his car a hopeful look. \u201cIf you drive I can show you where.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He went to the car and unlocked the passenger door. \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>As he drove toward the river, Sean glanced at the girl, who had flipped down the visor to look in the mirror while she brushed out her tangled curls and fluffed her bangs. \u201cYou\u2019re sure Rowan walked toward the river?\u201d</p><p>Taire nodded as she searched in her bag and retrieved a lipstick. \u201cShe probably went to meet Alana. They\u2019re friends, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they?\u201d Sean recognized the lipstick; it was one Rowan left on the shelf in the bathroom they shared. The brush belonged to her, too. \u201cHow did Rowan become friends with someone like Alana King?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe used to live in her house.\u201d She pouted at the mirror before turning and smiling at him. \u201cDo you think this is too red for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes you look very grown-up.\u201d Sean recalled the age progression he\u2019d done on Alana King\u2019s childish face. Taire bore a faint resemblance to what Alana would have looked like as a teenager, but there was something off about her features. Her nose was a fraction too short, and her eyes weren\u2019t the exact same shape. \u201cDo you know Alana King?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve seen pictures of her.\u201d She smoothed back her curls, revealing a long, faint scar running just along the curve of her jawline. \u201cShe was the most beautiful woman in the world.\u201d</p><p>He saw the dark roots at the base of her blond hair that she was trying to disguise by fluffing it. \u201cWas she.\u201d</p><p>Taire nodded. \u201cShe was perfect. I mean, she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho showed you the pictures?\u201d he asked carefully.</p><p>She sighed as she tucked away the lipstick. \u201cFather did. He wanted me to grow up to be just like her. That\u2019s why he had them dye my hair blond, and do all the operations. My face and my body, they weren\u2019t good enough.\u201d She turned to him. \u201cDo you know Rowan doesn\u2019t even need operations? She can just change into Alana anytime she wants.\u201d</p><p>The girl was obviously unbalanced, and Sean\u2019s mind raced as he tried to decide what next to do. \u201cTaire, maybe I should take you back to the restaurant. You could wait there while I find Rowan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves you,\u201d Taire said, sounding forlorn. \u201cThat\u2019s why I need you. To make her do it for Father.\u201d</p><p>Sean felt something slam him back into the driver\u2019s seat, an unseen force that held him pinned even as it took over controlling the wheel and the accelerator. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he said, trying to free himself.</p><p>She turned to look through the windshield. \u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Rowan heard the security camera swiveling on its base as she walked up to the side door. As she stood waiting, she noted three others performing sweeps of the side street, the river, and traffic passing by. She knew Gerald King\u2019s elaborate security system was even now zooming in to snap pictures of her hands, her face, and her clothes.</p><p>Some things never changed.</p><p>A thin, older man dressed in a dark suit opened the door a moment later. \u201cWelcome, miss,\u201d he said as he stepped back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She walked past him into the long hall. The air inside was warmer but smelled sterile, as if she\u2019d just stepped into a void. Hepa-filters in every duct, she guessed, along with electronic dust-zappers and God only knew what else. A speck of dirt wouldn\u2019t survive long within these walls.</p><p>\u201cMay I take your jacket?\u201d the butler was asking.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs you wish. Mr. King is in the master suite.\u201d He gestured toward the hall to the right. When she didn\u2019t move, he added, \u201cHe\u2019s expecting you, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She shoved her hands in her pockets and strode down the hall, which ended at the double steel doors of a private lift. That took her up five flights to the top floor, where she stepped out into one of the most beautiful rooms in Manhattan.</p><p>The antiques dated back to the turn of the century, but the art hanging on the polished cherry wall panels was much older. She eyed the brooding masterful Renoir hung between a complicated da Vinci sketch and a serene Raphael Madonna before walking across priceless Syrian rugs to the open arch leading into the next chamber.</p><p>With all the pricey, impressive stuff displayed in the receiving room, the master suite seemed almost bare. A plain four-poster bed stood against one wall, and a complicated computer system neatly arranged on an extended black worktable took up most of another. There were no chairs, tables, or other furnishings; the only other objects in the room were various bits of portable medical equipment crowded against both sides of the bed.</p><p>The old man lay under the plain white linens, his balding head and thin face the color of ash. A few tufts of white hair stuck out over his ears, and the white bristles of an uneven beard tried to cover his lantern jaw and the lower half of his hollowed cheeks. Although his labored breathing rasped audibly, his chest barely moved. Only his eyes, two little espresso beans floating in bloodshot whites, showed any signs of real life.</p> <p>Rowan walked up to the end of the bed but didn\u2019t touch it. \u201cI\u2019m here, old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you are.\u201d The corners of his mouth tried to dig into his jowls. \u201cI never thought I would see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be dead by now.\u201d She studied the equipment keeping him alive. \u201cMaybe if I hang around for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI regret that I\u2019ve disappointed you.\u201d He lifted a hand with effort, and gestured toward the heart monitor. \u201cAs you\u2019ve guessed, I don\u2019t have much time left. It\u2019s an aggressive form of brain cancer, if you are interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d She shoved her hands in her pockets. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear.\u201d His smile was a ghastly thing, a skull\u2019s grin. \u201cWhat have I always wanted? Only your happiness, and my own.\u201d</p> <p>She produced the photograph she\u2019d taken from Sean\u2019s apartment. \u201cYou didn\u2019t waste any time in looking for me, or in replacing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one could ever take your place in my heart,\u201d he countered. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>Nothing he said would move her. \u201cI\u2019m sure you got my phone message, but in case I wasn\u2019t clear enough, here\u2019s the deal. You call your guns off Sean Meriden, and I\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very generous offer.\u201d He inspected her face. \u201cSeeing as you don\u2019t know what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know, old man.\u201d She would have all the time in the world to puke over it later, when he was in the ground. \u201cBut I\u2019m not doing it until I know that Sean is safe.\u201d</p><p>The old man pushed aside the linens and rose from the bed. The difficulty of the task seemed beyond him, and his face blanched as he placed his feet on the floor. He rested for a minute before straightening, and held on to the bed-post while he gasped in air.</p><p>Rowan didn\u2019t move a muscle. If he dropped dead on her now, she\u2019d ring down for champagne.</p><p>\u201cAs you\u2019ve surmised, I stopped searching for you several years ago,\u201d Gerald told her as he shuffled around the end of the bed. \u201cI had resigned myself to the situation and, with some alternative arrangements, made the best of it.\u201d</p> <p>Rowan wanted to hit him. \u201cI know all about your \u2018alternative arrangements.\u2019 How could you do all that to another kid? She could never be what you wanted, and you knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had hoped she would prove a reasonable substitute. Besides,\u201d he chided, \u201cit wasn\u2019t as if she had any sort of future. Her birth mother abandoned the girl a few hours after her birth. She would have spent her childhood in foster care. I gave her the life children only dream of having.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile you hacked up her face and tried to make her into a dead woman.\u201d Now she was going to puke. \u201cIf you found someone else to play Alana, why did you come after me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI discovered\u2014much to my consternation\u2014that while some things can be altered, others cannot.\u201d He propped himself against the end of the bed. \u201cSuch as the cancer my physician discovered growing in my brain. It was only after I was diagnosed as terminally ill that I realized what a mistake I had made by giving up the search for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought I\u2019d come back here and hold your hand? Stay with you to the end? Are you out of your fucking mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see your language has suffered immensely since leaving my care.\u201d He sighed. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that I did not appreciate the other gifts you possess. There is no one like you, my dear, and there never will be again.\u201d</p><p>The sick smell rolling off him\u2014a stomach-twisting blend of chemicals and rot\u2014didn\u2019t make her step back. The greed in his eyes did. \u201cWhere is the kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest notion.\u201d His upper lip curled back from teeth pasty with plaque. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t matter anymore. You\u2019re home again, my princess. You can give me what I want and need.\u201d</p><p>Princess. If he touched her, she was going to scream, and she wasn\u2019t sure she would ever stop. \u201cI want to hear you make the calls to pull your men off Sean. Now.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOf course I will. Just as soon as the nurse arrives and begins the procedure.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder. \u201cWhat are you talking about? What procedure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very simple blood transfusion,\u201d he told her. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take long. Thirty minutes or so.\u201d</p><p>Rowan looked at the medical equipment again, and saw the two long tubes that hadn\u2019t yet been used, and the tray of needles, swabs, and tape. \u201cYou want my blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to live,\u201d he corrected, \u201cand your blood is the only thing that can save me now.\u201d</p><p>Drew kept his footsteps light as he passed the novelist\u2019s room, but before he could reach his own the door opened and a head appeared.</p><p>\u201cMr. White.\u201d Brian Cantwell stepped out into the hall, his arm filled with a thick stack of pages. \u201cI thought that might be you. Do you have a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really need to get back to work.\u201d Drew silently cursed himself for ever speaking to the would-be author in the first place. \u201cMy thesis isn\u2019t going to write itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may find this of great value to your own writing,\u201d Cantwell said. \u201cI\u2019ve just discovered the most marvelous blog about writing. You\u2019ll never guess what the title is.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2018Words R Us\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaperback Writer,\u201d the other man said, beaming. \u201cExactly like the Beatles\u2019 song. I\u2019ve always considered that my personal anthem, you know. I think it\u2019s an omen, Mr. White.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt probably is,\u201d Drew said. Now he\u2019d have the damn song stuck in his head all night. \u201cI\u2019ll look it up when I have a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe sure to leave a comment on one of the giveaway posts when you do.\u201d Cantwell held up a paperback book with the naked, wet torso of a man on the cover. \u201cI did and I won a free copy of her latest novel. She even signed it for me.\u201d</p><p>Drew smiled, nodded, and began backing away toward his door.</p><p>\u201cAnd do come by whenever you take your next writing break,\u201d the novelist called after him. \u201cYou can read the first draft of chapter thirty-seven. The Orcs have just surrounded my paladin and his band of elven warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds amazing.\u201d He was almost there.</p><p>\u201cThey have a spell battle, and accidentally transform the Orcs into dragons\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Drew unlocked his door and darted inside, leaning back against it with a sigh. \u201cNext time, I swear, I\u2019m posing as an illiterate migrant worker.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at his own joke as he went over to the computer and booted it up. There were several messages from Jessa and Matthias, no doubt with details on Rowan\u2019s identity makeover and relocation. Another e- mail caught his eye; it was from Paracelsus. The e-mail itself contained a terse suggestion he play the lottery immediately.</p><p>He took out his mobile and muttered as he saw ten voice mail messages from Paracelsus waiting. He didn\u2019t bother to listen to them but called his friend immediately.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Aphrodite,\u201d Paracelsus said. \u201cShe\u2019s decided to go home and give herself over to her demons.\u201d</p><p>Drew knew a little about Rowan\u2019s background. As a kid she\u2019d run away from a wealthy, abusive father, and although she\u2019d never gone into details, she\u2019d always made it clear that she would rather kill herself than see him again. \u201cMaybe she needs to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what he did to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe forced her to become the image of his dead wife,\u201d Paracelsus said. \u201cThe same religious fanatic of a wife who thought Aphrodite was possessed by a demon, and who tried to kill her when she was nine years old.\u201d</p><p>Drew closed his eyes briefly. \u201cWhy is she doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father has made some very effective threats against Rowan\u2019s lover and her friends, which he is fully capable of carrying out.\u201d The other man sighed. \u201cShe never gave me her father\u2019s name, so she could be anywhere. I had hoped she had told you something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know she grew up in New York, but we\u2019ve never used real names, either.\u201d Drew thought for a minute. \u201cJezebel might know.\u201d He logged onto his system and tried to IM Jessa Bellamy, who fortunately was also online. \u201cI\u2019ve got her. Hold on.\u201d Quickly he typed out the situation and asked if she knew who Rowan\u2019s father could be.</p><p>J: She never told me his name, but once she mentioned that she had lived in a mansion. A very old one, in Manhattan I think. She said there were only two of them left in the city.</p><p>There are more than two mansions in New York, Drew typed back.</p> <p>J: There was something else about it. Now I remember. Freestanding. Her father\u2019s home is one of only two freestanding privately owned mansions left in Manhattan.</p><p>Drew sent her his thanks and promised to keep her updated before he logged off from the session. Over the phone, he related what Jessa had told him.</p><p>\u201cI know both of them,\u201d Paracelsus said. \u201cOne is being converted into a hotel. That leaves the King mansion. Rowan\u2019s adoptive father must be Gerald King.\u201d</p><p>Drew frowned. \u201cDidn\u2019t Gerald King die a few years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently not. I am going over there, but if it is as fortified as Rowan claimed, I will need some technical support.\u201d</p> <p>Drew was already opening the highly illegal program he used to hack into other systems. \u201cConsider me your personal assistant.\u201d</p><p>Taire guided the car into the garage. Driving it\u2014and raising the garage door\u2014had forced her to break the rules, but now that Rowan was here, Father would understand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ease up on you and let you out,\u201d she told Sean Meriden. \u201cYou have to go upstairs with me. If you try to run away, I\u2019ll squeeze you harder,\u201d she warned. \u201cI can break all the bones in your body if I want. All I have to do is think it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can,\u201d he gasped. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have to do this to me. I promise, I won\u2019t try to hurt you. Let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Maybe after I talk to her and explain things. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Taire pushed open the driver\u2019s-side door with a flick of her thoughts and then pulled back some of the force she had wrapped around Sean.</p><p>Some of her father\u2019s men came out into the garage with guns in their hands, but Taire made the bullets fall down to the floor and pushed the men aside like rag dolls. She had Sean walk in back of her as she went in, and after knocking out six more guards she led him to the elevator.</p> <p>\u201cThis is my house,\u201d she explained as the lift took them to the top floor. \u201cI grew up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Gerald King\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t have any parents. I just call him Father because he said to when we\u2019re around other people. When we\u2019re alone I call him Gerald, just like she did.\u201d She watched the numbers light up: 2, 3, 4, 5. \u201cI hope he\u2019s home. Sometimes Father goes on business trips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaire, you don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cI told you, this is my house. I live here. I don\u2019t have anyplace else. Father is all I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why were you living on the streets?\u201d he asked as she made him walk out into the hall.</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake, and Father got angry. He said I had to leave. Then I hurt one of his men and I ruined his car. I couldn\u2019t come back until I fixed things.\u201d She guided Sean toward her father\u2019s suite. \u201cAll he ever wanted was to see Alana again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaire, is Rowan his daughter? Is Rowan Alana King?\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him in surprise. \u201cNo, of course she\u2019s not. Rowan\u2019s like me. She was just the first. When she went away, Father got me to take her place.\u201d</p><p>Taire stopped outside the doors to her father\u2019s suite. She had never entered his rooms without an escort, and for the first time since she\u2019d left home, she felt uncertain.</p><p>She gnawed at her bottom lip. \u201cMaybe I should knock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go in,\u201d Sean suggested.</p><p>\u201cThat would be stupid. Father has lots of guns. He would just shoot you.\u201d After politely knocking on the door, she opened it and crept inside, pulling Sean along after her.</p><p>The nurse who came out of Father\u2019s bedroom saw Taire and dropped the tray she was carrying. \u201cWho are you? How did you get in here?\u201d</p><p>Taire was confused, too. \u201cWhat are you doing in my father\u2019s room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. King is very ill,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but he can\u2019t have any visitors now. You\u2019ll have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowan?\u201d Sean shouted.</p><p>\u201cIn here,\u201d Rowan called from the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cStop yelling.\u201d Taire opened the closet door on the other side of the room and pushed the nurse across the floor into it. She slammed the door shut and fixed the knob so the woman pounding on the inside couldn\u2019t get out. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Father is sick.\u201d She dragged Sean with her into the bedroom.</p><p>Rowan sat in a chair beside the bed. Father, who was in the bed, looked thin and ashen and didn\u2019t move. Taire forgot about everything as she rushed to his side and took his frail hand in hers. He looked as if he\u2019d aged fifty years since she\u2019d run away.</p><p>\u201cFather? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d When he didn\u2019t answer, she stared at Rowan. \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was like this when I got here.\u201d She glanced at Sean before she reached down and pulled out a needle port that had been taped to the inside of her arm.</p><p>Gerald King opened his eyes and looked at Taire. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found Alana for you, Father.\u201d She looked over at Rowan. \u201cYou have to take his hand now and change for him. Do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Alana, kid, and neither are you. My mother\u2019s been dead for a long time.\u201d She stood up and turned to Sean. \u201cWe need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>Gerald grabbed Taire\u2019s arm suddenly, and dragged her onto the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me to die,\u201d he told Rowan. \u201cGive me the transfusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy blood won\u2019t save you, old man,\u201d Rowan said. \u201cNothing will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather, please, don\u2019t get mad,\u201d Taire pleaded, at the same time trying to free herself from his bony grip.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he told her. As she stopped fighting, he turned his head to Rowan. \u201cMy physicians think differently.\u201d He reached under the covers, and took out a gun. Taire\u2019s eyes widened as he pressed it to her temple. \u201cPut that needle back in your arm and start the transfusion, or I will shoot her in the head.\u201d</p><p>Taire went still. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hurt me. You love me. I\u2019m your princess. You said when I got old enough you were going to marry me. Like the first Alana.\u201d</p><p>King spat in her face. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing like Alana. Why would I want you when I can have her?\u201d</p><p>Taire felt something blaze up inside her, a cold fire that devoured everything she felt. She looked at Rowan, who could have everything but didn\u2019t want it. She looked at Father, who had everything but didn\u2019t want Taire.</p><p>The walls began to shake.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Rowan reached out to the walls, losing her footing when the floor began to vibrate. Sean\u2019s arm came around her, dragging her back away from the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d She looked around wildly, trying to find the source. \u201cEarthquake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the kid,\u201d he said as he steadied her. \u201cShe\u2019s telekinetic.\u201d</p><p>Gerald King started rising out of his bed, the tubes feeding into his body snapping and the sheets falling away. He looked down at the runaway girl, his face contorted.</p><p>\u201cStop this at once,\u201d he said, trying to hold the gun in his hand steady. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this to me, Alana. I won\u2019t permit it. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Alana. I\u2019ll never be Alana.\u201d The girl straightened, watching the gun as it flew out of his hand and embedded itself in the door. \u201cI\u2019m Taire.\u201d</p><p>Several men armed with rifles burst through the door. Sean rammed into one who tried to knock down Rowan, and tossed him into the computer array. Sparks exploded from the ruined equipment as the man went down, but when Sean turned three of the men tackled him.</p><p>\u201cMake her stop this,\u201d Gerald hissed at Rowan. \u201cBefore she kills us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re her father,\u201d she snapped as she dodged a swing from one of the men. \u201cYou stop her.\u201d</p><p>The second swing connected, and Rowan went down beside Sean. She heard panels cracking overhead, showering down chunks of plaster and several glass globes, which burst like bombs all around her. She covered her head, and then felt the same push she\u2019d felt the night of the accident, which this time shoved her out of the way as the bodies of King\u2019s men went flying out through the doors.</p><p>\u201cRowan.\u201d Sean crawled over to her, lunging at the last minute to cover her with his body as noise filled the air and the ceiling collapsed on top of them. Dust and smoke choked her as she struggled to push away a beam that had Sean\u2019s still body pinned on top of hers.</p><p>\u201cSean? God damn it, Sean.\u201d She shook him, but he didn\u2019t move, and when she grabbed the back of his neck her hand came away wet with blood. \u201cOh, no. No.\u201d</p><p>Rowan struggled to her knees, squinting to see through the cloudy air. She saw the outline of the girl\u2019s form and called to her.</p><p>\u201cPlease, kid, that\u2019s enough.\u201d She curled over Sean as a wall buckled. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop now. The whole place is coming apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She turned toward the windows, which exploded outward. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me. He doesn\u2019t love you. There\u2019s nothing left.\u201d</p><p>Rowan saw Gerald King\u2019s body hovering just beneath the hole in the ceiling. He was unconscious, possibly dead. Beyond him the sky was turning purple.</p><p>An ominous rumbling started beneath them, deeper and lower, as if the mansion\u2019s foundation was beginning to shift and come apart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to live here,\u201d Rowan shouted over the noise. \u201cYou don\u2019t need him. You\u2019ve got me.\u201d</p><p>The girl glanced at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know my name.\u201d</p><p>Rowan struggled to her feet, staggering toward her with her hand outstretched. \u201cI know who you are. I was just like you. He did the same thing to me.\u201d</p><p>The girl shook her head. \u201cYou ran away. I never wanted to leave.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d Rowan got to her, and rested her hands on the girl\u2019s shoulders. \u201cHe only loved Alana. We were just substitutes for her. He\u2019s a sick man, honey. He shouldn\u2019t have done those things to us.\u201d</p><p>The girl looked up at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. You don\u2019t know how it was. How hard I tried to make him happy.\u201d Her voice broke. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who you are,\u201d Rowan insisted. \u201cYou\u2019re my sister. My little sister.\u201d Going with her instincts, she wrapped her arms around the girl and hugged her tightly.</p><p>The rumbling gradually died away, and the mansion stopped shaking. And then the only sound came from the girl as she clung to Rowan and wept.</p><p>\u201cShhh.\u201d She stroked the tangled curls. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay, kiddo. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p> <p>A gun fired, and her little sister jerked. She looked up at Rowan and tried to smile before her eyes closed and she crumpled against her.</p><p>\u201cYou son of a bitch.\u201d That came from Sean, who was struggling to his feet.</p><p>Rowan eased her down to the floor and looked into the dying eyes of Gerald King, who held the gun leveled at Sean\u2019s head now. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to touch her father to shift; her body still remembered the sick, obsessive love he had felt for his wife, and drew on it to change back into the image of her one last time.</p><p>As Rowan had hoped, it completely distracted him. \u201cAlana,\u201d he whispered, his mouth wet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a monster, Gerald,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cJust as I was. Now you\u2019re going to die.\u201d</p> <p>The old man bared his teeth. \u201cNot without you, Alana,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>\u201cPut down the gun.\u201d Sean stepped in front of her, shielding her and the girl. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gerald tried to get up, and looked down at his useless body. He struck a fist against his motionless legs. \u201cI\u2019m not ready. I\u2019m not . . .\u201d He glared up at Sean. \u201cYou can\u2019t have her. She\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Sean bared his teeth. \u201cShe\u2019s not a fucking possession.\u201d</p><p>Rowan heard the change in his voice, and saw her lover\u2019s back make a strange ripple. The smell of jacqueminot flooded the dusty air, and it seemed to be coming from him.</p><p>\u201cSean?\u201d Her eyes widened as his body began to change, his shoulders lifting, his torso narrowing. The close-cropped blond hair on his skull erupted into a curtain of black that hung down to his shoulders. When he looked back at her, the chiseled angles of his tough face began to soften and flow, changing into more refined, elegant planes and hollows. The midnight black of his eyes gradually lightened until they were the light blue of heaven.</p><p>\u201cForgive me, ma m\u00fbre,\u201d Sean said with Dansant\u2019s mouth, in Dansant\u2019s voice. And then he was Dansant, Sean\u2019s clothes hanging like curtains from his leaner frame, and when he moved over to Gerald King the old man fired directly at him.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Rowan ran to him, but skidded to a stop as she saw a smashed bullet fall at his feet. She reached out and touched the hole in his shirt, and then tore it aside to look at his unmarked chest.</p> <p>She touched the place where there should have been a ragged, bloody hole, and then looked up into his angel eyes. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have never been sure,\u201d he said gently. \u201cBut I cannot be killed by bullets.\u201d He looked down at King, who had fallen unconscious, and bent to take the gun from his hand. \u201cOr madmen.\u201d</p><p>A very tall, broad man struggled his way into the room. He had a full head of silver-blond hair and a full beard of the same. His eyes were narrow and flat black, with a distinct Asian slant to them, and his skin was neither Caucasian nor African-American but something in between. He used a cane to pick his way across the floor.</p><p>\u201cParacelsus,\u201d Rowan breathed.</p><p>\u201cI see I\u2019ve arrived late. Hello, Rowan. It\u2019s lovely to meet you at last.\u201d He nodded politely to Dansant as he knelt beside the girl and checked her pulse. \u201cThis child is still alive. My car is waiting downstairs, and I know a surgeon in the city who can help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will carry her,\u201d Dansant said, bending down to carefully lift the girl into his arms.</p><p>Although debris littered the floors, and the elevator had locked down, they were able to make their way to the first floor by way of the emergency stairs. Paracelsus\u2019s limo was parked just outside, and when the driver came around to help them in, Rowan did a double take.</p><p>\u201cDo I know. . . .\u201d She studied his face for a moment and then slowly smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned. Jimmy Findley.\u201d</p><p>Findley tipped his hat and grinned. \u201cHappy to help bust you out of here again, miss.\u201d</p><p>Paracelsus\u2019s surgeon friend arranged to admit Taire to the hospital under an assumed name and personally operated on her to remove the bullet lodged in her back. The surgery took several hours, which Rowan spent pacing the breadth and length of the waiting room a hundred times. Dansant disappeared with Paracelsus, while Findley brought her snacks and coffee from the vending machines and kept her company.</p><p>Eventually she ran out of steam and nerves and sat down beside him. \u201cJimmy Findley.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, after all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cI took your advice and showed my mother those bruises, and she never let me go back there. She also wouldn\u2019t let my dad see me again until he quit working for Mr. King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never would have gotten out of there without your help,\u201d she said seriously. \u201cNot now, and certainly not when I was a kid.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019d have found your way. You were always strong. My employer is going to have a few words with you later about your reckless and foolhardy actions, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I imagine he is.\u201d She stared at the door. \u201cI\u2019ve got to have a little talk with someone myself.\u201d</p><p>Rowan was working on her fourth coffee and seventh package of peanut butter crackers when the surgeon came in to talk to her.</p><p>\u201cShe came through the procedure just fine,\u201d he told her. \u201cShe lost a lot of blood, of course, but fortunately the bullet just missed her kidney. She\u2019ll be in recovery for a while, and then we\u2019re going to move her to the pediatric surgical ward. Because of her unusual . . . condition, I\u2019m going to keep her sedated for twenty-four hours. You should go home, get some rest.\u201d</p><p>Rowan thanked him, and went with Findley to find Paracelsus and Dansant. The two men stood deep in conversation at the other end of the hall, but as soon as Dansant saw Rowan he broke off and came to her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d She related what the doctor had told her to both men, and added, \u201cI want to be back here tomorrow when she wakes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFindley and I will go back to the hotel to make some additional arrangements,\u201d Paracelsus said. \u201cI have the entire floor, so you\u2019re welcome to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRowan will be staying with me,\u201d Dansant said, and took her arm. \u201cYou have my contact information, Samuel. Call if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>When Paracelsus and Findley left, Rowan turned to Dansant. \u201cSamuel?\u201d</p><p>He led her to the elevator. \u201cThat is his name.\u201d</p><p>She waited until they were inside the elevator before she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine was lost to me,\u201d Dansant admitted, \u201cand Sean does not remember his birth name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Sean,\u201d she said, folding her arms, \u201cdoes he know you\u2019re a shape-shifter, and you\u2019ve been pretending to be him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Sean, Rowan.\u201d \u201cYou do a flawless impression of him,\u201d she conceded, \u201cbut you forget, I\u2019ve watched you change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not change myself into Sean Meriden\u2019s form.\u201d The elevator opened. \u201cSean Meriden and I are the same man. Or, rather, we share the same body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t.\u201d She folded her arms. \u201cI\u2019m a shifter, Dansant. I know how it works. You\u2019re good, maybe as good as I am, but there is no way in hell both of you share one body. It doesn\u2019t even look like the same body.\u201d</p><p>He muttered something in French and waved for a cab. \u201cI will tell you after we go to my apartment. It is a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, it always is.\u201d She climbed in the cab.</p><p>Dansant\u2019s apartment was like something out of an architect\u2019s wet dream, all clean lines and avant-garde style, and would have seemed almost sterile if not for the paintings on the walls.</p><p>\u201cFriends of yours?\u201d she asked as she eyed one portrait of a blond fallen-angel with vivid green eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I dream of their faces, and I paint what I remember.\u201d He brought her a glass of wine and gestured for her to sit on the squiggle of cushions that served as his couch. \u201cI don\u2019t remember my life before Sean, Rowan, so I probably have as many questions as you do.\u201d</p><p>She hmphed. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the windows. \u201cI have only an hour left before I change places with him. We have no memory of each other\u2019s activities, so it would be best if you stayed close, so you could reassure him.\u201d At her blank look, he added, \u201cThe last thing Sean will remember is being in King\u2019s suite and your father pointing a gun at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d She took a swallow of her wine before she felt ridiculous again. \u201cHow can you be two different men?\u201d</p><p>Dansant tugged back her sleeve to reveal part of the dragon tattoo on her forearm. \u201cI do not know for sure, but I think in much the same way you can be any woman.\u201d He pulled back his left sleeve, and revealed on the inside of his forearm a mirror image of the S-shaped dragon tat Sean had. The only difference was that Dansant\u2019s dragon was inked in blue with red eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust because you both have this yin-yang dragon tat on your arms doesn\u2019t make you Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\u201d she argued. \u201cIt\u2019s not even on the same arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonetheless, Sean and I bear identical marks, just as we share the same form.\u201d He spread his hands. \u201cFor this part of every night, that is me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShifting doesn\u2019t work like that. I know. I pull the thoughts from someone and use it to create the dreamveil,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you\u2019re not Sean Meriden pretending to be an executive chef. You\u2019re a completely different person. A separate person.\u201d</p> <p>Dansant nodded.</p><p>Rowan had seen a lot of weird things in her life, but nothing like this. \u201cSo how could you and Sean end up sharing the same body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have only theories, not facts,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut over the years Sean and I have come to some logical conclusions. It begins in Nice, with a man named Nathan Frame, who was married to the daughter of a chef.\u201d</p><p>Dansant told her the story of the accident, and the few fragments of memory Sean had retained of Nathan\u2019s past before he had come to France.</p><p>\u201cWhen Gisele was taken, she was put in a van filled with test tubes and biological samples. These were things taken from other people these men tortured. When the accident happened, Nathan ran into the fire to try to save Gisele. Then the van exploded and he was very badly burned. That must have been when one of the specimens entered his body, through his wounds, for pieces of the test tubes were found embedded in them. After two weeks in the hospital, he died of his injuries.\u201d</p> <p>Her throat tightened. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Dansant nodded. \u201cIn the moments after his death, I came to consciousness in his body. At the same time, his body spontaneously healed and changed shape into mine. I was not hurt or burned, and I knew I could not stay in the hospital and be discovered as I was, so I escaped and hid myself. Then, sometime after midnight, I lost consciousness. My body shifted again, this time into Sean\u2019s form, with his mind and personality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Sean is Nathan.\u201d</p><p>Dansant shook his head. \u201cNeither of us is Nathan Frame, although we both have some of his knowledge and characteristics. I acquired his cooking skills and love for fine cuisine. Sean inherited his mechanical talents and his fighting abilities. We both have some skill with weapons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Sean burned when you changed into him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFortunately, no. The first shift had healed him as well.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI am not Sean, and I am not aware of him. Upon my second awakening, when the sun set the next night, I woke to find myself standing on the docks looking at a boat. I was thirty miles from where I had gone to my rest and I could not remember how I had come to be there. My clothes were torn at the seams, as if a larger man had tried to wear them. Fortunately that portion of the docks was deserted at the time, and no one saw us change.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo sunset triggers the change from Sean to you, and you don\u2019t change back until after midnight,\u201d she said, to be sure she had it straight. \u201cYou have no memory of what he does while he controls the body, and it\u2019s the same for him. When you\u2019re awake, he\u2019s asleep.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe seem to have divided the best of Nathan Frame between the two of us, although physically neither of us bears any resemblance to him. Sean has a few fragments of his memory, but I have none at all. What we do have of Nathan\u2019s original form are these.\u201d He touched the tat on his arm. \u201cAccording to his medical file, Nathan also had a taijitu on each arm. One scarlet, one blue. Those, too, were divided between us.\u201d</p><p>She considered how a man\u2019s life and experiences could be split in half, and how much grief the division must have caused Meriden and Dansant. \u201cHow do you know all this about each other? If your minds are separated, and you\u2019re never aware of each other, how can you communicate at all?\u201d</p><p>He smiled a little. \u201cAt first we tried to leave messages with other people, but over time we have learned that they sometimes changed the message or even forgot them. Then we wrote notes and left them in our pockets, but mon fr\u00e8re does not always have the patience to write. When we came to America, Sean hired a twenty-four-hour answering service for his garage. It was my idea to call it and leave messages for him, and set up an account for myself so he could do the same. We have to be guarded in what we say, of course, but it has proven to be most effective.\u201d</p><p>Rowan chuckled. \u201cYou should really try e-mail.\u201d Her smile faded as she studied his face. \u201cYou really don\u2019t remember who you were before all this happened to you and Sean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I did, but no. My memory begins the night I woke in the hospital.\u201d He grimaced. \u201cThere are some clues about the sort of man I was. I speak many languages, some that are very old and no longer used, but French is the most familiar. I know how to handle weapons, especially blades, very well. As you have seen, I paint portraits and landscapes. They are people and places I have never seen, but still I know them.\u201d He touched his chest. \u201cHere, inside, I feel them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon. I only remember waking. I had thought perhaps my first body must have been destroyed by the men who took Nathan\u2019s wife, but then that woman came to me, the night you and I went to the opera. She called me Michael and kissed me.\u201d He gave her a troubled look. \u201cI was looking for you, so I did not pay much attention to her.\u201d He nodded toward the portrait. \u201cThat is the same woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMichael is a pretty common name, but at least we know what he looks like,\u201d Rowan pointed out. \u201cWhen it\u2019s Sean\u2019s turn to have the body, he can start hunting him down for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon, ma m\u00fbre. If the man I was lives, I have no wish to meet him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cannot know he was born again in another body. He has his life and his woman.\u201d He ran his hand over her curls. \u201cI have mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor eight hours a day.\u201d Now she shook her head. \u201cHow can you live like this? You didn\u2019t even get half days.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a wry look. \u201cRegrettably I was never consulted. But it is not so bad as you think. You sleep every night, and you do not resent the hours away from the world. When Meriden takes my body, it is much the same for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, that\u2019s another thing.\u201d She twined her fingers in his. \u201cNeither of you really ever sleeps, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSean does.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI do not seem to require it.\u201d</p><p>She tucked a long strand of his hair behind his ear. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid when he takes over that you might not come back the next night?\u201d</p><p>He considered that for a moment. \u201cI have always felt that it is Sean\u2019s body, not mine. I am grateful for my life, but I live it through his flesh.\u201d He sighed. \u201cAfter the accident, neither of us could accept it at first. Sean was too damaged in spirit, and I could not bear the thought that I had only existed as bits of skin and blood and bone. We still struggle with it, and we often resent each other. For example, he will not like that I was the one to tell you about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of Sean.\u201d She kept hold of his hand. \u201cI\u2019m in love with him.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also in love with you.\u201d As he stared at her, she leaned in and brushed her lips against his. \u201cWhatever problems you have with each other, you\u2019re both going to have to deal with that.\u201d</p><p>He looked stunned and pleased, and threaded his fingers through her curls. \u201cYou would choose both of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be two different guys, but you have the same heart. Literally and metaphorically speaking.\u201d She pulled him over on top of her. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you change into one man or two or nine. I want you. I want Sean. I want us.\u201d</p><p>Dansant braced himself on his forearms. \u201cDo you.\u201d He settled himself between her legs, rocking his hips a little so that his erection stroked her gently. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you since the first moment I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d She reached down in between them, unzipping his fly and pushing her hand inside.</p><p>\u201cRowan.\u201d He caught his breath. \u201cSean is your lover. He may not accept this. I love you, but I do not want him hurt. He is my brother.\u201d</p><p>It touched her that he was so concerned about his other half. \u201cWe\u2019ll be okay. Just let me do the talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that, I have no choice.\u201d He tried to lift himself away from her, and when she held on he frowned. \u201cI will change in a few moments. I cannot be with you when he emerges. It is too dangerous for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tougher than you think, Jean-Marc.\u201d She palmed him, enclosing him in her fingers and guiding him to where she was already wet and pulsing with the ache of emptiness. \u201cThis is the best way to tell him, you know. And when you wake up tomorrow night, we\u2019ll pick up where we left off. I promise.\u201d She lifted a little to seat him between her folds, and then tightened her muscles to draw him in. \u201cAnd if Sean doesn\u2019t cooperate, I\u2019ll just handcuff him to the bed and ravish him until he changes.\u201d</p><p>Dansant swore softly and shook as he sank into her another inch. \u201cDo you understand what happens? I will change while I\u2019m inside you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll hurt. And this way, I get to have both of you inside me.\u201d</p><p>He stroked into her, groaning as she clasped him with her body. As the sky outside turned dark gray, he began fucking her, driving himself in and out as she held on to his shoulders and cradled him with her legs. When his eyes began to darken from heavenly blue to midnight black he bent his head and kissed her, pressing in as deep as he could, and she came around him, her body arching as he pushed her over the edge of pleasure and into the darkness with him.</p><p>His body shifted in a wave that had no beginning or end but just swept out in all directions, like water swelling and spilling from a winter thaw. It was beautiful to see and feel. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dansant\u2019s long, sinewy muscles broadened over stretching bones, and his weight went from delicious to maddening as he twisted against her, his cock jetting inside her with frantic jerks. His long black hair receded to a pale blond stubble, his jaw lengthened, and his brows shifted from a sweep of wings to a menacing arch. As his hair lightened, the luscious scent of jacqueminot from his skin darkened, changing into something deeper and spicier. His expression went from taut delight to dazed confusion, and then he was Sean, his big hands pinning her down as he shoved himself deep.</p><p>\u201cHi, there.\u201d She gasped as he tangled a hand in her hair and brought her mouth to his. The kiss took what was left of her breath away, and when he lifted his head to look into her eyes, she curled an arm around his neck. \u201cIn case you were wondering, King is dead, the kid is in the hospital but okay, and we\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He looked down at their bodies. \u201cI can see that. But how did I . . .\u201d His expression darkened, and he lifted up. \u201cShit. Sorry I interrupted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d She put the other arm around his neck. \u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to fuck him, Cupcake,\u201d he said through gritted teeth, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to wait another sixteen hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Sean cupped her face with his hand. \u201cYou think I want to share you with him? Is that what this is all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already share a body with him,\u201d she pointed out calmly. \u201cWhat\u2019s one more?\u201d</p> <p>He turned his head, his jaw working. \u201cYou\u2019re not just a body to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither are you. Neither is he.\u201d She sighed. \u201cOf course, if we can\u2019t work this out, I can call it a draw and walk away. There are plenty of one-dimensional guys out there. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll meet someone else someday who will understand that you turn into a were-chef every night.\u201d</p><p>Now he looked at her. \u201cI was the chef. He was a bunch of fucking test tubes.\u201d He looked at her mouth. \u201cWhat does he say about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s worried about you,\u201d she said, kissing his chin. \u201cLike me.\u201d</p><p>He made a disgusted sound. \u201cSure he is. He was so worried he changed while he was fucking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him to do it, so you\u2019d know.\u201d She ran a hand over his short hair. \u201cHe also said he\u2019d step aside if you want.\u201d When he stared she nodded. \u201cHe knows it\u2019s your body, Sean. You\u2019ve got the final word here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d His expression thawed a little, and he rolled over onto his back, bringing her along to straddle him. \u201cBetween the two of us, you\u2019re not going to get a whole lot of sleep, Cupcake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like where I am.\u201d She worked herself down on him until their body hair tangled. \u201cAnd who the hell needs sleep?\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cLosing Hoff in that car accident was unfortunate, Elliot,\u201d Genaro said, \u201cbut Delaporte positively identified the remains, and brought back a DNA sample from the morgue to confirm. She\u2019s dead, as is Gerald King. Their deaths have closed the matter.\u201d</p><p>Kirchner wasn\u2019t satisfied. \u201cWhat about the heir to King\u2019s estate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sixteen years old,\u201d Genaro said. \u201cToo young to be Kyndred. Once she recovers from her injuries, she\u2019ll be shipped off to prep school and spend her summers with her uncle in Martha\u2019s Vineyard. I doubt she even knows how to spell transgenic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d The geneticist looked at Delaporte. \u201cYou should have brought in Hoff the night our team disappeared in New York.\u201d</p><p>The security chief shrugged. \u201cMr. Genaro wanted her taken here, in the building. I can only do what I\u2019m told, Doctor.\u201d</p> <p>The doctor\u2019s face darkened. \u201cYet somehow you still manage to screw it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you excuse us, please, Chief?\u201d Genaro waited until Delaporte left the conference room before he continued. \u201cDon Delaporte has been in charge of GenHance security for the last twenty-two years, Elliot. His loyalty to the company\u2014to me\u2014is unquestionable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was the last person to see Nella Hoff alive,\u201d Kirchner said. \u201cHe permitted Bradford Lawson free access to the building, which resulted in Lawson\u2019s theft of the transerum and the progenote. He also failed to detect or capture Andrew Riordan when he was spying on us. He\u2019s completely incompetent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is your prerogative,\u201d Kirchner said. \u201cBut how many more mistakes does Delaporte have to make before you see that he\u2019s a liability?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re becoming paranoid, Elliot.\u201d Genaro rose from the conference table. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take the rest of the week off, and spend some time with your family? Maybe that will put things in perspective for you.\u201d</p><p>Delaporte was waiting for Genaro in the analysis lab. \u201cDr. Kirchner seemed upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. He cannot reconstruct Nella Hoff\u2019s experiments. Apparently she removed some of her notes, or destroyed them.\u201d The chairman watched the simulation looping on the terminal screen. \u201cHe\u2019s decided that you are to blame for his lack of progress.\u201d</p><p>Delaporte nodded, unperturbed. \u201cThe doctor doesn\u2019t accept failure well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do I, Don.\u201d Genaro regarded him. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together a long time. I would consider it a personal as well as a professional loss if I had to terminate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll make it my business never to give you a reason to, sir,\u201d Delaporte said.</p><p>Several weeks after that meeting, Delaporte drove up to his cabin in the mountains to spend the weekend hunting. He invited Genaro to go with him, but the chairman had a prior commitment, and refused. The security chief spent the next two days tramping happily through the cold, un-welcoming woods and bringing down two bucks, which he skinned and butchered himself. He then invited a woman friend from a nearby town to stop in for a late dinner and a friendly romp in his sheets. He enjoyed the sex as much as the fresh venison.</p><p>On the drive back to Atlanta, Delaporte easily shook off the men who had been tailing him for the better part of a month before he stopped at a public rest area, and walked out to the picnic area to eat the lunch he\u2019d packed for himself. After he finished his meal, he took the phone taped to the underside of the table and carried it with him into the woods, where he found a spot where he could watch the road while placing the call.</p><p>\u201cI was followed up into the mountains, my lord,\u201d he told his master. \u201cI was able to elude them briefly, but I will be unable to report on a regular basis until the surveillance stops.\u201d He listened to the instructions he was given, and memorized an address and phone number. After that he made his only request. \u201cMay I speak with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Don,\u201d Nella said a short time later. \u201cHow are things in the States?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonely,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been writing letters to you. I can\u2019t send them, so I\u2019m boxing them.\u201d There was a hitch in her voice as she said, \u201cI expect the next time we meet, I\u2019ll have quite a stack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery night I think of you,\u201d he told his lover. \u201cI remember how you smell. The sounds you make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will it be before I see you again?\u201d</p><p>He saw a familiar car pull into the rest area parking lot. \u201cMaybe years. Don\u2019t wait, baby. Enjoy yourself. And stay safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too, love. Bye.\u201d</p><p>Delaporte switched off the phone, removed the battery and the sim card, and wiped it down before dropping it inside a hollow tree. The battery he dropped on his walk out of the woods. The sim card he mangled slowly inside his pocket; he wouldn\u2019t discard it until he reached home and could drop it in a container of acid he kept in his garage.</p><p>The men following him made a pretense of using the vending machines as they watched him make his way back to his car. He dumped his trash and stowed his cooler in his trunk before getting back onto the road.</p><p>He eyed in his rearview mirror the men hurrying back to their car to follow him, and allowed himself to feel a small amount of satisfaction. \u201cAmateur cocksuckers.\u201d</p><p>Taske found his driver working out behind the garage, waxing the limo in the shade of one of the estate\u2019s massive oak trees. \u201cFindley, can you spare a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d The driver put down his buffing rag and came around the car to join Taske and his new employee.</p><p>\u201cThis is Neville Morehouse,\u201d he said. \u201cNeville, James Findley.\u201d He waited until the two men shook hands. \u201cMorehouse will be taking over as house manager, as Mrs. Wallace and Mr. Rodriguez have decided to relocate to Miami.\u201d</p><p>Findley didn\u2019t comment on the sudden departures of the housekeeper and gardener. \u201cIf I may be of assistance during the transition, Mr. Morehouse, or at any time, please let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the offer, Mr. Findley.\u201d Morehouse\u2019s smile was faint but genuine. \u201cPerhaps you could assist me this afternoon in picking up my belongings from the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn excellent idea,\u201d Taske said. \u201cWell, gentlemen, I have several dozen calls to return. Morehouse, I will see you tomorrow morning at six a.m. Findley.\u201d He nodded and limped back toward the big house.</p><p>Once Taske was back in his home office, he checked over the documents he had brought back from New York before placing them in his safe. Along with favors called in from many of his associates in New York, Taske had once more employed his newest vendor in the forgery business, who had successfully seen to every document he had required to take over Gerald King\u2019s estate and assume guardianship of young Taire.</p><p>Rowan had insisted on remaining behind in New York to look after the girl during her recovery and make arrangements to reside in the city permanently.</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t think it\u2019s safe for me to stay,\u201d she had argued, \u201cbut this is going to work. If it doesn\u2019t, I will personally pack up everyone and relocate them myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Taske was more troubled about her involvement with the shifter who had stolen her heart\u2014twice. He was not convinced that a relationship between three people, two of whom shared the same body, could last. He\u2019d even been tempted to try to see how the three timelines converged. But in the end he had to admit that both of her lovers were decent men who cared deeply for her, and would provide her with the additional bonus of round-the-clock protection. So he had capitulated to her wishes, obtaining in return a promise to call on him if she was ever in trouble.</p><p>He placed his first call to Drew, who had decided to stay in Halagan until spring, after which he would head north. Until then he was going to research the circumstances surrounding Sean Meriden\u2019s accident, and trace the ownership of the van that had been carrying the biological specimens. Taske had a feeling that it would not belong to GenHance.</p><p>\u201cI need to learn French,\u201d Drew complained. \u201cMost of the records aren\u2019t in English, and the online translators just turn it into babble.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe careful to cover your tracks, my friend,\u201d Taske warned. \u201cWhoever tried to take Nathan Frame did not hesitate to murder his entire family. They won\u2019t take kindly to being identified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far all I have is a registration to some Italian doctor who disappeared in Nice on the same day the accident happened,\u201d Drew admitted. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be cautious. Whoever these guys are, evidently they\u2019ll cross any line to get what they want. So where are you off to now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I might spend the holidays in France,\u201d Taske said, looking at his gloves.</p><p>\u201cDoes Mr. Taske always rise quite so early?\u201d Morehouse asked casually.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d Findley said. \u201cThe first thing I bought when I started here was a very loud alarm clock.\u201d He gestured toward the second-story living quarters above the garage. \u201cCan I offer you a cup of tea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you would allow me to make it,\u201d Morehouse said. \u201cNo offense, but it is my country\u2019s national drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken, as long as you never try to make me coffee.\u201d</p><p>The two men went upstairs to Findley\u2019s apartment, which Morehouse admired as much as his new quarters in the house. While the house manager prepared the kettle, Findley went to into the small bathroom to clean up. By the time he returned Morehouse had the table set and the tea ready.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been living in the States?\u201d Findley asked as he sat down.</p><p>\u201cAbout four years now.\u201d Morehouse poured and added a spoonful of sugar to his cup. \u201cI hadn\u2019t set my sights quite so high as this, but when Mr. Taske opened the door, I ran through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man. I\u2019ve never worked for better.\u201d Findley gave him a measuring look. \u201cDon\u2019t carry a torch for him. He\u2019s straight as an arrow.\u201d</p> <p>Morehouse smiled a little to acknowledge the perceptive remark. \u201cI\u2019m not in the market for a wealthy lover.\u201d</p><p>Findley grinned. \u201cI hope not. Mrs. Wallace\u2019s scones will be greatly missed.\u201d</p><p>After Findley cleared the table efficiently, he accepted Morehouse\u2019s help at the sink.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I should know about the household?\u201d Morehouse asked.</p><p>\u201cMr. Taske is considered eccentric,\u201d Findley said carefully. \u201cHe travels quite a bit, often without giving much notice to the staff. He\u2019s meticulous, punctual, particular about details, and very generous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been carrying a torch for him?\u201d the house manager asked gently.</p><p>\u201cSince he saved my life.\u201d Findley turned off the taps. \u201cI guess I always will, at least in my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re young.\u201d Morehouse covered his hand briefly. \u201cYou should leave room for another flame.\u201d</p> <p>Findley glanced at him. \u201cShould I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne never knows what the future will hold.\u201d Morehouse frowned. \u201cDid I say something funny?\u201d</p><p>Rowan opened the door to the hospital room with her hip. \u201cIncoming overpriced floral arrangements,\u201d she announced as she peeked over the vases of wildflowers, roses, and orchids in her arms. \u201cI need major table space here, Terry. Clear the deck.\u201d</p><p>Taire grabbed her water pitcher and cup from the rolling table, and flicked a thought at a vase that was about to tip over. \u201cJeez, Trick, what did you do? Knock over a couple of gift shops?\u201d</p><p>She managed to set everything down without dousing the patient. \u201cI\u2019m playing delivery girl. The orchids are from Samuel, the roses are from Jean- Marc, and the wildflowers are from the large grumpy man stalking me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to carry some of the flowers,\u201d Sean told Taire as he started piling gift bags on the end of her bed. \u201cShe said she didn\u2019t need any help.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder before taking a grease-stained cardboard box out of one of the bags. \u201cMedium-thin-crust pepperoni and sausage, extra cheese,\u201d he murmured. \u201cShould still be hot.\u201d</p><p>Taire yelped with joy and tore open the box, ripping out a slice and sinking her teeth into it. She closed her eyes and groaned with pleasure.</p><p>Rowan gave him a dirty look. \u201cYou brought her pizza? For breakfast?\u201d</p><p>He leaned back against the wall. \u201cI\u2019d bring her a beer, too, if she was old enough to drink one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least I was thinking about her nutritional requirements.\u201d Rowan took a can of Coke out of her jacket pocket, which she opened and set beside the pizza box. \u201cTah-dah.\u201d</p><p>Taire swallowed, took a drink from the soda, and then looked from Rowan to Sean. \u201cWhat, no Snickers bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Be right back.\u201d Sean disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI love watching his butt when he runs.\u201d Rowan came around the bed, and when Taire scooted over climbed in beside her. \u201cSo I talked to the doc on the way in, and he says I can maybe bust you out of here on Friday.\u201d Before Taire could say anything, she held up a finger. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t pop any stitches, refuse to do your therapy, or give the nurses any grief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do extra therapy,\u201d Taire promised. Some of the happiness left her expression. \u201cWhere am I going to live now, though?\u201d</p><p>The King mansion had been declared unsafe for further occupancy, and since the heir to Gerald King\u2019s estate had decided to donate the land to a free medical clinic for underprivileged children, it was slated for demolition in the spring.</p><p>\u201cWell, Sean and I were just talking about that.\u201d She took hold of the younger girl\u2019s hand. \u201cYou know that you inherited like a million trillion dollars from Gerald, and with that you could build yourself a couple hundred new mansions\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Taire said flatly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so, either.\u201d She squeezed her hand. \u201cDoor number two is Samuel, your legal guardian thanks to all those papers we forged, who would love to have you come up and stay with him in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where you would be waited on hand-and-foot style and get to hang out at the country club and date very rich boys and dress way better than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Samuel a lot, but Martha\u2019s Vineyard?\u201d Taire looked doubtful.</p><p>\u201cWhich brings us to door number three. I really wanted you to live with me, but I also thought you might like to have your own place. I\u2019m moving in with Sean, so my apartment is going to be empty. What do you think about moving in across the hall from us at D\u2019Anges?\u201d</p><p>Her chin dropped. \u201cReally? You mean it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Of course, it\u2019s pretty small and basic, but we can redecorate and stuff. You\u2019d still have to share the bathroom with us,\u201d she tacked on.</p><p>Taire leveled a look at her. \u201cTrick, I haven\u2019t had any bathroom for like months now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but sometimes Sean hogs the hot water,\u201d Rowan warned. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a neat freak. Seriously. He folds the towels so much they\u2019re like origami. I have to keep drying my hands on a swooping crane.\u201d</p><p>Taire giggled. \u201cYou love him and you know it.\u201d</p><p>If only the kid knew. \u201cWe\u2019re working on it, but yeah. I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you and Jean-Marc?\u201d</p><p>Rowan had explained her romantic triangle with Sean and Jean-Marc to Taire, who had accepted the m\u00e9nage without a quibble. \u201cI\u2019ll also be spending some of my nights off over at Jean- Marc\u2019s place,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe, ah, wants to paint me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he wants to do a lot more than that,\u201d her sister said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cStop talking about the damn Frenchman,\u201d Sean said as he breezed in, and presented Taire with a Snickers bar. \u201cYour dessert, Sweet Pea.\u201d</p><p>Taire wrinkled her nose at Rowan. \u201cHe\u2019s going to call me that forever, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than Cupcake,\u201d Rowan grumbled.</p><p>They stayed with Taire until morning visiting hours were over. By that time she had fallen asleep, and Rowan used a tissue to wipe a betraying smudge of pizza sauce from her chin before tiptoeing out of the room with Sean.</p><p>\u201cSo who did she pick?\u201d Sean asked on the way down to the parking garage.</p><p>\u201cUs.\u201d She laughed as he picked her up and twirled her around. \u201cI told you she would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamuel is a tough act to follow.\u201d He kissed her. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m this happy.\u201d He frowned. \u201cShe\u2019s sixteen. We\u2019ve just inherited a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is a multimillionaire,\u201d Rowan reminded him, \u201cand who can tear down a building with the power of her thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel so good.\u201d He pressed her against him. \u201cI think I need to lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait \u2019til we get home,\u201d she said, patting his cheek. \u201cThen I\u2019ll tuck you in and rub your tummy.\u201d</p><p>Sean reached out and hit the stop button on the elevator. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you rub it now?\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
