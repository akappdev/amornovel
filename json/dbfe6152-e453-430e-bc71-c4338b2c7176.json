A pain grabbed in her arm. She looked down to find an IV attached to some long tubing running to a monitor. I'm in a hospital. Why? The last thing she remembered was... She drew a blank. Why couldn't she remember?</p><p>The door to the room opened, and a Japanese nurse stepped inside. \"Oh! You're awake.\"</p><p>\"Where am I?\" Shaundra asked trying to get her bearings.</p><p>\"In a hospital in Tokyo.\"</p> <p>Tokyo. Why am I in Tokyo? \"What am I doing here?\"</p><p>The nurse walked over to her and began taking her vitals.</p><p>\"Don't you remember?\"</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. \"No, not really. I seem to remember being in another hospital room a long time ago and then there was this loud noise and lots of water.\"</p><p>\"The earthquake,\" the nurse said loosening the blood pressure cuff on her arm.</p> <p>\"Earthquake? What earthquake?\"</p><p>\"There was an earthquake in the Miyagi Prefecture about four months ago. It happened while you were in another hospital there having a procedure done. There was also a tsunami, and thousands of people died.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked at the nurse. \"Did that hospital get destroyed?\"</p><p>The nurse nodded. \"Yes. An anesthesiologist saved your life. He got you out of the hospital and carried you to safety.\"</p><p>Some of it came back to her...the rising water, the panic in the hospital and in the streets. Shaundra shuddered remembering a man talking calmly to her as he carried her.</p><p>\"Did he survive?\"</p> <p>\"Yes, thankfully. He's now stationed at a hospital in Osaka.\"</p><p>\"So how did I get here?\" She knew she must have sounded like quite an idiot asking so many questions.</p><p>\"The two of you were rescued and flown here to Tokyo. He was released, and you've been here every since. \"</p><p>Damn, this is going to be one hell of a hospital bill. \"What's today's date?\"</p><p>\"June twenty-ninth,\" the nurse answered. \"Your vitals are fine and the doctor should be in any minute to talk to you.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\" Shaundra said.</p><p>The nurse left, and Shaundra continued to look around, noting the changes in her body. She was far from emaciated, which meant they had been feeding her intravenously from one of the many tubes attached to her.</p><p>The door opened again and a Japanese doctor entered.</p> <p>Hope he speaks English because I won't understand a word he says.</p><p>\"I'm so glad that you have finally awakened. My name is Doctor Obayashi.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded politely. \"Nice to meet you.\"</p><p>\"I can't believe it. You look so healthy. I can't believe you've been in a coma for months.\" He examined her thoroughly, and then he sat down in a chair across from her bed and began thumbing through her file. \"Your procedure went through smoothly. We were able to complete it once you were brought here. You are in excellent shape and can be released in a couple of days if you don't run a fever during the night.\"</p><p>\"Is it safe to say that there won't be any other problems?\"</p><p>Some things had come back to her now including the reason for the procedure.</p><p>\"Yes, you're past the danger point but you're going to need a lot of rest and relaxation for a couple of months. You've been through a very traumatic time.\" He chuckled. \"The male doctors and orderlies around here are going to very disappointed that you are leaving.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked at him oddly. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"You have become quite a celebrity around here. Most of them were on call when you were brought it. They have dubbed you their sleeping princess. They've taken turns staying with you and making sure you were undisturbed in slumber. They think it is a miracle that you have survived the earthquake.\"</p><p>\"So, there are no complications?\"</p><p>\"None as far as I can see. You'll need to stay off our feet as much as possible and follow a no-salt diet.\"</p><p>\"I understand, and I can go home tomorrow?\"</p><p>\"Yes, I don't see any reason why we should keep you. Do you need me to notify someone to come for you?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Funny, we couldn't find anything on you except your name when you were brought in. We've put ads in the newspaper and searched every data bank but nothing came up on an African American female by the name of Shaundra Yoshida.\"</p><p>Shaundra shrugged. It surprised her too since she was registered as being married to a Japanese citizen.</p><p>\"Do you need me to notify someone to come for you?\"</p><p>It was June, which meant Aomori's China tour was over. \"I don't really know anyone in Tokyo.\" She wondered if Harper Kehoe was in town. \"But I'll find someone.\" She supposed she could stay at his place in Tokyo for a couple of days.</p><p>The doctor left, and Shaundra reached for the phone on the bedside table and dialed Harper. He answered.</p><p>\"Hello, Harper Kehoe speaking.\"</p><p>\"Hello, Harper, this is Shaundra.\"</p><p>\"Oh, my God,\" he shouted. \"Where are you?\"</p><p>\"In a hospital in Tokyo.\"</p><p>\"Oh, thank God. I was so worried. I thought...\"</p><p>\"Yes, I know. Where are you?\"</p><p>\"In Tokyo.\"</p><p>\"I need a ride and a place to stay for a few days.\"</p><p>\"Sure what hospital are you at?\"</p><p>Shaundra looked around. \"Tokyo General Hospital. At least that is what is on the telephone. Do you have something to write with so you can copy down this number?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said. \"What is it?\"</p><p>Shaundra read the telephone number to him.</p><p>\"Are you sure you're all right?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" she said. \"As far as I can tell. Apparently I've been in a coma for three months and I just learned that I survived an earthquake and a tsunami.\"</p><p>\"Everyone has been so worried.\"</p><p>\"Ich?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"He's in bad shape. He left China to come back and search for you after you disappeared. Then he learned about the earthquake and the tsunami. He hasn't said too much, you know how he is.\"</p><p>Boy did she remember. \"I can't see him just yet,\" she said remembering why she had left him in the first place.</p><p>\"Listen, I'm coming over now.\"</p><p>\"Hurry\" Shaundra said, hoping it was visiting hours. \"I miss you.\"</p><p>\"I miss you too lovely lady. I'm on my way.\"</p><p>\"Don't tell anyone where you're going. Just come alone.\"</p><p>\"Is there anything that you need? Some clothes probably.</p><p>But that can wait until after I see you. I'll be there shortly darling.\" Harper hung up.</p><p>Shaundra hung up the phone. She wanted so desperately to call her husband Ichiro, to hear his voice and to tell him that she was okay.</p><p>Another nurse came in and removed the tubes from her.</p><p>\"You need to get out of that bed and see if you can use the toilet on your own.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. She pushed aside the covers and swung her legs over to the side of the bed.</p><p>\"Easy now.\" The nurse came around to help her.</p><p>Pain shot through her legs. \"Ouch, my legs hurt.\"</p><p>\"That's because you haven't used them in a while and you've gained some weight.\"</p><p>No, she had gained a lot of weight. What have they been feeding me? She made it to the bathroom. All her plumbing functioned. Good. Shaundra washed herself up and the nurse helped her into a clean gown, and then she helped her into a chair while one of the hospital orderlies came in the change the bed. The man looked at her, smiled, and then blushed.</p><p>Shit. Some things never changed.</p><p>\"I'm expecting a visitor,\" she told the nurse after the orderly left. \"My boss. He's on his way.\"</p><p>\"Then I better get you a comb. It has grown a lot since you've arrived.\" She left the room for a moment and came back with some personal toiletries and helped Shaundra tackle her hair. It had grown thick and long like it was when she was younger, and she wondered if Harper would recognize her since she'd changed so much.</p><p>A few minutes later a male dietician arrived. He too smiled at her sheepishly. \"This is healthy for you,\" he said in broken English. \"No salt.\"</p><p>Shaundra grimaced and then smiled at him. The man walked out of the room like he was floating on air. Crazy.</p><p>Maybe she should ask the doctor what was inside of her that made men act like that toward her.</p><p>Someone knocked at her door a few minutes after she finished eating and a well-dressed white man entered carrying a vase of flowers. He stopped when he saw her.</p><p>\"Shaundra, oh my God, it is you.\" He put the vase on the bedside table and went to her, hugging her tightly. He kissed her on the head and then released her. \"Let me look at you.\"</p><p>He stepped back and stared. \"You are so beautiful.\"</p><p>Shaundra sneered. \"I'm fat.\" Harper looked good. In fact, he always did.</p><p>\"No, the weight looks good on you. And look at all that hair. Satoshi will be all over you.\" Satoshi was the piano man in the Korean pop group, Aomori, and one of her husband Ichiro's closest friends.</p><p>Shaundra started to cry.</p><p>\"Oh, don't do that again. When did you develop hormones?\" He walked over and sat down in a chair across from her bed.</p><p>Shaundra smiled weakly, wiping her eyes. \"Apparently over the last four months since the last time I saw you. How is Satoshi?\"</p><p>\"As messed up if not more than Ichiro. You've really done a number on those guys.\"</p><p>The dietician came back into the room, looked over at Harper and then at her, and then smiled. He blushed and then left the room with her tray of dirty dishes.</p><p>Shaundra shook her head and Harper chuckled. \"I see its still happening.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"What about the others?\"</p><p>\"Yori and Amaya have moved out of the farmhouse into their own home.\"</p><p>\"Good. I'm glad that their lives have gone on.\" She paused. \"How did the tour turn out?\"</p><p>\"Much better than we expected. Kenshin stepped in for Ichiro after Ichiro returned back to Japan, and Mr. Niigata and I are about to open another company in China.\"</p><p>\"Good. I'm glad that everything has turned out well for everyone.\"</p><p>\"For some of us. When are you going to see your husband?\"</p><p>Shaundra shrugged. \"I guess I'll have to do it before the divorce.\"</p><p>Harper looked at her oddly. \"You're still plan to go through with that?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"More so now. He needs a young wife.</p><p>It was wrong from the beginning. He'll get over me.\"</p><p>\"And what about you?\" Harper asked. \"What are you plans?\"</p><p>\"I need somewhere to stay temporarily since I can't fly just yet and will be on bed rest for a couple of months, but then I plan to go back home to the United States.\"</p><p>\"Where do you want to go? I have a couple of places here in Tokyo as well as Osaka.\"</p><p>\"Not Osaka. I think I need to stay in Tokyo for a while to be close to my doctor, but afterward I going back to New York.\"</p><p>Harper took out his cell phone and dialed a number. \"This is Harper Kehoe. I need you to do something for me,\" he said to whoever he spoke to on the other line. \"I'm going to need...\" He read off a long list. \"And I need it ASAP.\" He hung up a few minutes later. \"Everything will be ready, including clothes.\"</p><p>\"But you don't know my size,\" Shaundra protested.</p><p>Harper smiled. \"Give me credit will you. Haven't I dressed you before?\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked remembering. \"No thongs. I don't think I can squeeze my butt into them.\"</p><p>He smiled at her wickedly. \"I bet you could. That behind is just a little a little bigger but still stellar.\"</p><p>\"Only you would think that.\"</p><p>\"I speak the truth. And you're going to love this condo. It has a sunken tub and a private beach and all the quiet you need to recuperate.\"</p><p>\"I'm going to be glad to get out of this hospital but the bed rest is going to suck. I feel the need to write.\"</p><p>\"You'll have a laptop, paper, and plenty of pens at your disposal.\"</p><p>\"And I'm on a salt-free diet.\"</p><p>Harper laughed. \"You've always been on a salt-free diet but you always manage to forget that.\"</p><p>\"Not this time,\" she assured him. \"I'll be good. I don't have any other choice. I've escaped death three times now, and I'm not going to test my luck.\"</p><p>Harper grew serious. \"Do you remember anything about the earthquake?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Shaundra replied. \"Not much.\"</p><p>\"How did you manage to escape?\"</p><p>\"A nurse told me that an anesthesiologist carried me out of the hospital. I need to find out who he is so I can thank him.</p><p>He's working in a hospital in Osaka.\"</p><p>\"I'll find him,\" Harper replied. \"But I think I need to tell you that Ichiro filed a missing person report on you a couple of months ago. That's how he knew that you were in Miyagi.\"</p><p>Shaundra grimaced. \"Does he know why I was there?\" She already knew an African American woman walking around Japan would draw some attention.</p><p>Harper shook his head. \"I don't think so. But you know it won't be long before he finds you.\"</p><p>\"I know,\" Shaundra said with a sigh. \"I just need a little more time to prepare. I'm in no position right now to fight with him if he won't sign the divorce papers.\"</p><p>\"I hope you reconsider.\"</p><p>Shaundra sighed again. \"I'll think about it. I just don't want to be a burden to anyone.\"</p><p>\"Do you want me to call your kids?\"</p><p>She bet her four kids and her mother were worried to death about her. \"I'll do it once I'm out of here. I don't want them flying all the way to Japan.\"</p><p>Harper rose and walked over to the bed and kissed her.</p><p>\"When are you going to stop worrying about others? They are your family.\"</p><p>Shaundra clung to him. If she hadn't been so rash, he might be her husband now. \"I'm so tired of fighting, Harper. I just want my normal life back.\"</p><p>He released her gently. \"You know things are going to change in a couple of days. You have to be prepared to talk to detectives, the news media, and all the people in your life who have been wondering if you were dead or alive these last few months.\"</p><p>\"I know. I'll end the drama soon. They won't find me for at least a couple of days.\"</p><p>\"I need to get out of here so you can rest. I'll find out from the nurse what time they're releasing you tomorrow and the name of that anesthesiologist. And I'll come back to get you.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" Shaundra said. \"I don't know what I would do without you.\"</p><p>\"You'd probably be the bride of some rich prince. Every man who has ever met you has fallen in love with you.\"</p><p>\"It must be the cologne,\" she joked.</p><p>\"But you don't wear cologne.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I know but cougars have their own special scent.\"</p><p>He kissed her on the forehead and left.</p><p>Shaundra reclined in the bed, reached for the remote, and turned on the television, needing to find out what was happening in the world since she'd been asleep.</p><p>Satoshi Hayashi pored over the reports from the detectives he'd hired to find Shaundra. Everything they had brought him so far was useless. All he knew was that she was spotted in Miyagi Prefecture months ago. Everything pointed to the fact that she could have been killed by the earthquake or the tsunami, but deep down inside he didn't feel that she was dead.</p><p>They have always had this special bond. He knew when Shaundra was tired or feeling frisky. He could sense her presence anywhere in the farmhouse when she was home, and he even knew something was wrong with her just before he and Takumijo Yamazaki had found her unconscious in her bedroom a couple a months ago after she and Ichiro had a terrible argument. She wasn't dead, but she wasn't where he could put his finger on her either.</p><p>\"What are you doing?\"</p><p>Satoshi look up to find his bandmate and fearless leader Yori Morika standing in the doorway watching him.</p><p>\"What are you doing here? Don't you have a home of your own now?\" Yori and his wife Amaya had moved out of the farmhouse after Aomori returned from China. He pushed the stack of papers aside.</p><p>Yori continued into the room and over to the desk. He picked up one of the reports and read it. \"Why are you torturing yourself?\" He handed Satoshi back the report.</p><p>\"Because I refuse to accept the fact that she's gone. Why are you so calm?\"</p><p>\"Because I have accepted the fact and made peace.\"</p><p>Satoshi sighed. \"I wish it was that easy for me. What the hell was she doing in Miyagi? How did she get there?\"</p><p>\"These things we may never know,\" Yori replied. \"We can't even be sure she was there. She is not the only African American female in Japan.\"</p><p>\"Even if that is so, even if a mistake has been made, then where is she? People just don't disappear.\"</p><p>Yori nodded. \"Yes, they do.\" He sat down at the table.</p><p>\"Every day.\"</p><p>\"Not Shaundra. I think she left on her own and for reasons unknown to us. Was she sick? Was she dying and didn't want us to know?\"</p><p>Yori shook his head. \"It is possible she left just because all of this had become too much for her. Or maybe some other man caught her fancy and she took off to be with him.\"</p><p>Satoshi frowned at him. \"Dude, that's mean, even for you.\"</p><p>Yori shrugged. \"But it could be true. Men gravitate to her like flies to a piece of meat. Maybe she found one younger than Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"I don't believe that. She loved him.\"</p><p>\"She loved me too, but she left me for Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"When are you going to get over that? You were the one less than honest about your feelings for her. And I was stupid too. I should have spoken up. Then I wouldn't be sitting here going insane with worry.\"</p><p>\"Okay, let's say for argument sake that she's still alive.</p><p>How did she manage to leave? Harper couldn't find any proof that she left Japan by plane or boat, so that only means that she left Osaka in a car. Who did she know in Osaka who could have arranged for her to leave here?\"</p><p>\"The only person I can think of is Harper, but didn't he hire an investigator to search for her too?\"</p><p>\"So he says,\" Yori replied. \"What if he was lying? He was the last person to see her. What if he did something to her or helped her leave?\"</p><p>Satoshi thought about it. \"You're right. \"He loves her just as much as we do, and he'd do anything for her. The bastard.\"</p><p>\"So I think you need to start there. If he made any kind of preparations for her, there will surely be a paper trail.\"</p><p>Satoshi agreed. \"I hope you're right. I'd rather know she's with him than dead.\"</p><p>\"Where's Tak?\" Yori asked, suddenly changing the subject.</p><p>He did that often when things got too hurtful to him. He could say what he wanted; he missed the hell out of Shaundra. \"He went out.\"</p><p>\"Clubbing?\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"You know him. He can't stand sitting around idle.\"</p><p>\"We need to think about recording a new CD. The China tour was great but we need to make some new plans.\"</p><p>Satoshi agreed. He'd been working on some new tunes in- between worrying and training Kenshin, who decided he now liked being an idol.</p><p>\"What about Ichiro?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"I think he's in his room. He doesn't come out much unless he's going out to check on the restaurant.\" Ichiro owned a restaurant in Tokyo, one in Osaka, and had just started building on one in Kyoto.</p><p>\"I wish he would get some professional help,\" Yori said.</p><p>\"He can't go on like this. He's closed himself off more now than ever.\"</p><p>\"He's lost his wife,\" Satoshi reminded him. \"The only true love he's ever had. He needs time to deal.\"</p><p>\"No, it's more than that,\" Yori said. \"It's like he's given up on life.\"</p><p>\"She was his life, no matter what you or I think. The sun and the moon revolved around Shaundra. They were even considering adopting a baby.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"He told me that they were thinking about adopting a baby. Takumijo gave him the idea.\"</p><p>\"And Shaundra agreed to this?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"Shaundra liked her freedom. She didn't want to be tied down,\" Yori said.</p><p>\"You seem to know an awful lot about her,\" Satoshi said looking at him curiously.</p><p>Yori sighed. \"Regardless of what you think, I loved her. We could talk about things I could never talk about with Amaya.\"</p><p>\"Then why did you back away?\"</p><p>\"I don't know. I guess I got scared, plus I was already engaged to Amaya. It would have messed up so many lives.\"</p><p>\"You are a fool,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>\"Yes, I know, but I'm rational. She was Ich's wife. In the end, she made the decision.\"</p><p>Satoshi picked up the telephone.</p><p>\"Who are you calling?\"</p><p>\"My investigator.\" The phone rang and a man answered.</p><p>\"Hello, this is Satoshi Hayashi. I need you to look into something for me.\"</p><p>\"Yes, Mr. Hayashi,\" the man said.</p><p>\"Find out everything you can on a Harper Kehoe. I need to know about any activity on his credit cards back to the end of February until now here in Asia and get back to me.\"</p><p>\"Yes, Mr. Hayashi.\"</p><p>Satoshi hung up. \"If Harper has any secrets, this investigator will find them. Having an ambassador for a father does have its advantages,\" Satoshi said to Yori.</p><p>Yori smirked. \"Remind me never to piss you off.\" He rose and headed toward the door. \"What happens if you find out that she's alive and he's been hiding her all this time?\"</p><p>Satoshi smirked menacing. \"I don't know, but I will assure you that revenge will be sweet.\"</p><p>\"I better check on Ich.\" Yori said. \"I know he'll just love seeing me.\"</p><p>Yori knocked on the door.</p><p>\"Yes,\" a voice said from the other side.</p><p>A yes was just as good as a come in. Yori turned the knob and entered Ichiro's room. The bedroom was immaculate, the bed made, floors and furniture were polished, and there was no sign of Ichiro which meant he was in Shaundra's office. He passed through the bedroom and entered the adjoining room.</p><p>He found his beautiful maknae seated at his wife's desk with a cup of sake in one hand and the bottle in front of him on the desk. He looked up when he sensed Yori's presence.</p><p>\"What are you doing here?\"</p><p>Yori smirked. Some things never changed. \"I've come to check on you. Satoshi said he hasn't seen you in a while.\"</p><p>Ichiro raised the cup to his mouth and sipped the rice liquor and then lowered the cup. \"I've been around,\" he replied.</p><p>His appearance was appalling. Ichiro's hair wasn't combed, his clothes were disheveled, and he looked like he hadn't shaved in weeks.</p><p>\"Why don't you come down and visit with me and Satoshi.</p><p>We're brainstorming ideas for our next CD.\"</p><p>\"I'm not in the mood,\" Ichiro said. \"I'd be more of a hindrance than a help.\"</p><p>Yori sighed. It was the liquor speaking. \"You can't just close yourself up in this room. You need to be around others who care about you.\"</p><p>Ichiro raised his eyes. The blue pupils looked dim and lifeless. \"You mean you?\"</p><p>\"Regardless of what we've been through in the past we are still family.\"</p><p>Ichiro just sighed and took another sip of his drink. \"Sure we are. Let me put it this way. I can't concentrate on writing songs any more. All my energy is taken up trying to find...\"</p><p>He paused.</p><p>\"I understand,\" Yori said. \"But if you change your mind please come down.\"</p><p>\"I won't,\" Ichiro said dismissing him.</p><p>Yori turned to leave but halted. \"If it means anything to you, I miss her too. But not the way you do. She was my friend and my world is a little better because she was in it.\"</p><p>He stepped out of the office, walked back through the bedroom, and stepped out into the hallway. He heard the porcelain cup shatter against a wall as he closed the door.</p><p>Yori sighed. An intervention was definitely in order whether Ichiro agreed or not.</p><p>Satoshi waited for him in the foyer. \"How is he?\"</p><p>\"Not at his best,\" Yori replied. \"He's sitting in Shaundra's office drinking sake.\"</p><p>\"Drunk?\"</p><p>\"Pretty much so and in need of grooming. I don't think I've ever seen him so bad. He cared about his appearance ever since he reached puberty. He hasn't even combed his hair.\"</p><p>Satoshi looked startled. \"But it gets tangled if he doesn't comb and brush it.\"</p><p>\"And he looks as though he's slept in his clothes.\"</p><p>\"Baby has hit rock bottom,\" Satoshi said with a sigh.</p><p>Yori nodded. \"We have to do something...get him out of the house.\"</p><p>\"Clubbing?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"Maybe. He needs to get out and get some fresh air. He needs to get his wife out of his head for a couple of hours.\"</p><p>Satoshi agreed. \"I'll speak with him tomorrow, and I'll throw him in the shower and dress him if I have too.\"</p><p>\"And comb his hair,\" Yori ordered.</p><p>\"It will be my pleasure.\"</p><p>Yori shook his head. \"I know it will be.\"</p><p>Satoshi ignored his comment. \"I'll get Tak and Kenny to go out with us. We haven't all been out since...\"</p><p>\"Don't remind me,\" Yori said. \"No women this time. Just us guys like we used to.\"</p><p>\"I hope I can get Takumijo to go. He's been busy making that drama since Osamu moved back here.\"</p><p>Osamu Nakaumura was Takumijo's best friend, a famous Japanese actor and he had been trying for years to get Takumijo to give up singing and make a feature-length movie. So far Takumijo hadn't agreed to anything but to join him occasionally in a drama.</p><p>\"Maybe we should invite him too.\"</p><p>Satoshi frowned. \"You can't be serious.\"</p><p>\"I most certainly am. We've gone clubbing with Yi-jun before and he's your best friend. I fail to see the difference.\"</p><p>\"Oh, there's a big difference,\" Satoshi said in the defense of his childhood friend who at the moment was in the United States filming a movie. They're publicist, Cristal Gentry, was there with him for moral support. \"Okay, invite him too. This isn't about Osamu. It's about Ichiro.\" He paused. \"You think we need to tell Ich about Harper?\"</p><p>Yori shook his head. \"Not just yet. Let's not build up his hopes. We'll tell him when we get some credible evidence.\"</p><p>Yori headed to the front door.</p><p>\"Where are you going?\"</p><p>\"Home to my wife,\" he said. \"I told her I was just coming over here to check on you guys. She's cooking dinner.\"</p><p>Satoshi grimaced. \"She can cook?\"</p><p>Yori shrugged. \"Surprised me too. She also keeps house and washes windows.\"</p><p>\"Amaya?\"</p><p>Yori nodded. \"She tries her best to make me happy.\"</p><p>\"I'm glad,\" Satoshi said. \"At least one of us is content.\"</p><p>\"Now if I can only get her to cut those apron strings with her parents my life would be complete.\" He left the house.</p><p>Satoshi's phone rang just as he headed toward the den.</p><p>\"Hello.\"</p><p>\"Hello, Mr. Hayashi. This is Tanaka.\"</p><p>\"Yes, Mr. Tanaka.\" It was one of the investigators he hired.</p><p>\"I think I might have found something.\"</p><p>Satoshi hurried into the den closing the door behind him.</p><p>\"What is it?\"</p><p>\"I think she's alive,\" the investigator said.</p><p>Satoshi's heart flipped in his chest. \"What?\"</p><p>\"She was in a hospital during the time of the earthquake and tsunami but she was saved by an anesthesiologist and then taken to Tokyo. Her trail ends there momentarily but get this, the anesthesiologist is working in Osaka.\"</p><p>\"Where?\" Satoshi asked excitedly. He reached for a pen and pad on the desk.</p><p>\"Osaka General Hospital. His name is Keiichi Wantanabe.\"</p><p>Satoshi copied the information down. The Osaka General Hospital is the place Shaundra was hospitalized months ago.</p><p>\"And you said this guy saved her?\"</p><p>\"Yes. My contacts tell me that he literally shielded her on the operating table with his own body and then unhooked her and carried her out of the place to somewhere safe as the wave came in. He stayed with her and cared for her until they were both rescued. That's all I've been able to uncover at the moment.\"</p><p>It was more than he expected in such a short period of time. \"Thank you,\" Satoshi told him. \"Please keep up the good work.\" They disconnected the phone call and Satoshi looked down at the sheet of paper. Shaundra had surgery?</p><p>And some man risked his life to save her? And he is now working just minutes away. Satoshi looked at his watch. It was late. He wondered if this Keiichi Wantanabe was on call.</p><p>He picked up the phone again and got the operator to find a number for the hospital. She connected him. \"Hello, my name is Satoshi Hayashi. Is this the anesthesia section?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" someone on the other line said.</p><p>\"I'm trying to find a Keiichi Wantanabe.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry; he's not on call tonight.\"</p><p>He heard some papers rustling.</p><p>\"He's due in for surgery tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"Does he have any off time? I'm a friend of his and I just got to town and I wanted to surprise him.\"</p><p>\"He has a couple of surgeries scheduled tomorrow but he usually breaks for lunch around noon. We're located on the third floor.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\" Satoshi said and hung up. He leaned back in the chair. Tomorrow's lunch should be interesting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harper opened the door to the condo, entered, and turned on the light. The fluorescent lighting lit up the room. \"Come on in, darling.\"</p><p>Shaundra hesitated momentarily, nodded, and then slowly entered the condo. Harper had offered to carry her once they left the hospital but she declined. She had to start using her legs sooner or later. She blinked. The walls were awash in brilliant white and the contemporary furniture was black.</p><p>\"I just had the place refurnished,\" Harper announced as he shut the door and carried her small piece of luggage in.</p><p>\"There's two bedrooms, two baths, a kitchen, and a little study.\"</p> <p>\"It's very beautiful,\" Shaundra said walking over to the window and looking out at the seaside not too far away. It reminded her of that day in Kyoto when she and Ichiro went to see a piece of property where he wanted to open his seafood restaurant.</p><p>\"The bedroom is this way,\" Harper said to her.</p><p>Shaundra turned to face him. \"Fresh guy.\"</p><p>Harper chuckled. \"That was the furthest thing from my mind. I thought you might like to rest.\"</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. \"Rest is all I've been doing for months.\"</p> <p>\"But the doctor said...\"</p><p>\"And I fully intend to follow his instructions to the letter but right now I'd just like to sit down and talk with an old friend.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" Harper said. \"Let me put your things away.\" He walked into one of the bedrooms and reappeared several minutes later. \"Are you hungry?\"</p><p>\"A little,\" she said. \"But I can fix something later.\"</p><p>\"Nonsense,\" he said. \"It's already prepared. All I have to do is heat it.\"</p><p>Shaundra followed him into the small kitchen and eyed the plates of food by the microwave. \"Did you do all of this?\"</p> <p>\"I wish I could take the credit for it but I had a friend prepare it.\" He removed the cover. \"All salt-free.\"</p><p>\"It looks delicious. His friend had prepared traditional Japanese cuisine...rice, soup and lots of vegetables.</p><p>Harper heated the food and sent her to the little black- and-white dinette set to sit down. Moments later the two of them sat across from each other catching up on the last few months.</p><p>\"Of course everyone at both publishing companies is very worried. I heard that poor Jackson cries every time your name is mentioned.\"</p><p>Dear Jackson. \"Has he found a permanent boyfriend yet?\"</p><p>\"He hadn't the last time I spoke to him. You know he likes variety.\"</p><p>Did she ever. No adorable gay man was safe around him.</p><p>\"And poor Dorothy is inconsolable. She's offered to fly back here and help look for you.\"</p> <p>\"I'll make sure she's one of the first people I call.\"</p><p>\"And that will be?\" Harper asked. He stopped eating.</p><p>\"Soon,\" Shaundra said, noncommittal. What was the rush?</p><p>She'd been missing four months already. What was one more week?</p><p>\"The refrigerator is stocked with enough food for a week,\"</p><p>he told her. \"You do remember how to cook, don't you?\"</p><p>\"Don't think I've gone stupid just because I married a chef.</p><p>I can still manage to feed myself.\"</p><p>\"You won't find any salt in the place. I made sure of that,\"</p><p>Harper told her.</p><p>\"Thank you. One temptation in the kitchen is enough.\"</p><p>\"If I thought you were serious, I'd have my lawyers drawing up your divorce papers for you.\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked. \"How is the family?\"</p><p>\"They're okay,\" Harper said. \"My ex-wife has stopped trying to get me to raise her alimony payments. Kevin is doing well in his first year in college, and Damien, well he's raising all kinds of hell, going out drinking with his friends, skipping classes like an education at that prestigious New York college is free, and he's dating some girl.\"</p><p>\"Look at it this way, he could be dating some guy.\"</p><p>\"True,\" Harper said. \"I don't know what I am going to do with him. I've got a good mind to bring him over here and put him to work at the publishing company.\"</p><p>\"How old is he now?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"Twenty-three.\"</p><p>\"Maybe you should. He's about to graduate anyway. He should learn the business from the bottom up. I'd keep an eye on him if you decide to.\"</p><p>Harper chuckled. \"No thank you. I want you as a woman, not as a daughter-in-law.\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked at the reference to her liking younger men. \"Aw come on, I won't hurt him. I'd just baby him a bit.\"</p><p>Harper grew silent.</p><p>\"I was only teasing.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I know. It's just that...\"</p><p>\"It happened and there's nothing I can do about it,\" she told him.</p><p>\"Yes, I know. If we had known earlier, maybe we could have done something.\"</p><p>\"I don't play with the Lord,\" Shaundra said. \"My mother once told me that he doesn't put anything on your shoulders you can't bear. And it's not the end of the world. It is just an adjustment.\"</p><p>\"You're right,\" he said picking up his glass of wine. \"Here's to starting over and new adventures.\"</p><p>Shaundra picked up her glass of milk. \"And new partnerships.\"</p><p>Satoshi left the farmhouse without telling anyone his destination. He also drove his own car, a nifty red two-seater he'd purchase about a year ago. It had been sitting in the garage collecting dust because Kenshin almost always drove then wherever they had to go. He decided not to let the top down even though it was early July and the temperature was warm. He didn't want to mess his hair or sweat out his suit.</p><p>He had camouflaged himself the best he could in dark shades and a hat. The last thing he needed was to be recognized by the fangirls. He wanted to appear to be a businessman, and he even had a briefcase.</p><p>The traffic was excessive as usual but not quite as bad as Beijing but coming in a close second. He finally spotted the hospital and drove in its direction. Satoshi parked the car a safe distance away from other cars and out of the path of ambulances. He got out and walked into the hospital. He remembered where the elevator was located, took it to the third floor, and then walked over to the nurse's station once the door opened.</p><p>The young woman behind the desk did a double take when he approached, like she recognized him but wasn't sure.</p><p>Maybe he should had have tried wearing a wig or changing his hair color. He bowed. \"Good afternoon. I'm looking for Keiichi Wantanabe.\"</p><p>\"He just went down to the cafeteria,\" the nurse said.</p><p>\"Aren't you...?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Satoshi said putting his finger to his lips. \"I am here on business and would appreciate a little privacy.\"</p><p>\"I understand,\" she said rewarding him with a big smile.</p><p>\"You're very pretty,\" he told her.</p><p>The woman blushed.</p><p>\"I'm supposed to meet Mr. Wantanabe. Can you tell me what he looks like?\"</p><p>The nurse described him.</p><p>Easy to find, Satoshi thought. \"And the location of the cafeteria?\"</p><p>\"Second floor, to the right of the elevators.\"</p><p>Satoshi bowed again. \"It was nice meeting you Miss Yang,\"</p><p>he said reading her nametag.</p><p>The young woman blushed again.</p><p>Satoshi hurried away. Business before pleasure. He sighed.</p><p>I wonder if she's single. He boarded the elevator again and rode down to the second floor and followed his nose to the cafeteria. He spotted Keiichi Wantanabe in the crowded eatery. Satoshi grabbed a tray and went through the food line, paid for his meal, and then walked over to Wantanabe's table. \"Do you mind if I join you Mr. Wantanabe.\"</p><p>The man looked up. \"Please be seated. Are you a doctor?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Satoshi said. \"A piano player.\"</p><p>\"Then how do you know me?\"</p><p>\"I think you saved the life of a friend of mine during the earthquake. An African American female about fifty years old.\"</p><p>Keiichi nodded. \"Mrs. Yoshida.\"</p><p>Was it his imagination or did the man smile and his eyes twinkle? Shit another one. \"Yes, Mrs. Yoshida. Her family has been quite worried. We thought she died.\"</p><p>\"She would have,\" Keiichi replied. \"Lucky for her I was there. I had to carry her out.\"</p><p>Satoshi checked him out. Keiichi was tall, muscular, about forty or fifty years old, with short, thick black hair and dark brown eyes. \"When was the last time you saw her?\"</p><p>\"About four months ago,\" Keiichi replied. \"We were flown to Tokyo after we were rescued. She was unconscious but otherwise in pretty good shape. I made sure of it. She was just too pretty and all the way in Miyagi with no family. Poor thing could not even speak Japanese.\"</p><p>Yup. He'd met Shaundra. \"And could you tell me if she's still in Tokyo. Her family is trying to find her.\"</p><p>He nodded. \"I checked on her from time to time.</p><p>Unfortunately she is still in a coma?\"</p><p>\"A coma?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"What hospital is she at?\"</p><p>\"Tokyo General,\" Keiichi said. \"Are you her husband?\"</p><p>\"No, her brother-in-law.\" Satoshi rose. \"Thank you for saving Shaundra's life. She means the world to us.\"</p><p>\"She's a very special lady,\" Keiichi said. \"I just wish she would wake up.\"</p><p>\"Do you happen to know why she's in a coma?\"</p><p>\"It was from the tsunami. She saw some pretty terrible stuff. The doctor said her body just shut down from the stress.\"</p><p>Oh, no not again. At this rate they were surely going to lose her. \"Can you tell me what kind of procedure she was having in Miyagi?\"</p><p>\"I'm afraid I can't. Doctor-patient confidentiality. But I kind of figure she didn't want anyone to know since she showed up at the hospital alone.\"</p><p>\"I understand,\" Satoshi said. What could have been so bad that she couldn't even tell Ich? \"We just need to find her. Her kids are very worried.\"</p><p>\"She has kids?\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"Four.\"</p><p>\"I didn't know that.\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"Please accept my thanks again for rescuing her. I shall be forever grateful.\" He bowed.</p><p>\"Are you going to Tokyo to see her?\" Keiichi asked.</p><p>Satoshi nodded.</p><p>\"Please tell her hello for me when she awakens.\"</p><p>\"I'll do more than that. I'll bring her to see you. I'm sure she'd like to thank you personally.\" He walked away from the table, emptied his trash, and left the cafeteria. He took the elevator down to the lobby and walked to his car. Once inside he pulled out his cell phone and dialed Yori.</p><p>\"Hello.\"</p><p>\"It's me, Satoshi. What are you doing?\"</p><p>\"Watching television. Why?\"</p><p>\"How would you like to go on a little road trip tomorrow?\"</p><p>\"Where to?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"Tokyo.\"</p><p>\"Sure, what time?\"</p><p>\"Around eight.\" He paused. \"Aren't you going to ask why?\"</p><p>\"No. You wouldn't be asking unless it is important.\"</p><p>\"Oh, it is. Let's just say things are going to get interesting.\"</p><p>Ichiro stepped out of the shower with his hair plastered to his face, shoulders and back. What use to be his pride and joy now irritated the hell of him? He scooped his hair up and wrapped a towel around it while drying off his body with a second towel. Afterward he walked over to the mirror. The week's growth of hair on his face made him look older and his eyes appeared duller. Satoshi was right. He needed to get his ass in gear. If Shaundra were, still alive she would have found some way to contact him or her family by now.</p><p>He reached for his razor and shaving cream and removed the hair from most of his face leaving a little mustache and peach fuzz on his chin. He didn't even need to shave last year, now he was growing it like a wolf. He went back to his work on his hair, toweling it dry, adding leave-in conditioner, and then blowing it dry with a diffuser. Then he went through the long slow process of braiding it into a plat.</p><p>Why'd he agree to go clubbing with them he didn't know, but he guessed it was better than sitting in the house where everything in his bedroom reminded him of her. He even sunk so low as to read one of her novels for KiNii, and unfortunately it hadn't grossed him out reading about two men coupling. Shaundra had made it sound so innocent, capturing more of the love story and focusing on the romance. The actual sex act was treated with finesse, graphic but not sleazy. He sighed. He really fucked up with her, didn't try to understand her spontaneity about her life and blamed her for the males in their lives reaction to her. Instead of blaming her, he should have accepted the fact that she hadn't done anything to disrespect him. And it had been just a dance with Yori. If she wanted Yori in her bed, she'd had plenty of opportunities to do so, which she didn't.</p><p>A few minutes later he was dressed in a crisp new charcoal gray linen suit he purchased while in Beijing and a black shirt with a gray stripe down the center. He picked up his slip-on leather shoes and his wallet and left his bedroom. He met up with Satoshi and Takumijo in the foyer.</p><p>Satoshi had decided on a more conservative look, a brown business suit, a tan shirt and a brown tie. Takumijo, always frocked in the current club gear had decided on a two-pieced denim outfit with a scoop-neck white pullover shirt. Silver chain, rings and bracelets accented his outfit.</p><p>A car horn sounded outside.</p><p>\"That must be Kenny,\" Takumijo said. \"Yori is meeting us at the club.\"</p><p>Ichiro nodded. It felt strange not having their lead singer or any of the women accompany them.</p><p>They climbed into the town car instead of the limousine since it was just going to be four of them. Kenshin was dressed in a navy blue suit with a light blue shirt, minus a tie.</p><p>All of them donned dark glasses but didn't really care if they were recognized or not. They had even left the bodyguards at home. No one planned to get into trouble...they never did.</p><p>They were just going out to enjoy some good music and do some drinking and dancing.</p><p>Less than fifteen minutes later they drove into a parking lot of a new club that had just opened a couple of months ago. It featured a disc jockey like their usual hangout but the patrons had to be at least twenty-one to enter, which kept out the trouble-making youngsters.</p><p>\"This place is nice,\" Takumijo said, already dancing as he entered. The person at the door stamped their hands, ushered them in, and wished them a pleasant stay.</p><p>\"I see a table big enough for us,\" Kenshin said moving to the front and leading the way. It was far enough away from the crowd.</p><p>A waitress arrived for their drink order and they all agreed on beer. The evening was just starting and they didn't want to get too drunk so early. Kenshin ordered a non-alcoholic beer since he was the designated driver.</p><p>Yori arrived shortly afterward in a yellow double-breasted suit that only he could pull off. Ichiro noticed that he had put on a bit of weight, which looked good on him, and his hair had been died a dark brown and was cut shorter at the back.</p><p>Women gravitated to him the moment he stepped inside and he didn't exactly make it to the table before one pulled him to the dance floor.</p><p>\"There's Osamu,\" Takumijo said and pointed. He waved to get his friend's attention.</p><p>Ichiro frowned, wondering who'd invited him, but he decided to act cordial since he was Takumijo's friend. Osamu was a couple of years older than them, tall and lean with short brown hair. He sauntered over toward the table dressed elegantly in a black tieless suit with a red scooped-neck shirt similar to the one Takumijo wore. Around his neck hung a silver chain with one side of the heart missing and one matching earring in his right ear. He bowed respectfully when he reached the table, shaking everyone's hand. Yori joined them after the song ended. The waitress returned, and they sent her off for more beer.</p><p>The place started jumping about an hour later when droves of young Japanese women flocked into the club donned in sexy outfits and dangerously high-heeled shoes.</p><p>One of them, a bleached blonde with green contacts in her eyes brazenly walked over to the table and asked him to dance. Ichiro didn't want to at first but decided to give it a go.</p><p>A raven-haired beauty pulled Takumijo to the dance floor, and before long the others joined them, leaving Kenshin to guard their drinks. Kenny didn't mind since he was in a relationship and didn't feel right about dancing with anyone except his current girlfriend.</p><p>The young woman Ichiro danced with was cute. With heels she came up just to his chest, and she really could dance.</p><p>Another young woman, a striking brunette, latched on to him next for a slow dance. Ichiro panicked. He didn't really like to be touched by others. He took a couple of deep breaths and relaxed. Yori had no such qualms. Ichiro spotted Yori near a corner of the room slow dancing with some girl, while Satoshi danced with one in the center of the room.</p><p>Takumijo and Osamu had returned to the table together, giving Kenshin some time to use the toilet.</p><p>The young woman smelled nice and her hair looked bouncy, Ichiro noted as he took her into his arms. His body responded instantly on contact with hers. Guilt bit at his heart and the pit of his stomach for a moment but he refused to succumb to it. Shaundra had left him. Was he supposed to just lie down and die?</p><p>A couple of young women came over to the table to join them during the DJ's intermission. The brunette cozied up to him, rewarding him with a smile and trying to engage him in conversation. Ichiro was a little rusty in that department but managed a few intelligent sentences under the scrutiny of the others, who'd been watching him like a hawk from the moment they entered the club.</p><p>The DJ returned and Ichiro excused himself to use the men's room. A few minutes later Satoshi followed him in.</p><p>\"Enjoying yourself?\" Satoshi asked standing next to him using another urinal.</p><p>\"I've pissed before,\" Ichiro replied.</p><p>\"You know what I mean.\"</p><p>At least Satoshi had the decency this time not to check out his package. \"She's okay,\" Ichiro replied knowing full well what the fellows were trying to do. \"But I won't be taking her home tonight.\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"No, I didn't expect you to. I didn't invite you out for you to pick up on some strange chick, just to get you out of the farmhouse for a change of scenery.\" He finish, zipped, and joined Ichiro over by the sinks washed and dried his hands. Ichiro used some of the free lotion on his hands and then the two of them left the men's room. The brunette was still at the table and staring at both of them when they returned.</p><p>Another slow song came on and she jumped out of her sat and pulled Ichiro with her to the dance floor. Ichiro moved her around the floor to JYJ's \"Still in Love,\" and before long Ichiro knew he had made a big mistake by joining them tonight as Yoochun's words about still loving the woman he'd lost rang true in his head. After the music ended he excused himself and walked out of the club hoping the young woman would latch onto someone else, because it was too soon for him to start anything new.</p><p>Both Takumijo and Osmau were both noticeably missing from the table when Ichiro reentered the club a few minutes later. Ichiro spotted them at the bar tossing back gelatin shots. They'd probably have to carry Takumijo's crazy ass home tonight if he kept that up. The brunette had latched on to another guy but kept looking over his way. Ichiro averted his glance.</p><p>Yori chuckled. \"What's wrong? She's not pretty enough?\"</p><p>\"She's okay,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>\"Then why are you trying to avoid her? There's nothing wrong with sampling.\"</p><p>Before Ichiro had a chance to answer the DJ put on Silk's \"Freak Me Baby\" and the brunette headed straight for him.</p><p>Yori got out of his seat. \"Don't forget that you owe me one,\" he told Ichiro. Yori intercepted the brunette before she made it to the table.</p><p>\"This is interesting,\" Satoshi said taking his attention off the pretty Japanese girl at his side.</p><p>\"Hopefully the outcome will be different this time,\" Kenshin said.</p><p>Ichiro's gaze locked on the couple. The young woman clung to Yori as they danced slow Japanese style. He noted that it was not quite like how he danced with Shaundra to that song, but just as effective. Yori had some pretty serious moves and the young woman couldn't do anything but follow.</p><p>The song ended and the young woman hurried back over to her friends happy and squealing.</p><p>Yori walked back over to the table. \"See, Ich, just a dance, no more, no less.\"</p><p>Ichiro picked up his beer realizing that Yori was right. He had overreacted.</p><p>\"Where's Tak?\" Yori asked.</p><p>Satoshi pointed toward the bar. All of them looked over.</p><p>Osamu was toying with the chain around Takumijo's neck.</p><p>\"My guess is that Takumijo won't be coming home with us.\"</p><p>Some other guys joined Takumijo and Osamu at the bar.</p><p>Ichiro doubted it too. He'd probably go bar hopping with them and he'd camp out with Osamu until the sun came out.</p><p>And then he would sleep most of the day away. Ichiro frowned, hating the situation. Takumijo's personality changed whenever that man came to town. One day that association was going to get him in some serious hot water.</p><p>Things began to cool and slow down around midnight. The fellows had gotten rid of their female attachments, and Kenshin had received a phone call from his girlfriend to pick her up. Takumijo, as all of they expected, had left with Osamu and some of the guys at the bar.</p><p>\"Let's get the hell out of here,\" Satoshi said. \"Clubbing, I've discovered, now leaves a lot to be desired.\"</p><p>Ichiro already knew this but didn't comment. The only thing that had been accomplished was it got him out of the house but left him more depressed than ever.</p><p>\"Where the hell are we going?\" Takumijo asked half reclined and half seated in the back of the Expedition.</p><p>\"Tokyo,\" Yori said as he wheeled the SUV with perfection.</p><p>\"The freaking sun isn't up yet,\" Takumijo complained.</p><p>Yori ignored him. \"Nobody told you to go barhopping with your friends.\"</p><p>Takumijo groaned. \"Never drink tequila on an empty stomach.\"</p><p>\"If you throw up in here, I'm going to dump your ass on the side of the road,\" Yori warned. \"I just got this thing washed and detailed.\"</p><p>\"Where's Ichiro?\" Takumijo said suddenly realizing that Yori wasn't kidding.</p><p>\"At his restaurant. He went in early to give Daichi a hand,\"</p><p>Satoshi answered. \"There's a convention for doctors in town and they're expecting a crowd of them to come to the restaurant for lunch.\"</p><p>Which worked out perfectly for them, Yori reasoned. Why get him involved?</p><p>\"I think I'll take a nap,\" Takumijo said. \"Wake me when we get there.\"</p><p>Another good plan. He and Satoshi could talk without Takumijo's groaning and moaning recovery. Let him sleep it off. He was more effective sober.</p><p>Amaya luckily had gone into work with her parents and wouldn't be home for another day or so. And Kenshin had to drive their manager Masaaki into the office and had already been briefed to lie to Masaaki if he asked any questions about their whereabouts.</p><p>Satoshi's cell phone rang. He pulled it out of his pocket.</p><p>\"Hello.\" Satoshi turned on the speaker.</p><p>\"Hello troublemaker.\"</p><p>\"Hello Ms. Gentry,\" he said nonchalantly. \"How is California?\"</p><p>\"Too busy,\" Cristal replied. \"And full of pretentious people.\"</p><p>Satoshi laughed. \"But it's a great place to be if you want to be an actor. How's Yi-jun?\"</p><p>\"I guess he's okay. I haven't seen him in a couple of days.</p><p>He's been busy on the set so we haven't had much time to see each other.\"</p><p>\"Has he met the folks yet?\"</p><p>\"Yes. Mom thinks he's great and dad liked him too.\"</p><p>\"That's nice,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"What are you doofuses doing?\"</p><p>Yori looked over him and smirked.</p><p>\"We're out joyriding,\" Satoshi answered.</p><p>\"So early in the morning? Does Masaaki know you're out?\"</p><p>\"Sure,\" Satoshi lied.</p><p>\"How come I don't believe you?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>Yori chuckled. \"That's our Cristal. We missed you last night at the club.\"</p><p>\"You guys went clubbing? Who went to jail?\"</p><p>Both Yori and Satoshi laughed.</p><p>\"No one this time,\" Satoshi answered.</p><p>Yori could tell that Satoshi had mixed feelings about the call. Things were left unsettled when Cristal announced that she was going to the United States. Of course Satoshi had other things on his mind at the time.</p><p>\"We just needed to get Ichiro out of the house for a breather,\" Satoshi continued.</p><p>\"How is he?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"Depressed.\"</p><p>\"Have you guys had any word?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Satoshi answered quickly. \"Nothing yet.\"</p><p>Yori looked over at him and Satoshi shook his head.</p><p>\"When are you due back?\"</p><p>\"Next Saturday,\" Cristal answered.</p><p>\"Give me a call when you get in,\" Satoshi told her. \"I'll meet you at the airport.\"</p><p>\"Okay, I'll talk to you later.\" Cristal hung up.</p><p>\"That has got to be the shortest conversation ever between you two,\" Yori said.</p><p>Satoshi swept his bangs aside with his fingers. \"The less I say to her the better.\"</p><p>\"I'm not even going to ask you to explain.\"</p><p>\"She chose Yi-jun,\" Satoshi replied. \"No other explanation necessary.\"</p><p>Yori shook his head. Satoshi wouldn't know a good woman if she kicked him in the teeth.</p><p>Tokyo Metropolis came into view as Yori drove over the Rainbow Bridge...a suspension bridge that ran across Tokyo Bay between Shibaura Pier and the Odaiba waterfront. He looked down to check the navigation system. The hospital was located about three point five miles from the foot of the bridge.</p><p>Takumijo continued to snore peacefully in the back seat.</p><p>Yori found the hospital and drove into a parking spot. He turned off the car, got out, and walked to the rear and woke up Takumijo. Satoshi scooted out of the passenger seat and closed the door.</p><p>\"Why are we at a hospital?\" Takumijo asked getting out of the car, stretching and trying to fix his clothes.</p><p>\"Shaundra's here,\" Yori said.</p><p>\"What?\" Takumijo said stumbling behind them as they walked to the door.</p><p>\"She didn't die in the earthquake?\"</p><p>\"No, she didn't. She was rescued and brought here,\" Yori told him.</p><p>\"Are you sure?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Satoshi said. \"I hired an investigator and met with the guy who rescued her.\" He paused. \"This is a story within itself.\"</p><p>They entered the hospital and hurried to the triage desk.</p><p>The nurse looked up startled. \"How can I help you gentlemen?\"</p><p>Yori bowed. \"We are looking for our sister-in-law. She was brought here right after the earthquake in Miyagi and apparently has been in a coma.\"</p><p>\"What is the patient's name?\"</p><p>\"Shaundra Yoshida,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>The nurse checked the computer. \"Ah, yes, the sleeping beauty.\"</p><p>\"That's her,\" Yori said.</p><p>\"I'm sorry,\" the nurse said. \"She checked out two days ago.\"</p><p>Satoshi slumped against the desk. \"How can a comatose patient sign herself out?\"</p><p>\"The records say she was discharged, which means she woke up.\"</p><p>\"Do they say who she left with?\" Yori asked in typical Yori fashion.</p><p>\"No,\" the nurse said fanning herself and fighting off his glare. \"But you might want to speak to one of the nursing staff on the fourth floor. One of them might remember.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\" Yori said bowing gallantly.</p><p>The three of them ran toward the elevator. Yori pushed the button. The elevator arrived and they hurried inside. Satoshi pushed the fourth floor button and the doors closed.</p><p>Yori sighed. Where has she gone?</p><p>The doors opened on the fourth floor and they stepped out. The area was very busy. They hurried over to the desk getting more than one curious glance from the patients and nurses.</p><p>\"We're trying to find our sister-in-law,\" Yori began. \"Her name is Shaundra Yoshida.\"</p><p>\"The sleeping beauty,\" the nurse behind the desk replied.</p><p>\"I'm sorry, she checked out two days ago.\"</p><p>\"When did she wake up?\" Satoshi asked impatiently.</p><p>\"Three days ago.\"</p><p>\"Do you remember if she left under her own ability or did someone come for her?\"</p><p>\"An American gentleman, about forty, with blond hair came for her. He dressed real nice.\"</p><p>\"Harper,\" Yori and Satoshi said together.</p><p>Takumijo looked at them blankly. \"I'm so lost, and still hung over,\" he reminded them.</p><p>\"Harper has Shaundra and has known where she was since she disappeared,\" Yori replied angrily. \"Thank you,\" he said to the nurse. He led then away from the desk.</p><p>\"How are we going to find them?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Harper has a place here in Tokyo,\" Satoshi replied. He pulled out his cell phone and dialed a number. \"Mr. Sato. Get me the address of Harper Kehoe, Tokyo, Japan.\" He pulled out a pad and pen, leaned against the wall by the elevator and took the information down. He got off the phone. \"He has two places. One close by and the other near the sea shore.\"</p><p>\"Sea shore,\" both Takumijo and Yori said.</p><p>Satoshi agreed. \"Let's go.\"</p><p>The sun felt good on her face.</p><p>\"Are you comfortable?\" Harper asked as he topped off the sunscreen lotion he just rubbed into her skin.</p><p>\"Very,\" Shaundra said lying back against the beach chair.</p><p>\"It's a beautiful day and I'm alive.\"</p><p>Harper smiled and walked over to the beach chair and sat down. \"It's good to get out every now and then and just enjoy nature.\" He settled back in the lounger.</p><p>\"How did you manage to get off from work?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"Perks of being the boss,\" he answered.</p><p>Shaundra reached over and grabbed a glass of iced tea, sipped, and returned it to the small table between them.</p><p>Harper had been wonderful, making sure she ate and took her medicine. He also covered her with a blanket to make sure she didn't get a chill. It was just early summer but there was still a little chill in the air even though the sun was out. She closed her eyes, feeling safe and content.</p><p>\"Company's coming,\" Harper said.</p><p>Shaundra lifted her glasses and peered down the road at a black Expedition. She pushed the glasses back over her eyes.</p><p>\"Someone you know?\"</p><p>\"Possibly,\" Harper said. \"But I can't think offhand who it could be.\"</p><p>The Expedition came to a halt along the water's edge and three six feet, well-dressed Korean males exited.</p><p>\"Shit,\" Harper said.</p><p>They were upon him before he could do anything.</p><p>Shaundra's eyes widened as Takumijo pulled Harper off the lounge chair. His fist connected with Harper's jaw.</p><p>\"Wait fellows, let me explain,\" Harper said as Yori got behind him and held him while Takumijo worked him over.</p><p>Satoshi walked over to her. \"Princess?\"</p><p>Shaundra lifted her glasses. \"Satoshi.\"</p><p>Satoshi removed his shades and dropped to his knees in the sand beside her. \"We have been so worried.\" He voice sounded strangled. \"We thought you were dead.\"</p><p>\"Stop them,\" Shaundra begged him. \"They're going to kill him.\"</p><p>\"He deserves to die,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>Harper sank down to his knees in the sand and Yori released him. Takumijo stopped hitting.</p><p>\"It isn't his fault,\" Shaundra protested loudly.</p><p>They walked toward her.</p><p>\"The bastard knew where you were and deliberately lied to us,\" Yori screamed at her.</p><p>\"He just found out three days ago where I was and I asked him not to tell anyone until I got back on my feet.\"</p><p>\"We are your family,\" Takumijo said. \"What could be so bad that you couldn't tell us you were alive?\"</p><p>\"Don't Shaundra,\" Harper warned getting up and walking slowly back to the lounge chair. \"Don't tell them.\"</p><p>\"They're going to find out sooner or later,\" Shaundra said sweeping the blanket aside and rising.</p><p>\"Oh shit,\" Takumijo said looking at her.</p><p>Satoshi whimpered and sank back down on his knees like a wounded puppy.</p><p>\"You're pregnant,\" Yori said sweeping her up into his arms.</p><p>\"Put me down,\" Shaundra demanded, beating her fists against his shoulders.</p><p>\"No, I'm taking you home to your husband,\" Yori said adamantly.</p><p>\"No, you can't do that,\" Shaundra begged.</p><p>\"Why can't I?\" Yori asked.</p><p>Satoshi got up. \"Is this the reason why you left him?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded, trying to hold back the tears and onto Yori as the same time.</p><p>\"Let's go inside and discuss this,\" Harper said, rubbing the blood away from his bottom lip. \"She's too fragile to be jostled by you bunch of thugs.\"</p><p>\"You've put on a lot of weight,\" Yori said, ignoring Harper's comment.</p><p>\"Bite me,\" Shaundra told him.</p><p>Yori pulled her to him protectively and kissed her on the forehead. \"I would if it would make this all better,\" he whispered to her. He carried her toward the condo.</p><p>\"This better be good,\" Satoshi said to Harper. \"Or Ichiro is going to erase you from the face of the earth.\"</p><p>\"She's worth dying for,\" Harper said limping toward the condo. He opened the door with his key and stepped aside as Yori carried Shaundra inside and placed her on the sofa.</p><p>Yori stood in front of her looking down on her like he wanted to strangle her.</p><p>Harper limped off to the bathroom.</p><p>\"You guys ought to be ashamed of yourselves. You could have killed him.\"</p><p>All three of them look at her nonapologetically.</p><p>\"Is he the father?\" Yori asked.</p><p>Shaundra glared at him. \"No.\"</p><p>Yori's shoulders relaxed. \"Your breasts are huge.\"</p><p>Shaundra rolled her eyes at him.</p><p>\"Real subtle,\" Satoshi said to him, pushing Yori aide and sitting down next to her on the sofa. He took her hands into his. \"Did you leave because of the baby, Shaundra?\"</p><p>\"Not exactly,\" she answered. \"I left because Ich and I were having problems and I got sick. He's twenty-five years old. It was wrong to saddle him with a sick wife.\"</p><p>\"We heard you had surgery,\" Yori said. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"You remember that tests they ran while I was in the hospital in Osaka?\"</p><p>All three nodded.</p><p>\"Well, I got the results back a couple of days before you were scheduled to leave for China. The doctor told me that I was pregnant and I didn't believe him. But I had complications because of my age and my high blood pressure.</p><p>He sent me to a doctor in Miyagi who specialized in women who got pregnant late in life. They had to see if the baby was going to be okay...that it wouldn't be deformed because of my age.\"</p><p>\"You could have told Ich,\" Yori said.</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. \"Tell him what? That a baby we created together might not survive? No, I couldn't tell him that. You saw how he reacted just because I danced with Yori.\"</p><p>Yori nodded. \"But he is still your husband. You should not have gone through this alone.\"</p><p>\"And apparently an earthquake occurred while I was on the operating table and I don't remember much after that. I woke up in a Tokyo hospital three days ago. That's when I called Harper. He was the only one I knew in Tokyo.\"</p><p>\"You were rescued by an anesthesiologist,\" Satoshi told her.</p><p>\"Yes, one of the nurses told me. She said he took care of me.\"</p><p>\"He's a real nice guy,\" Satoshi said. \"I met him yesterday.</p><p>That's how I found out you were in Tokyo.\"</p><p>\"You didn't tell Ich did you?\"</p><p>Satoshi shook his head. \"We didn't want to build up his hopes in case we were wrong,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"Where is he?\"</p><p>\"At the restaurant,\" Yori answered. \"The poor fool is a mess. He hasn't been the same since you left, and he's drinking sake and not speaking.\"</p><p>Shaundra's shoulders slumped. \"I'm divorcing him.\"</p><p>Satoshi's hand squeezed hers tightly. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"Because he needs to find someone who will be there for him, who he doesn't have to worry about.\"</p><p>Satoshi relaxed his grip.</p><p>\"But what about the baby?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"Babies,\" Shaundra corrected.</p><p>Yori dropped down to the floor at her feet. \"Excuse me?\"</p><p>\"Twins,\" Shaundra announced. \"They run in my family.\"</p><p>\"Ichiro is going to be so happy,\" Takumijo said.</p><p>\"Didn't you just hear her say she's divorcing him?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"You can't,\" Yori said with his eyes pinned on her stomach.</p><p>\"You will crush him. He is so fragile.\"</p><p>\"Yori, be realistic. He doesn't have time for me.\"</p><p>\"And what about you?\" Harper asked entering the room carrying a glass of milk for her. \"You'll have to raise those babies by yourself.\"</p><p>\"I've raised four others,\" Shaundra argued.</p><p>\"But your health.\"</p><p>\"Will be fine as long as I follow my diet and take it easy. It is the best thing to do.\"</p><p>\"No it isn't,\" Takumijo said. \"Ichiro loves you more than anything else in the world, and he will love little Takumijo and little Satoshi just as much.\"</p><p>Shaundra smiled sheepishly. \"What if they are girls?\"</p><p>\"We don't make girls,\" Takumijo bragged. \"We are Aomori.\"</p><p>The fact that she knew that none of them had any children made his answer sound crazy but endearing. Coming from him it meant a lot. \"I can't go back the way I left fellows. He will hate me.\"</p><p>Satoshi shook his head. \"No, he won't. He's on the verge of committing hara-kiri. You have to go back to him.\"</p><p>\"The guys are right,\" Harper said. \"You can't fly back to the United States in your condition anyway. You need a special diet and who better to make sure you eat right than your husband.\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Shaundra said lowering her head. Her stomach moved and Yori gasped.</p><p>\"May I?\" he asked.</p><p>Shaundra nodded. She might as well get used to it. The babies moved again and Yori actually smiled and chuckled. He removed his hands quickly and turned to Harper. \"I'm sorry for misjudging you.\"</p><p>\"And hitting him,\" Shaundra added.</p><p>\"No,\" Both Takumijo and Yori answered simultaneously.</p><p>\"I love you guys too,\" Harper said. \"But the next time you get a penchant to punch someone punch Masaaki.\"</p><p>\"Masaaki?\" Yori said. \"I forgot about him. We need to get Shaundra back.\" He rose.</p><p>\"Today?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"It's time, princess.\"</p><p>\"I'll get your things,\" Harper said.</p><p>Shaundra sighed. Ichiro is going to hate me so much.</p><p>It was late when they arrived at the mansion in Osaka.</p><p>Yori got out the car and carried Shaundra up the stairs while Satoshi and Takumijo got out of the Expedition. They had treated her like an invalid all the way home, insisting that she wear her coat, which swallowed her and made her look fat and stupid in July.</p><p>Shaundra looked at the farmhouse and fought back the tears. She'd never expected to see this place again. \"I don't know if I can do it,\" she told Satoshi as Yori put her down on her feet.</p><p>\"I'll hold your hand and won't leave your side.\" He opened the door and led her inside while Takumijo carried her things.</p><p>Yori entered last. \"I wonder if he's home.\"</p><p>\"You wonder if who's home?\" Masaaki asked suddenly appearing on the stairwell. He took one look at her and his eyes widened. \"Oh my!\"</p><p>Satoshi put his finger to his lips.</p><p>Masaaki hurried the rest of the way down and hugged her.</p><p>\"You're alive and you're...\"</p><p>\"I'm afraid so,\" Shaundra said.</p><p>\"Where's Ich?\" Yori asked Masaaki.</p><p>\"He's in the den drinking sake,\" Masaaki replied. \"He can't sleep and I was just coming down to check on him.\"</p><p>Satoshi took her hand and walked her down the hall slowly until they arrived at the den. The others stayed back to talk with Masaaki. \"Wait here,\" he told her.</p><p>Shaundra nodded.</p><p>Satoshi opened the door and stepped inside, closing the door behind him. Shaundra heard some arguing and a glass hit the wall. She jumped. What were those two imbeciles up to? Yori and Takumijo ran down the hall toward her and entered the den. There was more noise and what sounded like fighting. The door opened a few minutes later and Satoshi grabbed her hand. He looked like someone had beaten the shit out of him. \"Ich, there's someone here that wants to see you.\"</p><p>\"Go to hell,\" Ichiro shouted.</p><p>\"That's my cue,\" Shaundra said letting go of Satoshi's hand. She entered the den and Satoshi followed her in. The den looked completely destroyed and Takumijo and Yori looked like death warmed over.</p><p>Ichiro's back was to her as he leaned against the desk.</p><p>\"Ichiro,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>\"Didn't I tell you to go away, Satoshi?\"</p><p>\"Ichiro,\" Shaundra said.</p><p>Ichiro spun around at the sound of her voice and looked at her through bleary eyes. \"Get out,\" he shouted at Yori, Takumijo, and Satoshi. \"Leave us.\"</p><p>The three men scurried out of the room. What happened to Satoshi's statement of being there for her? Apparently a drunken Ichiro was more of a lethal weapon than a sober one by the look of the fellows and the room.</p><p>\"Is it you, Shaundra?\" He asked approaching cautiously and menacingly. \"Or are you a dream come home to torture me?\"</p><p>\"It's me, Ich.\"</p><p>He walked around her. The stench of sake reeked from his pores. \"What are you doing here?\"</p><p>Shaundra shrugged. She was asking herself the same question. \"The fellows brought me home.\"</p><p>\"How? You died in the tsunami?\"</p><p>Yup, he was so drunk that he thought he was talking to a spirit. \"No, I didn't die, Ich. They found me in a hospital in Tokyo.\" She walked slowly away from him and turned on the overhead lights so he could see her better.</p><p>\"You've put on some weight. What did they feed you in heaven?\"</p><p>Oh, my precious Ichiro. She heard the sorrow and pain in his voice. She walked back over to him and reached up and touched his cheek like she used to do.</p><p>Ichiro grabbed her hand and pushed it away. \"Stay away from me, jezebel. I will not be tempted.\"</p><p>He still didn't believe it was her. \"It's me, baby.\"</p><p>Ichiro rubbed at his eyes and blinked as he tried to come to grasp at the situation before him. \"Shaundra? Is it really you?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"Yes, baby it's me.\"</p><p>He walked back over to her, touched her face and sniffed her. He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her to him.</p><p>\"I thought you were dead.\"</p><p>Tears filled Shaundra's eyes. \"It's a long story.\"</p><p>He pulled away from her. His eyes glimmered with tears.</p><p>Shaundra removed her coat and let it drop to the floor.</p><p>Ichiro's eyes widened and registered shock. He sank to his knees, hugging her around her swollen abdomen. The babies picked this time to be active, moving around beneath his arms. \"Oh, my precious Shaundra, you've come back to me and you've brought me the most delightful present.\"</p><p>\"We're expecting,\" she told him as the tears streamed down from her eyes. More out of sympathy for him than for herself. What the fuck could she do to make this right?</p><p>\"Twins.\"</p><p>She knocked him speechless, but not tearless. Her big baby broke down. He swept her up into his arms and placed her on the sofa gently. \"Why, baby?\" he asked kneeling before her.</p><p>Big crocodile tears streamed from those big blue eyes.</p><p>\"Why did you leave me?\"</p><p>\"Because I loved you too much to stay and tie you down, Ich. You are a very important singer and business man and I'm just a little pebble of sand who took advantage of your youth for my own selfish desires.\"</p><p>Ichiro placed his hands on her stomach and the babies moved beneath his touch. \"My babies. You have made me the happiest man on earth. It is a miracle.\"</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"A miracle. You could not have babies and I prayed every night since I married you for the Lord to make you fertile again. I know how much you wanted to do this for me and couldn't.\"</p><p>\"But you're still a baby, Ich.\"</p><p>Ichiro gently rubbed her abdomen. \"Not really, I've grown a lot emotionally since I've met you.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Mama we were so worried,\" Tricia cried into the receiver of the phone after Shaundra finally decided to call her family and put them out of their misery. \"We didn't know what to think when Ichiro called. The last thing I remembered was that you were leaving him and Japan and coming home.\"</p><p>\"That was the plan,\" Shaundra replied. \"But a big damn earthquake and tsunami stopped me.\" There were still some things about that day that she couldn't remember.</p><p>\"We prepared for the worst, but I didn't feel it in my heart that you were dead.\"</p><p>\"I kind of figured the Lord had something special planned for me,\" Shaundra told her.</p> <p>\"How are you feeling? Are you staying away from salt and taking your medications?\" Tricia asked.</p><p>\"I'm fine and yes, I'm following the doctor's orders to the letter. But baby there's something I have to tell you.\"</p><p>\"Please don't tell me you're a diabetic.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"No, but I have gained a lot of weight recently.\"</p><p>\"I don't believe that. What have you been gorging yourself with?\"</p> <p>\"Love,\" she replied. \"Ichiro and I are expecting a baby.\"</p><p>There was a pause. \"Expecting what?\" Tricia finally asked.</p><p>\"A baby.\"</p><p>Another paused. \"You mean you're considering adopting a baby. Juanda did mention that to me a few months back when she called to tell me that my mother was involved in yet another scandal on YouTube.\" She chuckled. \"My friends at school think you are so cool. And they're reading your books.</p><p>I'm sort of a celebrity by proxy.\"</p><p>\"Congratulations. I hope you're actually getting some classes in and not hanging out in the recreation hall.\"</p> <p>\"No, I'm working hard and my grades are fantastic.\"</p><p>Tricia was a journalism major and dreamed of traveling the world and writing articles for big-name magazines.</p><p>\"Now back to what I was trying to tell you. I'm pregnant.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Tricia asked. \"How can you be pregnant? Aren't women your age supposed to be menopausal or something?\"</p><p>\"Apparently not,\" Shaundra answered. \"I still had a period, but I noticed that it had thinned out some over the years, but there was still some spotting once a month...nothing heavy so I figured I was sliding into perimenopause, but apparently Ichiro has some mighty powerful sperm.\"</p><p>\"Aww, gross Mama,\" Tricia said. \"I must have the only mother in the world who has no problem discussing her sordid sex life with and a hot Asian pop singer with her impressionable daughter.\"</p><p>Tricia was such an innocent and hated it when she spoke about sex.</p><p>\"Are you sure? Have you taken tests?\"</p> <p>\"Yes, in fact I was hospitalized in the beginning. The change in my hormones sent my pressure up to record proportion and I blacked out. Satoshi and Takumijo found me unconscious lying on the floor in my bedroom and rushed me to the hospital. That's when the test was done and sure enough they found a bun in the oven.\" She paused. \"Two buns in the oven to be exact.\"</p><p>Tricia screamed so loudly that Shaundra had to remove the receiver away from her ear. \"Are you serious? I'm going to be a big sister?\"</p><p>\"Yes, you're going to be a big sister.\"</p><p>\"That mean I'm going to have someone to boss around.</p><p>You know being the baby in the family is sorely overrated.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. Tricia was a bit melodramatic.</p><p>\"When are they due?\"</p><p>\"Late September or early October,\" Shaundra replied. \"But I think the doctor is going to put me in the hospital before then. He's very concerned because of my hypertension.\"</p><p>\"What does Ichiro think about all of this?\" Tricia asked.</p><p>Shaundra refused to tell her the story that led up to Ichiro finding out. Some things were better left unsaid. \"He couldn't be happier. I swear the man is walking around on a cloud.\"</p><p>\"And he should be. So everything is okay between the two of you?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Shaundra lied. \"Things are great.\" Well they were better than they were before she decided to leave him. He was spending more time at home and he'd hired someone to help with the construction of the new restaurants in Kyoto.</p><p>\"Try not to deliver until October,\" Tricia said. \"I'll try to come for visit.\"</p><p>Unlike her, her kids were not afraid to fly. \"That would be just the best thing ever,\" Shaundra said. \"And I know Satoshi will be glad to see you.\"</p><p>\"How is he?\" Tricia asked.</p><p>\"Still Satoshi. Very inquisitive and a bit of a devil and also becoming one of my dearest friends.\"</p><p>\"Define that.\"</p><p>\"No, I'm not sharing my bed with him if that's what you're thinking. I swear. I don't know where I got this reputation from. If these guys weren't idols, no one would think anything of me dancing or talking to them.\"</p><p>Tricia squealed again. \"I'm going to be a big sister. I can't wait to see them. I bet they will be beautiful babies with long jet black hair and blue eyes.\"</p><p>\"Blue eyes are rare in Asia. Ichiro is just so special, but I don't think the babies will have blue eyes. Don't forget they will have an African American mother.\"</p><p>\"True, but you are beautiful, so they are bound to take after you.\"</p><p>\"I'm just hoping for healthy,\" Shaundra said, suddenly feeling hungry. She looked over at the clock. It was very late in the United States. \"You better get off this phone and go to bed. I'm sure you've got a test or something to take tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"Okay, Mama. I can take a hint. I'll call to check up on you in a couple of days. Please try to stay out of trouble until then.\"</p><p>Shaundra grimaced. \"Bye baby.\" She hung up the phone.</p><p>Why did everyone think she was a troublemaker?</p><p>The door to the bedroom opened and Ichiro came in carrying a tray of food. Right on time. She wondered if he'd heard her stomach growl.</p><p>\"Good morning, beautiful wifey,\" he said placing the tray on the table next to the bed. \"How are you feeling?\"</p><p>\"Like a beached whale. You know you didn't have to go to all this trouble. I'm perfectly capable of coming downstairs and eating at the table with the guys.\"</p><p>\"The doctor said you have to take it easy and be on bed rest.\" He had escorted her to a doctor's office the day after she came back home. \"I've looked up the fancy terms he said so don't try to fool me.\"</p><p>Shaundra smiled smugly. He was getting too big for his britches.</p><p>\"And besides it gives me some alone time with you.\" He spread a napkin onto her lap, place some of the bowls on a smaller tray, and then he pulled the chair up to the bed. He started lifting the tops of the bowls, displaying succulent no- salt dishes.</p><p>\"I hope you plan on sharing some of this food with me,\"</p><p>Shaundra said.</p><p>\"No, I've already eaten,\" he said. He sat down and lifted a bowl. \"But I plan to feed you.\" He uncovered a bowl of grits and scooped some into a spoon and fed it to her.</p><p>While she chewed Ichiro sat patiently watching and then her stomach moved. His eyes widened and then he smiled.</p><p>Shaundra's heart flipped. Damn traitorous babies loved him already. She sighed. And to think he was prepared to sacrifice the fatherhood experience to be with her.</p><p>Ichiro lifted the tray aside, moved the covers off her, lifted her gown, and waited for her stomach to move again. The babies responded and wiggled. His hands covered the spot.</p><p>\"Little Satoshi is very frisky,\" he replied. He leaned and kissed the spot. I can't wait to start parenting and Lamaze classes.\"</p><p>\"I hope you'll be just as excited with two am feedings and poopy diaper changes.\"</p><p>He lowered her gown and re-covered her. \"I plan to help you one-hundred percent,\" he said.</p><p>Shaundra grimaced. She'd heard that line before. Four other times to be exact.</p><p>Someone knocked at the door.</p><p>\"Come in,\" Ichiro said after making sure she was decent.</p><p>Satoshi entered. \"I just came up to see how you're feeling.\"</p><p>\"I'm okay,\" Shaundra said as Ichiro fed her another spoonful of grits.</p><p>Satoshi crawled into the bed and lay down next to her. He rose up on his elbow and watched.</p><p>Ichiro looked but did not comment.</p><p>\"Are you sure?\" Satoshi asked. \"Because I don't want you to overdo it.\"</p><p>\"Thanks for the concern. Why are you in our bed?\"</p><p>Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"Because we've all decided to share the experience. These are our first babies and we don't want to miss a moment. Plus this may be the only chance of being in a bed with you,\" he said batting his eyelashes at her.</p><p>\"You got that part right,\" Ichiro said. \"Just this once. I don't want you to get any ideas of a threesome in the near future. You're cute, but not that cute.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"I'm already a threesome. But I won't lie. I have thought about what it would be like with the two of you.\"</p><p>Ichiro opened his mouth to protest.</p><p>Shaundra winked at him \"So what was it like?\" Satoshi asked suddenly interested.</p><p>\"This fantasy of yours?\"</p><p>\"A lot like it is now with one of you getting very jealous.\"</p><p>\"I am not jealous,\" Ichiro said. \"And you better only be fantasizing for your books. These guys are still off-limits, especially this one.\"</p><p>Shaundra reached over and ruffled Satoshi's hair and then stroked his brow. \"Sorry. I'll just have to visit you in my dreams.\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled and slid out of the bed. \"I'll take that for now.\" He headed toward the door. \"Seriously do you need anything?\"</p><p>\"I might have to go out shopping. I need bigger clothes.\"</p><p>\"I don't think you have to worry about that,\" he said.</p><p>\"Apparently Harper has anticipated your needs. Boxes have been arriving all morning from every maternity boutique in Japan.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"It's true,\" Ichiro said. \"Even though I don't understand why he's buying my pregnant wife clothes.\" He sighed. \"They are piling up in the den. That man is so strange.\"</p><p>There is nothing strange about him. Harper is kind and loving and so not supposed to be on my mind at the moment.</p><p>\"I'm surprised he's thinking of me after...\"</p><p>\"After what?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"Nothing,\" Shaundra said remembering the terrible beating he suffered at the hands of Yori and Takumijo.</p><p>\"I better go,\" Satoshi said trying to escape before he would have to explain their actions.</p><p>\"I know you two are hiding something from me,\" Ichiro said. \"I won't ask you to explain because I have more important things to do like feed my two sons.\"</p><p>\"That's too much food for them,\" Satoshi said looking over at the big tray.</p><p>\"I'm not talking about feeding them that way,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>\"Yuck,\" Satoshi said this time hurrying to the door. \"No explanations necessary.\"</p><p>The door closed and Ichiro got up and locked it. \"No more distractions. You need to eat.\"</p><p>By now the grits were cold and the food in her stomach started to protest. \"Ich I think I'm going to be sick.\"</p><p>Ichiro moved the food and Shaundra made a mad dash for the bathroom.</p><p>Oh, my poor baby, Ichiro thought as he held Shaundra's shoulder-length hair back as she threw up everything he'd fed her. Finally it was nothing but drive heaves.</p><p>He helped her rise to her feet, flushed the toilet and put the seat down. Shaundra sat down on top of it looking exhausted.</p><p>\"I'd change places with you if I could,\" Ichiro told her, wetting a washcloth and using it to wipe her face, brow and neck.</p><p>\"No you wouldn't,\" she replied. \"Men say that but they don't mean it.\" She rose, walked over to the sink, and brushed her teeth and gargled. Then she turned on the shower and began shucking out of her soiled nightgown and underwear.</p><p>Ichiro watched fascinated at how her body had changed since the last time he had seen her naked over four months ago. Her breasts had grown bigger and full, her hips had spread, and her butt looked bouncier. His eyes landed on her swollen abdomen. The doctor had explained that she was showing so much because of having two babies instead of one inside of her. There was no way she could hide the fact that she was pregnant from anyone. He smiled. It must have come to quite a surprise to her when she actually heard the words from the doctor's lips. \"Do you need any help?\" he asked after he cleaned up the bathroom and put her dirty clothes into the hamper.</p><p>\"I think you've helped enough,\" she snapped at him.</p><p>Oh, oh hormones. The doctor had told him about that too.</p><p>From what he had read on the subject some women had some serious mood swings. He sat down on the toilet seat and waited. Moments later she exited, dripping wet from head to toe. Ichiro grabbed two towels, wrapped one around her hair, and began toweling her off with the other, surprised as his body's response after witnessing her vomiting no more than fifteen minutes ago. He wrapped the towel around her while he stepped out of the bathroom to get her robe.</p><p>\"Here slip this on,\" he told her helping her out the towel.</p><p>The robe barely buttoned.</p><p>Shaundra glared at him.</p><p>\"Don't kill me. I'll buy you a bigger one today,\" he told her.</p><p>\"So, you're saying I'm fat?\"</p><p>Ichiro's eyes widened. Wrong choice of words. \"No, I just think a bigger robe would be more comfortable for the babies.\"</p><p>Shaundra rolled her eyes at him and walked past him and entered the bedroom. She sat down at the vanity prepared to tackle her hair. She removed the towel. Her hair had curled in an interesting pattern of thick curls that looked like an Afro.</p><p>Ichiro took out the blow dryer, the diffuser and looked for the biggest comb he could find.</p><p>\"There is no way you can comb my hair with that,\" she said pointing at the wide-tooth comb. \"I have an afro pick and a bush comb in the top right drawer.\"</p><p>Ichiro left her and found the combs. \"I don't know where to begin. It's just so much.\"</p><p>\"Regardless of what you may believe African American sisters all don't have good hair.\"</p><p>Ooh, she was pulling the race card. Maybe he should let her do it. He handed her the dryer and watched her go to work on her mane. A half hour later it lay down her back after she flat ironed it. \"Damn babies,\" she muttered as she rose from the chair and climbed back into bed.</p><p>He still had a raging hard-on but he was afraid she'd neutered him. \"Can I ask you a question? How long is all this going to last?\"</p><p>\"All of what?\"</p><p>\"That,\" he said indicating her attitude.</p><p>\"Three more months give or take a day,\" Shaundra answered angrily.</p><p>Ichiro bowed. \"Maybe I should go and let you get some rest.\"</p><p>\"Good idea,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>Ichiro gathered up the trays of food and hightailed it out of the room. He found Takumijo and Satoshi seated at the breakfast table looking lonely and depressed. \"What are you lumps doing?\"</p><p>\"Waiting for our breakfast,\" Takumijo replied.</p><p>Ichiro frowned at them. \"You mean to tell me that you guys were too lazy to get your food out of the kitchen?\"</p><p>\"You have us spoiled,\" Satoshi replied flipping his bangs out of his eyes. \"It's not our fault you knocked up Shaundra and have to see to her needs first.\"</p><p>Takumijo shook his head in agreement. \"I knew things were going to change the moment I saw that big belly.\"</p><p>\"You'd better not let her hear you say anything about her weight,\" Ichiro warned carrying the tray into the kitchen and returning a few minutes later with their breakfast and a cup of tea for himself. He sat down after he served them.</p><p>\"What's wrong with you?\" Satoshi asked him.</p><p>\"I don't think I'm going to make it three more months,\"</p><p>Ichiro confessed. \"Shaundra's like Linda Blair in The Exorcist.\"</p><p>Takumijo nearly choked on his food. \"What do you mean?\"</p><p>\"She's all nice and loving one minute and then she tries to snap my head off the next.\"</p><p>\"Which head?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>Ichiro threw him a murderous look. \"We never even got that far. She got morning sickness right after you got out of bed and left the room.</p><p>Takumijo nearly choked again. \"Huh?\"</p><p>\"Long story,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>\"Maybe I should have stayed,\" Satoshi replied. \"Apparently the babies prefer my company to yours.\"</p><p>\"You guys had a threesome?\" Takumijo asked suddenly interested.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Satoshi lied.</p><p>\"Hell no,\" Ichiro replied. \"Satoshi is just trying to be funny.</p><p>I asked her one simple question when she finished showering and she turned on me, blaming her condition on me and damning the babies.\"</p><p>\"Hormones,\" Takumijo said going back to his meal.</p><p>\"That the same thing I thought,\" Ichiro said. \"But I kept waiting for her eyes to change colors like they do when a person is possessed by the devil.\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"Better get used to it. Three months is a very long time.\"</p><p>\"I don't think I can go without sex that long,\" Ichiro replied. \"I've waited four months already and her breasts are humongous now.\"</p><p>Satoshi stopped chewing. \"Define humongous.\"</p><p>Ichiro showed their size with his hands.</p><p>\"No,\" Satoshi said with a moan. \"And I was lying up real close to them.\"</p><p>\"I would feel sorry for you if I didn't feel sorry for myself,\"</p><p>Ichiro said with a groan. \"When is Cristal due back?\"</p><p>\"Saturday,\" Satoshi replied. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"Because I might have to take her up on her kind offer to be the cream in our cookie.\"</p><p>Takumijo spat food. \"What?\"</p><p>\"You heard me. I'm getting desperate,\" Ichiro said with a groan.</p><p>\"No way, Jose,\" Satoshi told him. \"Cristal is off-limits.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" Ichiro asked. \"You shared her with Yi-jun, Hyung.\"</p><p>Satoshi glared at him. \"You touch her and I'll kick your ass.\"</p><p>Ichiro smirked at Takumijo. \"Did I threaten to kick your ass this morning when you crawled into bed with my wife?</p><p>This is a family. We share.\"</p><p>\"There's nothing in the world you can do or say to get me to agree with that,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>Ichiro took down his hair and shook it in front of his face.</p><p>Satoshi stopped what he was doing and looked at it.</p><p>\"You don't need Cristal,\" Takumijo replied going back to his meal. \"Satoshi's yours for the taking.\"</p><p>Ichiro batted his eyes at Satoshi who looked at him all dreamy.</p><p>\"Do you think he's serious?\" Satoshi asked Takumijo.</p><p>Takumijo shrugged.</p><p>Ichiro enjoyed bating Satoshi. \"Cristal likes my hair.\"</p><p>That snapped him out of the stare. \"You bastard.\"</p><p>Ichiro and Takumijo chuckled.</p><p>\"What are you going to do? Are you just going to let Yi-jun have her?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Satoshi said. \"But if I were you I'd put that hair away.\" He pointed toward Takumijo.</p><p>Takumijo was teasing him, running his tongue over his bottom lip.</p><p>Ichiro fixed his hair quickly. \"I forgot about him.\"</p><p>\"Maybe we should put him out of his misery,\" Satoshi said suddenly switching the game.</p><p>Takumijo nodded. \"Just say the word and I'll be all over him.\"</p><p>\"You guys are horrible,\" Ichiro said rising. \"You can't take a joke.\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"No, but we could rock your world baby.\"</p><p>\"You guys better be kidding. I am not a girl and I've put two buns in Shaundra's oven.\"</p><p>\"Well it is either Shaundra or us to help your little problem because Cristal is off-limits,\" Takumijo replied.</p><p>\"I think I'll just go take a cold shower,\" Ichiro replied dashing out of the kitchen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Damn, you're fat,\" Amaya said as she entered the den where Shaundra was standing, leafing through some movies.</p><p>\"Thank you,\" Shaundra replied trying to ignore her, especially since Yori eyes pleaded with her not to kill his wife.</p><p>\"Where the hell have you been? If I were Ichiro, I would be wondering if he's the babies' father.\"</p><p>Shaundra glared at her. Pregnant or no she'd take her ass out. \"True, they could even be Yori's.\"</p> <p>Amaya's mouth opened like a carp and then closed.</p><p>\"Nonsense. My husband would not touch you with a ten-foot pole.\"</p><p>Yori nodded that he would behind Amaya's back.</p><p>\"I think I better get back to my room before I do something I won't regret. Make yourself at home Amaya, or go back to your own. There's food in the kitchen.\"</p><p>Yori stopped her. \"How are you feeling?\"</p> <p>\"Bitchy,\" Shaundra replied. \"What are you guys doing here?\"</p><p>\"Brainstorming with the fellows. We need to come up with our next career move.\"</p><p>\"I don't know about your next career move but if I were you I'd get her pregnant as soon as possible and work some of that venom out of her system.\"</p><p>Yori chuckled. \"Amaya does not want any kids at the moment.\"</p><p>Shaundra sighed. \"Poor choice. You need some kids and she needs to get that stick out her butt.\"</p><p>\"At least my butt is not spreading all across Japan,\" Amaya shot back just as bitchy.</p> <p>\"Yori doesn't think it too big, do you, Yori?\" Shaundra asked him.</p><p>\"No, it's exemplary.\"</p><p>\"What are you doing?\" Ichiro asked Shaundra as he walked into the den.</p><p>\"Fucking with Amaya.\"</p><p>He pushed her gently toward the door. \"Hormones,\" he explained to Yori.</p><p>Yori looked at her and she winked to get his attention and to piss Amaya and Ichiro off. There was nothing wrong with her hormones and just because she was pregnant she still refused to be a punching bag for Amaya.</p><p>\"I'll give your advice considerations,\" Yori said to her bowing. \"Try not to tire yourself out.\"</p><p>\"I'm cool,\" Shaundra said looking back at him as Ichiro led her out.</p> <p>\"Why are you screwing with Yori's head?\" Ichiro asked her.</p><p>\"Because I'm bored. I just came down for a movie and Amaya started in on me.\"</p><p>\"I know you can take her but don't.\"</p><p>A cold shower hadn't done a damn thing for him. Ichiro was still packing one serious erection. One she chose to ignore. She hadn't forgotten that argument. Some things could not go unpunished. She planned to let him squirm for a while.</p><p>\"Do you need me to do anything for you before I go back downstairs?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"No, I'm cool,\" she said sitting in her computer chair. \"I have to get back to work.\"</p><p>\"Do you think you might try to eat something later?\"</p><p>\"I know my way to the kitchen,\" Shaundra replied. \"You go brainstorm with Aomori.\" She actually meant it. She still did not want to be a burden to him or come between him and his music.</p><p>Ichiro bowed to her and left.</p><p>Shaundra slipped her glasses on her eyes and turned her laptop back on.</p><p>Ichiro shook his head and walked back downstairs. Yori and Amaya were in a heated discussion. He was just about to walk past the den door and head for the recording studio when he heard his name.</p><p>\"How does he know he's even the father? For all he knows they could be Harper's babies,\" Amaya said. \"Or Satoshi's or even yours.\"</p><p>Ichiro waited for Yori to deny the allegation.</p><p>\"They are Ichiro's babies.\"</p><p>\"How can you be so sure? All of you are forgetting that she walked out on him. Why? Because she found out that she was pregnant with another man's child.\"</p><p>\"Even if it is true it is none of your business. Regardless of what you think, Shaundra is not that kind of woman.\"</p><p>\"Oh, yes she is. She strung both you and Ichiro along for months. And you see the way she eyes Satoshi. My money is on him. Why did he let a perfectly good woman like Cristal get away? Because he knows those can be his babies. He used to be the biggest womanizer in Japan and had women going in and out of his bedroom like ants at a picnic. Think about it. When was the last time he went out on a date or had a woman in his life? Not since he met Shaundra.\"</p><p>\"He dated her daughter in the United States,\" Yori answered in Satoshi's defense.</p><p>\"All a show,\" Amaya replied. \"If those babies come here blond, they're Harpers. If they come here with blue eyes, they are Ichiro's. But if they come here with chocolate brown eyes, spiky hair and trying to look down the nurses blouse then they're Satoshi's.\"</p><p>\"What if they come out looking like me?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"Then you're going to find yourself single,\" Amaya answered.</p><p>Ichiro tipped past the den and hurried to the recording studio. Amaya was crazy. Shaundra would never cheat on him. He paused outside the door. But she had left him without a good reason. Could Satoshi be the babies' father?\"</p><p>A memory jumped into his mind. That smile at the hospital when she woke up. Him, hiring an investigator to find her.</p><p>Her stroking his brow tenderly while he lay next to her in bed.</p><p>Her crying herself to sleep the last time he tried to get romantic with her. He sighed. He would strangle them both it this turned out to be the truth.</p><p>What a horrible flight, Cristal thought as she unbuckled her seatbelt and got out of her seat. For the first time she could appreciate Shaundra's fear. For a moment there she didn't think they would make it over the sea for all the turbulence.</p><p>Add a less than pleasant visit with Yi-jun who most of the time was too busy to spend time with her and she could rate this vacation two out of a possible ten. Getting to see her parents made up the two points.</p><p>Cristal grabbed her bag and moved into the aisle to disembark with the rest of the passengers. A quick stop at customs and then to the baggage pickup area to claim her luggage. She saw crowds gathering near door. Shit. She slipped on her sunglasses. Fans. They were carrying signs with her name on it like she was a celebrity.</p><p>\"How is Yi-jun?\" one asked.</p><p>\"Fine,\" Cristal replied.</p><p>\"How was your trip to the United States?\"</p><p>\"Did you and Yi-jun elope?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Cristal answered. They didn't whatever either.</p><p>A tall pony-tailed Asian guy in a business suit and dark glasses approached. \"Welcome home, Cristal.\"</p><p>Another man, a tad taller and more muscular and clothed in black leather and sunglasses, sauntered over. \"Welcome home, princess.\" He bowed and kissed her hand. The crowd went wild instantly recognizing them.</p><p>\"It's Satoshi and Takumijo of Aomori,\" someone shouted.</p><p>\"I think that is our cue to leave,\" Satoshi said, taking her hand while Takumijo grabbed her luggage.</p><p>\"Where's the security?\" Cristal asked as Satoshi hurried her through the terminal and outside into the limousine where Kenshin waited.</p><p>\"Home guarding precious cargo,\" Satoshi replied as he and Takumijo climbed in. \"Let's get out of here, Kenny.\"</p><p>Kenshin maneuvered the black limousine from the curve and headed toward Osaka.</p><p>\"What precious cargo?\" Cristal asked as soon as she got her seatbelt secured.</p><p>\"Shaundra,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"What? You've found her?\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"She was in a hospital in Tokyo.\"</p><p>\"Is she okay? How badly is she injured?\"</p><p>\"She's more than okay,\" Satoshi said. \"She was rescued and flown to a hospital where she lay in a coma until a couple of weeks ago.\"</p><p>\"How's Ichiro? I bet he's excited?\"</p><p>Takumijo chuckled.</p><p>\"Why is he laughing?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"It's a secret. One you will find out when we arrive at the farmhouse. Now tell us about your trip to the United States.\"</p><p>\"Horrible. Seeing mom and dad was great even though they tried to talk me into returning home permanently. It was hot and I had to use sunscreen lotion every time I went out.\"</p><p>\"Noticed the tan,\" Satoshi replied. \"Very becoming. How was Yi-jun and don't spare any of the juicy details.\"</p><p>\"No juicy details,\" Cristal said with a sigh. \"I barely saw him. I don't think he realized how busy he was going to be when he invited me to join him in California. We had lunch once and I talked with him on the phone twice for about ten minutes.\"</p><p>\"Poor princess,\" Takumijo replied. \"Not exactly what you were expecting when you left us a month ago?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Cristal replied. \"And the flight back home was horrible. We hit so much turbulence. Now I understand what Shaundra went through. I thought I was going to die several times along the way.\"</p><p>\"Well I'm glad you didn't die. We've missed you,\" Satoshi said squeezing her hand gently.</p><p>\"Really?\" Cristal asked. With Satoshi she could never be sure if he was serious or not.</p><p>\"Yes, very much so. I'm sorry I was so busy before you left but I was preoccupied with finding Shaundra. None of us could go on until we had closure.\"</p><p>\"Why was she in a coma?\" Cristal asked noticing that he still held her hand.</p><p>\"I haven't told anyone yet so the four of you are sworn to secrecy. It was from the earthquake and tsunami. Apparently she saw some pretty horrific stuff so the doctor thinks she just shut her body down because she wasn't able to digest what she saw. So try not to ask her about it. She's still very delicate.\"</p><p>\"So there's not physiological damage?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"Not as far as I can tell,\" Takumijo replied. \"She's as feisty as ever.\"</p><p>\"Good. Did you guys ever find out why she left in the first place?\"</p><p>\"She and Ich were having some problems but they seem to have worked things out.\"</p><p>\"I'm afraid to ask about our other married couple.\"</p><p>\"They're adjusting to married life and their new home,\"</p><p>Takumijo said. \"But we do get to see Yori about once a day.</p><p>He claims he's just coming over to check on us but we know he's taking a break from Amaya.\"</p><p>\"I bet,\" Cristal said. \"How is he taking Shaundra's return?\"</p><p>\"Pretty good since he drove us to Tokyo to get her,\"</p><p>Satoshi answered.</p><p>\"What? And Amaya didn't complain?\"</p><p>Takumijo laughed. \"He didn't tell her. She was at work.\"</p><p>Cristal laughed. \"I don't understand him. He's married but for some reason he drops everything to go to Shaundra's rescue.\"</p><p>\"We would do the same thing for you,\" Takumijo replied.</p><p>\"We protect our womenfolk.\"</p><p>Cristal smirked. \"I'll remember that if I ever get into a fistfight in a bar.\"</p><p>\"We didn't interfere that time because it was common sense,\" Takumijo explained. \"We had to let Yori fix things since he screwed them up.\"</p><p>\"And the fans have forgiven him?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"He's lucky and none of them expects his marriage to Amaya to last. So there is always hope that he will get with one of them.\"</p><p>\"And Ichiro's marriage?\"</p><p>\"Holding its own for the moment,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"But our poor maknae is suffering. Shaundra has cut him off in the bedroom,\" Takumijo explained.</p><p>\"What? That is so uncharacteristic of her. Usually she's all over him.\"</p><p>\"Don't be surprised if he tries to take you up on your kind offer to be the center of our cookie.\"</p><p>Cristal blushed at Satoshi's words.</p><p>\"What are you talking about?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Cristal once volunteered to be the female in our menage if Ich and I decide to take our relationship to the next level,\"</p><p>Satoshi explained.</p><p>\"What? When did this happen and why wasn't I informed?\"</p><p>Takumijo asked playfully. \"You know I've been after Ichiro for year. Heck I was even thinking about taking him out on a date this weekend.\"</p><p>Cristal started to laugh. \"I missed you guys so much with your joking.\"</p><p>\"Who's joking?\" Takumijo asked pushing back in his seat.</p><p>Cristal continued to laugh. These guys were incorrigible.</p><p>\"So that brings me to you two. Have you been staying out of trouble?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>\"No,\" Takumijo answered. \"We came to the airport without security. Masaaki is bound to get hysterical.\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Satoshi said. \"He's been pretty busy since he has someone special in his life. He's mellowed some now that he's dating.\"</p><p>\"She's really pretty too,\" Kenshin replied from the front seat.</p><p>\"Spill it, Kenny,\" Takumijo told him.</p><p>\"She's a little older than he is and the daughter of an important CEO of some electronics company. He takes her to dinner and dancing and occasionally to the movies.\"</p><p>\"I wonder if he's getting any,\" Takumijo said rudely.</p><p>\"I can vouch that Masaaki stays at her place at least once a week and get this, he doesn't wear a suit on those nights,\"</p><p>Kenshin told them.</p><p>\"Definitely getting some,\" Satoshi replied. \"This means he's serious about her. I don't think I've seen him without a suit since we were younger.\"</p><p>\"Looks like we'll be making room for another female in the farmhouse,\" Takumijo said.</p><p>\"Speaking of that aren't you guys supposed to be moving out?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"The matter has been broached a couple of times but it will have to wait for a while. Ich needs us there,\" Satoshi told her.</p><p>\"To help care for Shaundra?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"Yes, for the time being. And we don't mind because we like cramping Ich's style.\"</p><p>Cristal smiled. Unfortunately her plans did not include camping out at the farmhouse permanently. She wanted her own place, and she needed her privacy. She'd find an apartment first and then tell Mr. Niigata.</p><p>Kenshin drove up to the gate. A security guard walked up to the window and checked them all out.</p><p>\"Why the drama?\" Cristal asked Satoshi.</p><p>\"I told you earlier. They're protecting precious cargo.\"</p><p>\"Aren't these the same guys who let Shaundra and Amaya fight without stopping them?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Takumijo answered. \"They knew Shaundra could protect herself and they didn't want to have to deal with Ichiro. You saw what he did when he entered that club. Our baby is a trained assassin when it comes to martial arts. None of the security is foolish enough to mess with him or Shaundra. Plus their main priority is to watch over my delicate form.\"</p><p>\"You don't need any protecting,\" Cristal replied. \"Not with all those muscles.\"</p><p>\"You'd be surprised,\" Satoshi said as the security allowed Kenshin to continue on into the compound. He stopped the limousine at the front door and everyone got out.</p><p>Kenshin brought in Cristal's luggage while Takumijo and Satoshi escorted her inside.</p><p>\"It is so good to be home,\" Cristal said removing her glasses. She let them lead her into the den. She spotted Ichiro immediately and he was talking to some woman.</p><p>Cristal looked closer. \"Shaundra?\"</p><p>Shaundra and Ichiro looked up.</p><p>Cristal continued into the den. \"It is you?\" She couldn't stop the tears.</p><p>\"Oh, oh, another hormonal woman,\" Ichiro said moving away from the sofa where Shaundra sat.</p><p>\"I thought you were dead.\"</p><p>\"So did everyone, but you know it's not my time yet?\" She pushed the blanket aside and tried to stand.</p><p>Ichiro and Satoshi dashed over to help her.</p><p>Cristal blinked. \"What?\"</p><p>\"Shaundra's pregnant,\" Satoshi answered. \"Surprise!\"</p><p>\"I never saw this coming,\" Cristal said to Shaundra once the men in their lives disappeared from the room.</p><p>\"Me either,\" Shaundra confessed. \"Believe me it wasn't planned.\"</p><p>\"But I thought...\"</p><p>\"I thought so too,\" Shaundra admitted. \"But apparently Ichiro has friends in high places. He said he prayed for a miracle.\"</p><p>\"From the looks of things I would say he did more than pray.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded in agreement. \"Yeah and his prayers were answered with not only one but two little bundles of joy.\"</p><p>\"Twins?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"Yes, hopefully only twins. With my luck we'll probably get quadruplets or something. But so far they are two distinct heartbeats.\"</p><p>\"Why do I have the feeling you're less than excited,\"</p><p>Cristal said settling back in a chair in Shaundra's room and sipping tea.</p><p>\"Because I'll be fifty-one by the time I deliver.\"</p><p>\"But you'll have plenty of help.\"</p><p>\"They say that now but it never really works out that way.</p><p>Ich will be on the road most of the time or at the restaurants and I'll be home pulling my hair out with colicky babies.\"</p><p>\"You can hire a nanny,\" Cristal suggested.</p><p>\"True, but they're going to need me the first couple of months of their lives. And honey, I can barely take care of myself.\"</p><p>Cristal chuckled. \"Stop the jokes. You'll be perfect and you have a husband who adores you.\"</p><p>\"My first husband adored me too, but I can count on my fingers the number of times he got up to help me with the babies. And I don't think my body is going to bounce back this time.\"</p><p>\"So you worried that Ichiro won't find you desirable after the babies are born?\"</p><p>\"Yes, but I don't think he finds me desirable now. I've gained so much weight and it's just six months into the pregnancy.\"</p><p>\"But the weight looks good on you and your skin is glowing.\"</p><p>\"And he's had to hold my hair back while I puke my guts out every morning since I've returned. Real sexy.\"</p><p>Cristal frowned. \"At least you have a man.\"</p><p>\"Last time I checked you had two.\"</p><p>\"Technically one possible and one maybe, but neither thinks enough of me to put me number one in their life. So if I was smart I should give up on both of them,\" Cristal said.</p><p>\"I don't think so, Shaundra said. \"One of them, unfortunately, is Mr. Right.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, which one?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>Shaundra shrugged. \"Only you can decide that.\"</p><p>\"I don't know how you do it, knowing they're all in love with you.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"Well, that's easy because I'm only in love with one of them. The rest are just pretty eye candy who I fantasize about but respect enough not to hurt them.\"</p><p>\"Well put,\" Cristal said. She paused. \"Then why did you leave?\"</p><p>\"Because he deserves better...not that I think I'm the worse woman in the world, but I got the feeling that one day he'll wake up and discover that there are better and younger women out there.\"</p><p>\"So what made you come back?\"</p><p>\"I made the mistake of not leaving Japan as soon as I woke up from a coma.\"</p><p>\"You mean if they hadn't found you, you wouldn't have returned?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded.</p><p>Satoshi pulled Ichiro away from this bedroom door. Who'd thought that the two of them would stoop so low as to eavesdrop on their womenfolk?</p><p>\"She didn't want to come back,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>\"You're missing the point here, Ich. She feels she's doing it for you. She was stepping aside so you could experience the world and not wrap your entire life around her.\"</p><p>\"But she is my life,\" Ichiro said as they entered the music room.</p><p>\"Yes, but she doesn't know that. Do you remember how it was before she left? The two of you weren't even speaking.</p><p>You called her a horrible name and you hadn't slept at home for a week. She didn't even know you were going out of town before we left for China. Put yourself in her shoes. Perhaps she thought you found someone else.\"</p><p>\"But isn't that what she wants?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"Now, but not then. Shaundra's a real classy lady. She told me once that she hoped you'll be man enough to tell her if you found someone else and she said she would step aside and let you go.\" He walked over to the piano and sat down.</p><p>Ichiro followed him over. \"How come you know so much about my wife? How come you know what makes her happy?\"</p><p>Satoshi lifted his eyes. \"Because she trusts me enough to speak what's in her heart.\"</p><p>\"And she doesn't trust me?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>Satoshi shrugged.</p><p>\"One more question. Is it possible that you can be the father of those twins in her oven?\"</p><p>\"Anything is possible, Ich. But the question is how well do you know you wife? Would she cheat with someone who is like a brother to you?\"</p><p>Ichiro sighed. To come out and ask him if he slept with Shaundra would be rude. \"Do you love her?\"</p><p>\"Very much so,\" Satoshi replied as he began to play. \"But I cherish her friendship more.\"</p><p>What did that mean? Still no real reason. How well did he really know Shaundra?</p><p>\"Why don't you just ask her?\"</p><p>\"I couldn't do that,\" Ichiro said. \"That would be rude.\"</p><p>\"Could you take being the father of someone else's kids?\"</p><p>Ichiro sat down next to him on the piano bench. \"I don't know.\" Please God let them be mine.</p><p>\"Three months is a long time to wait.\"</p><p>Damn Satoshi. He would have to throw that part in.</p><p>Takumijo and Yori entered the room to practice a new song Ichiro had written for their new album. Masaaki had gotten them a commercial gig, and in less than a week they would be going to Tokyo to film a music video.</p><p>Ichiro looked over at Yori. Could he be daddy to Yori's twins? Probably after he killed Yori first and he didn't have to be in the picture. He sighed. And he hadn't registered their marriage yet. Once he did, these babies would legally be his.</p><p>Maybe he would just put it off until after they were born.</p><p>\"We're waiting, Ich,\" Takumijo said. \"Where is your mind?\"</p><p>\"Far away,\" Satoshi answered for him.</p><p>\"Is Shaundra still putting on the restraints in the bedroom?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>Satoshi nodded.</p><p>Yori looked at Ichiro and raised a curious eyebrow. \"What you done this time?\"</p><p>\"Nothing,\" Ichiro said quickly. \"Why do you assume I've done something?\"</p><p>\"Because you used to have to beat her off you.\"</p><p>Takumijo and Satoshi laughed.</p><p>\"She's pregnant and probably not in the mood,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>Yori shook his head. \"That's where you're wrong. She's probably more in the mood now than ever with all those raging hormones and growing body parts.\"</p><p>\"More in the mood?\" Ichiro asked. Her sex drive before the pregnancy was already over the charts.</p><p>\"Maybe I need to go upstairs and check on her.\" Yori straightened his tie. He was looking especially kawaii in a dark suit and a white shirt.</p><p>\"You make one move toward those stairs and you're a dead man,\" Satoshi said, shocking both him and Yori. \"She is not a piece of meat.\"</p><p>Satoshi's on the defense, Ichiro thought. Why? More and more it kept looking that maybe Amaya was right. Did his beautiful wife not find him desirable anymore? True, Satoshi was as cute as a baby panda and he was a more experienced lover, but could he be the one she wanted after all these months?</p><p>\"Let's get this practice over with you guys,\" Yori said. \"I'm meeting with the in-laws for dinner but before then, Amaya and I are going to look at drapes.\"</p><p>All three of the others chuckled.</p><p>\"Whipped,\" Takumijo mumbled.</p><p>\"Say what you like, pretty boy but at least I'm getting it regularly.\"</p><p>Ichiro frowned. Amaya had moved the stick out of her butt. To hell with this. Tonight he was taking his wife out on a date. He took out his cell phone and texted her asking her if she felt like going to Kyoto for the weekend. He sent the message. It came back. \"Yes, baby.\" Ichiro put the phone away.</p><p>\"Why are you smiling?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"Because I got a date,\" Ichiro replied.</p><p>The three men looked at him oddly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Takumijo stepped out of the shower and dried off. He was meeting Osamu and some of their friends for drinks at the club and he didn't want to be late. He supposed this would be the last time they would be together for a while because he and Osamu were busy filming their new drama. He'd been in a couple of dramas before and found the work interesting but it would never replace singing. Well, it would if his voice ever gave out.</p><p>Someone knocked on the door. \"Come in.\"</p><p>Satoshi sauntered in and flopped down on his bed. \"Going out?\"</p><p>Takumijo nodded. \"It's been a long week and a couple of my friends and I are going to make the rounds.\"</p> <p>\"Same old Takumijo. When are you going to give up all this partying and settle down?\"</p><p>\"Right before I die,\" Takumijo said pulling on a pair of tight black jeans. He didn't have a problem dressing in front of other guys and besides Satoshi was harmless. \"What's up with you this evening?\"</p><p>\"Nothing,\" Satoshi said. \"I was thinking about calling it an early night since everyone is going out for the evening.\"</p><p>\"Not everyone,\" Takumijo said. \"Why don't you take Cristal out?\"</p><p>Satoshi shook his head. \"She won't go out with me. She's still hung on Yi-jun.\"</p> <p>\"How do you know this? She seemed awfully glad to see you at the airport.\"</p><p>\"And where would I take her on such short notice?\"</p><p>Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"To a movie or out for a stroll somewhere away from the farmhouse.\"</p><p>\"Or I could just stay here and have my way with her,\"</p><p>Satoshi said.</p> <p>\"We're talking Cristal here. Not some club floozy.\"</p><p>\"Floozy? Where are you and Ich learning these words? But I do get the drift.\"</p><p>Takumijo pulled on a sleeveless tee shirt and then a silky black jersey. He added a silver cross with one half of a broken heart and then added a broken heart earring to his left ear, followed by a silver ring.</p><p>\"How is the production of the drama coming?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"Fine,\" Takumijo replied as he added some cologne to his wrists and behind his ears. \"I'm having fun and the cast members are great.\"</p><p>\"That's good,\" Satoshi said. \"But don't enjoy it too much.\"</p><p>\"Don't worry, I'm not leaving Aomori. Despite what everyone thinks, our group comes before anything and everyone.\"</p><p>\"Even Osamu?\" Satoshi asked.</p> <p>Takumijo nodded. \"I'm too selfish to put anyone before me. My life is Aomori and you guys. Acting is a hobby and maybe something to fall back on if I can no longer sing or dance. Now stop stalling and go ask Cristal out.\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded and moved forward toward the door.</p><p>\"What is the worst thing that can happen?\"</p><p>\"She can slam the door in your face.\" Takumijo replied with a chuckle.</p><p>\"Had that happen to me a time or two before.\" Satoshi walked out leaving Takumijo to finish dressing.</p><p>Satoshi walked to his room. A date? Where could he take her that would impress her? A festival? To the movies? To dinner? He reached for the phone and made a couple of inquiries. There were a lot of things going on around Osaka, but he wondered what Cristal would enjoy doing. He picked up the phone and called her. Cristal picked her phone up on one ring.</p><p>\"Hello.\"</p><p>\"Hello beautiful Cristal.\"</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>\"Are you there?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Cristal answered. \"I'm polishing my toes.\"</p><p>\"What color?\" Satoshi asked curiously.</p><p>\"Firehouse red.\"</p><p>Something inside his loins stirred. \"I can't wait to see them on our date tonight.\"</p><p>Sounded like she dropped the phone. \"We have a date? I don't see it on my calendar.\"</p><p>\"Ah, come on. What else do you have to do?\"</p><p>\"Let me see.\" She paused. \"Nothing, but that does not mean I'm available.\"</p><p>\"Don't make me beg,\" Satoshi pleaded. \"I'll let you pick out the place.\"</p><p>Cristal chuckled. \"You must be desperate if you're allowing me to make a decision.\"</p><p>\"Not desperate, but lonely. Suddenly I've discovered that I don't have a life.\"</p><p>\"I know what you mean,\" Cristal replied.</p><p>He knew they had something in common. \"So what do you want to do?\"</p><p>\"I'd like to find out about you,\" Cristal said.</p><p>\"Meaning?\" Satoshi asked intrigued.</p><p>\"I'd like to meet your family.\"</p><p>Satoshi eyes widened. \"Of all the things in the world you could have chose, why this?\"</p><p>\"Because other than the obvious, I've discovered that I know absolutely nothing about you.\"</p><p>\"That's not true,\" Satoshi said. \"You know that I'm charming, cute, have a great sense of humor, and I find you interesting.\"</p><p>Cristal laughed. \"True, but I want to see where you reside, meet your people, and find out what you were like as a child.\"</p><p>He'd never been presented such a request before. \"Hold on a moment. Let me see if my parents are at home.\" He put Cristal on hold and dialed his parents, who were delighted to hear from him and wondered if he was in trouble again. \"No, a friend of mine would like to meet you,\" he told his mother.</p><p>\"A girl friend?\" His father asked over the speakerphone.</p><p>Satoshi hoped they weren't entertaining other dignitaries.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>His mother squealed. \"Bring her. We can have dinner together.\"</p><p>\"See you shortly,\" he told her. He disconnected the call and got back to Cristal. \"They're expecting us,\" he said. \"And wear a dress. My father is a leg man.\"</p><p>\"Hum, now I see where it comes from. I'll be ready in thirty minutes.\"</p><p>\"I'll meet you in the foyer,\" Satoshi said feeling a bit nervous. He'd never brought a girl home to meet his parents before. What did it mean?</p><p>Cristal tore through her closet trying to find something appropriate to wear to meet the ambassador and his wife.</p><p>Pants were definitely out, and she didn't want to be too dressy especially at this late hour. What had she been thinking? Meeting a man's parents was a big step in a relationship.</p><p>Cristal chose an outfit and eased her freshly painted toes into her high-heeled sandals. She decided to wear her shoulder-length hair down. Lucky she had just gone to the hairdresser earlier that day. She walked down the stairs thirty minutes later and found Satoshi waiting.</p><p>\"Oh my God, look at you,\" she teased. He looked simply angelic in a rust-colored double-breasted suit. He wore his hair loose and combed back from his forehead. He had accessorized his outfit with a silver tie tack and rust colored shoes.</p><p>\"I'm too busy looking at you,\" Satoshi replied. He held out his hand to her. \"You are simply gorgeous.\"</p><p>Cristal hoped she had selected correctly. She wore a two- pieced yellow skirt set, accessorized with a white pearl necklace and earrings. She added white sandaled pumps and a matching clutch to complete the look. \"Do I look okay?\" she asked.</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"My folks are going to love you. Come on, let's go.\"</p><p>Cristal nodded and accepted his hand.</p><p>Satoshi's red sports car waited out at the curb. If she wasn't mistaken, it was the first time that the two of them had ever been somewhere together alone without Kenshin, Takumijo, or the bodyguards. \"Where do your parents live?\"</p><p>Cristal asked.</p><p>\"Fine time for you to ask,\" Satoshi said. \"For all you know they might live on the moon.\"</p><p>\"I didn't bring an overnight bag,\" she replied.</p><p>\"No need. They live here in Osaka.\"</p><p>Cristal chucked. \"Are they afraid to cut the apron strings?\"</p><p>\"Yes. I am their baby. They keep me near so I'll keep out of trouble. It's much easier than flying in from the United States to bail me out of jail.\"</p><p>\"I hope you're kidding.\"</p><p>Satoshi just smiled at her but did not answer.</p><p>The little red car had a lot of get up and go, and Satoshi wheeled it like an expert.</p><p>They drove up to what could only be described as a Japanese version of an American mansion. \"Is this your home?\" Cristal asked Satoshi.</p><p>\"No. It's my parents' home. I live with you, remember?\"</p><p>\"You know what I mean,\" Cristal said admiring the stately home. It was white with a slanted red roof, awnings, and window shutters. There was a huge porch and outer buildings.</p><p>It reminded her of a place she'd seen in a magazine once.</p><p>What was it? Oh yes, the Imperial Palace.</p><p>Satoshi turned off the car, got out, and came around to help her out.</p><p>\"Wow,\" Cristal said as they walked past a Japanese fountain filled with tiny bonsai trees and water lilies. \"This is gorgeous.\"</p><p>\"It doesn't take much to impress you, does it?\"</p><p>\"Aw, come on, don't say that. This place is beautiful.\"</p><p>Satoshi shrugged, took her hand, and led her to the front door. He rang the bell.</p><p>Odd, she had a key to her parents place to let herself in and out.</p><p>The door was quickly answered. She expected to see a butler but instead a handsomely dressed older Japanese woman appeared.</p><p>\"Satoshi,\" the woman squealed.</p><p>Satoshi bowed. \"Mother.\"</p><p>The woman had her arms around him before he could straighten up. He towered over her. \"What's with the formal greeting?\" she asked squeezing him tightly. \"I'm still your Mommy.\"</p><p>Satoshi eased her arms from around him. \"Mother, this is Cristal Gentry. Cristal, this is my mother.\"</p><p>Mrs. Hayashi took her attention off her baby and peered over at her. A big smile appeared. \"She's gorgeous,\" she told Satoshi, pushing him aside. She pulled Cristal in her arms and hugged her.</p><p>Cristal looked to Satoshi for help but he just smiled and ignored her.</p><p>Mrs. Hayashi finally released her. \"Here, let me look at you.\" She turned Cristal around slowly. \"Where are you from, my dear?\" she asked as she linked arms with her and led her in.</p><p>\"Los Angeles, California,\" Cristal replied. Satoshi was left to close the door and follow them in.</p><p>\"Your home is so lovely.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\" Mrs. Hayashi said.</p><p>The rest of the mansion was just as magnificent as the outside. They passed through many rooms. Most of them were decorated in typical traditional Japanese style with low tables, rugs, and art on the walls. But some, like the parlor and piano rooms were more American traditional. They finally entered a small cozy dining room with a brown wooden table that could seat eight comfortably. The walls were painted a buttery yellow, and there was brown crown molding around the brown draped windows and the doors. The chairs were upholstered in gold, red, and green brocade. Two men sat at the table. They rose when they entered.</p><p>\"Cristal Gentry, this is my husband, Ambassador Hayashi and my eldest son.\"</p><p>My, my, my, Satoshi is full of surprises. She knew him, what, nearly a year and he never mentioned that he had a handsome older brother.</p><p>\"And this beautiful young woman is Cristal Gentry, a friend of Satoshi.\"</p><p>The older man approached and took her hand. He was dressed in a dark brown business suit and light brown tie. He was very tall. He resembled Satoshi around the eyes and forehead, but Satoshi had inherited his delicate features from his mother. \"It is nice to meet a friend of Satoshi's,\" the ambassador said. He bowed again. \"Welcome to our home, Miss Gentry.\" His chocolate brown eyes, Satoshi's eyes, twinkled merrily. He introduced his eldest son. \"This is Tae.\"</p><p>Cristal turned to face the other man. He also shared those beautiful brown eyes, but he had taken his handsome looks from his father. Unlike Satoshi, his looks were more masculine and refined. He wore a black business suit that fitted his muscular shoulders and rugged build. His straight black hair was fashionably cut short and looked manly.</p><p>\"It is nice to meet you, Miss Gentry,\" Tae said. He too spoke English, but it was more accented than the others. He raised his eyes checking her out.</p><p>Cristal never broke the gaze.</p><p>Tae smirked.</p><p>If he thought she was some empty-headed broad, he was surely mistaken.</p><p>The ambassador took her over to the table and helped her into a seat. He did the same for his wife and then sat down.</p><p>His two grown sons sat down after them. Satoshi sat next to her, while Tae sat across from her. They continued to talk and to get to know each other until the maid entered with the food. The young woman took one looked at Satoshi, blushed, and put her head down. Cristal knew exactly how the young woman felt. Satoshi was just too much to take in at one time.</p><p>\"What do you do for a living?\" Tae asked Cristal.</p><p>\"I'm a journalist and Aomori's publicist,\" Cristal answered.</p><p>Tae lifted his chopsticks. \"Ah, mixing business with pleasure. I see.\"</p><p>\"Not exactly,\" she said knowing exactly what he meant. \"I enjoy my work. It's challenging and not always fun. But there are a few times when you can say it has been pleasurable.\"</p><p>She waited for the elder Hayashis to begin eating before sampling the meal.</p><p>\"How long have you and Satoshi been dating?\" Tae asked.</p><p>\"Ms. Gentry and I are friends,\" Satoshi answered his brother. He picked up his bowl of rice and scooped some into his mouth.</p><p>She might be an outsider but she could tell that there were some problems between the brothers. She supposed it could just be sibling rivalry, but she felt this tension between them.</p><p>The usually talkative Satoshi hadn't said very much since they arrived.</p><p>\"What does a publicist do?\" Mrs. Hayashi asked.</p><p>\"I plan and organize Aomori's public appearances and help schedule events. I take care of their speeches and keep the public abreast of what the group is doing, like appearances and television shows.\"</p><p>\"Isn't it also your job to keep them out of trouble?\" Tae asked.</p><p>The food sank to the pit of her stomach. \"No,\" Cristal replied. \"They are grown men. They can do that for themselves. My job is just to keep it from being publicized.\"</p><p>\"Satoshi must keep you pretty busy,\" he said sarcastically.</p><p>\"Not especially,\" Cristal replied, picking up the fact that he was trying to insult his younger brother. \"I find his zest for life charming.\"</p><p>Mrs. Hayashi chuckled, while the ambassador cleared his throat.</p><p>\"What do your parents do?\" Mrs. Hayashi asked.</p><p>\"Both of my parents have retired from the United States Marine Corps. My father was a general and my mother was a colonel.\"</p><p>\"You're a military brat?\" Tae asked.</p><p>Satoshi glared at him but did not comment.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Cristal replied proudly. \"What do you do for a living?\"</p><p>\"Tae is a corporate lawyer,\" Satoshi answered.</p><p>\"Yes, I work for one of the largest law firms in Osaka. It's not as glamorous as being a pop singer, but I make a decent living.\"</p><p>Cristal knew a slight when she heard one. What was up with him? \"Satoshi is a gifted singer and pianist,\" Cristal said in her friend's defense. \"He's also a talented dancer. And...\"</p><p>\"A troublemaker,\" Tae finished. \"Has he told you how many times he's been arrested?\"</p><p>\"Yes, I know all about that, but it's not like he's murdered anyone. Young men, especially those who are entertainers, tend to be a bit undisciplined because of the rigorous training and sacrifice they make for their craft. Do you have any idea what it's like to be an idol? He can't go anywhere or do things normal people do. I'm surprised we weren't mobbed on the way here. Satoshi and the others have to give up on having normal lives. So if he goes a little wild at times, it's perfectly understandable.\"</p><p>\"Well said, young lady,\" the ambassador said to her. \"You certainly seem to know a lot about my son. And you must be the reason we haven't had to bail him out of jail this past year.\"</p><p>Satoshi smirked.</p><p>\"It's my job to know them,\" Cristal said. \"And they're not very different from any other twenty-year-old men. You don't have to worry about him. He's a fine young man and very responsible. He's the backbone of Aomori.\"</p><p>Satoshi lifted an eyebrow to her.</p><p>\"In what way?\" Tae asked still not convinced that his brother wasn't a criminal.</p><p>\"Everyone goes to him with their problems. He's a very good listener and very compassionate. And he'd do anything for a friend, even introduce him to a good woman.\"</p><p>\"Remind me to tell Masaaki to give you a raise,\" Satoshi replied as he sipped his tea.</p><p>\"See,\" Mrs. Hayashi said. \"He is not a thug.\"</p><p>Cristal chuckled. \"No, not a thug. He's a dear friend.\"</p><p>Satoshi winked at her and went back to his meal.</p><p>Shaundra and Ichiro arrived at his restaurant in Osaka around six, and found the parking lot jammed packed with patrons. Ichiro parked in his personal spot and then came around to help her out of the car.</p><p>\"I can't wait to introduce you to my family,\" he said excitedly.</p><p>Shaundra sighed. How was she going to make a good first impression pregnant and looking like she had a watermelon stuffed beneath the red-and-white maternity outfit Harper had purchased for her? It had gotten to the point that she could barely balance herself on heels, and her breasts were getting so big they literally spilled over the neckline of her blouse.</p><p>Ichiro helped her up the stairs, being very careful not to jostle her. So much attention smothered her but she didn't mention it because his feelings were still too fragile.</p><p>Ichiro opened the door and they stepped inside.</p><p>Shaundra's eyes widened. The restaurant looked a lot different now than it had when he first showed it to her right after they met. She expected it to be done in traditional Japanese fashion with pillows on the floors, but no, it was very modern with tables and booths and romantic lighting.</p><p>Delicious aromas filtered out from the kitchen and from the tabletop hibachis. The babies moved around in her stomach as if anxious to sample each and every dish. Sometimes she wondered if she actually carried babies inside of her. She was always hungry now, even though most of it came back up right after she ate it. Hopefully that would not happen tonight.</p><p>A young, pretty Japanese woman came toward them. She had long shoulder-length black hair and she wore a yellow kimono. \"Ichiro,\" she squealed and hugged him.</p><p>\"Down brat,\" Ichiro told her. \"You act like you've never seen me before.\"</p><p>The young woman chuckled and then peered over at her.</p><p>\"Shaundra?\"</p><p>Who else? Shaundra wondered.</p><p>\"Who else,\" Ichiro replied as if reading her mind. He took her hand and tugged her forward. \"Shaundra, this is my sister Etsuko. Etsuko, this is my wife, Shaundra.\"</p><p>\"Konnichiwa,\" Etsuko said in Japanese.</p><p>\"Konnichiwa,\" Shaundra repeated. At least she knew enough of the language to recognize the warm and friendly greeting.</p><p>\"You are very beautiful,\" Etsuko said in English. \"Welcome to our family.\" She bowed respectfully.</p><p>Shaundra bowed back even though she couldn't bend down as low as the younger woman.</p><p>\"Come and meet the others,\" Etsuko said taking Shaundra's hand and leading her further into the restaurant past the other diners. \"I have read some of your books. I like the ones you have published here in Japan.\"</p><p>She spoke English a lot better than Shaundra imagined.</p><p>She hadn't published any contemporary romances in Japan so she meant the yaoi or gay novels. \"You like yaoi?\"</p><p>Etsuko nodded. \"What's not to like about two handsome men and a lot of romantic action?\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. This one she liked. Etsuko and Ichiro resembled each other around the eyes and mouth but Etsuko's eyes were a deep chocolate brown instead of blue.</p><p>She pulled another young woman away from a counter.</p><p>\"Hana,\" this is Ichiro's wife, Shaundra. Shaundra this is my older sister Hana.\" The young woman whom Hana was talking to once they arrived, looked her over, bowed, and then left.</p><p>But not before Shaundra noticed the smile she gave Ichiro.</p><p>Ichiro's other sister was gorgeous and slender with short brown hair and brown eyes. She wore a classy black skirt set with an emblem of a dragon on the pocket. She bowed first and then hugged Shaundra.</p><p>\"It is very nice to finally meet you.\" She broke the embrace, stepped back, and looked at Shaundra. \"The pregnancy agrees with you. Your skin is glowing. No wonder my brother has been floating on a cloud since he married you.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\" Shaundra said. She never expected such warmth and love.</p><p>\"Where's Daichi?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"He's in the kitchen,\" Hana answered. \"I will get him.\" She left and then returned a few minutes later accompanied by a man dressed in a brown suit, with short black hair and baring a striking resemblance to Ichiro. Hana introduced him.</p><p>\"Konnichiwa,\" he said to Shaundra in Japanese. He bowed.</p><p>\"Konnichiwa,\" Shaundra repeated. There was no denying the resemblance. Daichi was gorgeous.</p><p>\"Ichiro is a very lucky man,\" he said taking her arm and leading her up the hall.</p><p>Ichiro just shrugged and followed. They entered a private dining room. Shaundra's eyes landed on a loving family portrait of the four siblings and felt a pang of jealousy.</p><p>\"The chefs have prepared a wonderful meal for you,\"</p><p>Daichi told her. \"No salt and light on the seasonings.\"</p><p>He helped her into a seat. \"Thank you,\" she said. So Ich had filled him in on her condition. She supposed she should be thankful. He sat down next to her for a few minutes while Ichiro sat across from them. The two sisters left and went back to work.</p><p>\"Ichiro should have brought you around sooner,\" Daichi said.</p><p>\"I went missing for a couple of months,\" Shaundra said trying to make light of the situation.</p><p>\"No, before the earthquake. You've been married for quite a while now and he knows we've been dying to meet you.\"</p><p>\"I've been busy,\" Ichiro said in his own defense. \"She's here now; can't you be happy with that?\"</p><p>\"I'm very happy with this,\" Daichi said. \"She is now the matriarch of the family and there is so much for her to learn.\"</p><p>Matriarch. Why did that make her seem like an ancient relic? \"What do I have to learn?\"</p><p>\"Family traditions and history, and there are many relatives to meet. They are all anxious to get to know you.\"</p><p>Shaundra scowled. Ichiro hadn't mentioned any of this.</p><p>\"When are the babies due?\"</p><p>\"In October,\" Shaundra said.</p><p>\"What? That only gives us a few months to prepare.\"</p><p>\"Prepare for what?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"For the formal christening,\" Daichi told her. \"There will be an elaborate ceremony to welcome you and them into the Yoshida family. And then there's the formal registering of their birth.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked over at Ichiro. He looked terribly guilty about something. \"It all sounds so exciting,\" Shaundra lied.</p><p>She'd only come there for a meal, and now she had to put aside most of her plans to prepare for a christening.</p><p>\"She's supposed to be on bed rest,\" Ichiro finally said.</p><p>\"She can't participate in much of the celebration. She's very delicate.\"</p><p>\"I understand,\" Daichi said. \"And we will take every precaution.\"</p><p>They made it sound like she was about to be crowned queen of Japan or something. Wait, no, empress. She had to get her female monarchies straight.</p><p>The door opened and two waiters appeared with their meal.</p><p>\"I have to get back to work,\" Daichi said rising. \"Please enjoy the meal.\" He lifted Shaundra's hand and kissed it.</p><p>Their eyes met and Shaundra's widened by what she saw in his. \"Ichiro is a very lucky man.\"</p><p>Shaundra also caught the look of surprise on Ichiro's face as his brother released her hand and left the room. Is he jealous? Good!</p><p>The waiters left, leaving her alone with Ichiro. He moved over to the seat Daichi vacated. \"My brother seems much taken with you,\" he said as he tested the food before serving it to her. She knew he did it to check for salt and MSG.</p><p>\"He is just being nice,\" Shaundra said, not taking her eyes off him.</p><p>\"He's never been this nice before,\" Ichiro said as he dished up their food.</p><p>\"Are you jealous?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>Ichiro lifted those exquisite eyes to her and her pussy watered. \"Yes, my brother is quite handsome.\"</p><p>\"Yes, he is,\" Shaundra replied. \"But not as handsome as you, baby.\"</p><p>Heat blistered in those sapphire eyes.</p><p>Shaundra gulped. He desperately wanted her. Maybe she had strung him along sexually long enough.</p><p>\"I want to make the night special,\" he told her. \"Let's start our lives over again.\"</p><p>She was down for that at the moment. But even she knew that they could not go back to the way things were. Too much time had passed, and she had put into her mind to just take this one day at a time until she made a decision to stay or leave.</p><p>The club was jumping with young people dancing uninhibited to music played by a disc jockey. Takumijo had met up with Osamu and some of the other cast members and were seated at a table by themselves drinking Tequila and discussing their parts.</p><p>Tomorrow's script called for him and Osamu to enter a burning building. They'd also be doing some high-flying martial art movements, and there was a romantic love scene in which he was supposed to participate.</p><p>\"Where is the rest of your group?\" Osamu asked him as they did a couple of gelatin shots.</p><p>\"Yori is visiting his in-laws, Satoshi is out on a date with our publicist and Ichiro and his wife have gone away from the weekend.\"</p><p>Osamu chuckled. \"Ichiro with a wife. I can't even imagine that.\"</p><p>Takumijo shook his head. \"I couldn't either at first, but he is a loving husband and will make a great father.\"</p><p>\"They're expecting?\" Osamu asked.</p><p>Takumijo nodded. \"She's six months pregnant.\"</p><p>\"She is very pretty for an older woman.\"</p><p>\"I suppose,\" Takumijo replied. \"She is just what Ichiro needs.\"</p><p>\"At the moment,\" Osamu said. \"But you and I know better than that.\"</p><p>Takumijo looked over at his friend. \"I don't understand what you mean.\"</p><p>\"Ichiro is quite attractive. Sooner or later someone else might catch his eye and bring him over to the dark side.\"</p><p>Takumijo chuckled. \"I doubt that. Ichiro is very much into women.\"</p><p>\"How do you know this?\" Osamu asked, raising his glass for a toast.</p><p>Takumijo saluted back with his drink. \"I just know. There's no way he'd fall for a man, despite his looks. Ich is into breasts, not dicks.\"</p><p>\"Speaking of dicks, did you say that Satoshi is out on a date with Ms. Gentry? I thought she was Yi-jun's woman.\"</p><p>\"Yi-jun is a very busy actor. He is filming in the United States at the moment and doesn't have time for Cristal.\"</p><p>\"So Satoshi is moving in on Yi-jun's territory?\"</p><p>\"No, she does not belong to Yi-jun. Cristal is the woman of Satoshi's dreams. He is just too stupid to realize it.\" He chuckled. \"I'd guess he's feeling very confused right about now. She's probably stringing him along and making him pay for fixing her up with Yi-jun. I still don't understand why he did that. I noticed the chemistry between them the moment they met.\"</p><p>Osamu laughed. \"That's funny because I felt the same thing between him and Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"Well, that's true, but Ichiro is our maknae and would kick Satoshi's ass if he made a play for him.\"</p><p>\"And what about you?\"</p><p>\"What about me?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Would he kick your ass too?\"</p><p>\"Probably not, since I'm so irresistible and charming.\"</p><p>A young woman approached. \"May I have this dance?\" she asked Takumijo.</p><p>He looked down at her. She had the cutest eyes and the sweetest smile, and Osamu's questions were starting to make him nervous. \"Sure,\" he said. \"See,\" he told Osamu. \"No one can resist me.\" He winked and followed the young woman onto the dance floor.</p><p>Your family is certainly interesting,\" Cristal said to Satoshi as they drove back to the farmhouse.</p><p>He peered over at her. \"And you made quite an impression on them, but unfortunately now they expect me to act like a gentleman and stay out of trouble.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong with that?\" Cristal asked settling back in her seat.</p><p>\"It's so boring,\" Satoshi said. \"What's life without a little adventure?\"</p><p>\"My life,\" Cristal replied with a sigh. All a part of being an upstanding citizen in society.\"</p><p>\"Tae likes you.\"</p><p>Cristal shook her head. \"Good for him and before you try to fix me up with him, I'm not interested.\"</p><p>Satoshi smirked. \"Now why would I do something like that?\"</p><p>Cristal rolled her eyes at him. \"You are so full of yourself.\"</p><p>\"So, did you have a nice time on our date?\"</p><p>\"Yes, a real nice time. I especially liked the stories your father told me about you as a child. I can't believe you were that innocent. Where did all the sweetness go to?\"</p><p>\"No, I'm not that same little boy, but I'm still sweet, you just haven't sampled it yet.\" He paused. \"I've grown up a lot since returning from the United States.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I can tell, and they're right. You haven't been in jail not since we've met.\"</p><p>He laughed. \"That has nothing to do with you. Jail is not what it's cracked up to be. They throw you in with hardened criminals. Some of them who haven't seen a woman in a long time.\"</p><p>Cristal laughed. \"I can see where that might pose a problem for you guys.\"</p><p>\"Don't let these pretty looks fool you. Beneath this perfect exterior beats the lust of a man.\"</p><p>\"I will take that into consideration if the need ever arise,\"</p><p>Cristal told him.</p><p>Satoshi shook his head. \"You are quite the character, Cristal. Now I see why Yi-jun is in love with you.\"</p><p>\"Yi-jun is not in love with me. Yi-jun is in lust with me.</p><p>Kind of like you guys are with Shaundra.\"</p><p>\"What's the difference?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"Love is what Shaundra and Ichiro have. He puts her first most of the time, and he worships the ground she walks on.</p><p>Shaundra will sacrifice her happiness with him just so he can be happy. That, my friend, is what love is all about.\"</p><p>Satoshi sat quiet for a moment. \"Do you really think so?\"</p><p>\"But of course. The two of them may have their share of problems but they are very much in love with each other. I can see it in their eyes when they look at each other and I can't wait until the babies are born.\"</p><p>\"Why? You don't seem like the motherly type.\"</p><p>\"Are you crazy? Babies are cute and they smell good and what do you mean I'm not the motherly type? I am so the motherly type.\"</p><p>\"Would you like to have a baby?\"</p><p>\"One of these days,\" Cristal said. \"If I can find the right man.\"</p><p>Satoshi drove onto the compound, got the good-to-go from the guard and drove up to the farmhouse. He got out and helped Cristal out and they walked up the stairs together.</p><p>\"It's been fun,\" Cristal said as they entered the house.</p><p>\"It doesn't have to end,\" Satoshi said taking her hand and leading her up the stairs toward the bedrooms.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\"</p><p>\"We can get a jump start on making that baby,\" he told her.</p><p>Cristal froze. Was he saying what she thought he was saying? \"What?\"</p><p>Satoshi pulled her to him and looked deeply into her eyes.</p><p>\"Let me make love to you, Cristal.\"</p><p>The night might have turned out differently if her cell phone hadn't gone off. She pulled it out of her pocket while he continued to stare into her eyes. \"Hello.\"</p><p>\"Hi Cristal, this is Yi-jun.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The room was perfect, set against the backdrop of the sea, with a full moon shining in through the window. Soft American love songs played through the speaker of the stereo. The room was a suite with every amenity known to man and now they sat on a sofa toasting each other with iced glasses of oolong tea. Ichiro had given up on sake after she had returned and he promised he wouldn't drink another drop until his kids were born and only then to celebrate.</p><p>Ichiro pulled his blushing bride to her feet and danced her around the spacious living room and into the bedroom. They hadn't danced this way since their wedding reception, and Shaundra felt good in his arms. \"I've been dreaming of this night a very long time,\" he told her. He kissed her and Shaundra kissed him back. He danced her over to the bed.</p><p>Shaundra sat down to rest.</p><p>\"Have I told you lately just how much I love you,\" he sung to her.</p> <p>\"Every day, baby,\" she replied. \"But they're just words.\"</p><p>Ichiro got down on his knees and bowed before her. \"I am so sorry for everything I've done and I apologize for calling you that nasty name. It was rude and so untrue.\" He looked up at her and found her watching him intently. He never knew what she was thinking anymore. Her brown eyes sparkled with uncertainty and confusion.</p><p>\"I forgive you, Ich,\" she finally said.</p><p>But there was something in her eyes that told him she was lying. He knew he'd hurt her and parts of him wasn't sure he could handle it if the babies weren't his, but he was willing to give it his best shot. He rose and sat down next to her.</p><p>\"I need for you to let me love you,\" he said.</p> <p>Shaundra sat by watching as he began to undress her, exposing those melon-sized breasts. In a couple of months they would be full with milk and his babies would feed from them, but tonight they were his.</p><p>Ichiro pushed her back on the bed gently and ran his hand across her chest. The nipples darkened and budded beneath his touch. \"I hope this means you want me as much as I want you?\"</p><p>Shaundra did not answer. She just blushed lightly and then smiled.</p><p>Ichiro rose from the bed and stripped out of his clothes.</p><p>Shaundra just kept her emotions hidden as she watched. A long time ago she would have stripped him herself before they were in the bedroom. He sighed. He didn't think he would miss her aggressiveness. Shaundra ran her tongue over her bottom lips as he removed his briefs and stood before him. He saw her eyes do this freaky little sultry number where they lightened and then smoldered. He'd only been joking with Satoshi and Takumijo about her being possessed but now he wasn't sure. She stared mesmerized by his thick erection. Then she gave him a smile that had cougar written all over it. His dick hardened even more. \"This is what you do to me,\" he told her. She smirked and Ichiro melted. If she didn't stop looking at him like that he was going to come.</p><p>\"Sit down, jail bait,\" she told him.</p> <p>Ichiro quickly sat down on the bed.</p><p>Shaundra rose and for a moment she seemed like her old self. She slowly began moving her hips to the music. And she rolled her stomach like she wasn't pregnant, totally captivating him as she eased out of the rest of her clothes.</p><p>His eyes followed those hips as they spoke to him. His body tingled with excitement. Shaundra was serenading him with her sensuality, and she had his nose wide open and knew it.</p><p>The red panties she wore finally disappeared, and she stood before him. His eyes lowered. Brazilian waxed? Damn he was in trouble now. She had to be the sexiest pregnant woman in the world. He didn't know if it was safe for them to attempt intercourse since Shaundra was entering her seventh month of pregnancy, but he would just pray for his kids' safety, because he was going in. She walked over to the edge of the bed and he wrapped his arms around her waist and buried his face into her abdomen. \"Forgive me,\" he told the babies. \"But daddy needs loving.\" He lifted her from the floor and put her on her back. Shaundra still stared at him aloofly. \"I am going to make love to you,\" he said using his manly voice. He raised her legs and moved between them. \"I am going to make this a night we both remember.\"</p><p>He went down on his knees and buried his face into her slit before Shaundra could protest. Shaundra smelled and tasted like everything good in the world. He pulled her down closer to the edge of the bed. Her skin felt so warm and inviting and he wanted her so damn badly.</p><p>Shaundra moaned sexily above him, obviously enjoying what he was doing to her. A year ago he would have been afraid to attempt such a daring act but with Shaundra oral sex seemed so natural. His efforts were rewarded by his bride trembling erotically on the mattress above him and drenching him with her juices. Damn, she is ready.</p><p>Ichiro rose, trying to figure out his next move. He moved onto the bed and stared down at his wife. She looked up at him with those cougar eyes and he gulped. She was about to take the decision out of his hands. She pushed him onto his back and mounted him.</p><p>\"Ah!\" he gasped as she sank down on his swollen member.</p> <p>His hands automatically went up to her hips to control her movement. She had a lot more hips, more ass, and more everything and she had everything moving slowly and steadily until he bit his bottom lip to keep from shouting to the world how good it felt. He steadied her roll, knowing how much damage she could cause once she got aroused. His baby wasn't shy about taking the lead and getting what she needed from him. But apparently she wasn't in the mood for anything but slow easy loving. Ichiro breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>Ichiro moved his hands up to her breasts, gently squeezing the nipples until they budded again. One hand slid down her sternum until it reached her abdomen. The babies responded to his touch.</p><p>\"They're okay,\" Shaundra told him as she slowly rode him.</p><p>\"They're protected.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure,\" he asked. He could not live with himself if he'd caused them pain.</p><p>\"Very,\" she told him.</p><p>\"That's all I need to know.\" Ichiro rolled his wife off him and placed her on her back. \"Every now and then I like to be in control,\" he said, sliding his hand up one of her thighs.</p><p>Shaundra chuckled in her deep sultry voice. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Show me what you got.\"</p><p>Ichiro crawled between her thighs, positioned her legs on his hips and entered her again.</p><p>Shaundra gasped and shuddered. \"Oh shit.\"</p><p>Ichiro pulled her down, impaling her. Heat washed all over him as she came again from just a couple of his thrusts. He feared he'd never grow tired of seeing the look on her face as she came. Her feminine juices soaked him and mixed with the sweat they'd worked up. He slid out a little and then eased back in. He didn't think there was any better sensation in the world than ecstasy.</p><p>Shaundra rotated her hips and tried to suck him in deeper.</p><p>She didn't need to make the effort because he didn't plan to leave her warm nest until the wee hours of the morning.</p><p>\"I want you on your knees,\" he told her, turning her over slowly and carefully. \"Your ass looks phenomenal.\" He mounted her from behind, careful not to put too much of his weight on her. In this position he could really get deep and make it enjoyable for both of them. His knees trembled as he moved in and out of her. Shaundra balanced on her elbows and knees, rocking back to meet him as he moved deeper.</p><p>She used her Kegel muscles to tighten her pussy around him.</p><p>She had that move down to a science.</p><p>The heat still emitting from her proved too much for him.</p><p>\"I am going to blow,\" he said as his hips moved faster. He grabbed both sides of her hips and moved her back and forth quickly.</p><p>\"Ooh, me too,\" Shaundra told him as her body shook.</p><p>Sweat ran down his face as his cum left his body. It had built up for a long time that he didn't think it would stop erupting. \"Ah!\" he cried out as his body jerked. Each spurt felt like a ton of weight lifted from his loins. Finally it stopped and he slid off Shaundra, panting hard. Shaundra cuddled up in his arm.</p><p>\"I'm whipped,\" she said as she laid her head against his chest.</p><p>Ichiro kissed her on the head. \"Go to sleep, wifey. I'll wake you if I get all lusty again.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled wearily. \"Yeah, you do that.\"</p><p>Satoshi sat in the music room tying to put music to Ichiro's lyrics. Takumijo had returned and sat across from him trying to recover from a night of partying.</p><p>\"You struck out didn't you?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>Satoshi took his fingers off the keys. \"I made it to third base and was about to slide into home when Yi-jun telephoned Cristal.\"</p><p>\"Bummer,\" Takumijo said yawning. \"Well, maybe the time wasn't right.\"</p><p>\"I'm beginning to think that I am cursed,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>\"Even Jae likes her.\"</p><p>Takumijo suddenly sat forward. \"She met Jae?\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"Yes. I took her home to meet the family.\"</p><p>\"What? That's a pretty big step in a relationship. What the hell did you do that for?\"</p><p>\"Because she wanted to meet them. What else could I do?\"</p><p>\"And they liked her?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Yes, especially my mother. I think the two of them are going shopping next week.\"</p><p>\"And she didn't even sleep with you after all that? You poor pathetic bastard. You are cursed...by stupidity.\" He rose.</p><p>\"I hope Ichiro is having better luck than you.\"</p><p>\"I doubt it,\" Satoshi said. \"Shaundra's not finished making him pay for calling her a whore.\"</p><p>\"Then why did she agree to go out of town with him this weekend?\"</p><p>\"They're not home?\" Satoshi asked. \"I thought they were just going out on a date.\"</p><p>\"He took her to meet his family finally and then he had reservations at this swanky hotel in Kyoto.\"</p><p>Now why did that just piss him the hell off? \"I was wondering when he was going to take her to meet the family.</p><p>I wonder why he waited so long.\"</p><p>Takumijo shrugged. \"You know Ichiro only dances to his own music. He must have had his reason.\"</p><p>\"I suppose,\" Satoshi said. \"So how was your evening out with Osamu?\"</p><p>\"Fun. I danced with this really cute chick.\"</p><p>Satoshi raised an eyebrow. \"You?\" He whistled. \"She must be something special if you still remember her.\"</p><p>\"Her name is Ametersa. That means, shining over heaven.</p><p>She's a backup dancer.\"</p><p>\"A dancer? And you remember her name?\" He pinched himself. He must be dreaming. Not Takumijo. Half the time he couldn't remember his own name after a night out with Osamu.</p><p>\"Got the digits too.\"</p><p>\"For what?\"</p><p>\"Just in case,\" Takumijo said. He strolled out of the music room.</p><p>\"What? For hell to freeze over?\" He went back to the song wondering if Cristal was asleep yet. No, he didn't want any rebound sex. He would just take it easy until he was sure Cristal worked Yi-jun out of her system. Besides, Yi-Jun would be in the United States for another few months and everyone knew that long-distance relationships never worked.</p><p>Satoshi yawned and looked over at the clock. It was three in the morning. He sighed. Ichiro and Shaundra were probably sleeping too. He frowned. How come Takumijo knows about Ichiro's plans and I don't? Probably because Ichiro still suspected him of being the father of his babies. He smirked, guessing anything was possible.</p><p>Satoshi rolled the piano cover down over the keys and rose. He supposed that everything would look bright and cheery after he'd gotten a couple of hours of sleep. He left the music room and walked down the hall enjoying the peace and quiet. In a couple of months it all would be disturbed by the sound of two newborn babies wanting to be fed or changed.</p><p>He walked up the stairs and down the hall toward his room. He heard someone crying. Satoshi turned. It came from Cristal's room. He was just about to knock but changed his mind. Sometimes people just had to work problems out for themselves. He turned and continued to his room.</p><p>The view of the ocean was breathtaking at sunrise.</p><p>Shaundra sat on a beach chair on the patio outside the room watching it happen. Ichiro was still sound asleep, obviously euphoric from sex. He'd probably be out a couple more hours giving her time to write. She owed a new book to her New York publisher but this time she decided to do something different. She was tired of writing about the same old thing and wanted to do something deep and meaningful. The rising sun inspired her.</p><p>Shaundra thought about a premise because a story wasn't anything without one. She wasn't one for outlining but in this case outlining would help keep her focused. She wanted to set the book in a faraway place, which meant a ton of research. She hadn't decided on a country but she knew the United States was out. Why not set it in Japan? A little voice said to her. Technically she thought she could do it, and maybe she'd learn more of the language. And Ichiro could help her with the customs and food references if she was still in town. Well, she knew she would be there until the babies were born and she got past the christening celebration.</p><p>Damn, she thought. She was just digging herself in deeper.</p><p>Maybe meeting Ich's family hadn't been a good idea.</p><p>She sighed, thinking about the christening. She supposed it involved some type of religious ritual, and she hoped she wouldn't get struck by lightning when she entered the church since she hadn't been inside one since her wedding. The ink formed into words and spread across the lines of her legal tablet as she world built.</p><p>\"What are you doing out of bed?\"</p><p>Shaundra turned. Ichiro stood in the patio door clad only in a pair of dove gray drawstring athletic pants. Her gaze ran across his finely chiseled abs and muscular chest. Her fingers continued to move the pen as she described him on paper. He wasn't typical leading man material but she wasn't writing the typical romance.</p><p>He ran his fingers through his hair.</p><p>Shaundra gulped. \"I couldn't sleep,\" she finally said. \"My stomach wouldn't stop wiggling.\"</p><p>Ichiro came out to join her.</p><p>She got a whiff of him. He smelled delicious, like he'd just stepped out of a shower.</p><p>\"Maybe they wanted to witness this beautiful sunrise.\" He inhaled, which made his chest expand. \"The smell of the sea reminds me of happier times when my father used to take me fishing.\"</p><p>Shaundra tried to pay attention. Ichiro didn't speak much about his parents who died a long time ago in a boating accident. Daichi took on the adult roll after that, refusing to allow the siblings to be separated so he went to work to support them. \"I didn't know you liked to fish.\"</p><p>\"I don't,\" Ichiro replied. \"But I did like spending time with my father. He called me his golden child because of my eyes.</p><p>He said I inherited them from Japanese royalty.\"</p><p>\"He sounded like a wise man. What was your mother like?\"</p><p>\"I barely remember her. But she liked to cook.\"</p><p>\"Like you?\"</p><p>\"Yes, I suppose. But my grandmother helped raised me and taught me a lot about cooking and tea ceremonies.\"</p><p>She had heard about that but never actually seen him perform one. She hadn't seen him in a kimono either, which meant he wasn't being true to himself and trying to man up for her.</p><p>\"I want to be a big part in our children's lives,\" he said. \"I want to take them fishing.\"</p><p>\"But you don't like to fish,\" Shaundra reminded him.</p><p>\"It has nothing to do with fishing. It's all about spending time with them. Boys should learn how to fish.\"</p><p>\"And girls?\"</p><p>\"You're carrying boys,\" Ichiro said sounding like a member of the arrogant Aomori. \"They will carry on the Yoshida name.\" He chuckled. \"Next time you'll have girls.\"</p><p>Shaundra groaned, lucky Ichiro could not see the look on her face or read her mind. There wasn't going to be a next time if she could help it. Six children were enough for any sane person.</p><p>He changed the subject. \"I can't wait to build our new home. I want Japanese traditional but with a modern kitchen.</p><p>Of course you will need space for your office and we need a music room for me. The nursery will have to be close by so we can hear the babies when they cry.\"</p><p>Look at my baby making plans. When the hell did he grow up and become so manly? He sounded like he was making plans for the very near future. \"Have you found the property yet?\"</p><p>\"Not yet,\" Ichiro replied. \"You do remember that I talked to you about moving here?\"</p><p>\"Yes.\" Some things she still remembered. \"You also talked about building it near your new restaurant, near the ocean.\"</p><p>\"It will be a nice place to retire.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"That's about ten years away from some of us.\"</p><p>\"I will still love you when you're one hundred,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>\"Sekai.\"</p><p>\"I thought the word was saranghae?\"</p><p>Ichiro chuckled now. The sound made her all wet between the legs. \"That's Korean.\"</p><p>\"What's the difference?\" Shaundra asked, knowing it was Korean but like messing with him.</p><p>\"Okay, saranghae it is.\"</p><p>\"Sekai,\" Shaundra said to him. \"See, I just learned a new word.\"</p><p>Ichiro turned to face her. \"Are you writing another yaoi book?\"</p><p>\"No, I've decided to try something different this time. Kind of a multicultural romance.\"</p><p>\"I read one of your books. The one with the two men.\"</p><p>\"Grossed out much?\"</p><p>\"No,\" he admitted. \"I found it tastefully done, but can't imagine how you know what two men do together.\"</p><p>\"It's not much different then when a man and woman couple,\" Shaundra explained. \"Just an extra penis.\"</p><p>Ichiro sighed. \"I suppose you're right.\" He headed back toward the door. \"Would you like me to get breakfast?\"</p><p>\"Not at the moment. I was thinking about crawling back into bed.\"</p><p>\"You're sleepy?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"No, horny,\" Shaundra answered.</p><p>The look on his face was priceless. \"Oh, the babies need feeding. Come on, I think I can whip them up a quick meal.\"</p><p>He helped her out of the patio chair.</p><p>\"You will let me lead, won't you?\"</p><p>\"I'll think about it,\" Shaundra said. Right now she just couldn't get the picture of his six-pack abs and all that hair out of her mind.</p><p>\"You look like hell,\" Amaya said to Cristal. \"Your eyes are all swollen like you've been crying all night. No wonder Yi-jun ran away to the United States.\"</p><p>\"Yori, so help me if you don't move her out of my sight I am going to pull every hair out of her head,\" Cristal told Aomori's dashing leader.</p><p>\"Warning noted,\" Yori said moving his wife away from Cristal and plopping her down in a seat at the table. \"But your eyes are swollen. Did one of these losers do something to upset you?\"</p><p>\"Who are you calling a loser, pretty boy?\" Takumijo asked as they sat around the table eating breakfast.</p><p>\"You,\" Yori said. \"And Satoshi.\"</p><p>Satoshi raised his head. \"No, I'm afraid we aren't guilty this time.\"</p><p>\"Well I know I'm not,\" Takumijo said. \"I would never make Cristal cry, except in ecstasy.\"</p><p>Cristal chuckled. \"You are ridiculous.\"</p><p>\"And delusional,\" Satoshi added. \"Cristal would never take you to her bed.\"</p><p>Cristal looked over at Takumijo. \"I might. He's kind of fine.\"</p><p>Satoshi lowered his glasses and snarled at her. \"Why, because Yi-jun broke your heart?\"</p><p>\"Don't mention his name,\" Cristal said. \"He is such a creep.\"</p><p>\"The sentence is music to my ears,\" Satoshi said. \"What did the big lug do?\"</p><p>\"He's thinking about permanently moving to the United States.\"</p><p>\"Oh, that would mean you wouldn't get to see him that much,\" Satoshi said happily.</p><p>\"Try ever,\" Cristal said. \"Unless I visit my parents or he flies here.\"</p><p>\"Sound like he dumped your ass,\" Amaya said from her seat on the other side of Yori. \"He's probably living it up with some little blonde starlet.\"</p><p>Cristal rolled her eyes at Amaya.</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"My money is on Cristal.\"</p><p>\"Where are the parents to be?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"Kyoto,\" Takumijo replied. \"They went on a weekend date.\"</p><p>\"What? I thought he was just taking her out to dinner.\"</p><p>\"Same thing I thought,\" Satoshi said. \"I had no idea he'd planned a romantic weekend. He must be desperate.\"</p><p>\"No horny,\" Takumijo explained. \"He planned to charm her panties off.\"</p><p>\"Urg,\" Amaya said. \"She's pregnant.\"</p><p>\"And hot,\" both Satoshi and Yori said simultaneously.</p><p>\"Do you two rehearse your timing?\" Cristal asked them.</p><p>Both Yori and Satoshi shrugged at the same time.</p><p>\"Well I'm proud of Ichiro for taking the initiative,\" Cristal said. \"He's bound and determined to win back Shaundra's love.\"</p><p>\"When did he lose it?\" Yori asked as he sipped his tea.</p><p>\"Why are you worrying about that?\" Amaya asked. \"You should be worried about my love.\"</p><p>Cristal chuckled. The look on Yori's face was priceless. Ah, young love was wonderful. \"Why did he have to take her all the way to Kyoto?\"</p><p>\"That's where Ich is building his new restaurant and where he took Shaundra when we first returned to Osaka from Korea, before the hurricane. It has sentimental meaning to him,\" Takumijo explained.</p><p>\"He took her to meet his family too,\" Satoshi said. \"I'm sure they have all fallen in love with her.\"</p><p>\"I just wonder why he took so long to do it,\" Yori said.</p><p>\"Would you take her home to meet your parents?\" Amaya asked. \"Hell, she's old enough to be your parent.\" She laughed at her own joke.</p><p>Yori frowned at her. \"I thought we had this discussion before. If you can't say anything nice about a person, don't say anything at all.\"</p><p>Fat chance of that happening, Cristal thought.</p><p>\"I am a grown woman, Yori, and I can say what I want.\"</p><p>Ooh, Cristal mused. Drama.</p><p>\"Remember that the next time the two of you get into a bar fight. I won't interfere this time,\" Yori threatened.</p><p>\"There wouldn't have been a fight if you hadn't danced with her,\" Amaya argued back.</p><p>Both Satoshi and Takumijo laughed.</p><p>\"She's fat and pregnant now. I can take her.\"</p><p>\"Don't put any money on that,\" Cristal replied. \"She's still pretty feisty.\"</p><p>Satoshi sighed. \"She probably has poor Ichiro in tears by now.\"</p><p>\"I should be so lucky,\" Yori mumbled.</p><p>\"Can't you two losers think about anything else?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"How was your date with Osamu?\" Amaya asked Takumijo, ignoring Yori. \"He's so fine.\"</p><p>Yori didn't seem a bit upset by that comment.</p><p>\"I'll remember to tell him the next time I see him,\"</p><p>Takumijo said.</p><p>\"You do that. Tell him to put me in his next drama.\"</p><p>\"Since when did you want to be an actress?\" Yori asked her.</p><p>\"Since I was a girl. But my mother talked me into becoming a designer. I like that too but I still want to make a drama.\"</p><p>\"I'll tell him that too,\" Takumijo said. \"There might be a walk-in part for you in this drama.\"</p><p>\"That's why you're my favorite,\" Amaya said to him.</p><p>Takumijo just chuckled. \"I'll give you a call the next time Yori is out of town. We'll hook up.\"</p><p>\"You don't have to wait until I'm out of town,\" Yori said arrogantly. \"Feel free to take her any time.\"</p><p>Masaaki and Kenshin entered the kitchen and said good morning to everyone. Kenshin headed straight for the coffee pot and poured himself a cup. \"Yuck, who made this? Where is Ich?\"</p><p>\"What's wrong with the coffee?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"It's weak,\" Kenshin told her.</p><p>\"Remind me not to get out of my bed in the morning to fix you spoiled bunch of pop tarts breakfast ever again. The next time you can starve.\"</p><p>Kenshin rolled his eyes at her like that hurt her feelings.</p><p>\"Don't mess with me Kenny,\" she warned him. \"I'm postal this morning.\"</p><p>\"Ich took his wife to Kyoto on a date. They're coming back tomorrow,\" Takumijo told Kenshin.</p><p>\"Tomorrow?\" Masaaki asked. \"Darn. I wanted to tell you all the good news.\"</p><p>\"What good news?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"You guys are going to Europe. Mr. Niigata has booked a tour for you.\"</p><p>\"When?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"In two months. You'll do several major cities and will be there until the end of November.\"</p><p>\"But the babies are due in October,\" Cristal said.</p><p>\"Shaundra can't travel to Europe.\"</p><p>\"Shaundra is not performing, Ms. Gentry. Her husband is.</p><p>I'll see that she has someone to stay with her until she delivers and then I'll fly Ichiro back when she goes into labor.\"</p><p>Damn, what a fucked up situation, Cristal thought.</p><p>Interference before Shaundra and Ichiro can get their relationship back on track. \"But that would mean they'd be separated again.\"</p><p>\"I hope their love is strong enough to last this time,\"</p><p>Satoshi said.</p><p>\"Yes, let's hope,\" Yori agreed.</p><p>Why did she get the feeling that neither of them meant what they just said?</p><p>\"We're home,\" Ichiro announced as he and Shaundra entered the farmhouse.</p><p>Cristal came down the stairs to greet them. \"Welcome back, guys. How was your romantic weekend?\"</p><p>\"Splendid?\" Ichiro said. \"It was the best two days of my life. Where are the others?\"</p><p>\"In the music room with Masaaki. They're waiting for you.\"</p><p>Ichiro kissed his wife of the cheek and carried their luggage up to their room, and then he ran back down and headed to the music room.</p><p>Cristal led Shaundra to the den. \"You have to tell me all about it.\"</p><p>\"It was very romantic,\" Shaundra said. \"I got to meet Ich's family and they're planning some type of big, elaborate christening celebration when the babies are born.\"</p><p>\"It could be some type of family tradition,\" Cristal told her.</p><p>\"How come you know so much?\" Shaundra asked sitting down on the sofa. Cristal sat across from her.</p><p>\"I've lived here most of my life.\"</p><p>\"So what does it involve?\"</p><p>Cristal shrugged. \"It probably involves some long religious ceremony.\"</p><p>Shaundra groaned. \"I hate stuff like that. Ich is a Christian not a Buddhist.\"</p><p>\"He was probably born a Buddhist, but don't fret. I'm sure it will only last a day. Once it's over the babies' births will be registered and they will be officially and legally Japanese citizens.\"</p><p>Which meant she had to make a decision before then?</p><p>\"And you'll be...\"</p><p>\"Forever tied to Japan,\" Shaundra continued.</p><p>\"Awe, honey. You're still trying to make a decision?\"</p><p>\"Yes, Ich has been unbelievably sweet and attentive lately, but I have the feeling that the bottom is about to drop out.\"</p><p>\"Damn you Louisiana voodoo women and your premonitions. It is. Aomori is going back on tour.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Shaundra asked. \"When?\"</p><p>\"In about two months. Mr. Niigata has arranged for them to tour Europe.\"</p><p>\"Europe? I can't...\"</p><p>\"Yes, I know. Masaaki said he's going to arrange someone to stay with you.\"</p><p>\"And Ich never mentioned a tour.\"</p><p>\"Ich doesn't know yet. Masaaki just told the rest of them yesterday.\"</p><p>\"How long this time?\" She didn't know if she could stand another separation.</p><p>\"Until November.\"</p><p>\"But...\"</p><p>\"Masaaki is going to fly Ichiro back for the births.\"</p><p>\"It's nice how they plan our lives,\" Shaundra said sarcastically.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" Cristal said. \"But it comes with Aomori. You knew Ichiro was a superstar when you married him.\"</p><p>Shaundra sighed. \"Yeah, I did know. I just didn't know I was still fertile. Now he's talking about having other babies.\"</p><p>Cristal chuckled. \"That must have been some weekend. I wish I could stay with you but I have to travel with them.\"</p><p>\"Thanks, honey. I might get my daughter to stay with me.\"</p><p>\"Tricia?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"Yes, Juanda has her own brood to deal with.\"</p><p>\"Didn't she and Satoshi used to date?\"</p><p>\"For a while,\" Shaundra said. \"But she had to finish college and he had to return to Japan.\"</p><p>\"Were they serious?\"</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Shaundra said. \"I was too busy worrying about marrying Ich. Anyway I know what you're thinking.</p><p>Satoshi will be in Europe.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I guess so.\" Cristal sighed. \"One other questions. Do men gravitate to her like planets like they do with you?\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"No. My baby is a quiet good girl.</p><p>She's never given me a day of misery and as far as I know she's only dating one boy at a time.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" Cristal said.</p><p>\"So what went on while I was away?\"</p><p>\"I met Satoshi's family, and Yi-jun dumped me.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Shaundra asked. \"You met Satoshi's family?\"</p><p>Cristal nodded. \"His parents and his older brother. He's a lawyer and a bit of a jerk.\"</p><p>\"Honey, that's good news. That means Satoshi is serious about you.\"</p><p>\"Not really. I kind of bullied him into taking me to meet them,\" Cristal confessed.</p><p>\"It wasn't his idea?\"</p><p>\"No, he asked me out on a date and asked me what I wanted to do and I told him I'd like to meet his parents and see where he lived.\"</p><p>\"But he still took you. That counts for something. And you say he has an older brother? What's he like?\"</p><p>\"Tall, good-looking, and a bit of a stuffed shirt. He spent the evening trying to insult Satoshi.\"</p><p>\"But that's what older siblings do. Does he resemble Satoshi?\"</p><p>\"A little, but Satoshi looks more like his mother. What about Ichiro's family?\"</p><p>\"They all resemble, but he's the only one with blue eyes.\"</p><p>She chuckled. \"Isn't this an interesting development? We've both met our extended families.\"</p><p>\"They're not my extended family,\" Cristal argued. \"But Mrs. Hayashi liked me. We're going shopping next week.\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed. \"Argue if you want but I was married a hundred years and I never went shopping with my mother-in- law. Cristal, my dear, I hear wedding bells in your future.\"</p><p>\"How come you didn't say anything when I told you that Yi-jun dumped me?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"What did you want me to say? Months ago you asked me for a sign about which one of them you should chose. Now you have it.\"</p><p>\"I think I kind of blew it with Satoshi the other night. We were right in the middle of taking our relationship up to the next level when Yi-jun called.\"</p><p>Shaundra frowned at her. \"You mean you turned down a night of passion with one of the sexiest guys in Asia for a phone call?\"</p><p>Cristal nodded.</p><p>\"Poor Satoshi.\"</p><p>\"Well, I hadn't heard from Yi-jun in weeks. I didn't want to be rude.\"</p><p>\"I would have been rude,\" Shaundra replied. \"It keeps them on their toes.\"</p><p>\"So, did you give in?\" Cristal asked her.</p><p>Shaundra smirked. \"Yeah, he brought out the big guns...romantic music, plush hotel suite and the saddest puppy dog eyes.\"</p><p>\"And?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"The biggest erection you've ever seen.\"</p><p>\"I knew it,\" Cristal almost shouted. \"I just knew it. I knew those pretty boys are packing. Nature could not have made them so beautiful and just made them mediocre in the pelvic area.\" She sighed. \"I thought Yi-jun was just the exception.\"</p><p>Shaundra nearly rolled of the sofa laughing. \"Girl, you're going to send me into premature labor. I had that all checked out moments after I met them. I call it my eye to thigh flirt.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Cristal asked laughing.</p><p>\"My eye to thigh flirt. I look them in the eyes and then I make my way down. Guys love it.\"</p><p>\"I'm going to try that,\" Cristal said.</p><p>\"But not on Ich,\" Shaundra warned.</p><p>\"Oh, no way,\" Cristal said. \"But I did volunteer to be the cream in their cookie if he and Satoshi ever take their relationship to the next level.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Shaundra asked laughing.</p><p>Cristal nodded. \"Poor Ichiro almost passed out from embarrassment when I told them that.\"</p><p>\"He says that American women are to forward. I just think we are not afraid to say what's on our mind.\"</p><p>\"Speaking of brainless women, Amaya stopped by yesterday?\"</p><p>Shaundra stopped laughing. \"What did that heifer want?\"</p><p>\"She and Yori came over for breakfast and she started insulting me five minutes after she got into the door. My eyes were all puffy from crying all night over Yi-jun and she just had to bring it to everyone's attention.\"</p><p>\"She's just jealous,\" Shaundra said. \"You're still prettier than her even with raccoon eyes.\"</p><p>\"She even stood up to Yori and flirted with Takumijo.\"</p><p>\"What?</p><p>\"Satoshi made a crude joke about you making Ichiro cry during sex, and Yori mentioned something about he wished it was him.\"</p><p>\"The man cried once on our wedding night and that's because it was his first time. He's a big boy now.\" She smirked. \"He was so cute, and screw Yori.\"</p><p>\"You're horrible,\" Cristal teased. \"And a romantic.\"</p><p>\"It helps. So I'm going to be here all by myself for two months.\"</p><p>\"Look at it as a vacation and it will give you time to make that decision,\" Cristal said.</p><p>\"That's right. It will give me time to work things out, plus finish the book I'm working on.\" She rose. \"I guess I better go up and get some rest. I have a doctor's appointment in the morning.\"</p><p>\"Is Ichiro going with you?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"He's supposed to, but I better get used to doing things by myself. It always ends up that way.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"The babies are doing fine, Mrs. Yoshida,\" Dr. Sou said to Shaundra the next day. He helped her sit up on the examination table. \"Where's Mr. Yoshida? He hasn't missed a prenatal visit since you returned to Osaka.\"</p><p>\"He's busy rehearsing for a tour and a charity concert benefit,\" Shaundra told him. Mr. Niigata had arrived early this morning and whisked the fellows out of the house and off to some unknown location before she woke up. Ichiro left a note informing her that he was sorry he couldn't go with her and didn't know what time he'd be returning.</p><p>\"Did you drive here by yourself?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Shaundra answered. \"I'm beginning to get the hang of maneuvering around in all the traffic.\"</p> <p>\"You might think about having someone drive you here the next time. We don't want to take any chances of you getting hurt or kidnapped.\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed. \"Why would someone want to kidnap me?\"</p><p>\"Because you're a world famous author and you're married to a pop idol.\"</p><p>And not to mention a much hated person on the Aomori fan club list. Not a day went by when she didn't receive threatening e-mail or Twitter blasts and even more so now that someone had announced her pregnancy on Aomori's home page. \"Okay,\" Shaundra agreed. \"I'll get someone to drive me next time.\"</p><p>\"Good, you're entering your third trimester and we have to be very careful with the babies.\"</p> <p>\"Is it still only two inside of me?\" she asked. \"I've been putting on a lot of weight.\"</p><p>Dr. Sou chuckled. \"\"As far as I can tell you're carry two very large...\"</p><p>\"Shush, don't tell me their sex.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure? Most women want to know so they can buy a specific color of clothing for the babies.\"</p><p>\"I'm sure I don't want to know. Aomori wants boys and everyone else wants girls.\"</p><p>\"And what do you want?\" The doctor asked.</p> <p>\"Healthy babies,\" Shaundra answered. And a hysterectomy.</p><p>\"I want you to stick to a no-salt diet, drink plenty of milk, and take your vitamins.\"</p><p>\"Is it still safe to have intercourse?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"Yes, for now. I'll let you know when you need to stop.\" He paused. \"I guess it is hard having a young husband.\"</p><p>\"Not really,\" Shaundra replied. \"Except for him being potent. He wants to have more kids after these.\"</p><p>\"Does he know your true age?\" the doctor asked.</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"Apparently he thinks women can continue to push out babies well into their sixties.\"</p><p>\"It is not impossible,\" the doctor replied. \"But I do not recommend it. You'll be too old to run behind them.\"</p> <p>\"I'm already too old to run behind them,\" Shaundra replied. \"Anything else?\"</p><p>\"Well, except for your blood pressure, you're in excellent shape. Your pressure is normal at the moment but I'm still keeping an eye on it.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" Shaundra said. That's all she needed was one more person keeping an eye on her salt intake. She'd kill for a potato chip right about now.</p><p>\"So when is the tour beginning?\" the doctor asked.</p><p>\"In two months,\" Shaundra told him. \"They're doing Europe this time.\"</p><p>\"Will he come back to Osaka for the births?\"</p><p>Shaundra shrugged. \"I'm not holding my breath on that. I knew what I was getting into when I married an idol. He has to earn a living.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I supposed he does.\" The doctor scribbled something on his pad. \"I'd like to see you back her in a month. Then I will decide whether we have to put you in the hospital in September or October.\"</p><p>\"Do I still need a Cesarean?\"</p><p>The doctor nodded. \"It looks that way. These babies are too big for you to deliver normally, and I don't want to harm you in the process.\"</p><p>\"I understand. I'll let Ichiro and the others know.\"</p><p>The doctor rose and helped her off the table. \"You can get dressed now.\" He bowed and left her to change.</p><p>Shaundra removed the hospital gown and got dressed. Ten minutes later she had her next appointment scheduled and was about to leave when she remembered something.</p><p>\"Can you tell me where I can find the anesthesiology department?\" she asked the receptionist.</p><p>The receptionist gave her the information and Shaundra left and rode the elevator to the fourth floor. She walked up to another information desk. \"Hello, I'm trying to find Keiichi Wantanabe.\"</p><p>\"Oh, I'm sorry. He just went down to the cafeteria for lunch.\"</p><p>\"Where is the cafeteria?\"</p><p>\"It's located on the second floor to the right of the elevators,\" the young woman told her.</p><p>Shaundra bowed. \"Thank you.\" She smiled at the woman and headed back to the elevator. Moments later she stepped inside the cafeteria. She spotted Dr. Wantanabe seated at a table, amazed that she still remembered him. He hadn't changed much. He was a nice looking Japanese man with thick black hair and dark brown eyes. He wore a hospital uniform and was busy eating a sandwich when she approached.</p><p>\"Good afternoon, Dr. Wantanabe,\" Shaundra said.</p><p>The man looked up, his eyes widened and then he jumped out of his seat. \"Mrs. Yoshida, is that you?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded and smiled at him.</p><p>He hurried to her and hugged her, ignoring the stares from the other diners. \"I'm so glad you've awakened and you're safe. Please join me. Can I get you something to eat?\" He helped her into a chair.</p><p>\"No, thank you. I have to have all of my meals specially prepared.\"</p><p>\"Oh, that's right. You have hypertension.\"</p><p>Shaundra sighed. She supposed that little bit of information will be written on her tombstone when she died.</p><p>\"Please finish eating your meal. I just came by to thank you for saving my life.\"</p><p>\"No thanks needed. I would have done the same for anyone,\" he said modestly.</p><p>\"Yes, but you risked your own life to do so.\"</p><p>Keiichi went back to his seat. \"I couldn't very well leave you to die. You needed to live.\"</p><p>\"Thank you. I appreciate you saving me, looking after me and getting me safely to Tokyo.\"</p><p>\"When did you wake up?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Several weeks ago. I didn't know where the heck I was or what had happened?\"</p><p>He leaned forward. \"How much of it do you remember?\"</p><p>\"I remember the earthquake but everything after that is a blank.\"</p><p>He leaned back in his seat. \"Nothing else is important.\"</p><p>\"I also remember that kiss,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>Keiichi blushed. \"I'm sorry for being so forward, but you were terrified and I thought it would calm you down.\"</p><p>\"It did,\" Shaundra said with a smile. \"Thank you.\" Of all the things to remember.</p><p>\"So, did your family find you? I remember a young man coming here to find me a couple of months ago. He said he was your brother-in-law.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"Satoshi. He's not really my brother-in- law. He's in a singing group with my husband, but he is a very dear friend of mine.\"</p><p>\"You're married to a singer?\" Keiichi asked.</p><p>\"Yes, have you heard of a pop group named Aomori?\"</p><p>\"Are you kidding? Of course I've heard of them. Wait, you're married to Ichiro Yoshida?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded.</p><p>\"No wonder I thought I recognized the young man who visited me. So is he the father?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Shaundra replied. \"He's way too young for me, but yes.\"</p><p>\"He's one lucky fellow,\" Keiichi replied.</p><p>\"He knows that.\"</p><p>\"So what are you doing in Osaka?\"</p><p>\"I live here,\" Shaundra said. \"I had a doctor's appointment earlier and I thought I'd drop by and say thank you. I will always be grateful for what you did for me and Aomori.\" She paused. \"What are you doing on Friday night?\"</p><p>\"I'm off,\" he answered. \"Why?\"</p><p>Shaundra opened her purse and pulled out two tickets. \"I want you to be my guest at a private performance for Aomori.</p><p>It's a charity event for Japanese earthquake victims.\"</p><p>\"No,\" I can't accept those,\" Keiichi said. \"That's for your friends.\"</p><p>\"You're my friend,\" Shaundra told him. \"And it would mean the world to me if you accept.\"</p><p>\"I don't have a tuxedo to wear to something like that,\"</p><p>Keiichi said.</p><p>\"You don't need one. A suit will do, and you'll get to meet Aomori and the rest of my friends. They will all want to meet you.\"</p><p>Keiichi finally accepted the tickets.</p><p>Shaundra rose. \"I have to go.\"</p><p>Keiichi rose. And walked over to her.</p><p>Shaundra rose up on her toes and kissed him on the cheek. \"Thank you for my life and the life of my babies.\"</p><p>Keiichi wiped a tear from his eyes. \"You are one special lady, Ms. Yoshida.\"</p><p>\"Call me Shaundra. We're friends remember?\"</p><p>Keiichi nodded. \"Thanks for the tickets. My mother is going to be so excited.\"</p><p>\"Your mother? You're not married?\"</p><p>\"No. I'm still waiting for the right woman,\" he confessed.</p><p>\"Lucky girl,\" Shaundra replied. \"You're one hell of a kisser.\" She smiled at him, bowed, and left the cafeteria.</p><p>Goro Niigata looked over at his motley group of singers remembering how they looked when he first recruited them as kids. Now they were all taller than him and the hottest group in Asia. He sighed. No father could be prouder. And what a handful of trouble.</p><p>Yori, the leader with the beautiful face and the arrogant ego of a God had gotten himself married to a pain-in-the-butt wife who couldn't control her spending but who loved Yori dearly.</p><p>Satoshi, the rock on which Aomori was built, used to be arrogant, flirtatious, and a bit of a ladies' man, but now he'd mellowed into one of the greatest piano men in the country.</p><p>Everyone always went to him with their problems, but he couldn't recall a time when Satoshi ever complained about anything. He didn't know if it was a good thing to keep all his concerns bottled up, but he figured sooner or later he'd find someone to confide in.</p><p>Takumijo, the dancing man had been trouble from the moment he'd been recruited. He had doubts about that one in the beginning. He'd been feisty and full of play. But when it came right down to it, Takumijo had more discipline than any of the others. He knew what he wanted out of life even if some of his decisions got him into trouble. While he and Masaaki worried about Takumijo's relationship with the actor Osamu, Goro decided not to mention it again and hoped Takumijo would make the right decision when the time came.</p><p>That left the maknae, Ichiro. He grown and matured over the years. In the beginning he barely spoke. He had the beautiful voice of an angel but he was so shy. Then suddenly he blossomed into maturity and fell in love and married a woman twice his age. Goro didn't think that it was a good idea at the time, and still didn't. But it was too late now and besides, Shaundra was pregnant.</p><p>Oh, yes, he'd heard the rumors about the babies not being Ichiro's, but no one would know the truth for a couple of months. His money was on Harper Kehoe. Only a fool could not see that the man was hopelessly in love with his star author and she had some serious feelings for him too. The man even brought her clothes and flew halfway around the world a couple of times to see her. In his heart he hoped Harper wasn't the father because if he turned out to be, all hell was going to break loose in Aomori's camp and he'd be the one who'd have to put out the fire.</p><p>\"Well, what do you guys think about going to Europe,\"</p><p>Goro asked them.</p><p>\"It is a great opportunity,\" Yori said. \"And it's time we get back out on the stage again. I am beginning to go stir crazy just sitting around the house.\"</p><p>\"That's because Amaya is there with you,\" Takumijo teased. \"I told you I'd take her off your hands when you get bored.\"</p><p>Yori smirked and rolled his eyes at Takumijo.</p><p>\"You have to choreograph me some killer steps for the tour,\" Goro told Takumijo. \"You won't have time for chasing Amaya.\"</p><p>\"Working it all out in my head,\" Takumijo replied. \"I'm just waiting on the music.\"</p><p>Goro turned to Satoshi. \"You're up piano man. Got any music we can use for this tour?\"</p><p>\"Some,\" Satoshi answered. \"Ichiro has written some wonderful songs and we are thinking about doing one of them Friday at the benefit concert to introduce it. I'll be working closely with Ich for the next couple of weeks.\"</p><p>\"Not to close,\" Ichiro said. \"I can only tolerate you in spurts.\"</p><p>Takumijo laughed at Ichiro's joke. Now, that's the Aomori he remembered. They were always laughing as kids and teasing each other good-naturedly.</p><p>\"Are you happy to be going back on tour, Ich?\" Goro asked him.</p><p>\"Yes, but I've torn emotionally. I don't want to leave Shaundra.\"</p><p>\"I'm sure she wished you only the best,\" Goro said. \"She will be okay. I'll ask Amaya to keep an eye on her.\"</p><p>\"No,\" everyone said simultaneously.</p><p>\"What's wrong with Amaya?\" Goro asked.</p><p>\"They don't get along,\" Yori explained.</p><p>\"Why?\" Goro asked, enjoying seeing Yori squirm.</p><p>\"She's a bit jealous of Shaundra,\" Yori said.</p><p>Takumijo and Satoshi chuckled.</p><p>\"In what way? They're both women, and they are both talented in their own right. Why is Amaya jealous?\"</p><p>\"Because Yori still has a thing for my wife,\" Ichiro answered.</p><p>Goro looked from Ichiro to Yori. Yori, Lord help him, didn't have the decency to deny Ichiro's allegation. In the beginning the two of them were close. Yori looked out for the shy Ichiro and acted like a big brother toward him. Now, the two of them seemed so distant. \"Anyway, we'll find someone to look after Shaundra while we're gone.\"</p><p>\"She will go live with my sisters,\" Ichiro stated. \"She is family now. They will see to her needs.\"</p><p>Yori laughed. \"Have you run that past Shaundra yet?\"</p><p>\"I don't have to run anything by her. She is my wife and will do as I ask.\"</p><p>Takumijo groaned. \"You are so cute when you take charge, Ich. But you're wrong this time. Shaundra will listen but she's going to refuse.\"</p><p>\"What makes you think that she will refuse?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"One, Shaundra is your equal not someone to boss around, and two, she's not the type to have others taking care of her.</p><p>I'm sure she loves your sisters and Daichi but her home is the farmhouse. We can hire someone to stay with her like we did the last time.\"</p><p>\"I can have Harper check on her,\" Goro suggested. \"He'll be in town another couple of months.\" Why are Takumijo, Satoshi, and Yori looking at me like that?</p><p>\"No,\" Satoshi said. \"Not Harper. We can't leave Shaundra alone with him for two months.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" Goro asked. \"He's her boss and her friend.\"</p><p>\"And he buys her underwear,\" Masaaki answered. \"We will not be leaving her with Harper Kehoe.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" Goro agreed. \"Harper is out. We'll stick to the original plan and hire someone to stay with her. We'll also get Ichiro's brother Daichi to make sure she sticks to her diet. I'm sure he won't mind stepping in and taking care of her.\"</p><p>Ichiro paled. \"What? No, out of the question. Not Daichi.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" Goro asked. \"He's your older brother.\"</p><p>\"That's exactly the reason,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>Takumijo chuckled. \"I don't think you've noticed, Mr.</p><p>Niigata, but Shaundra draws men to her like flies to a picnic.\"</p><p>All the men in the room nodded in agreement.</p><p>\"We can't trust other men around her,\" Takumijo said.</p><p>\"But she's pregnant,\" Goro argued. \"No man will want to flirt with he in that condition.\"</p><p>Every man in the room, including Kenshin looked at him like he was crazy.</p><p>\"Have you seen her boobs?\" Yori asked him. \"They are phenomenal.\"</p><p>\"And the behind is stellar,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"And she has the prettiest eyes,\" Kenshin said.</p><p>\"And...\" Masaaki didn't have a chance to comment.</p><p>\"And you guys are so dead if you touch her,\" Ichiro warned.</p><p>Goro smiled. Now he understood. \"Okay, no man is to come near her. On to the next subject, the charity benefit.\"</p><p>The meeting went on late into the evening. Afterward, Ichiro invited everyone to his restaurant for dinner.</p><p>\"Good evening, Mr. Yoshida,\" a pretty, young waitress said to Ichiro when they arrived at his Osaka restaurant.</p><p>\"Good evening, Eri,\" Ichiro replied. \"Nice to see you again.\"</p><p>Satoshi watched the young woman's eyes light up as she spoke with Ich, and she gave him such a sweet smile.</p><p>\"We have a private room available,\" Eri told Ichiro. \"Follow me.\" Eri turned on her heels and walked away.</p><p>Satoshi noticed a sensual switching of her hips as Ichiro followed her. Takumijo elbowed him in the side, smiled, but did not comment. Yori thankfully had seen what they saw and didn't comment either.</p><p>Eri opened the door to the private banquet room and continued to smile at and only speak to Ichiro. \"I will tell Daichi and the chef that you are here.\" She paused. \"Will you need sake?\"</p><p>That definitely meant that she knew Ichiro well.</p><p>\"No,\" Ichiro said. \"I've given up the stuff.\"</p><p>\"Shochu and plenty of it,\" Takumijo said flopping down on a pillow on the floor.</p><p>\"Shochu and tea,\" Ichiro told Eri as the others got comfortable on the floor too.</p><p>\"Yes, Mr. Yoshida.\" Eri bowed. \"I'll bring it in personally.\"</p><p>Ichiro joined them on the floor.</p><p>\"Who is that?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Her name is Eri. She's been working here about six months.\"</p><p>\"Is she single?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Ichiro answered. \"She's twenty-one and just graduated from Osaka University.\"</p><p>\"Oh, she's a smart girl,\" Yori said. \"Don't bother Tak.</p><p>Smart girls are not what their cracked up to be.\"</p><p>\"Eri is a nice girl,\" Ichiro replied. \"She wants to be a chef.\"</p><p>How come Ichiro knew so much about her? He bet Ichiro knew more about the young woman than he knew about his wife. \"Where did Shaundra go to college?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Ichiro said. \"Why are you bringing her up?\"</p><p>\"Just curious,\" Satoshi said. Point proven. \"You seem to know a lot about Eri. How come?\"</p><p>\"How come what?\" Ichiro asked. \"People, for some reason lately have been entertaining me in conversation. She's an employee, so we have to talk occasionally.\"</p><p>A year ago they couldn't get Ichiro to speak to a fan. Now he was Mr. Talkative.</p><p>\"Did you introduce her to Shaundra when you brought her here for dinner?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"No, I don't think so. Why would I introduce my wife to a waitress?\"</p><p>Takumijo chuckled. \"No particular reason.\"</p><p>The others laughed.</p><p>\"You guys are too much,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>The door opened and Ichiro's brother Daichi entered. He spoke to everyone. \"Where's Shaundra?\" he asked.</p><p>\"At home,\" Ichiro replied. \"We came straight here from rehearsal.\"</p><p>\"Rehearsal? Does that mean you're going back on the road?\" He sat down next to Ichiro.</p><p>\"Yes, we're touring Europe.\"</p><p>Eri entered carrying in the shochu and glasses. She knelt down next to Ichiro and placed the glasses and drinks in the middle of the circle, bowed and then left again. Ichiro's eyes followed her out the door.</p><p>\"When?\" Daichi asked him.</p><p>\"In two months,\" Goro answered as he poured shochu in a glass before one of the younger men served him.</p><p>\"But isn't Shaundra due around that time?\" Daichi asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Ichiro answered.</p><p>\"And you're just going to leave your pregnant wife and go on the road?\"</p><p>Ichiro sighed. \"It is my job. Shaundra understands this.\"</p><p>\"And you are her husband. Your place is at her side. Didn't you learn anything the last time?\"</p><p>\"Do not remind me of my responsibilities. I have to earn a living to provide for my wife and kids, and I'm a member of Aomori. I have to perform.\"' Satoshi shook his head. Someone had brainwashed Ichiro but he didn't know who.</p><p>\"But?\" Daichi argued.</p><p>\"But what? What do you want me to do?\" Ichiro asked. \"I walked away in China when she disappeared. I can't do that again. She's had four other babies before. It's like riding a horse. She will know what to do when the time comes.\"</p><p>Satoshi gazed over at Ichiro. He knew him well enough to know that he didn't want to leave Shaundra but to go against Mr. Niigata was suicide.</p><p>\"I will fly back here the moment she goes into labor. I will not miss the birth of my sons.\"</p><p>\"And what about the christening? Will you be here for that or will you leave her to do it all herself?\"</p><p>Ichiro didn't answer Daichi.</p><p>\"What christening?\" Goro asked.</p><p>\"The babies' births have to be registered,\" Daichi told him.</p><p>\"I will register them,\" Ichiro said. \"They are my babies.\"</p><p>\"Like you...\"</p><p>The look Ichiro gave his brother silenced him. What was Daichi about to say?</p><p>\"I will do my fatherly duty when the time comes; now can we please change the subject?\"</p><p>\"Very well,\" Daichi said rising. The waiters began bringing in the food. \"Enjoy your meals.\" He bowed to them and left.</p><p>\"What christening?\" Yori asked refusing to give up the subject.</p><p>\"Daichi wants to put on this big elaborate festival for the birth of my kids. They are the first babies born into our family in a long time. I was the last.\"</p><p>\"And look how well that turned out,\" Yori said sarcastically.</p><p>Ichiro glared at him.</p><p>\"When is he planning this festival?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"It was supposed to be in October. He's spoken to the elders of our village and they have agreed to allow him to do it.\"</p><p>\"Maybe he can get it postponed and reschedule it when we return,\" Masaaki suggested. \"A Christmas festival would be nice. This will be Shaundra's first real winter in Japan and she'll get a big hoot out of it.\"</p><p>Ichiro sighed. \"I suppose you're right. I can register the babies' birth then. I will speak with Daichi later about it.\"</p><p>\"Cheer up, Ich,\" Takumijo said opening the soju and pouring himself a glass. Shaundra will understand.\"</p><p>Eri reentered the room and knelt down beside Ichiro again.</p><p>She poured him some tea.</p><p>\"Thank you,\" Ichiro said, smiling at the young woman.</p><p>\"You're welcome, Mr. Yoshida. Please call on me if you need anything else.\"</p><p>\"He won't,\" Takumijo said.</p><p>The young woman looked over at him. She seemed angered at first for the interruption and then she smiled. It didn't quite reach her eyes. She bowed and left.</p><p>Yori looked at Takumijo but did not comment.</p><p>\"This looks delicious,\" Kenshin said breaking the silence.</p><p>Ichiro began to serve them.</p><p>Always the mama-san, Satoshi mused. If he had one good thing to say about Ichiro, their maknae never forgot his place on the food chain even though he was by far richer than most of them. He would always be the youngest member of the group, no matter how tall he grew or how famous he became.</p><p>Satoshi picked up his bowel of rice and scooped some into his mouth, ignoring the conversation going on around him.</p><p>Now who could he get to look after Shaundra to make sure she ate right? Cristal would be perfect company, but she had to travel with Aomori. And, it would be nice if they could send her home to her family during this time, but she wasn't supposed to fly. He guessed they would just rehire the lady who took care of her before, and if Mr. Niigata or Masaaki thought Aomori was going to miss the birth of those babies, both of them were sadly mistaken.</p><p>Hana peeped in a few minutes later.</p><p>All the men tried to rise to their feet.</p><p>\"Sit down,\" she told them. \"I just came in to say hello and to check on your meal. I didn't know you guys were here until Eri told me.\"</p><p>\"Is Daichi working you too hard?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"No,\" Hana replied. \"I was just in the office going over the books. Daichi is a pleasure to work with.\" She looked over at her younger brother. \"How is Shaundra?\"</p><p>\"Fine,\" Ichiro answered.</p><p>\"Well, give her my love. I might drive over to see her in a couple of days to see if she needs anything.\"</p><p>\"That will be nice,\" Ichiro replied. \"She needs feminine company after being cooped up in the farmhouse with us guys.\"</p><p>\"Where is Ms. Gentry? Is she out of town again?\" Hana asked.</p><p>\"No, she's there, but she's busy most of the time.\"</p><p>\"Then I'd be honored to visit her. I'll bring Esuko with me.</p><p>We'll have a girl's day.\" She bowed and left.</p><p>\"Your sister is very pretty,\" Kenshin said to Ichiro.</p><p>\"And off-limits to you,\" Ichiro told him. \"You already have a girlfriend.\"</p><p>\"I don't,\" Yori said.</p><p>Ichiro rolled his eyes at Yori. \"You have a wife. Oh, I forgot. That does not matter to you.\"</p><p>\"Eri's kind of cute too,\" Yori said, ignoring Ichiro's comment.</p><p>\"I haven't noticed,\" Ichiro said eating his rice.</p><p>Yeah right. Guilt is written all over your pretty face.</p><p>Satoshi lifted his bowl of rice.</p><p>The meal ended and they left the restaurant and climbed back into the limousine. Kenshin got in behind the wheel and drove to Mr. Niigata's home, dropped him off first, and then drove to the farmhouse.</p><p>Satoshi spotted Amaya's car the moment they got past the guards and headed toward the front door.</p><p>\"What is she doing here?\" Yori asked. He was out of the car and running up the steps before Kenshin brought the limousine to a full stop. The others followed.</p><p>Satoshi could hear the argument as soon as they entered the farmhouse.</p><p>\"Who are you calling a whore?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"You,\" Amaya said. \"Ichiro is going to divorce your ass when he finds out that those bastards aren't his.\"</p><p>\"Oh, shit,\" Takumijo said. \"They're at it again.\"</p><p>They hurried toward the shouting and found Shaundra, Amaya, and Cristal in the den facing off.</p><p>\"That is uncalled for, Amaya,\" Cristal said. \"You don't know that.\"</p><p>\"Do you hear her denying it? Not once has she said that those babies are Ichiro's. She just waltzed her ass back into this farmhouse like she's the Empress and everybody is afraid to say what they think. Well, I'm not.\"</p><p>\"I don't understand what your problem is, but you better get your skinny ass out of my face,\" Shaundra warned. \"I know who the father of my children is, and I don't need some jealous wench saying otherwise.\"</p><p>\"I can say what I want,\" Amaya said getting into Shaundra's face.</p><p>\"You better back it up before I lay you out,\" Shaundra threatened her again. \"That's the problem with you. You don't have any home training. Your mother should have taught you better instead of letting you do and say anything you want.\"</p><p>\"Like I said before, I can say what I want to say,\" Amaya continued to argue.</p><p>\"You need to keep your mouth shut. You'll live longer that way,\" Shaundra told her.</p><p>\"Are you threatening me?\" Amaya asked.</p><p>\"No, it's a promise,\" Shaundra told her. \"Why are you so sure I messed around on Ichiro? I love my husband. I left my life in the United States and traveled to this place to be with him. If I wanted Harper or Yori, I would have married Harper or Yori. I cannot help it if you're insecure in your marriage.</p><p>Try giving him a blowjob. That might keep him happy for a while.\"</p><p>Satoshi's eyes widened. He'd never heard Shaundra speak like this before.</p><p>\"Only whores do that,\" Amaya replied. \"Is that the reason that these men like you?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Shaundra said. \"They like me because I mind my business. You need to do the same. Now go home, little girl, before I knock you on your ass.\"</p><p>Amaya braced up to Shaundra.</p><p>\"Back away from her,\" Yori said angrily.</p><p>Both Shaundra and Amaya looked at him.</p><p>\"You better listen to him,\" Amaya said to Shaundra.</p><p>\"I'm speaking to you,\" Yori told his wife. \"What are you doing in this woman's house causing trouble?\"</p><p>Amaya glared at Yori like he hit her. \"I came to see if you were here. You're didn't answer your cell phone.\"</p><p>\"I was working. Now step away from her.\"</p><p>\"Or what?\" Amaya asked. \"What would you do me if I touched your precious Shaundra?\"</p><p>\"Is she drunk?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"No,\" Amaya answered. \"Why do you assume that I've been drinking?\"</p><p>\"Because you're stepping way out of line,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>\"You heard her. She's not interested in Yori. She loves Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"Just because she says it doesn't make it so. I see the way her eyes light up whenever Yori is around.\"</p><p>Satoshi looked over at Shaundra. She didn't even have the decency to deny it. She just shrugged and smirked. He sighed. She was getting worst then them with that.</p><p>\"My wife's eyes do not light up when she sees Yori,\" Ichiro finally said. He walked over and wrapped his arms around Shaundra. \"And as for anything else, these are my babies and I wish you wouldn't call my wife names or make statements that you can't prove.\" He removed his arms from around Shaundra and took her hand. He moved her away from Amaya. \"And in the future, please call before you drop by.</p><p>You have a house of your own. Stay there.\"</p><p>\"Are you going to let him talk to me like that, Yori?\"</p><p>Amaya asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Yori replied. \"Ichiro is right. Those are his babies, and I can't help it if Shaundra's eyes light up when she sees me.\"</p><p>\"Dream on, Yori,\" Ichiro said. \"Now if you all will excuse us, I'm taking my wife up to bed.\"</p><p>Takumijo growled at him like a cougar. \"Don't do anything I wouldn't do.\"</p><p>\"I won't,\" Ichiro said. \"I'll do better than you do.\" He and Shaundra left the room, leaving them to deal with Amaya.</p><p>\"I'm leaving,\" Amaya said. \"You can come home or you can stay here with this bunch of losers,\" she told Yori.</p><p>\"Go,\" he told her. \"I'm staying with these losers for a while. I'll be home shortly after I clean up your mess, again.\"</p><p>Amaya stormed past them. The front door slammed shut a few minutes later.</p><p>\"What was that all about?\" Masaaki asked.</p><p>\"She thinks I'm the father of Shaundra's babies,\" Yori explained.</p><p>\"Are you?\" Masaaki asked.</p><p>\"The babies are Ichiro's,\" Yori answered.</p><p>\"That's not what I'm asking you. Is it possible that you are the father?\"</p><p>\"Anything is possible,\" Yori said angrily. He stormed past Masaaki and left the house too.</p><p>Masaaki sat down. \"I don't know what I'm going to do with you guys. What the hell happened to all of you? Maybe I should have stopped you from dating. Sex makes men crazy.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong, Masaaki?\" Satoshi asked. \"You're not getting any?\"</p><p>\"That is none of your business, smart guy. And for what it's worth I'm hoping Ichiro is the father for you guys might find yourself without a maknae, a cook, or a prayer.\"</p><p>Satoshi grimaced. That was true. Without Ichiro, Aomori would be nothing.</p><p>\"And I would appreciate if you guys would think about moving out of this farmhouse after the babies are born so Ichiro and Shaundra can have some privacy. I've found me an apartment and I will be moving out soon.\"</p><p>\"I'll think about it,\" Satoshi said. He rose. \"But not before.\"</p><p>\"Agreed,\" Takumijo said. \"We'll stay until the birth and then find apartments afterward.\"</p><p>\"Fine,\" Masaaki said, rising. \"I'm tired. I'm going to bed.\"</p><p>He left the room, leaving him and Takumijo alone with Cristal.</p><p>They waited until they heard his bedroom door closed before they began bombarding Cristal with questions.</p><p>\"What the hell happened?\" Takumijo asked first.</p><p>Cristal finally sat down. \"Amaya waltzed in here looking for Yori, like she said. And then she started accusing Shaundra of horrible things like sleeping with all of you guys and Harper.</p><p>And saying things about Shaundra's age and accusing her of faking hypertension to get attention. I swear there's something emotionally wrong with that young woman.\"</p><p>\"She's in love,\" Satoshi said. \"And love makes you say and do foolish things, like pass up a night of passion.\"</p><p>\"You're never going to let me forget that are you?\" Cristal asked him.</p><p>\"No,\" Satoshi answered.</p><p>\"Forget you guys,\" Takumijo said rising. \"I'm tired too.\" He left the room.</p><p>\"Do you think Yori can be the babies' father?\" Cristal asked him when they were alone.</p><p>\"No,\" Satoshi answered.</p><p>\"Are you?\"</p><p>Satoshi rolled his eyes at Cristal. He too rose.</p><p>\"Where are you going?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"To bed,\" he answered. \"I've had about enough drama for one evening. He walked out of the room leaving Cristal to think.</p><p>Yori entered his home, still pissed off at what had occurred earlier at the farmhouse. The nerve of Masaaki to question him on such a delicate matter. Why did everyone have to constantly remind him about his little affair with Shaundra?</p><p>He sighed. Of course he knew he only made matters worse when he played mind games with her.</p><p>And what with this crap with Amaya? He'd never seen her quite this bitchy before. What had spurred this sudden rampage? They were just starting to get their lives in order and now more drama. He supposed most of it was his fault.</p><p>Maybe he should try harder to prove that he cared for her. He wouldn't have married her otherwise.</p><p>Yori continued on through the house. All the lights were off which meant Amaya had probably gone to bed. If that were the case, then they'd have their little talk tomorrow. He would try to assure her once again that Shaundra was not a threat to her. He continued up the stairs, hearing the sound of water running. Amaya must be bathing, he thought as he finally hit the top landing. His feet sank into something soft and squishy. It felt like water. Why did the carpet feel like it is wet? He walked a little more and squished a little more all the way to their bedroom door. He turned the knob and entered the room. Something didn't seem right. Yori popped on the light in the bedroom. He slowly took in the scene and then landed on an open prescription bottle on the nightstand. He went over to it picked it up. It was a prescription for Amaya, but it was empty. The sound of water caught his attention again. His feet sank deeply into the squishy, wet carpet as he walked toward the bathroom door. Yori turned the knob and water met him at the door. The tub was overflowing, and the faucets were on full blast.</p><p>Yori hurried over to the tub and pulled back the curtain.</p><p>His eyes widened. Amaya? His wife lay in the tub and she appeared to be sleeping. He did a quick sweep of the situation.</p><p>\"Amaya?\" he called out to her.</p><p>No answer. Unresponsive.</p><p>Panic set in. \"Amaya?\" he called to her again.</p><p>No answer. Unresponsive. Wrists covered in blood.</p><p>\"Oh, my God.\" Yori cried out as he realized the gravity of the situation. He reached into the tub and pulled out the plug.</p><p>He reached for his cell phone in his pocket and quickly dialed for emergency assistance.</p><p>\"Hello,\" the operator said.</p><p>\"Good evening. My name is Yori Morioka.\" He gave the operator his address. \"I just came home and found my wife Amaya unconscious in a tub of water. Please send an ambulance quickly.\"</p><p>\"Right away, Mr. Morioka.\" The call disconnected.</p><p>Yori went down on his knee beside the tub. Tears welled up in his eyes. \"Why Amaya?\" The last of the water went down the drain. He reached out and touched Amaya knowing he shouldn't disturb the scene. Her skin felt cool but still soft.</p><p>He heard the sound of the ambulance blaring outside. He couldn't let them see her like this. He dashed into the bedroom for something to cover her with. That's when he spotted a piece of notepaper on the bed. Yori reached for it and read it. He sighed deeply. Written in Amaya's perfect penmanship was the sentence, \"Yori, I'm sorry. Amaya.\" Yori buried the paper into his pocket, dashed back into the bathroom, and covered Amaya's naked body and then he ran through the wet slippery bedroom to let the paramedics in.</p><p>\"She's in the tub upstairs, first bedroom on the right,\" he told the two men.</p><p>They bowed quickly, hurried into the house and up the stairs.</p><p>Time seem to go very slowly after that. The next thing he remembered was an officer speaking with him as the paramedics worked on Amaya in the ambulance.</p><p>\"Can you tell us what happened?\" one of the officers asked him.</p><p>\"I came home and found her in the tub,\" Yori told the officer.</p><p>\"Did you and your wife have an argument?\"</p><p>\"No,\" he lied. He didn't know why.</p><p>\"Has she ever attempted suicide before?\"</p><p>Suicide? What is he implying? \"No,\" Yori answered. \"She's normally a very happy person.\"</p><p>The officer lifted two plastic evidence bags. One contained the empty prescription bottle. \"She took barbiturates.</p><p>Doctor's don't normally prescribe this for happy people. \"</p><p>Amaya had a prescription for barbiturates? Why? Yori gazed over into the ambulance as the paramedics tried to resuscitate his wife.</p><p>\"We have to get her to the hospital,\" one of the paramedics told police. \"We need Mr. Morioka to accompany his wife.\"</p><p>\"Yes, of course,\" the officer said, stepping aside to let Yori get into the back of the ambulance. \"We'll follow you to the hospital.\"</p><p>Yori sat down and gazed over at Amaya. She looked so peaceful.</p><p>One of the paramedics climbed out the back of the ambulance and closed and secured the doors. The one left inside with him bandaged Amaya's wrists and covered her with a warm blanket. Amaya was still alive, but also still unconscious. Why had she done this? Of course he already knew the answer. It was because of him and his undying love for his best friend's wife. I'm sorry, Amaya. This is all my fault, honey. Please don't die.</p><p>The monitor played a long beep.</p><p>\"She's flatlining,\" the paramedic told him.</p><p>\"Flatlining?\" Yori asked, still trying to comprehend the gravity of the situation.</p><p>\"Her heart has stopped.\" The paramedics grabbed the defibrillator and put it against Amaya's chest.</p><p>Yori couldn't watch. He just covered his eyes and prayed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The phone in Satoshi's room rang. He opened his eyes, looked over at the clock, and then reached for the phone.</p><p>\"Hello.\"</p><p>\"Satoshi?\"</p><p>It sounded like Yori.</p> <p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"It's me, Yori. I need you to come to Osaka Hospital.\"</p><p>Satoshi sat up in bed. Yori sounded desperate and scared.</p><p>\"What's wrong?\"</p><p>\"It's Amaya. She tried to kill herself. Please come.\"</p> <p>Satoshi sprang from the bed. \"I'm on my way. Please stay calm.\" He disconnected the call and dressed, grabbing his phone and wallet. He ran out of his room and down the hall, knocking on bedroom doors to rouse the others.</p><p>A vey sleepy Takumijo opened his door. \"What do you want?\"</p><p>\"Get dressed,\" Satoshi shouted at him. \"We need to get to the hospital. Amaya just tried to kill herself, and Yori is hysterical.\"</p><p>Takumijo dashed into his room. \"Get Ich and Masaaki.\"</p><p>Satoshi didn't have to get the others. They all stood in the hall looking at him. Fifteen minutes later Kenshin floored the SUV's accelerator and drove them to the hospital. Cristal had wanted to accompany them but Ichiro told her to stay with Shaundra.</p><p>Satoshi grimaced. The look on Shaundra's face when she heard the news frightened him. She just smirked and shrugged like she didn't care and just went back to bed.</p> <p>Maybe she wasn't as nice as he assumed. She acted like she was pissed he disturbed her sleep. He knew that the two of them had had some major arguments in the past and late last night, but Amaya was still family and when one of them ached, they all hurt.</p><p>\"Did Yori tell you what happened?\" Masaaki asked.</p><p>\"No, he just said that she tried to kill herself. I think we all can figure out why.\" He looked over to the seat across from him. Ichiro sat with his head pressed against the window.</p><p>Was he asleep? Satoshi peered over again. No. He didn't think so. \"Are you okay, Ich?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Ichiro said. \"Amaya could be dying.\"</p><p>Satoshi hadn't expected such sadness from Ichiro.</p><p>\"She'll be okay,\" Masaaki said. \"She's a fighter.\"</p><p>\"Fighters don't attempt suicide,\" Ichiro replied.</p> <p>\"I wonder what set her off?\" Masaaki asked.</p><p>\"Yori defending Shaundra over her,\" Takumijo said.</p><p>\"But you saw how she was all up in Shaundra's face,\"</p><p>Satoshi said. \"He had to stop her.\"</p><p>\"Maybe you guys shouldn't have brought Shaundra back home,\" Ichiro said sadly.</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"Nothing is the same. Shaundra's different, Amaya's different, and we're different than before.\"</p><p>Yes, he had noticed the change but it didn't seem too bad as long as Shaundra was safe and sound. \"It will be better,\"</p><p>Satoshi assured him. \"Amaya will get through this and Shaundra will have two healthy babies. Our lives will go back to normal.\"</p><p>\"No, it won't,\" Ichiro said. \"I don't think things will ever be the same.\"</p><p>Kenshin drove into the parking lot of the hospital and found a spot in the visitor's parking lot. They got out and hurried into the emergency door.</p><p>Masaaki took the lead and asked questions at the triage desk.</p><p>\"She in recovery,\" the nurse told him. \"But she's still unconscious.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" Masaaki uttered. \"Now I understand. Where is her husband?\"</p><p>The nurse rifled through some paperwork. \"He's in the recovery room with her. He has not left her side.\"</p><p>\"Could you let him know that his manager and his brothers are here?\"</p><p>The nurse picked up the phone and called the recovery room nurse. \"He's on his way out,\" she told Masaaki.</p><p>Moments later the doors to the emergency room opened and a bedraggled Yori exited. His expensive charcoal gray suit looked wrinkled. He collapsed in the seat next to Satoshi.</p><p>\"There was so much blood,\" Yori moaned. \"Oh, my God, I thought I lost her.\"</p><p>Satoshi put his arm around Yori's shoulder. \"She will recover. She's too mean not to.\"</p><p>Yori laid his head on Satoshi's shoulder, and Satoshi tenderly stroked his head. \"I've never been so scared in my life. Why did she do it? Am I really that bad to be with?\"</p><p>Satoshi leaned and gently kissed Yori on the forehead.</p><p>Their fearless leader talked a good game but deep inside he was still little Yori who feared thunderstorms and being ridiculed for being far too pretty to be a man. The damage ran deep and Yori tried to make up for it with a bigger-than- life persona. \"Don't blame yourself for it,\" Satoshi told him, still stroking his forehead. \"She made the decision.\"</p><p>\"I knew something was wrong when she attacked Shaundra the way she did. Granted she's the jealous, possessive type, but I never knew my teasing and flirting would send her over the edge.\" He body shuddered. \"She had a prescription for barbiturates.\"</p><p>\"And you didn't know about the prescription?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Yori answered. \"She never seemed ill, just a big high-strung. But you know her; she's been like that since I met her.\"</p><p>True, maybe they should have noticed something amiss way back then. \"How is she doing?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"She's unconscious, but she's breathing on her own since they pumped the pills out of her stomach.\"</p><p>\"How much did she take?\" Masaaki asked.</p><p>\"The whole bottle,\" Yori answered with a sob. \"If I hadn't gotten there...\"</p><p>\"But you did,\" Satoshi told him. \"That's all that matters.\"</p><p>Ichiro came over and sat down on the other side of Yori.</p><p>\"We will get through this,\" he said. \"She is family and family stick together no matter how many arguments we get into. I am sorry for any part I played in this little mishap.\"</p><p>Yori raised his right hand and stroked Ichiro's cheek, but did not say anything. At times like this it wasn't the sentiment said but the love behind it.</p><p>\"Satoshi says that Amaya's still in recovery,\" Cristal told Shaundra after she got off the phone with him. \"They'll be home after Yori returns. They sent him home earlier to change and to get some rest.\"</p><p>\"That's good,\" Shaundra said adding sugar and lemon to her tea.</p><p>\"Why would she do something like this?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"What good does ending your life do?\"</p><p>\"She's weak,\" Shaundra replied. \"And has low self- esteem.\"</p><p>\"I suppose you're right,\" Cristal said. Shaundra didn't seem broken up by what had happened. In fact, it didn't seem to faze her at all. \"I don't think she'll be able to go to Europe. Satoshi said her parents want to take her home with them while she recovers.\"</p><p>\"That's what parents are supposed to do when their kids make stupid decisions,\" Shaundra said.</p><p>\"Ouch, why so cold, Mrs. Yoshida?\"</p><p>\"Because it's true. It is as much their fault as Amaya's. No man is worth killing yourself over. Her parents should have taught her that.\"</p><p>Cristal raised an eyebrow in disbelief. \"Not even Ich?\"</p><p>\"No, not even him. I have enough trouble dealing with my own body trying to wipe me out without me helping it.</p><p>Granted, I did stupid things like eating food with salt, but I never tried to kill myself with it. And like you said, what purpose would it serve?\"</p><p>\"Satoshi also told me that she slit her wrists.\"</p><p>\"Still a cowardly way to do it. Amaya didn't want to die,\"</p><p>Shaundra told Cristal. \"She knew Yori was on his way home.</p><p>She did it for sympathy and to see him suffer. Women do things like this all the time.\"</p><p>\"How do you know this?\"</p><p>\"Because I've been around a long time and I've seen just about everything,\" Shaundra told her. \"She thought she could guilt Yori into loving her.\"</p><p>\"Maybe you're right.\" Damn, Shaundra has such a brutal outlook on life. She wondered what had happened to her in the past to make her feel this way. \"Do you think Yori will change?\"</p><p>\"For a while,\" Shaundra answered. \"But then he'll revert back to his old self. The man loves me and nothing will change that. Amaya knows this and I'm sure it's hard to be second in your husband's life. But instead of taking her frustrations out of me she should have found a way to make him love her. Her death wouldn't have changed anything except maybe make Yori free to come after me and interfere in my marriage.\"</p><p>\"Don't you feel a tiny bit guilty about some of this?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"Hell no,\" Shaundra answered coldly. \"Well, let me take that back, yes. I should have refused to ever come to Japan.</p><p>Had I stayed my ass on American soil most of this would not have happened. But I didn't cause her to become suicidal. If it wasn't me, it would have been some other woman Yori messed with. I won't take responsibility for her shortcomings.\"</p><p>Well put, Cristal thought as she lifted her teacup. But still very negative. The farmhouse queen did have a lot of issues emotionally and probably needed more help than she'd admit.</p><p>She had learned that Shaundra wasn't the kind of person to burden someone else with her problems. She just kept it all bottled up inside and just toned it out or fainted when it became too much. Like the coma. What had she seen that was so frightening that rendered her unconscious for four months? And Shaundra still had a big decision to make about her marriage, which wasn't getting any easier the closer she got to delivering. Do you stay with a man because you love him and you're miserable? Or do you leave and save both of you from grief?</p><p>The sound of the front door opened, ending any further conversations between them. The gang entered the kitchen looking tired and messed up emotionally.</p><p>\"I better get breakfast started,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>\"It's already done,\" Shaundra replied as Ichiro kissed her on the top of her head.</p><p>\"You cooked?\" Takumijo asked sitting down at the table.</p><p>\"I'm perfectly capable of cooking,\" Shaundra told him rising. \"I've been cooking long before any of you were born.\"</p><p>She struggled to get to her feet. Shaundra had gained more weight since she entered her third trimester and her legs and feet looked swollen.</p><p>Cristal sprang to her feet to help her. \"I'll serve them,\" she volunteered.</p><p>Ichiro grabbed the other side of Shaundra. \"I'll serve them, he said. \"It is my responsibility.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" Shaundra said once she was on her feet. \"I'm going back to bed. I don't feel well.\"</p><p>\"What's wrong?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"I'm just tired,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>Cristal smirked. Point well taken, Ms. Yoshida. There was more than one way to get a man's attention and wrap him around your finger. Maybe she should have consulted Shaundra before going to California. Had she, maybe Yi-jun would have paid more attention to her.</p><p>\"Your legs are swollen,\" Ichiro told his wife. \"Are you staying away from the salt?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Shaundra answered. \"It's from these two big-head babies you've planted inside of me. They're transitioning to move into delivery mode, so they're pressing on my bladder and playing havoc on my lower back. And they are constant hungry, so I'm constantly eating.\"</p><p>\"Let me help you upstairs,\" Ichiro said like an obedient puppy. He led his wife out of the dining room and took her upstairs while the others remained behind.</p><p>\"How is she?\" Cristal asked Satoshi once they were alone.</p><p>She didn't like Amaya but she didn't wish her dead.</p><p>\"She is awake,\" Masaaki answered from him. \"But it's too soon to know what type of damage has been done.\"</p><p>\"And Yori?\"</p><p>\"A mess,\" Masaaki replied. \"He blames himself for his wife's stupidity.\"</p><p>Cristal sipped her tea. Where had she heard that line before? Masaaki sounded a bit like Shaundra.</p><p>\"I don't think we'll be seeing Yori for a while.\"</p><p>\"What about rehearsal for the tour?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"Yori is a professional. He will be perfect with or without rehearsal.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure he'll even make the tour?\" Cristal asked. She needed to know just in case she had to do some last minute changes to their publicity.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Masaaki answered her. \"Like Ichiro, he knows his responsibilities. What can he do for Amaya but sit by her side and hold her hand.\"</p><p>Sometimes that helps, Cristal thought.</p><p>\"He can't fix her problem,\" Masaaki continued. \"Only she can do this.\"</p><p>Ichiro reentered the dining room, grabbed an apron from the shelf, and walked through the doors that led to the kitchen. Everyone followed him with their eyes.</p><p>\"He's feeling guilty for what he said to Amaya that night,\"</p><p>Satoshi said.</p><p>\"He shouldn't feel that way,\" Cristal replied. \"I would have told her the same thing.\"</p><p>\"He still feels guilty for defending his wife.\"</p><p>\"Ich would have punched Amaya's lights out if she had struck Shaundra,\" Takumijo told her. \"He has never hit a woman before, but for Shaundra he would have done so.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Cristal gasped.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Satoshi said. \"His wife is pregnant and defenseless.</p><p>In Ichiro's world he thinks he has to protect her.\"</p><p>She didn't know if she considered Shaundra defenseless.</p><p>She could have handled Amaya with her wit and cutting remarks. \"Well, I'm glad they didn't have to resort to violence,\" Cristal said. \"Now all we have to do is pray for Amaya's full recovery.\"</p><p>Takumijo snorted. \"This from a woman who was about to pull Amaya's hair out from the roots a couple of days ago.\"</p><p>\"She's annoying,\" Cristal said in her own defense. \"But I don't want her dead. We are family after all.\"</p><p>Ichiro came out of the kitchen with the food and served everyone including himself. He didn't say much like he had a lot on his mind and not necessarily Amaya.</p><p>\"Find the seamstress,\" Masaaki shouted at Takumijo one day before the benefit concert. \"Yori's costume isn't fitting him correctly.\"</p><p>Takumijo looked over at Yori. He had lost some weight, and his pants for his stage costume sagged in the butt.</p><p>\"I can't have him going on stage looking anything less than perfect,\" Masaaki continued like a mother hen.</p><p>Takumijo left the room and found their seamstress. She was busy taking out the sleeves to Ichiro's costume. Unlike Yori, Ichiro had been hitting the gym hard lately, trying to work out some frustrations and his muscles were bulging out of his shirts. \"Masaaki needs you,\" he told the older woman who'd been costuming them since they were kids. \"Yori's costume is too big.\"</p><p>\"Send Yori to me,\" the woman said. \"Does Masaaki think I'm going to put this sewing machine on my back and come altar Yori's clothing?\" She finished up with Ichiro. \"No more weight training until after the tour,\" she told him. \"I've already started on your wardrobe and I can't spend all my time letting out seams.\"</p><p>\"Yes, Mrs. Ito,\" Ichiro said to the seamstress. He shrugged out of the shirt.</p><p>Takumijo ran his gaze over Ichiro's bare upper body. He found the younger man tone, muscular and without an ounce of fat. Ichiro had also slimmed down at the sides and sported some serious abs. Takumijo gushed with pride and a little desire. Ichiro's body almost looked as good as his.</p><p>\"Stop staring and take a picture,\" Ichiro told him as he put his shirt on.</p><p>\"You know you've always been my favorite,\" Takumijo teased.</p><p>\"Yeah, lucky me,\" Ichiro said sarcastically. \"A pretty-boy dancer has the hots for me.\"</p><p>Takumijo winked at him and walked out of the costume room. He headed back to Masaaki and sent Yori into the seamstress. He noticed how pale Yori had become when he passed him. His skin had a yellow tinge to it like he hadn't been eating or sleeping properly.</p><p>Amaya was out of the hospital, but instead of going to her parents home to recover like everyone assumed, Yori had brought her home to their place and had been taking care of her. By doing so he was neglecting his own health. He even needed a haircut. Takumijo made a mental note to talk to Satoshi about this. If anyone could get Yori back on his feet, Satoshi could.</p><p>Masaaki had moved on to inspect Kenshin's costume for the benefit, while Satoshi flipped through a magazine waiting for his turn.</p><p>\"You look great in this costume,\" Masaaki told Kenshin.</p><p>\"Are you bringing your girlfriend to the benefit concert?\"</p><p>\"Yes, she is off from work on that night. She's looking forward to finally seeing me perform.\"</p><p>\"Can I see you outside for a moment?\" Takumijo asked Satoshi.</p><p>Satoshi looked at him, rose and followed Takumijo out of the room.</p><p>\"What's up?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"Yori,\" Takumijo replied.</p><p>\"What about him?\"</p><p>\"Have you noticed how much weight he's lost? And I don't think he's been sleeping.\"</p><p>\"I have noticed,\" Satoshi said. \"His skin isn't perfect any more. And he needs a haircut.\"</p><p>Takumijo nodded. \"Do you think you can talk to him and find out where he's at?\"</p><p>\"You mean, see if he's emotionally stable?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Takumijo said.</p><p>\"Well, he's never exactly been that stable, but I know what you mean. I'll speak with him as soon as Mrs. Ito is finished with him.\"</p><p>Ichiro walked past them. Both Satoshi and Takumijo followed him with their eyes.</p><p>\"Is it my imagination or is Ichiro's muscles getting bigger?\"</p><p>Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"Not your imagination,\" Takumijo said. \"I just saw him with his shirt off. He's looking sweet.\"</p><p>\"Is he taking any kind of steroids?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"No, I don't think so,\" Takumijo replied. \"You know Ich; he doesn't like things like that. He's a naturalist.\"</p><p>\"Looks to me like he's been spending a lot of time working out. When does he find the time?\"</p><p>Takumijo shrugged. \"He's going to be beating the women off him.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I didn't say anything but that young waitress at his restaurant has me worried.\"</p><p>\"Eri?\" Takumijo asked.</p><p>\"Yes, that the one. She's after Ich. I could see it in her smile and in her walk.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, I noticed it too. But Ich won't touch that. He has too much to lose.\"</p><p>\"I don't know, Satoshi said. \"You heard what he said.</p><p>Everything has changed. Maybe he meant himself.\"</p><p>\"Ichiro would never cheat on Shaundra,\" Takumijo insisted. \"He knows she will leave his ass high and dry and probably for good this time.\"</p><p>\"I'm sure you're right,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>Yori came out of the alteration room.</p><p>Takumijo bowed and left the two of them.</p><p>\"Can we talk?\" Satoshi asked Yori.</p><p>\"Sure what about?\"</p><p>\"You,\" Satoshi said. \"Tak is worried about you.\"</p><p>\"I'm okay,\" Yori said. \"I'm just tired.\"</p><p>\"Are you still taking care of Amaya?\"</p><p>Yori nodded. \"I am her husband. She needs me.\"</p><p>\"Then you need to take care of yourself. You need to eat, and you could use a haircut.\"</p><p>Yori touched his hair. It was now down past his shoulders.</p><p>\"It's getting as long as Ich.\"</p><p>\"Yeah. We only need one pretty boy in the group. It's sort of his thing...not yours.\"</p><p>Yori chuckled weakly. \"He sent Amaya flowers. That was nice of him.\"</p><p>Satoshi shrugged. \"He loves her in his own special way.</p><p>We all do, that's why we need you to take care of yourself.</p><p>You need to be strong for her.\" He paused. \"Have you talked to her about what happened?\"</p><p>Yori shook his head. \"What is there to talk about? We both know what she did and why she did it. I should have thought about her feelings and not done some of the things I did. I wish I could take it back, but I can't.\"</p><p>\"Are you still in love with Shaundra?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>Yori looked away. \"I have convinced myself that it will never happen between her and me. She is married to Ich and carrying his babies. I still love her, but I know it's over between us. I love my wife and I plan to spend the rest of my life proving that to her.\"</p><p>Poor Yori. Satoshi patted him on the shoulder. \"I'm glad,\"</p><p>he said. \"Hopefully the two of you can get past this.\" He headed out of the room.</p><p>\"What about you?\" Yori asked. \"Are you still in love with Shaundra?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Satoshi said. \"But I am content at the moment just to be one of her dear friends.\"</p><p>Amaya still wasn't well enough to attend the benefit concert, which didn't bother Shaundra. She got dressed in a sexy, black after-five maternity outfit Ichiro had purchased for her for the occasion, and she wasn't going to let anything spoil her evening. The men had all gone ahead because they had to get in one more rehearsal before the show, and Cristal had volunteered to drive her to the benefit hall.</p><p>Cristal looked precious in a navy blue after five that brought out the blush in her cheeks and made her eyes twinkle. Yi-jun was such a fool to have passed up this rare gem.</p><p>\"How did you doctor's visit go?\" Cristal asked as she maneuvered her car through the crowded streets.</p><p>\"He says I'm fine and the babies are healthy. He's thinking about admitting me in the hospital next month.\"</p><p>\"But that's a month early,\" Cristal said. \"Are you having complications?\"</p><p>\"No, he seems to think that I am carrying two very large babies.\"</p><p>Cristal chuckled. \"Has he met their father? I swear I think he's getting taller and more muscular since I've met him.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, I noticed it too. It's like he's still a growing boy.\"</p><p>\"Daichi is pretty tall too,\" Cristal said.</p><p>\"Yes. If it wasn't for the eyes, they could pass for twins.\"</p><p>\"You think so?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" Shaundra said. \"I noticed the resemblance when I met him.\"</p><p>\"Well, that just blows Takumijo's theory that Ichiro could be an alien?\"</p><p>\"What?\"</p><p>\"Because of his eye color. He said aliens place Ichiro in the Yoshida family and took the real Yoshida baby.\"</p><p>Shaundra laughed. She hadn't done that in a while and one of the babies kicked her in the ribs. \"Ouch,\" she said, rubbing the spot. \"This kid is going to be a star soccer player.\"</p><p>Cristal sighed. \"What's it like carrying another life inside of you.\"</p><p>\"It's the most beautifully thing in the world,\" Shaundra said. \"And also the most frightening. You're responsible for another life and you have to do everything you can to get them safely into the world. It's a big responsibility. Why? Are you feeling maternal?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Cristal said. \"I was just wondering. Are you still upset that you're pregnant?\"</p><p>\"No. I got over that a while ago. I'm actually looking forward to the births. But I'm not looking forward to raising them alone.\"</p><p>Cristal got on the highway and merged into traffic. \"You won't be alone, honey. You have Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"Do I?\" Shaundra asked. \"He says he's going to be there to help. And I'm sure he's going to try, but I'm not holding my breath. Taking care of babies is an eighteen-year commitment that I don't think he's prepared for.\"</p><p>\"Do you think he might leave you when the going gets rough?\"</p><p>\"He's already left me mentally,\" Shaundra said. \"He's not the same Ichiro I married. He's grown now and has so many responsibilities with Aomori and the restaurants.\"</p><p>\"But you're his wife.\"</p><p>\"Only in America,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>\"Huh?\"</p><p>\"He never registered our marriage here.\"</p><p>\"How do you know that?\"</p><p>\"Why do you think no one could find me for four months?</p><p>The hospital tried to find my family through records, but no one had heard of a Shaundra Yoshida.\" She chuckled weakly.</p><p>\"I didn't even know he had to register our marriage here and I wouldn't have known until Daichi mentioned the christening.</p><p>I went to the registration office to find out what was needed for the babies and that's when I found out that our marriage needed to be registered.\"</p><p>\"Do you think he forgot?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"How do you forget something like that?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"So why do you supposed he hasn't done it yet?\"</p><p>Shaundra shrugged. \"Let's keep this between you and me.\"</p><p>\"I promise,\" Cristal said. \"Do you think Ich didn't register your marriage because he thinks you're after his money?\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"I don't need his money. I've done pretty well for myself all these years. I've made some wise investments and I'll never have to work again in my life if I don't want to. If he was worried about that, he should have made me sign a prenuptial agreement. Only Ich knows why he didn't do it.\"</p><p>\"So, what's going to happen when it comes time to register the babies? I know it doesn't matter in the United States, but here people will start to ask questions. How can these babies be considered legitimate if there's no proof that the parents are married?\"</p><p>\"I have no idea,\" Shaundra said. \"I'm just going to play this by ear and hope Ichiro knows what he's doing.\"</p><p>Cristal drove onto a parking lot and found an empty spot.</p><p>She turned off the car. \"Well, we better get inside. The others are expecting us.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded, removed her seatbelt, and opened the car door. \"Let's get this show on the road since this may be the last time I see Aomori perform for a while.\" She stepped out and closed the door.</p><p>Cristal got out and set the alarm on the car. \"This place is packed,\" she said as they walked toward the front door.</p><p>They handed their tickets to the man at the door and walked inside the hall.</p><p>\"Look at the people,\" Shaundra said as they passed a huge billboard with Aomori on it. \"They've all come to see Aomori and hopefully they will dig into their pockets and contribute for this worthy cause.\"</p><p>\"This was a lovely idea,\" Cristal said as they walked through the crowded lobby and entered the main ballroom.</p><p>\"I'm glad you thought of it.\"</p><p>They found their table. Masaaki waved them over.</p><p>\"Who is that woman sitting next to Masaaki?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"His girlfriend,\" Cristal told her. \"I heard she's rich.\"</p><p>\"She's very pretty,\" Shaundra said.</p><p>They arrived at the table. There were two other women present that Shaundra did not recognize. Masaaki made the introductions.</p><p>\"Ladies, this is my date, Hiromi Inoue, and Kaede Shimiju, Kenshin's date for the evening, and Amaterasu Yamaguchi a friend of Takumijo.\"</p><p>\"What? No date for Satoshi?\" Cristal asked as they shook hands with the women. \"Hi,\" I'm Cristal Gentry, Aomori's publicist, and this is Shaundra Yoshida, Ichiro's wife.\"</p><p>The gazes of three women went directly to Shaundra's stomach.</p><p>\"When are you due?\" Kaede asked Shaundra.</p><p>\"In two months,\" Shaundra said as she sat down.</p><p>\"You're huge.\"</p><p>Shaundra smiled at the woman. \"We're expecting twins.\"</p><p>\"Congratulations,\" Hiromi told her. \"Masaaki has told me so much about you.\"</p><p>\"Don't believe everything you hear,\" Shaundra said. \"I'm really not that bad.\"</p><p>The three women chuckled at her joke.</p><p>Cristal sat down. They kept the conversation light as Shaundra looked the three women over and wondered what life would be like in future now that the rest of the fellows had found mates. Maybe everyone would finally get out of her business and get a life.</p><p>The life dimmed and the show began. An MC took the stage and made a few announcements about the benefit, thanking everyone for their cooperation and their contributions. Aomori finally appeared to perform and for the next two hours they did a medley of their songs and joked and got the audience to participate in skits, similar to what they did at larger concerts. After the show, the men joined them at the table. Masaaki introduced the women to the rest of the group and Ichiro finally came and sat down next to her.</p><p>People got out of their seats and walked around speaking to friends or to use the restroom.</p><p>\"Good evening, Mrs. Yoshida.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked around, smiled, and rose to her feet.</p><p>\"Keiichi?\" she squealed. \"You made it.\" She put one of her arms around him and hugged him. Ichiro touched her other hand.</p><p>Shaundra released Keiichi. \"Ich, there's someone I want you to meet.\"</p><p>Ichiro rose, still clutching her hand possessively.</p><p>\"This is Keiichi Wantanabe. The man who saved my life during the hurricane.\"</p><p>Ich tightened his grip as he extended his other hand to Keiichi. \"It is nice to meet you. Thank you for looking my wife through such a difficult time.\"</p><p>Keiichi shook Ichiro's hand. \"It was my pleasure, Mr.</p><p>Yoshida.\"</p><p>\"Please, call me Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"And this is my mother.\" Keiichi pulled the tiny woman forward.</p><p>Ichiro finally let loose of her hand, took Mrs. Wantanabe's hand and kissed it. \"It is nice to meet you too, Mrs.</p><p>Watanabe. You should be very proud of your son. He risked his life to save my wife during the earthquake. If it wasn't for him she would have died.\"</p><p>The older woman giggled. \"I can't believe it. You're Ichiro Yoshida of Aomori.\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked. It appeared like she wasn't the only cougar in Ichiro's fan club. The older women looked positively smitten with him.</p><p>\"I just didn't believe it when Keiichi told me what he'd done, but I would expect no less of him. He has a kind heart and always put others before himself.\"</p><p>\"Yes, he's quite special,\" Shaundra admitted. \"He talked to me and kept me sane during the earthquake. He even used his body to shield me from the fallen debris.\"</p><p>\"I couldn't let anything happen to you. You were my patient and so tiny. And you didn't have anyone there to protect you,\" Keiichi said. \"I'm just glad that I was there.\"</p><p>Shaundra introduced him to the others.</p><p>\"I already know Satoshi,\" Keiichi said, shaking the pianist hand. \"We met at the hospital.\"</p><p>\"What hospital?\" Ichiro asked.</p><p>\"Never mind about all that,\" Shaundra said. \"Would the two of you care to join us?\"</p><p>\"No thank you,\" Keiichi said. \"I have to get Mother home.</p><p>It's getting late. It was an honor just to be invited. You guys put on a terrific show.\" He turned back to Shaundra. \"I just came over to thank you for the tickets. No one is going to believe I was here.\"</p><p>\"Do you have you cell phone?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"Sure,\" Keiichi said, digging it out of his pocket. \"Why?\"</p><p>\"I think Aomori won't mind posing with you for a picture.</p><p>That will be all the proof you need.\"</p><p>The five members of Aomori rose and surrounded Keiichi and his mother and posed for several photos taken by Shaundra.</p><p>She handed the phone back to Keiichi.</p><p>Keiichi looked down at the picture, excited like a child.</p><p>\"Thank you,\" he said. \"I will always treasure this.\" He fiddled with the camera, aimed it at Shaundra and took her picture.</p><p>\"What did you do that for?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"You're a world-famous writer and a very beautiful young woman. My friends will be so envious.\"</p><p>Shaundra tiptoed and kissed Keiichi on the cheek. \"You're so kind. Thank you again. For everything.\"</p><p>Keiichi blushed. \"I will see you at the hospital,\" he told her.</p><p>He pulled out a business card and handed it to her. \"Call me when they admit you. I will make sure that they take good care of you and the babies.\"</p><p>Shaundra accepted the card and nodded. \"Will do,\" she said.</p><p>Keiichi and his mother bowed and walked away.</p><p>Shaundra sat down and put the card into her purse.</p><p>\"Why do you need to call him?\" Ichiro asked as he sat back down next to him. \"You didn't tell me that he was so good- looking or so tall.\"</p><p>\"It's out of common courtesy,\" Shaundra said to his first question, and ignoring the comment about Keiichi. \"The man saved my life and our babies lives. I guess he just want to make sure they are safely delivered into the world without incident.\"</p><p>Ichiro gave her the strangest look. \"Okay, if you say so.\"</p><p>Shaundra sighed. What is eating him?</p><p>Harper and made his way over to the table with Mr.</p><p>Niigata.</p><p>\"They're just coming out of the woodworks,\" Ichiro nodded.</p><p>Shaundra shook her head. Why is he being this way?</p><p>\"Shaundra, darling,\" Harpers said, bending over and kissing her on the cheek. \"You're looking ravishing.\"</p><p>\"I look like a moo cow,\" Shaundra told her boss. \"But thanks for the compliment. When did you get here?\"</p><p>He spoke to the others at the table. \"Right before the show began. Aomori was fantastic, as usual. How are you doing, Ichiro?\"</p><p>\"Fine,\" Ichiro answered.</p><p>Shaundra shook her head, ignoring her husband's juvenile behavior.</p><p>\"Can I borrow your lovely wife for a moment? There's something I need to discuss with her.\"</p><p>\"Sure,\" Ichiro said. \"Take as long as you want.\" He got out of his seat and walked away.</p><p>Harper helped her out of the seat. \"What's wrong with him?\"</p><p>\"Growing pains,\" Shaundra said as she followed him away from the table and out of the ballroom. They ended up outside. \"What's up?\"</p><p>\"Nothing. I just wanted to see you and to see how you're doing.\"</p><p>Shaundra leaned against the railing. \"I'm okay. The babies are fine too, but I think my marriage is falling apart.\"</p><p>Harper leaned next to her. \"Don't tell me things that might get me excited. What's wrong now?\"</p><p>\"My husband doesn't believe that he's the father of these babies.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Harper asked. \"Who does he think the father is?\"</p><p>\"You,\" Shaundra replied.</p><p>\"Oh, no wonder he looked at me like he wanted to strangle me. I'm flattered, but we both know that isn't true.\"</p><p>\"Don't be flattered. Ichiro has a black belt in several martial arts. He probably could kill both of us with one kick.\"</p><p>\"Why would he think something like that?\"</p><p>\"Because of something Amaya said to him when I returned.\"</p><p>\"Speaking of the dragon, how is she doing? Mr. Niigata told me what happened.\"</p><p>\"She's recovering,\" Shaundra said.</p><p>\"Do you know what happened?\"</p><p>\"Same story. She came over to the farmhouse and tried to pick a fight with me. Yori defended me and snapped at her.</p><p>Stupid man. So she went home and tried to commit suicide with an antidepressant and slit her wrists.\"</p><p>\"Ouch. Talk about drama. He's still not over you yet, I see.\"</p><p>\"That's his problem,\" Shaundra said. \"He should get over me. It would make all our lives much easier.\"</p><p>Harper wrapped his arm around her shoulder. \"I don't know why everyone thinks that you are a loose woman.\"</p><p>\"I don't know why either. I just wish Ichiro would just trust me.\"</p><p>\"Doesn't he know how dangerous it is for you to be pregnant at this time in your life?\"</p><p>\"No, I don't think he does. I think it's all getting to be a little too much for him. Maybe going on tour might be what's best for both of us. If the marriage can withstand another separation, things will be fine.\"</p><p>\"You don't believe that do you?\" Harper asked.</p><p>\"No,\" Shaundra admitted.</p><p>\"You know I will be there for you no matter how this turns out,\" Harper said.</p><p>Shaundra rested her head against his chest. \"I know. If something should happen to me. You know. If I don't survive the delivery, I want you to promise me that you will take my babies and my body back to the United States.\"</p><p>Harper pulled away from her. \"What are you saying?\"</p><p>\"I want my family to see to my babies. Ichiro won't be able to do it, and I sure don't want other woman raising my kids.\"</p><p>\"Is there something wrong?\" Harper asked.</p><p>\"No, but we both know there is a possibility that something might happen. I want you to promise me.\"</p><p>\"I promise,\" Harper said. \"But I might have a fight on my hands. The babies will be Japanese citizens as soon as they're born. Ichiro won't let them go so easily.\"</p><p>\"You have more clout than a twenty-five-year-old,\"</p><p>Shaundra told him.</p><p>\"And I'm probably better in bed,\" Harper said.</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"No comment.\"</p><p>Satoshi snuck away from the front door like a common criminal. Maybe Ichiro didn't care what went on with Shaundra and Harper but he did. And boy did he just get an earful. He hurried back into the ballroom just in time to unfortunately run into Osamu.</p><p>\"What are you doing here?\" Satoshi asked the man.</p><p>Osamu bowed and smiled at him. \"I came to see you guys perform,\" Osamu said straightening his very fashionable royal blue and black suit jacket down over a pair of black trousers.</p><p>\"Do you have a problem with this? I got through with my scenes early and thought I'd drop by to show my support.\"</p><p>\"No,\" Satoshi said. \"Takumijo didn't tell me you were coming?\"</p><p>\"Does Tak tell you everything about us?\"</p><p>\"No, thankfully,\" Satoshi said. Some secrets he just didn't want to know about.</p><p>\"Who is that lovely young woman seated beside him?\"</p><p>\"His date,\" Satoshi replied.</p><p>\"Oh, he's dating again?\"</p><p>\"Apparently,\" Satoshi said. \"She's some dancer he met at a club.\"</p><p>Osamu made a face. \"He does have the most peculiar tastes in companions.\"</p><p>Satoshi chuckled. \"Yes, he does.\"</p><p>Osamu stepped back and looked him over. \"You're looking quite kawaii tonight. That color goes well with your complexion.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" Satoshi said. Osamu always made him a bit nervous with the flattery.</p><p>\"Are you also here with a date?\"</p><p>\"Not really. I've kind of left the dating scene for a while.\"</p><p>\"Oh, why?\"</p><p>\"I'm too busy. We're preparing for another tour.\"</p><p>\"Yes, Tak did mention it. Europe?\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"We'll be gone a couple of months.\"</p><p>\"Well, luckily Takumijo has wrapped up his part in the drama or that might have caused some problems.\"</p><p>\"Takumijo knows what he's doing. Aomori comes first in his life before acting.\"</p><p>\"Yes, he's made himself very clear on that,\" Osamu said.</p><p>\"Too bad I will be busy filming in the United States for the next couple of months or I might have to drop everything I'm doing to visit him in Europe.\"</p><p>Satoshi frowned. \"He'll be too busy to run off and go clubbing with you. He has responsibilities.\"</p><p>\"You say clubbing like it's a bad thing. Takumijo and I are boyhood friends. We do almost everything together. Clubbing just happens to be our thing.\"</p><p>Satoshi was very aware how close Takumijo and Osamu were. It was almost a strangling situation.</p><p>\"You should join us sometime,\" Osamu suggested.</p><p>\"No thanks,\" Satoshi said. \"I'm much too busy.\"</p><p>Osamu turned and began walking away.</p><p>\"Aren't you going in and say hello to Takumijo?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Osamu said. \"I think I'll congratulate him tonight when I see him.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" Satoshi said. That meant Takumijo would probably be coming home wasted again.</p><p>\"Give the others my love,\" Osamu told Satoshi.</p><p>\"Will do,\" Satoshi replied and he stepped back inside the ballroom.</p><p>\"Did you find Ichiro?\" Masaaki asked him when he approached the table.</p><p>\"No, I was using the men's room,\" Satoshi lied.</p><p>\"Well, go find him. It's time to leave.\"</p><p>Satoshi bowed and headed off in the direction he last saw Ichiro. Shaundra and Harper reentered the ballroom just as he walked away. The two of them were smiling and chatting happily with each other. Satoshi frowned, not liking what he saw or what he'd overheard. That relationship was too comfortable. They acted more like best friends instead of boss and employee. She seemed relaxed in his company like she trusted him. Apparently she did if she wanted him to see to her babies if she died. Satoshi clutched his chest, hoping that wouldn't happen. Where the hell is Ichiro?</p><p>Keiichi Wantanabe's appearance had been a surprised to everyone, especially him. He'd had no idea that Shaundra had got in contact with the man. He had planned to take her to see him, but apparently she decided that she didn't need an escort, which led him to believe that Shaundra had something to hide. He wondered what really went on during those chaotic moments of the earthquake and the tsunami. What did Shaundra see that knocked her out with fear? Why did Keiichi seem determined to keep her from remembering?</p><p>Satoshi looked around the back offices of the benefit hall but did not see him. He was just about to head back when he heard Ichiro's voice.</p><p>\"I cannot get away now,\" Satoshi told someone. \"I have to make sure that my wife gets home safely.\"</p><p>Who is he speaking with? Satoshi waited to hear another voice.</p><p>\"Yes, I want to see you too.\"</p><p>He's on the phone. Who is he speaking to?</p><p>\"I will see what I can do. I'll call you later if I can get out.\"</p><p>Satoshi hurried away from the room and headed back to the main ballroom. It sounded like Ichiro was making a date or something for later.</p><p>Masaaki and the others had already left the ballroom, he discovered once he entered. He turned to leave and nearly ran into Ichiro. \"We've been looking for you,\" Satoshi told him \"Where have you been?\"</p><p>\"Out,\" Ichiro said. \"I needed to get some air.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" Satoshi said, recognizing a lie when he heard one.</p><p>\"Shaundra and the others are outside preparing to leave.\"</p><p>\"Then we better go too,\" Ichiro said turning on his heels.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\" Satoshi asked him as they walked out of the ballroom and headed toward the lobby.</p><p>\"Yes, why?\" Ichiro asked as they walked.</p><p>\"Are you upset that Harper came over to speak with Shaundra?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Ichiro said. \"She can speak to whomever she wants to.\"</p><p>Satoshi caught the hurt in his voice.</p><p>\"He's her boss,\" Satoshi said. \"They have a bond.\"</p><p>\"She is my wife,\" Ichiro said. \"Her only bond is with me.\"</p><p>Yes, he's upset, and he's probably about to do something stupid that may jeopardize his future with her. \"She loves you.\"</p><p>\"She has a poor way of showing it, hugging and kissing strange men. It's embarrassing.\"</p><p>\"It's an American thing to do,\" Satoshi told him. \"And, besides, the man saved her life. Of course she's going to have a special place in her heart for him. That's just Shaundra.</p><p>She's a very affectionate and caring person.\"</p><p>\"How come you know so much about my wife?\" Ichiro asked as they walked outside and started down the steps.</p><p>\"Because I sit around and I observe.\"</p><p>Ichiro rolled his eyes at him. \"A man can only take so much.\"</p><p>What does that mean? \"Don't do anything foolish.\"</p><p>\"I know what I'm doing,\" Ichiro said. \"You don't have to worry about me.\" He entered the limousine.</p><p>I certainly hope so. Satoshi entered behind him and Kenshin closed the door.</p><p>Later that night Satoshi watched Ichiro leave the farmhouse. It was very late at night and Shaundra was probably fast asleep. He sighed and walked away from the window. Ichiro is an idiot. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shaundra rolled over in the bed expecting to feel Ichiro next to her, but he wasn't there. She opened her eyes. His side of the bed was still made, which meant she'd slept alone.</p><p>Again. She sighed. She snuck out again. She noticed he'd been doing this a lot lately. Maybe he couldn't sleep, or maybe he had things on his mind that he couldn't discuss with her. But everything indicated that he was up to no good.</p><p>She sighed again. At this rate he was making the decision easier for her.</p><p>Shaundra got out of the bed and got dressed. She had a busy day planned. First she had to have some tests done at the hospital, then she had to drive over to KiNii for an interview, and finally she was meeting Hana and Etsuko for lunch at Ichiro's restaurant. Her sister-in-laws had wanted to visit with her at the farmhouse, but Shaundra wanted an outing since she'd probably be confined to a bed in the next couple of weeks.</p> <p>Shaundra found Satoshi, Takumijo, and Cristal in the dining room when she finally made it down the stairs.</p><p>Takumijo looked like he'd been out all night and was having problems staying awake at the table. \"Good morning,\" she said to get their attention.</p><p>\"Good morning,\" the three of them said to her.</p><p>Shaundra put her briefcase and purse down in a chair.</p><p>\"What are you doing all dressed up?\" Cristal asked.</p> <p>\"I've got places to go and people to meet,\" Shaundra replied. \"I just stopped in for a cup of tea before I leave.\"</p><p>Satoshi hopped up and helped her into a seat. \"Aren't you going to eat breakfast with us? Ichiro has been busy in the kitchen all morning.\"</p><p>Great cover up, Shaundra thought. Now tell me where he's been all night. If anyone knew anything, Satoshi did. \"No, just tea. I have some tests to take at the hospital and all I can have is liquids.\"</p><p>\"Is Ichiro accompanying you to take these tests?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"No,\" Shaundra said. \"I'm going alone.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" Satoshi asked as he poured her some tea. \"Why isn't he accompanying you?\"</p> <p>\"Probably since he doesn't know I'm going,\" Shaundra replied. \"I am a big girl, and I can do things by myself.\"</p><p>\"I suppose,\" Satoshi said. \"But I would feel a lot better if you'd take Ichiro with you.\"</p><p>\"I'll be okay,\" Shaundra said, well aware that they were trying to pry into her business. \"I'm getting pretty good at driving myself around. I'm used to doing things for myself.\"</p><p>Ichiro entered the dining room with a cartload of food.</p><p>\"What are you doing up?\" he asked her. \"You should be resting.\" He began unloading the food on the table.</p><p>\"I'm tired of resting,\" Shaundra said, looking over at her.</p><p>He had on regular clothes, which meant he had the decency to shower and change before he flew the house in the wee hours of the morning.</p><p>\"What would you like to eat?\" he asked.</p> <p>\"Nothing for me,\" Shaundra said. \"I'm on my way out.\"</p><p>Ichiro finally looked at her. \"Where?\"</p><p>\"Doctor's appointment.\"</p><p>He didn't say anything. He just continued to serve the others. Of course the others were listening to the conversations and waiting for him to say something. \"Oh,\" he finally said. He rolled the cart back toward the kitchen and disappeared.</p><p>Shaundra ignored him, finished her tea and rose. \"See you guys later.\"</p><p>\"Would you like me to accompany you?\" Satoshi offered. \"I have a little free time before I leave for rehearsal.\"</p><p>\"No thanks,\" Shaundra said. \"I'm getting used to going by myself. And I have other plans for the rest of the day. Thanks anyway.\" She grabbed her briefcase and purse and headed to the front door. She found Ichiro on the porch when she exited. He must have slipped out of the kitchen door when he rolled the breakfast cart back.</p><p>\"You should have told me you had a doctor's appointment,\" he said angrily.</p><p>\"Why?\" Shaundra asked. \"You don't tell me everything that you do, and besides you have a rehearsal to attend.\"</p><p>\"But...\"</p><p>\"But what? Would you have called Mr. Niigata and told him that you couldn't make it to the rehearsal because you had to escort me to the doctor?\"</p><p>Ichiro didn't answer. He just looked at her like he wanted to say something but couldn't find the right words. \"No.\"</p><p>So not the right word. \"Exactly. That's why I didn't mention it.\"</p><p>\"I am your husband. It would be nice if you tried to remember that.\"</p><p>\"I am your wife and it would be nice to wake up next to you in the morning. You need to try and remember that.\"</p><p>Shaundra made an attempt to leave but Ichiro grabbed her arm. \"Where are you really going? You're too dressed up for a doctor's appointment.\"</p><p>Shaundra snatched her arm away. \"I have to stop at KiNii after my tests. I'm doing an interview for my new book.\"</p><p>\"Tests? What tests? Is something wrong with the babies?\"</p><p>\"Like you care,\" Shaundra said. \"No. I'm just having routine tests for preadmission.\" She walked down the steps and continued toward the back parking lot.</p><p>Ichiro caught up with her and grabbed her arm again.</p><p>\"What do you mean about me not caring? Of course I'm concerned about the state of those babies.\"</p><p>\"Let go of me.\" Shaundra pulled away from him. Ichiro didn't know his own strength, and she didn't want to have to explain black-and-blue marks to some technician. \"My babies are fine. They're just big and Doctor Sou thinks I won't be able to deliver them vaginally. I might need to have a Cesarean.\"</p><p>\"He will have to cut you?\" Confusion and concern showed on his face.</p><p>\"Yes, it will be okay. It's a common procedure. Women have Cesareans every day.\"</p><p>\"Don't do this, Shaundra,\" he said.</p><p>\"Do what?\"</p><p>\"Speak to me like a child. A Cesarean is not a common procedure. You could die during the process.\"</p><p>\"I can die having them naturally,\" Shaundra admitted.</p><p>\"Don't worry, because I'm not. I put my life in the Lord's hands a long time ago. Now go back inside and tend to your friends. They're probably worried about you.\"</p><p>Ichiro groaned. \"You are the most infuriating woman. I don't understand you most of the time. How can you be so casual about this?\"</p><p>\"How do you expect me to be? I am fifty-one and pregnant. My husband is twenty-five and a member of a famous pop group and is too busy with responsibilities to be a part of my life at the moment. You want me to beg and plead with you not to go on tour, but that's not going to happen.</p><p>What good will it do? You will still go because Mr. Niigata and Masaaki have your guys brainwashed to think that your music career is the most important thing in your life. So please don't play the dejected and hurt party here. I don't need you to go to the hospital with me, nor do I need you to be here with me for the births. I can do this by myself.\"</p><p>She walked away from him unlocked her Mercedes convertible. She tossed her briefcase and purse into the passenger seat angrily. Damn Ichiro. What did he care anyway? If he loved her, he would have registered their marriage instead of listening to others and believing she wasn't good enough to be a part of his family or thinking that she would cheat on him. She slid into the car and closed the door. She rolled down the window and started the engine.</p><p>Ichiro walked up beside the car. \"Will you be seeing Harper today?\"</p><p>\"Get away from my car,\" Shaundra told him. This jealousy thing was starting to irritate the hell out of her.</p><p>\"Don't go to him, Shaundra.\"</p><p>\"Oh, grow up. If I wanted to be with Harper I would be with him right now instead of playing mental games with you.</p><p>He is my boss and my friend. Nothing else.\" She put the car in reverse.</p><p>Ichiro stepped away from the car.</p><p>\"Have a nice day,\" she told him sarcastically as she continued to back out of the driveway. She drove off leaving him standing there sulking.</p><p>Ichiro walked back toward the farmhouse angry and frustrated. He saw the curtain close in one of the windows indicating that Satoshi and the others had witness their little argument. To hell with them, he thought. He knew that Shaundra was upset about him going on tour, but this was the first time she'd had mentioned how she really felt about it. Why didn't she understand that he had to do what he had to do to secure their future?</p><p>True, they weren't hurting for money, but he stood to make a lot on this tour. And he needed that to put aside for their babies. And then there was the house...their house in Kyoto. He'd already found the perfect spot and purchased it.</p><p>Ichiro walked up the stairs. He wasn't brainwashed. Why didn't she understand that he had signed a contract and couldn't get out of it for any reason? There was still one year on it, and after that he would be free. Surely she could wait that long.</p><p>Ichiro entered the kitchen and poured himself a cup of tea and walked into the dining room. Takumijo and the others just sat there, pretending that they didn't know that something was wrong.</p><p>\"Did Shaundra leave?\" Cristal asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>\"Maybe I should have volunteered to go with her,\" Cristal said.</p><p>\"No need,\" Ichiro told her. \"She doesn't need anyone to look out for her.\" He sat down at the table well aware that everyone expected him to say more.</p><p>\"She shouldn't be driving herself,\" Satoshi said. \"She does not know Osaka well enough. What if something happens?\"</p><p>\"The Lord will take care of her,\" Ichiro said absently. \"And Harper.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"Nothing. Don't pay me any mind. What time do we have to be at rehearsal today?\"</p><p>\"Eleven,\" Takumijo said.</p><p>\"I like Amaterasu,\" Ichiro said. \"She's a very lovely young woman and much better than your past choices for a companion.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" Takumijo said. \"I'll tell her.\"</p><p>\"Where did you meet her?\"</p><p>\"At a club. She's a backup dancer.\"</p><p>\"Oh, the two of you have something in common. That's nice. It's always good to have someone you can share a common interest with.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure you're okay?\" Satoshi asked him.</p><p>\"Yes, did you know that Shaundra may need to have a Cesarean?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Satoshi answered. \"Why would I know that?\"</p><p>\"The two of you are such good friends. I just figured she'd mention it to you. But apparently the babies are too big for her to have naturally. She told me not to worry.\" He chuckled weakly. \"How can I not worry?\" He sighed. \"Sometimes I do not understand her.\"</p><p>\"Maybe you should meet her at the hospital,\" Cristal suggested. \"She might be terrified and just too stubborn to let you see her that way.\"</p><p>\"No, she doesn't want me there. She wants to do this on her own.\"</p><p>\"But they're your babies too,\" Takumijo said.</p><p>\"So, she says.\" He got up with his cup in hand and strolled out of the dining room.</p><p>Yori was glad to see Amaya looking so much better this morning. The doctor had given her a clean bill of health and fortunately the drugs had not messed up any of her vital organs. \"How are you feeling?\"</p><p>\"Better,\" Amaya said.</p><p>\"Do you think you can get out of bed this morning and join me at the kitchen table for breakfast?\"</p><p>\"I think so,\" Amaya said. \"The doctor says I need to eat to regain my strength.\"</p><p>Like him, Amaya had lost some weight, which hopefully they both would put back on soon.</p><p>Amaya pushed back the covers and stepped from the bed.</p><p>A few seconds later she disappeared inside the bathroom. Yori had made sure all the pills and razors had been removed from the house before she was discharged from the hospital. She came out a few minutes later with a freshly scrubbed face and her hair pulled back in a ponytail.</p><p>Yori opened the closet. \"What would you like to wear?\"</p><p>\"I'm perfectly capable of dressing myself,\" Amaya said.</p><p>\"I know,\" Yori told her. \"I like taking care of you.\"</p><p>Amaya wrapped her arms around his waist. \"I know, and I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I think we need to talk.\" She took her arms from around him and sat down on the bed.</p><p>\"About what?\" Yori asked sitting down next to her.</p><p>\"About what happened.\"</p><p>\"Oh, if that is what you wish.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I think it is best.\"</p><p>\"Why did you do it?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"I have no idea,\" Amaya admitted. She sighed. \"I guess I was angry and jealous, and just basically stupid.\"</p><p>Yori reached over and patted her hand. \"Why didn't you tell me you were depressed? We've been friends for many years. I thought we talked about everything.\"</p><p>\"Not everything,\" Amaya said. \"I've been taking them for about two months now.\"</p><p>Yori nodded. Right around the time Shaundra returned.</p><p>\"What are you depressed about?\"</p><p>\"My life,\" she said.</p><p>\"You mean our marriage?\"</p><p>\"Yes and other things.\"</p><p>\"What other things?\" Yori asked.</p><p>\"Shaundra.\"</p><p>\"I married you,\" Yori said. \"And I'm sorry for being such a fool and teasing you. My infatuation with her ended when I said, 'I do' with you, and to set the record straight, I am not the father of her babies. We've never had sex, and she is in love with Ichiro.\"</p><p>\"But why did she disappear?\"</p><p>\"They were having problems, but it had nothing to do with me. Ichiro was neglecting Shaundra and they had this big argument. Shaundra didn't want to be a bother to Ichiro anymore because of her health and she planned to leave him so he could find someone else younger. Unfortunately the earthquake hit and she went into a comma, nothing else. She apparently was pregnant by Ich before she left and knew it.\"</p><p>\"So she was going to leave and raise the babies alone?\"</p><p>Amaya asked.</p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p>\"But how can you be sure that they are Ichiro's babies.\"</p><p>\"I can't, but I know Shaundra is not the kind of person to cheat. She's just a mother whose dedicated most of her life to taking care of her kids and who just wanted to have fun.</p><p>Unfortunately she got mixed up with us.\"</p><p>Amaya sighed. \"So I went through all this for nothing?\"</p><p>\"I'm afraid so. You have nothing to be worried about. I'm not going to leave you for her, and I plan to be a pain in your ass for many more years.\"</p><p>Amaya laid her head against him. \"Would you like to have a baby with me?\"</p><p>\"Someday,\" Yori said. \"But after we are more stable with our marriage and our careers. I'd like to have a son. Or maybe four so we can start a singing group.\"</p><p>\"No, you'll just need two. Shaundra will be supplying her two and we'll keep it in the family.\" She chuckled. \"So what's for breakfast?\"</p><p>\"Anything you want.\"</p><p>\"Waffles.\"</p><p>Yori kissed Amaya on the head. \"Waffles it is.\"</p><p>\"Do you think your stomach can stretch any further?\" Hana asked Shaundra as she entered Ichiro's restaurant. Hana wrapped her arms around her for a hug.</p><p>\"I don't know,\" Shaundra said. \"I feel like I'm about to burst.\"</p><p>Hana led her to a table and sat her near the window. \"I'll go tell Etsuko and Daichi that you are here.\"</p><p>Shaundra sat down and watched her sister-in-law walk away. She returned a few minutes later with her two other siblings in tow, and another young woman she didn't recognize. From the outfit Shaundra deduced that she was a waitress.</p><p>Daichi leaned over and kissed her on the head. \"It's good to see you again.</p><p>Etsuko slid into the booth next to her once Daichi moved.</p><p>She hugged her too. \"I'm so glad you've decided to come here for lunch.\"</p><p>\"Who is this?\" Shaundra asked about the pretty young woman with the long black hair and big brown eyes.</p><p>\"Where are my manners?\" Hana said. \"Shaundra, this is Eri, Eri, this is our sister-in-law, Shaundra. Ichiro's wife.\"</p><p>The young woman bowed and smiled. The smile did not reach her eyes. Shaundra remembered her now. She was the one who had smiled at Ichiro the last time they ate at the restaurant. \"It is nice to meet you Eri. Have you been working here long?\"</p><p>\"About six months,\" Eri replied.</p><p>\"Eri wants to be a chef,\" Daichi said. \"Ichiro has taken her under his wing and has been teaching her about cooking.\"</p><p>Was she imagining things, or was that a smirk on Eri's face. \"That's nice,\" Shaundra said smiling. She was sure the smile did not reach her eyes either. Ichiro hadn't mentioned that he'd been tutoring anyone. \"How often are your classes?\"</p><p>\"About once or twice a week,\" Eri answered. \"I know he's a busy man so I appreciate him taking the time out to help me.\"</p><p>\"Yes, my Ichiro is very helpful,\" Shaundra said. \"He's one of the best chefs in the business.\"</p><p>Eri handed then some menus. \"Please let me know what you would like to eat. I'll be back shortly with water and utensils.\" She walked away.</p><p>Shaundra watched the young woman leave, not impressed by her or fooled by her niceness. And she also wasn't foolish enough to eat anything she would prepare. \"I still have to watch my salt intake,\" Shaundra told Daichi. \"What would you suggest?\"</p><p>\"Lean beef and vegetables,\" Daichi answered. \"I will make sure that the chef prepares them himself without any assistance.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked up at him. He winked at her. Shaundra winked back. \"Thank you.\"</p><p>Daichi chuckled. \"You are very wise.\"</p><p>\"What are you two talking about?\" Etsuko asked.</p><p>\"Survival skills,\" Daichi answered. \"It's something that comes with maturity.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. She was beginning to like her brother- in-law a bit more. He had her back and knew what was going on, even if he was much too polite to just come out and tell her that Eri was after her husband.</p><p>Daichi left after Eri came back to take their orders, leaving the young women alone with Shaundra.</p><p>\"I heard that Ichiro is going back on the road,\" Etsuko said once her brother was out of ear range.</p><p>\"Yes, they're going to Europe for a couple of weeks.\"</p><p>\"It's a shame he will not be here to be with you,\" Hana said as she sipped her water. \"A husband's place is at his wife's side.\"</p><p>\"It would be nice,\" Shaundra said. \"But it is Ichiro's job. I knew it when I married him.\"</p><p>\"Well I'll try to visit as often as I can so you don't get lonely in that big farmhouse,\" Etsuko said.</p><p>\"Ichiro expects you to move in with us while he's gone,\"</p><p>Hana said.</p><p>\"He hasn't said anything to me about that,\" Shaundra said, not liking the idea. \"I'll be okay at the farmhouse. I'm comfortable there and I know how to cook.\"</p><p>\"I thought you might say that. Ichiro is just concerned about you,\" Hana said.</p><p>\"So is everyone. They think I'll die or something before they return.\" She chuckled. \"Sometimes they act like I'm a child...like I'm incapable of doing anything. I wonder how they think I survived before I met them.\"</p><p>\"I can understand how my brother feels a little,\" Hana replied. \"You do not know the language well enough to communicate with Japanese that do not speak English, and you don't know enough about Osaka to get around.\"</p><p>\"I made it here by myself didn't I? And I've been studying Japanese. I appreciate everyone's concern, but it's stifling. I have plenty of things to keep me company while he's gone, and it's not like he's home much anyway.\"</p><p>Etsuko looked over at her sister. \"He spent a lot of time here when you were gone.\"</p><p>This much she knew. \"He spent a lot of time here, before I left, honey. He's a businessman and at the time he was trying to get this restaurant up and running. Now he's doing it with his other restaurants. I'm just going to have to get used to it.\"</p><p>\"He's just trying to prepare a future for you and the babies,\" Hana said, like she had to defend Ichiro's actions.</p><p>\"And I appreciate it, but there is more to making a happy home than material things. But don't the two of you worry about us. Most couples go through similar things. It will all work out in the future.\"</p><p>\"Have you started working on the nursery?\" Etsuko asked.</p><p>\"Not yet,\" Shaundra said. \"We've been too busy.\"</p><p>\"But you only have a couple of weeks before you deliver.</p><p>What are you waiting on?\"</p><p>\"I plan to do it when guys go on the road. I'll have them move the furniture out the room before they leave and I can handle the rest.\"</p><p>\"Can I help?\" Hana asked. \"I like decorating.\"</p><p>\"Sure,\" Shaundra said. \"I'd love you to help. You can stop me from putting everything in blue.\"</p><p>\"Is that your favorite color?\" Hana asked.</p><p>\"Yes, but it's also a popular color for boys.\"</p><p>Hana put her elbows on the table and leaned forward. \"Are you having boys?\"</p><p>\"I have no idea,\" Shaundra said with a smirk. \"But I know that is what Aomori thinks.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean you have no idea? Didn't the doctor tell you?\"</p><p>\"He wanted to, but I like to be surprised.\"</p><p>\"Ooh, two little Ichiros,\" Etsuko said. \"They're going to be so adorable.\"</p><p>Shaundra could tell that Etsuko loved her brother. \"Yes, I supposed they will be. I think Masaaki and Mr. Niigata are always planning for a way to market them.\"</p><p>Hana laughed. \"Already. What if the kids have no talent?\"</p><p>\"I said the same thing,\" Shaundra said. \"But they're businessmen and the little wheels in their heads are turning and plotting.\"</p><p>Daichi and Eri came out with their food. Daichi placed Shaundra's in front of her. \"No salt, but spiced to taste.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\" Shaundra said in Japanese, looking down at the beef and vegetables.</p><p>Eri served Hana and Etsuko. \"Would you ladies need anything else?\" she asked.</p><p>\"No thank you,\" the three of them answered.</p><p>Eri and Daichi left them to their meal.</p><p>Shaundra picked up her chopsticks, broke them apart, and rubbed them together to get rid of any splinters. A chill ran through her. She looked toward the kitchen door. Eri was staring at her. Shaundra lowered her eyes and tried to ignore her.</p><p>It was just starting to turn dark when she finally go home and parked her car. After leaving the restaurant Shaundra stopped at an office supply store for some steno tablets and ink pens, and then she treated herself to new negligee. Both the limousine and the SUV were in their spots which meant everyone had returned from rehearsal. There was only one car missing now, Ichiro's. She got out of her car, locked it up and went into the farmhouse. She was too tired to be bothered with joining the others. She wanted to take a bath and get some rest.</p><p>Fate sometimes played wicked games on her. Satoshi was standing in the foyer when she entered.</p><p>\"Good evening,\" he said to her.</p><p>Shaundra attempted a bow but her stomach got in the way. \"Good evening.\"</p><p>\"I was starting to worry,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>\"Thanks, it's good to know at least one person worries about me.\"</p><p>\"What do you mean by that?\"</p><p>\"Where is my husband?\"</p><p>\"Oh, well, I don't really know. He left shortly after we came home from rehearsal.\" He paused. \"That was a pretty serious argument the two of you had this morning.\"</p><p>\"You heard?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>\"Yes, we were listening at the window,\" Satoshi admitted.</p><p>Shaundra frowned at him.</p><p>\"What? We don't have lives.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled and shook her head.</p><p>'I don't think I've ever heard you raise your voice to him.\"</p><p>\"I've never had the need to before, but he pissed me off.\"</p><p>\"I think hurt his feelings.\"</p><p>\"Tough,\" Shaundra said. \"He'll get over it.\"</p><p>\"You've been shopping?\" Satoshi asked, peeping at her bags. \"Lingerie.\"</p><p>\"How do you know that?\"</p><p>\"I recognized the name on the bag. I've shopped there a couple of times.\"</p><p>Shaundra raised an eyebrow and smirked. \"Is there something you want to confess?\"</p><p>Satoshi shook his head. \"It was for Cristal. For her trip with Yi-jun.\"</p><p>\"Liar,\" Shaundra said.</p><p>Satoshi took the bag from Shaundra. \"This is nice. The color will bring out Ichiro's eyes.\"</p><p>\"That is not for Ichiro,\" Shaundra said, used to him teasing her husband about his prettiness. \"It's for me. I was in the mood for something sexy.\"</p><p>\"Then it is for Ichiro too. What is it, a makeup present?\"</p><p>\"Hell no. I like the feel of silk against my skin.\"</p><p>\"I thought Harper brought all your underwear.\"</p><p>\"Not all. Just the slutty stuff. \"</p><p>A slow blush stained Satoshi cheeks.</p><p>\"Dig a little deeper, there's also some nursing gowns from after the babies are born. Etsuko reminded me today that I haven't done a thing to prepare for their births.\"</p><p>\"You saw Etsuko? Where?\"</p><p>\"At the restaurant. I had lunch with her and Hana.\"</p><p>\"And Daichi?\"</p><p>\"No, but he was there. He just came out to say hello and to bring me my food.\"</p><p>\"He prepared it for you personally?\"</p><p>\"Yes. He knows I can't have salt and didn't trust the chef to remember. One of the waitresses wanted to do it for me, but Daichi insisted that he do it himself.\"</p><p>Satoshi handed her back her bags. \"A waitress offered to cook for you?\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded. \"She's a chef-in-training. Her name is Eri. Do you know her?\"</p><p>The embarrassed look on his face told her that he did.</p><p>\"Daichi is a very smart and observant man.\"</p><p>\"Yes, he is,\" Shaundra said heading up the stairs. \"So are you.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"How long have you been cooking?\" Eri asked Ichiro.</p><p>\"Since I was a child,\" he told her as he prepared the sushi.</p><p>\"Then I became the official cook for Aomori.\" He chuckled.</p><p>\"Originally it was Masaaki, but he sucked at it.\"</p> <p>\"He's your manager, isn't he?\"</p><p>Ichiro nodded. \"Yes. He's like a big brother to us. He's a nice guy, and he looks after us.\"</p><p>\"How long have you been signing?\"</p><p>\"You're very inquisitive tonight,\" Ichiro told her. \"You should be paying attention to what I'm doing.\"</p><p>\"I am,\" Eri said with a laugh.</p> <p>She has a nice laugh, Ichiro thought. It was kind of girly and not as sultry as Shaundra.</p><p>\"I saw your wife today.\"</p><p>Ichiro stopped making sushi. \"You saw Shaundra? Where?\"</p><p>\"Here,\" Eri said. \"She came to have lunch with your sisters. Why didn't you tell me you were going to be a father?\"</p><p>\"Because it never came up in conversation,\" Ichiro told her.</p><p>\"She's very pretty and Daichi went out of his way to be nice to her. He even prepared her meal personally.\"</p> <p>\"Daichi did?\"</p><p>Eri nodded.</p><p>\"She's on a no-salt diet.\" He wondered why Shaundra did not mention that she was having lunch with his sisters.</p><p>\"I did notice how swollen her ankles were. When is she due?\"</p><p>\"In a couple of weeks. We're expecting twins.\"</p><p>\"Have you two been married long?\"</p><p>\"Almost a year.\" He would be in Europe for their anniversary. \"We got married in the United States while I was on tour there.\" He went back to preparing the fish. He didn't know why he felt comfortable talking about his life with Eri.</p><p>\"Is that where you first met her?\"</p> <p>\"No. I met her in Tokyo. She was helping my boss and hers open a new publishing company, and Mr. Niigata dragged Aomori into the promotion.\"</p><p>\"Why did you marry an American?\"</p><p>\"Because I fell in love with her. How do you say it? She swept me off my feet.\"</p><p>\"That sounds so romantic,\" Eri said. \"That's how I want to be romanced.\"</p><p>Ichiro handed the knife over to her. \"Here, you try this now.\" He hadn't thought about that night in a long time. The memory of he and Shaundra sitting under that cherry blossom tree on the side of the farmhouse came back to him in a full blast. He knew at that moment that she was the woman for him and he wouldn't let anything stand in his way of getting her, not even Yori.</p><p>\"Are the two of you still happy?\" Eri asked. \"Hana kind of told me what happened when your wife disappeared several months ago. You used to drink a lot back then and your family was worried about you.\"</p><p>\"We've been going through some difficult times,\" Ichiro answered. \"She does not seem to understand that I have to be away from home a lot because of my businesses.\"</p><p>\"But that is what a man is supposed to do,\" Eri said. \"You are only trying to take care of her and your family.\"</p><p>\"See, you understand this. She and I had this big argument this morning. I never heard her say some the things she said before. It really hurt me.\"</p><p>\"Sometimes people say stuff that they don't mean when they're angry,\" Eri said.</p><p>\"Oh, she meant it,\" Ichiro said. \"Sometimes she can be very outspoken, but usually it's not against me.\"</p><p>\"She didn't seem too upset when I saw her. I bet she's forgotten about the argument already.\"</p><p>Ichiro doubted that. She was probably at home conjuring up ways to get back at him. \"Maybe I should go home and check on her,\" he said.</p><p>\"Awe, I was just getting the hang of this,\" Eri said. \"Can't we do it just a little while longer?\"</p><p>Ichiro gulped at the provocative sentence. \"Well, maybe for a little while longer.\"</p><p>Eri smiled at him. \"Thanks.\"</p><p>Why did her smile made him feel warm all over?</p><p>Shaundra was fast asleep by the time Ichiro entered their bedroom. He took a shower, noticing the lingerie bag on the chair when he walked back out. Shaundra had purchase lingerie? Why? He pulled back the covers and stared. Royal blue. Lord have mercy. She lay on her back and her boobs spilled over the top of the gown. They were gigantic. His dick hardened, knowing that she belonged to him and him only.</p><p>He went down on one knee and kissed her.</p><p>Shaundra opened her eyes.</p><p>\"I need you,\" he told her.</p><p>\"Sorry,\" she told him. \"I'm not in the mood.\"</p><p>Ichiro put his head down on the side of the mattress. He kind of expected that. He rose to his feet, grabbed his robe, and headed downstairs. He found Satoshi seated in the kitchen, drinking a cup of tea.</p><p>\"What are you still doing up?\" Ichiro asked him.</p><p>\"I couldn't sleep,\" Satoshi told him. \"So I came down for a cup of tea. Join me.\"</p><p>Ichiro walked over to the teapot and poured himself a cup.</p><p>He sat down at the table.</p><p>\"Why aren't you asleep?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"I just got home,\" he replied.</p><p>\"Where have you been?\"</p><p>\"At the restaurant.\"</p><p>\"This time of night?\" Satoshi asked suspiciously. \"What were you doing?\"</p><p>\"Teaching a employee how to make sushi.\"</p><p>\"You're taking on an apprentice?\"</p><p>\"Yes. She wants to be a chef.\"</p><p>\"She?\"</p><p>\"Yes, Eri. You met her at the restaurant.\"</p><p>\"Oh, yes, I remember her. She's pretty.\"</p><p>\"I suppose,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>\"Let me guess, Shaundra still isn't speaking to you.\"</p><p>Ichiro nodded. \"She says she's not in the mood, and she's wearing this royal blue nightgown that makes her look real sexy.\"</p><p>Satoshi sat up straight in his chair. \"Maybe you should apologize to her.\"</p><p>\"No,\" he said. \"I'm right on this one. She is just going to have to understand that there is nothing I can do about this tour.\"</p><p>Satoshi nodded. \"Maybe you should come home to her in the evening and spend some time with her before we leave.</p><p>I'm sure she will appreciate that.\"</p><p>\"I am busy in the evenings. That is the only time I have to train Eri.\"</p><p>\"I understand. Business before pleasure.\"</p><p>\"You make me sound like Mr. Niigata,\" Ichiro said.</p><p>\"No, Mr. Niigata is probably home sleeping with his wife.\"</p><p>\"What does that mean?\"</p><p>Satoshi rose. \"Figure it out.\" He put his cup in the sink.</p><p>\"Nothing comes before Mrs. Niigata.\"</p><p>Sometimes he hated Satoshi so much.</p><p>\"Grow up. Have you forgotten you're about to become a father in less two months?\" He walked out the room.</p><p>Ichiro frowned. No, he had not forgotten.</p><p>Her office looked quite differently without the furniture in it. Takumijo and Satoshi had moved the furniture into Masaaki's room. Masaaki had moved out earlier that week, finally into his first swinging bachelor's pad. She felt a little guilty since it had been his home for years before she moved in. Shaundra guessed he was tired of babysitting a group of grown men and now he could finally get a life.</p><p>Ichiro had left early that morning for a business trip to Kyoto. She supposed it was about the seashore restaurant, but she couldn't be sure since he hadn't said anything to her since that night when she refused to have sex with him. He came to bed and turned his back to her and left before daybreak. The only way she knew about the trip was when she overheard Satoshi and Takumijo discussing it when she walked into the kitchen this morning.</p><p>\"Excuse me,\" Takumijo said as he carried a ladder into the room to begin taping off the windows and molding so he and Satoshi could paint the room that would serve as a nursery for the babies.</p><p>Shaundra moved out of the way and he passed her carrying the heavy ladder like it was a feather. He left out again and returned carrying a box of paint supplies.</p><p>\"Thanks for doing all of this on your day off,\" Shaundra said to him.</p><p>\"You're welcome,\" he told her. \"I didn't have anything else to do since the drama I was working on has ended.\"</p><p>\"I'll have to remember to watch it when it comes on,\"</p><p>Shaundra said. \"I heard that you were a very good actor.\"</p><p>\"I have my moments,\" Takumijo said.</p><p>This was the first time she and him had this long a conversation since they met. She knew he didn't like her much and fortunate for her he was the only one who didn't succumb to the Shaundra disease, as she had named it. \"Are you looking forward to going to Europe next week?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he answered as he began unpacking the painter's tape, brushes, and rollers. \"I'm looking forward to performing on the big stage again. The benefit was nice but not exactly what we're used to. We have to perform for our fans again. If we stay idle too long, they will start to forget us.\"</p><p>\"I guess you're right. I only wish I could travel with you guys, but my place is here.\"</p><p>\"You'll have plenty to keep you busy,\" he said pointing toward her belly. \"And it will give you time to rest before you give birth.\"</p><p>\"You're right about that. I'm going to try to get as much rest as possible because I won't be getting much once the babies are born.\"</p><p>\"Yes, things will be much different around here when we return.\"</p><p>Satoshi entered, carrying a roll of plastic tarp. He placed it on the floor. \"We can take it from here,\" he told her. \"Why don't you go back to bed?\"</p><p>\"I can't,\" Shaundra said. \"I have a manuscript to work on.</p><p>I need to get it finished before the babies arrive.\" She walked toward the door. \"I'll bring you guys up a snack later.\"</p><p>\"Don't you do any such thing,\" Satoshi told her. \"We're perfectly capable of fending for ourselves. Regardless of what everyone thinks, we're capable of feeding ourselves without Ichiro.\"</p><p>Shaundra smirked. Sometimes it was hard to remember that they were grown men. \"Well, I guess I better get out of your way so you can get busy.\" She bowed to them and left the nursery, walked through the bedroom and walked down the hall to her new office. The house seemed unbelievably quiet. Cristal went off to the office to finalize publicity plans for the European trip and wouldn't be returning home until later. And who knew when Ichiro would be back. She turned on her laptop and walked out of the room again to go downstairs to get herself a glass of milk and some fruit. She returned to her new office several minutes later with milk and cookies, having forgotten the fruit when her eyes spotted the dessert.</p><p>The desktop was up on the screen now, so she clicked on the Internet and went straight to her e-mail. After clearing that out, she went over to Twitter to see what the rest of the entertainment world was doing. There was an article on of Aomori's European tour and also one on Yi-jun. Shaundra clicked on it. The page opened and she peered down at the story. Yi-jun posed with his beautiful blonde costar and there was something written that the two of them were in a serious relationship. Shaundra quickly closed the article, hoping Cristal was too busy to surf the Internet today and see it.</p><p>There were a lot of articles about new girl groups.</p><p>Shaundra didn't bother with them. She clicked on an article about electronic book sales. That was more up her alley. She read the article then went from Twitter to Facebook to chat with some of her fans. Finally she was ready to get to work.</p><p>Shaundra put the flash into the USB port, found her premise for her current work-in-progress, and began working the novel's blueprint.</p><p>She was still busy at it hours later when she heard Satoshi and Takumijo walk past the door on their way downstairs.</p><p>Shaundra coughed. The smell of paint had filtered down the hall to her office. She coughed again. I wonder if it will be safe for me to sleep in the room next to the nursery tonight.</p><p>Probably not. Maybe she should get a hotel room for the night until the fumes cleared. Shaundra opened the Internet back up and surfed for nearby hotels. Her cell phone rang. \"Hello?\"</p><p>\"Hello beautiful.\"</p><p>\"Harper! How nice of you to call. What's going on?\"</p><p>\"Oh nothing,\" he said. \"I was just calling to check on you and to see how you were feeling.\"</p><p>\"I'm fine,\" Shaundra replied. \"I'm working on a new manuscript for the New York office.\"</p><p>\"Good,\" he said. \"You're keeping busy. How are the fellows?\"</p><p>\"They're busy preparing for their tour, but today Satoshi and Takumijo are painting the nursery, so I'm trying to stay out of their way.\" She coughed again.</p><p>\"Are you okay?\"</p><p>\"Yes. The paint fumes are filtering from the nursery down to my office.\"</p><p>\"Where is Ichiro?\"</p><p>\"He went to Kyoto,\" she said.</p><p>\"He's not helping to get the nursery together?\" Harper asked.</p><p>She knew that tone of voice. \"No,\" Shaundra said. \"That's not high on his priority list.\" She coughed again.</p><p>\"Are you sure you're okay?\"</p><p>\"The paint smell is getting heavier.\"</p><p>\"That can't be good for the babies.\"</p><p>\"I was just about to reserve a hotel room before you called.\"</p><p>\"Why waste the money on a hotel room when I have a place available right here in town?\"</p><p>\"Thanks, but no thanks,\" Shaundra said. \"I remember the last time you extended such a courtesy to me, and besides you're still the number-one suspect on the baby-daddy list.\"</p><p>Harper chuckled. \"Your life is never drama free.\"</p><p>\"Nope, but hopefully I'll be too busy in the next couple of weeks to care.\"</p><p>\"I still don't like the idea of you being alone in that farmhouse all by yourself for the next two or three months.</p><p>You really should consider coming here or going to stay with Ich's people.\"</p><p>\"I'll be okay,\" Shaundra said. \"There will be security at the gates, and Mr. Niigata has hired someone to come in and check on me every couple of days. And Ichiro's brother will be preparing meals for me, even though I him I can handle my own cooking. I swear they treat me like an invalid. Women have babies every day.\"</p><p>\"Not fifty-one year old women,\" Harper replied.</p><p>\"You would have to mention that. Look, I'm fine, my pressure is stable and the babies are thriving. I just can't control my weight. \"It's going to be hard as hell to take off.\"</p><p>\"I'll pay for you to go to the gym, or I'll hire you a personal trainer.\"</p><p>\"When am I going to have time for that?\" Shaundra asked.</p><p>She'd probably barely have time to use the toilet.</p><p>\"Have you considered hiring a nanny?\"</p><p>\"A nanny?\" Cristal had mentioned that before.</p><p>\"Yes, someone to come in to help you with the babies.\"</p><p>\"No, only rich people do that.\"</p><p>\"You're rich,\" Harper told her.</p><p>\"No, I've never considered that.\"</p><p>\"She could either move in or come a couple days a week to help out,\" he explained to her.</p><p>\"I'll have to look into that,\" Shaundra said. \"But right now I really need to reserve a room to stay for the night.\"</p><p>\"I can take a hint,\" Harper said. \"I'll start putting some feelers out for a nanny and I'll get back to you.\"</p><p>\"Okay,\" Shaundra said. \"But she will have to speak English.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I know.\"</p><p>\"I'll talk to you later.\" She disconnected the call.</p><p>Someone cleared his throat behind her.</p><p>Shaundra turned toward the door. A paint-splattered Satoshi stood in the door carrying a tray. \"I made you lunch,\"</p><p>he told her.</p><p>Shaundra cleared a spot on desk. \"Thank you,\" she said.</p><p>\"So you do know your way around the kitchen,\" she teased.</p><p>\"I told you I don't sit around and starve if Ichiro does not cook for me and spoil me.\" He placed a tuna fish on whole- wheat sandwich in front of her, along with fresh fruit, a glass of ice-cold milk, and two cookies. \"The cookies and milk are for the babies.\"</p><p>\"You're going to spoil them,\" Shaundra said.</p><p>\"That is what uncles are supposed to do.\"</p><p>Shaundra picked up one half of the sandwich and was about to bite into it when she started to cough. She bit the sandwich, chewed, and swallowed. \"This is good.\"</p><p>\"Ich prepared the tuna before he left so I know there's not salt in it.\"</p><p>She felt bad that they had to be on a salt-free diet with her. \"Did he say when he'd be returning?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Satoshi answered. \"You two still haven't kissed and made up?\"</p><p>\"No,\" Shaundra said. She pulled up the page for the local hotels.</p><p>\"Planning a trip?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"No, just a little overnight excursion.\"</p><p>\"Who's the lucky fellow?\"</p><p>Shaundra hit him on the arm. \"I don't think I should stay here tonight because of the paint fumes, you bad boy.\"</p><p>\"I did hear the cough. Do you want me to take you into town?\"</p><p>\"No, I can drive myself.\"</p><p>\"You can barely get that belly beneath the steering wheel.\"</p><p>Shaundra sneered at him.</p><p>\"What are you going to do for dinner? You know you can't eat takeout.\"</p><p>\"I'll call the restaurant and have Daichi prepared me a to- go plate.\"</p><p>\"Daichi. Are you getting chummy with Ichiro's older big brother?\"</p><p>\"No, we are family, and he has my back.\"</p><p>\"I have your back too.\"</p><p>\"That's nice to know.\" She bit into the sandwich again and chewed as she looked down at the monitor. She swallowed.</p><p>\"This hotel seems nice. It has free Wi-Fi.\"</p><p>\"And good mattresses on the beds.\"</p><p>Shaundra looked up at him. \"How do you know that?\"</p><p>Satoshi smiled innocently down at her. \"I've slept there once or twice.\"</p><p>\"Alone?\" she asked.</p><p>\"No comment,\" he said.</p><p>Shaundra smirked at him and then made her reservations.</p><p>\"I can check in around three. I'll take my laptop and work on my book and then I'll be back here tomorrow after checkout time.\"</p><p>\"What should I tell Ichiro in case he wants to know where you are?\" Satoshi asked.</p><p>\"The truth,\" Shaundra said. \"I don't have anything to hide from him, and I'm sure the lungs of his babies are more important than his ego.\"</p><p>Satoshi shrugged.</p><p>She finished her sandwich and picked up one of the cookies and bit into it. \"Yummy. Oatmeal raisin is the best.\"</p><p>Satoshi reached over and wiped a crumb from her cheek.</p><p>\"Only the best for you,\" he said. \"Come find me before you leave. I have to get back to painting.\"</p><p>Shaundra nodded.</p><p>\"By the way, where are the cribs?\"</p><p>\"In the storage outside with the rest of the baby furniture.</p><p>Why?\"</p><p>\"We might as well put them together too. If not, you're going to have to hire someone to do it. I would tell you to asked one of the security, but they won't come near you, fearful that your crazy husband might beat the shit out of them.\"</p><p>Shaundra chuckled and shook her head at what he just told her. \"You guys are doing too much already.\"</p><p>\"Nonsense,\" Satoshi said. \"Sometimes it's good to just do things with our hands. It stimulates our creativity.\"</p><p>\"And keeps you guys out of trouble.\"</p><p>He smiled and the smiled reached his eyes. \"See you later.\" He walked away leaving her to her wicked little thoughts.</p><p>Ichiro walked into the farmhouse exhausted after driving the long distance to and from Kyoto for his meeting with the land developers and mortgage company. If everything went as scheduled, he and Shaundra would be in their new home by the New Year.</p><p>The odor of paint met him at the door. He followed the scent up the stairs and down the upstairs hall to his bedroom.</p><p>There was a light coming from Shaundra's office and voices.</p><p>He tossed his hat and jacket on the bed and walked over to the door. It sounded like Satoshi. Why was he up in Shaundra's office so late, and why was the door closed?\"</p><p>He turned the knob and opened the door. The odor of paint got stronger. All of Shaundra's office furniture had been removed and someone had painted the walls a soft shade of green.</p><p>\"Don't touch the walls. They could still be wet,\" Satoshi told him from behind the door somewhere.</p><p>Ichiro entered the room and found him and Takumijo seated on the floor putting something together. \"What are you two up to?\" His eyes landed on a two white cribs. One had a picture of a rocking horse on it and the other had a toy soldier. He had forgotten...the nursery. Satoshi and Takumijo were getting it together for Shaundra. \"Thanks,\" he said. \"I should be doing this.\"</p><p>\"No problem,\" Takumijo said. \"We know you've been busy.\"</p><p>\"I like this color,\" he said of the walls. \"It's relaxing.\" He stared at the two matching white chest of drawers, the white dressing table, and the two of them were obviously trying to put together a white Bentwood rocking chair. \"Where is my wife?\"</p><p>\"She's staying at a hotel in town tonight,\" Satoshi told him. \"The paint fumes aren't good for the babies.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" Ichiro said. \"Did she go there alone? I mean did she drive herself?\"</p><p>\"Yes. I offered to take her but you know how she is? She took her laptop, a change of clothing and left around two this afternoon.\"</p><p>Ichiro looked at his watch. It was eight pm. Shaundra was probably getting ready for bed. \"Did she eat today?\"</p><p>\"Yes, I made her a tuna sandwich for lunch.\"</p><p>\"But she was gone by dinner time. I hope she doesn't eat any fast food.\"</p><p>\"Relax,\" Satoshi told him. \"She was supposed to stop at your restaurant and have Daichi prepare her a little something.\"</p><p>Ichiro frowned.</p><p>\"He's your brother. Don't make it into more than him just trying to help out a member of the family.\"</p><p>\"You don't know what I go through. Why does every man in the world take a liking to my wife?\"</p><p>\"She married you and she's carrying your two big-headed babies inside of her,\" Takumijo said.</p><p>\"Well, I'm not so sure...\"</p><p>\"What?\" Takumijo rose to his feet. \"I am so tired of all you and these rumors. Shaundra is not cheating on you. Why would she? Look at you. You're tall and gorgeous and packing. You have her screaming your name every time the two of you make love. Why would she go to someone else?</p><p>She left everything and everybody she loved to come here to be with you. She flew on a plane even though she was terrified to be with you. Shaundra went from being finally having a life with her kids out her house to moving in here with a bunch of kids. What woman in her right mind would go through what she's gone through if she was not hopelessly in love with you? Now if you'll both excuse me I have to get ready for my date.\" Takumijo pushed past him leaving him alone in the nursery with Satoshi.\"</p><p>\"Well put,\" Satoshi said.</p><p>Ichiro lowered his head. \"I know. I love her so much I just go crazy. I just keep feeling inferior to all the males in her life. Mr. Niigata is right. Maybe I should have dated other women before I got married; then I would have known how to treat a wife.\"</p><p>\"She's at the Golden Palm Hotel,\" Satoshi told him. \"Room3.\"</p><p>Ichiro lifted his head. \"How do you know this?\"</p><p>\"I made sure she called me when she got there. I thought you would want to know.\"</p><p>\"Thanks,\" Ichiro said, dashing into the bedroom. He threw a change of clothes into a bag and went to find his wife.</p><p>Ichiro walked into the restaurant through the employee entrance and headed toward the kitchen. He found Eri in the kitchen pouring over a recipe book. She looked up when she heard him.</p><p>\"Oh, Ichiro, you scared the life out of me,\" she said. \"What are you doing here?\"</p><p>The restaurant had closed about an hour ago and everyone had gone home. \"I just stopped by to pick up a couple of things. \"Why are you still here?\"</p><p>\"Trying to learn how to make a raspberry torte cake,\" she answered.</p><p>\"Why?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I saw it on television earlier. I thought it looked challenging. Daichi said he might let me prepare something for the diners one of these days.\"</p><p>She had to master the basics before she attempted something as complicated as that.</p><p>\"Come look at this and tell me what you think?\"</p><p>Ichiro walked over and peered down into the book. The scent of her perfume teased his nose. He read the recipe to take his mind off her perfume. \"You will have to practice a lot before you can get that down perfect,\" he told her. \"You have to make sure it does not come out too spongy or dry. Why don't you attempt something easier first?\" He flipped through the book and then pointed.</p><p>\"A birthday cake?\"</p><p>\"Yes. I was thinking about opening the place up for birthday parties. If you do well, then we won't have to hire a baker.\"</p><p>\"You'd let me do that,\" Eri asked looking up at him excitedly.</p><p>Ichiro nodded.</p><p>Eri jumped into his arms, nearly knocking him over.</p><p>\"You're the best,\" she said, kissing him on the cheek.</p><p>Ichiro's body responded. He pushed away from her. \"Well, you'll have to prove to me that you can do it,\" he told her, trying to stave off a rising erection in his briefs.</p><p>\"I will,\" she said smiling. \"Thank you for the opportunity.\"</p><p>\"You're welcome,\" he said. \"But I just came by to get a few things.\" He moved away from her and gathered up what he came for. \"Don't stay too long. It's not safe for you to be leaving her alone.\"</p><p>\"I won't,\" Eri assured him. \"I'm just about to leave.\" She closed up the book and grabbed her purse. \"See you tomorrow,\" she said, dashing out of the employee door.</p><p>Ichiro put the food into a bag and walked through the restaurant turning out lights and making sure everything was secured. He set the alarm on his way out of the door. Eri was just driving away when he walked toward his car. He watched her drive away.</p><p>Shaundra tossed and turned in the bed. Forget what Satoshi had said. Either the mattress was uncomfortable or she missed her bed back at the farmhouse.</p><p>She sat up in the bed, brushing back the covers and then easing down to the floor. She walked to the bathroom to relieve her bladder and then walked back into the bedroom.</p><p>Someone knocked at the door. She looked down at the clock. Ten p.m. WTF? she thought. \"Who is it?\" she asked.</p><p>\"It's me, Shaundra.\"</p><p>\"Ichiro?\"</p><p>Shaundra removed both security locks and opened the door. Her husband stood on the other side looking tired, adorable and sexy, and he carried an overnight bag and food.</p><p>\"What are you doing here?\"</p><p>\"I've come to apologize,\" he said. \"And to be with my wife and my babies.\"</p><p>\"How did you know where I was?\"</p><p>\"Satoshi,\" he said. \"May I come in?\"</p><p>Shaundra stepped aside. Ichiro entered, touching her stomach tenderly as he passed. He put the things he carried down and sat down in a chair. \"I've been a horrible husband.</p><p>I never once considered your feelings since the day we met.</p><p>It's always been what I wanted and about my career. I've put everything before you and our marriage and I'm sorry.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry too,\" Shaundra said sitting down on the bed.</p><p>\"You look lovely in that gown,\" Ichiro say.</p><p>It was one of the gowns she'd purchased at the lingerie shop. This one was a pale blue. \"Thank you.\"</p><p>\"Have you eaten?\" he asked.</p><p>She nodded. \"I stopped by the restaurant on my way here and Daichi fixed me something.\"</p><p>\"Then do you mind if I take a shower. I've been on the road all evening.\"</p><p>\"Be my guest,\" Shaundra said, not quite believing what had just occurred. He was the last person she suspected of seeing and why did he smell like cheap perfume?</p><p>Shaundra was in the bed when he exited the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist. Her eyes were closed like she was resting. He looked down at her. Baby blue. Lord have mercy. She lay on her back and her boobs spilled over the top of this gown too like the dark blue one. His baby was stacked. He went down on one knee and kissed her.</p><p>Shaundra opened her eyes. \"I need you,\" he said to her.</p><p>\"Please do not say no.\"</p><p>She didn't say a word, just stared at him with those big brown eyes and smiled.</p><p>Ichiro got up and sat on the side of the bed. He peeled back one of the strips of the gown and gently kissed her shoulder and then the top of one of her breasts. Her dark nipples hardened. He captured it in his lips. His right hand reached over and caressed the other one through the blue, silky material.</p><p>Shaundra moaned.</p><p>Ichiro peeled down the other strap and moved the top of the gown down to expose both breasts. They stood sat high on her chest and did not sag. \"How are my babies?\" he asked lowering the gown and exposing her belly. They wiggled beneath his touch. \"Daddy loves both of you.\" He kissed her belly and Shaundra fingers entered his hair and released it from the ponytail holder. It cascaded down his shoulders.</p><p>Ichiro slipped the gown down over her hips and swept it off her body. She was nude and she had a sweet cocoa butter smell. He moved his hand between her legs and met with the dewy moisture of her womanhood. She was wet and ready for him. Ichiro moved on the bed and between her legs. He lowered his head and tasted her...delicious.</p><p>Shaundra moaned softly as his tongue entered her. Her hips moved above him and she trembled. \"Oh, Ich.\"</p><p>Ichiro removed his mouth and inserted two fingers. He pushed them deep inside of her and she tightened her thighs around his arm. He moved the fingers in and out of her in a teasing manner. His fingers got drenched with her juices each time he withdrew. Shaundra moved her hips as he continued the sensual foreplay. Her legs unclenched and he had full access to her. He moved a third finger inside, moving his hand a little faster.</p><p>\"Oh, oh, oh,\" she said as her body lifted from the mattress. She went off like a geyser, wetting his fingers and the palm of his hand. Damn, he'd never get tired of seeing her do this.</p><p>Ichiro moved to the top of the bed and lay down next to her while she recovered. Shaundra was all over him before he could get comfortable on the pillow.</p><p>\"Whoa, baby,\" he said as she wrapped her lips around his cock. Maybe they should argue more often. \"Ah!\" he moaned as she attempted to deep throat him. She did it and didn't even gag. Shaundra reached between his legs and gently squeezed his balls. She wrapped her other hand around his penis and squeezed gently on the base. That nearly sent him over the edge. Shaundra yanked his length, demanding that it rise and harden for her. She put her lips around the head and sucked and lick the precum that had put in an appearance.</p><p>The slurping noises nearly took his breath away.</p><p>Shaundra came up for air and mounted him with her back to him.</p><p>\"Ooh,\" he uttered as she slid down on his dick. \"Are you sure the babies are safe?\" he asked as she started working those hips and butt.</p><p>\"Yes,\" she said, putting an end to the conversation.</p><p>Ichiro gripped her from behind. \"What an ass.\" He squeezed both cheeks gently.</p><p>\"Harder,\" she told him as she moved back and forth on his dick.</p><p>Ichiro squeezed harder and Shaundra purred. He ran his finger down the crack and she trembled. Ichiro teased the little hole and Shaundra shook. He had no idea she was so sensitive. He went the tip of his longest finger and inserted the tip into her rectum.</p><p>Shaundra rolled back on his finger. Ichiro pushed the finger further in and it disappeared and Shaundra gasped. It was the sexiest sound he'd heard in a long time. He eased the finger in and out and then withdrew it. He tried two fingers this time. Shaundra went off like a bottle rocket, drenching his pubic area. Ichiro removed the fingers, slid his wife onto her back, and crawled between her legs.</p><p>\"If I knew you were so sensitive in that area, I would have taken you that way?\"</p><p>Shaundra cocked an eyebrow. \"Get a condom and some lube,\" she told him.</p><p>Ichiro eyes widened. \"What?\"</p><p>\"You want to get freaky with me?\"</p><p>Ichiro slipped off the bed, found his overnight bag and advanced onto the bed again. \"You really mean it?\"</p><p>Shaundra rolled over on her side and presented her behind to him.</p><p>Ichiro donned the condom and squeezed some of the lube onto his fingers and smeared it on the tight hole.</p><p>\"Do you know what you're doing?\" Shaundra asked him.</p><p>\"No, but I'm willing to try if you are.\" He moved in behind her, lifted her leg, and held it. He parted the cheeks and guided the head of his dick against her. Shaundra gasped loudly as he inched the head inside of her.</p><p>Ichiro closed his eyes and moved his hips slowly, feeling a little more of his length move inside of her.</p><p>Shaundra moved back on him.</p><p>\"Does it hurt?\" he asked.</p><p>\"What do you think?\" she asked as he continued to move in and out of her.</p><p>He lifted her leg higher and slid in deeper. It felt tight and different than her pussy. He didn't know if he liked doing this or not. Definitely not. He slid out of her and removed the condom.</p><p>\"What's the matter?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Not for me,\" he said.</p><p>Shaundra chuckled. \"Satoshi will be so disappointed.\"</p><p>Ichiro pinched her on the butt. \"Too bad,\" he said, rolling her over on her back and moving between her legs. \"I like cunt. Satoshi will just have to get over it.\" He pushed inside of her. He liked the wetness and the warmth he felt when she surrounded his waist with her thighs. He had to balance himself over her stomach so he wouldn't hurt her. He raised her legs and sank down as far as he could. Shaundra moved with him. \"I've missed you,\" he said.</p><p>Shaundra trembled in her arms. \"I missed you too, baby,\"</p><p>she said with a moan as he buried himself inside her. He had her panting as he made love to her. Sweat dripped down their bodies. \"Ooh, baby. Ah!\" It felt so good. His baby was so passionate.</p><p>Shaundra went off for a third time. \"I'm coming, Ich.\"</p><p>The sweet sound sent him straight into orgasm. He cuddled her into his arms, rolled her on top of him and shot up inside of her. Shaundra kissed him. \"I love you, Ich,\" she said.</p><p>\"I love you too, Eri.\"</p><p>\"What?\" Shaundra asked. She rolled off him and kicked him off the side of the bed. \"I knew it, you cheating bastard.\"</p><p>Ichiro lay on the floor disoriented. \"Oh, my, what have I done?\" The last thing he heard was the sound of the bathroom door slamming.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
