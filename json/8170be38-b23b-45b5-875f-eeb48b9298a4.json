They timed it for when the worst of the summer heat was past, but it was still shorts and tank top weather. This year was unseasonably cool, so late August was the date. It was the earliest they\u2019d ever been able to do it. The cookout was family friendly, so light drinking at best, and if you wanted to get drunk, Katie Zerbrowski would hand you your head in a verbal basket before she kicked your ass out the door. Since she was a few inches smaller than my own five foot three, and more delicate looking; it was always fun to see her take on a big, tough, drunk cop and win, but I\u2019d stopped going a few years back. Far too many small children, not my favorite thing, and too much family stuff. When I\u2019d been the only single female at the thing the wives had either tried to fix me up, or the single guys had tried to hit on me, or . . . my social skills hadn\u2019t been up to it, but that had been before Micah Callahan and Nathaniel Graison.</p><p>They\u2019d been to dinner at the Zerbrowskis\u2019 house before, both to a cop cookout and a dinner party, but those had been much smaller events. Katie and Zerbrowski had handpicked the guest list for people who would deal better with the fact that I came with two men, and would have married both if it had been legal.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t intended to brave the big event. I wasn\u2019t a fan of crowds, and I didn\u2019t want to have to alienate cops I\u2019d have to work with later by defending my lifestyle to them, but Nathaniel was Facebook friends with Katie, and she\u2019d been mentioning how much work it was finishing up her second master\u2019s degree along with planning for the big party, so my wonderful domestic boyfriend had offered to help, and just like that we were committed.</p><p>Nathaniel had been cooking for days, mostly sides like potato salad, macaroni salad, and coleslaw, which he\u2019d all managed to make with less mayonnaise, or lite mayonnaise, or something that made it healthier but still yummy. He\u2019d also baked a frosted layer cake and a batch of homemade rolls. If it had been left to Micah and me, it would have all been store-bought, and much less healthy, though eyeing the chocolate layer cake, I was wondering what he\u2019d done to it to make it \u201chealthier.\u201d I was really hoping nothing. I liked chocolate cake.</p> <p>I wasn\u2019t the only one. Matthew, who was four, asked from his child safety seat in the back, \u201cWhen can we have cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter meat and veggies,\u201d Nathaniel said automatically from the backseat. We\u2019d been babysitting Matthew a lot in the last two years.</p><p>I was driving, so I could only glance back at Matthew and Nathaniel. He was holding the cake in his lap, because iced cakes and cars are always chancy. This was the first time that any of the other cops\u2019 wives had really treated Nathaniel like another wife, and he was a little nervous about it. It was cute, and so was he. Okay, he was gorgeous, his face model-handsome where it showed around the sunglasses. They hid the lavender eyes, not blue, but the color of spring lilacs. The blue tank top he was wearing would make his eyes lean closer to blue, but they weren\u2019t. I\u2019d never met anyone else with lavender eyes, but they were just the cherry on the too-pretty-to-be-mine cupcake that was Nathaniel, because the tank top also showed off the muscles in his shoulders and arms, a hint of chest. The shirt was a little loose as it fell around his upper body, because a tank that clung to his body would just be unfair to the other men at the party.</p><p>He had his ankle-length auburn hair back in a braid, but I realized that his hair was only a little more red auburn than Matthew\u2019s browner auburn. How had I never noticed it before? Maybe it was that Matthew\u2019s curls had finally grown long enough to trail over the collar of his blue T-shirt, because he\u2019d persuaded his mother, Monica Vespucci, to let him grow his hair out like Uncle Nathaniel and Uncle Jean-Claude and Uncle Micah. Monica was away on a weeklong business conference. She was a successful lawyer, and the widow of one of Jean-Claude\u2019s employees, Robert, who had been a vampire companion of his for over a hundred years. It made him feel responsible for the family. Monica had no family in town, so he felt we should step in to help her with Matthew. It was a noble thought, but since Jean-Claude was the head of the American Vampire Council, he was usually dead to the world when Matthew had to be picked up from preschool, or taken to dance class, he was unable to be on twenty-four-hour availability when Monica had a deposition out of state or a business conference. Since Monica\u2019s deceased husband had been a vampire, too, it made me realize she\u2019d have been almost in the same boat if he\u2019d lived. Funny, the things you don\u2019t think of when you date vampires.</p><p>Micah was beside me in the passenger seat. He\u2019d chosen a green T-shirt that did cling, but he didn\u2019t muscle up the way Nathaniel did, and he was five foot three to Nathaniel\u2019s five foot nine, so a baggy T-shirt would have made him look even smaller and more delicate. His face was a soft triangle with only a little extra length through the jawline that made him look male and not like a beautiful, dainty woman. With the tighter shirt you could see the leanness of his body, the fine muscles that he got through running, lifting weights, and fighting practice. My muscles came from the same things, except I did weapons drills more than he did, but the regimen had put muscle on my delicate girl frame, too. I actually bulked up easier than he did, but I bulked up for a girl, so that between him not bulking much and me bulking more than most women, we could trade T-shirts, and some of our jeans. Though today he was in jean shorts that wouldn\u2019t have been comfy over the curve of my thighs. Nathaniel and I were both in jogging shorts, because they fit over the more generous thighs we both had. Lush was a word you\u2019d use for both of us, where Micah was lean. I\u2019d never dated anyone before who was small enough to share my clothes. I kind of liked it.</p> <p>We both had long curly hair to just past our shoulder blades, his dark chestnut brown that had been blond when he was a child, mine true black and always had been. Nathaniel had braided Micah\u2019s hair, and braided the upper level of mine, so we\u2019d be a little cooler in the heat. It wasn\u2019t the usual August hot, but it still wasn\u2019t as cool as most of the country. We were both wearing sunglasses against the St. Louis summer sun, but my eyes were just a nice solid brown like Matthew\u2019s, except a little darker. Micah\u2019s eyes were green around the pupil with a circle of yellow outside of it; depending on the light, his moods, his shirt color, they could look more yellow, or more green, but they were chartreuse, a mix of both colors, and not human. He was a wereleopard, and his eyes were the leopard eyes of his beast form, because a very bad man had forced him into leopard form for so long that when he came back to human, his eyes didn\u2019t change back. He wore sunglasses most of the time, knowing how unusual his eyes looked, but surprisingly few people realized what they were looking at. They\u2019d just say, \u201cPretty green eyes.\u201d People see what they expect to see.</p><p>Cops don\u2019t, but then everyone at the party knew that my two boyfriends were wereleopards. They even knew that Micah was head of the Coalition for Better Understanding Between Human and Lycanthrope communities. He\u2019d become the public face for his minority group. Lycanthropy was a disease, but less than twenty years ago it had still been legal to kill someone on sight for having it. In some western states, even today, if you killed a wereanimal and the blood test proved it, it was deemed self-defense regardless of circumstances.</p><p>I was in the actual neighborhood where Zerbrowski lived now, driving past the three different styles of house in the development over and over, just different colors, different accessories, but it was an American suburb, which meant the houses were all vaguely alike. The Zerbrowski house was the one-story ranch style. Theirs had brick siding and a neatly trimmed lawn that was green enough to show they watered it. The shrubs were neat and trimmed low near the foundation with a small flower bed on either side of the sidewalk that led to the front door. The flowers were a brilliant splash of yellow, white, and red.</p><p>The driveway was full, but there was only one car out in front, and I pulled in behind it. Last time I\u2019d been here the entire street had been full of cars; this time we\u2019d arrived early so that Nathaniel could help the other \u201cwives\u201d with the kitchen stuff. Meat would be grilled outside by Mr. Zerbrowski and any other men he let near his grill. The arrangement was all very traditional, but then most cops like traditional roles. Their jobs can be full of such weird shit I think it makes them cling to the normal stuff. I was a U.S. Marshal for the preternatural branch of the service, which meant I was only involved in crimes that had some preternatural element. When I wasn\u2019t serving an active warrant for the Marshal service, my night job was raising zombies for Animators Incorporated. I\u2019d been doing a lot of historical society jobs lately\u2014you know, raise the dead and just ask them what happened at such and such battle on this date.</p><p>All my jobs were weird shit, so I should have been more conservative than the rest of the police, and once I had been, but that had been before Jean-Claude, master vampire of St. Louis, found me, before I\u2019d started considering vampires friends and lovers instead of just evil walking corpses. Now here I was, showing up with two live-in lovers and a child, all without the benefit of a wedding band. Matthew was with us for a week; it was the longest he\u2019d ever stayed with us and he was taking it as normal. One of the reasons we\u2019d brought Matthew rather than leaving him home with one of his other \u201cuncles\u201d was because Nathaniel realized there\u2019d be other kids. Nathaniel had pointed out that Matthew was pretty isolated from other children once he left preschool. Monica was a busy single parent, she didn\u2019t have a lot of time to arrange playdates for him, so we brought Matthew so he could make friends. I knew there\u2019d be some kids around his age, and lots of older and younger ones. It might be the most children Matthew had ever been around except at a dance recital. The thought was a little overwhelming for me, but a good one for the kid.</p><p>Once the car was stopped I undid my seat belt. That was the signal for everyone else to undo theirs. Matthew could undo his own child safety seat, which is what we called it, since he\u2019d objected to \u201cbaby seat\u201d as a term.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nathaniel carried the cake. Micah and I divided up the various lite mayonnaise salads, then Matthew said, \u201cWhat can I carry?\u201d</p><p>Micah and I looked at each other. I don\u2019t know what I would have said, because Nathaniel beat us to it. \u201cThe veggie and fruit tray,\u201d he said, pointing at a large round hard plastic tray, covered with a hard plastic lid over all the individual compartments of carrot and celery sticks, little tomatoes, grapes, melon wedges, apple slices, and sweet colored bell peppers. I knew there were different dipping sauces somewhere, but they\u2019d be put out around the tray later; right now the tray was nearly indestructible. Matthew could have rolled it on its side like a wheel into the house and everything would have stayed in place. It was brilliant, though huge, so that Matthew struggled to see over or around it. He looked cuter than normal with the huge tray, blue T-shirt, little jean shorts, and Spider-Man jogging shoes. It didn\u2019t show from the back, but I knew that Spidey\u2019s eyes blinked red from the front. Matthew\u2019s very serious face let me know that telling him how cute he looked would not go over well. I had the same reaction sometimes, so I couldn\u2019t really blame him.</p><p>I was a little distracted from the cute kid stuff by Nathaniel\u2019s braid bobbing down the length of his body as he walked beside and a little ahead of Matthew. With sunlight on both of them, their hair color was even more similar, and I realized that Matthews\u2019s shirt and Nathaniel\u2019s tank top were almost the same shade of blue. I wondered if that had been accidental. Matthew looked up to Nathaniel and copied him sometimes, but my boyfriend also liked having Matthew around a lot. Nathaniel had even started hinting that he wanted a rug rat of our very own. I was okay if the kid wanted to dress like Uncle Natty, but less okay with Nathaniel wanting them to match. It would feel like just one more bit of pressure from my most domestic of partners.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re frowning,\u201d Micah said, leaning in so no one else would hear.</p><p>\u201cSorry, just thinking too hard, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>But Katie Zerbrowski opened the door and we had to hurry to catch up. I\u2019d worry later about Nathaniel trying to punch my biological clock.</p><p>Katie was barely five feet tall, maybe an inch below. She made even Micah and me seem not so delicate, not so tiny. She had long wavy brown hair that was nearly to her waist, and had had it that long since college. Zerbrowski had told me that with a happy smile and a sparkle in his eye. They\u2019d been married for close to twenty years and were still crazy for each other. They gave me hope that maybe, just maybe, love could last.</p> <p>I was three years and counting with Micah and Nathaniel, and six of dating Jean-Claude, but that six had included a hell of a lot of breakups in our togetherness, and then Micah and Nathaniel had come into my life and something about them helped stabilize things. Funny how the right mix of people can change everything, but there was still a part of me that kept waiting for it all to go to hell. At least I\u2019d stopped poking at it and trying to break it myself, that was a step up. Let\u2019s hear it for therapy and smart friends who intervened when I fell back into old destructive habits.</p><p>Katie had put barrettes in her hair that held it neatly behind each ear, showing off the diamond earrings that Zerbrowski had bought her for their last anniversary. Her summer dress was a soft blue, and she looked as beautiful and fresh as the flowers by their door.</p><p>Zerbrowski called out behind her and walked toward us over the new hardwood floor they\u2019d laid this year. The floor gleamed with polish, and looked as fresh and neat as the rest of the living room. Katie matched the airy spaciousness of the room. Zerbrowski was wearing a pair of khaki shorts and a band T-shirt, much loved and faded. Katie tried to dress him neatly during the week for work, but on the weekends their bargain was that he could be comfortable. Her efforts to get him into nice suits and ties was really pretty wasted since he seemed to attract stains and have his freshly pressed shirts wrinkle as if by magic. Zerbrowski was like a more polite grownup version of Pigpen and Charlie Brown all mixed up together, and Katie was the unattainable little redheaded girl, except that this beautiful woman had seen past the wire-framed glasses and messy hair to find the love of her life, of their lives. Like I said, they made me believe in the whole true love thing.</p><p>They kissed each other automatically before Katie led the way toward the kitchen, and Zerbrowski asked, \u201cThere anything else that needs carrying in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, this is it,\u201d I said.</p><p>We all set the food down on the big island in the neat-as-a-pin kitchen, except for Matthew, who had to go up on tiptoe to try and push the veggie tray onto the countertop. I gave it the little nudge it needed, and it was safe.</p> <p>\u201cAll the food looks amazing, Nathaniel,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cThanks, I appreciated the chance to help out, and I had help.\u201d He put his hands on Matthew\u2019s small shoulders.</p><p>Katie smiled down at the little boy. \u201cDid you help fix all this?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cUncle Natty\u2019s teaching me to cook so I\u2019ll be able to help my girlfriend when I grow up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that; maybe you can tell my son that women like a man who can cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Matthew said.</p><p>Zerbrowski laughed. \u201cWell, thank you, Matthew and Nathaniel, for helping Katie out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Zerbrowski, you could have helped her cook stuff,\u201d I said.</p> <p>Katie laughed, and it matched the rest of her, airy and pretty, if a laugh could be pretty. \u201cOh, no, Anita, the only person less likely to be helpful in the kitchen than you is my husband. I swear, if there was a way to do it, he\u2019d burn water.\u201d</p><p>Zerbrowski pushed his glasses more firmly up his nose and grinned at her. \u201cBut you love me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been a terrible cook we might never have dated,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t cook and it\u2019s never helped me date\u2014how\u2019d it help you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>They looked at each other, faces alight with a shared secret. He made a little gesture at her.</p><p>She said, \u201cWe met at college. Anita probably already knows that.\u201d</p><p>I nodded that I did. He\u2019d actually told me he had to get her drunk for her to agree to a date, but I was pretty sure he was kidding, though sometimes it was hard to tell with him.</p><p>Katie continued, \u201cZerbrowski says he knew who I was, because he used to sit behind me in American History and stare at my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really pretty hair,\u201d he said, and went around the island so he could put his arm across her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThank you, dear, but I didn\u2019t know who he was until the night of the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat fire?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She snuggled in against him, tucked under his arm, hers around his waist, and said, \u201cHe set his dorm room on fire trying to make soup.\u201d</p><p>I grinned at them. \u201cHow bad a fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoup from scratch is hard,\u201d Nathaniel said.</p><p>Zerbrowski shook his head. \u201cNope, I opened a can of Campbell\u2019s tomato soup and the next thing I knew the fire alarm was going off, there was smoke everywhere, and flames. The dorm monitor was yelling for us all to get out. I grabbed the hall fire extinguisher and put out the fire I could see, but we still had to evacuate the dorm.\u201d</p><p>All the grownups laughed, even Zerbrowski, but Matthew didn\u2019t get the joke. He looked up at us, clearly puzzled. I didn\u2019t try to explain the humor, I\u2019d learned that humor is a skill set like a lot of socialization, and Matthew just had to learn it as he went. Explained jokes lose their funniness.</p><p>Katie said, \u201cI was coming back from a movie with friends, and we went to see what was happening. I saw my future husband for the first time covered in black soot, hair every which way, his dorm monitor screaming at him, and him waving the fire extinguisher back at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove at first sight?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, but he was totally calm in the middle of it all. Everyone else was angry, or scared, or just confused, but he wasn\u2019t.\u201d She looked up at him with that shining look she saved just for him.</p><p>\u201cShe thought I was brave,\u201d Zerbrowski said.</p><p>\u201cYou were and are,\u201d she said.</p><p>He shrugged, but looked pleased. \u201cShe recognized my hair and glasses in class the next day, and started talking to me. I\u2019d spent almost an entire semester trying to get the nerve up to talk to her, and she just comes up and does it for me. It was totally worth destroying the dorm\u2019s kitchen and nearly getting expelled.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him again, and then asked, \u201cHow did you guys meet?\u201d</p><p>We all looked at each other, because our stories weren\u2019t cute. Nathaniel said, \u201cI was in the hospital after being attacked by someone who wanted to see how much damage a wereanimal could heal. Anita came to visit another mutual friend. The friend introduced us, and I spent a couple of years trying to persuade her to sleep with me.\u201d</p><p>I stared at him, because it was all true, but so sanitized for the Zerbrowskis\u2019 benefit that I wouldn\u2019t have recognized it. The person who had attacked him had been a paying client, because Nathaniel had still been a high-priced and very specialized male escort when we first met. He\u2019d also done a few pornographic movies, which he\u2019d given me as a gift, thinking it was seductive. Sometimes I thought nothing short of deity intervention had gotten Nathaniel and me together, because when you just listed events, it seemed improbable. Yet here we were.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you date him?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember him asking to date me, at first,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI was just aiming at being her lover, I never dreamed she\u2019d date me for real, let alone be my queen.\u201d</p><p>I moved in so I could go up on tiptoe and kiss him, while Matthew held his hand and the Zerbrowskis beamed at us. Happily married people like seeing happy couples.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s so sweet, your queen, and are you her king?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>Nathaniel smiled at me, but said, \u201cNo, Micah is our king.\u201d He looked past me to Micah, who was still standing by himself. I didn\u2019t look behind us at my other sweetie; I watched Katie\u2019s face flinch just a little. She was a good sport about it, but she didn\u2019t really understand how I could be in love with more than one person, and there was that whole male/female/male dynamic, too. Zerbrowski just grinned at us all. If he had a problem with us, I didn\u2019t know about it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Micah had noticed Katie\u2019s momentary expression, because he didn\u2019t come closer to us. That wasn\u2019t okay, because if we were going to be here today, it had to be real, no hiding. I reached my free hand out to him, and after a moment\u2019s hesitation he came to me, to us.</p><p>I kissed Micah, and then there was tension in his hand as Nathaniel leaned down for a kiss, too. It wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t kiss each other, but in public it didn\u2019t always go over well. Even I tensed up, because I wasn\u2019t sure if Zerbrowski was that secure in his manhood\u2014or Katie either, so to speak.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are just cute together,\u201d Zerbrowski said.</p> <p>I gave him the smile that comment and the genuine look of happiness in his face deserved. Katie hugged her husband and smiled at us. \u201cHe\u2019s right, you guys are cute. How did you and Micah meet?\u201d</p><p>We told a version of the truth, but it left so much out that I always thought of it as a lie. Micah had already sanitized the story for the press; since he was interviewed a lot by the media as the head of the Coalition for Better Understanding Between Humans and Lycanthropes, the question had come up before.</p><p>\u201cI came into town hoping to find a city that would understand what I was trying to do with the Coalition. Anita was there when I met the other wereleopards, and it was love at first sight for me.\u201d</p><p>I took his hand in mine. \u201cI had to be persuaded that adding another person to my life was a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019ve never seen you happier, seems like it was,\u201d Zerbrowski said.</p> <p>I nodded and kissed Micah.</p><p>\u201cSo you met Nathaniel and Anita at the same time,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cI actually met Nathaniel first,\u201d Micah said.</p><p>\u201cAnd was it love at first sight, too?\u201d</p><p>Micah shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019d never dated a man before, so I didn\u2019t see Nathaniel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your first . . . boyfriend ever?\u201d</p> <p>Micah nodded, smiling, and gave Nathaniel the look that went with the smile, which made them both lean around me and kiss again.</p><p>\u201cYou are all adorable together, but be careful with the public displays of affection around some of the other men, and even some of the wives.\u201d</p><p>Zerbrowski frowned at her. \u201cKatie . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s just the truth. You and Anita must both know what could happen if they did that out in the yard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not in public yet. They\u2019re with friends, with us,\u201d he said.</p><p>I wanted to give Zerbrowski a hug right then, but he was still hugging Katie, and I didn\u2019t want to step farther away from my men in the middle of all this.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right; we live in the Bible belt, Mrs. Zerbrowski. We know we have to be careful in public,\u201d Micah said. His voice was neutral as he said it; if he was insulted it didn\u2019t show in his voice, or face. He was good at hiding his emotions when he had to. We\u2019d both learned to hide.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s our kitchen and just us right now,\u201d Zerbrowski said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be careful around friends.\u201d</p> <p>Micah glanced at Nathaniel, but it was our shared boyfriend who put his arm across his shoulders, drawing him closer. Micah hesitated, but slid his arm around Nathaniel\u2019s waist and his other arm across my shoulders, so we were politely cuddled. Nathaniel kept holding Matthew\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t call me Mrs. Zerbrowski, Micah, that\u2019s for work, and my mother-in-law. Please, it\u2019s Katie, and my smart husband is right, we\u2019re friends, and it shouldn\u2019t matter when you\u2019re with friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that not all the police officers coming today are our friends,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIs Uncle Natty the prince?\u201d Matthew asked. He\u2019d been thinking about what he considered important while the adults had worried about things he took for granted.</p><p>\u201cPrince of what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOf you, your prince, if you\u2019re queen and Uncle Micah is king, then is Natty the prince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, actually, Anita is Prince Charming, but when she got promoted to queen I got the title,\u201d Nathaniel said.</p><p>Matthew frowned at him. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Matthew. Yes, Nathaniel is my prince,\u201d I said.</p><p>My answer seemed to please him, and he let it go. Matthew was teaching me not to overexplain, to explain just enough to make him happy, and not dig the verbal hole deeper. Talking to children is like testifying in court, answer just what\u2019s asked, don\u2019t elaborate, and don\u2019t volunteer information.</p><p>\u201cNathaniel and I won\u2019t kiss in front of the other guests,\u201d Micah said.</p><p>\u201cAww,\u201d Nathaniel said, and did an exaggerated pout at us.</p><p>Matthew said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with kissing?\u201d</p><p>Micah smiled at him. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with kissing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Matthew said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we can explain it to you,\u201d I said. I wanted to be upset with Katie, but I knew the cops that would be here today, and my two boyfriends kissing would not go over well. She was right, but I hated that other people\u2019s insecurities and prejudices made it a risk for the men to touch too much in public. Literally, they risked other men screaming in their faces, or even trying to beat them up.</p><p>\u201cWe still have a few things to finish up so the food will be ready,\u201d Nathaniel said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take Matthew outside.\u201d</p><p>Katie smiled at my prince. \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea. Besides, Zerbrowski is dying to show off his new grill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, he always grills the meat, and he\u2019s never set anything on fire,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cGrilling meat is the only thing he can do without needing a fire extinguisher, but let him near the stove, or oven, and it\u2019s terrible,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI grill vegetables just fine,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you that,\u201d she said, and went up on tiptoe to kiss him.</p><p>Nathaniel kissed me and then Micah good-bye. Normally he would have kissed Micah more thoroughly, because he might not get another chance for hours, but we\u2019d started doing less of the tonsil-cleaning kisses in front of Matthew\u2014not just between the men, but between me and the men, or anyone and anyone. Why? Because Matthew liked to imitate, and he\u2019d gotten sent home with a note from preschool. We\u2019d been left having to explain that certain kinds of kissing was grownup kissing, and he had to be a grownup to do it. He\u2019d accepted our reasoning and filed it away on the same list as driving a car, drinking liquor, or being able to lift weights. It made perfect sense to him that it was just one more thing he wasn\u2019t old enough to do, yet.</p><p>Matthew hugged Nathaniel bye, and took my hand in his, then reached for Micah\u2019s hand. We followed Zerbrowski as he led the way through the house. Matthew was almost skipping between us, excited about meeting other kids, and playing outside. I wished I was as happy about being here. I glanced across at Micah and he met my eyes, both of us still in sunglasses. I thought we\u2019d keep them on; it\u2019s always harder to keep the hurt feelings, or anger, out of your eyes than the rest of you. We\u2019d known that coming here was going to be a test of sorts, and it had been brave of Zerbrowski and Katie to invite us, but she\u2019d already shown that her nerve wasn\u2019t as strong as his. She was a teacher, and he was a cop. Of course, maybe Katie was just being realistic, and it was the rest of us that were fooling ourselves. When you live in a way that\u2019s too different from everyone else, you get grief about it. Is it fair? No, but it\u2019s still what happens. I wanted to go home.</p><p>Zerbrowski led us out the back door onto the deck with the other early arriving guests. There were a half dozen kids already playing in the yard. Matthew was so excited that he jumped up and down to get rid of some of the energy of it. There was no going home, no disappointing the kid, or even Nathaniel, who was finally in the kitchen with the other domestic partners. For our big boy, and our little one, we were going to smile and smile and have a good time even if it killed us. Strike that, no killing today, though depending on the level of stupid aimed at us, I was willing to look at a little mayhem.</p><p>Matthew asked permission to go play, we nodded, and off he went. He joined the running and laughing children as if he\u2019d known them all his life. I\u2019d half expected some hesitation, or shyness, but nope, the other kids accepted him just as easily.</p><p>Zerbrowski opened his new grill and began to wax eloquent about it. Micah and I stood with our arms around each other, pretending we cared\u2014or I pretended, maybe Micah would actually grill meat if we had a grill.</p><p>I got greetings from the other cops of, \u201cHey, Blake . . . Anita, good to see you . . .\u201d then they closed around us introducing me to their wives; so far I was the only female cop here. I introduced Micah as my boyfriend, but felt strange not saying that our third was in the house.</p><p>We got a lot of, \u201cMy husband, my other half, my guy, Dan, Saul . . . didn\u2019t tell me you had a little boy.\u201d</p><p>It took us almost thirty minutes of conversation to try and explain that Matthew wasn\u2019t ours, but he spent a lot of time with us. Once we said that he was our nephew and we were Uncle Micah and Aunt Anita, they accepted it more easily. I\u2019d originally been adamant that we weren\u2019t Matthew\u2019s uncles and aunt, so he couldn\u2019t call us that, but it made him happy, and it made conversations like this much easier. I was tired of the topic long before the other women were, because they asked more questions than the guys. They were men and they were cops, most of that combination learns early not to ask too many personal questions. Micah helped me find a shorthand to explain, \u201cHis mother\u2019s out of town on a business trip, and we\u2019re the only family in town.\u201d</p><p>Then there was more small talk. I met more spouses of fellow officers in the next few minutes than I\u2019d ever met, and because I was the woman they seemed to expect me to be the chatty one. I wasn\u2019t. Both the men with me today were more easily social than I would ever be. Micah did his best to redirect the conversation away from me and to him, but the women just didn\u2019t seem to understand that I was the \u201chusband,\u201d and that our \u201cwife\u201d was actually in the kitchen with Katie. Of course, we didn\u2019t try to explain that part either. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>By the time Micah and I managed to find a way to be by ourselves for a few minutes my nerves were raw and I was sort of clinging to him. I\u2019d forgotten how much I hated get-togethers like this; it was just too many people who were work friends at best, work acquaintances, or near strangers. Touching Micah helped, but it had been years since I\u2019d been at a large party where I didn\u2019t have more of my lovers with me, and those parties had also been vampire and wereanimal events, which meant it wasn\u2019t the same kind of socializing, or they were already my friends. I hadn\u2019t realized how much I relied on touching my lovers, having them help out with the small talk, or having someone to huddle in the corner with and hate the social together. Micah was better at it than I was, but he held me tight, too, his hands stroking my back.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d forgotten how bad I am at these things.\u201d</p> <p>He spoke with his face pressed into the line of my neck. \u201cIf it\u2019s our people it\u2019s refreshing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of these are friends, but they aren\u2019t our people,\u201d I whispered against his hair.</p><p>Micah raised his head up, body tense with listening. \u201cThat\u2019s Matthew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s angry, yelling.\u201d</p> <p>I didn\u2019t ask him how he heard that over the crowd noise. One of the benefits of being a lycanthrope was better hearing, and we\u2019d discovered that the catweres could hear higher noises than the canines. Small children had high-pitched voices.</p><p>We started down the steps of the deck, going for the side yard and the kids, but Zerbrowski called after me. \u201cCan I talk to you a minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just going to check on Matthew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d Micah said, \u201cyou talk cop stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>He came back to the steps and kissed me. \u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p> <p>He started walking through the crowd, leaving me with a stupid grin on my face.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Anita,\u201d Zerbrowski said.</p><p>\u201cSorry, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at me, and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are good together, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>The grin faded around the edges. \u201cBut I need you to see something in the kitchen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs Nathaniel all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019s fine; a lot of the other wives think he\u2019s just fine.\u201d He drew the last \u201cfine\u201d out into that ghetto drawl.</p><p>I frowned at him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed that we\u2019re missing a lot of the wives?\u201d</p><p>I glanced around and it was mostly men, not all, but suddenly a lot. \u201cSo the women have gone inside to talk about things other than guns, sports, and police work. Doesn\u2019t it usually end up divided between cops and non-cops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this early in the day. Come see.\u201d He motioned me to follow him, and I did, wondering what was going on.</p><p>The dining room was what you walked into from the back door, so I could see that the table was covered in food, waiting for Katie to give the \u201ccome and get it.\u201d But I knew that the traffic jam of women spilling out into the dining room from the kitchen hadn\u2019t helped cook, because if all of them had helped, or were helping, the kitchen wouldn\u2019t have been big enough to hold them all. Usually, people ask if they can help and if told no, they go outside and visit, drink a few cold drinks from the cooler.</p><p>I heard Katie\u2019s voice higher than normal, calling out, \u201cLadies, thanks for the offer, but Nathaniel and I have all the help we need.\u201d</p><p>Three women turned and started walking away from the kitchen. They were laughing. A tall brunette said, \u201cI\u2019d love to help Nathaniel out.\u201d</p><p>The shorter brunette woman beside her said, \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t a married woman I\u2019d help him out, all right.\u201d She laughed half nervously.</p><p>The third woman, a blonde, said, \u201cI\u2019m married, not dead, I may still take a run at him.\u201d</p><p>The short brunette gave her a play slap on the arm. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t cheat on Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor that, I might.\u201d Her voice had dropped to a low purr.</p><p>The tall brunette saw us standing there, and touched the other woman\u2019s arm. They looked at us a little startled, probably wondering if we\u2019d heard them.</p><p>\u201cHello, ladies, I\u2019m just checking in with Katie and Anita wanted to check in with Nathaniel. See how our better halves are getting on with the food,\u201d Zerbrowski said.</p><p>By him including his wife and Nathaniel together he made it clear that it was on equal par, wife and . . . partner. The women got it, because they suddenly looked uncomfortable. The blonde decided to tough it out, sticking her chin out definitely, \u201cNathaniel belong to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make him sound like a puppy, but if you mean is he my boyfriend, yeah, he belongs to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m a lucky girl,\u201d I said, and fought not to have my eyes go hostile. Her attitude had already gotten on my nerves.</p><p>\u201cYou really are,\u201d the short brunette said, taking the blonde\u2019s arm and keeping them all moving.</p><p>Zerbrowski leaned in and whispered, \u201cStop glaring at them, just let it go.\u201d</p><p>I turned around so I couldn\u2019t keep looking at the women. \u201cIt\u2019s just the attitude bugs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good-looking guy, Anita.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt still bugs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the way you mean,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one kind of jealousy.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019m not jealous as in seeing the women as competition, or being insecure. I know what I mean to Nathaniel, what we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf a group of strange men had talked about Katie in front of you the way they just talked about Nathaniel in front of me, how would you feel?\u201d</p><p>He stopped walking and just stared into space for a second. He had an odd look on his face. He finally shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019d have been pissed. I might have made a joke to pass it off, but I would have been pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBut you must be used to that at Guilty Pleasures when he dances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that and worse, but that\u2019s at his job. He\u2019s trying to be sexy and lusted after, but not here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he didn\u2019t flirt with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, he\u2019s cooking. He can focus on that the way I do at the shooting range. Second, he wants to fit in here as one of the \u2018wives.\u2019\u201d I made quote marks over the word. \u201cFlirting won\u2019t get him invited to more family-friendly get-togethers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie called me in hoping that the women would be too embarrassed to flirt and loiter in front of another husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it help clear the women out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why fetch me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Katie said to fetch you. She seems to feel that Nathaniel needs some reassurance.\u201d</p><p>There were still too many women in the kitchen. There usually were, at parties like this, because they got tired of the boys club outside, but the energy was different from that. Katie and Nathaniel moved around the kitchen, but the five extra women in the room were in the way.</p><p>Katie said, \u201cElise, can you please move. I need to get something from that cabinet.\u201d</p><p>Elise was a tall woman. She had let her hair go salt and pepper, but her makeup was flawless, and the bones of her face would make her beautiful when she was eighty, which she so wasn\u2019t. She was either a young forty, or a very well-preserved fiftysomething. She moved out of Katie\u2019s way, but only just enough, because two other women were also leaning against the cabinet and there wasn\u2019t room to move without losing her view of Nathaniel washing dishes in the sink. Katie liked to clean as she cooked, and so he was helping do that, too.</p><p>I glanced from the three to the last two women who were near the door. What had Nathaniel done to get this reaction? Yes, he was gorgeous, but this was excessive. He saw me and the relief on his face was clear, at least to me. Something had happened; I didn\u2019t know what, but something.</p><p>I went to him, and he wrapped himself around me, hugging me very tight, and just held on for a few seconds. It reminded me of my reaction outside with the crowd and the questions, when I\u2019d clung to Micah, but Nathaniel was far more social than either of us. He raised back enough for us to kiss. I expected a good but chaste kiss, considering the audience we had. I was wrong.</p><p>He kissed me completely and thoroughly, his fingers digging and kneading into my back, the way a cat will treat a cushion just before the claws come out and it gets shredded. Micah could have brought just his claws out like that, but Nathaniel would have had to lose human form to do it, and I knew his control was better than that. For him to do anything this catlike here meant he was very nervous, the kiss meant nerves, and maybe a need to prove he belonged to me so the other women would back off.</p><p>I was a little stiff at first with the kiss, because it was way too much for me around the other police, or their wives, but his need and his nervousness made me force myself to relax into him. He\u2019d explain later, and it would make sense. I believed that. I believed in him, and knew he\u2019d have a reason for it.</p><p>He drew back and said, softly, \u201cMissed you.\u201d His eyes were uncertain.</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d I said, and smiled at him.</p><p>Whatever he saw in my smile, my face, took the uncertainty out of his eyes, and replaced it with warmth, happiness, and that look we all get when we look at someone we\u2019re in love with, as if a weight that we carried all our lives lifted when we looked into the face of our beloved.</p><p>\u201cWow, wish my husband greeted me at the door like that,\u201d a woman with brown hair in two pigtails, halter top, and shorts said.</p><p>I glanced up to find several of the women looking appreciative, but the energy in the room had changed to something softer. I realized that the energy had been almost predatory, the way it can get at Guilty Pleasures sometimes. Women are more sexually aggressive at strip clubs than men, and their energy can be much angrier. I suddenly realized that one or more of the wives must have recognized Nathaniel from the club. It\u2019s hard for most people to treat you like a real human being once they\u2019ve seen you take your clothes off on stage. The wife, or wives, hadn\u2019t been able to resist telling some of the other women and they\u2019d wanted to see for themselves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If it had been a female stripper recognized by men it would have been much more covert, because a bunch of men standing there gazing at a woman gets creepy pretty fast, but doing it in reverse the women didn\u2019t see themselves as predatory. It never occurred to them that Nathaniel might be just as uncomfortable as a female dancer would be with the treatment. He was a man, men liked attention from women, or that was the thought. Actually, men can get just as embarrassed as women, and be made to feel just as bad about themselves, they\u2019re just not allowed to admit it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your . . .\u201d the elegant Elise said, and she let the sentence trail off as if she wanted me to fill in the blank.</p><p>\u201cBoyfriend,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been living together for three years.\u201d I added that last part to make it clear it wasn\u2019t just hot sex and breathtaking kisses. Duration in a relationship counts for most people, and makes them take it more seriously.</p> <p>\u201cA hello kiss like that after three years together, that\u2019s impressive,\u201d Elise said. Her tone held a certain disdain, nothing I could call her on, but it was there.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been with your husband?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cFive years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d I said, though I wondered why only five years. She had to be over forty and the hair made me want to say fifty, but some people turn gray early, the face certainly didn\u2019t look fifty.</p><p>She gave a small smile. \u201cThank you, Anita; it is Anita Blake, correct?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to finally meet you, after hearing so much about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope it was all good things,\u201d I said, smiling, because I was almost sure it wouldn\u2019t be. My reputation for being the bad girl, or even the cop that shot first and asked questions later, didn\u2019t endear me to everyone with a badge.</p><p>\u201cWhat else would it be?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFood\u2019s up,\u201d Katie said, voice too bright.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it then,\u201d Elise said and glided out of the kitchen, tall and graceful. The other women trailed behind her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was all that about?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt was terrible, they were so rude,\u201d Katie said, and she went to hug Zerbrowski.</p><p>\u201cRude how?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSome of the wives just came in for a quick peek at Nathaniel, and that was all right, but others . . . If it had been men looking at me like that I\u2019d have felt dirty.\u201d She shivered.</p><p>Zerbrowski stroked her hair, as he held her. \u201cYou should have called me in sooner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should have had Anita come in and kiss him sooner,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou have this effect on women often?\u201d Zerbrowski asked.</p><p>Katie raised her head from his chest and said, \u201cNathaniel was a perfect gentleman. He didn\u2019t do anything to start this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, I did, Katie, just not today,\u201d Nathaniel said.</p><p>They looked at him. I just raised my head and looked up at him while still in his arms. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve seen me strip. Most people have trouble treating dancers like real people once they\u2019ve seen them take their clothes off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeeing you on stage shouldn\u2019t have made them be so rude at our party,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>Nathaniel shifted in my arms and I knew there was more. \u201cWhat is it, Nathaniel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked a bachelorette party for one of the wives.\u201d He very carefully didn\u2019t say which wife. He would keep his customers secrets even if they didn\u2019t keep his.</p><p>\u201cWhy does that matter? It\u2019s still your job and this was my home. It\u2019s disrespectful to us, as well as you.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel looked down and met my eyes. It was a mute appeal. \u201cI take it that it was a very lucrative party for you?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey got their money\u2019s worth, I take it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>I glanced at Zerbrowski. \u201cYou ever go to any private bachelor parties that had strippers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said.</p><p>Katie frowned at him. \u201cYou always tell me, don\u2019t tease Anita right now.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d gotten a lap dance from a stripper and then she showed up as the girlfriend of one of the cops you knew, how would you react?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be nice,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wonder if the cop knew that his girlfriend used to strip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome cops date strippers,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but they don\u2019t usually bring them to family-friendly parties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can date strippers, but you don\u2019t bring them home to meet the family,\u201d Nathaniel said. He sounded sad.</p><p>I hugged him tight. \u201cYou are my family.\u201d</p><p>He rewarded me with that brilliant smile of his, the real one, not the practiced one that the customers thought was the real deal. If he could have looked at them like that on cue he\u2019d have gotten more hundred-dollar tips than he already did.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way, Nathaniel. I know you\u2019re Anita\u2019s family,\u201d Zerbrowski said.</p><p>Nathaniel wasted some of the smile in his direction. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Then Katie got a strange look on her face, and she paled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Zerbrowski asked.</p><p>\u201cAges ago, they tried to tell me about a bachelorette party that a bunch of the wives went to when Rosetti was about to marry. They told me some details and . . . I told them to stop, I didn\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d She looked at Nathaniel.</p><p>He was very still against me. I looked up at him. His face was guarded, as if he were waiting for something bad to happen.</p><p>\u201cThat was you they were talking about?\u201d Katie asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d he said, softly.</p><p>She blinked at him, brown eyes very wide. \u201cBut they said . . . you . . .\u201d She blushed from neck to the roots of her hair. She finally hid her face against Zerbrowski.</p><p>\u201cWhatever they said, I did not have sex with anyone at the party.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head from Zerbrowski\u2019s chest and blinked at him. The look was enough to say that was exactly what she\u2019d been told.</p><p>\u201cThe stories grow in the telling sometimes, but whatever they\u2019ve decided to tell people, sex did not happen. Now, here I am in person, and every woman who heard the story will be wondering if it was true; some were drunk enough they may believe what they were told happened, and whoever lied the most will be freaking out that I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Katie mastered herself enough to say, \u201cI just need a minute. If you could set the rest of the food on the table and watch the pasta in the oven, I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Katie went out the door with a bemused Zerbrowski trailing after her.</p><p>I looked up at Nathaniel. \u201cIf you say you didn\u2019t have sex, I believe you, but what did you do at the party that was so share-worthy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing illegal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew that, silly you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou never think less of me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother you to know that at least five women here have seen me naked.\u201d</p><p>In my head I thought, since you did a few pornographic movies before we met, there might be a lot more people who have seen you naked, but I didn\u2019t say that out loud. If I brought that up, we\u2019d fight, or he\u2019d get his feelings more hurt than they already were, and that wasn\u2019t what I wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t take your G-string off in the club,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cFor enough money I do at private parties.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t known that, and fought to keep my face from showing it. Then I thought of something else. \u201cDid the lap dances start before or after your thong came off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost before, but the bride got one after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must have been tricky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLap dances without clothes are always tricky,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you upset?\u201d</p><p>I honestly wasn\u2019t sure, but the only answer I had was, \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look completely happy,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, how long ago was this party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year ago, maybe a little longer.\u201d His face was very careful as he said it, watching my face for anger. He watched sometimes like that, waiting for me or Micah to get mad at him. He\u2019d been physically abused as a child, and by age seven he\u2019d had to run away after witnessing his older brother\u2019s murder. He\u2019d asked me once if there was a time limit on how long someone could be convicted for murder. I\u2019d told him, no, a person could always been charged for murder, unlike rape, or child abuse, which does have to be reported as a crime within a set number of years. Nathaniel had nodded, and filed the thought away. I didn\u2019t push. His therapist said that Nathaniel had blocked out most of his early childhood in order to survive. What he did remember was so terrible it worried me; I mean, how bad could the rest be? Fresh on the streets at age seven, Nathaniel had been found by a man who liked little boys; he\u2019d fed him, clothed him, taken care of him, and before the age of ten he had pimped him out. Saying Nathaniel had a hard childhood was like saying World War II was a small border dispute. Becoming a headliner at Guilty Pleasures had been such a climb up the social ladder that it seemed wrong to bitch about a little nudity. If things had gone differently and he\u2019d never been found by the local wereleopards, Nathaniel would probably have died of a drug overdose before he ever reached seventeen. The wereleopards had insisted he be drug-free before they made him one of them. I was very glad that he\u2019d lived for us to meet, and that he was in my life.</p><p>\u201cSo the bachelorette party was after we were living together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, face, voice, body language very careful.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I mean, it\u2019s weird that the bride and her friends are here, but it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s your job. You\u2019ve been a good sport about me being shot, stabbed, and nearly dying at my job, so I need to man-up and be a good sport about your stuff.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re really not mad about it?\u201d</p><p>I licked my lips, and tried to think how to word it. \u201cI\u2019m not mad. It\u2019s just weird and I\u2019m not sure how to act around the women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is weird, and me either,\u201d he said.</p> <p>I smiled at him. \u201cOkay then, we\u2019ll figure it out together, but we should tell Micah when we get outside.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel agreed, and hugged me, smiling. \u201cThen help me set the food on the table. I\u2019ll check on the ziti in the oven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaked ziti, why is it that no party in St. Louis can skip the baked ziti, or baked mostaccioli?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He grinned at me. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m not going to let it burn.\u201d He was already turning to the stove. I started to grab one of the dishes off the kitchen island, but felt the heat in time. I grabbed two potholders lying on the island and carried the dish of baked beans into the other room. I was going to have to remember that a lot of things were too hot to touch without cover. How did I feel about the fact that there were other women here who had seen my love naked? That wasn\u2019t the right question. Nathaniel was like most wereanimals; he didn\u2019t see anything wrong with nudity, so a lot of people had seen him nude. How did I feel knowing there was at least one woman here who\u2019d had a naked lap dance from my sweetie? Nope, still not the right question. I knew that Nathaniel had been far from virgin when we first met. Hell, the first time we met he\u2019d still been working as a high-class call boy, though it beat being a street prostitute, which was where he\u2019d started before someone saw his potential and moved him up. There\u2019d been more than one reason that it had taken a few years for Nathaniel to convince me to date him.</p><p>No, what bothered me was that people had told intimate details about my lover while he was nude and being all sexy. That bothered me, and I knew it was stupid, because lots of his customers talked about him. Hell, there was a blog that encouraged women to wax eloquent about him as his stage name, Brandon, and about other dancers at Guilty Pleasures, to help drum up business. \u201cSee what a good time we had with Brandon at Guilty Pleasures\u201d\u2014but that had been distant. I didn\u2019t read the comments, because he was my boyfriend. I\u2019d learned not to take the customers at the club too seriously if I visited on nights that he was working. I\u2019d even been out on a date with him in the past when he\u2019d been recognized by customers, so why did this bother me?</p> <p>I didn\u2019t have a good answer, so I acknowledged that it did bother me and put it away. I\u2019d think about it until we had some privacy to talk about it. I think my request was no more cops\u2019 wives. Was that a reasonable request? I didn\u2019t know, so I kept my mouth shut and helped put food out on the table while Nathaniel moved easily and happily around Katie\u2019s kitchen.</p><p>We finally got outside on the deck and were standing hand in hand when we spotted Micah moving his way through the crowd. We waved and he smiled when he saw us, but suddenly our view was blocked by a large man. He was six feet, broad shouldered, and just a big guy. Large hands were already clenching into fists over and over, almost the way that Nathaniel had been kneading my back, and in a way the hand thing was a way of showing nerves, a fight for control, just like the kneading had been. But this guy wasn\u2019t a wereleopard, he was just that angry.</p><p>I heard a woman\u2019s voice behind him. \u201cClint, don\u2019t, please don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The man was so broad that I couldn\u2019t see around him to the woman, he just blocked out everything standing too close. I moved Nathaniel slightly behind me and he let me do it. I appreciated the men in my life who weren\u2019t fighters, and who would let me step up for them.</p><p>\u201cJefferson, right?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cGet out of the way, Blake, I got no beef with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re threatening my boyfriend, then we got beef.\u201d</p><p>Zerbrowski was beside us. \u201cMy house, my rules, Clint, no fighting.\u201d His voice was light, almost cheerful, a tone to calm things down.</p><p>Clint\u2019s voice growled out from between his teeth, his rage was nearly touchable. \u201cHe fucked my wife; I\u2019m going to fuck him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Nathaniel said.</p><p>I kept my eyes front on Clint\u2019s very big center of body. Before an arm, a hand, a leg, anything could move, his center had to move, so that\u2019s what I watched. I was already in a subtle fighting stance, which meant I was set to go, but trying not to look like I was ready.</p><p>\u201cYou calling my wife a liar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe may have been too drunk to remember everything, but I swear that we didn\u2019t have sex.\u201d</p><p>Zerbrowski stepped in, not exactly between us, but close, and spoke low. \u201cClint, I was at your bachelor party, I know what you did with your stripper.\u201d</p> <p>Clint frowned and looked at Zerbrowski. It was like watching a small mountain turn. Zerbrowski was five foot seven, but he looked frail standing next to Clint. I must have looked minuscule.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean, Zerbrowski.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do, or were you so drunk that you don\u2019t remember what happened that night?\u201d His voice wasn\u2019t cheerful anymore, but low and serious. His face matched his voice, and you could suddenly see the cop who had spent over a decade backing down bad guys.</p><p>\u201cI remember,\u201d Clint said, sullenly. His body was relaxing, the rage fading.</p><p>Zerbrowski was almost whispering now, I doubt that anyone but the four of us could hear. \u201cDid you tell your wife what you did?\u201d</p><p>Clint took a step back, his hands relaxed a little. \u201cYou threatening to tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and you\u2019re not going to start a fight at my house either, are you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo, not here.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t like the sound of that, and was debating if I had a threat that might keep him from getting in Nathaniel\u2019s face at the club, but Nathaniel had something better\u2014the truth.</p><p>\u201cYour wife got a lap dance, she didn\u2019t try for more, but she had a friend that did. The other woman got pissed that I wouldn\u2019t sleep with her, not even for the money she was offering. Just by the way she acted in the kitchen I\u2019m betting that she started the rumor, and must have terrified your wife into thinking she\u2019d cheated. I swear to you that all I did was my job, and that doesn\u2019t include actual sex with anyone.\u201d</p><p>Clint was studying Nathaniel as if he\u2019d not really looked at him before except as a handsome man who had crossed the line with his wife. Now, he saw him as something more, though he wasn\u2019t sure exactly what. They were such different kinds of men.</p><p>A thin, petite blonde woman crept up beside Clint. Her makeup was smeared with tears, and her gray eyes were wide and frightened. She started to reach out to touch Clint\u2019s arm, then let her hand fall back before she\u2019d finished the gesture.</p><p>She looked at Nathaniel. \u201cYou\u2019re telling the truth, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to you: it was a hell of a lap dance, but it wasn\u2019t that good a lap dance.\u201d</p><p>She started to cry softly, and managed to say, \u201cWhy would Elise tell me that what I remembered had only been part of it? Why would she want me to think that we\u2019d . . . That\u2019d I\u2019d been so drunk that I . . .\u201d She put her hands over her face and just cried.</p><p>The elegant Elise from the kitchen had been the bride\u2019s \u201cfriend.\u201d She\u2019d been creepy in the kitchen, apparently she was always creepy.</p><p>Clint put his arm around her thin shoulders, and he looked too massive for her, as if the weight of his hand should crush her. \u201cElise\u2019s the one who told me that the stripper you\u2019d fucked was here. I\u2019m sorry, Crystal, I shouldn\u2019t have believed that evil bitch.\u201d</p><p>Crystal snuggled against him, still crying.</p><p>\u201cWhy would she lie?\u201d Clint asked to no one in particular.</p><p>\u201cLook at it this way,\u201d Nathaniel said. \u201cI was living with Anita when I was hired for your bride\u2019s party. If she found out I was doing customers she wouldn\u2019t forgive that. I wouldn\u2019t risk her being that angry at me, not for anyone.\u201d</p><p>Clint looked at me, then at Nathaniel. \u201cBlake does have a reputation. I guess you wouldn\u2019t want her mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know,\u201d I said, \u201cbut why would Elise want Crystal to think she cheated on you? Why would she want to start a fight here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome women like to stir the shit, Anita,\u201d Zerbrowski said. \u201cElise\u2019s always been one of those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you known her long?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cLong enough to know that Nathaniel isn\u2019t the first guy she\u2019s propositioned, but he may be one of the few who turned her down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIn that cold, wicked witch of the north sort of way,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s not my type either,\u201d I said.</p><p>Crystal said, \u201cShe tortured me with the thought that I cheated on you. Why would she hate me like that?\u201d</p><p>Clint went very still, and had a strange look on his face. Crystal couldn\u2019t see it, probably just as well. I wondered if Clint was one of the men that Elise had propositioned. Somehow I wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d turned her down, but it was so not my problem.</p><p>Zerbrowski had caught it, because he said, \u201cElise\u2019s always been mean, even to her friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople like that don\u2019t have friends, just victims they hang around with,\u201d I said.</p><p>Zerbrowski nodded. \u201cTrue.\u201d</p><p>Clint and Crystal made up, and she walked away with her husband, relieved, with the tears still drying on her face. Micah walked onto the deck and joined us.</p><p>\u201cI thought me joining the group might confuse things,\u201d he said, and took my hand on the opposite side from Nathaniel.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d stepped into Clint at the wrong time, the fight would have been on,\u201d Zerbrowski said.</p><p>I kissed Micah. \u201cI like that you only ride to the rescue when you\u2019re needed.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou were all doing fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was Matthew upset about?\u201d I asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe other boys were teasing him for being in dance instead of T-ball, or martial arts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made sure the little girls heard our discussion. Most of them are in dance and there aren\u2019t enough boys in any dance school, as I\u2019ve learned from Nathaniel and Jason and all the others going to class.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel grinned. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the girls wanting to dance with Matthew.\u201d</p> <p>Micah nodded happily. He turned to Zerbrowski. \u201cYour Kaitlin is how old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s quite taken with Matthew, and sad that he\u2019s too short to partner her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we take Kaitlin to the ballet she always comes out asking, \u2018Where are the boys for me to dance with?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re playing little league, or taking martial arts,\u201d Micah said.</p> <p>People were drifting past us with plates loaded with food. \u201cTime to finally eat some of the food you\u2019ve been making,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got boys here,\u201d Nathaniel said.</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t dance with the girls,\u201d Zerbrowski said.</p><p>\u201cBet they will,\u201d Nathaniel said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the bet?\u201d Zerbrowski asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I can get a boy besides Matthew to dance with one of the little girls, you do the rest of the dishes after the party.\u201d</p> <p>Zerbrowski studied his face. \u201cAnd if I win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do the dishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were going to help do the dishes anyway,\u201d Zerbrowski said.</p><p>Nathaniel shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s what I could think of, and dishes are the one chore I don\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>Zerbrowski grinned. \u201cOkay, you\u2019re on.\u201d He held his hand out and they shook on it. It was a bet.</p><p>Zerbrowski and Katie had rented tables and awnings for the yard. They were on the opposite side from the area they\u2019d left open for the kids to play, and where the swing set was. The size of the yard had been one of their main deciding factors in buying the house, and today showed why.</p><p>There was a kid\u2019s table just like at family reunions when I was little. Matthew was sitting between two little girls, one blonde and curly, the other with brown hair done in braided pigtails. He was chatting happily. The blonde was answering him back; pigtails seemed quieter, just listening. It was weird to have a kid to keep track of at an event like this; hell, it was weird not to be solo. I\u2019d been part of a \u201ccouple\u201d for years, but rarely felt welcome to bring my multiple people to ordinary get-togethers like today.</p><p>Micah leaned in from his seat beside me, and asked, \u201cWhat are you thinking about so hard?\u201d</p> <p>I smiled at him. \u201cIt\u2019s just weird to have someone sitting at the kid\u2019s table that\u2019s mine, ours, to keep track of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird bad, or weird good?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I poked a fork into the food on my plate, trying to think the question through rather than just answering it. \u201cGood, I think.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel leaned in from the other side of me, resting his cheek against my hair for a second, before he said, \u201cI love having Matthew here, and he\u2019s really enjoying the other kids.\u201d</p><p>I agreed that was true. I tensed a little, waiting for him to push on the whole baby thing. He\u2019d made no bones about the fact that he wanted us to have kids. He\u2019d volunteered to give up his job and be a full-time stay-at-home dad.</p><p>The woman with the brown pigtails who had been part of the group in the kitchen sat down in an empty spot across the table from us. I tried not to tense up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about earlier, I didn\u2019t realize you had a kid. What\u2019s his name? Our Becky and he are getting along really well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Nathaniel said.</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Matthew,\u201d Micah said.</p><p>I waited for one of them to explain that he wasn\u2019t \u201cours,\u201d while I worked through the whole idea of this strange woman having seen my sweetie naked and nearly having sex with another stranger. I was okay with Nathaniel\u2019s job most of the time, but every once in a while it got beyond my comfort zone, and I was left not sure how to feel, or act, or . . . It was just one of those weird moments.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jamie, Jamie Appleton, my husband Kevin is around here somewhere.\u201d She looked up as if trying to spot him, and finally found him on the deck with Zerbrowski and a knot of other men talking and laughing. She pointed out a tall man with short, nearly black hair. \u201cThat\u2019s Kevin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s he work?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in vice, right now, but he\u2019s looking to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere does he want to transfer to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHomicide, or preternatural,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ah, I was seeing why she was sitting with us now, and why she\u2019d apologized. She was doing politics for her husband like a good spouse does, and I was in a position to give a good word for Kevin Appleton to the preternatural squad if I wasn\u2019t pissed about the whole lusting-after-my-boyfriend thing earlier. Or maybe Jamie really was sorry, and especially so because our \u201ckids\u201d were playing together. Maybe, and maybe Santa Claus was a friend of mine, or was I being too cynical? Maybe, but I doubted it.</p><p>\u201cHow long has he been in vice?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cFive years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost people need a change after that long,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWould you want to transfer?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I thought about it, and finally said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure. My skill sets are a little specialized to work anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>One of the little girls shrieked. It made us all look up. The little boy across from Matthew was trying to hit him, but the table was too wide, so he\u2019d climbed onto the table and headed for Matthew.</p><p>The three of us were up and moving toward the fight, as were a lot of the adults. Matthew got up from the table and tried to avoid the other boy, but he\u2019d waited too long, and the other boy launched himself at Matthew and down they went.</p><p>It was Zerbrowski\u2019s son, Greg, who got there first, because he\u2019d been forced to sit at the little kids table; at twelve he had resented it. He grabbed a glass of ice water and dumped it on the fighters. By the time we got there, any adult got there, the little boys were silent, wet, and panting, still entangled, but not really fighting anymore.</p><p>I picked up Matthew and a man I didn\u2019t know got the other little boy. They both had dark straight hair, olive complexions, and the same bone structure; other than the man having pale gray eyes and the boy having brown they looked like mirrors of each other.</p><p>Matthew was crying, arms locked around my neck. His curls and shirt were damp as he clung to me. \u201cMatthew, are you hurt?\u201d I asked. I wanted to make him let go so I could check him for injuries, but somehow it seemed more important to hold him right at that moment.</p><p>Jamie Appleton was holding her little girl, Becky. Her face had blood on it. I was betting the other little boy\u2019s foot had caught her as he went over the table. Kevin Appleton was making his way through the crowd.</p><p>Nathaniel was patting Matthew\u2019s hair, trying to get him to look up so we could see him better. Micah hovered around us all, but he kept his attention on the other father. I realized that it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that the fight could spread from the children to the adults. It was stupid of me to let my guard down just because I had a little kid wrapped around me crying, but it was like the feel of him in my arms had hit a switch and all I could think of was, Is Matthew hurt? Is he okay? Other than looking at the boy and man, I hadn\u2019t really seen them as a threat. Stupid, but luckily Micah hadn\u2019t forgotten that everyone can be a potential threat under the right circumstances.</p><p>The dark-haired boy was bigger than Matthew, but I wasn\u2019t sure he was older. The man was asking him, \u201cWhat happened? You know the rules on fighting, Cyrus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gay,\u201d Cyrus said, and his face was hateful as he said it.</p><p>The man looked embarrassed. \u201cCyrus, apologize.\u201d</p><p>Matthew raised a tear-stained face from my shoulder. \u201cGay isn\u2019t bad,\u201d he said, his lower lip still quivering, tears still trailing down his face.</p><p>The father asked, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>Micah said, \u201cWe\u2019ve taught Matthew that no sexual orientation is bad, it\u2019s just the way that people come into this world.\u201d</p><p>The man stared at Micah. \u201cWhy would you . . .\u201d Then he looked from Micah to Nathaniel and me. \u201cOh, yeah, I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgot what?\u201d I asked, and my tone was enough to make Micah touch my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThat everyone says your boyfriends are . . .\u201d He stopped as if not sure how to finish the sentence.</p><p>\u201cMy boyfriends are what?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not do this in front of the kids,\u201d he said.</p><p>I said, \u201cWe\u2019re teaching Matthew that no sexual orientation is bad, and that love between consenting adults is always precious and should be valued. What are you teaching little Cyrus?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s face clouded up, the beginnings of anger, or maybe I\u2019d hit a sore spot.</p><p>Kevin Appleton was holding a napkin to his little girl\u2019s nose. \u201cYour kid bloodied my little girl. What kind of boy kicks a girl in the face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyrus, did you kick her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Daddy, I don\u2019t hit girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did, too,\u201d Becky said, pushing her father\u2019s hand away, so she could point a dramatic finger. \u201cHe kicked me, in the face!\u201d</p><p>Zerbrowski and Katie were there now, trying to figure out what to do with their guests, but it was their son, Greg, who said, \u201cExcuse me, excuse me, everybody.\u201d</p><p>Zerbrowski had to use his cop voice to say, \u201cEverybody shut up for a minute.\u201d</p><p>We all looked at him.</p><p>Greg looked a little uncomfortable with everyone staring at him. He had his father\u2019s dark curls, but Katie\u2019s delicate bone structure, so he was a pretty kid, and looked even younger than twelve. \u201cI know what started the fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell us?\u201d Zerbrowski said, his hand on his son\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cCyrus here told Matthew that only gay boys played with girls. Matthew said that he liked to play with girls and boys. He totally didn\u2019t get that he was being insulted. Cyrus asked, \u2018What does that mean?\u2019 The little blonde girl told Cyrus that he was being boring just like at school and kissed Matthew on the cheek, that\u2019s when Cyrus tried to hit him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cyrus\u2019s father looked at his son. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>Cyrus wouldn\u2019t look at his dad, or anyone else.

It was a very firm word, he meant it.</p><p>\u201cCyrus, apologize, now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you told him what he\u2019s apologizing for,\u201d Nathaniel said.</p><p>The father looked puzzled. \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s apologizing for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he apologizing for the fight, trying to call Matthew bad names, or being jealous?\u201d Nathaniel asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even understand that,\u201d the man said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sorry you called Matthew names?\u201d Nathaniel asked.</p><p>Cyrus looked daggers at him, but finally said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I called you names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you accept his apology?\u201d I asked, Matthew softly.</p> <p>Matthew nodded.</p><p>\u201cAre you sorry you started the fight?\u201d Nathaniel asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I fought you, Matthew.\u201d</p><p>Matthew shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that. If Becky cannot accept your \u2019pology, I don\u2019t accept it either.\u201d</p><p>Someone had found ice to put on Becky\u2019s face. She was crying again, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s cold!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re really sorry, aren\u2019t we, Cyrus?\u201d his father said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cyrus said sullenly.</p><p>\u201cCan you behave yourself the rest of the day, or do we have to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen promise me, no more fighting.\u201d</p><p>He promised, but not like he was happy about it, or really meant it. We\u2019d keep a closer eye on Matthew, just in case. Didn\u2019t want to give him back to his mother damaged.</p><p>They went one way. We went the other. I told Greg, \u201cThat was quick thinking about the water.\u201d</p><p>He flashed me a grin that was the duplicate of Zerbrowski\u2019s shit-eating one, and suddenly he was so his father\u2019s son. It made me smile just to see it.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Anita.\u201d</p><p>Zerbrowski hugged him one armed from behind, because he was getting too big for a public hug. \u201cThat\u2019s my boy.\u201d They grinned at each other, and it was a good moment.</p><p>The curly-haired blonde came over with a woman in tow who was as blonde and blue-eyed as she was. \u201cMommy, this is Matthew, he takes ballet just like I do, and he fought Cyrus for me.\u201d</p><p>I was pretty sure that Matthew hadn\u2019t seen himself as defending the little blonde\u2019s honor. I started to say something, but Matthew was looking entirely too pleased with himself for me to spoil the moment.</p><p>The girl was Jeannette, the mother was Jean, and the father was Detective Mitchell Forbes. Forbes had lost most of his hair, so I added five years onto his age, but when I had more time to look at his face, and the toned body that showed in his polo shirt and shorts, I subtracted the five years and put him early thirties at most.</p><p>\u201cThank you for taking care of our little girl, Matthew. It was very brave of you.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about these assumed dynamics, that the girl needed saving and that the boy did the saving. It seemed sexist and under six there really wasn\u2019t much difference in physical potential. Jeannette could have \u201cprotected\u201d herself as well as Matthew, with training in martial arts maybe better.</p><p>\u201cYou know, girls can protect themselves,\u201d I said.</p><p>Jeanette and Jean looked at me as if I were speaking in tongues, blinking big, blue eyes at me. Then Jean wrapped her free hand through her husband\u2019s muscular arm, still holding Jeannette\u2019s hand in her other.</p><p>\u201cMitchell and I met because a man got out of hand in a bar and Mitchell saved me. I didn\u2019t even know he was a cop then, just that he was this big, strong, commanding guy.\u201d She smiled up at him with so much love in her face, and he smiled down at her with the same warmth showing. It was a good look, so why did it bug me?</p><p>Nathaniel wrapped his arm across my shoulders. \u201cAnita rescued me . . . from myself.\u201d I think he added the last so they wouldn\u2019t ask what I had rescued him from. Some of the rescuing had included me killing people, which the police tended to frown on.</p><p>I turned and smiled up at him. \u201cThanks, pussycat, but you\u2019ve saved me, too.\u201d</p><p>He kissed me then, and I realized that it was true. He had picked up a gun and shot someone to save me once, but he\u2019d saved me in so many other ways. Can you really rescue anyone, or anything, without rescuing a piece of yourself at the same time?</p><p>Matthew hugged us both, wrapping his small arms around our necks before we\u2019d moved apart. We hugged him back, Nathaniel\u2019s arms wrapping around me as I held the little guy. Micah\u2019s hand came up to touch the side of his still-damp curls, and Nathaniel opened his arm enough to let Micah into the hug.</p><p>Matthew chimed out, \u201cGroup hug!\u201d in a happy voice.</p><p>It made the whole Forbes family laugh. Jeannette said, \u201cPick me up, Daddy; I want a group hug, too.\u201d That made all the adults laugh, and the Forbeses did their own group hug.</p><p>We ended up with a play date with Jeannette Forbes and Becky Appleton. They were both five and in kindergarten, older women. Matthew was precocious.</p><p>The first lightning bugs came out, and the children ran trying to catch them. It seemed like there were more of the twinkling bugs when I was a little girl. Was that just nostalgia on my part, or truth? I wondered if anyone had done a study on it somewhere. I\u2019d look online and see.</p><p>I made sure all the kids knew that fireflies were catch-and-release only, and that no one tore the insects\u2019 bright abdomens off and pressed them to their skin like macabre jewelry. I\u2019d done that once as a child and felt horrible afterwards. The other kids hadn\u2019t understood why it bothered me, but now I could explain to the next generation that lightning bugs were for looking at, not tearing apart.</p><p>Micah had helped me wrangle the kids chasing fireflies so the ones even younger than Matthew could have a chance to see the blinking lights up close or even have them crawl over small toddler hands. I wasn\u2019t sure where Nathaniel had gotten to, until he came out to the yard and knelt whispering to Matthew. His grin showed in the soft light from the deck. After speaking to Matthew he went up to Becky and Jeannette first, then some of the other girls, and they scattered back through the other children saying something I didn\u2019t quite catch. Then most of the children between three and ten ran toward the house. The number of boys went down as the ages went up, and the numbers of girls remained the same. In fact some of the older boys looked offended. I had a clue what Nathaniel and Matthew were up to, and Micah and I trailed behind them, holding hands.</p><p>Katie, Zerbrowski, and both their children were in the living room with the furniture pushed back against the walls so that the hardwood floor was clear and gleaming under the overhead lights.</p><p>Nathaniel had taken his shoes off, and said, \u201cKaitlin and I have already stretched.\u201d He held his hand out.</p><p>Kaitlin Zerbrowski had changed into tights, ballet shoes, and a gauzy overskirt. She\u2019d put her long brown hair, so like her mother\u2019s, up in a high, tight ponytail. She looked taller, leaner, in the outfit and moved gracefully to take Nathaniel\u2019s hand.</p><p>Zerbrowski used a remote to turn on the sound system that went with the big-screen TV, but worked just fine with the speakers scattered throughout the room, too. Ballet music that I didn\u2019t recognize was suddenly everywhere in gorgeous surround sound.</p><p>Nathaniel and Kaitlin began to dance. He had partnered some of the older girls at the ballet school where he took lessons, and I knew that he and Kaitlin had come up with some simple choreography. I was betting this was recital music she was already practicing to, and Nathaniel was a quick study. He held her hand while she went up on pointe. He went down on one knee so she could do a beautiful arabesque. He stood and helped her balance for pirouettes. All the while he moved gracefully beside her, and at the end he lifted her overhead, one armed. Kaitlin held her body in perfect position while he did it, which showed that she had core strength that didn\u2019t show in her slender frame. He walked carefully, easily in a small circle around the room, before spilling her through his arms so that she came back to pointe on the floor again.</p><p>The music stopped and everyone applauded. We had quite an audience by that time. Kaitlin was smiling as big as I\u2019d ever seen her, glowing with it. Nathaniel went down on his knees so she could hug him, then she ran to her mother. \u201cMommy, I told you I could do it! I told you, if I had someone to hold me I could do it just like a real dancer!\u201d</p><p>Zerbrowski shook Nathaniel\u2019s hand and did that one-armed guy hug. \u201cI know this is a dastardly plan to win our bet, but it\u2019s worth it to see her that happy.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel grinned at him. Matthew was sitting on the floor struggling with his double-tied Spider-Man tennis shoes. Micah helped him take them off, and when he was barefoot he ran to Nathaniel. He picked him up and then said, \u201cWhoever wants to dance has to stretch out.\u201d</p><p>The little girls ran en masse toward them. The boys held back. It was Jeannette of the blonde curls who grabbed one of the boys and pulled him into the group. Kaitlin went through the boys between eight and teens and looked them over like she was at a used car dealership. She declared, \u201cYou look in good enough shape.\u201d Or, \u201cYou think you\u2019re strong enough to do this?\u201d I was betting that Nathaniel had coached her in the social verbiage as much as the dancing. Greg Zerbrowski got some of the oldest boys on the floor. I couldn\u2019t hear what he said to them, but they gave covert looks to some of the older girls who had walked onto the floor in graceful, laughing groups. Learn to dance, and you can hold girls close without anyone getting mad at you. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They coaxed, bullied, and embarrassed a surprising number of the boys onto the floor. Among them was Cyrus, who Jeannette had dragged onto the floor personally, which meant to me that she knew exactly the effect she had on the little boy. It made me wonder if she\u2019d kissed Matthew to start the fight. Surely not. She couldn\u2019t be that aware this early, could she?</p><p>Nathaniel and Kaitlin led the stretching and limbering. One of the oldest boys, about fourteen, said, \u201cThis is some of the stuff we do before baseball practice.\u201d</p><p>Nathaniel said, \u201cDancing is athletic and you want to stretch out just like you do for baseball, or any other sport.\u201d</p> <p>The stretching reminded the boys of a lot of their sports practices and seemed to put them more at ease. Zerbrowski put on more music and this time Nathaniel and Kaitlin helped Matthew and Becky through a short dance. He braced Becky while she went up on tiptoes, one arm trying to form that round, half circle of arm movement that is one of the first things you learn in ballet, or try to learn. Matthew did his part as the guy half of a ballet couple, which meant he was mostly a prop for the girl, but he did it to the best of his ability, face serious.</p><p>Jeannette wanted her turn next with Matthew. She was a little more graceful than Becky, but she was also taller, so it was harder for Matthew to partner her. Nathaniel picked the taller, beefier Cyrus out of the watching boys.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d Cyrus said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a better height for Jeannette, and you\u2019ve watched Matthew do it, just try and Kaitlin and I will spot you.\u201d</p><p>It was Jeannette coming and taking his hand that persuaded Cyrus to try. Nathaniel helped Cyrus figure out how to stand, how to hold his ballet partner, and Cyrus gave it the same serious-faced concentration that Matthew had. He was actually able to go down on one knee and brace her while she went up on that classic one-legged stance. She was only on tiptoe, not pointe, but the lines of her body were all there. I wondered how long she\u2019d been taking lessons.</p> <p>Kaitlin showed some of the younger boys some basic moves, while Nathaniel paired off the older kids. Greg Zerbrowski managed to magically appear beside a tall, leggy girl who was probably three years older, but most of the older boys were still making fun of it all, so he was the tallest one willing to come forward.</p><p>The girl went up on pointe even without the special shoes to make it happen. You could see the muscles in her thighs and calves like magic under her shorts. Greg held her, braced her, and his body damn near vibrated with the effort to hold on, to give every ounce of strength he had to staying with her. He didn\u2019t have a dance background so he couldn\u2019t \u201cdance\u201d with her, but by God he was a good prop for her to show how well she danced.</p><p>Greg was sweating and out of breath by the time they took their bows, but the girl hugged him tight and said, \u201cThat was great, if you took lessons you could dance with us!\u201d</p><p>He blushed, and looked so like his father that it made me grin. One of the oldest boys there that night, sixteen and bulked from weight lifting, probably football, or wrestling for his sport, stepped up next. He had the strength that Greg hadn\u2019t grown into yet, and he held his ballerina easily, though he was less fluid; he definitely didn\u2019t dance, but he was great at holding, bracing, and helping her dance. At the end his ballerina asked if Nathaniel could lift her, because she\u2019d never had anyone strong enough to do it before.</p><p>The boy had said, \u201cCan you show me?\u201d So Nathaniel lifted the girl first, her fall of nearly black hair spilling down his arm as she bowed above him, holding the pose and proving just how strong she was, because holding your body in space like that is one of the hardest things you can do. Then he helped the ballerina and her partner do the move.</p><p>He spotted them, so that if she got dropped she wouldn\u2019t get hurt. The first few times the move wasn\u2019t quite right, so they kept practicing until the lift was strong and sure, and he could hold her almost as steady as Nathaniel had.</p> <p>When they were done and he helped his ballerina to her feet, the kid said, \u201cMy arms feel like they do after lifting heavy weights. That was a serious workout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lifting a whole person above your head, and making it look graceful and fluid while you do it,\u201d Nathaniel said.</p><p>\u201cWow, is all I can say. I can feel my arm muscles twitching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means you gave it your all,\u201d Nathaniel said.</p><p>The dark-haired ballerina laid a kiss on the kid\u2019s cheek. \u201cThank you so much, I wish we had guys in our school that were as strong as you.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, and said, \u201cWhere do you take lessons?\u201d</p><p>The dastardly plan worked better than expected. I heard several little boys asking for dance lessons, and talking about how hard it had been and that they wanted to be stronger so they could lift the girl.</p><p>The music changed to something slow and not ballet. Zerbrowski took Katie\u2019s hand and led her onto the floor. He was grinning, she was smiling, and they danced smoothly, gracefully, like they could read each other\u2019s moves before they happened.</p> <p>\u201cZerbrowski, you can dance,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBallroom dancing lessons were my present to Katie for our thirteenth anniversary. Give me a few years and even I can learn,\u201d he said as he whirled Katie around the floor.</p><p>Nathaniel came to me and held out his hand. What else could I do, I took it, and let him settle me in his arms. I went up on tiptoe since the shoes I was wearing didn\u2019t have the heels of dancing shoes. How did I know how to do ballroom dancing? We\u2019d all learned so that we didn\u2019t disgrace Jean-Claude at the big vampire balls and parties that we sometimes had to do as part of vamp politics. The older and more powerful the vampire, the more they liked spectacle and a show. We\u2019d actually started having a once-a-month dance lesson and ball at Danse Macabre, the dance club that Jean-Claude owned, because he never lost an opportunity to make money off of a necessity. We had to learn the old dances so we could show the other vampires we were civilized. He taught them to humans who wanted to dance with the vampires, politics and capitalism in a nice little package, that was my main vampire sweetie.</p><p>There were actually a few couples that joined us, including Jamie and Kevin Appleton. Greg Zerbrowski went back to his ballerina and offered her his hand. She took it smiling and he led her to the dance floor and showed that his dad had taught him more than just how to throw a curveball.</p><p>Several of the wives dragged their husbands awkwardly to the dance floor, but a number of them refused. Nathaniel kissed me lightly, and handed me over to Micah, who proved that he could dance, too. Nathaniel went to Jean Forbes and asked her husband\u2019s permission to dance with her. Since he\u2019d refused to do it, what could he do but say yes.</p><p>Jean didn\u2019t know how to do this kind of dancing, but Nathaniel was a good partner and led her through the moves while she giggled.</p><p>A lot of the boys went and got dance partners, including Matthew, who was out with Becky Appleton. I wasn\u2019t surprised to see Jeannette Forbes with Cyrus, or that he was a lot less happy trying to do this new dance than Matthew was. It was movement to music and Matthew picked it up better than any of the other younger boys. Some of the little girls were leading their partners through rather than being led, and that was okay, too. Dancing like this was one of the places I was perfectly content to not be in charge.</p><p>Micah moved me effortlessly, our arms forming the framework to hold our bodies in space and time with each other. I\u2019d hated it when we first started learning, but it was actually relaxing now to follow instead of being followed.</p><p>The wives partnered with Nathaniel and Micah, and Zerbrowski and Greg, and even Kevin Appleton. Katie, Jamie Appleton, and I helped some of the husbands out, but mostly they either watched, or drifted away.</p><p>The football player stayed to learn with his dark-haired ballerina. Jean got her husband Mitchell to try. He moved awkwardly, but I couldn\u2019t decide if it was because he couldn\u2019t dance, or couldn\u2019t get out of his way enough to allow it.</p><p>I\u2019d half expected creepy-but-beautiful Elise to try and dance with Nathaniel, but she wasn\u2019t here. I asked Zerbrowski and found out that Clint and Crystal had confronted her about her lie in front of Elise\u2019s husband, and they\u2019d left with a truly spectacular fight starting between them. Apparently, her husband hadn\u2019t known she\u2019d tried to sleep with Nathaniel. Karma: what goes around comes around, and sometimes it bites.</p><p>The rest of us danced. We stayed behind to help the Zerbrowskis clean up after most of the other guests had gone. Zerbrowski did the dishes, whistling to himself as he did it. Like he\u2019d said, seeing Kaitlin that happy had been totally worth it. Matthew fell asleep in the middle of the floor as if his batteries had given out all at once. I thought picking him up would wake him, but he was so deeply asleep that he never stirred as Nathaniel picked him up to carry to the car.</p><p>Katie and Zerbrowski both hugged me bye. Kaitlin and Greg were already in their rooms asleep. Katie hugged both my men good-bye, and Zerbrowski shook Micah\u2019s hand and patted Nathaniel on the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou made our daughter\u2019s month,\u201d he said.</p><p>Nathaniel smiled. \u201cIt was a pleasure, she\u2019s a good dancer, and she was really good helping teach the younger kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wants to have her own ballet school someday\u2014after she\u2019s been a prima ballerina, of course,\u201d Katie said.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Nathaniel said, smiling.</p><p>We walked out into the humid summer evening, night insects filling the darkness with a high humming buzz. It took two of us to get Matthew fastened into his safety seat, because he was so asleep that he kept trying to slide out, but we got him buckled in and then Micah asked to drive home. He almost never asked to drive, so I gave him the keys. If he\u2019d been one of those men who always insisted on driving I would have fought him, but Micah didn\u2019t try and control, so I didn\u2019t have to fight to keep control. Life is like dancing, sometimes one of you leads, sometimes the other, and if you do it right it\u2019s beautiful, even when it\u2019s hard. </p> </body></html>"]
