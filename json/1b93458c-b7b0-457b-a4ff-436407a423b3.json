It was the street of her childhood, yet somehow it was different. The houses weren\u2019t quite the same and something didn\u2019t...well, it didn\u2019t quite feel right.</p><p>She glanced up at the boy whose hand she held. Her mind was keenly aware that she didn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d him, but her heart told her otherwise. His hair was short and the light brown color reminded her of the sand after it had been washed over by a wave. Her eyes followed the shape of his body through the shirt he wore. She could see the muscles in his arms, and his broad shoulders were hard to hide. His face appeared flawless and it took every ounce of willpower she possessed not to run her hand down his cheek just to feel the softness of his skin.</p><p>Then there were his eyes. They sparkled with such blue radiance that every time she looked at them, she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever be able to look away. It was as though he could see right through her. She thought she should be uncomfortable with all of this, but for some reason, she was completely at ease with this stranger. He looked at her and smiled. His perfect teeth and full lips made him even more gorgeous.</p> <p>They walked and he talked a lot. He told her things that didn\u2019t make any sense to her. He spoke about where he grew up and how his house wasn\u2019t there any more. He talked about a fire, horses, and mentioned something about a soldier and war. Katherine listened intently to all the information, but her brain didn\u2019t fully process it. She didn\u2019t know what was going on, really.</p><p>She tried to take in the details he shared and make sense of it but logic was pushed out of the way. She was too caught up in how she felt. The pure love that consumed her every time she looked at this boy was unlike anything she\u2019d ever known before. If soul mates existed and there was such a thing, this stranger was all the proof she needed. It was as if nothing else existed or mattered in the world around them.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t aware of the noise at first; she was so caught up in the blue of his eyes. Then she heard it more clearly; the sound of quiet screams started to ring in her ears. Or maybe it was more like muffled wailing. She wasn\u2019t sure. But at that moment she felt her stomach drop to the ground beneath her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back. I have to go in there.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips against her hand and then slowly started to untangle his from hers. \u201cNo. Please don\u2019t go.\u201d She pleaded with him to stay and gripped his fingers as tightly as she could.</p> <p>\u201cKatherine, I have to help.\u201d He smiled at her, his blue eyes sparkling, and then repeated, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d she asked him nervously.</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d he repeated reassuringly. She watched him slowly disappear through the front door.</p><p>Grief immediately washed over her. She fell to her knees and clutched at her queasy stomach. She felt a sickness she couldn\u2019t define. She knew with unfailing certainty that he would never walk back out of that house. The pain and loss was so severe she thought it might stop her breathing completely. And then she heard it.</p><p>A single gunshot.</p><p>\u201cKatherine? Katherine, are you okay? Wake up.\u201d A familiar voice startled her awake.</p> <p>Katherine\u2019s eyes shot open to see her roommate Taylor standing above her. She focused on the blue eyes staring back at her. They had only been roommates a few weeks now, but they had bonded instantly. Katherine felt like she had known Taylor her whole life.</p><p>\u201cMy God, Katherine, are you all right? You\u2019re crying so hard. I mean, you\u2019re like really crying. What the hell were you dreaming about?\u201d Taylor looked at her with concern.</p><p>\u201cDreaming?\u201d Katherine repeated softly. \u201cI was dreaming? He was a dream?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe, who? Tell me everything!\u201d Taylor\u2019s demeanor changed from concern to girlish squeals as her blonde hair bounced along her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...talk about it right now, Tay,\u201d Katherine could barely get the words out. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to move. It felt so real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreams always feel real when you\u2019re in them,\u201d Taylor reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI know, but this was different.\u201d Katherine struggled to put her feelings into words. \u201cEverything was so intense...and the guy. I\u2019ve just never felt like that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWHAT guy? Come on, Kat, you have to tell me! I mean, you were crying! Like real tears! And you\u2019re all weird right now,\u201d Taylor begged.</p> <p>\u201cTaylor, I know this sounds stupid, but right now I\u2019m still processing the fact that everything I just felt and experienced was a dream. It wasn\u2019t real. I can\u2019t believe he wasn\u2019t real.\u201d She wiped at her eyes.</p><p>\u201cCrying again? Really? What the hell, Kat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything, I promise. I just need a minute. Please?\u201d Katherine pleaded.</p><p>Taylor pouted and walked away.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s crazy Taylor. It\u2019s just the minute I move, everything\u2019s going to fade. It\u2019s all going to disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Taylor asked, her eyes narrowed with confusion.</p><p>Katherine took a deep breath, \u201cIt\u2019s like I can feel him around me. Like my dream is lingering in the air. And I know once I move, it\u2019s going to leave. I just want to hold onto to it for a bit longer. Does that make any sense?\u201d Katherine\u2019s face crinkled as she tried to explain.</p><p>\u201cNot really. But I\u2019ll give you some space.\u201d Taylor walked toward the bathroom and shut the door behind her.</p><p>Katherine briefly thought about going back to sleep, but she resisted the urge. She forced her body out from under her covers. With every move, she could feel the dream and her memory of him fading. She knew it was inevitable, but it hurt. And that confused her.</p><p>\u201cTaylor?\u201d she yelled out toward the bathroom.</p><p>She heard the door open and Taylor\u2019s head popped out. \u201cOh, so you\u2019ve decided to join the living today, eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she replied solemnly. \u201cI want to tell you everything. This guy\u2014this dream\u2014it was crazy. I don\u2019t even know how to start talking about it because it was more of a feeling than anything else.\u201d Katherine sighed before she continued.</p><p>\u201cEven saying that out loud sounds stupid, I know, but it\u2019s true. I mean, not much happened in the dream, aside from him getting shot and killed, which was totally awesome,\u201d she added sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Who got shot and killed? I\u2019m confused,\u201d Taylor looked at her and shook her head. \u201cYou have to start from the beginning. And you have to hurry because we have class in half an hour!\u201d She glanced up at the clock on the wall.</p><p>Katherine filled Taylor in on every detail she could remember. The house. The fire. The gunshot. The soldier and the war. She did her best to put her feelings into words, although she knew no words could ever do her feelings justice. She described the guy, what he looked like, what it felt like to be around him, what it felt like when he left her and how she felt when she heard the gunshot. Taylor wrote it all down; every single word.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Katherine asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cTaking notes for later,\u201d Taylor explained.</p><p>Katherine thought Taylor looked like a detective with her pad of paper and pen sitting on the chair with her legs crossed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, later? You\u2019re so weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You have some dream that makes you cry and I\u2019m the weird one?\u201d Taylor teased.</p><p>\u201cNo really, what do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Taylor paused, \u201cLet\u2019s just say for the sake of exploring all our options, your dream guy is real? We need to write down what he looks like and stuff so we can find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal?\u201d The idea of him existing hadn\u2019t even occurred to Katherine.</p><p>Taylor\u2019s voice rose. \u201cYeah! I mean, what if? What if he came to you in your dream and you\u2019re going to find him in class or something? What if he goes to our school? You never know. Why else would you dream about this guy and have all these crazy feelings if he wasn\u2019t real?\u201d</p><p>Taylor\u2019s question sparked curiosity and hope in Katherine. Her face relaxed and her eyes brightened. \u201cMaybe he is real? Can you imagine?\u201d Katherine smiled for the first time that morning, \u201cI mean, why else would I have had that dream? There has to be a reason, right? There has to be a point to all of this madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying!\u201d Taylor responded excitedly.</p><p>\u201cI should probably do something with myself before we leave for class. I mean, what if my dream guy is there?\u201d She hopped up and headed toward the bathroom smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou can start by brushing that hair of yours!\u201d Taylor sarcastically shouted toward her.</p><p>\u201cWhat would I ever do without you?\u201d Katherine piped back.</p><p>\u201cClearly, you\u2019d walk around with nappy hair all day.\u201d</p><p>Katherine brushed her long brown hair as Taylor had instructed her to. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want to disappoint,\u201d she mumbled at her reflection. She coated her eyelashes with dark mascara to accent her bright hazel eyes and tried to cover up the light dusting of freckles across her nose with some powder foundation.</p><p>\u201cHe could totally be real,\u201d she repeated in her head until she said it out loud by accident.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I keep telling you. He has to be. Oh, Kat, this is so exciting! We have a mission.\u201d Taylor beamed. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad you didn\u2019t get his name or something. Because I could search online for him if you had a name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Tay, he was too busy getting killed to tell me his name. But if I see him again, I\u2019ll ask.\u201d Katherine felt her personality slowly coming back.</p><p>The two girls headed out of the old brick dormitory and walked through campus toward class. Katherine looked around at the stone buildings that surrounded her and smiled. She thought about her home and how no buildings looked the way these ones did. She loved Southern California, but wanted to experience something different for college.</p><p>She could have stayed there, but she knew it would just be more of the same\u2014 gorgeous people consumed by celebrity, fame, reality TV, and their future careers. She wanted to meet new people and wondered: what could be more different from the constant sunny days of Los Angeles than the snowy East Coast?</p><p>She remembered how she felt when the information packet arrived from a school in New Jersey she had only vaguely considered at first. But something about this particular college called to her. She wasn\u2019t sure if it was the old ivy covered buildings, or the tree lined campus, but she knew immediately that she wanted to be there. So when her acceptance letter arrived in the mail, she was thrilled.</p><p>Taylor\u2019s voice interrupted her memories, \u201cIs that him? What about that guy?\u201d Taylor pointed out guys who fit the description of Dream Guy. \u201cOh, what about him? If he\u2019s not your Dream Guy, I\u2019ll take him to be mine. Hotness on a stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make me crazy. How about if I see him, I\u2019ll let you know? And really, hotness on a stick? Who are you?\u201d Katherine cracked up.</p><p>\u201cWe could put an ad up on the school\u2019s website? Or in the paper? We can totally do this.\u201d Taylor\u2019s eyes twinkled in excitement. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow about we just go to class first? For all we know, he could be dead. He did die in my dream after all.\u201d The back of Katherine\u2019s mind nagged at her. The thought of him being dead wasn\u2019t something she wanted to accept, so she forced those thoughts aside.</p><p>They walked into the large classroom and Taylor motioned toward the last row. \u201cCan we sit in the back? I hate having people sit behind me. It\u2019s like I can feel them staring down the back of my neck,\u201d Taylor shivered.</p><p>\u201cWherever\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t care.\u201d Katherine followed Taylor\u2019s lead.</p><p>Katherine sat down and noticed Taylor scanning the room. She watched as Taylor quickly jotted things down in her notepad. The sight made her laugh out loud.</p> <p>The guy in front of her turned around when he heard her laugh. Katherine struggled to breathe as she fixated on the green eyes in front of her. They continued to stare at each another and Katherine felt herself flush. She knew one of them had to turn away, but he was the one turned backward, not her. He finally faced the front of the classroom and Taylor kicked Katherine under the table.</p><p>\u201cWhat...was...that?\u201d Taylor whispered toward her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but he\u2019s really cute isn\u2019t he? Did you see his eyes? Good Lord.\u201d Katherine\u2019s cheeks burned.</p><p>\u201cBlue?\u201d Taylor asked with a big smile.</p><p>\u201cNo, green. But still...hello! Is it hot in here?\u201d Kat laughed and fanned her face.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just you. And apparently him,\u201d Taylor joked back.</p><p>\u201cLadies, is there a problem?\u201d The professor stopped his lecture and looked at the girls in the back of the room.</p><p>\u201cNo, Professor. Sorry!\u201d they responded in unison.</p><p>Katherine punched Taylor under the table. The green-eyed boy looked back for one more glance, a quick smile and then turned back around. Katherine\u2019s breath hitched.</p><p>When class ended, Katherine gathered up her things and scanned the room. \u201cWell that\u2019s weird. I mean, where\u2019d he go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly, you scared him so he had to run away,\u201d Taylor joked.</p> <p>She shrugged her shoulders and pulled Taylor toward the door. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>They walked outside and into the blinding sunlight. Katherine squinted and quickly reached for her sunglasses. She looked around at the huge green trees and walked toward an unoccupied stone bench.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s sit for a minute,\u201d Katherine suggested.</p><p>\u201cOk. I want to ask you some more questions anyway,\u201d Taylor added.</p><p>Katherine laughed, \u201cWhat more can you possibly want to know?\u201d</p><p>Taylor pulled out her notepad. \u201cWhy were you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t explain it. It\u2019s the very thought of him. That moment when I heard the gunshot...\u201d Katherine paused and pressed her hand against her heart. \u201cIt physically brought me pain. It\u2019s like I went to bed with a whole heart, but I woke up with it in pieces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat, that\u2019s really intense. We\u2019re way too young and way too hot to be this crazy over some guy we\u2019ve never met before.\u201d Taylor informed her with a serious look on her face.</p> <p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we. I mean, I\u2019m totally involved in this now too, so...WE.\u201d Taylor folder her arms across her chest.</p><p>Katherine stood up from the bench and smiled, \u201cYou\u2019re crazy. I\u2019ve got to go to my next class. Chemistry. Awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you at home. Did I tell you that Kylie is stopping by to see our place and say hi and stuff?\u201d Taylor reminded her.</p><p>\u201cWho is she again?\u201d Katherine asked.</p><p>\u201cOne of my best friends from high school. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll love her. I think,\u201d Taylor laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat???\u201d Katherine\u2019s eyes widened with worry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make sure she\u2019s on her best behavior,\u201d Taylor reassured her confidently.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, seriously? Why? What\u2019s her deal?\u201d Katherine pressed.</p><p>\u201cShe just...I don\u2019t know. She can be a real bitch sometimes. She\u2019s competitive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s your best friend? How did that happen?\u201d Katherine sincerely wondered.</p><p>\u201cEh, it\u2019s a long story,\u201d Taylor hesitated before quickly saying, \u201cI hated her at first, something bad happened that brought us together, and here we are.\u201d</p><p>Confused, Katherine shook her head and threw up her arms, \u201cOkay. Whatever. See you at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not mad, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re just weird,\u201d Katherine smiled and turned to head toward her class.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the weird one. See ya later weirdo!\u201d Taylor shouted as she headed in the opposite direction.</p><p>Taylor walked into her dorm room and tossed everything onto the floor except her notebook. She read over her scribbles from Katherine\u2019s dream and added new thoughts and questions. When the house phone finally rang, she jumped.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. This is the front desk. Your guest has arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you send her up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to come down and sign her in first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>Taylor hopped up and ran out the door. She rounded the corner and saw Kylie waiting impatiently for her.</p><p>\u201cSo this is what you\u2019ve ditched me for, huh?\u201d Kylie asked snidely.</p><p>Taylor signed the guest sheet and gave Kylie a tight squeeze. \u201cDon\u2019t be a brat. Come on. I\u2019m so excited you\u2019re here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, tell me about your roommate? Do we hate her?\u201d Kylie asked with a smile.</p><p>Taylor laughed, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t hate her. We love her.\u201d</p><p>Kylie scrunched her nose and Taylor snapped, \u201cOh, I know that look. Don\u2019t be a bitch, Kylie. She\u2019s from California and she\u2019s really great. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. I\u2019ll try to be nice,\u201d Kylie sassed.</p><p>\u201cHow lucky for us all,\u201d Taylor teased.</p><p>Katherine walked through the door and the conversation abruptly stopped. Her eyes quickly met Kylie\u2019s and she watched as the stunning blonde sized her up with a scowl. Kat smiled in return.</p><p>Taylor jumped up, \u201cHey, Kat! This is my best friend from home, Kylie. Kylie, this is my roommate Katherine.\u201d Taylor held her breath.</p><p>Kylie stood up and reached for Katherine\u2019s hand. \u201cSo you\u2019re the famous roommate my best friend loves so much.\u201d</p><p>Katherine shot Taylor a look, \u201cUh...I guess so? It\u2019s nice to meet you, Kylie. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d</p><p>Chills sped down Katherine\u2019s spine as the tension between her and Kylie filled the room. Katherine sensed something undeniably off between the two of them and she wondered if Kylie did as well.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you staying? Do you want to come out with us tonight?\u201d Katherine asked in an overly friendly tone. The last thing she wanted was an enemy.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t though about it, but what are you guys doing? I mean, if it\u2019s some sort of party with really hot guys, you\u2019ll need me there,\u201d Kylie said as she ran her fingers through her short blonde hair.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, Princess Kylie, for we humble servants cannot meet any guys without your presence. Please accompany us to the party we\u2019re crashing later,\u201d Taylor quipped back, rolling her eyes.</p><p>Kylie eyeballed Katherine before looking back at Taylor, \u201cI\u2019m just saying you probably need me is all. You know that no guy can resist this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you...in private?\u201d Taylor barked and quickly grabbed Kylie by the arm.</p><p>Katherine watched as Taylor pulled Kylie roughly into the bathroom. She cringed slightly as Taylor slammed the door shut.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is wrong with you?\u201d Taylor whispered harshly.</p><p>\u201cNothing. What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Kylie snapped back in response.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you being a bitch?\u201d</p><p>Kylie narrowed her eyes and glared, \u201cI don\u2019t trust her.\u201d</p><p>Taylor laughed, \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t trust her?\u201d</p><p>Kylie shrugged her shoulders, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Call it woman\u2019s intuition or whatever. There\u2019s just something about her I don\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Kylie? If this is how you\u2019re going to be then you should just leave.\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s face dropped, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll try to behave. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Taylor huffed out a long sigh, \u201cDo better than try.\u201d</p><p>The bathroom door opened slowly and Taylor walked out first. She mouthed I\u2019m sorry in Katherine\u2019s direction and Katherine simply smiled.</p><p>Kylie emerged and said unemotionally, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for being mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Katherine longed for peace. \u201cSo, are you going to come with us tonight or what?</p><p>Kylie pondered the offer, \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll stay the night?\u201d Taylor pushed.</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not driving home at like 3 in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Taylor smiled.</p><p>\u201cBut one of you better let me borrow some clothes because I didn\u2019t bring anything to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can look through my stuff if you want,\u201d Katherine offered.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Kylie responded and headed toward the closet.</p><p>Taylor breathed a sigh of relief, \u201cPlus, Kylie, you can help us look for Kat\u2019s dream guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Taylor? I forgot all about him,\u201d Katherine answered calmly.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Katherine shot Taylor a look. \u201cIt\u2019s totally normal that I can\u2019t stop thinking about him, right? I\u2019m sure I\u2019m perfectly sane,\u201d Katherine rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat dream guy?\u201d Kylie inquired, half excited, half annoyed.</p><p>\u201cCan I tell her?\u201d Taylor looked at Katherine for approval.</p><p>Katherine nodded and pretended not to listen as Taylor filled Kylie in.</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s pretty crazy. And you have no idea who he is?\u201d Kylie looked at Katherine with disbelief.</p><p>Katherine shook her head, \u201cNever seen him before in my life.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>\u201cSo what frat is this again?\u201d Katherine asked sweetly.</p><p>\u201cKat, I\u2019ve told you a hundred times how much calling a fraternity a frat makes them cry like little girls. Try not to do that to any of them tonight, will ya? It\u2019s embarrassing...you know, for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try my best, but no promises,\u201d Katherine smiled.</p><p>\u201cAnd in all honesty, I\u2019m not sure what fraternity this is. Does it really matter when there are hockey players involved?\u201d Taylor asked with excitement.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d sighed Kylie. \u201cYou\u2019re joking right? Are we going to a hockey party or a fraternity party? I really need to know how much of my A-game I need to bring, Tay. You have to give a girl like me some warning!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why am I so confused right now?\u201d laughed Kat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t listen to Kylie. She\u2019s all hot and bothered about the hockey players. She knows that fraternity guys are easy but the hockey players require a bit more is all,\u201d Taylor informed her.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You guys are making me crazy right now. What are you talking about? A bit more what?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA bit more EVERYTHING, Kat! Jeez, don\u2019t you know anything about hockey players?\u201d Kylie growled.</p><p>\u201cNot really. I don\u2019t think I even know anyone who plays hockey. But if you want to talk baseball players, I\u2019m your girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaseball? Ugh. Could a sport be more boring?\u201d Kylie grumbled and then looked toward Taylor for approval.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it could be golf.\u201d Taylor piped back and shot her a look to behave. \u201cI\u2019m a hockey girl. Always have been. Don\u2019t know what it is about those boys that get me all hot and bothered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do,\u201d Kylie laughed and then gave her a shove. \u201cTaylor\u2019s only dated hockey players.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly? Every one of them?\u201d Katherine asked through a laugh.</p><p>Taylor shrugged, \u201cWhat can I say? I like hockey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it. Like, at all,\u201d Katherine admitted.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d</p> <p>They rounded the corner and Katherine smiled to herself when she heard the chaos of music and voices mixed together. She noticed a crowd of people drinking out of red plastic cups in the front yard and a long line at the front door.</p><p>\u201cI do not wait in lines,\u201d Kylie announced and headed straight for the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she doing?\u201d Katherine asked nervously.</p><p>\u201cGetting us in. Watch,\u201d Taylor laughed.</p><p>After whispering something seductively into the guy at the door\u2019s ear, Kylie waved them over. Katherine put her hand out for a stamp and rushed inside the house. Taylor pulled Katherine through the crowds.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Kat. Keep up,\u201d Taylor yelled over the music to her.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to get a beer and then we\u2019re going outside where we can scope out the situation and make our move,\u201d Kylie responded.</p><p>Katherine cracked up at the words \u201cmake our move\u201d and suddenly found herself locked onto a very familiar pair of green eyes. His eyes alone stopped her in her tracks. Without even a thought, her lips formed a smile.</p><p>He smiled back and she felt herself blush. She tried to force her eyes away from his, but it was useless. They wouldn\u2019t cooperate with her brain.</p><p>She felt a rough tug at her arm. \u201cWhat are you doing, Kat? Come on!\u201d Taylor yelled. But then she saw where Kat looked, \u201cOh, the green-eyed hottie from class. Go get him!\u201d Taylor tried to quickly walk away.</p><p>\u201cNo, Taylor! Don\u2019t leave me.\u201d She refused to let go of Taylor\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem? He\u2019s gorgeous! Go talk to him!\u201d Taylor gave Kat a little shove in the guy\u2019s direction.</p><p>Kat shot Taylor a look that said she\u2019d kill her later, but it was too late. He was right in front of her now. She hadn\u2019t realized in class how good looking he was. He was built like someone chiseled him out of stone. His body screamed athlete. His arms were incredible. She wanted to reach out and squeeze them just to feel his muscles, but she resisted the urge. Plus, she thought it would be weird to grope a stranger.</p> <p>She could tell he was well over six feet tall because even in her three-inch wedges, he towered over her. He wore a baseball cap that covered his short, dark brown hair, low across his forehead. In Kat\u2019s opinion the hat was way too low, but for whatever reason, it looked good on him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cooper Donovan,\u201d he said, stretching out his hand.</p><p>\u201cCooper? Cool name. I\u2019m Kat...or Katherine,\u201d she fumbled and tried to hide her nerves.</p><p>\u201cKatherine. Nice to meet you. Sorry about the thing in class,\u201d he mentioned.</p><p>\u201cClass?\u201d She struggled to remember and then shook her head, \u201cOh. It\u2019s okay. I mean you didn\u2019t do anything except turn around and stare at me and my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be fair, I was just staring at you,\u201d he informed her with a smirk.</p><p>Her legs started to shake. She wondered why he made her so nervous. She was around attractive guys all the time in Southern California, why was this one throwing her all out of whack? His voice interrupted her self questioning.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you from anyway? I mean, no offense, it\u2019s just that you don\u2019t seem like you\u2019re from around here.\u201d</p><p>She found herself mesmerized by the curves of his mouth. \u201cCalifornia. What gave it away?\u201d she questioned.</p><p>\u201cThe accent, first of all,\u201d he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI do not have an accent. You guys have the accent, not me!\u201d She tried so hard to act normal, but he threw her off balance. Her eyes lingered on his lips and she wondered what it would be like to kiss them.</p><p>Kylie and Taylor watched the interaction from the other room. \u201cHe looks like a nice guy,\u201d Taylor said out loud.</p><p>\u201cA nice, hot as hell, guy,\u201d Kylie answered. \u201cEnough with watching this romance blossom. What about us, Tay? Who will be my victim tonight?\u201d Kylie looked around with intent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure anyone you choose would be more than happy to oblige.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say no to this body?\u201d Kylie waved her hands up and down.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to be blind,\u201d Taylor agreed before glancing back at Katherine.</p><p>\u201cSo, California, how do you like living out here?\u201d Cooper asked with genuine interest.</p><p>Before she could answer, a vivacious brunette bounced in between them and wrapped her arms around Cooper. \u201cHi, Cooper. What do you say we ditch this party and go somewhere else?\u201d</p><p>Cooper unwrapped the girls arms from around his neck and placed them firmly back at her side before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s not. I\u2019m in the middle of a conversation and you\u2019re being very rude.\u201d</p><p>The girl glared at Katherine before huffing out some comment and storming off. \u201cHappen to you often?\u201d she wondered.</p><p>\u201cSort of,\u201d his jaw unclenched, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I hate it when girls act like that.\u201d He took a breath to regain his composure. \u201cAnyway, back to the question. How do you like it out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it so far. I mean, it\u2019s not winter yet, so I\u2019ll probably cry when it snows, but so far, it\u2019s been amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you cry when it snows,\u201d he told her with a smile.</p><p>\u201cOh, is that so?\u201d</p><p>She could feel the connection between them. It wasn\u2019t as intense as what she felt for the guy from her dream, but there was something unexplainable between her and Cooper Donovan. There was a quiet spark of recognition that burned inside her. It was as if she already knew him on some level, but that didn\u2019t make any sense to her.</p><p>\u201cYep. I\u2019ll have you loving the snow by the time it\u2019s gone,\u201d he informed her.</p><p>His confidence was a turn-on. It made her wonder if he ever questioned or wasn\u2019t sure of anything in his life. \u201cSo, what about you?\u201d Katherine asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me, what? Do I enjoy going to college a mere three hours away from my parents\u2019 house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice, actually. It\u2019s far enough away that they can\u2019t just pop over unannounced, but it\u2019s close enough that they can come to my games if they want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGames?\u201d she asked hesitantly, but assumed what came next.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the hockey team,\u201d he said with such pride that she couldn\u2019t help but feel proud of him herself.</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d she laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with hockey?\u201d he shot back.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I don\u2019t know anything about the sport. But my roommate Taylor is completely obsessed with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, maybe I should be talking to her then,\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cSure, if you\u2019re into perfectly gorgeous girls with amazing personalities, then go for it. I understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny, California.\u201d</p><p>Katherine smiled at him before glancing around the crowded party. \u201cI\u2019d better go find my friends.\u201d She couldn\u2019t see Taylor and Kylie any more and that made her uneasy.</p><p>\u201cI think your roommate\u2014Taylor, right? She\u2019s with my buddy Danny. They\u2019re talking in the corner outside over there.\u201d He pointed in their direction. \u201cDo you see them?\u201d</p><p>Katherine spotted Taylor with a tall, muscular boy with really dark hair. The guy towered over Taylor\u2019s 5-foot-4-inch frame. She happened to glance up as Kat looked in her direction and gave a wave that let her know all was well.</p><p>\u201cHockey player?\u201d Katherine asked.</p><p>\u201cYep. He\u2019s damn good too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Taylor will be pleased.\u201d Cooper smiled and she realized how perfect his teeth were. \u201cI thought hockey players were supposed to have messed up teeth or something? Don\u2019t you get hit in the face a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t get out of the way. But I actually like my face, so I don\u2019t want it all smashed up. Because then pretty girls like you wouldn\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s heart raced against her ribcage. He thought she was pretty? She understood cute, but pretty? She was so busy talking herself out of the compliment that she almost forgot to thank him. \u201cUh, thanks,\u201d she fumbled, \u201cfor...saying I was pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. Thank your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, really?\u201d she laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s not my fault that you can\u2019t see what I see.\u201d His eyes softened as he looked into hers.</p><p>Katherine\u2019s pulse raced. \u201cDo you see Kylie anywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour other friend, right? The other blonde? I\u2019m sure she\u2019s here somewhere. She looked like she was on a mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d feel better if I just knew where she was. Do you mind?\u201d Katherine turned to walk away.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. But I\u2019m coming with you.\u201d He hurried beside her.</p><p>They walked together searching for Kylie. It was the first time that Katherine wasn\u2019t completely consumed by thoughts of her dream guy. Although she wasn\u2019t sure why, being around Cooper made her feel completely safe.</p><p>They finally found Kylie making out with some guy and Katherine breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cYou worry a lot, don\u2019t you?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make fun. I\u2019m not a worrywart or anything. I just like to know that the people I came to a strange party with are safe and not missing or anything. Don\u2019t be a jerk.\u201d She hit him in the arm playfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. It\u2019s sweet. And smart. So I\u2019ll just remember that you\u2019re the smart one when it comes to your friends.\u201d</p><p>They shared a glance and she sighed, \u201cYour eyes are gorgeous. I love the little speckle thing you have in this eye.\u201d</p><p>She touched the side of his face and flinched as electricity jolted through her entire body. Her pulse raced and she got entirely too sweaty for a girl. All she could think about was how nervous he made her and how it felt like her heart was trying to escape.</p><p>\u201cWhich eye is it? This one?\u201d He pressed her hand tightly against his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d was about all she could muster. She found herself memorizing his eyes. She took in the exact color of green...and how they changed to almost yellow at the pupil. She thought it looked like a sunflower but didn\u2019t want to tell a guy he had sunflowers in his eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you two doing?\u201d Danny bounced up with Taylor close behind.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, you two. Get a room. That\u2019s embarrassing!\u201d Taylor teased.</p><p>\u201cShut up. I was just looking at the speck in his eye. And...ah, never mind,\u201d Katherine stopped trying to explain.</p><p>\u201cKat, this is Danny. Danny, this is my roommate, Kat.\u201d She turned to Cooper and said, \u201cI\u2019m Taylor. What\u2019s your name, eye speck?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCute. Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool name! Hockey?\u201d Taylor spoke quickly, but he kept up.</p><p>\u201cYep. But I\u2019m way better than your boy, Danny, here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, Coop,\u201d Danny whined.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s be clear...he\u2019s NOT my boy,\u201d Taylor snapped and shot Danny a glance.</p> <p>\u201cYET!\u201d Danny shouted at her.</p><p>\u201cDream on, kid,\u201d Taylor teased, \u201cWhere\u2019s Kylie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time we saw her she was upstairs kissing some guy. I assume she\u2019s still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should get her and head home. This party is about to get broken up anyway. It\u2019s out of control and way too loud.\u201d Taylor grabbed Katherine\u2019s hand and pulled her up the stairs, while Cooper and Danny watched them go, smiles plastered on both their faces.</p><p>Katherine wasn\u2019t sure how Taylor knew when a party was and wasn\u2019t out of control, but it turned out she was right. As they dragged Kylie away from her boyfriend for the night, campus police rounded the corner.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just going to leave without saying goodbye?\u201d Cooper shouted toward her.</p> <p>Katherine noticed everyone staring at her, so she refused to respond. Her eyes darted from Cooper to the crowd of gawkers and then back to him again. Cooper looked around and quickly jogged to her side.</p><p>He slid his arm around her waist and she felt her throat catch. \u201cAt least let me walk you home?\u201d He practically begged, but Katherine couldn\u2019t take any more heart-pounding or throat catching.</p><p>She wiggled her body free from his hand and relished the air she could once again breathe. \u201cI think we\u2019re fine. Right?\u201d She looked at the girls who shook their heads in unison. \u201cSee, we\u2019re fine. I\u2019ll see you in class, Coopertown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye, Danny-boy,\u201d Taylor shouted back at him as she walked away.</p><p>That night before Katherine fell asleep; she wondered if she would see her dream guy again. She wasn\u2019t quite sure why, after the night she\u2019d just had with Cooper, she was even thinking about him at all. She wondered if she associated him with sleep, but knew instinctively it was more than that.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you sighing about?\u201d Taylor asked her through a yawn.</p><p>Katherine looked down from her bed and noticed that Kylie was already fast asleep. \u201cJust wondering if my dream guy will make another appearance tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready leaving Cooper in the dust for some guy you don\u2019t even know? You\u2019re one serious heartbreaker, Katherine Johns. But not for nothing, if you do dream about this boy again\u2014that would be pretty awesome!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know! Not very realistic though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares about reality, Kat? Geez, you\u2019re such a downer.\u201d</p><p>Katherine snickered, \u201cGoodnight, Taylor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, downer-face!\u201d</p><p>Katherine lay her head on her pillow and promptly fell asleep. She awoke the next morning to the sound of Kylie rushing out of the dorm room.</p><p>\u201cBye, girls! Had a blast! See you soon!\u201d Kylie yelled and then slammed the door.</p><p>\u201cSo? Did we have any appearances last night?\u201d Taylor asked, as she walked out of the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cYeah, your dad,\u201d Katherine replied sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re hilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Katherine quipped. \u201cBut seriously, no dreams at all last night,\u201d she added with a hint of disappointment.</p><p>Taylor crooked her head, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Are you sad?\u201d</p><p>Katherine nodded, \u201cI know it probably sounds dumb, but yeah. A little. I just thought...I don\u2019t know what I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019d see him again?\u201d Taylor asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. At least I hoped,\u201d Katherine admitted.</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s always Cooper. You think he knows he\u2019s playing backup to a dream guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaylor. Be real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Cooper is totally number two in this relationship and Dream Guy is clearly number one. Just saying you should give the poor guy some warning before he goes falling head over heels for you.\u201d</p><p>The very thought of it all made Katherine dizzy. Did she want a relationship with Cooper? She barely knew him. Was she willing to give up on Dream Guy because that\u2019s what sane people would do? You can\u2019t hold on the idea of some random guy from a dream your whole life. But then she reminded herself that that was no ordinary dream. Feelings and emotions that intense don\u2019t just happen all the time. It all had to mean something.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Taylor waved her hand in front of Kat\u2019s face, \u201cI just meant that he clearly likes you and if...\u201d</p><p>Katherine cut her off mid-sentence, \u201cI get it, Tay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hey, don\u2019t get mad. I\u2019m just playing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that this is all too weird for me. And everything about both guys is really intense, really fast, and it\u2019s just all kind of crazy, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn all honesty, yeah. I mean it is crazy. And it is fast. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a bad thing. Are you even interested in Cooper? I mean, is he your type?\u201d</p><p>Katherine remained silent while she stared at Taylor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m only asking because I don\u2019t really know what your type is?\u201d Taylor quipped.</p><p>\u201cNo, I know. I was just thinking,\u201d Katherine responded.</p><p>\u201cOh, well continue thinking then,\u201d Taylor smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m definitely attracted to him. And I don\u2019t really know him that well, but from what I do know, I love that he\u2019s an athlete because it means he has to do well in school and that he has some sort of work ethic, sense of responsibility and drive,\u201d Katherine paused before continuing.</p><p>\u201cI really respect people who have passion for things. He seems really nice and funny. I mean, yeah...he definitely doesn\u2019t lack any qualities that I like in a guy. But he also kind of scares me,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Scares you how?\u201d Taylor wondered.</p><p>\u201cHe makes me super nervous whenever I see him...and he makes me all sorts of sweaty just when he\u2019s around me. No guy has ever had that kind of effect on me before.\u201d</p><p>Taylor laughed, \u201cDummy. That just means you\u2019re attracted to him. Think you\u2019re the only one who sweats when a hot guy gets close? It\u2019s called chemistry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, we\u2019ve got it in buckets \u2019cause let me tell you...\u201d Katherine started to laugh. \u201cThanks for making me feel less stupid about sweating around a hot guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please! That\u2019s what happens. It\u2019s normal. I mean, normal if you\u2019re attracted to him. And really, how could you not be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is ridiculously good looking, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. So what\u2019s stopping you from giving him a chance? I mean, he sounds perfect,\u201d Taylor asked sincerely.</p><p>\u201cIn all honesty? I sorta can\u2019t get past the guy from my dream. It\u2019s hard to let go of those feelings once you\u2019ve experienced them.\u201d She took a deep breath, \u201cI feel like if I give Cooper a shot, then I\u2019m giving up on my dream guy. And I\u2019m just not ready to do that yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d Taylor agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019m being stupid?\u201d Katherine looked up at her with eyes that said it all. She wanted\u2014no, needed\u2014Taylor to be on her side with this.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I saw you that morning. And I hear the way you talk about him. I wouldn\u2019t give up on him either if it were me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Katherine asked.</p><p>\u201cReally. I\u2019ve never felt anything like what you described. Besides, he could still be real you know?\u201d</p><p>A smile spread across Katherine\u2019s face, \u201cYou make me want to believe in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you never know! Who am I to say what is or isn\u2019t real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what about you? And Danny?\u201d Katherine inquired.</p><p>Taylor\u2019s face instantly turned rosy. \u201cOh yeah, he\u2019s right up my alley. He\u2019s adorable, funny and a total wiseass. I love that he can dish it out and take it. Most guys can only do the dishing, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally. So you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably give him a shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, Taylor, trying to date you is like trying to win the lottery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to understand the way most guys are out here. They are raised to hide their true selves under a ridiculously manly ego and crazy confidence. It is super annoying. They put on tough guy shows twenty-four hours a day. A girl gets tired of dealing with that all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would get annoying. I\u2019d be like, be real already!\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly! But I can see right through Danny. He\u2019s a big softy and he\u2019s not very good at hiding it.\u201d</p><p>Katherine raised her eyebrows, \u201cPoor guy has no idea what he\u2019s in for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Isn\u2019t it great?\u201d Taylor beamed.</p><p>\u201cYou crack me up. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go eat our weight in frozen yogurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds so good. And totally normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell we already know you\u2019re not normal, so why not?\u201d Taylor teased.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Days turned into weeks and Katherine\u2019s dream guy still hadn\u2019t reappeared. The details of the dream may have gotten fuzzy with time but her feelings were something she could never erase. Not that she wanted to. But she found herself slowly letting go of dream guy and that allowed Cooper in.</p><p>\u201cI love that you get dolled up for the class we have with Cooper,\u201d Taylor remarked.</p><p>Katherine stopped curling her long brown hair and asked innocently, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play coy with me, missy. You\u2019re totally into him. Admit it! You only make yourself this cute when we\u2019re seeing him.\u201d</p><p>Katherine blushed.</p><p>\u201cI knew it. You don\u2019t even have to admit it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d Katherine joked and turned back to the mirror.</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t. But seriously, how great would it be if we dated teammates? We could go to all the games together. And double date all the time. Please just love him already,\u201d Taylor whined.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me that wouldn\u2019t be perfect?\u201d Taylor insisted.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be perfect,\u201d Katherine remarked.</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>Katherine smiled.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were right before you know?\u201d Taylor suggestively mentioned.</p><p>Katherine raised her eyebrows, \u201cAbout???\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Cooper being a great guy. I\u2019m over there all the time and he really is everything you thought he was.\u201d</p><p>Katherine felt her pulse elevate, \u201cWell that\u2019s good to know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAny appearances from dream guy?\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s face paled at the mention of him, \u201cNope. He\u2019s just gone. I was probably stupid to think he was real in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Taylor grabbed Katherine\u2019s shoulders, \u201cYou were not stupid. I\u2019m the one who insisted he was real. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. It\u2019s okay,\u201d Katherine fought against the mist that formed in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cSo hey, Danny and I are going to grab some dinner after practice tonight. Do you think you want to come with?\u201d</p><p>Katherine knew what Taylor was up to, \u201cThat would be nice. Do you think Coop will be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can guarantee that if you\u2019re going, Cooper\u2019s going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d the thought seemed so absurd to her.</p><p>\u201cAre you crazy, Kat, or just dumb? Cooper has been trying to get you to go out with him since the moment he laid his stupid speckled eye on you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know. I just don\u2019t get why,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t mean that as bad as it sounds. I just don\u2019t get it. Is he like this with every girl, or just me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Why don\u2019t you ask him tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell have you seen him with anyone else? Does he talk about other girls?\u201d Katherine pressed.</p><p>\u201cHe talks about you. All.the.time,\u201d Taylor rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBut whyyyy?\u201d she let out a frustrated sigh. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever wonder why Danny likes you so much? You don\u2019t do you?\u201d Katherine laughed at the absurdity of her question.</p><p>\u201cNo! Obviously he\u2019s smart. Only an idiot wouldn\u2019t want to date me. And since I don\u2019t date idiots, it all works out.\u201d</p> <p>Katherine laughed, \u201cOh my gosh. Get out of here and let me finish getting ready.\u201d</p><p>The girls walked toward their dorm when they heard someone shout and a horn honk. They both turned to see Cooper and Danny yelling at them from Cooper\u2019s black Jeep Wrangler. The top was off the Jeep and the guys were shirtless.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they know they look like a couple of douche bags?\u201d Taylor pondered.</p><p>\u201cIt might be our civic duty to inform them,\u201d Katherine rolled her eyes towards the boys.</p><p>\u201cI mean, really...girls everywhere will thank us,\u201d Taylor nodded with a smile.</p><p>They ran over towards the lifted Jeep and Katherine felt dwarfed by the size of it. The oversized off-road tires made it really high off the ground and Katherine thought it made the car more masculine and fun. She thought it simply suited Cooper better, who looked incredible with his shirt off. Her eyes followed the traces of his broad, tan shoulders to his muscular arms. She lingered a little too long on his overly defined abs as Taylor cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cSo, guys, you know that you look like losers driving around like that, right?\u201d Taylor informed them and Danny dipped his head down. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that we all KNOW you have amazing bodies...is it really necessary to drive around with your shirts off?\u201d</p><p>Danny looked up and said, \u201cWe just wanted to get a tan.\u201d</p> <p>Katherine burst into laughter because his response was so sincere. \u201cWell, you guys should go lay out or something, not drive around in the Jeep with your shirts off. You look like cocky jerks who are just trying to show off their nice bodies.\u201d</p><p>Cooper pinned her with his eyes and asked, \u201cYou think I have a nice body?\u201d Then he turned to Danny and gloated, \u201cSee, I told you she wanted me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. She can\u2019t stop dreaming about it, Coop. Every night she screams out your name while she\u2019s sleeping. It\u2019s getting really annoying,\u201d Taylor retorted.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes to get you to go out with me, Katherine Johns, I\u2019ll take it,\u201d Cooper said in his normal confident tone.</p><p>\u201cWill you at least put on a shirt?\u201d Katherine asked with a smile as she looked into his sunglass-covered eyes.</p><p>\u201cMost likely, but I can\u2019t guarantee that it will have sleeves,\u201d Cooper negotiated.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, where am I...Jersey shore? This is like a nightmare\u2014Taylor, please wake me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wake you up, but you won\u2019t let me do anything for you,\u201d Cooper teased playfully.</p><p>\u201cHere we go again,\u201d Taylor tossed her head back in mock disgust.</p><p>\u201cTaylor, will you please talk to your roommate and tell her to cut me some slack already. She makes me work way too hard.\u201d</p><p>Katherine was deafened by the sound of her heart pounding in her ears.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she wants you to work hard?\u201d Taylor offered.</p><p>\u201cThen I will. I\u2019ll do whatever she wants me too,\u201d Cooper smiled at Katherine and her stomach twisted into knots.</p><p>Katherine wondered why though, in the moments where she should be completely consumed in all things Cooper, she couldn\u2019t stop her thoughts from drifting to the boy from her dream. The very thought of him snapped her into some subconscious world. It was as though she could literally feel him all around her. She knew that seemed crazy so she tried to enjoy the life that happened right in front of her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see you guys later tonight,\u201d Taylor said as she leaned in to give Danny a quick kiss on the lips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget about those shirts,\u201d Katherine joked while she mimed pulling on a shirt.</p><p>\u201cMmm, they do look good,\u201d Taylor commented as she glanced back at the two guys in the lifted Jeep. \u201cThey probably have seat belt tans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re right. We are so asking them later!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd make fun of them relentlessly if they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you that Cooper\u2019s parents have a lake house?\u201d Taylor suddenly remembered.</p><p>\u201cNo. Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh it\u2019s in Northern Jersey. It\u2019s right on the shore. Apparently it\u2019s super nice. I think they have a couple of other houses too. I think his parents are loaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s cool,\u201d Katherine responded nonchalantly.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t impress you?\u201d Taylor marveled.</p><p>\u201cNot really. I don\u2019t really care about that kind of stuff,\u201d she hesitated and then questioned, \u201cYou don\u2019t either, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please. Danny\u2019s broke as a joke. I could care less.\u201d</p><p>Katherine nodded in agreement, \u201cIt\u2019s not about money. I was surrounded by people like that back home. As if having a ton of money made up for having a crappy personality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right? Why are rich people such a bore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCause they don\u2019t have to be fun\u2014they\u2019re rich!\u201d Katherine laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t buy chemistry,\u201d Taylor noted.</p><p>\u201cAGREED!\u201d Katherine practically shouted. \u201cI just want that feeling you get when you know without a doubt that you\u2019re supposed to be with someone. That connection, that no matter what you do, can\u2019t be denied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel like that with Cooper?\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s cheeks burned, \u201cI do. But I also felt it with the guy from my dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sorry, I hate that I keep doing that.\u201d</p><p>Taylor cocked her head to one side, \u201cDoing what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m over the guy from my dream, but I\u2019m not. It\u2019s like he won\u2019t go away. Everytime I think he\u2019s gone, he reappears. Whenever I try to think about only Cooper, Dream Guy pops into my thoughts. I feel like he\u2019s planting himself in my brain so I won\u2019t forget about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s not doing that,\u201d Taylor eyed her sympathetically.</p><p>Frustrated, Katherine took a deep breath, \u201cTaylor, I\u2019m making a conscious decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a first,\u201d Taylor responded in her typical sarcastic tone. \u201cWhat exactly are we so conscious about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to put the guy from my dream behind me. He has to just go back to whatever part of my subconscious he came from. I can\u2019t keep waiting for him to show up at Starbucks or something!\u201d she huffed.</p><p>\u201cAnd I have to give Cooper a chance. He\u2019s a really nice and good guy. And I\u2019d be an idiot to let him walk away because I\u2019m holding out for some guy I saw in a dream one time. Right?\u201d Katherine needed Taylor to agree.</p><p>\u201cYep, you\u2019d be an idiot all right. But I still sorta think your dream guy could exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaylor!!!\u201d Kat pleaded; her voice exasperated.</p><p>\u201cFine, fine. Yes, you have to give Cooper a chance. Your country would want this. If you don\u2019t date Cooper, the terrorists win. Happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfectly,\u201d Katherine smiled at Taylor and knew what she had to do. She had to get dolled up for the date tonight and really open her heart to Cooper. It wasn\u2019t like she didn\u2019t want to. If there were no dream guy, she was certain she and Cooper would have already been together. She was very aware that she set the pace for this relationship...or whatever it was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so excited!\u201d Taylor wailed.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause! I\u2019ve been waiting for this day to come. And Cooper is awesome. And you\u2019re going to love him. And if you want to talk about dream guys...well, Cooper is one.\u201d</p><p>Music played in the background while the girls got ready for their dinner date. Every so often they\u2019d stop what they were doing and break out into dance. Katherine tried on four different tops before she agreed with Taylor which one looked best.</p><p>Katherine pulled at her straight brown hair and twisted it around the hot curling iron. She watched as loose, fat curls fell around her face. She added a shiny gloss to her lips and puckered.</p><p>\u201cTay, are you almost ready?\u201d Katherine shouted.</p><p>\u201cReady when you are.\u201d</p><p>They headed out of the building and into the still evening air. Giant trees lined the pathway, leading them away from campus. The small one-story brick restaurant sat nestled between two larger, more contemporary buildings.</p><p>\u201cYou know they wanted to pick us up, right?\u201d</p><p>Katherine perked up, \u201cNo. Did you tell them they couldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them that we could walk. Plus, we\u2019re not going to be able to for long. We actually have winter in this state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat cold, huh?\u201d Katherine asked concerned.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. You\u2019ll probably die.\u201d</p><p>Katherine gave Taylor a shove, \u201cYou suck.\u201d</p><p>The restaurant was owned by an older Italian gentleman, in every sense of the word, named Dominic. Every time the girls walked in, he would greet them with hugs and kisses on each cheek and say, \u201cCiao, bella,\u201d which meant, \u201cHello, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Every so often he would slip and speak to them excitedly in his native tongue, forgetting that the girls had no idea what he was saying. Katherine always loved when he did that because she thought the language was so beautiful.</p><p>When they walked through the door, the guys were already there. Dominic saw them and his eyes lit up. He hustled right over and greeted them with his usual flair. He spoke in his accented English that the girls had grown to adore. \u201cYou two are here-ah with the boys in the corner, si? They look-ah like perfecto gentlemen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSi!\u201d Taylor said back. \u201cYou know Dominic, you really should teach us more Italian so we can sound just as sexy as you do when you speak.\u201d</p><p>The old man blushed and hustled the girls over toward their table, \u201cStop it, bella. You make-ah old man feel silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwwww, Dom. You know we love you!\u201d Katherine said, giving him an extra tight squeeze.</p><p>\u201cYou girls ah...are the best. You both look fantastico tonight! Have-ah fun.\u201d He put his two fingers and his thumb to his lips and kissed them as if the girls were a perfect dish he had just created for royalty.</p> <p>Katherine couldn\u2019t help but notice how Cooper\u2019s eyes lit up at the sight of her. She wondered if she\u2019d ever get used to the way he looked at her and then she secretly hoped she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>It didn\u2019t escape her that he made her feel things too. For example, from the moment she looked over and saw his face, she hadn\u2019t been able to stop smiling. And she started to get that familiar feeling she got whenever she was near Cooper Donovan. Her pulse raced and her heart felt like it was going to beat out of her chest. If her body told her anything, it was that it really liked this Cooper character.</p><p>Danny hopped out of the booth as Taylor jumped into his arms and wrapped her legs around his waist in the sweetest display of bear-hug and affection Katherine had ever seen. Everyone in the restaurant turned to stare, but the couple didn\u2019t seem to notice or care. They gave each other a kiss before Danny gently placed Taylor\u2019s feet back on the restaurant floor.</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d Danny said with a bow as he directed her to get into the booth.</p><p>\u201cKind sir,\u201d Taylor responded with flair as she scooted in.</p> <p>Katherine moved into the booth so that Taylor was on her left and Cooper was on her right.</p><p>\u201cYour hair looks really pretty,\u201d Cooper admired her curls and Katherine blushed.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she replied as calmly as she could.</p><p>Cooper looked at her and smiled. Every time she looked into his green eyes, she felt herself unable to look away. She couldn\u2019t help it, though. They were easy to get lost in. She focused mostly on the one with the speck in it. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s his only flaw,\u201d she thought to herself.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to eat or are you two just going to stare into each other\u2019s eyes all night?\u201d Taylor interrupted.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Katherine said in response.</p> <p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m fine with doing either,\u201d Cooper said as he bit his bottom lip. Of course, that was just one more thing Cooper Donovan did that seemed to drive her completely crazy. She noticed the sweat again and cursed under her breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that, Miss Johns?\u201d Cooper asked her.</p><p>\u201cNothing, Mr. Donovan. You just...well it\u2019s just that...you make me sweaty,\u201d she finally blurted out, and then looked at Taylor horrified. She couldn\u2019t believe she had actually said that out loud.</p><p>Danny laughed as he turned to Taylor and asked, \u201cDo I make you sweat, Tay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I can help it,\u201d she replied lovingly at him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do anything right. I hate you, Donovan,\u201d Danny moped.</p><p>\u201cStop being such a wimp in public. It\u2019s embarrassing,\u201d Cooper razzed.</p><p>\u201cAh, come on, Danny. Stop. Maybe my sweat glands just don\u2019t work the same as Kat\u2019s do. She is from California and all. Maybe she has like movie star sweat glands or something?\u201d Taylor said sweetly.</p> <p>Cooper leaned over in the midst of all the chaos and whispered into Katherine\u2019s ear, \u201cI like that I make you sweat. It means you like me.\u201d</p><p>His breath was warm on the side of her face and she felt tingly as she struggled to maintain her composure. She never knew that a whisper could make her feel that way; it almost stopped her from functioning at all. She had to remind herself to keep taking in air because breathing no longer came naturally.</p><p>She looked over at him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t do that to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do what?\u201d His smile was virtually irresistible and he looked at her as though he could read every thought she ever had with just one glance. \u201cHave I ever told you that you have gorgeous eyes?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready to be complimented by him. She wasn\u2019t ready for anything when it came to him. \u201cNo, you haven\u2019t. But, thank you,\u201d she responded, her breath catching.</p><p>They ordered dinner and while they waited for it to arrive Katherine realized she didn\u2019t really know much about Cooper.</p><p>\u201cI have to ask you about your Jeep,\u201d she started off.</p><p>\u201cMy Jeep? What about my baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering. Did you do all the work to it yourself, or are you the type of guy who pays someone to do all the hard things for you?\u201d</p><p>Danny and Taylor both shouted \u201cOuuuch!\u201d in unison. Katherine didn\u2019t try to be rude, she just wanted to see what kind of man Cooper Donovan really was.</p><p>\u201cFor your information, I did everything to that Jeep myself. My dad helped with some things when I needed an extra set of hands, but otherwise, I did it all. It took me months to take it apart and rebuild it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>He winked at her before saying, \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>She was flustered again. \u201cSo...how long have you been playing hockey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been playing since I could lace up my skates and get on the ice. My dad encouraged me at first, but then I fell in love with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo your parents pressure you to play? Do you get along with your parents? Do you have any brothers or sisters?\u201d Katherine shot questions at him like a rapid-fire interrogator.</p><p>\u201cGeez, Detective...slow down,\u201d Taylor teased before she turned to give Danny a quick peck.</p><p>Cooper laughed in response before he answered, \u201cI don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll tell you anything you want to know Katherine. My parents don\u2019t pressure to me to play at all. While my dad definitely encouraged playing as I was growing up, if I didn\u2019t love it, he wouldn\u2019t want me to keep playing.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders and then continued, \u201cThey just want me to be happy, and if that means playing hockey, then so be it. I have a great relationship with my parents, but I don\u2019t need to see them all the time. I like keeping them at a distance. Not because I don\u2019t enjoy them, but I just prefer to be on my own. Does that sound terrible?\u201d</p><p>Katherine sensed that he might not be sure of how he sounded. It was the first time he actually seemed vulnerable since she\u2019d met him all those weeks ago. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound terrible at all. I can totally relate. My parents are great, but I don\u2019t feel like I need to see them or talk to them all the time. I love them and all, but I love myself and my freedom more...you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Cooper responded enthusiastically. \u201cI feel the same way. And yes, by the way, I have two brothers and one sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly cow. Big family,\u201d Katherine was an only child, so she thought anything more than one was a lot. She couldn\u2019t imagine that many kids under one roof.</p><p>\u201cWe are Irish,\u201d Cooper joked.</p><p>Katherine forgot she was on the East Coast where Irish and Italian families were prevalent. They were typically large with family members that lived close by and constant family gatherings. She didn\u2019t feel like family life was the same in Southern California at all.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so different here than back home,\u201d Katherine commented.</p><p>\u201cGood different or bad different?\u201d Cooper asked her while their food was being handed out to them.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely good different. Probably because it\u2019s all new to me. Everything is different out here, from the people, the buildings, the trees and even the food.\u201d Katherine looked over at Cooper\u2019s face before she continued, \u201cBut I love it and I totally appreciate everything that is different from what I\u2019m used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re different from what I\u2019m used to,\u201d Cooper remarked, giving her one of his trademarked looks.</p><p>He threw his arm around the back of the booth and his fingertips gently touched a part of Katherine\u2019s shoulder. She glanced back to make sure it wasn\u2019t her imagination playing tricks on her. Nope. Those were definitely Cooper Donovan\u2019s fingers that brushed against her bare skin.</p><p>She tried to concentrate on breathing again. It was the obvious the way he affected her. It partly intrigued and excited her, but it also annoyed her. The last thing she wanted to do was to come off like another one of those girls who couldn\u2019t contain themselves in Cooper Donovan\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cSo, California, any more questions?\u201d he asked politely.</p><p>\u201cActually, I do have one more.\u201d Katherine looked at Taylor whose expression told her she couldn\u2019t wait to hear this one. \u201cWhy does everyone treat you like a god or something? What is the deal with you?\u201d</p><p>Danny and Taylor laughed out loud. \u201cIt\u2019s true, bro. he girls are ridiculous when it comes to you!\u201d Danny blurted out while he still laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Cooper, why are you New Jersey\u2019s freaking royalty?\u201d Taylor added, as she mimicked a reporter with a microphone.</p><p>Cooper just looked at them all and fell silent. He gave Katherine one long glance before he said, \u201cI guess it\u2019s the hockey thing.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders. \u201cPeople think I\u2019m going places and I think they just want to come along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are going places, Donovan,\u201d Danny added and then turned to Katherine. \u201cHe\u2019s probably the best this college has seen in the past ten years. He\u2019s going pro and everyone knows it.\u201d</p><p>Katherine smiled at Danny\u2019s enthusiasm. \u201cIs that true?\u201d</p><p>Cooper removed his arm from behind Katherine\u2019s shoulder, and then crossed them both in front of his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s the rumor. But we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you want to do?\u201d Katherine wondered.</p><p>Cooper smiled, \u201cNo one ever asks me that. They always just assume that I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Cooper answered nonchalantly and continued to eat his pasta.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you don\u2019t know? Coop, come on. If the Rangers called you up right now and said they needed you to start playing for the team tomorrow, you wouldn\u2019t go?\u201d Danny asked in a surprised tone. \u201cI\u2019d give anything to be in your position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then I\u2019d tell them to call my buddy D Rossi and they\u2019d be in good hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, thanks man,\u201d Danny said it so sweetly it made the girls giggle.</p><p>\u201cGreat, I\u2019m caught in a love triangle,\u201d Taylor looked at Danny and rolled her eyes. He leaned in to kiss her sweetly and she let him. Taylor\u2019s eyes opened wide and she quickly shouted, \u201cWait! Wait...I have a question! But it\u2019s for both of you guys.\u201d</p><p>The guys smiled and only imagined what would come out of Taylor\u2019s mouth. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cShoot,\u201d said Danny.</p><p>\u201cWell, Kat and I were wondering if you guys could lift up your shirts for a second?\u201d Taylor looked at Katherine and winked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why? Our shirts?\u201d the guys said, as they talked over each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell after all your tanning and driving today, we were wondering if either of you got seat belt tans.\u201d Katherine started to crack up uncontrollably and she turned to Cooper to try to lift up his shirt to see.</p><p>\u201cSeat belt tans? I don\u2019t get it,\u201d Danny responded, confused.</p><p>\u201cIf you want us to take our shirts off, ladies, all you have to do is ask. You are the ones who told us to put them on in the first place. You two are giving us mixed messages. How are we supposed to ever know what you really want?\u201d Cooper asked sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cShow us. Lift up your shirts so we can see!\u201d Taylor demanded.</p> <p>The boys did as they were told and faint seat belt lines marked across their chest. The girls burst into hysterics and the guys looked down, shaking their heads.</p><p>The group finished their dinner and the guys took care of the bill. The girls gave Dominic big hugs and kisses on the cheek before they left. The guys shook Dominic\u2019s hand before he turned to the girls and said, \u201cI approve, si. They seem-ah like good guys. Ciao, bellas!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCiao, Dominic!\u201d the girls shouted in unison as they walked out the door.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>The weather had definitely started to change and Katherine noticed how chilled the evening air had become as compared to a few weeks ago.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m totally going to have to buy a real coat, aren\u2019t I?\u201d Katherine commented as she threw a sweatshirt over her head.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t own a jacket?\u201d Taylor laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never needed one before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can always borrow one of mine. I have a hundred. Cause we have seasons here. Do you know what seasons are?\u201d Taylor teased.</p><p>\u201cWe have seasons in California!\u201d Katherine shouted defensively.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Summer and summer light?\u201d Danny interjected.</p> <p>\u201cYou two are made for each other.\u201d Katherine stuck her tongue out at the couple.</p><p>\u201cSo, what are we up to now? Where should we go?\u201d Taylor wondered out loud. \u201cOh wait, should we give you guys alone time? Yeah, maybe you guys should hang out by yourselves for a bit? Danny and I can head back to his place if you want?\u201d Taylor looked at the budding couple.</p><p>The thought made Katherine nervous. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t want to be alone with Cooper, it\u2019s just that she had a good idea where this headed and once again, her mind drifted back to the boy from her dream. She tried to shut him out, but no matter what she did, the thought of him always lingered. It was as if he existed in a part of her now and if she tried remove him, it would be as useless as if she tried to pull her own arm off. He was a permanent fixture.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you prefer, Katherine,\u201d Cooper didn\u2019t want to chase her away by being too enthusiastic, but he did crave alone time with her. \u201cBut I do have someplace I\u2019d like to show you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God Cooper, really? Let me guess, the stars in your bedroom?\u201d Taylor said while she stuck her finger down her throat and pretended to puke.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think so little of me, Taylor?\u201d He turned to Katherine and said, \u201cIt\u2019s nowhere near my bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Katherine thought one last time of the boy from her dreams, took a deep breath and turned to Cooper and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d She gave Taylor a hug who whispered in her ear, \u201cHave SO MUCH fun. Call if you need anything.\u201d Danny gave Cooper some hockey guy handshake/fist bump thing and Katherine smiled as Taylor and Danny walked away from them, hands intertwined.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Cooper grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s not far, I promise. Are you cold, California?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, thanks.\u201d</p><p>They walked slowly and she wondered if he was going to try to hold her hand. Part of her definitely wanted that. Part of her screamed for it. But the other part, well the other part was clearly off limits. She wondered if she should throw all caution to the wind, be brave, and grab his hand instead ...but she couldn\u2019t do it. She needed to know that if Cooper Donovan\u2019s fingers suddenly found themselves intertwined in hers, it was because he wanted to and not because she had initiated it. This was New Jersey\u2019s royalty after all. The thought made her giggle out loud.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d he glanced over at her and smiled.</p><p>\u201cJust hearing Taylor in my head is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I understand completely now. I like her, she\u2019s funny. And informative,\u201d Cooper grinned mischievously.</p><p>\u201cInformative? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good at answering my questions, that\u2019s all,\u201d Cooper bit his bottom lip.</p><p>Katherine\u2019s eyes quickly darted away from his mouth. \u201cWell, yeah. She\u2019s the best. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are lucky you found each other. You should send flowers to whoever paired you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlowers? Really?\u201d she responded playfully.</p><p>\u201cOr a card. I\u2019m just saying.\u201d He laughed and then gave her a little shove. She lost her balance far more than he had intended. He grabbed her by the arm to swiftly pull her back to him. He held her tightly against his body, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, California. Didn\u2019t mean for that to happen.\u201d His heart pounded through his chest against hers. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Warmth raced through Katherine\u2019s body as her heart sputtered. If there was ever a perfect moment for a first kiss this was it and she knew it. \u201cI\u2019m fine, sorry. It\u2019s the shoes...and the feet walking in them.\u201d She tried to regain her composure.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said as he pulled her toward him. \u201cI\u2019ll help from now on.\u201d</p><p>He threw his arm around her and tucked her frame into his. She loved that he was so much taller than she was and she was surprised at how comfortable he was to snuggle into. She half expected a body that looked that chiseled to feel like stone, but it didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there,\u201d he told her.</p><p>They were still on campus, but Katherine\u2019s classes had never taken her to this part of the school before. She saw a gray stone building with columns and arches that reminded her of some sort of church. She still hadn\u2019t gotten over how old everything on the East Coast was. The way the buildings looked were unlike anything she\u2019d ever seen back home. They walked to a large, oversized oak door and Cooper tugged on one of the black iron door handles.</p><p>\u201cIs this a church? Are you taking me to church?\u201d Katherine started to get nervous. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t like or respect church or anything. It was just that, well...she didn\u2019t go.</p><p>\u201cI guess you could say it\u2019s my church.\u201d He unlocked the door.</p><p>\u201cWait. How do you have a key to a school building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the captains have a key to the rink,\u201d he explained.</p><p>She breathed a sigh of relief. He walked inside, hit one of the light switches and walked toward the first row of seats closest to the ice. Katherine followed close behind.</p><p>She was in awe. She noticed the long wooden benches instead of individual seats. She quietly wondered how uncomfortable those got after long periods of time. \u201cWow. So this is where you play? It\u2019s so old. When was it built?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her and then looked around at everything as he spoke. \u201cThey built it in the early 1920s. It\u2019s named after the school\u2019s greatest athlete at the time. It was the school\u2019s sign to potential students that they were ready to get serious about sports.\u201d</p><p>She looked around at the championship flags that hung from the ceiling. Cooper continued, \u201cThey redid it not too long ago, but it was important to the school administrators, the boosters, alumni, and the team at the time, that the look of the rink was to remain unchanged. You know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>He paused to look her in the eyes and let her know that it was important to him as well. She smiled slightly and nodded her head. \u201cThere is so much history here that no one wanted it torn down and rebuilt from the ground up. So the majority of the changes are behind the scenes. The locker rooms...the way the ice is refrigerated and cleaned....the lighting and the glass around the rink. All necessary updates, but you wouldn\u2019t know it didn\u2019t always look this way if someone didn\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>There were light fixtures that hung in between exposed steel beams. It was bigger than she thought it would be and far less extravagant. He explained to her how he thought the size was perfect because there weren\u2019t any bad seats in the house. He took her around the whole rink and they sat in different areas just to prove it. \u201cSee? No matter where you sit, you\u2019re never far from the action.\u201d</p><p>She agreed and smiled. She liked to see him talk about the sport that held his heart. He was excited, knowledgeable and passionate. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the rink from every seat in the house. Now come see things from my point of view.\u201d He walked her through a door and onto the ice.</p><p>\u201cAm I allowed to be on here? Isn\u2019t this sacred ground or something?\u201d Her shoes were slippery on the ice and she half expected to fall.</p><p>He laughed, \u201cJust look around, California. This is how I see things.\u201d She imagined what it was like to be him in a game as she looked at every seat from every angle. She agreed his view was the best.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you love.\u201d He looked at her and her pulse started to sprint. \u201cAbout hockey, I mean,\u201d she clarified.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI love the smell of the ice. When we first walked in here, did you smell it? And the cold. The sound the puck makes when it\u2019s sliding across the ice or when it hits the net for a goal...as long as it\u2019s our goal,\u201d he smirked.</p><p>\u201cI love the sound of hockey sticks crashing against each other. The sound my skates make when I come to a hard stop. The roar of the crowd. The way I feel when I\u2019m playing. I can do things on this ice that I can\u2019t do anywhere else.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cHow\u2019s that for an answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect.\u201d Cooper looked down and gently tucked a strand of hair that was out of place behind her ear. Then he looked her in the eyes and angled her face up toward his.</p><p>She knew what would come next. She closed her eyes and his mouth was on hers. His lips were incredibly soft and his kiss was so gentle. He seemed to handle everything he touched with care. Especially when it came to her.</p><p>His hand had moved to the back of her head and his fingers were lightly entangled in her hair. She lifted her hand and placed it on the side of his face. Her other hand was on his shoulder, partly for balance. She felt that kiss from Cooper Donovan all the way down to her toes.</p><p>When he finally pulled away from her she kept her eyes closed for just a moment longer. When she opened them, he looked right at her and simply said, \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t agree more. It was one hell of a \u201cwow.\u201d That was the kind of kiss people wrote books about...or made movies about. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to ruin the moment, but we should probably go,\u201d he apologized.</p><p>Her mind was so wrapped up in that kiss, she barely heard him. And Cooper couldn\u2019t wipe the smile off his face. He helped her off the ice and then took her hand in his. He led her up the stairs and out the door. He turned to lock the door and they walked silently for a few minutes before Katherine said, \u201cCooper, can I ask you something?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnything,\u201d was his response.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d Her question was innocent enough. Hadn\u2019t she witnessed girls literally throw themselves at his feet in the past? She just wondered what it was about her that made him like her so much. Plus, part of her really wanted to hear it. If he had to think about an answer, formulate it into words and then say them out loud, then it would be real.</p><p>\u201cCalifornia, I wish you could hop into my head and see yourself through my eyes. Then you wouldn\u2019t have to ask. But for the record, I\u2019m extremely attracted to you. I have been since the first day I laid eyes on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeckled eyes,\u201d Katherine commented, as she laughed.</p> <p>\u201cYes, since the first time I laid my speckled eye on you,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>They continued to walk and his thumb gently caressed her hand as he held it. \u201cYou\u2019re different from the girls out here. You\u2019re honest and that\u2019s rare. I don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re trying to be someone you\u2019re not...and you don\u2019t apologize or make excuses for that. You are who you are, end of story. You don\u2019t treat me the way other people do and I really like that.\u201d He brought her hand up to his mouth and kissed it softly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about hockey, which is great \u2019cause then you won\u2019t be able to tell if I suck or not. Plus, you\u2019re nice and funny and...\u201d</p><p>She cut him off mid-sentence; she couldn\u2019t take any more. \u201cOkay. No more. I know I asked, but please stop. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then, why do you like me?\u201d he asked her in return.</p> <p>\u201cWho said I do?\u201d she said and then smiled devilishly at him. He stopped, and took her face into his hands. He leaned down and kissed her slowly and tenderly. She nearly fell this time. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that to me...my knees can\u2019t take it. One of these times, I will fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I will catch you. Don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but I\u2019m kinda strong,\u201d he informed her.</p><p>\u201cOh no, I didn\u2019t notice,\u201d she added. They weren\u2019t far from Katherine and Taylor\u2019s dorm and she was partly disappointed that the night was about to end so soon, and partly relieved. She could only take so many of those kisses from Cooper in one evening.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m bringing you back so soon, but I have to be on the ice at five tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the morning?\u201d she asked him, horrified.</p><p>\u201cOn the rink with the roosters!\u201d he told her enthusiastically, as he mimicked someone, but she didn\u2019t know who.</p> <p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what my coach always says.\u201d</p><p>Katherine scrunched her face, \u201cI\u2019d tell him I\u2019d rather be on the rink with whatever gets up later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEh, I\u2019m used to it. Just part of the job,\u201d he winked at her when he said it.</p><p>\u201cThank you for an incredible evening, Cooper. I had a great time.\u201d She didn\u2019t know if she was supposed to hug him, or kiss him again, or what. So she just sort of stood there. She didn\u2019t want to seem too eager and she wanted him to make the rules.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. Thanks for moving here and coming to my school and falling head over heels for me.\u201d</p><p>She interrupted his speech with a sarcastic, \u201cUh-huh,\u201d but he continued to talk. As he spoke, he got closer and closer to her lips.</p><p>\u201cThanks for being gorgeous and smart and fun. And thanks for...\u201d He leaned in and kissed her one last time before he finished his sentence. He made sure to wrap one arm around her waist. He knew that if her knees did give out he could catch her one-handed. His other hand was on her face, and it brushed the side of her cheek.</p> <p>Katherine\u2019s pulse sprinted just as quickly as it did with the first kiss. But then it happened. An image flashed in her mind and she realized it was the guy from her dream. It happened so quickly, but she recognized him instantly. He looked hurt, or confused. It made her stomach flip and her chest felt like it had collapsed inside of her. She gasped and pulled back from Cooper.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you okay?\u201d He held on to her tightly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Sorry, that was weird. I thought I saw someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, wait, wait. You were kissing me with your eyes open? This isn\u2019t a good start to our relationship, California. I think open-eye kisses mean we\u2019re doomed.\u201d He said it like a joke, but there was an air of concern in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. My eyes were closed. It was in my head. I mean, I thought I saw someone in my head.\u201d Katherine knew if she tried to explain this would sound as crazy as she felt at that moment, so she just stopped. \u201cNever mind. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you after practice.\u201d He gave her a quick kiss goodbye and she turned to walk into her building. Just then a group of girls walked out and squealed when they saw Cooper. Katherine stood there for a minute to watch the display. She could tell this sort of thing made him uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cHi, Cooper!\u201d said one of the girls.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d asked another.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Cooper, where are you going? Can we come along?\u201d the prettiest of the girls asked. Cooper told them he had to go so he could be ready for practice in the morning.</p><p>\u201cWe can help you be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Cooper, let us help you.\u201d The girls were relentless. They begged and pleaded and said the kinds of things that girls shouldn\u2019t say. Cooper was nice, but firm. He told them goodnight and continued to walk.</p><p>One of them pulled out a camera and it flashed in Cooper\u2019s direction. Katherine heard the faint conversation about \u201chis butt\u201d and \u201chow hot\u201d he was and then a lot of giggles. She couldn\u2019t believe the way girls treated him. She looked in his direction one last time and he looked at her. She gave him a quick wave before she turned around and headed into her building. Right before she walked through the door, her cell phone beeped. It was a message from Cooper.</p><p>\u201cThanks again for the great evening. Sorry about the girls. Call you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Katherine walked through the door and wondered if Taylor would be home from Danny\u2019s yet. She heard Taylor\u2019s voice yell excitedly, \u201cAhhhh! Tell me everything! Did you kiss? Do you love him? Does he love you back? Dur, of course he loves you. Where did he take you? What did you do? WHY AREN\u2019T YOU ANSWERING ME YET?\u201d</p><p>Katherine loved Taylor\u2019s craziness. When she got this excited about something, it was really hard not to get excited with her. Katherine looked at Taylor\u2019s face, which beamed with excitement and said, \u201cHe really is amazing. And those lips!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you did kiss! Who kissed who...tell meeeee!\u201d Taylor whined.</p><p>\u201cHe kissed me. It was perfect. His kiss was perfect...the moment was perfect...everything was...perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything this guy does that isn\u2019t perfect?\u201d Taylor asked her, but it wasn\u2019t really a question. It was definitely more of a statement.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d Katherine said in response.</p><p>\u201cSo...what did he want to show you? I asked Danny what he thought it was, but he said he had no clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! He took me to the hockey rink. He told me all about it and why he loves it. He brought me on the ice and everything. It was really sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe brought you on the ice? Interesting,\u201d Taylor said in a different tone.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Katherine asked her nervously.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of a big deal, Kat. He took you to the rink. He showed you where he lays his heart on the line every day. He took you on the ice. Hockey players don\u2019t bring girls on the ice, Kat!!!\u201d</p><p>Katherine just shrugged her shoulders and gave her a funny look. Taylor started again, \u201cUgh! Let me put this in terms you\u2019ll understand. It\u2019s like if you were dating a baseball player and he brought you onto the field. Guys don\u2019t bring just any girl onto the field, Katherine. Don\u2019t you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get what you\u2019re saying, but I don\u2019t get what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper Donovan is totally falling for you. Can I spell it out any more clearly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can tell that because he brought me on the ice? You\u2019re crazy, Taylor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but you\u2019re doomed. He\u2019s going to love you and every girl on this campus is going to hate you for it.\u201d Taylor smiled at her. Katherine laughed out loud, but she knew there was an air of truth to what Taylor said.</p><p>\u201cIf that isn\u2019t motivation to start dating the guy, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d Katherine smirked. \u201cI\u2019m tired, Tay. I\u2019m gonna get ready for bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too!\u201d Taylor joined her in the bathroom and the girls washed their faces and brushed their teeth.</p><p>Katherine fell asleep quickly, but not before she thought about the flash of the face she saw when Cooper kissed her. She couldn\u2019t quite figure out why this strange guy wouldn\u2019t leave her thoughts. She hoped that if it meant something deeper, he\u2019d come back to her and explain it. She kept to herself the hope for him to reappear. Hadn\u2019t she promised Taylor she\u2019d get over him? Didn\u2019t she just have an incredible evening with Cooper? She fell asleep as she replayed every moment of that first kiss.</p><p>Katherine walked along the beach. The air was warm and the waves crashed at her feet. She glanced in front of her and saw a short silhouette running toward her. Before she knew it, there was a golden retriever that playfully jumped at her and wagged his tail. She bent down to pet him and he started to lick her face. \u201cCome here, Brody! Brody, come!\u201d</p><p>Her heart instantly started to hum and her mind raced to place the familiar voice. She glanced up and saw him smile at her. His muscular body was silhouetted by the sunset. Her hazel eyes immediately found his blue ones and her heart literally skipped a beat. \u201cSorry about Brody. He\u2019s a really bad dog. His owner must be a schmuck.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I love dogs.\u201d</p><p>He reached out his hand. She grabbed it and electricity shot through her with a force so strong, she almost let go. Scenes suddenly flashed through her mind. Glimpses of life, but she wasn\u2019t sure whose. He gave her a smirk, and chills raced down her spine. She knew that smile, but she couldn\u2019t remember where from.</p><p>She was jolted out of slumber by the sound a cell phone ring. \u201cHello?\u201d she answered before she looked at the caller ID.</p><p>\u201cPerfect, you\u2019re up!\u201d Cooper said happily in her ear.</p><p>\u201cWell, I am now,\u201d she whined.</p><p>\u201cGet Taylor and meet us outside in twenty. We\u2019re taking you girls on a picnic!\u201d He was so damn cheery that it made her want to punch something.</p><p>\u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d he laughed loudly into the phone. \u201cSee you in a bit!\u201d He hung up and she looked over at Taylor who sat up in bed and wondered what was going on.</p><p>\u201cThat was Cooper and Danny. Apparently, we\u2019re going on a...picnic?\u201d Katherine was tired. She wanted to tell Taylor that she had dreamed about the guy again but she decided to keep it to herself, for now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you kidding me? That is so cheesy! But also kinda sweet.\u201d Taylor mentioned that they should probably get up since the guys were always on time.</p><p>\u201cIt is sweet, but Cooper Donovan on a picnic? Are you kidding me? Picnics, um, not very manly.\u201d Katherine couldn\u2019t for the life of her imagine either Cooper or Danny on a blanket eating out of a picnic basket. The thought made her laugh.</p><p>\u201cWe should definitely make fun of them,\u201d Taylor suggested, \u201cbut not until after we eat.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s cell phone beeped and she looked down at the text from Cooper. \u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d she shouted at Taylor, who had put her shoes on in the bathroom.</p> <p>When they got outside, the guys waved at them from the Jeep. A few girls waited to see who Cooper Donovan was picking up. They looked Taylor and Katherine up and down and then stayed to watch. It was too much for curious girls to resist.</p><p>\u201cYou girls look so good walking over here to us,\u201d Danny said loud enough for everyone around to hear.</p><p>Katherine\u2019s eyes met Cooper\u2019s and nerves shot down her spine. \u201cYeah, but my girl looks the best.\u201d Cooper said as he hopped out and gave Katherine a huge hug and a quick kiss. \u201cNo offense, Taylor.\u201d The crowd of girls started to whisper when he said \u201cmy girl\u201d and Katherine knew it was about to start.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. We all know I\u2019m ridiculously hot and you just don\u2019t like blondes. Your loss,\u201d Taylor remarked in her perfected sarcastic tone.</p><p>The foursome drove away from the crowd of gawking girls. \u201cIf I see so much as the hint of a picnic basket, I\u2019m outta here,\u201d Taylor informed the guys. \u201cLike really. I\u2019ll jump out of this Jeep, I swear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe like you and everything but what kind of guys do you think we are?\u201d Danny quipped in response.</p><p>\u201cThe kind that apparently take their girlfriends on picnics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, as sweet and romantic as real picnics are, I\u2019m sure...we have our own style of doing things. We just didn\u2019t know what else to call it,\u201d Cooper interjected.</p><p>Katherine was relieved. \u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold your horses, California. We\u2019re almost there,\u201d Cooper glanced at her and gave her a half smile. That simple look made her pulse race. She wondered if he\u2019d ever stop having that effect on her.</p><p>Cooper pulled the Jeep into a parking spot and the group hopped out. Danny and Cooper grabbed bags and a small cooler out of the trunk. \u201cCome on.\u201d Danny threw his free arm around Taylor while Cooper grabbed Katherine\u2019s hand and led her to a small patch of grass on the riverbank.</p> <p>Danny started to throw down a blanket. He knew Taylor was going to make some sort of sarcastic comment about how wimpy this made them so he cut her off before she had the chance. \u201cIt\u2019s either this, or we sit in the mud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you spread it out,\u201d Taylor jumped up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really pretty here,\u201d Katherine commented as she watched the water rush over the rocks.</p><p>\u201cAh! You saw Dominic without us?\u201d Taylor whined.</p><p>Katherine turned around and glared at the boys. \u201cNo fair!\u201d</p><p>Cooper and Danny started taking out the deli sandwiches they had bought from Dominic\u2019s restaurant. They pulled out a bag of fresh homemade potato chips with parmesan and truffle. Danny opened the cooler and took out some bottled waters, bottled teas, and soda.</p><p>\u201cThis is really nice you guys. Thank you,\u201d Katherine said to both Cooper and Danny.</p><p>Cooper smiled, \u201cBut you still think we\u2019re manly and tough, right?\u201d</p> <p>Katherine eyed Taylor before responding, \u201cThat\u2019s a tough one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, this isn\u2019t really what tough manly guys do,\u201d Taylor added.</p><p>\u201cIt is when they\u2019re not jerks,\u201d Cooper piped back in response.</p><p>\u201cYeah! Just because we\u2019re manly doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t be nice!\u201d Danny protested.</p><p>\u201cYou two make valid points,\u201d Katherine noted.</p><p>\u201cAgreed. You\u2019re still tough and manly and this picnic is hot.\u201d Taylor scrunched her face and closed her eyes as Danny kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cSo, how was practice?\u201d Katherine asked Cooper.</p><p>\u201cIt was good,\u201d Cooper scooted his body closer to hers.</p><p>\u201cCoach is tough,\u201d Danny added.</p><p>\u201cOh, wah,\u201d Taylor pretended to wipe tears from her face.</p><p>\u201cYou are such a brat, Miss Taylor!\u201d And with that, Danny jumped toward her, tickled her and pinned her down. \u201cNow what are you going to do, little girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, get off me. I hate you,\u201d she yelled at him playfully and tried to push his manly frame away from her.</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. You loooove me,\u201d he kissed her nose.</p><p>\u201cDream on!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is the toughest, but best, coach I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d Cooper backed up his teammate. \u201cWe have a practice game next Tuesday. Will you come?\u201d He looked at her with puppy dog eyes.</p><p>\u201cOnly if you stop looking at me like that,\u201d Katherine admitted.</p><p>Cooper leaned in and gently brushed his lips against her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful. I want to look up from the ice and see you in the stands.\u201d</p><p>Katherine struggled for a response, but no words came.</p><p>\u201cOf course we\u2019ll come,\u201d Taylor said with excitement.</p><p>Katherine noticed Cooper still staring at her so she whispered, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to watch you play. I\u2019m really excited.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her hand and brought it to his lips, \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>Danny stretched out on his back as Taylor placed her head on his stomach. \u201cUgh, it\u2019s like laying on a rock,\u201d Taylor joked.</p><p>\u201cNothing but steel, babe,\u201d he joked back and played with her blonde hair.</p><p>Cooper stood and reached for Katherine\u2019s hand. He gently pulled her up and led her to the edge of the river. He wrapped his strong arms around her from behind. She leaned into his body and felt the warmth he radiated. When he kissed the side of her cheek, her heart raced and she silently begged her body to not start sweating.</p><p>Suddenly, a golden retriever ran up to the couple and barked incessantly in Katherine\u2019s direction. She immediately pushed Cooper away and looked around wildly for him. She hoped beyond all reason that the guy from her dream would run up to get his dog. She imagined what it would be like for them to see each other in person for the first time. Was this what her dreams had meant? Was she about to come face to face with him? The anticipation and hope gnawed at her.</p><p>Katherine scanned the distance when she heard a female voice yelling, \u201cSam? Sam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s over here,\u201d Cooper yelled in response.</p><p>The pretty girl ran over and grabbed the barking dog by the collar, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. He never acts like this. Come here, Sam. You are such a bad dog!\u201d</p><p>The girl leashed up her dog, \u201cHe never does that. It\u2019s so weird.\u201d</p><p>Katherine looked at the dog and felt her heart drop inside her chest. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. He just startled me is all.\u201d</p><p>Katherine sat down on the blanket and stared at the ground as the girl left. Cooper sat down next to her and asked with concern, \u201cAre you okay? Are you scared of dogs?\u201d</p><p>It seemed like everything he said made her laugh. \u201cNo, I love dogs. Not necessarily the ones you put in your purse, but...\u201d her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cThose are called oversized rats,\u201d Danny chimed in and Taylor hit him in the arm.</p><p>\u201cHey! What if I want an oversized rat, mister?\u201d Taylor asked him.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll buy you one. But my dinosaur dog might eat it and then you can\u2019t get mad.\u201d</p><p>Katherine thought about the dog, her dream, and her guy. Every time she started to get lost in her thoughts, Cooper would rein her back in. \u201cWhere do you keep going on me, California?\u201d He asked her quietly, as he pressed his cheek against hers.</p><p>She looked up at him and said, \u201cNowhere. Just thinking is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much. Just that dog...and my dreams,\u201d she glanced over at Taylor who gave her a look and shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAm I in your dreams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so typical Cooper. I thought I already told you she can\u2019t stop dreaming about you and all that crap. You think I was joking?\u201d Taylor quipped and Katherine was thankful for her interference.</p><p>\u201cI was just asking. Sheesh, Taylor.\u201d Cooper kissed Katherine on the cheek and softly said, \u201cI get it. No more questions.\u201d</p><p>The group lay in the sun for a while longer before they packed up and headed back to the dorms. Taylor and Katherine both had papers to write and the guys had to work out with the team.</p><p>Once they were back in their room, Taylor cornered Katherine in the bathroom. \u201cSo, are you going to tell me what\u2019s really going on?\u201d</p><p>Katherine gave her a look, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just had another dream last night with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You dreamt of him again? How could you not tell me this? Kat, this is a big deal!\u201d Taylor got excited again and Katherine wondered if she would regret telling her.</p><p>\u201cIt was a super quick dream. Nothing happened. Like literally, he was there and then I woke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoring. But hey, if you dream about him any more, you have to tell me. Don\u2019t leave me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Katherine agreed begrudgingly.</p><p>Taylor narrowed her eyes, \u201cDon\u2019t leave me out. On another note, today was fun, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt really was.\u201d Katherine\u2019s heart warmed as she replayed the day in her mind. \u201cDanny is so into you. It\u2019s really cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be adored,\u201d she said, very matter of fact. \u201cHe makes me laugh. And you\u2019ve clearly won over that Donovan kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would appear so,\u201d Katherine could admit that Cooper definitely liked her. \u201cI like him too, don\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. It\u2019s just this mysterious dream guy,\u201d Taylor understood. \u201cJust promise me you won\u2019t give up on Cooper because you\u2019re haunted by these crazy dreams, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Katherine said reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Kat. Don\u2019t do it. Cooper\u2019s great and you\u2019d be an idiot to mess it up. Plus I live with you, so if you go screwing up Cooper Donovan, I\u2019ll have to hear about it from the whole freaking state. I can only take so much.\u201d Taylor walked over and gave her a hug, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>Katherine was thankful that Taylor understood and she appreciated the fact that she didn\u2019t have to hide anything from her. \u201cI love you, too. Thanks for being here for me. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be lost and have horrible friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>The sun set behind Katherine as the ocean\u2019s waves crashed before her. She watched a group of dolphins jump playfully in the water from the bench she sat on. She couldn\u2019t remember them ever being so close before. And then there was the moon. It rose to her left and was spectacular. She wished she had brought her camera.</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d she thought to herself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, stranger.\u201d The voice cut through her like a sharp knife and she turned to see him above her.</p><p>She almost choked as her heart leapt into her throat. His broad shoulders blocked out the setting sun. His facial features and hair looked as if someone drew them. Nothing was out of place. She had almost forgotten how flawless his skin appeared. And his eyes were such a radiant color of blue she wasn\u2019t sure exactly how to describe them. He was the very meaning of the word perfection.</p><p>She could barely get the words out to actually speak; she was too caught up in how he looked and how his presence made her feel. \u201cWhere have you been? I\u2019ve been waiting for you. What took you so long?\u201d she asked nervously, unsure of what his response would be.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been gone. It\u2019s hard to get through that steel trap of yours,\u201d he joked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Steel trap?\u201d she responded, confused. \u201cOh, my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You try so hard to see me that you end up blocking me out. Tonight was really the first night you fully let go. It made it easy for me to slip in and find you,\u201d he informed her. \u201cOf course, I understand why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that makes sense, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Katherine smiled and her whole body filled with warmth and love. She stood up to hug him. He was taller than she was, but not by much. She guessed that he was probably just about six-feet, maybe five-eleven. She wrapped her arms around his waist and refused to let go. Brody wagged his tail as sand scattered in every direction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much,\u201d Katherine told him, her voice shaking. This boy made her feel things at a level she couldn\u2019t wrap her head around. Every emotion felt as if it was rooted in the very fiber of her being. Nothing else mattered. Nothing else existed. There was no Cooper here. There was nothing but the two of them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you more than you know.\u201d He sat on the bench and she followed his lead. \u201cThis will be our spot from now on. When you want to find me, you\u2019ll come here to this beach and sit on this bench. And I\u2019ll always find you. I\u2019ll always come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d she asked him, genuinely.</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d he reassured her as he stroked her fingers. Katherine could feel her eyes welling up with tears. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked her and gently touched her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I just have this feeling...like I\u2019m going to lose you.\u201d She felt her chest tighten and knew she was going to cry.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d He looked into her eyes. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll never leave you. I\u2019m so sorry for what happened last time,\u201d his face writhed with pain.</p><p>\u201cLast time?\u201d The words stung with familiarity, but she couldn\u2019t quite grasp what he meant.</p> <p>\u201cYes, in our last encounter. Or I guess I should call it our first encounter...or more accurately, your first encounter with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Last time,\u201d she looked away from his gaze and settled on the sand at her feet. Her mind struggled to put the pieces together. She willed it to assemble this puzzle, but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember, do you? That\u2019s okay. Control over your memories while we\u2019re together will come with time.\u201d She still had no idea what he meant, but she didn\u2019t care. All she cared about was being with him. He smiled at her and she felt her heart melt.</p><p>\u201cTime to get up, sunshine. Oh, sleeping beauty. Nappy head. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that,\u201d Katherine thought to herself. She could feel herself being pulled away from the beach...and the bench...and him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know your name,\u201d she yelled out, but it was too late.</p><p>She looked at the smile on his face one last time and then opened her eyes. Taylor stood above her.</p><p>\u201cJeez, Kat. That only took me like twenty minutes. For the love, get up girlfriend, you\u2019re going to be late.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTaylor?\u201d Katherine was confused. \u201cTaylor, I was dreaming about him again. Oh my gosh. That was intense.\u201d Katherine shouted out with a smile. She quickly realized what she said and her smile faded. \u201cA dream. Dang. Every time I wake up, I\u2019m sad all over again that it wasn\u2019t real. But this time was different...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! Tell me everything,\u201d Taylor sat on the edge of her bed.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense. I\u2019m not sure what this guy is. I mean, he told me that he would always find me. And that we had a spot. And I just have to go there anytime I want to see him. And what the hell is going on? It\u2019s weird right? Am I making it all up? Is this crazy? Oh good Lord, what is happening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of questions all at once, Kat. So, um...yes, you are crazy. Duh. Yes, it\u2019s extremely weird. But it\u2019s also extremely cool. I have no idea if you\u2019re making it up, but who cares? I mean, they\u2019re just dreams, right?\u201d Taylor responded calmly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. But weird as hell dreams. And I mean, what about him always finding me? It was like we were having a conversation. He apologized for the last dream I had with him in it, but I didn\u2019t know what the heck he was talking about at the time. Man, I\u2019m so dumb when I\u2019m dreaming!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What do you mean...apologized? Like for going and getting himself shot, or what?\u201d Taylor asked.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. But he said he was sorry for our last encounter...or my first encounter with him or something. He made me feel like he knows me, but I swear to you I\u2019ve never seen anyone as hauntingly perfect as him. He almost looks NOT real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is weird, Kat. I mean, do you think this guy was talking to you...like...he could come back every night if you wanted him too and stuff?\u201d Taylor asked; her voice intrigued. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of anything like this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear, Taylor, I\u2019m just as confused as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Cooper?\u201d Taylor\u2019s question crashed Katherine back into reality.</p><p>\u201cOh, God. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like when I dream about this guy, there is nothing and no one else.\u201d Katherine\u2019s heart felt like it was ripping in half. She knew the guy from the dream meant more to her than anyone she\u2019d ever known. But she also knew Cooper made her feel ways she\u2019d never experienced either. \u201cDo I have to choose? I mean, really? At this point...do I have to choose between them?\u201d She knew the question sounded a little absurd.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what are we choosing again? Between a real life super hottie and a guy that only appears in your dreams? I think the choice is obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy for you to say...you\u2019re not the one having the dreams.\u201d</p><p>Katherine didn\u2019t know what to do. She wasn\u2019t sure how she felt, or what the rules were for something like this. Did she have an obligation to let Cooper know that she was seeing someone else? But that it was only while she was asleep? This was crazy and she knew it. Just because Dream Guy said he could come back, maybe he wouldn\u2019t. Maybe it was all some crazy made up fantasy.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019ll go away,\u201d Taylor suggested.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him to go away, Taylor. Do I tell Cooper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him what? You\u2019re dreaming about some guy you\u2019ve never met and you want to have ten thousand of his babies? I mean, really Kat...even if you did tell Cooper, you think he\u2019d just walk away from you? Not a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m just being crazy. You should probably keep a mental ward on speed dial though. Just to be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready done,\u201d Taylor smiled at her. \u201cAre you excited for the game tonight?\u201d</p><p>Katherine was grateful for the subject change. \u201cYes! I can\u2019t wait! But Taylor, I\u2019m not kidding when I tell you that I know NOTHING about hockey, so you\u2019re going to have to help me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be a pro in no time,\u201d Taylor winked.</p><p>As they walked across campus Katherine noticed Taylor giving other girls dirty looks. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Katherine chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI am about to lose my mind on these stupid females.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Katherine looked around and noticed all the sour looks aimed in her direction.</p><p>\u201cIt would be one thing if you were a total bitch or something, but you\u2019re not. You\u2019re normal and nice and they\u2019re just mad that he didn\u2019t pick them,\u201d Taylor snapped.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll like me once they get to know me?\u201d Katherine genuinely believed that people were good at heart. She had been around celebrities in LA enough to know how other girls behaved when they were jealous.</p><p>\u201cGod, you are so na\u00efve! East coast girls can be really mean, Kat. They don\u2019t care how nice you are. All they care about is that some California girl just rode into town and took their property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what am I supposed to do?\u201d Kat started saying \u201chi\u201d to all the girls who looked at her cruelly.</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, STOP doing that. What is wrong with you? These girls are not your friends. Stop being so nice to everyone.\u201d</p><p>Katherine laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding. Saying \u2018hi\u2019 isn\u2019t going to make them like you. It\u2019s only going to make them hate you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s stupid. And I\u2019m not going to stop being nice so they can feel better.\u201d</p><p>Cooper sauntered up and took Katherine by the hand as he pulled her tightly against his chest. \u201cMorning,\u201d he gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. She immediately felt the heat rise inside of her.</p><p>\u201cGeez, Cooper, are you trying to start a riot?\u201d Taylor glared at him.</p><p>\u201cIt has to happen sooner or later,\u201d he said before he looked at Katherine. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh it\u2019s okay, I have my bodyguard Taylor over here.\u201d Katherine caught herself thinking about the boy from her dream. She looked at Cooper and knew she should focus on what was right in front of her, but her heart wouldn\u2019t let her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Taylor said with attitude.</p><p>Cooper laughed, \u201cComing to the game tonight?\u201d</p><p>Taylor looked at Katherine, \u201cNo, I think there\u2019s a new show on we wanted to watch. You don\u2019t mind, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, that show looks amazing. Can\u2019t miss it, sorry,\u201d Katherine smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cLadies, you\u2019re breaking my heart here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that was a stupid question. Of course we\u2019ll be there. You think I want to see my boyfriend cry?\u201d Taylor teased.</p><p>\u201cTrue, true. It\u2019s not pretty, I\u2019ve seen it,\u201d Cooper remarked.</p><p>\u201cCome on Katherine. Hurry up! I want to get to the rink early,\u201d Taylor whined.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming. What\u2019s the rush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to watch Danny warm up. And I also want to get a good seat. People on this coast actually like hockey, you know.\u201d</p><p>Katherine appeared out of the bathroom, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>At the rink, Katherine followed Taylor into what she considered perfect seats and sat. She breathed in the cold air and smiled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just love being in here,\u201d Taylor told her with a smile. \u201cOh, I see Danny!\u201d</p><p>Katherine looked around the ice for Cooper. When she spotted him she noticed him wink at her through his facemask. Her insides fluttered.</p><p>The seats quickly filled up and before Katherine knew it they had formed the \u201cgirlfriends section.\u201d It was the area of the rink where all of the girlfriends of the guys on the team ended up sitting. All the other girls knew exactly who Taylor and Katherine were, and exactly who they were there to watch play. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Kristie. I\u2019m dating Tommy. He\u2019s number 39.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Katherine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m Taylor.\u201d</p><p>Introductions went all around and Katherine thought to herself that it was the first time other girls were actually being nice to her when it came to Cooper. She relaxed her shoulders and attempted to watch the game she knew nothing about.</p><p>The crowd went crazy when the team skated onto the ice but nothing was louder than the cheers for Cooper when they introduced him over the loudspeakers. Katherine felt a glow of warm pride inside her.</p><p>Cooper skated around on the ice effortlessly. The way he moved and stopped was as easy for him as walking. This was a side of him she didn\u2019t see everyday. Being a hockey player brought out his tough edges. He couldn\u2019t walk around and punch people on campus but on the ice it was a different story. He could be rough, aggressive, and powerful. And he was. She watched him slam people into the sides of the rink and wondered how they didn\u2019t get hurt.</p><p>She noticed the other team was always very aware of where he was and they tried their best to stop his every move. But no one could stop Cooper Donovan on the ice. He made goals, assisted with goals, and led his team to victory. Now she understood why people treated him the way they did. He was like a god when he played and it was incredible to watch. People wanted to be part of it because it was special.</p> <p>After the game the girls followed the other girlfriends downstairs into a secluded tunnel area. There was a door that led to the locker room and it was the only way in or out.</p><p>Katherine turned to Taylor and whispered, \u201cDo you think Cooper\u2019s parents are here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even think about it, but I bet they are,\u201d Taylor looked around.</p><p>The door swung open as Danny and Cooper walked out together, smiling widely. Cooper\u2019s eyes darted into the crowd as he looked for familiar faces. He spotted Katherine and his face softened. She started to walk toward him when she noticed a couple motion him over. He kissed the short, dark-haired woman on the cheek and gave the older, gray-haired man a hug. He looked back at Katherine and waved her over. She started to shake nervously with each step.</p><p>\u201cMom, Dad, this is Katherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mr. and Mrs. Donovan. It\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d Katherine said with kindness.</p> <p>Cooper\u2019s dad welcomed and greeted Katherine with a warm hug, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too, Katherine. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d Katherine shot Cooper a surprised look.</p><p>\u201cYes, Katherine. Nice to meet you,\u201d Cooper\u2019s mother reached out her hand to greet her with a firm shake. Her tone of voice was cold and unfriendly. Katherine noticed Cooper\u2019s eyes narrow in disapproval.</p><p>He turned to Katherine before his mother could do any more damage and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to grab some dinner with my parents. I\u2019ll call you later. Thanks for coming to the game,\u201d he bent down and kissed her lips with longing.</p><p>Katherine blushed. Embarrassed, she quickly responded, \u201cOf course. It was a lot of fun. \u2019Bye, Mr. and Mrs. Donovan. It was nice to meet you.\u201d She spotted Taylor and rushed over.</p><p>\u201cOh hey. Dad, this is Taylor\u2019s roommate Katherine. She\u2019s also Donovan\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re the lucky girl? Nice to meet you, kid.\u201d Danny\u2019s dad shook her hand and then pulled her in for a hug.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, too. Are you sure you\u2019re not Danny\u2019s older brother or something, you look so young!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I like this girl,\u201d he winked.</p> <p>\u201cYou can have her,\u201d Taylor joked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you both.\u201d The girls giggled and Danny shuffled his feet.</p><p>\u201cDad! We\u2019re gonna get some food. Do you want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You two go. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d Taylor offered.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Danny asked again.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m sure. Plus, you guys need time alone. You can see me anytime. It was nice to meet you, sir,\u201d Taylor smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou too, beautiful. I\u2019ll make sure he takes good care of you.\u201d He threw his arm around his son and squeezed him tightly, \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t, I will.\u201d</p><p>Danny pretended to choke and his dad just squeezed him harder. He squirmed out of the choke hold and ran over to Taylor. He gave her a quick kiss before he headed out of the rink with his dad\u2019s arm draped over his shoulders. Katherine and Taylor walked toward their dorm.</p><p>\u201cSo, did you meet Cooper\u2019s parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. His dad was so nice, but his mom...\u201d Katherine couldn\u2019t hide her hurt feelings.</p><p>\u201cWhat about her? Was she mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was kind of mean,\u201d Katherine explained. \u201cShe was super cold and not very friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t read into it, Kat. A lot of the moms out here are overly protective of their baby boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not kidding. They all claim they want their sons to find good girls but the truth is...no girl will ever be good enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, she hates me because her son likes me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, she doesn\u2019t really hate you. She just doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re good enough for her precious Cooper,\u201d Taylor laughed.</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s a relief.\u201d Katherine understood, but she wanted Cooper\u2019s parents to like her. She jumped when her phone rang.</p><p>She looked at the screen and answered, \u201cHey, Coop. Aren\u2019t you at dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I just wanted to apologize for my mother\u2019s behavior and tell you I\u2019m sorry. She\u2019s like that with everyone. I think it\u2019s an Irish mom thing. It just takes a while before she warms up to people. I should have warned you. I just didn\u2019t want you to feel bad or take it personally, okay?\u201d</p><p>The phone was quiet. \u201cOkay? Katherine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. It just sucks,\u201d she moped.</p><p>He let out a quick laugh, \u201cI know. But it\u2019s not you. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Hey, thanks for calling.\u201d Katherine hung up and looked at Taylor, \u201cWell, you were right. Some sort of crazy Irish mom thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you. But that was really sweet of him to call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s good like that,\u201d Katherine agreed.</p><p>Katherine walked into the dining hall on campus and looked around frantically for her friends. She hated standing alone in a crowd. Her eyes darted from table to table before she spotted Taylor waving her arm wildly in the air.</p><p>Cooper elbowed Danny, \u201cSlide down a seat so Katherine can sit next to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo bossy,\u201d Danny yawned before moving over.</p><p>Cooper pulled the chair out slightly and Katherine sat down. He leaned over and gave her a quick peck on the cheek before returning to his food.</p><p>Katherine looked at the plate in front of him and her eyes widened. \u201cHow can you eat all of that?\u201d</p><p>Cooper looked down, \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you not five hundred pounds?\u201d Katherine shook her head.</p><p>\u201cOh Kat, speaking of food\u2014I keep meaning to ask you, are you going home for Thanksgiving?\u201d Taylor wondered as Cooper instantly perked up.</p><p>\u201cHuh? Oh no. I can\u2019t fly all the way to California for Thanksgiving. But I\u2019ll go home for Christmas. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you ever going to tell me that?\u201d Taylor chastised her.</p><p>\u201cUm, probably when it got closer,\u201d Katherine told her politely.</p><p>\u201cKatherine, it\u2019s in two weeks! How do you not know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sheesh. Taylor, I\u2019m not flying home for Thanksgiving. I\u2019m staying here. Happy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only be happy if you agree to come home with me.\u201d Before Katherine could answer Taylor added, \u201cIt\u2019s not really a question because you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could always come home with me,\u201d Cooper interjected.</p><p>Cooper Donovan had just invited her to his house for a holiday meal. She just about choked on her food. \u201cOh yeah. I\u2019m sure your mom would love that,\u201d Katherine blurted out. She tried to recover and quickly added, \u201cI mean, I really want to meet Taylor\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled, \u201cNot that yours isn\u2019t great, it\u2019s just that I think I\u2019d feel more comfortable at Tay\u2019s house, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, California. I get it.\u201d He threw his arm around her and gave her a squeeze. \u201cMy family isn\u2019t good enough for you. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. That\u2019s not what I...\u201d He cut her off with a kiss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m teasing,\u201d he comforted her. \u201cAnd what did I tell you about my mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat she\u2019s like that with everyone,\u201d Katherine sighed.</p><p>\u201cExactly. So please don\u2019t take it personally. She\u2019ll love you soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Katherine smiled, but she wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Kat. My mom will be nice to you,\u201d Taylor said snidely, and looked in Cooper\u2019s direction. Cooper made a face at her and she stuck out her tongue.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that, Donovan. It\u2019s not my fault your mom\u2019s mean,\u201d Taylor said through her laughter.</p><p>\u201cMy mom just loves me more than your mom loves you,\u201d Cooper noted.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s probably true.\u201d</p><p>The laughter faded into the background as Katherine\u2019s thoughts drifted. She found herself excited at the idea of leaving campus for awhile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really excited Taylor. Thank you,\u201d Katherine beamed.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Cooper and Danny came over to see the girls off and say their goodbyes. This was going to be the longest they\u2019d been apart since they started to date. Katherine was amazed at the amount of people in the parking lot. It almost felt like the first day of school. She looked around and noticed that no one glared in her direction. It seemed as though Cooper Donovan having a girlfriend wasn\u2019t front-page news any more. She was thankful.</p><p>Danny squeezed Taylor, \u201cI\u2019m going to miss you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t miss me if I\u2019m dead,\u201d she choked out. He loosened his grip and then kissed her sweetly.</p><p>Cooper and Katherine were engaged in their own public display of affection. They looked into each other\u2019s eyes, and didn\u2019t speak a word. She put her hand on the side of his face and rubbed her thumb near his eye with the speckle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss this eye,\u201d she said and then kissed just above it.</p><p>\u201cOnly this one?\u201d he smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I totally play favorites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Cooper picked her up and kissed her. His soft lips brush against hers. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you.\u201d The words came out so sweetly that she knew he genuinely meant them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you, too.\u201d Even though part of her heart was somewhere else, other parts of it were reserved exclusively for Cooper Donovan and Katherine recognized that. She loved the way she felt when she was around him.</p><p>The guys grabbed the bags that were on the ground and packed them into the trunk of Taylor\u2019s car.</p><p>\u201cYou have enough gas right?\u201d Danny peered in to look at her gas gauge.</p><p>Taylor swatted at his head, \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot. I know how to drive. God, you\u2019re annoying.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper leaned into the window and gave Katherine one last kiss before he paused to look into her eyes. \u201cOut of the car, Donovan, before you lose your head,\u201d Taylor lipped.</p><p>Taylor started to back out and was about to hit the gas pedal when she heard, \u201cYou know I\u2019m totally in love with you, Taylor Dailey!\u201d</p><p>Danny had just yelled the \u201cL\u201d word...in a parking lot...at school...in front of a bunch of people. Taylor slammed on the breaks, put the car in park, jumped out and hopped into his waiting arms.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Cooper jogged over to Katherine and laughed. Her body tensed. She hoped and prayed he wasn\u2019t going to tell her the same thing. She wasn\u2019t ready for that. She knew she cared about Cooper Donovan, but she wasn\u2019t sure she loved him. She wasn\u2019t sure she could. How can you only give part of your heart to someone and call it love?</p> <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t say it, please don\u2019t say it, please don\u2019t say it,\u201d she repeated in her head.</p><p>\u201cDanny\u2019s crazy. That kid has no shame,\u201d Cooper huffed.</p><p>Katherine watched as his heavy breathing made his chest go in and out. Sometimes she found it hard to get past that body.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to tell you one last time that I\u2019ll miss you.\u201d He hesitated, \u201cAnd steal another kiss.\u201d He put his head through the window and desperately clutched a fistful of her hair. He kissed her like her needed her. His mouth searched for comfort in hers. She felt dizzy with desire.</p><p>Taylor hopped back into the car, stopping their kiss cold. Katherine\u2019s lips suddenly felt empty. \u201cSee ya later Cooper,\u201d Taylor hinted. Cooper backed out of the car as Taylor hit the gas. Katherine locked eyes with him as he faded into the background.</p><p>\u201cSo, how\u2019s it feel to be in love?\u201d Katherine teased.</p> <p>\u201cHa! That was crazy! I can\u2019t believe he did that. He\u2019s such a dork. But I\u2019m on cloud nine right now if you want to know the truth,\u201d Taylor glowed.</p><p>The girls laughed, sang and talked while they drove the mere hour and a half to Taylor\u2019s house. Taylor didn\u2019t say much about her family. The whole \u201cI love you\u201d thing had sent her down a different path. Katherine sang along with a song on the radio as she felt the car slow. She noticed a long, dirt driveway up ahead. Taylor turned onto it and pulled behind the house.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Taylor jumped out of the car as the front door opened.</p><p>An attractive older man with brown hair and twinkling blue eyes suddenly appeared. \u201cKatherine, this is my dad, Jack. Dad, this is my roommate, Katherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Katherine smiled and held out her hand.</p><p>\u201cWe hug in this family. Come here, girl.\u201d Taylor\u2019s dad gave her a giant bear hug. Katherine immediately liked him. \u201cAnd you can call me Dad, too. Or Jack. Whichever you prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d She looked at Taylor and informed her, \u201cIt\u2019s just easier to call him \u2018Dad.\u2019 Plus it\u2019s more fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s totally more fun,\u201d Taylor agreed.</p> <p>\u201cYou never told me your dad was so hot. Why were you holding out on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross. You would know, you\u2019re the one who was dreaming about him, remember?\u201d Taylor joked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get your bags, girls...go inside and say hello to your mother and brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mr. Dailey!\u201d</p><p>The girls ran inside the house and yelled for Taylor\u2019s mom. They found her in the kitchen. Her short brown hair and kind eyes lit up at the sight of the girls.</p><p>\u201cOh, hi girls! Taylor, you look too skinny! Have you been eating?\u201d she quipped.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mom. Jeez. I do eat, ya know. Katherine, please inform the woman of my eating habits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she eats. It\u2019s a wonder she isn\u2019t three hundred pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, this is my roommate slash comedian friend, Katherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mrs. Dailey. It\u2019s really nice to meet you. Thanks for letting me come over, I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Katherine, call me Janice, please. And we\u2019re just so happy to have you.\u201d She gave Katherine a quick squeeze before she turned to Taylor. \u201cYour brother is out back in the barn. Go find him will you and let him know you\u2019re here? Maybe you can get him to go out with you girls sometime this weekend? You think he\u2019ll go?\u201d</p><p>Katherine noticed the tone of the conversation changed and she wondered if something was wrong with Taylor\u2019s brother. She imagined he had some sort of deformity or clinical issue where he never left the house.</p><p>\u201cYou have a brother?\u201d Katherine asked through her confusion.</p><p>\u201cYep. Let\u2019s go see him,\u201d Taylor pulled Katherine by the arm into the back yard.</p><p>\u201cTaylor, your back yard is amazing. I can\u2019t believe you have a barn. And horses! You never told me you had horses!\u201d She glanced to her left, \u201cAnd a trampoline?\u201d Katherine got excited, \u201cWhat else don\u2019t I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty. Let\u2019s go find Blake first.\u201d</p><p>Katherine wanted to ask her if there was something wrong with Blake. She wanted to be prepared for what she was about to see or experience. She wanted to brace herself and not give away whatever she was going to feel with her expression. \u201cWait, Taylor...is there...\u201d They rounded the corner into the barn before Katherine could ask anything.</p><p>\u201cSis!\u201d Blake stood up from a makeshift poker table where he sat with friends. He was taller than Taylor and had the same sandy brown hair as his mother. He was cute for a high school boy. He had an athletic build and a familiar face.</p><p>Katherine thought to herself, \u201cHuh. Doesn\u2019t look like anything is wrong with him. Weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, little brother,\u201d They hugged and their bond was immediately apparent.</p><p>\u201cBlake, this is my roommate, Katherine. Katherine, this is my little brother, Blake.\u201d Taylor looked around at the rest of the guys in the room, \u201cAnd these are all of his degenerate friends.\u201d The group of guys all started to talk smack at Taylor, but she dished it right back.</p><p>\u201cHi, Katherine. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d Blake was more reserved when it came to Katherine.</p><p>\u201cHi, Blake. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, B, I\u2019m going to show Kat the rest of the house and stuff. We\u2019ll come back out to see you later...and kick your butts in poker!\u201d The girls started to turn and walk out of the barn.</p><p>\u201cTay?\u201d Blake called after her. Taylor turned around and looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re home,\u201d he said sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI missed you too, Blakey-Face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems sweet. You guys have an amazing relationship,\u201d Katherine commented.</p><p>\u201cWhen our brother died we only had each other. Our parents could barely get through the day, let alone deal with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You had a brother who died? I had no idea. Taylor, when did this happen? I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Katherine was shocked she knew nothing about this and wondered why Taylor had never told her. She thought maybe she should have been warned of what she walked into, but she couldn\u2019t blame Taylor. I mean, how do you bring up the fact that your brother died? When is that ever the perfect story to tell?</p><p>\u201cIt was a little over two years ago. Austen, that was his name, was sleeping in the passenger seat and his friend Tony was driving. It was a really stormy night and there was this big rig. The driver hit something in the road and he lost control. He cut off their car and there was no time for Tony to react. They said he didn\u2019t even have time to hit the brakes, it all happened so quickly. Tony and Austen died instantly.\u201d</p><p>Taylor took a breath before she continued. \u201cOur parents fell apart. Our town fell apart. I know you wouldn\u2019t know it, but my parents are just now starting to get some sense of normalcy back. Blake and Austen were close. And when Austen died, Blake was never the same. He stopped playing baseball. He stopped going out. He stopped living his life. And I\u2019m so worried that he\u2019ll never be the way he used to. And I don\u2019t know how to fix him.\u201d</p><p>She got emotional and Kat put her hand on her shoulder. \u201cI was a wreck for so long, but I knew that I couldn\u2019t just curl up in a ball and die, right? Austen wouldn\u2019t want me to give up on my dreams of going to college. But it\u2019s hard. Every day is hard. He was my older brother and I looked up to him and admired him and I miss him more than I can ever tell you.\u201d</p><p>Katherine cried while she listened and Taylor cried through it all. There hadn\u2019t been nearly enough time to get over a loss like that. Katherine reached over to hug Taylor and the embrace made them both cry even harder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Katherine. I know I should have told you sooner, but it was never really the right time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I totally understand. I\u2019m happy to know now.\u201d Katherine realized that Taylor\u2019s behavior toward guys suddenly made sense. She couldn\u2019t get hurt or deal with loss if she didn\u2019t let them in.</p><p>The girls walked together and wiped at their tears. Taylor showed Katherine around the simple four-bedroom house. She told her she could sleep in the guest room, but Katherine opted to sleep with Taylor in her room. She liked the way Taylor\u2019s house felt. It was comfortable. It felt lived in and loved. It reminded her of home.</p><p>That night at dinner, Taylor\u2019s parents asked about Danny. Taylor\u2019s face lit up. \u201cHe\u2019s so great, Mom. You\u2019ll love him. He\u2019s cute and funny and he totally adores me. And Dad, he\u2019s a hockey player.\u201d</p><p>Her dad just smiled and said, \u201cOf course he is, dear,\u201d and he patted her shoulder. Blake sat there and looked at Katherine, but never said a word. He listened to the girls talk and smiled every once in a while. Katherine thought he looked familiar, but she couldn\u2019t place from where. She tried not to stare.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Katherine? I heard you\u2019re dating some hockey stud, or something. Isn\u2019t that right, Taylor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dating THE hockey stud of New Jersey, Mom, get it right,\u201d Taylor added.</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. So what\u2019s he like?\u201d Taylor\u2019s mom asked a lot of questions.</p><p>Katherine noticed the deep sadness that clouded her eyes. She couldn\u2019t imagine how painful it must be to lose a child. She wondered if you ever got over something like that, or if you were always damaged beyond repair. Katherine assumed it was the latter.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really great. He\u2019s super nice and confident and ridiculously hot,\u201d Katherine laughed when she said it. The conversation flowed as Taylor told stories about how the girls on campus acted around Cooper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey treat him like that?\u201d Blake finally spoke up. \u201cHe must love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, to be honest, I think it kind of bothers him,\u201d Katherine responded. She felt like she knew Cooper well enough at this point to speak for him.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Blake\u2019s eyes squinted and his mouth smirked. \u201cGirls throwing themselves at you everywhere you go? People giving you things, treating you like royalty? What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Taylor interjected, \u201cOh little brother, you would think that stuff is soooo cool. But it\u2019s actually kind of annoying. I feel bad for him whenever we\u2019re out. You can tell that he just wishes people would leave him alone.\u201d She gawked at Katherine. \u201cWell, most people.\u201d</p> <p>Katherine flinched. \u201cI think he just wants to be treated like everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I still think it sounds cool,\u201d Blake imagined.</p><p>\u201cYou should come visit us one weekend and hang out,\u201d Katherine suggested. \u201cCooper would love to show you around,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely!\u201d Taylor agreed. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I ever think of that?\u201d</p><p>Blake smiled and nodded his head while their parents shared a look of relief.</p> <p>The girls insisted on doing the dishes and Blake went back out to the barn. Katherine turned to Taylor and asked, \u201cSo, does he hang out in the barn a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. His friends are always over and I think it\u2019s easier to be out there than in the house, you know? Especially when I\u2019m away.\u201d Taylor knew it was hard for Blake to be in the house around their parents. Everything brought back memories of Austen. It was still a painful topic. \u201cI wish you could have met him, Kat. You would have loved him. Everyone did.\u201d Katherine was sure Taylor was right.</p><p>The girls headed out to the barn to play a couple of hands of poker with Blake and his buddies. One of his friends, Matty, had a huge crush on Taylor. He was adorable with short black hair, tan skin, and dimples to die for. He watched Taylor\u2019s every move and would touch her whenever she\u2019d let him. \u201cOkay, Matty, enough.\u201d Taylor looked at his dimpled face and pinched his cheek. \u201cIf only you were older,\u201d she flirted with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting older every day, Taylor.\u201d Matty was cocky. \u201cYou know we\u2019ll end up together one day.\u201d</p><p>Taylor laughed. She loved this kid like a brother and she wasn\u2019t blind. He was good-looking and it would be a lie if she said she didn\u2019t like the way he crushed on her.</p><p>\u201cGross. I\u2019m sitting right here,\u201d Blake interrupted the potential love fest. \u201cThat\u2019s my sister and you\u2019re my best friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich means we\u2019ll be brothers someday,\u201d Matty winked at Taylor and she started to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI win! You guys suck.\u201d Taylor threw her cards down and stood up from the table. She kissed her brother on the cheek and bent down to tease Matty a little. Then she gave him a peck on the cheek too. \u201cGoodnight, guys.\u201d The girls got up and walked out of the barn.</p><p>\u201cKatherine\u2019s cute,\u201d Blake said, once the girls were gone.</p><p>\u201cYeah, so is your sister.\u201d Blake punched Matty in the shoulder. \u201cWhaaat?\u201d He laughed and Blake gave him a dirty look.</p><p>The girls got ready for bed separately Katherine looked around Taylor\u2019s room while she waited. Taylor had books hidden everywhere...on the bookshelf, in the closet, on her dresser, on the floor. Katherine tried to take it all in when she noticed a picture of Taylor smiling and laughing on the back of a boy who was doing the same. The picture was taken at the beach.</p><p>Katherine\u2019s heart stopped. She did a double take. She grabbed the picture to get a closer look. It couldn\u2019t be. It couldn\u2019t possibly be. She knew those eyes. She knew that smile. Taylor walked into the room as Katherine struggled to calm her nerves.</p><p>\u201cTaylor, who is the guy in this picture with you?\u201d Katherine stuttered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my brother Austen. He was gorgeous, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>Katherine felt light headed and dizzy. The sound of her heart raced in her ears.</p><p>\u201cKat? What the heck is wrong with you? Are you all right?\u201d Taylor asked.</p><p>Katherine stumbled to the edge of the bed and fell onto it. Taylor sat next to her, \u201cWhat is it? Kat, you\u2019re white as a ghost. What is going on? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed from Katherine\u2019s eyes as she shook her head. She mumbled something about \u201cthis can\u2019t be\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d Her hands trembled as she gripped the picture.</p><p>Taylor pleaded, \u201cPlease. Katherine, what it is?\u201d</p><p>Katherine slowly lifted the picture and handed it to Taylor. She tried to explain through her sobs, \u201cThat\u2019s him, Taylor. The guy...in the picture with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother Austen? He\u2019s who? Who, Katherine?!\u201d Taylor\u2019s eyes widened as the realization crashed into her. She rose from the bed and took three steps backward, almost falling over.</p><p>\u201cThe guy from your dreams?\u201d Taylor asked it so softly, Katherine barely heard her.</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s him!\u201d Katherine pointed at the boy in the picture.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense, Kat.\u201d Taylor paced around the room. \u201cIt can\u2019t be him. There\u2019s no way. Look again!\u201d</p><p>Katherine knew she didn\u2019t need to look again, but she wanted to appease Taylor. \u201cThat\u2019s the boy from my dreams. I\u2019m positive.\u201d</p><p>Taylor plopped onto the floor, her head shaking. \u201cNo. I just...it can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Katherine didn\u2019t know what to do or what to say. She watched Taylor go through various emotions and felt guilty for inflicting them.</p><p>Taylor talked softly to herself as she cried. She glanced toward Kat and said, \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand it, either.\u201d She longed to comfort Taylor, but didn\u2019t know how. She was suddenly scared that this realization was going to ruin everything. \u201cTaylor, please don\u2019t be mad. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The thought of losing her closest friend terrified her.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell would I be mad at you, Kat? It can\u2019t be my brother. I mean, why would you dream about him? He doesn\u2019t even know you? Or he didn\u2019t even know you. And...this whole thing is just crazy.\u201d</p><p>Katherine cut her off, \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I promise you that the guy in this picture with you right here is the guy I\u2019ve been dreaming about.\u201d</p><p>Taylor breathed in deeply and slowly exhaled, \u201cI believe you. But I\u2019m a little weirded out right now. It\u2019s a lot to take in and I just don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Taylor looked away and stared at the wall.</p><p>\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I hate you? Stop it.\u201d Taylor fell silent. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to make sense out of something that makes no sense at all.\u201d</p><p>Katherine knew she couldn\u2019t do anything but wait for the shock and disbelief to wear off. But what if it never did? What if Taylor was weirded out forever? She didn\u2019t realize it yet, but amid all of her confusion, there was a small spark of happiness.</p><p>She finally knew his name.</p><p>They sat in silence for a long time. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand,\u201d Taylor grabbed at her head. \u201cMy head hurts. My heart hurts. My brain hurts,\u201d she rubbed her temples. \u201cI think we should just call it a night. Maybe if you see my brother you can ask him just what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Taylor. I feel like this is all my fault.\u201d Katherine didn\u2019t want to cause Taylor pain.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything, Kat. Let\u2019s just go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Katherine did her best to think of the beach and the bench as she drifted off to sleep. She saw Austen\u2019s shadow in the distance. She stayed on the bench and watched as the shadow grew closer. Brody bounced up to her and wagged his tail. She planted kisses on the top of his nose. She heard Austen\u2019s footsteps as he approached, but she was too nervous to look.</p><p>\u201cI should have told you,\u201d he sat down next to her.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you do that to me? To Taylor?\u201d One look into those eyes and she knew she couldn\u2019t stay mad at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry. Let me try to explain.\u201d He took her hands in his and looked deeply into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d It was pointless to try to fight his requests. Everything about him compelled her.</p><p>\u201cObviously, I watch over my family. I keep an eye out for them. I wasn\u2019t ready to leave when I died, but I had no choice. I went to visit Taylor and I saw you there. I couldn\u2019t believe it was you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recognized you instantly. All of our lives flashed inside my mind in a split second. I felt a pull so strongly toward you that I almost couldn\u2019t stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Lives? What do you mean our lives?\u201d She searched for answers as to why he called to her with such intensity.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve lived many other lifetimes together, Katherine. Think about it.\u201d He urged her to explore a concept that her mind could barely wrap itself around.</p><p>\u201cOther lifetimes? You mean, like reincarnation? Past lives and stuff?\u201d She wanted to understand what he meant, so she listened to every word he spoke as if she\u2019d never get the chance to hear it again.</p><p>\u201cExactly. If you really think about it, it makes perfect sense. Why our feelings are so intense. How we\u2019re drawn to each other in ways we can\u2019t explain. Why we know certain things about one other without them being said. Our souls are connected,\u201d he tried to explain.</p><p>\u201cI want you to understand all of this, but I know I\u2019m probably only confusing you,\u201d he added with a hint of desperation in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never really thought about it before,\u201d Katherine admitted. \u201cPast lives I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore this life\u2014the one we\u2019re living right now, there was a different life. It was years ago and in another state, but we were together. And before that life, there was a previous one. You and I have spent many of our lifetimes together, Katherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201dWhen you say it like that, it makes sense. Like, it feels logical to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Austen\u2019s face brightened.</p><p>\u201cWell if we lived other lifetimes together, then our souls would recognize each other, right? I mean, even if our minds didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Austen smiled, \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why I feel the way I do when I\u2019m around you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>\u201cI feel things I\u2019ve never felt before. I can\u2019t even put the emotions into words because I don\u2019t know how. It\u2019s like you call to me. But it\u2019s deeper than that. I don\u2019t know how to explain it,\u201d Katherine struggled.</p><p>\u201cI understand completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Katherine, I tried to fight the urge to communicate with you, but it was pointless. I wasn\u2019t strong enough to stay away. The moment I saw you, I was drawn to you like a magnet. We\u2019re not supposed to interfere like that. You know? It\u2019s really not allowed,\u201d Austen informed her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean, not allowed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re allowed to communicate with our loved ones.

What I mean is, I\u2019m not supposed to put you in a position where you will want to live in the past, and not move forward. I\u2019m not making any sense, am I?\u201d Austen tugged at his hair. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain this to you. It\u2019s different once you\u2019re here...on the soul level. Things are clearer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I understand,\u201d Katherine nodded, but her eyes were still clouded with confusion.</p><p>\u201cKatherine, when I saw you...I almost lost my breath. I tried to tell myself to turn around and walk out of that room, but I couldn\u2019t.\u201d Austen paused for a moment and looked into her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI just wanted to be near you. My heart felt like it was about to explode inside my chest, it was filled with so much love at just seeing your face. So I told myself that I\u2019d try to reach you one time. I\u2019d try to see if I could get into your dreams that night. I didn\u2019t know if it would even work. But I got into your mind so easily at first.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit up.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d remember the dream,\u201d Austen continued. \u201cBut you did. When I saw how affected you were by it\u2014how you could sense me around you even after you were awake\u2014it was almost too much for me. When I saw that you couldn\u2019t let the idea of me go, I couldn\u2019t either. It would be like asking the waves to stop crashing onto the shore. The water is pulled toward the sandy shoreline in the same way I\u2019m pulled toward you. You are my shore.\u201d He touched her face and her stomach flipped.</p><p>For once since the craziness started, she began to understand. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I remember?\u201d She clarified, \u201cOur other lives, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that while you\u2019re still living. Otherwise, we\u2019d all be too wrapped up in the memories of the past to live in the present. That\u2019s what I meant about messing up your path.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember everything. I can see all we\u2019ve shared even though you can\u2019t. How could anyone, living or otherwise, expect me to stay away from you with that knowledge? I\u2019m not that strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I tell Taylor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind her that I had no self-control for the things I loved when I was alive, and tell her I\u2019m still the same way. She\u2019ll get a kick out of that.\u201d He laughed and it made Katherine smile.</p><p>She heard what he said about love, and couldn\u2019t resist the urge to ask, \u201cYou love me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how not to.\u201d He kissed her and she struggled to breathe.</p> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Katherine opened her eyes and looked over at Taylor, who was still sleeping. She sat in bed and replayed everything Austen had just told her.</p><p>\u201cSo did you see him last night?\u201d Taylor\u2019s voice interrupted her retrospection.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Katherine only wanted to give Taylor information if she asked for it. She didn\u2019t want to confuse or hurt her any more than was necessary.</p><p>\u201cWell? Did he say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted me to tell you he was sorry for all of this and that you know he doesn\u2019t have any self-control when it comes to the things he loves.\u201d</p><p>Taylor smiled through her falling tears. \u201cWhat did he mean by that?\u201d Katherine asked her.</p><p>\u201cWhen Austen loved something he had to have it. He fell in love with this puppy one day walking past the grocery store and even though we couldn\u2019t afford to have a dog, Austen got him anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrody?\u201d Katherine wondered.</p><p>\u201cYeah? How\u2019d you...oh wait, is Brody there too?\u201d Taylor\u2019s eyes opened widely.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s usually with your brother. I love that dog,\u201d Katherine smiled.</p><p>\u201cWell that makes me happy. You know, that they\u2019re together. Brody died right after Austen did and I always hoped they had each other.\u201d</p><p>Katherine nodded and smiled softly.</p><p>\u201cSo anyway, he had to have the dog. But he paid for everything himself. And he had to make the varsity wrestling team, even though they said he\u2019d never make weight. And when he decided that he liked Kylie, he had to have her too.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s face dropped...followed closely by her stomach. \u201cEven though she was dating someone else at the time. He just wanted what he wanted. Not in a selfish, screw you, kind of way. It\u2019s just that Austen always felt things deeper than other people. He didn\u2019t see the sense in letting the things he wanted get away from him. You know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAusten and Kylie?\u201d Katherine choked on the words. She grabbed at her stomach and tightly closed her eyes. \u201cNo wonder there\u2019s always been that weirdness between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d Taylor sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cI had no idea. I mean, I never even thought about it, but of course he would have had a girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s how I met Kylie. She bugged me a lot at first. But after Austen died, we got really close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere there any other girls?\u201d Katherine needed to be mentally prepared in case they ran into any of Austen\u2019s exes while they were in town.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was just Kylie. They dated for almost two years, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they together when he had his accident?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They had already broken up. But it hadn\u2019t been long. Kylie was an absolute wreck,\u201d Taylor shuddered.</p><p>Jealousy consumed Katherine\u2019s body and mind. She was so envious that Kylie got to kiss Austen, hold his hand and be loved by him. Thoughts of them together made Katherine want to throw up. No matter how hard she tried to rid the made up images of Kylie and Austen from her imagination, they refused to leave. She was thankful when her cell phone beeped, quickly followed by Taylor\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cText from Cooper,\u201d Katherine said out loud.</p><p>\u201cKylie,\u201d Taylor commented. \u201cWhat did Cooper say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope you\u2019re having a great time at Tay\u2019s. I miss you and can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d Katherine placed the phone at her side.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to text him back?\u201d Taylor asked as she typed out a response to Kylie.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t right now. I don\u2019t even know what to say without feeling like I\u2019m lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Just write back and tell him you miss him too and you\u2019ll talk to him later. Simple as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I miss him or not. I don\u2019t want to write something I don\u2019t mean,\u201d Katherine buried her head into her hands.</p><p>\u201cOf course you miss him, Kat. Your emotions are just all over the place right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d she admitted. \u201cSo, what did Kylie say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows we\u2019re in town and she wants to stop by. I can\u2019t tell her \u2018no.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Are we telling her? She knows about the dream guy, remember? What if she asks?\u201d Katherine didn\u2019t want to see Kylie, but knew it was unavoidable.</p><p>\u201cHopefully she won\u2019t even remember. But Kat, she never got over my brother so I don\u2019t think telling her this stuff would be a good idea,\u201d Taylor warned. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how she\u2019d react and I think it would hurt her more than anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that.\u201d Even though it pained Katherine to think about Austen and Kylie together, she didn\u2019t want to hurt her.</p><p>Taylor looked over at Katherine and said, \u201cI want you to know that I really loved my brother, Katherine. He was a great guy and I honestly wish you two could have met. You would have loved him.\u201d</p><p>Taylor stifled a small laugh before she continued, \u201cHe was my best friend. It was the worst thing in my world to lose him. I just want you to know that it gives me comfort to know that he\u2019s still around.\u201d</p><p>Taylor\u2019s words made Katherine smile. \u201cThank you so much. I\u2019ve been so worried you wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I do, but I\u2019m too hungry to try to figure it out right now,\u201d Taylor rubbed her belly. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything to my family, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, Taylor, I would never. But hey, are we okay? I mean, me and you?\u201d Katherine wanted to make sure that Taylor wasn\u2019t holding anything back.</p><p>Taylor walked over to Katherine and gave her a hug before she said, \u201cThis is really weird and it\u2019s a lot to take in. I know that maybe I should be more weirded out, right? Like maybe I should be completely freaking out or something? But I honestly just don\u2019t feel that way. The truth is, for whatever reason, I\u2019m kind of happy my brother talks to you.\u201d</p><p>Katherine let out a huge sigh of relief as her shoulders relaxed, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The girls smiled at each other with watery eyes. Katherine took one last glance at the picture of Taylor and Austen on the beach and headed out of the bedroom.</p><p>The girls showered and ate. They made small talk with Taylor\u2019s parents before they walked outside to feed the horses. Taylor showed Katherine how much food to give them and how to attach the buckets to the stall. She did some light cleaning in the barn and stopped by the poker room to give her brother a hug.</p><p>\u201cGod, Matty, don\u2019t you ever go home?\u201d Taylor teased him.</p><p>\u201cI only go home when you\u2019re not around. Where\u2019s my hug?\u201d Matty stood up with open arms and Taylor leaped into them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d treat you like crap if I didn\u2019t love you so much.\u201d Taylor planted a big wet kiss on his cheek and Matty pretended to faint while he clutched at his chest.</p><p>\u201cI know you have some new hockey stud boyfriend, but he\u2019s got nothing on me. One day, Taylor Dailey, you\u2019ll be mine and you know it.\u201d She lifted her eyebrows and gave him a smirk before she walked out.</p><p>\u201cIt is so funny how much that kid loves you,\u201d Katherine said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI know. He always has. Not for nothing, but isn\u2019t he adorable? Those dimples...oh, they kill me every time!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God! You totally love him! You\u2019re going to ditch Danny and start dating a high school boy,\u201d Katherine teased, and poked Taylor in the arm.</p><p>\u201cWell at least he\u2019s alive.\u201d The moment the words escaped Taylor\u2019s mouth, Katherine\u2019s face dropped and her legs stopped moving. \u201cOh my God, Katherine, I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>Katherine looked at her with hurt in her eyes. She wondered how Taylor could even think something so cruel, let alone say it out loud. But then logic seeped in and Katherine begrudgingly admitted, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I mean, you\u2019re right. That just hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I don\u2019t know what got into me. He\u2019s my brother...I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t have said what?\u201d Kylie\u2019s snarky tone congested the air.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kyles! Nothing, we were just talking about Blake and Matty.\u201d Taylor shot Katherine a look and then gave Kylie a quick squeeze.</p><p>Katherine hesitated and then did the same, \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jealousy permeated throughout Katherine\u2019s body as she tried her best to be polite and kind. Her stomach flipped and twisted as she fought off the urge to ask Kylie everything she knew about Austen. She wanted to know what it was like to date him. How it felt to be loved by him. How he treated her. Was he funny? Did he make her laugh? There were parts of her that wanted every tasty morsel of information she could consume.</p><p>The three meandered toward the overstuffed patio furniture and sat down. \u201cSo girls, what\u2019s been going on? Fill me in on everything.\u201d Kylie eyed Katherine, \u201cYou still dating that super-hot guy? What was his name? Colton? Colby? Something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper,\u201d Katherine snickered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Cooper. So you two still together or what?\u201d Kylie feigned interest.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re still together,\u201d Katherine\u2019s tone hitched.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Trouble in paradise?\u201d Kylie\u2019s asked smugly.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just complicated is all,\u201d Taylor shot a look of death at Katherine and kicked her swiftly under the table.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine, Kylie. Katherine\u2019s just a mental case because her boyfriend is royalty.\u201d Taylor attempted to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cMaybe he should be dating a girl who can handle that sort of thing,\u201d Kylie arched her brows. \u201cI\u2019ll take him off your hands, Kat, if he\u2019s too much for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind, thanks.\u201d Katherine knew Kylie wasn\u2019t entirely joking.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Tay?\u201d Kylie turned to look at her. She forced a sweet smile before she asked, \u201cEverything good with Danny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo complaints,\u201d Taylor glared.</p><p>\u201cOh Taylor, tell her what Danny did.\u201d Katherine longed to shift the focus of Kylie\u2019s questions away from herself.</p><p>Taylor\u2019s face instantly turned two shades pinker. \u201cWell, my crazy boyfriend told me he loved me for the first time ever. Not only did he tell me loved me, but he screamed it...out loud...in a parking lot filled with people!\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s mouth fell open as Taylor continued, \u201cI was so embarrassed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would be horrified if any guy ever did that to me,\u201d Kylie snapped in disapproval.</p><p>\u201cYou know what though? It was sweet. And romantic,\u201d Taylor grinned, \u201cSo what about you, Kylie? Any guys in your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you know, the usual. I meet a lot of guys at work, but I can\u2019t get the ones I don\u2019t want anymore to go away.\u201d She rolled her eyes and then breathed in quickly, \u201cThat\u2019s what I was going to ask you. I almost forgot. What ever happened to that dream guy? Did he ever come back?\u201d</p><p>Katherine almost threw up and Taylor\u2019s face turned white, \u201cNope. He\u2019s just gone,\u201d Taylor tried to convince her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Kylie called her on it. \u201cI might have believed you if her face didn\u2019t give it away.\u201d She glared at Kat with disgust.</p><p>\u201cNo, really,\u201d Kat shook her head, \u201che hasn\u2019t come back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know you that well and I know you\u2019re completely full of it.\u201d</p><p>Katherine glanced at Taylor for approval and she softly nodded her head.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. He\u2019s been back. A few times,\u201d Katherine admitted.</p><p>\u201cReally? And it\u2019s the same guy every time?\u201d Kylie asked, intrigued.</p><p>\u201cYep, same guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know who he is yet? I mean, is he real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Katherine attempted to lie again.</p><p>Kylie squinted, \u201cYou\u2019re a terrible liar, Kat.\u201d Kylie\u2019s eyes darted between the two girls. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>Taylor rubbed at her eyes and then stared at Kylie. \u201cJust keep an open mind, okay?\u201d</p><p>Kylie responded with attitude. \u201cWhatever. What is it?\u201d</p><p>Katherine was so scared for Kylie\u2019s reaction that she stood up and started to pace back and forth. She assumed Kylie would be incredibly angry, would most likely hate her and probably want to fight her. Kat wasn\u2019t a fighter, so she hoped it didn\u2019t come to that.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you pacing? Sit down.\u201d Kylie barked at Kat. \u201cWhich one of you is going to tell me what the hell is going on?\u201d She folded her arms across her chest and tapped her foot against the deck.</p><p>Katherine shook her head \u2018no\u2019 and watched as Taylor took a deep breath. \u201cWe figured out who Kat\u2019s dream guy is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gathered that much.\u201d Kylie grumbled, \u201cSo, why all the drama? Who is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAusten,\u201d was all Taylor said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what did you just say?\u201d Kylie asked through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Austen, Kyles. He\u2019s the one from her dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you joking? This is a joke right?\u201d Kylie glowered at Katherine and screamed, \u201cHe didn\u2019t even know you! Why the hell would you dream about my boyfriend?\u201d Her face reddened as she continued to yell, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Katherine added. \u201cKylie, please calm down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Kylie whipped her head and narrowed her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me. I don\u2019t want to hear anything you have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKylie, don\u2019t be like that. It\u2019s not her fault. She had no idea who he was until last night,\u201d Taylor explained.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened last night? How do you even know it\u2019s him? How do you know she\u2019s not lying, Taylor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe recognized him from a picture in my bedroom. And why would she lie about this?\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s face twisted in anguish as she wailed, \u201cHe was my boyfriend. Not yours! He didn\u2019t love you, he didn\u2019t even know you!\u201d Her eyes tightened with confusion. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he come to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Katherine avoided eye contact.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying! You do know! Tell me!\u201d Kylie shouted. Talking about Austen like this was too much for her. The pain was too real and the emotions were still raw. To have him come up this way was like ripping a blood-soaked bandage off a two-year-old wound to find it had barely begun to heal.</p><p>Kylie buried her face in her hands and started to cry tears of disbelief and sadness. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t he come to me? Doesn\u2019t he love me any more?\u201d Kylie was inconsolable. \u201dWhy did he stop loving me? I haven\u2019t stopped loving him.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s heart ached inside her chest. She had never in her life inflicted so much pain on another. She felt completely responsible. She wanted to fix it, but she didn\u2019t know how.</p><p>\u201cOf course he loves you, Kyles.\u201d Taylor reached her arms around and hugged her from behind. \u201cYou were the only girl he ever loved.\u201d She peered into Katherine\u2019s eyes as she spoke those words.</p><p>Katherine whispered, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Kylie. I never meant to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Kylie scowled at Kat through her tear-stained face, \u201cI don\u2019t care that you\u2019re sorry. Stay away from me, and stay away from Austen!\u201d She threw Taylor\u2019s arms off of her shoulders and sprinted toward her car.</p><p>\u201cKylie, don\u2019t go. Come on,\u201d Taylor bellowed.</p><p>Once Kylie reached her car, she slammed the door, blasted the stereo and sped away, spinning the tires until they screeched. Taylor gave Katherine a sad look. \u201cWell, that went well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry, Taylor. I can\u2019t believe all of this is happening.\u201d Katherine wasn\u2019t sorry for meeting Austen. She wasn\u2019t sorry for the dreams. But she was sorry for all the pain it seemed to cause those around her.</p><p>\u201cShe just needs time. It\u2019s a lot to take in, you know?\u201d she met Kat\u2019s sympathizing gaze. \u201cShe really loved my brother and I can only imagine that she probably feels left out, or forgotten, or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just feel terrible that something that makes me so happy makes everyone else so upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone,\u201d Taylor grinned and Katherine hugged her.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cWas that Kylie who sped out of here this morning?\u201d Taylor\u2019s mom asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cYeah. She stopped by, got pissy, and left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Her mom stopped washing the dishes and peered at the girls.</p><p>\u201cNothing happened. You know how Kylie is, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Dailey went back to washing and nodded her head. \u201cShe is emotional. Well, I hope you girls patch things up before you head back to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we will.\u201d</p><p>The girls flopped onto Taylor\u2019s bed and Katherine rested her head against the pillow.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll call you back?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Taylor hesitated, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know. It might be awhile before she\u2019s ready to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from Danny?\u201d Katherine wanted to think about something happy and Taylor and Danny always made her smile.</p><p>\u201cOnly every twenty minutes,\u201d Taylor joked, and shook her cell phone. \u201cDid you ever respond to Cooper\u2019s text?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him I was having a great time. I hoped he was too and that I\u2019d see him in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm, what?\u201d Katherine asked.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell him you missed him back,\u201d Taylor noted.</p><p>\u201cI must have forgotten,\u201d Katherine smirked.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Listen, now that your dream guy is my brother it sort of changes things. I mean, I feel invested, or something. But I still don\u2019t want you to blow Cooper off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make any promises,\u201d Katherine admitted.</p><p>\u201cSo then what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Kat wondered.</p><p>\u201cAbout Cooper. Are you going to tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so; at least, not yet. I don\u2019t see any reason why I should, in all honesty.\u201d She focused her eyes on Taylor.</p><p>Taylor nodded and said, \u201cNo, you\u2019re right. But some day, when you do tell him, I\u2019d love to be a fly on the wall for that conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you think that will be? I mean really? When am I going to have to tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll know. I don\u2019t think there will be any other option. Know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Katherine pursed her lips together, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p><p>Taylor yawned before she said, \u201cGoodnight, Kat. Tell my brother \u2018hi\u2019 for me.\u201d And then she rolled over and closed her eyes.</p><p>The comment made Katherine laugh. \u201cNight, Tay.\u201d</p><p>Katherine walked along the warm grains of sand and kicked at it with her bare feet. She could see their bench in the distance. She saw him even further in the distance. She smiled just knowing he was near. She watched as Austen tossed a stick for Brody to chase.</p><p>When they could see each other\u2019s faces, their eyes lit up. Austen walked up to her and put his hand on the back of her neck. He bent down slightly and kissed her. It was soft and slow and she hoped he\u2019d never stop. Her mind raced. Her body felt like it might melt through his arms. He pulled away from her and said, \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She blushed and ran her fingers across her wet lips. He took her other hand and led her over to their bench. They sat down before he asked, \u201cRough day, huh?\u201d</p><p>She jogged through her memory to recall what he referred too, but she couldn\u2019t place it. Bits and pieces scattered in her mind, but they weren\u2019t enough. She struggled to remember when Austen pressed her. \u201cThink, Katherine. Remember your conversations today with my sister...and with Kylie.\u201d</p><p>The moment Austen said Kylie\u2019s name, it hit her with the force of a Mack truck. Her face twisted and her eyes filled with water. \u201cYou remember now, don\u2019t you?\u201d He gently wiped the falling tears from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh, Austen, it was awful. I feel so bad...hurting her like that.\u201d Kat tumbled into Austen\u2019s chest.</p> <p>\u201cI know; I feel bad too. I never want to hurt Kylie. I know that my dying was hard on her. I used to visit her at first. Mostly because I was confused and wasn\u2019t sure where I was, so I went to where I was pulled. Her pain and longing for me was stronger than almost anything else I felt at the time. I found myself in her dreams often.\u201d Austen paused and ran his fingers through her long brown hair.</p><p>\u201cOnce I realized what happened and I had more control over where I could go and what I could do, I stopped visiting her. I felt like being with her wasn\u2019t good for her. She could barely carry on as it was, and the dreams weren\u2019t helping,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Katherine listened to every word he spoke about his first love. It was difficult for her to imagine him loving anyone else. \u201cYou guys really loved each other didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did. I don\u2019t want to diminish what Kylie and I shared because it was love. Ridiculous, high school, teenage love...but still\u2014love.\u201d He lifted her chin to face him. \u201cBut it\u2019s nothing like how I feel about you.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips against hers and softly parted them with his tongue. She saw flashes of places, people, things she didn\u2019t recognize. His kisses awoke her otherwise dormant subconscious. He made every part of her feel alive. \u201cI love you beyond the depths of my soul.\u201d His words sent shivers down her spine as she nodded her head in agreement.</p> <p>\u201cI want to take you somewhere. But it\u2019s not going to be easy,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to show you something. Will you come with me?\u201d His voice was darker now and she started to get nervous. What did he want to show her? Where did he want to take her?</p><p>She reached for his outstretched hand and before she even blinked, they were walking down a darkened street. Katherine heard screams and cries in the distance. And smoke...the smoke choked out the air. Her eyes worked to focus on the scene in front of her. Twisted metal wrapped around more metal. She tried to make out what she was witnessing, but she needed to get closer. Austen reached out his arm to stop her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve watched this probably a hundred times. Nothing ever changes,\u201d he said solemnly.</p><p>Katherine looked on, horrified. A small passenger car sat smashed beyond recognition underneath an unscathed big rig truck. Smoke from the airbags flooded out of the shattered car windows. The big rig driver paced back and forth nervously; completely freaked out. He had trouble breathing and frequently slammed his fist against his chest. Police cars and ambulances finally arrived on scene, their sirens blaring into the otherwise quiet night. They yelled frantically as they directed heavy equipment toward the crushed car. The earsplitting sound of power tools grinding against metal screamed into the air.</p> <p>They finally pulled out two limp and lifeless bodies from the battered car. Katherine recognized Austen\u2019s frame immediately. She dropped to the ground and tore at her shirt. She started to cry and scream, but no one could hear her. When she felt a warm hand on her shoulder, she suddenly remembered that he was still right there with her. She turned and forcefully pulled him to the ground with her. She glanced back at the heartbreaking scene in time to see the two bodies covered in sheets, being wheeled into the ambulance. Katherine could barely stomach this reality as her insides churned.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you show me this?\u201d she asked through her sobs.</p><p>\u201cMy death is a big part of how people remember me. They\u2019ve stopped seeing all the other moments. Instead, they focus on the one that took me from them. They think about the road I was killed on, or the truck we smashed into, or where they were when they heard the news. It\u2019s like they have to get past the part where I died before they can get to the parts where I lived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you showed me this so that I\u2019d think of your death too? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to see where I spent my last minutes. This accident is a part of me. For you to truly understand how everyone who ever loved me in this life feels, I had to show it to you. Not to make you sad, just to help you see.\u201d</p><p>He intertwined his fingers with hers and they were suddenly in a very crowded church parking lot. Katherine had never seen so many people vie to be in one space before. Austen and Katherine waded through the crowd and into the building. There were flowers everywhere and a large picture of Austen greeted everyone inside the church.</p><p>Katherine looked around and found Taylor as she wiped her eyes in the front row. She watched as Taylor\u2019s mother and father held on to each other while they sobbed. Blake sat next to Taylor, and looked as if every emotion that had ever lived inside his body had vacated for the day. While everyone around him fell apart, Blake looked as though he refused to do the same.</p><p>Then Katherine heard cries and screams that were filled with so much agony, they made her tremble. She looked around and noticed Kylie being held by her mother. She was in so much pain and Katherine\u2019s heart hurt for her. The overwhelming amount of sadness in the room almost broke her.</p> <p>Austen reminded her, \u201cDon\u2019t be sad.\u201d</p><p>Heartbreak flowed through her. \u201cPoor Kylie,\u201d was all Katherine could get out before she was overcome with emotion.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s hard to see her like that.\u201d Austen turned away from her. Katherine noticed him cringe each time Kylie screamed out. He kissed the top of her head and took her hand again, \u201cOne last stop.\u201d</p><p>They walked on the grass toward a row of headstones. The lawn was meticulously manicured and each gravesite was filled with trinkets and flowers. Even though it was supposed to be a place filled with death, it felt more like a place filled with love.</p><p>Austen pulled her toward a light gray stone. She could read his name now. Austen Dailey, beloved son, brother, and friend. The front of his site was filled with little white rocks. There were all sorts of figurines, stuffed animals, and toys. There was a picture of him on the stone and Katherine bent down to get a better look at it.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. I\u2019m way better looking in person,\u201d he radiated. She tried to smile, but she was too caught up in everything she had just witnessed. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring you here to make you sad. I didn\u2019t show you any of this to make you upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she reassured him.</p><p>\u201cThen what is it? Tell me.\u201d He sat down on the grass in front of his stone and pulled her down toward him. She sat between his legs and he wrapped his arms around her. She swore she felt his heart beat. He kissed the side of her face as her tears fell onto his lips. \u201cPlease don\u2019t cry, Katherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to. It\u2019s just that...I can\u2019t imagine how Kylie must have felt to lose you like that. Or Taylor...or your parents. It just breaks my heart for them...and for whatever reason, for me.\u201d</p><p>She felt his warm breath against her neck as he whispered softly into her ear, \u201cI don\u2019t have to be living in your world to love you. I\u2019m sorry to have caused you pain.\u201d He brushed against her cheek with his lips before he kissed the nape of her neck. She closed her eyes and got lost in how he made every fiber of her being feel warm and alive. \u201cI love you,\u201d he told her, \u201cbeyond all reason.\u201d</p><p>Katherine woke up and gasped for air. Taylor sat up immediately and stared at her, \u201cWhat did my brother do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took me to the scene of his accident,\u201d Katherine choked out the words.</p><p>\u201cHe did what? Way to go Austen. You really know how to romance a girl.\u201d Taylor shouted up at her ceiling and waved her hands around.</p><p>\u201cHe also showed me his funeral and his gravesite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Taylor rolled her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019d he do that for? Is he trying to depress you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he just wanted me to see. I think if I saw how painful it was for everyone who loved him, I might understand it better? I\u2019m not entirely sure.\u201d</p><p>Taylor shook her head, \u201cUnderstand what better? And how the heck would seeing any of that make you feel anything other than sad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that does remind me. I need to go to the gravesite and bring Aus flowers. Did you maybe want to come with or does that freak you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that doesn\u2019t freak me out at all. I\u2019d love to go, actually,\u201d Katherine wanted to see it. She wondered if it would be anything like her dream.</p><p>The girls got dressed, ate cereal, and headed out. Taylor\u2019s dad asked where they were going and once Taylor told him the location, he put his head down and smiled. Katherine gathered that Austen was a topic of conversation that didn\u2019t come up often. She completely understood, but it still made her sad. They stopped to get some white calla lilies and then Taylor drove into the cemetery and parked next to Austen\u2019s grave.</p><p>It was exactly like Katherine had seen in her dream. There were angel figurines and notes in plastic bags. Taylor placed the lilies on the top of his headstone and leaned in to kiss the picture of Austen\u2019s face. She talked softly to him and said things Katherine couldn\u2019t hear. When Taylor had moved away, Katherine picked up a couple of the small white rocks from the base of his stone and held them in her palm. Warm sparks shot through her fingers.</p><p>\u201cTaylor, would it be weird if I kept a couple of these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot any weirder than you already are.\u201d</p><p>Katherine settled the two small rocks into the coin part of her wallet. \u201cSo that you\u2019re always with me, wherever I go,\u201d she murmured under her breath.</p><p>She sound of tires crunching against gravel forced Katherine to look toward the cemetery entrance. \u201cTaylor, is that Kylie\u2019s car?\u201d</p><p>Taylor looked over her shoulder. \u201cSure is. This ought to be fun,\u201d she inhaled deeply.</p><p>Kylie parked her car behind Taylor\u2019s and opened her door slowly. She took a few steps before she spotted Katherine and abruptly stopped. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me. Why is she here?\u201d</p><p>Katherine stood up and pleaded, \u201cKylie, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t...talk to me. I already told you that. God, are you stupid?\u201d Kylie turned around and walked back toward her car.</p><p>Katherine\u2019s mind flashed to the image of Kylie the day of Austen\u2019s funeral. She flinched as she remembered the sound of Kylie\u2019s anguished wails. \u201cHe loved you so much.\u201d</p><p>Kylie stopped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh jeez, Kat. Don\u2019t do this,\u201d Taylor begged.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to me?\u201d Kylie asked furiously.</p><p>\u201cHe told me how much he truly loved you,\u201d Katherine chose her words carefully.</p><p>\u201cShut up! I do not want to hear that you are talking to him. I don\u2019t want to hear anything about Austen from your mouth. Do you understand that?\u201d she hurried into her car. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go back to California and leave us all alone?\u201d Kylie slammed her door closed and tore away.</p> <p>Katherine sat back down, dejected. She faced Taylor and confessed, \u201cI was only trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Taylor acknowledged. \u201cI just don\u2019t think you should talk about my brother to Kylie. Put yourself in her shoes. How would you feel?\u201d</p><p>It was as if a switch flipped in Katherine\u2019s head and her eyes lit up. \u201cI think that\u2019s what your brother was trying to show me last night. I think he wanted me to understand Kylie\u2019s pain. He needed me to really see how she felt about him to truly understand.\u201d</p><p>Katherine slapped her palm against her forehead, \u201cGod, I\u2019m such an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t beat yourself up,\u201d Taylor helped pull Katherine to her feet. \u201cWe should probably get going.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for your hospitality. It was really nice to be here,\u201d Katherine squeezed Taylor\u2019s mom.</p><p>\u201cIt was nice to have you. Come back soon, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will,\u201d Katherine promised and turned to Blake, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to come visit us soon. We\u2019ll have so much fun.\u201d</p><p>Blake blushed and responded quietly, \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Katherine walked out the front door and toward Taylor\u2019s waiting car. She was excited to get back to school, but a little hesitant to see Cooper.</p> <p>\u201cAre you nervous to see Cooper?\u201d Taylor asked her from the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cA little. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to feel when I see him, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But you still like him, right?\u201d Taylor checked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. He\u2019s perfect. But...it\u2019s just not the same as the way I feel about your brother.\u201d</p><p>Katherine realized that rationally, she should be head over heels in love with Cooper Donovan. But love wasn\u2019t always rational. And the bond between her and Austen had nothing to do with logic...or ration. It wouldn\u2019t be easy to walk away from him and into Cooper\u2019s arms, even though she assumed it probably should be.</p><p>\u201cRight. My brother...the guy who isn\u2019t alive,\u201d Taylor forced the words out.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s crazy. But the way I feel when I\u2019m with your brother is unlike anything I\u2019ve ever known. I can\u2019t explain to you how deep my emotions run. I don\u2019t know how.\u201d She struggled to find the right words, but nothing sounded perfect enough.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t give up on Cooper, okay? He deserves more from you than that,\u201d Taylor insisted. \u201cPlus, if you let him go, do you know how many stupid girls you\u2019d make happy? They\u2019re too annoying to be that happy.\u201d</p> <p>Katherine laughed, \u201cI\u2019d completely forgotten about all those girls. Listen, I care about Cooper a lot. I just need to see how I feel when I see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, here\u2019s your chance.\u201d Taylor pulled her car into the parking lot and noticed Danny immediately. \u201cThere they are.\u201d</p><p>The dozen red roses he held stood out more than he did in his ripped jeans and tight black t-shirt. Cooper stood next to him in jeans and a dark blue shirt, holding three sunflowers.</p><p>Katherine felt chills course through her as her heart raced. She rubbed at the goose bumps on her arms. She was definitely still attracted to him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting sweaty,\u201d Katherine admitted to Taylor, who laughed in relief.</p><p>\u201cThank goodness for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, at least you still like the guy.\u201d</p><p>Danny ran to the Taylor\u2019s side of the car and opened the door. She hopped out and leapt into his arms. \u201cFor me?\u201d she gestured toward the roses.</p><p>\u201cI missed you so much.\u201d Danny handed them to her and proceeded to plant kisses all over her face. Taylor struggled to push him away, but he only tightened his grip.</p><p>\u201cI just got back...ugh, don\u2019t annoy me already!\u201d she joked.</p><p>\u201cYou love it. You love me, remember?\u201d Danny teased.</p><p>\u201cI can take that back,\u201d she shot back at him playfully.</p><p>\u201cNope. No take-backs.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s heart pounded a million miles a minute as she watched Cooper head toward her. \u201cI missed you too. A lot,\u201d his voice smoothly informed her. She smiled, but didn\u2019t respond as he handed her the sunflowers.</p><p>She grabbed them as Cooper wrapped his arms around her and pulled her close. He leaned in and his lips pressed against hers. She heard him softly sigh as his tongue slowly found its way inside her mouth. She threw her arms around his neck and kissed him back, but a part of her that felt like she was being unfaithful to Austen. She knew it sounded crazy, but she couldn\u2019t help it. Was this cheating?</p><p>Cooper sensed her hesitation and pulled away. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d his voice shook with vulnerability.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just really tired. Thank you so much for my flowers. That was really sweet of you. And sunflowers are my favorite! How\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. The moment I saw them in the store, I thought of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have good intuition, Mr. Donovan.\u201d She was surprised at how easy it was to fall back into him. There was a level of comfort between them that she genuinely appreciated. It would be so easy to give her whole heart to him, if she had it to give.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good time at Taylor\u2019s?\u201d he longed to extend their interaction.</p><p>\u201cTotally. Her family is so great. It was really nice. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of hockey, lots of family, and lots of food. The perfect way to spend any break,\u201d he smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty. I missed your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed your eye,\u201d she ran her thumb down the side of his face.</p><p>In moments like these, Katherine wished everything could be far less complicated. But she knew for that to happen, it would come at a price she wasn\u2019t willing to pay. Giving up Austen for Cooper wasn\u2019t something she wanted to do. Honestly, it wasn\u2019t something she thought she was capable of doing.</p><p>\u201cI feel like you\u2019re a million miles away, California,\u201d he sensed the change in her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Coop. I really am tired.\u201d</p><p>He pretended to believe her.</p><p>She almost blurted it all out\u2014how she dreamed about Taylor\u2019s dead brother. She wanted to be honest with Cooper, but feared that she couldn\u2019t. Not while the revelations were still so new. She figured he\u2019d ask a million questions that she wouldn\u2019t have the answers to and that wouldn\u2019t be fair to him.</p><p>She contemplated her situation. She could do this. She\u2019d see Austen at night when she slept, and be a normal girl during the day like everyone else. She almost laughed out loud at the thought. Nothing about this situation was normal and she questioned if anything about her was? Surely this sort of thing didn\u2019t happen to normal people.</p><p>Cooper broke the silence, \u201cDo you want to get some dinner after practice later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight. I have a paper I need to start writing and I\u2019m probably going to crash early. Maybe tomorrow?\u201d It wasn\u2019t a complete lie. She did have a paper to write and the week at Taylor\u2019s had been emotionally exhausting. But she also really wanted to see Austen again and the only way she could do that was if she was asleep.</p><p>\u201cAll right then. Tomorrow. I\u2019m holding you to it.\u201d He bit his bottom lip the way she loved and leaned in to kiss her goodbye. \u201cI\u2019ll remind you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me...about what?\u201d she questioned with half a smile.</p><p>\u201cHow incredible it is to be with me...cause you\u2019ve obviously forgotten,\u201d he smiled at her, his confidence radiating off his body.</p><p>She laughed, \u201cThanks again for the flowers.\u201d</p><p>She watched as Cooper walked toward Danny, grabbed him by the sleeve and practically dragged him away from Taylor while she laughed.</p><p>\u201cI love her,\u201d Danny smirked.</p><p>\u201cWe know. The whole school knows genius,\u201d Cooper teased.</p><p>\u201cHow was Katherine?\u201d</p><p>Cooper squirmed and his eyes narrowed, \u201cShe was weird. Something was off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Danny wondered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. She\u2019s just different. I hate that I feel like this,\u201d Cooper shook his body.</p><p>\u201cFeel like what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll out of control. Like I have no say in how this girl feels about me. It\u2019s like nothing I do matters to her the way it would to other girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always said she\u2019s not like other girls,\u201d Danny reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019ve never had to work this hard before. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I want to work this hard for her. But I want her to want me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it bro. Maybe you\u2019re reading into it.\u201d</p><p>Cooper agreed, \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Taylor rushed over to Katherine as she held the door open with her foot. Flowers spilled out of their arms.</p><p>\u201cSo? How sweet are our guys?\u201d Taylor asked, her voice smitten.</p><p>\u201cThey are pretty amazing.\u201d Katherine turned to see the Cooper and Danny waving from the Jeep. The girls smiled and waved back. They lugged their bags up to their room and tossed them on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to head over there after they get done with practice. Did you wanna come with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight. I\u2019m really tired and I have a paper to write.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Is that what you\u2019re telling people?\u201d Katherine gave Taylor a look of confusion, but Taylor saw through it. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really am tired, Tay. I feel emotionally wrecked.\u201d She wanted to be brutally honest with Taylor, but she didn\u2019t want to feel judged by her. \u201cAnd honestly, I really miss your brother.\u201d</p><p>There. She\u2019d admitted it. Out loud.</p><p>\u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t start doing this,\u201d Taylor\u2019s voice rose with concern.</p><p>\u201cStart doing...what exactly?\u201d Katherine asked, dragging out the \u2018what\u2019 for emphasis.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t stop living your life, or seeing Cooper, because you want to see my brother. It\u2019s just creepy, Kat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not stopping living my life, Taylor. It\u2019s ONE night. And I am tired!\u201d Katherine snapped.</p><p>She should have known Taylor wouldn\u2019t understand. How could she? She would just have to keep all things Austen locked inside from now on.</p><p>\u201cRight. One night will turn into two...and then two will turn into three...and then...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. It\u2019s not going to happen okay? I think I have a little more self-control than that,\u201d Katherine wasn\u2019t actually sure that she did. \u201cWould you even care that I was doing this if there was no Cooper Donovan in the picture?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It seemed, to Katherine at least, that all the negatives about Austen revolved around Cooper. She started to wonder if Coop was the reason this was even a problem at all. If there were no Cooper, then maybe Taylor wouldn\u2019t give her so much grief. Maybe Taylor would be happy for her and encourage her to be with Austen.</p><p>Taylor pondered the question for a minute before she answered. She looked at Katherine and said, \u201cI think that if there was no Cooper Donovan, it would still be creepy if all you wanted to do was sleep to see my brother. I\u2019d like to think that if there was just dream Austen in your life, I\u2019d still want you to go out and live and I\u2019d be concerned if you stopped doing that. Know what I mean?\u201d</p><p>Katherine recognized the truth in Taylor\u2019s words, but she didn\u2019t believe her entirely. \u201cI get what you\u2019re saying, I do. But I still think that Cooper changes things, whether you realize it or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be right,\u201d Taylor admitted. \u201cCooper probably does change things. He\u2019s real, alive, and a really good guy. If he was a complete jerk it would be one thing, but there\u2019s not a single jerky thing about him.\u201d</p> <p>Katherine gathered her school things together and headed out the door to the campus library while Taylor stayed behind and napped. Katherine was thankful for the time alone. She needed to be by herself and attempt to sort things out. She started to worry that she wasn\u2019t built to balance two guys. And if that was the case, she knew which one was going to lose. She also knew she\u2019d never hear the end of it from Taylor if that happened. Or anyone else for that matter.</p><p>But how could she possibly be expected to choose Cooper when she felt the way she did about Austen? She knew that any rational and sane person would choose the guy who was still alive. But her emotions weren\u2019t derived from rational thought. The heart wants what it wants; it can\u2019t be reasoned with. She wondered how she was supposed to explain that to anyone to make them understand. But then, she knew she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She studied for a few hours at the library before she walked back to the dorm. Taylor was already gone by the time she returned so she washed her face and headed to bed. She looked forward to being asleep and finally seeing Austen.</p><p>Sleep eluded her at first, causing her to toss and turn relentlessly. But once she was there, she sat in the sand and played with Brody. Austen stood silently behind her and watched.</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk about him at some point,\u201d Austen mentioned.</p> <p>\u201cTalk about who?\u201d She knew exactly who Austen referred to, but she longed to avoid the topic.</p><p>\u201cThe other guy in your life,\u201d Austen said rationally.</p><p>\u201cWhy do we have to talk about Cooper? I don\u2019t want to talk about him. I just want to be with you.\u201d She scooted closer to him and dropped her head into his shoulder. He wrapped his muscular arm around her waist and held her tight. His lips brushed against the top of her head as he ran his fingers through her hair.</p><p>\u201cA stronger man would walk away from you and let you live your life.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing quickened as fear ripped through her. \u201cClearly I\u2019m not that strong.\u201d He brushed his hand down her cheek, as calm quickly replaced the fear. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore the fact that Cooper\u2019s a big part of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to be,\u201d Katherine hastily retorted. She was so terrified at the thought of losing Austen she\u2019d do whatever it took to keep them together.</p> <p>\u201cI know that. But he\u2019s there for a reason, Katherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Katherine whined.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have told you about our other lifetimes? I know it\u2019s affected you deeply and I never meant to confuse you. I just couldn\u2019t keep it from you. But maybe that was selfish of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. I needed to know why you affected me the way you did. Nothing made any sense before you told me about our history. Everything clicked once you did.\u201d</p><p>Austen stared at her and she returned his gaze. She longed to stay in that place with him forever. The blue of his eyes pierced right through her.</p><p>\u201cYou know how much I love you, right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>That was one question she never needed to ask. Even if the words had never left his lips, she still would have known. That\u2019s how deeply they were connected.</p><p>Those were the last words Katherine heard before her eyes fluttered open.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming to class, right?\u201d Taylor studied her from across the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting up now.\u201d Katherine tossed off the covers and crept out from the warmth of her bed. She walked slowly into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t hurry, we\u2019re gonna be late,\u201d Taylor shouted through the closed door.</p><p>Katherine finally emerged and grabbed her bag as Taylor rushed out the door.</p><p>\u201cThe guys have a game tonight. You\u2019re coming, right?\u201d Taylor asked while she speed walked.</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine,\u201d Taylor groaned out her name with a huff.</p><p>To avoid conflict, Katherine quickly recanted, \u201cI\u2019ll go. Of course I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Taylor smiled.</p><p>From the moment Kat\u2019s eyes opened her thoughts consumed her. Her mind constantly compared the two guys competing for her heart. She loved being around Cooper and appreciated the way he made her feel. Her pulse raced whenever he looked or smiled in her direction. When he reached for her hand, or kissed her softly, her knees buckled and she prayed she wouldn\u2019t fall. Butterflies flapped recklessly in her stomach whenever Cooper was near. He made her feel alive, special, and wanted.</p><p>But with Austen it was all very, very different. He filled her entire being with a sense of serenity, calm, and her soul soared in his presence. There was a trust between them that existed beyond words. No love could be more genuine or pure.</p><p>\u201cSnap out of it, girlfriend. Cooper\u2019s straight ahead.\u201d</p><p>Katherine unscrewed her twisted thoughts and looked ahead. God, he was gorgeous. Even in jeans and a sweatshirt, he took her breath away. She figured he could probably wear a paper bag and still look good.</p><p>\u201cMorning, ladies,\u201d he said before he looked in Katherine\u2019s direction and asked, \u201cHow do you feel this morning?\u201d He tossed an arm across her shoulder and leaned in close.</p><p>She tilted her head toward him and said, \u201cMuch better, thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>Her defenses weakened when she looked in his eyes. Cooper Donovan seemed perfect. His personality\u2014 the way he treated her\u2014 not just his words, but his actions as well\u2014 they all added up to one unbelievable guy.</p><p>When they took their seats in the back of the classroom, Cooper focused on Katherine\u2019s eyes without saying a word. She could barely catch her breath when he did that and the smirk on his face told her that he knew the effect he had on her. He laughed softly and she jabbed at his arm.</p><p>\u201cOuch,\u201d Cooper winced playfully.</p><p>\u201cAs if. Don\u2019t do that to me,\u201d Katherine whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do what?\u201d he feigned innocently.</p><p>She glared in response as he just laughed.</p><p>Katherine opened the door to her room and Taylor shouted, \u201cThat better be you, Katherine Johns!\u201d</p><p>Katherine snickered, \u201cWho else would it be?\u201d</p><p>Taylor peered around the bathroom door and grimaced, \u201cMy boyfriend\u2019s going to look up in the stands and when he doesn\u2019t see me, he\u2019ll probably cry. Right there on the ice. You ruin everything,\u201d Taylor joked.</p><p>Katherine shook her head as she hurried to change tops. She hesitated for only a moment before Taylor pushed her out of the door.</p><p>\u201cCome on! We can\u2019t be late. Danny will kill me,\u201d Taylor whined.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to run, or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should make you carry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, we\u2019ll definitely get there faster if I carry you,\u201d Katherine chortled.</p><p>When they walked into the rink Katherine noticed the lack of available space. It was packed full. \u201cSorry Taylor, I didn\u2019t realize how crowded...\u201d</p><p>Taylor cut her off, \u201cCome on. Kristie saved us seats. Thank God.\u201d Taylor pulled Katherine down toward the row filled the player\u2019s girlfriends.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much. Sorry we\u2019re late. Did we miss anything?\u201d Taylor asked while she scanned the players on the ice.</p><p>\u201cIt just started. You didn\u2019t miss anything,\u201d Kristie responded.</p><p>Idle chit-chat filled the air as Taylor blamed Katherine for their lateness. \u201cShe hates Cooper, that\u2019s why we were late.\u201d</p><p>Katherine suddenly found all eyes focused on her. \u201cShe\u2019s kidding! I mean, yes I made us late, but I don\u2019t hate Cooper,\u201d she thwacked Taylor in the arm, \u201cBrat!\u201d</p><p>Taylor stuck out her tongue and mimicked her voice, \u201cBrat.\u201d</p><p>Katherine still didn\u2019t understand everything about hockey but admittedly, she loved watching Cooper on the ice. She respected and admired how passionately he played the game. Her insides warmed with pride as she watched him lead the team to yet another victory. When the game ended, he glanced up in the stands and smiled at her. She couldn\u2019t help but smile back as her cheeks flushed.</p><p>\u201cHe is so into you,\u201d one of the girls beamed.</p><p>Katherine didn\u2019t know what to say in response so she just smiled. The girls waited by the locker room door for the guys to exit. Cooper and Danny burst through the door and Danny grabbed Taylor and kissed her. He teased, \u201cYou were late!\u201d</p><p>She pointed at Katherine, \u201cIt was her fault.\u201d</p><p>Danny sauntered over to Katherine and squeezed her, \u201cYou both owe us.\u201d</p><p>Cooper grabbed Katherine\u2019s hand and ushered her outside. \u201cI agree with Danny. How are you girls going to make it up to us?\u201d</p><p>Taylor and Katherine looked at each other, \u201cWith kisses?\u201d Taylor suggested.</p><p>Danny laughed and said, \u201cI\u2019ll take that offer.\u201d He leaned down to kiss Taylor.</p><p>\u201cYeah, works for me.\u201d Cooper dropped his hockey bag and lifted Katherine up. She wrapped her legs around him and threw her arms around his neck. Thoughts of Austen rushed in and she instinctively pulled back. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Cooper placed her feet back on the ground.</p><p>\u201cNothing. Sorry,\u201d she lied.</p><p>She grabbed the back of his neck and pulled him toward her. He hesitated at first before slowly giving into her. Their mouths met and everything else faded into the background.</p><p>Taylor cleared her throat and interrupted, \u201cGonna kiss all night or do you guys want to go to Dom\u2019s? You\u2019re hungry, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could eat a horse,\u201d Danny said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that! I love horses and you know it!\u201d She punched him in the arm. He mimicked her words and she chased him around the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d Cooper asked Katherine while he secretly crossed his fingers.</p><p>Katherine looked into his eyes and answered, \u201cI could eat.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled in relief, \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Cooper and Danny tossed their hockey bags in the back of the Jeep and hurried toward the restaurant. \u201cAre you cold? Here, take my jacket.\u201d Cooper removed his jacket and placed it around Katherine\u2019s shoulders. He nuzzled her body into his and she sighed at how comfortable it was to be with him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dom\u2018s face lit up as he greeted the girls with a kiss and patted the guys firmly on their shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWho won?\u201d Dom asked.</p><p>\u201cWe did,\u201d Cooper responded.</p><p>Dom nodded his head and his face scrunched up as he smiled, \u201cGood-ah!\u201d</p> <p>Cooper still had his arm around Katherine as she scooted into the booth. He leaned into her ear and whispered, \u201cAre we okay?\u201d</p><p>Concern filled his voice and her stomach dropped. She felt terrible that she was doing this to him. Cooper treated her wonderfully and she wanted to push him away. The worst part was, he sensed it and she knew it. She noticed the eye with the speck in it and smiled, \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m being distant. It\u2019s not you.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, \u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged her shoulders and then responded, \u201cI\u2019ve just been kind of out of it since we got back from Taylor\u2019s. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m just...\u201d she paused to find the words, \u201cI don\u2019t know...distracted, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re okay? You still think I\u2019m the best thing to ever happen to you and I still have my girlfriend from California who makes me crazy, right?\u201d he smiled, his tone serious.</p> <p>It surprised her that he could sense things she tried to hide. She wondered how strong their connection truly was and pondered what it was about Cooper that made her feel so secure. She didn\u2019t want to lie to him, but she knew she couldn\u2019t tell him the truth either. It wasn\u2019t the right time or place for her to get into the details about Austen.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. We\u2019re good. You\u2019re still amazing and I\u2019m still crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d He kissed her cheek and rested his hand on her leg.</p><p>The days that followed were more of the same. Cooper tried to behave as if everything was normal but Katherine pushed him further away. He stopped asking her if she was ok. He didn\u2019t want to annoy her, but he sensed that something was off between them.</p><p>Stupidly, he thought it was something he had done. Or something he hadn\u2019t done. He wondered if maybe she wasn\u2019t into him any more. He couldn\u2019t figure out what had changed. Maybe we got too serious too fast, he asked himself. Maybe I scared her?</p><p>He wanted to figure out what was wrong between them so he could fix it. More than almost anything else, he wanted this girl by his side. She completed him. He knew how cheesy that sounded, but it was the truth. Something about Katherine Johns affected him in ways no girl ever had.</p> <p>Cooper decided to wait it out. If there was something that distracted Katherine, that distraction would eventually have to go away. He\u2019d simply wait until it did.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Kylie picked up Blake and they headed toward the college. She contemplated telling him that Katherine dreamed and talked with Austen. She felt betrayed that Taylor had sided with Katherine and needed to feel as though someone was on her side. But she couldn\u2019t bring herself to involve Blake. He had been devastated beyond repair when Austen died and she refused to put him through any more pain. Instead, she talked to him about school and girls and his friends.</p><p>Whenever Kylie\u2019s thoughts drifted to Katherine and Austen, her heart pounded out of control. She decided that if anyone was dreaming about Austen, it should be her... or at least a member of Austen\u2019s family. Not some stranger no one even knew before this past summer. Pain and bitterness consumed her.</p><p>\u201cThink we\u2019ll go to any parties?\u201d Blake asked.</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Kylie responded with a smile as her mind raced. She wondered if Little Miss Perfect had told her equally perfect boyfriend what was going on. A party would be the perfect place to confront Cooper and find out.</p><p>\u201cCool. Have you met Katherine\u2019s boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there when they first met. He\u2019s really great; you\u2019ll love him.\u201d</p> <p>Her thoughts drifted back to the party where she first saw Cooper. She remembered thinking how ridiculously good looking he was and how she was just about to go talk to him when she noticed him staring at Katherine. Envy and jealousy coursed through every inch of her body. The way Cooper stared at Katherine was unlike anything she\u2019d ever seen before. It was like no one else was in the room. Kylie shook her head to rid the images from her mind.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Tay\u2019s boyfriend? Have you met him?\u201d</p><p>Kylie was thankful that Blake seemed oblivious to the emotional war that raged in her mind.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Same party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m excited to meet them both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll like them a lot.\u201d She glanced toward him, \u201cAnd they\u2019ll love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d He turned to look out the passenger window.</p><p>\u201cThanks for bringing me, Kylie. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to get away, huh?\u201d She reached over and touched his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really realize that I never leave my house. It\u2019s funny because I sort of hate being there, but I never go anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>Kylie\u2019s face crinkled, \u201cWhat do you mean you hate being there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just not the same. You know, since Austen. It\u2019s hard living there,\u201d Blake\u2019s voice softened.</p><p>\u201cWell you always have me. I\u2019ll come steal you away anytime you want.\u201d She knew how close he and Austen had been and she wanted to be there for him too. Especially now since Taylor had moved away.</p><p>\u201cAre we almost there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just up around the bend over there,\u201d Kylie pointed through the windshield.</p><p>Taylor was excited to see Blake but nervous to see Kylie. The two girls had barely talked since the big blowout at Thanksgiving. She appreciated that Kylie brought Blake to visit but also wondered what she might have up her sleeve. Taylor knew that with Kylie, nothing was ever simple.</p><p>\u201cDo you think she\u2019s over the whole Austen thing?\u201d Katherine asked with trepidation.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever get over it, Kat. She didn\u2019t say anything to me about it, but we should avoid that entire subject if possible,\u201d Taylor warned.</p><p>She didn\u2019t appreciate having to run interference between her friends for an entire weekend. That kind of stuff irritated Taylor and she lacked the patience for it. She just wanted to have a nice calm weekend with her brother, but Kylie coming pretty much nixed that idea.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Kat sat down on the bed. \u201cBlake doesn\u2019t know, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no. And you can\u2019t tell him!\u201d Taylor\u2019s voice rose as her eyes widened. She would do whatever it took to protect her little brother. Her heart splintered at the thought of Blake hurting.</p><p>\u201cI would never. Kylie wouldn\u2019t either, right? Like, out of spite or anything?\u201d Katherine wondered.</p><p>\u201cKylie can be cruel, but she\u2019d never do anything to hurt my little brother.\u201d</p><p>When Kylie and Blake walked through the door, Taylor squealed. She ran over to her little brother and squeezed him tightly.</p><p>Kylie refused to look at Katherine. Katherine said \u2018hi,\u2019 but Kylie pretended not to hear her. Kylie watched as Blake walked over to Kat and gave her a hug.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you! I\u2019m glad you came. How are you? How\u2019s school? Are you excited to be here?\u201d Katherine asked quickly.</p><p>Taylor walked over to Kylie and squeezed her. \u201cThanks for bringing him Kyles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to any parties?\u201d Blake asked Taylor with a curious look.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d Taylor teased. She sensed his excitement and her heart palpitated with joy. It had been so long since she\u2019d seen true happiness in her brother\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Blake pursed his lips together in a tight smile and shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you aren\u2019t excited. We\u2019re going to one in a little. But first, we eat!\u201d</p><p>They took Blake on a quick tour of campus and pointed at the hockey rink in the distance. Blake\u2019s face lit up each time he saw something new.</p><p>\u201cThere are so many hot girls here. College is awesome.\u201d Blake constantly craned his neck to look in every direction.</p><p>Taylor laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>They stopped by Dominic\u2019s and picked up a pepperoni pie before heading back to the dorm to get ready for the party.</p><p>Katherine watched Blake\u2019s mouth drop open as he counted the number of people in his view. He looked at the crowded house party with wide eyes and shook his head in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cCrazy, right?\u201d Katherine commented.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d Blake shouted over the music.</p><p>They walked past girls dancing on the lawn, on the furniture, everywhere. The DJ mixed music in the living room as colorful lights danced across the ceiling. Blake noticed a group of girls whisper, then point at some guy.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Blake!\u201d Taylor grabbed his hand and headed out back.</p><p>Blake watched as a guy walked up to his sister and lifted her whole body off the ground. The guy said \u2018hi\u2019 to Kylie and Katherine before Taylor interjected, \u201cDanny, this is my little brother, Blake. Blake, this is my boyfriend, Danny.\u201d</p><p>Danny stuck out his hand and gripped Blake\u2019s forcefully. Blake waved his hand back and forth to ease the pain. Danny leaned toward him and said, \u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m totally in love with your sister. Sorry about the hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. And join the club. Everyone loves Taylor.\u201d</p><p>Blake started to chuckle when he noticed the guy all the girls had pointed at earlier walking in their direction. \u201cIs that Cooper?\u201d he asked Kylie.</p><p>\u201cSure is,\u201d she answered with wickedness in her voice.</p><p>Cooper walked over to the group and smiled. He grabbed Katherine by the waist, dipped her slightly and kissed her boldly on the mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of things being off between us. I\u2019m going to kiss our problems right out of you.\u201d He smirked at Katherine before crushing his lips against hers once again.</p><p>Kylie rolled her eyes at the public display of affection. Her stomach churned and she actually considered throwing up right on their feet.</p><p>When Cooper finished, he tilted Katherine upright and looked into her eyes. \u201cI forget how to breathe when you do that to me,\u201d Katherine admitted breathlessly.</p><p>Cooper smiled and glanced around at the group. \u201cHey, Kylie. Nice to see you again.\u201d He gave her a loose hug and then squeezed Taylor before being introduced to Blake. \u201cSo, Blake, what do you think of college life so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems pretty cool.\u201d He shouted.</p><p>\u201cComing to the game tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Blake peered at Taylor who nodded. \u201cYeah, I guess we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool, well I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d Cooper shook Blake\u2019s hand and leaned into Katherine, \u201cI\u2019m going to grab some water. Do you want anything?\u201d</p><p>Katherine shook her head no and Cooper started to walk off. Kylie seized the opportunity to talk to Cooper without anyone else around. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d she shouted and Cooper stopped walking so she could catch up.</p><p>Katherine shot Taylor a look and Taylor shrugged her shoulders. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, Cooper, how\u2019ve you been?\u201d Kylie started with small talk to break the ice.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t complain. You?\u201d He was so polite that Kylie almost felt bad for what she was about to do.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. So, how are things with you and Katherine?\u201d Kylie knew as long as Katherine dreamed about Austen there was no way things could be perfect between her and Cooper.</p><p>\u201cUm, they\u2019re fine.\u201d Cooper hesitated, \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p> <p>Kylie sensed Cooper\u2019s insecurities, \u201cOh, no reason really. Just wondering. I mean, with everything that happened over Thanksgiving, I just figured...\u201d her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Cooper unintentionally projected his voice.</p><p>Kylie watched Cooper\u2019s resolve weaken. He played right into her hands.</p><p>\u201cOh, she didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d Her questions tortured him, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cTell me what, Kylie?\u201d Cooper asked, agitated.</p> <p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just ask her who Austen is?\u201d Kylie turned to walk away as Cooper quickly grabbed her by the arm. \u201cHey!\u201d she shouted and shook her arm from his grip.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Austen?\u201d he asked through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cAsk your girlfriend,\u201d Kylie turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you!\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Kylie watched the adrenaline pump through his body as his chest heaved in and out in quick succession. She walked back to him and firmly stated, \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you to ask her.\u201d She leaned in close to Cooper\u2019s face and whispered in his ear, \u201cBut if you want to make her jealous, I know something we could do.\u201d</p><p>She glanced outside and noticed every pair of eyes from her group paying close attention to the drama unfolding in the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I want to make her jealous?\u201d Cooper asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cGeez, Cooper, are you really that clueless?\u201d Kylie turned around and glared at Katherine before returning her attention to Cooper. She grabbed the back of his head and pulled his mouth to hers. Her lips attacked his with a force and determination he couldn\u2019t resist.</p><p>Cooper pushed Kylie away just in time to see Katherine run out the front door. He sprinted after her and shouted her name. Katherine knew she couldn\u2019t outrun him, so she stopped. He jogged up to her and she stared at him, her heart in pain.</p><p>She knew why Kylie did it. She didn\u2019t blame her for it. But she hadn\u2019t realized how hurtful it would be to see Cooper kiss someone else. It pained her to witness that kiss. All she wanted to do was run to Austen. She thought of how he would never intentionally hurt her like that. Never allow someone to cause her that much pain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Katherine. Kylie caught me off guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Kiss whoever you want,\u201d Katherine turned to leave.</p><p>\u201cLike you apparently did?\u201d he shouted at her back.</p><p>She stopped and turned to face him, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou tell me. Who\u2019s Austen?\u201d</p><p>Hearing Cooper say Austen\u2019s name made her stomach fall to the ground. Her head started to spin as she struggled to steady her breathing. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, Cooper. Just leave it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Kat. Who is he? Is that why you\u2019re so different? Is there someone else?\u201d With each question he asked, his voice pained more and more.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want Cooper to be hurt any more than she wanted Kylie or Taylor to be. It seemed no matter what she did, it was unavoidable. Cooper didn\u2019t deserve this. He deserved answers. He deserved someone to love him with all of their heart. Something she couldn\u2019t do right now...or possibly ever.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. Just leave me alone, Cooper. It\u2019s for the best,\u201d she turned to walk away and he let her go.</p><p>A crowd of people watched Cooper and Katherine\u2019s argument. As Cooper walked back into the party, girls threw themselves at him. He ignored their advances, pretending they didn\u2019t exist. He found Taylor and asked her, \u201cTaylor, who is Austen?\u201d</p><p>Taylor immediately looked at Blake, who had a horrified expression on his face. \u201cShit. Not now, Cooper, sorry. We have to go.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed Blake by the hand and turned to Kylie and demanded, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d She gave Danny a quick kiss on the cheek and then sped off, dragging her baby brother behind her.</p><p>Kylie turned to Cooper and said, \u201cIf you ever want to make Kat jealous again, just let me know.\u201d She kissed him quickly on the mouth before he could stop her and then hurried to catch up with Taylor and Blake.</p><p>\u201cHow could you do that to her, Kylie?\u201d Taylor\u2019s voice was filled with rage.</p><p>\u201cShe deserved it and you know it,\u201d Kylie\u2019s responded with attitude.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? How did she deserve it? You did that to her on purpose. She didn\u2019t do anything to you on purpose. She never would. It wasn\u2019t even her fault about Austen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on? How did Cooper know about Austen, and what does he have to do with Katherine?\u201d Blake interjected.</p><p>Taylor shot Kylie a look that screamed she was going to kill her. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Blake. It\u2019s a weird story, but I don\u2019t want to talk it. Not here. Not right now,\u201d Taylor shook her head.</p><p>\u201cStop trying to protect me and just tell me what\u2019s going on. He was my brother, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s just kind of hard to explain,\u201d Taylor stalled when Kylie interrupted.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Katherine has dreams about Austen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Blake didn\u2019t get what that meant. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>Taylor hesitated, \u201cThey aren\u2019t just simple dreams. Austen sought Katherine out. Like he found her and now she spends almost every night with him in her dreams.\u201d</p><p>She turned to see Kylie\u2019s reaction. Kylie looked devastated.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean he sought her out?\u201d Blake questioned.</p><p>\u201cHe watches over us and stuff and he saw Katherine with me one day and apparently he couldn\u2019t stay away from her. I don\u2019t really know; they have this intense bond, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSTOP IT!\u201d Kylie screamed. \u201cI do not want to hear any more of this crap. I can\u2019t listen to how Austen and some stranger have an intense bond and...\u201d Her voice trailed off as she fought to stop the tears. She looked at Taylor and said, \u201cI loved him so much. And he loved me back. ME.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Kyles.\u201d Taylor held her friend. \u201cI don\u2019t think Austen would ever want to hurt you. And I know Katherine wouldn\u2019t, either. She\u2019s been torn up about the whole thing ever since we got back.\u201d Kylie cringed at the sound of Katherine\u2019s name.</p><p>Taylor continued, \u201cKylie, you can\u2019t go around treating people like crap because you\u2019re hurting. It\u2019s not right. You shouldn\u2019t have done that. You\u2019ve caused a lot of problems for Katherine and Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kind of don\u2019t care, Tay. I\u2019m sure Cooper can get over it with any one of his adoring fans. And I don\u2019t care about Katherine. I don\u2019t owe her anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept an apology,\u201d Blake added.</p><p>Blake\u2019s suggestion stopped Kylie in her tracks. \u201cYou really think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you did tonight was pretty messed up,\u201d he continued before she could interrupt. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I know that you\u2019re hurting real bad. But I don\u2019t think Kat deserved what you did to her.\u201d</p><p>Kylie took a deep breath and swallowed her pride, \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Blake smiled.</p><p>Taylor couldn\u2019t believe her little brother could talk sense into Kylie and she couldn\u2019t. She looked at him and mouthed \u2018thank you\u2019 and he smiled.</p><p>The three walked into the dorm room where Katherine lay in bed. She wasn\u2019t asleep, but she pretended to be. The two small stones from Austen\u2019s gravesite rested in the palm of her hand.</p><p>Kylie looked over at her and sat down on her bed. She shook Katherine\u2019s body gently, \u201cHey, Katherine?\u201d Katherine opened her eyes. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done what I did tonight. It was wrong and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kylie. I understand why you did it. I just need you to know that I really am so sorry for all the pain I\u2019ve caused you,\u201d Katherine\u2019s eyes filled with water.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so nice all the time?\u201d Kylie asked, irritated. \u201cI kissed Cooper, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And that really sucked,\u201d Katherine winced. \u201cI know how weird this whole Austen thing is. I just know that if I was in your shoes, I\u2019d feel really hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Kylie grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to hear you say his name. Like in my mind, Austen will always be mine. So I can\u2019t really listen to you talk about him and say the things you do without it making me want to throw up.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s eyes dropped, \u201cI understand completely. Thanks for being so honest with me.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s cell phone rang and Kylie huffed out a breath in relief. Katherine looked down to see Cooper\u2019s name and number on her phone. She pressed decline and less than a minute later her phone beeped with a text message.</p><p>\u201cCalifornia, please talk to me. Just tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cI should probably apologize to Cooper too,\u201d Kylie offered.</p><p>Taylor and Katherine glanced at each other before speaking. \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. He\u2019ll just end up asking you a bunch of questions and stuff that you won\u2019t have the answers to. I\u2019ll talk to him when the time\u2019s right,\u201d Katherine explained.</p><p>\u201cWhen the time\u2019s right, huh? When is that going to be?\u201d Taylor chastised.</p><p>Katherine faked a smile. She knew Cooper deserved the truth. But honestly, she just wished everyone would leave her and Austen alone.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask something?\u201d Blake broke the silence.</p><p>\u201cOh gosh, Blake, I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to leave you out.\u201d Katherine looked at him and apologized, \u201cOf course. You can ask me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry,\u201d he said quietly under his breath. \u201cI was just wondering if Austen has said anything to you about me?\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s heart broke for the little boy who lost his older brother. She knew Blake had looked up to Austen in ways she couldn\u2019t relate to since she was an only child.</p><p>She smiled before she told him, \u201cHonestly, I think he\u2019s a little worried about you. He loves you so much and just wants the very best for you and he\u2019s concerned that his dying has changed you forever. He told me he wishes you would remember all of your memories together, playing baseball and stuff, instead of the memory of him dying.\u201d</p><p>Blake\u2019s eyes turned glossy. \u201cDo you want me to stop? I know this must be really hard...and weird.\u201d Katherine hesitated and looked around the room, as both girls wiped at their eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I know it should be weird, but it\u2019s not,\u201d Blake looked over at Kylie.</p><p>Katherine was grateful Blake understood and wasn\u2019t angry or upset at her. \u201cHe just wants you to be okay again, Blake. He wants you to live your life and be happy. He wants the same for your parents, too. He understands how complicated it is. He knows it\u2019s not easy. I just think it\u2019s different for him now. I think he sees things in a way we can\u2019t even imagine because we\u2019re still alive. His perspective is so clear, where ours is clouded by everything we think and feel, you know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI just miss him so much,\u201d Blake admitted, as a few tears fell. He inhaled deeply.</p><p>\u201cHe misses you, too. He misses all of you.\u201d She looked directly at Kylie and reinforced, \u201cAll of you.\u201d</p><p>Kylie stood up as tears soaked her cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t hear this from you. It\u2019s hard and it hurts and there\u2019s no way he loves you. He doesn\u2019t even know you. This is crazy.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door to leave the room when Katherine\u2019s words stopped her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t go, Kylie. I\u2019m not trying to hurt you. Blake and I can go somewhere else and talk if this is upsetting you. I\u2019m so tired of upsetting you,\u201d she sighed deeply.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really have any more questions or anything,\u201d Blake said softly.</p><p>Kylie took a deep breath and pulled herself together. Taylor tried to comfort her. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, Kyles. My brother loved you and we all know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still does,\u201d Katherine added.</p><p>Kylie asked through her tears, \u201cDoes he talk about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does,\u201d Katherine nodded. \u201cHe told me how much he loved you and how passionate you two were for each other. He said it was crazy high school love, but it was real and it was true.\u201d</p> <p>Kylie smiled and for once, Kat felt relief that her words didn\u2019t add to her pain.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>It was the third time this week Taylor prepared to go to class alone. Katherine had barely left their dorm room since the party.</p><p>\u201cAre you really not coming?\u201d Taylor\u2019s tone was clearly disgusted.</p><p>Katherine looked up from bed and mumbled, \u201cI don\u2019t feel well. Just go without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you just trying to avoid Cooper?\u201d</p> <p>Katherine had ignored his calls and barely answered any of his text messages. When she did respond, they were one or two word answers that solved nothing and kept him more and more in the dark.</p><p>Katherine\u2019s eyes tightened as she snarled in response, \u201cThis has nothing to do with Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then it\u2019s about my brother?\u201d Taylor snarled.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you even talking about?\u201d Katherine asked defensively.</p><p>\u201cKat,\u201d Taylor\u2019s voice snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Katherine assumed what was coming next.</p><p>\u201cThis has to stop. It\u2019s not healthy. You\u2019re freaking me out to be honest. You can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what, Taylor? Sleeping? I have to sleep! Every night I have to sleep, just like you.\u201d Katherine behaved like a brat and she knew it.</p> <p>\u201cRight, but I don\u2019t sleep all day. I don\u2019t blow off classes to sleep so I can dream. This is ridiculous! My brother would not want you to do this to yourself. He would not want you to live like this,\u201d Taylor explained.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what he would want me to do. If he didn\u2019t want me to be with him all the time, why did he come to me in the first place? Why didn\u2019t he just go to you? Or to Kylie, for that matter? He came to me, Taylor. Me! So don\u2019t tell me what he wants because you don\u2019t even know.\u201d</p><p>Katherine was beyond reach. A rational conversation with her seemed as rare as reasoning with a drunk. Her mind was a place where logic failed to live any more.</p><p>\u201cKat, listen to me. All I\u2019m saying is that you have to stop blowing off your life for these dreams. Okay? You have to stop avoiding Cooper. You have to stop avoiding everything. Your life is happening right in front of you, but you won\u2019t open your eyes to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we leave for winter break in a couple of days, so you won\u2019t have to deal with it. I won\u2019t be your problem any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. You\u2019re not a problem. It\u2019s just that...I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust leave me alone.\u201d</p><p>Taylor grunted and Katherine cursed under her breath as the door slammed. Her head hit the pillow and she fell into her dreams.</p><p>She walked along the pathway toward the bench where Austen sat. He didn\u2019t get up to greet her as usual. Once she got close enough he motioned for her to sit next to him. This wasn\u2019t a good sign. She sat down as he slipped his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cTaylor\u2019s right, you know,\u201d he said, while he softly stroked her hair.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d she knew exactly what he referred to.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t keep doing this to you.\u201d He grazed the side of her cheek with his hand and her heart soared. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to you or Cooper,\u201d he added calmly.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make this about Cooper. This isn\u2019t about Cooper. This is about you and me and only you and me,\u201d her voice rose in sync with her defenses.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t right. You\u2019re not living your life. And I love you too much to let you do this to yourself.\u201d</p><p>Katherine broke down. Her body filled with excruciating pain and each breath felt like a struggle to take. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave me. You promised you\u2019d never leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t ever leave you. I\u2019ll always be around. But it\u2019s not right for me to keep doing this to you.\u201d His face twisted in pain. \u201cI have to let you go before I ruin your life completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said forcefully. \u201cNo!\u201d she screamed as her body shook.</p><p>\u201cKatherine, be reasonable, please.\u201d</p><p>Her body crashed into the sand as she pressed her hands against her face. Her eyes looked up as she realized, \u201cYou can\u2019t be the one to leave, Austen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He tilted his head as his blue eyes gazed into hers.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re the one who leaves me...if it\u2019s your decision to end things, if you\u2019re the one who walks away...\u201d She took a breath and finished, \u201cI\u2019ll never get over you. I\u2019ll never be okay. I\u2019ll always be broken somehow. You have to understand that.\u201d</p><p>He nodded in agreement, \u201cSo what\u2019s your solution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be the one who leaves.\u201d She knew Austen was right. She knew they had to stop. \u201cI just can\u2019t do it tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t happy. Being on your timeline means I get more of you. But Katherine, this isn\u2019t a joke. There has to be an end to this and if you stall for too long, I\u2019ll have to be the one who leaves. Please remember that,\u201d Austen explained.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a threat, but his words were like daggers in her already bludgeoned heart.</p><p>Katherine\u2019s eyes opened and darkness had filled the room. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d eaten anything. She thought briefly about calling Cooper, but put her phone down before she dialed. What would she say to him? He probably hated her. She wouldn\u2019t blame him if he did.</p><p>Taylor wasn\u2019t there and Katherine assumed she was at Danny\u2019s. Or maybe there was a hockey game? She couldn\u2019t remember any more. She reached for her laptop and looked up the hockey schedule online. They had a game, but it was already in the third period. If she hurried, she could still catch the end of it.</p><p>She fought with herself. Should she go confuse Cooper even more, or keep avoiding him? Taylor would be surprised to see her. But so would all the other girls. Katherine imagine the plethora of questions. Where have you been? Are you and Cooper okay? Did you guys break up? Katherine wasn\u2019t ready to face any of that.</p><p>She decided to pack for home. Katherine hadn\u2019t been back since school started. She couldn\u2019t wait to get home to the sun. Her mind drifted to the things she missed...the beaches, the comfort of her old bedroom, her old friends and even her parents.</p><p>The door swung open and Taylor bounced in. She didn\u2019t acknowledge Katherine as she headed to the bathroom to wash her face. The silent treatment didn\u2019t last long. \u201cPacking for home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Katherine didn\u2019t look up from her suitcase.</p><p>\u201cCooper asked me when you were leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you tell him?\u201d she stopped folding her shirt and looked in Taylor\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cI told him I knew you left on Friday, but I wasn\u2019t sure what time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured,\u201d Taylor\u2019s tone of voice was slightly agitated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d Katherine\u2019s voice was on edge.</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have so much to tell him. There\u2019s so much I need to explain. I just can\u2019t do it right now. I\u2019m not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen then? When it\u2019s too late and you\u2019ve lost him?\u201d</p><p>Katherine was surprised at the sadness that followed hearing those words. \u201cI hope not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you getting to the airport anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe school has a shuttle for students. I\u2019m taking that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you figure things out during break. I miss the old you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d Katherine hoped to come back refreshed, rejuvenated and hopefully a little saner.</p><p>Katherine loaded her suitcase onto the shuttle and took a window seat in the back. The engine roared to life and the shuttle rumbled under her feet. As they started to pull away, she noticed Cooper\u2019s Jeep tear into the parking lot. He had tried to catch her before she left, but he was too late.</p><p>A part of her was thankful she avoided the confrontation. Another part was comforted to see he still cared. She searched the Jeep for his face. His green eyes caught hers through the shuttle window and locked on. He made a gesture with his hand and his eyes fell. Katherine turned her head and looked away.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Katherine walked off the plane and headed toward baggage claim. She sent her dad a text to let him know she had arrived. When she got downstairs, she saw his face immediately and her eyes started to well up. She hadn\u2019t realized just how much she missed her dad until she saw him standing there. His eyes looked tired, but then his face lit up with his big, happy smile. He looked so excited to see her.</p><p>Katherine walked over to him and dove into his arms, \u201cHi, Daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, kiddo. How was your flight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUneventful. And long,\u201d she yawned.</p><p>\u201cYou hungry?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cStarved,\u201d she replied.</p><p>Her dad gave her another squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Dad. Where\u2019s Mom?\u201d she smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cAt home making your favorite dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Katherine was excited.</p><p>Katherine\u2019s cell phone vibrated in her pocket. It was a text message from Cooper. \u201cHope you had a safe flight. I really miss you, California.\u201d She took a deep breath and felt her eyes well up slightly.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay, kiddo?\u201d her dad noticed her reaction. \u201cWho was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a guy I\u2019m kind of dating. It\u2019s no big deal, I\u2019m fine.\u201d She forced a smile and wrote Cooper back, \u201cI\u2019m here safe &amp; sound. I miss you too.\u201d She wrote him those words because she meant them. But at this point, it still didn\u2019t change anything.</p><p>\u201cA guy? Who is he?\u201d Her dad grabbed the oversized brown suitcase from baggage claim and they headed out the doors toward the car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Cooper. He\u2019s a big-shot hockey player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHockey player, huh? Is he nice? Smart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad. He\u2019s all of those things. You\u2019d love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Katherine was shocked that her dad could read her so well.</p><p>\u201cCome on, kid. I know you better than that. What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><p>Katherine looked at her dad and laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with him, Dad. It\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what\u2019s wrong with you, then?\u201d He gave her a weird look and stopped at the back of a small white Lexus. He tossed her suitcase in the trunk and hopped into the driver seat.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m just not sure what I want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ll figure it out, honey.\u201d He smiled at her before he directed the car\u2019s phone system to call home.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d A woman\u2019s voice asked pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cHi, hon. We\u2019re on our way,\u201d he said cheerily.</p><p>\u201cGreat! See you guys soon. Hi, Katherine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom!\u201d Her mom\u2019s voice sounded so excited, it made Katherine smile.</p><p>Katherine looked around from the passenger seat at everything she\u2019d missed since being away. She smiled when she saw the familiar palm tree lined streets of her childhood.</p> <p>When they rounded the corner she saw her house down the street on the left. The single story, light blue bungalow with the weathered white trim sat a mere three blocks from the beach. Colorful flowers dotted the front ledge and Katherine realized how dreary and colorless winter could be on the East Coast.</p><p>Her father pulled into the small driveway that led to a one-car garage behind the house. Katherine hopped out and noticed all the additions to the backyard. \u201cThe yard looks so nice, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat?\u201d she heard her mother\u2019s voice excitedly say her name as she ran out of the back door and smiled.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d Kat met her mom with a big hug. \u201cI love the fountain! And the yard looks so pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does look nice, doesn\u2019t it? Finally got my fountain,\u201d she winked at her only daughter.</p><p>The yard had been transformed into a sanctuary. \u201cIt\u2019s so peaceful,\u201d Katherine commented, as she imagined spending all her time there.</p><p>A three tiered fountain stood in the middle of the courtyard, surrounded by gorgeous light gray paver stones. A wood table that sat six sat dead center, surrounded by three oversized chairs with brightly colored cushions. Large white candles rested inside mason jars hung from the painted white patio slats.</p><p>The three walked into the kitchen through the back door and were immediately greeted with the smell of Italian spices. The smell reminded her of Dom\u2019s restaurant. \u201cIt smells amazing, Mom. Thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d her mom replied with a smile.</p><p>Katherine walked toward her room at the back of the house. She tossed her suitcase on the bed without turning on the light and walked back out to help set the table. Her mom placed the manicotti, salad, and homemade garlic bread onto the center of the table.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s school? You look tired,\u201d she commented.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great. And yeah, it\u2019s been exhausting lately,\u201d Katherine answered.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Taylor?\u201d Katherine had told her mom all about her roommate during one of their phone conversations.</p><p>Katherine\u2019s face dropped a bit at the sound of her name. \u201cShe\u2019s awesome.\u201d She made a mental note to text Taylor once she was done with dinner. She\u2019d only been gone a day, but she missed her friend.</p><p>\u201cAnd Cooper? Are you two still seeing each other?\u201d her mom asked.</p><p>Katherine\u2019s dad looked up from his plate and whined, \u201cYou knew about this guy? No one tells me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwww, Dad,\u201d she got up and gave him a quick squeeze before she sat back in her chair. \u201cKind of. It\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d The last thing Katherine wanted to do was try to explain Austen to her parents. Mostly, she didn\u2019t want them to worry, but she also knew they wouldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cWell, what happened? Did you two have a fight?\u201d Katherine\u2019s mom always saw things in black and white, as if life wasn\u2019t filled with shades of gray.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s nothing like that. I\u2019m just not sure how I feel about him,\u201d Kat said as she shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>Her mom stopped eating and looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been extremely picky, Katherine. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he didn\u2019t live up to your expectations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that, Mom. Jeez.\u201d Katherine was already irritated and she had only been home for five minutes. She felt like her mother could never relate to anything Katherine felt or thought.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kat, I don\u2019t think Mom was trying to upset you,\u201d her dad said as he tried to keep the peace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. I just thought you really liked him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Katherine really wanted to stop talking about Cooper Donovan. She had to deal with Cooper conversations at school and the last thing she wanted was to continue them at home.</p><p>Her parents looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders. They had stopped trying to figure out their only daughter years ago. She often made decisions that didn\u2019t make any sense to them.</p><p>Her mother cleaned up the dishes from dinner while Katherine unpacked. Her room looked like something from Coastal Living Magazine. The walls were painted a shade of blue that looked like water, and the crown and base moldings were painted white. Her carpet was the color of sand and she liked the way it felt on her bare feet. The dresser, nightstand, and bed frame all matched in white, weathered wood. A large mirror held movie stubs and pictures of Katherine with her high school friends. Photographs she had taken hung in various frames along her walls.</p><p>She sat on her bed and sent Taylor a text. \u201cI miss you. I\u2019m sorry for everything lately. I\u2019m going to try to get better.\u201d</p><p>Less than a minute later, she got a response. \u201cI miss you too. Come back normal, k? Thanks. lol\u201d Katherine laughed out loud when she read it and set her phone aside.</p><p>The time difference quickly caught up to her and before she knew it, she had nodded off. She told her parents goodnight and headed back up to her room.</p><p>She sat on the bench and traced a carved heart with her finger. Austen turned around when he sensed her and jogged in her direction, his face full of smiles. He took her by the hands and pulled her off the bench. They hugged and he kissed her passionately. She ran her fingers through his sandy brown hair and then ran her hands across his muscular frame.</p><p>\u201cAusten, I\u2019m never going to be able to tell you goodbye if you keep kissing me like that.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her and she couldn\u2019t help but smile back. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a way. Happy to be home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice. But it\u2019s also nice not being here, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Katherine was aware that\u2014even in her dream state\u2014she needed to get her life in order. There was no way she could go back to school the same way she left.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he sensed her distance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just thinking about how we\u2019re supposed to be letting each other go. But the idea of not being with you seems wrong. Why would I want to purposely cause myself that much pain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to do it today, or tomorrow.\u201d He leaned in and kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cBut the time will come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so calm? How are you totally okay with not being with me?\u201d Whenever she thought about not being with Austen, she could barely function.</p><p>\u201cNot being with you is the hardest thing I\u2019ll ever have to do. But I\u2019ll always do what\u2019s best for you, Katherine. Even if it\u2019s not what I want. Even if it hurts me so deeply I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever truly get over it. I\u2019ll do what is best for you and your life, no matter what the consequences are for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we have any other options? Isn\u2019t there anything else we can do? Why is it all or nothing?\u201d Katherine longed for a compromise.</p><p>\u201cSaying goodbye is the only option. It\u2019s the only way,\u201d Austen was firm.</p><p>Her eyes filled with sorrow as he tilted her mouth gently up to his to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you,\u201d Austen smiled at her and...</p><p>...she opened her eyes. She sat up in bed and held on to her covers tightly.</p><p>There was a quick knock on Katherine\u2019s front door and then she heard it open and slam shut. \u201cI\u2019m here! Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoph? I\u2019m in my room.\u201d Katherine\u2019s best friend and neighbor since childhood ran to the back of the house.</p><p>\u201cStill in bed? It\u2019s eleven o\u2019clock, ya sack! Get up!\u201d Sophia jumped in Katherine\u2019s bed and gave her a hug. Sophia was a petite brunette with blonde highlights. She had brown eyes and full lips.</p><p>Katherine laughed at her hyper best friend before she said, \u201cHi to you too! You look so good! How\u2019s Arizona?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awesome. I love. What about you and the E.C.? Isn\u2019t it freezing there?\u201d Sophia scrunched her nose at the thought.</p><p>Katherine thought for a minute and quickly realized that the \u201cE.C.\u201d stood for the \u201cEast Coast.\u201d Sophia often made up her own language. \u201cIt is freezing. But I love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor real? I\u2019ll never understand why you wanted to get so far away from here,\u201d Sophia said, with a look of confusion.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted something different. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine Johns, the girl who has everything, but still wants something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Katherine rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSo where do you want to go? What do you want to do?\u201d Sophia asked.</p><p>\u201cI really want to walk around Venice. I miss the beach and the weirdos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome! I need some new sunglasses so that\u2019s perf.\u201d</p><p>The girls walked along the sandy pathway in Venice. Sophia stopped to look at sunglasses and tried on at least fifty different pairs before deciding on one. She spotted the row of tarot card readers ahead of them.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kat, let\u2019s get our cards read. Like old times! Come on,\u201d Sophia pleaded.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Katherine smiled and then wondered, \u201cWhich lady should we go to this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm,\u201d Sophia looked around, \u201cHow about her? I\u2019ve never seen her before.\u201d</p><p>Katherine looked at the woman. She wore large turquoise gemstone jewelry around her neck, ears and wrists. Her curly gray hair hung at her shoulders and a baby blue bandana fit snug against the top of her head. Katherine noted that the woman\u2019s lipstick was an awful shade of pink and that she wore glasses which were rimmed in gold.</p><p>The woman\u2019s table was covered with a multi-colored sheer cloth. Various sizes of dark blue candles burned and she glanced up as Katherine watched her.</p><p>\u201cCome here, child,\u201d the woman spoke in Katherine\u2019s direction.</p><p>Katherine smiled nervously and walked toward the woman. \u201cShuffle the cards. Make sure you don\u2019t let them touch anything but your hands. The cards need your energy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Katherine did as she was told. The cards felt stiff in her hands and she wasn\u2019t sure if she should shuffle them like a regular card deck, or some other way. She decided to gently insert half the deck into the other half, never letting the cards touch anything but her hands and the air around them.</p><p>\u201cWhen you feel like you have shuffled enough, place the cards down in front of me. Then cut the deck once, any way you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Katherine glanced back at Sophia who watched the tarot lady with intense curiosity. Kat placed the cards in front of the woman and cut them into two uneven stacks.</p><p>The reader took a deep breath and closed her eyes before placing the split cards on top of one another. She turned over the first card. The dreamer. The woman took a deep breath and then answered someone only she could hear, with a nod of her head.</p> <p>The woman looked at Katherine with concern. \u201cYou are being haunted in your dreams by a great love. Oh yes, he loves you very much. And you love him as well.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s heart leapt. Not wanting to give anything away, she maintained her composure.</p><p>The woman continued to speak slowly and with caution. \u201cThere is much confusion around this person and...I see that you can\u2019t be with him, or he can\u2019t be with you?\u201d The woman glanced up at Katherine with unease.</p><p>She turned over another card and said, \u201cOh, but there is another boy who is fighting for your affections. He is handsome and strong and cares for you, too.\u201d</p><p>Katherine freaked out. Never in her life had a reader come so close to her actual reality. \u201cThere is much sadness and confusion surrounding you lately.\u201d The woman took a breath. \u201cAnd a decision will have to be made between these two boys.\u201d</p> <p>The woman didn\u2019t look up from the table as she spoke. She focused on the cards before her and the information she seemed to receive. \u201cYour hand will be forced.\u201d</p><p>Katherine hung on to every word that spilled out of the stranger\u2019s mouth. \u201cYes, unfortunate events will occur, I\u2019m sorry to say. The decision must be made or it will be made for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunate events? What do you mean?\u201d Katherine interrupted, as her voice shook nervously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, child, the cards don\u2019t tell me everything. But I see there will be no other choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen certain events occur, you will have to make a decision. There will be no other way. You will have to choose one.\u201d</p> <p>The gray-haired woman shook her head and looked into Katherine\u2019s eyes before saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s all the information I\u2019m getting.\u201d She took Katherine\u2019s hand in hers and looked steadily at her palm. \u201cYou\u2019ve lived many lives. You\u2019re a very old soul.\u201d</p><p>She peered into Katherine\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut you already know this,\u201d the woman smiled warmly.</p><p>Katherine was rattled as she handed the woman a twenty dollar bill, smiled slightly and said, \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you want a reading as well, dear?\u201d the woman asked Sophia with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll pass,\u201d Sophia waved her off, noticing the look on Katherine\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d Sophia asked.</p><p>Katherine snapped back into reality and looked at her friend\u2019s face before muttering, \u201cKind of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I\u2019m starved, so you\u2019re coming with.\u201d The girls walked the path toward a small caf\u00e9 with outdoor seating. They sat down at a table that faced the water. Katherine stared at the ocean and silently replayed what the woman had told her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell was that? Who are the guys she was talking about? And what about the haunting dreams? That was weird,\u201d Sophia wanted information.</p><p>Katherine couldn\u2019t hide the fact that she was freaked out. She tried her best to play it off. \u201cWell, she was definitely talking about Cooper. He\u2019s the hockey player I told you about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other guy?\u201d Sophia wondered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think she meant my roommate\u2019s brother. I sort of have a crush on him.\u201d Katherine figured a few white lies wouldn\u2019t hurt. Plus, she had no idea how to explain Austen to Sophia.</p><p>\u201cWhen she said unfortunate events, that kinda freaked me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to die or something, do you?\u201d Sophia asked semi seriously.</p><p>\u201cWell...I didn\u2019t.\u201d Katherine was even more worried than before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying. She was freaky. Don\u2019t die, k?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonder who you\u2019re going to choose?\u201d Sophia smiled and Katherine shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll see.\u201d Katherine tried desperately to change the subject. \u201cTell me all about Arizona.\u201d</p><p>Sophia\u2019s face changed as she talked a mile a minute. She would talk her own shadow\u2019s ear off if she could. The rest of their lunch and walk home were filled with talk of Arizona, fraternities, guys, and parties. They stopped on the corner of their street and hugged goodbye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you later,\u201d Sophia said as she walked in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cK. Thanks for lunch.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s house was empty and she was thankful for the quiet. Her phone beeped with the sound of a text message. It was Cooper again. \u201cHope everything is good. Just thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Thanks. Hope you\u2019re well. Tell your parents hello for me.\u201d She longed to tell him so much more, but stopped herself.</p><p>Katherine couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what the tarot reader had said. She sat in her new back yard as the words replayed in her mind.</p><p>She must have dozed off because Austen suddenly appeared next to her.</p><p>\u201cThat was some tarot card reading today,\u201d he said as he nuzzled into her.</p><p>She was surprised to see him there, in her back yard, instead of their usual meeting place. \u201cWhat did she mean, Austen? Do you know? Is something bad going to happen?\u201d</p><p>He hushed her gently to comfort her. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry? Austen, she said \u2018unfortunate events\u2019...those aren\u2019t fun and happy words. Something bad is going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. She could be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she knew about you. And Cooper. And...\u201d</p><p>Austen cut her off, \u201cI know. I heard. But the future can be changed, Katherine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing is set in stone. Events may be headed in one direction at the time, but you can change your course. And that changes your direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then it doesn\u2019t have to happen the way she said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said reassuringly.</p><p>\u201cSo it can all be changed then?\u201d Katherine breathed in relief.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good.\u201d She looked into Austen\u2019s eyes and suddenly changed her tone. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at the question. \u201cI\u2019m good. How are you?\u201d</p><p>She laughed as well at the absurdity of the question. \u201cBetter now, but I have a random question for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen Taylor at all? You know, since I left?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd? How is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019s Taylor. But she misses you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss her, too,\u201d Katherine glanced downwards.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, Katherine.\u201d He turned her face so she could watch him speak. \u201cOnce you get back to school, everything will be the way it was before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that? What if everyone hates me for how I\u2019ve acted?\u201d her eyes started to well up.</p><p>\u201cListen to me.\u201d She didn\u2019t move. \u201cNo one hates you. Do you hear me?\u201d She wanted to believe his words. \u201cNo one hates you,\u201d he spoke clearly and slowly.</p><p>\u201cI have been such a jerk to Taylor. And I\u2019ve completely ignored Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not since you\u2019ve been back home, right?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, everything is already getting better.\u201d He smiled at her lovingly.</p><p>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine. When people care about you the way Taylor and Cooper do, it doesn\u2019t take much for them to forgive you. They\u2019re just worried about you. Of course Cooper has no idea what\u2019s going on, so he\u2019s just really confused.\u201d</p><p>It still made Katherine cringe when Austen brought up Cooper\u2019s name. She never understood how he could be so calm about the whole thing. She expected him to hate Cooper, or at least want to hate him. But he didn\u2019t seem to.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFinally, something we can both agree on.\u201d He half smiled and she smiled back.</p><p>Her eyes opened to the sound of grocery bags being set on the counter and her mother\u2019s voice calling her name. \u201cI\u2019m out back, Mom.\u201d</p><p>Her mom poked her head out the back door. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d be back from the beach yet. How was Sophia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s great. Do you need help?\u201d Katherine started to get up out of the oversized chair.</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I\u2019ve got it. You enjoy the yard.\u201d</p><p>Katherine repositioned herself and grabbed her cell phone. She was nervous but relief immediately washed over her when Taylor answered the phone excitedly. They spoke briefly, but it was enough to set Katherine\u2019s worried mind at ease. She apologized again for her behavior and Taylor accepted without hesitation. Austen had been right. It wouldn\u2019t take much to mend their relationship because it hadn\u2019t truly been broken in the first place.</p><p>Katherine felt like she truly knew the meaning of the saying \u201cDistance makes the heart grow fonder\u201d as the days flew into weeks. She missed Taylor\u2019s company every day and she was surprised by how much she genuinely missed Cooper.</p><p>She thought of him often, but never told him. She knew she owed him so much more than a stupid text message after everything that had happened and she wasn\u2019t about to have that conversation over the phone. Everything she needed to tell him needed to be said in person.</p><p>Katherine packed up the last of her things, gave her mom one last hug, and waited as her dad backed up the car.</p><p>\u201cCall me when you land.\u201d Her mother gave her another squeeze that took the breath out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to squeeze me to death, Mom,\u201d Katherine choked out.</p><p>\u201cHave fun at school, but not too much. Get your grades back up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I promise.\u201d Katherine had reassured her parents many times that her lapse in grades was only temporary and she\u2019d work extra hard to get them back up to where they needed to be.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d her mom said.</p><p>\u201cLove you too, Mom,\u201d Katherine walked toward the car where her father waited.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Taylor picked Katherine up from the airport and when they saw each other, they squealed and then cried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for the way I acted before break, Taylor.\u201d Katherine felt like a horrible friend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know. No more apologies,\u201d Taylor waved her off.</p><p>\u201cI am so happy to be back here. I totally missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>The girls were quiet in the car for a few minutes before Taylor broke the silence. \u201cI know this is probably a long shot but, we\u2019re going to Cooper\u2019s lake house this weekend. You should really come with us. The lake is completely frozen over and we can ice skate on it and stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Katherine didn\u2019t respond so Taylor asked, \u201cHave you ever seen a frozen lake before?\u201d</p><p>Katherine laughed, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease come. It will be fun, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe and Danny, of course...um, Cooper and a couple other guys from the hockey team. I think that\u2019s it.\u201d</p> <p>Katherine pondered the details of the weekend. It would be the perfect place to finally talk to Cooper. She nodded and asked, \u201cDo you think Cooper will mind if I go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way,\u201d Taylor answered, overly reassuring.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go. It sounds fun.\u201d Katherine agreed with a hint of excitement in her voice. \u201cAre you sure Cooper won\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? That kid asked about you a hundred times over break. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Taylor\u2019s voice hitched.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re positive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m positive. Besides, you two have to talk eventually. What better time than this?\u201d</p> <p>Katherine was grateful that the first week back at school was less than challenging. She had a lot of extra work to make up in her classes since she had slacked so badly before the break. Her parents threatened to bring her home if she couldn\u2019t handle living on her own. And going back home was the last thing Katherine wanted. She was determined to make up all the work she\u2019d missed and get her grades back up.</p><p>When she saw Cooper in class, he was cordial, yet distant. Things had definitely changed between them. Long gone were the days when he greeted her with a kiss. He didn\u2019t try to hold her hand or show her any sort of affection. He barely made eye contact and she was convinced he hated her.</p><p>Seeing Cooper still tied her stomach in knots. One glimpse into his green eyes and she struggled to remember where she was. Sitting next to him made it hard for her to concentrate on anything other than him.</p><p>When class ended, she noticed him turn toward her and then quickly turn away. She looked around the classroom for him, but he had disappeared just like he had on that first day.</p><p>She turned to Taylor. \u201cThat was...weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows I\u2019m coming this weekend right?\u201d Katherine asked, concerned. If her presence was going to ruin the whole trip, she didn\u2019t want to go.</p><p>\u201cHe knows,\u201d Taylor answered in an annoyed tone.</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure he\u2019s okay with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is. I promise. I talked to him.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s ears pricked up at the last statement. \u201cYou talked to him? When? What did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s happy you\u2019re coming, Katherine. I think he just...I don\u2019t know, isn\u2019t sure how to deal with you right now. You know?\u201d</p><p>Katherine looked down at the ground, \u201cYeah. That makes sense.\u201d</p><p>Taylor pointed at Katherine. \u201cUh-uh. I know that face! Don\u2019t even think about backing out of this trip. You are coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not...backing out,\u201d Katherine stumbled over her words.</p><p>\u201cI know you better than that. I promise it will be fine. You guys just need to talk about everything. Get it all out in the open, you know?\u201d</p><p>Katherine agreed.</p><p>\u201cNot to change the subject or anything, but do you still dream about my brother?\u201d Taylor wondered.</p><p>A huge smile crept over Katherine\u2019s face and her eyes lit up. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s changed, then? I mean, not for nothing, it just seems like you want to patch things up with Cooper. Or am I reading this totally wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm...your brother and I have had many conversations about how we have to stop what\u2019s going on. We both know what we have to do, but neither one of us can actually do it. At least, not yet. But it\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then...\u201d</p><p>Katherine interrupted her, \u201cSo it\u2019s not about getting back together with Cooper so much as I owe him an apology and an explanation. Your brother talks about him all the time. He makes me crazy with the constant Cooper chatter.\u201d</p><p>Taylor laughed, \u201cWhat does he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just always brings him up. Says how Cooper\u2019s a good guy who really cares about me and stuff. He tells me that I should be with him. It\u2019s so irritating.\u201d</p><p>Taylor smiled, \u201cThat sounds like Austen. He\u2019d push you to be with Cooper because it\u2019s the right thing to do. And because it\u2019s the best thing for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound just like him.\u201d</p><p>Taylor\u2019s face softened.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Katherine sensed Taylor\u2019s pain.</p><p>\u201cI just...felt bad for my brother for a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, \u2019cause he irritates me?\u201d</p><p>Taylor chuckled, \u201cNo, because I imagine it must be so hard for him to let you go and watch you love someone else...no matter how much he claims to like the guy.\u201d</p><p>Katherine sighed, \u201cI don\u2019t know how he can stand it. He\u2019s a much better person than I could ever be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe always has been.\u201d Taylor looked at Kat and quickly recovered, \u201cNot better than you. Just a better person, in general. He was always that way.\u201d</p><p>Katherine grinned at her friend reassuringly. \u201cI knew what you meant.\u201d</p><p>Katherine shivered as she waited in the cold winter air for Cooper and Danny to arrive. When she saw the black Jeep Wrangler pull into the parking lot, she thought to herself how different it looked with the hard top on. The guys hopped out to grab the bags as Katherine avoided Cooper\u2019s eyes. She was scared to look at him.</p><p>\u201cHey, California,\u201d Cooper\u2019s voice sounded different. Damaged or broken, somehow.</p><p>\u201cHey, Coop.\u201d She couldn\u2019t avoid looking at him any longer. \u201cThanks for letting me come along.\u201d His eyes revealed hurt and longing that made her feel even worse.</p><p>\u201cAny time,\u201d he faked a smile.</p><p>Once they were on the road, Katherine wondered where the rest of the guys were. \u201cSo who else is coming?\u201d</p><p>Cooper glanced into his rearview mirror and locked eyes with her briefly before looking away. \u201cNo one anymore. They couldn\u2019t make it after all, so it\u2019s just the four of us.\u201d</p><p>Katherine was both relieved and nervous.</p><p>When they pulled into the driveway she was immediately happy she\u2019d come. She\u2019d never seen a house more breathtaking. It was three stories of light gray paint with white trim and she counted at least two separate chimneys rising from opposite ends of the house.</p><p>Cooper parked the Jeep in the large three car garage. The first level had been converted into a huge game room. There was a pool table, foosball, pinball machine and a big screen TV with three separate gaming systems.</p><p>\u201cThis is amazing,\u201d Taylor said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Cooper replied politely and then glanced toward Katherine.</p><p>Cooper led them upstairs to the second level, where sunlight streamed in from every angle. Katherine immediately realized why there were so many windows. Views of the lake greeted her from each one. A balcony spanned the entire length of the second floor.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d Katherine asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Cooper responded and then watched as Katherine stepped outside and breathed in the crisp, winter air.</p><p>She noticed a matching boathouse down below and smiled. It was perfectly charming. Katherine shivered and instantly remembered she wasn\u2019t wearing a jacket. She turned back into the warmth of the house and found Cooper in the kitchen making coffee.</p><p>\u201cThere are two bedrooms on this level and three more upstairs. You can look around and take your pick if you want,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She fell in love with the first room she walked into. Large windows lined an entire wall and faced the water. Katherine allowed herself to get lost in the beauty when Taylor bounced in and nearly scared her half to death.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this place amazing? My God,\u201d Taylor commented, her voice giddy and childlike.</p><p>\u201cIt is ridiculous. Did you see the boathouse down there? It matches this house!\u201d Katherine laughed.</p><p>\u201cReally? How cute!\u201d</p><p>The girls headed into the kitchen and the guys talked about driving around on the ice. Katherine interrupted, \u201cCan we really go on the lake? Like, it will hold us and stuff?\u201d She felt dumb for asking, but she didn\u2019t know anything about frozen lakes.</p><p>Cooper looked amused, \u201cOh, California, you\u2019re so LA. The lake is frozen so thick that we could probably drive my Jeep out there if we wanted too. We have snowmobiles in the boathouse. We\u2019ll take them out later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That is so cool.\u201d The whole concept was foreign to her. \u201cI have no idea where I\u2019d find anything completely frozen over back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Danny sassed.</p><p>\u201cI am SO excited!\u201d Taylor squealed. \u201cI love snowmobiling. So.Much.Fun.\u201d She hugged Danny and he twirled her around.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Danny told her softly, but Katherine heard.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d Taylor tilted her head up and gave him a kiss.</p><p>Cooper watched Taylor and Danny with a pained expression. \u201cCalifornia, did I do something wrong? What happened between us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that didn\u2019t take long,\u201d Taylor commented, as she looked at Cooper.</p><p>\u201cWell I can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d Cooper admitted. \u201cIt kills me not to be with you, Katherine. I can\u2019t pretend I\u2019m fine just being your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanny, let\u2019s go downstairs and I\u2019ll kick your butt in pool.\u201d Taylor grabbed his hand and pulled at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather stay and listen to this, though,\u201d Danny half joked.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d She yanked his arm. \u201cGood luck, you two!\u201d Taylor shouted from halfway down the stairs.</p><p>Once they were gone, Katherine looked at Cooper and her heart felt like it weighed a thousand pounds in her chest. \u201cCooper,\u201d she struggled. \u201cI am so sorry for everything. I know I owe you an explanation. It\u2019s just that what I have to tell you is going to sound completely insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I just need to know. I\u2019ve replayed every moment we\u2019ve ever spent together over and over in my mind trying to figure out what I did wrong. I can\u2019t figure out what I did. Please just tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. How could you? You\u2019re amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what happened? Did you meet someone when you were back home over break?\u201d his voice reflected his pain.</p><p>\u201cGod, no,\u201d the thought alone disgusted her. \u201cThere is someone else, though.\u201d She paused when the look on his face nearly crushed her and quickly added, \u201cBut it\u2019s not what you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it Austen?\u201d Cooper started to get agitated. \u201cWho is he anyway?\u201d His jaw clenched and then unclenched with each breath he took. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCooper, please, sit down.

All I want is to be with you and you won\u2019t let me. I try to get close to you and you push me away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is someone else. I know I already told you that...but it gets weird. And just let me finish before you say anything, okay?\u201d She looked at him for confirmation that he would let her speak uninterrupted.</p><p>\u201cI have these dreams. And the same guy keeps showing up in them. I\u2019d never seen him before, but after the first dream, I couldn\u2019t get him out of my head. Remember the night of our first date, when I told you I thought I saw someone?\u201d Cooper nodded his head, remembering. \u201cWell, he had flashed into my mind right then and completely threw me. It was mostly weird because I hadn\u2019t dreamt about him in weeks. After that night, the dreams didn\u2019t stop and they haven\u2019t stopped.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper interrupted with a relieved, yet confused tone, \u201cSo my competition is some guy you dream about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not finished,\u201d Katherine smirked at him.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis guy from my dreams, his name is Austen...and he\u2019s Taylor\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Cooper rolled his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t compete with your best friend\u2019s brother. That\u2019s like written in the girl handbook or something on how to turn best friends into sisters.\u201d</p> <p>Katherine shot him a look, \u201cHello? Still.Not.Finished.\u201d</p><p>Cooper looked at her with puppy dog eyes, \u201cI promise I\u2019ll shut up.\u201d</p><p>Katherine smiled and continued, \u201cSo Austen, Taylor\u2019s brother, he\u2019s dead. He died two years ago.\u201d</p><p>Cooper\u2019s jaw dropped open in surprise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean, he\u2019s dead. I saw his picture when I went to Taylor\u2019s house for Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you got weird after...\u201d</p><p>Katherine watched as Cooper silently put the timeline of her behavior together in his mind.</p><p>\u201cYes. So...he comes to me in my dreams each night. And we, I don\u2019t know...we spend time together. We laugh and play and talk...and...\u201d</p><p>Cooper winced. His body stiffened as he processed the information. \u201cDo you love him?\u201d he asked seriously.</p><p>\u201cBeyond reason,\u201d was the only response Katherine could come up with, although it made her uncomfortable to admit to Cooper. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t say that to hurt you. I just don\u2019t want to lie to you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that. One more thing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d</p><p>Katherine inhaled deeply and gazed at Cooper through misty eyes, \u201cI do. It\u2019s just...different. I can\u2019t explain it, but it\u2019s not the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not talking like you love me like a brother or something, right?\u201d Cooper asked for clarification.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely not like a brother. Cooper, you\u2019re the most amazing guy I\u2019ve ever met, in real life.\u201d</p><p>Overwhelmed, he stated, \u201cI can\u2019t compete with a ghost.\u201d</p><p>His words were so simplistic in their truth that they forced the tears to fall from her eyes, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do? Where do we go from here? I\u2019m in love with you, Katherine Johns.\u201d He reached out and took her hands in his, \u201cI want to be with you and I\u2019ll do whatever it takes.\u201d</p><p>Her heart didn\u2019t know whether to race or break. \u201cI love you, too. I really do. I just don\u2019t know how to be with you both.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her up from the couch and wrapped her in his arms. She sobbed uncontrollably into his chest and soaked his shirt. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t matter what I say. The choice has to be yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Cooper. I know the choice should be easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you should choose me, babe,\u201d he stated and she snickered.</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s just not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wish you would have told me what was going on sooner. I\u2019ve been dying here, kid. Dying. Taylor wouldn\u2019t give me a clue, so I made up ridiculous stories in my head. Did you know that you\u2019re dating Zac Efron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she laughed a little. \u201cI bet our relationship is amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it is. He took you on location with him over break. That\u2019s why you stopped calling. You were too busy travelling the world with your movie star boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life is so glamorous.\u201d She squeezed him and stared into his green eyes. She could barely stomach seeing them in pain. She plopped back down on the couch and he handed her a wad of tissues.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He scooted next to her and tossed his arm around her shoulder. She leaned into him the way she had so many times before. He kissed the top of her head and realized he wasn\u2019t ready to lose this girl. But how do you fight a ghost...and win?</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Katherine was emotionally exhausted and drifted to sleep right away. The rest of the group sat in the living room talking about everything that had transpired between Cooper and Katherine.</p><p>Danny listened to the story as he rubbed his temples. \u201cThat\u2019s stupid. Why wouldn\u2019t she choose you? You\u2019re the only one in this equation still living, bro.\u201d Then he looked at his girlfriend and said, \u201cNo offense, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I agree. Look, my brother wasn\u2019t selfish in that way. He would never put his desires above someone else\u2019s well being.\u201d Taylor paused and reminisced. \u201cI love my brother, but he wouldn\u2019t want this for her...especially since he loves her.\u201d</p><p>She watched Cooper cringe at the mention of the word love.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Donovan?\u201d Danny asked his teammate.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s just pretty surreal. I had imagined a lot of things, but this was never one of them. How am I supposed to compete with this?\u201d</p><p>Taylor noticed the confusion and pain in Cooper\u2019s eyes. It made her sad for him. \u201cI think you just have to give her time, Coop. She can\u2019t live like this forever. Eventually it\u2019s going to have to end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d Cooper\u2019s shoulders relaxed as he let out a breath.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Taylor assured him.</p><p>She remembered the pain of losing her brother like it was yesterday. She wouldn\u2019t wish that type of torture on anyone and she hoped it would be easier for Katherine to let Austen go when the time was right.</p><p>Austen and Brody waited at the shore as Katherine slowly walked up behind them. Austen turned when she was near and bent down to kiss her sweetly. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered in her ear.</p><p>She was so at peace with him. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>They walked along the beach holding hands. Her mind focused on the fingers that were currently intertwined with her own. Energy swirled between them.</p><p>\u201cCooper\u2019s lake house is pretty nice.\u201d</p><p>Katherine nodded in agreement even though she didn\u2019t like it when he brought up Cooper. \u201cSo what are we going to do today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do? I just want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>Since their big talk, their time together had been more carefree and fun. Austen took her places and showed her things she\u2019d never seen before. She got to show him where she grew up and her favorite places in LA. Their relationship felt so intense all the time, they knew the only way to end it was to lighten things up.</p><p>\u201cHmmm, I don\u2019t know? Where should we go? What should we see?\u201d Katherine tapped her finger against her mouth.</p><p>\u201cIs there anywhere you\u2019ve always wanted to go? \u2019Cause I\u2019m loaded, so it\u2019s on me.\u201d Austen winked.</p><p>Katherine liked when their relationship felt normal, instead of what it truly was. \u201cWell I\u2019ve always wanted to go to Italy. Think you can swing it, ghost boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>He leaned close and confided, \u201cI can swing anything you want, living girlfriend. I\u2019m like magic.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hand and she found herself surrounded by the beauty of Venice.</p><p>\u201cWow. It\u2019s gorgeous here. And so colorful...and so old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re colorful and old,\u201d Austen joked.</p><p>They walked around the city, appreciated the architecture and found bliss in all their surroundings. The city seemed to be filled with people in love at every turn. Venice felt more alive than anywhere Katherine had ever been before.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been here?\u201d she wondered.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, I used to come here with my family every year,\u201d he deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d she was surprised and jealous.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Austen laughed, \u201cThe closest I\u2019ve ever been to Italy was eating in Italian restaurants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a brat.\u201d She pushed him slightly.</p><p>\u201cTakes one to know one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Are you five?\u201d</p><p>She woke suddenly to the morning light streaming through the windows and into her room. She was always surprised at how quickly real time passed while she dreamed. She looked out at the frozen lake and marveled at its beauty.</p><p>The smell of bacon and coffee wafted in from the kitchen. She pulled herself out of bed and walked to where Cooper was cooking. \u201cCan I help?\u201d she offered.</p><p>He turned to face her and she noticed that his eyes looked different. She wondered if he had cried and couldn\u2019t stand the thought. \u201cWant to set the table?\u201d he pointed toward a stack of plates and silverware set neatly on the counter.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Course,\u201d she grabbed the pile and placed them down one by one. She looked back at Cooper. He was so strong and muscular that it was hard to look away. She thought about how cute he looked in his jeans and how his black t-shirt fit him perfectly, accenting all the right curves of his arms and shoulders. He turned around and caught her staring. She felt her cheeks flush with heat.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>She rested the place settings on the table and walked toward him. He set down the spatula and grabbed her. He pulled her tightly against his body and squeezed her close. She timed her breathing with his and felt his lips brush the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d He breathed deeply, his chest pressing into hers. \u201cAs long as it takes. I\u2019ll wait for you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes instantly watered, \u201cI don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d All she could think about was how terribly she\u2019d treated him since Thanksgiving. If he had done that to her she\u2019d hate him for it. At least she\u2019d want to.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d He\u2019d told her that twice now. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at his piercing green eyes and knew without a doubt that he meant every word. \u201cIt might take a while.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to give him false hope. She had no idea how long it would be until she was able to really let go of Austen and walk away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I have anything better to do.\u201d He winked and gently kissed her cheek.</p><p>She smiled, her heart bursting with love for the two incredible guys who had come into her life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcept burn breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, crap.\u201d He grabbed the spatula and quickly turned to the stove where the eggs and pancakes had burned to a crisp. Cooper tossed the smoking pieces of food into the kitchen sink and waved the smoky smell away.</p><p>Taylor bounded down the stairs with Danny close behind. \u201cOh, good Lord, this kid snores like you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d Taylor screeched while she tried to stay away from him.</p><p>\u201cMe? It\u2019s you who snores, woman!\u201d Danny teased and then dove straight to her and tackled her onto the couch. He tickled her as she screamed and swatted at him. Katherine looked up at Cooper who laughed and continued to fix breakfast.</p> <p>\u201cCan we go snowmobiling today?\u201d Taylor asked, as sweetly as she could muster.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d Cooper\u2019s response made her squeal with delight. \u201cBut first, we eat.\u201d He put the last plate of food on the table. He had made eggs, bacon, toast and potatoes.</p><p>\u201cJeez, Cooper, this is amazing. Thank you so much,\u201d Taylor said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Cooper, thank you,\u201d Katherine added.</p><p>Taylor looked at Danny and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever burn breakfast for me, jerk?\u201d</p> <p>Danny stared at her and shook his head. \u201cAlways making me look bad, Donovan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I say, it\u2019s easy.\u201d Cooper sat down across the table from Katherine and glanced at her between bites.</p><p>Katherine couldn\u2019t stop thinking. Her head reminded her that she needed to let go of Austen, but her heart fought the notion every step of the way. A battle raged and she honestly wasn\u2019t sure which side would win.</p><p>After breakfast the girls insisted on washing the dishes while the guys prepped the snowmobiles. Cooper gassed them up, found helmets and goggles for each rider and checked the weather online. When the girls finished, they headed outside in their winter gear and the foursome raced off.</p><p>Katherine loved every minute of this adventure as the machine rumbled beneath her legs. The only thing she could compare it to was being on a jet ski in the summer waves of the Pacific. She drove fast, but wasn\u2019t reckless. She pulled her snowmobile to a stop at a section of the lake that was atypically warmer than other parts. The ice was thinner, but normally still frozen solid.</p><p>She looked around at the snow covered trees that surrounded the lake. The way the white powder sparkled in the sunlight made her smile. She got off the toy she drove and walked softly on the frozen water, taking pictures with each new step. She wanted to share this day with her parents and friends back home.</p> <p>She took some photos as her friends horsed around and she noticed that no matter where she went or what she did, Cooper always had his eyes on her. It made her feel protected.</p><p>She headed back to the snowmobile and scanned through the digital pictures she had just taken. The beauty of it all astounded her.</p><p>Suddenly the ice let out a thunderous howl and started to crack under the weight of the machine. Cooper recognized that sound instantly and turned to yell something at Katherine. Before she had time to figure out what was going on, her body crashed violently into the ice cold water.</p><p>A horrifying sound unlike anything she\u2019d ever spoken tore from her lips. The water was so cold, it felt like a thousand needles stabbed her all at once. Everything seemed to happen in slow motion. She watched as Cooper\u2019s terrified face rushed toward her. She could make her name as it screamed from his lips. Taylor and Danny were even further in the background shouting something she couldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>Katherine instinctively wanted to kick, but the water was so cold, her legs wouldn\u2019t move. She tried to grab the edge of the ice, but she could barely lift her arms. The winter clothing meant to keep her warm suddenly felt like a weighted anchor. Nothing would do what she needed it to. Her body refused to cooperate. She was surprised at how quickly it gave up. Everything betrayed her, even her thoughts. Her brain stopped fighting to keep her alive. It simply wanted to make the cold go away as quickly as possible. Unable to move at all, she went under.</p><p>She was surprised at how peaceful she felt. She turned her head slowly to the left and saw Austen\u2019s image there. He gestured wildly, frantically waving his arms and legs. He screamed at her, or maybe he pleaded; she couldn\u2019t hear a thing he said. She just stared at him with love in her eyes and a small smile on her lips.</p><p>Austen begged her to fight. His mouth screamed at her to swim. But still she did nothing. He fought with his spirit to lift her, carry her, push her, move her, something! But he was powerless to do anything but watch. Terror was written all over his face. He loved Katherine and wanted to be with her, but not like this. He would never put her life in danger. Desperate, he tried one last time to get her to kick.</p><p>Yet she did nothing but watch him. All she could think about was how freezing cold the water was, and how beautiful he looked.</p> <p>A large splash rippled through her vision and Cooper\u2019s face suddenly appeared in front of hers. She looked into his eyes, which were wide with fear, as he grabbed her jacket and yanked her head above the water. His body splayed out over the ice evenly as Danny did the same in the distance. He gripped onto Cooper\u2019s feet as tightly as he could.</p><p>Cooper had to go halfway into the freezing water to reach her and Danny was scared he might fall in, too. They both knew the water this time of year could and would kill you. Cooper screamed at Katherine to kick her legs as he tried to pull her out. She could barely think, let alone move.</p><p>\u201cDanny, pull!!\u201d Cooper yelled at him in a tone he\u2019d never heard before, not even on the rink.</p><p>Taylor was completely freaked out. \u201cIs she okay? Oh my God. Please be okay, please be okay.\u201d Tears streamed down her cheeks. Taylor barely survived the death of her brother. She wasn\u2019t sure she could live through this, too.</p><p>They slowly inched from the break in the ice until Cooper was sure they were safe. He noticed Katherine wasn\u2019t breathing. Cooper was losing his mind, but he went into action. He performed CPR on her while Taylor screamed things in the background. Cooper couldn\u2019t hear anything other than the sound of his heart raging in his ears.</p><p>Katherine still didn\u2019t breathe, but Cooper refused to give up. He pushed on her chest in desperation. \u201cPlease,\u201d he begged her, \u201cdon\u2019t leave me. Not now. Please, Katherine. I just got you back.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly her eyes shot open and she coughed out the water lodged in her lungs. Cooper tilted her head and held her in his arms. She didn\u2019t say a word. He ripped off her soaking wet jacket and carried her to his snowmobile. He had to get the rest of her wet clothing off as well, but he didn\u2019t want to waste any more time. He watched as her lips turned blue and her breathing fell shallow.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s breathing, right?\u201d Taylor didn\u2019t wait for a response. \u201cCooper, is she breathing?\u201d Taylor hysterically asked. Danny ran to her, held her in his arms, and reassured her that it would all be okay.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s breathing. She\u2019s just really cold, Taylor. You guys get home and start a fire and gather all the blankets you can find. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>Danny and Taylor sped off as Cooper leaned Katherine\u2019s frozen body into his. He shivered as he forced his jacket to zip up around them both. Then he drove as fast as he could while he held her tight. He rode the snowmobile as far up to the house as it would go and then he unzipped the jacket, allowing Katherine\u2019s shivering body to slide out. He scooped her into his arms and sprinted up the stairs.</p><p>Cooper looked around at the blazing fire and the pile of comforters. \u201cThis is good. Taylor, you have to get all her clothes off. She can\u2019t have on anything wet. It will only make it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d Taylor asked.</p><p>\u201cThen we start wrapping her in blankets.\u201d</p><p>Taylor did as he instructed and then promptly covered Katherine\u2019s bare skin. \u201cOkay. You can turn around.\u201d</p><p>Cooper walked quickly toward the only girl he loved. He positioned himself on the floor in front of the fire and scooted Katherine\u2019s body into his. He wrapped himself around her and then piled the blankets onto her. Cooper gently rocked her back and forth and listened to her breathing.</p><p>\u201cIs she going to be okay? Do we need to take her to a hospital?\u201d Taylor asked with worry.</p><p>\u201cHer pulse is almost back to normal. Her breathing sounds fine and her color is coming back. When she comes to, we can ask her how she feels. We need to keep an eye on her all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know all of this stuff, Cooper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grew up on this lake. There are rules that come with that. At least, in my house there were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling, Coop?\u201d Danny asked.</p><p>\u201cI feel fine. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He didn\u2019t feel fine, but figured he simply needed to get warmed up too.</p><p>He watched as Katherine\u2019s eyes darted back and forth beneath her eyelids and knew she was dreaming. He assumed she was with Austen. It hurt him more than he had imagined it would to think about. Here he had tried to save her life, and she was most likely out frolicking with her other boyfriend. He gave her a tight squeeze and hoped that if she was in a dream, she\u2019d feel it.</p><p>Katherine sat in the sand while Austen paced back and forth in front of her. His eyes were riddled with worry, fear, devastation, and heartbreak. \u201cDid you see me in the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I saw you. All I could see was you,\u201d she answered calmly.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how hard that was for me? I had to sit there and watch you almost die, Katherine.\u201d Austen was anything but calm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. Why are you so angry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t keep you safe!\u201d Austen threw his head into his hands and pulled at his hair.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t need you to keep me safe!\u201d Katherine fired back. \u201cI never asked you to protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have died today.\u201d He grabbed his chest after saying those words out loud.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cKatherine! I couldn\u2019t live with myself if something happened to you. Watching you in that water\u2014knowing that I could do NOTHING to help you\u2014it almost broke me today. Do you understand that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d died, we\u2019d be together right now. Don\u2019t you want to be with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I want to be with you.\u201d He kneeled down in front of her and took her face in his hands. \u201cBut not like that, Katherine. That cost is too great and it\u2019s not your time. I don\u2019t want to be with you if it means you\u2019re dead too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho made you God?\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me.\u201d He sat in the sand and faced her. \u201cWatching you today was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve ever had to do. I couldn\u2019t save you. I couldn\u2019t do anything to help you. Cooper could. And he did. You have a whole life in front of you. And Cooper, he\u2019s a really good guy and he loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you always make this about Cooper?\u201d she screamed through her tears.</p><p>\u201cBecause it is about him, Katherine. He risked his life to save you.\u201d he paused to look at her face. \u201cAnd you love him too. And that\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t want you to feel bad about loving someone who isn\u2019t me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked into his blue eyes and caressed his soft skin, \u201cIt\u2019s not the same kind of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d he told her, \u201cBut I need you to know that it\u2019s okay. Loving someone else doesn\u2019t take away from what we have. No one can take this from us. It will always be ours.\u201d</p><p>Relief coursed through her veins. She hadn\u2019t realized it before, but maybe she somehow needed his permission to love Cooper. His blessing. His approval. She needed to know that it wouldn\u2019t make him feel any less loved if she loved someone else.</p><p>\u201cWill we ever be together, you and I?\u201d She was desperate for answers that would make the idea of letting him go easier. If she had the promise of futures with Austen, then maybe, just maybe, she could walk away from him in this life.</p> <p>\u201cOh, Katherine Johns, we have many lifetimes to share together. After this one, of course.\u201d He knew what she needed to hear.</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d His words gave her hope.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen them,\u201d he lied, and she smiled.</p><p>Her eyes opened to find those familiar green eyes staring back at her.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p> <p>\u201cHi, favorite eye,\u201d Katherine said to the eye with the speck in it.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m okay.\u201d She noticed the amount of blankets piled on top of her body and quickly tossed a few off.</p><p>\u201cWere you dreaming?\u201d Cooper asked her innocently, with a hint of sadness.</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you with him? I mean, how does it work? Are you with him every time you go to sleep?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot every time, but pretty often. Does it bother you? I mean, now that you know?\u201d She was tired of making everyone around her feel bad, especially Cooper. He had been perfect since the moment she\u2019d met him and he didn\u2019t deserve to be in constant pain because of her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just hard, I guess. I know that if he was alive right now, you\u2019d be in his lap and not mine. I know that if he was physically here...I wouldn\u2019t be. And that thought alone makes my stomach knot up.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and acknowledged he was right. If Austen were alive, she would be with him. Of course she would. Her heart wouldn\u2019t allow her to be with anyone else. Her soul would align itself next to his like a magnet. \u201cBut he\u2019s not here, Cooper. You are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s not enough? What if you never get over him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper. I told you last night that I loved you and I meant it. I know you\u2019re not Austen. And on the flip side of that, Austen\u2019s not you. I don\u2019t want you to be anyone or anything you\u2019re not. I promise you that who you are is more than enough for me.\u201d</p><p>Cooper leaned down and brought her mouth to his. For the first time in months, she was happy it was Cooper\u2019s arms that held her.</p><p>\u201cYou could have died today,\u201d she said with a question in her voice.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cooper answered, very matter of fact.</p> <p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it? I mean, what if you would have fallen in too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t just sit there and watch you drown. I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy body kicked into gear. It was like my instincts were in overdrive and I knew I had to do whatever it took to save you. My brain didn\u2019t stand a chance against my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if you could have stopped yourself, would you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you insane? All I meant was that before I even had a chance to think, I was in the water. Had I let my brain catch up to my body, I still would have done the exact same thing.\u201d He looked at her thoughtfully. \u201cNothing about the person I am would ever let anything happen to you. Not as long as I can help it.\u201d</p><p>At that moment she\u2019d never felt more secure. The fact that he had literally risked his life for hers was something she couldn\u2019t fully process. It was something you had to experience to grasp. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll ever thank you for saving my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably indebted to me forever now. So basically, I think I own you.\u201d</p><p>Katherine laughed. \u201cOwn me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Come on, it\u2019s a fair trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy about you,\u201d he reminded her, but she didn\u2019t need the reminder.</p><p>They were kissing when Taylor walked in. \u201cOh gross, you two. Get a room.\u201d Taylor bent down next to Katherine. \u201cI was so worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m all right. I mean, I feel good right now. But I am kinda hungry.\u201d She glanced at Cooper.</p><p>\u201cIt would be a good idea to get you to stand up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Katherine agreed. At this point, she\u2019d do anything Cooper suggested.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked her, concerned.</p><p>\u201cJust a little light headed and dizzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s normal.\u201d</p><p>Cooper helped Katherine into a chair and then worked on fixing up soup, bread, and pasta.</p><p>Katherine\u2019s mind reeled. She flashed back to her fall through the ice, seeing Austen and then suddenly seeing Cooper. She couldn\u2019t get past what Cooper had done for her today. The accident suddenly forced everything into perspective. Katherine knew she could no longer continue living\u2014if that\u2019s what you called it\u2014in her sleep.</p><p>She had been living to dream. Everything that happened during the day was just one step closer to where she really wanted to be...asleep and with Austen. And while she didn\u2019t fault herself for her actions, she knew it was time to move on. Her chest ached with the realization. But amidst all the pain, she felt a small sliver of relief. And that sliver informed her that she was making the right decision.</p><p>Taylor\u2019s laughter stopped Kat\u2019s daydream. She laughed when she noticed the boys dancing around the kitchen wearing aprons. Sometimes the best dreams happen while you\u2019re wide awake, Katherine thought to herself.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling, California?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cMuch better, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see how much food you just ate?\u201d Danny pointed at Katherine\u2019s empty plate.</p><p>\u201cAlmost dying takes a lot of energy,\u201d she quipped back.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, you\u2019re fine. Thank goodness,\u201d Taylor smiled.</p><p>The girls cleaned up the dinner mess while the guys headed downstairs to play a quick game of pool. Danny creamed him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, man? I never beat you in pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff night, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feeling all right? You don\u2019t necessarily look all right.\u201d Danny asked, concerned.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Nothing a good night\u2019s sleep won\u2019t fix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, bud. I believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more game?\u201d Cooper asked and Danny racked the balls.</p><p>\u201cSo...things seem different between you and Coop,\u201d Taylor noted.</p><p>\u201cToday sort of changed things. I can\u2019t explain it, but I feel different inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike, you and my brother are going to break up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt some point, yeah. I mean, this was a wake-up call. I can\u2019t keep living the way I\u2019ve been living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it must be hard, but you\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I know it\u2019s the right thing to do, but my heart doesn\u2019t like being logical.\u201d Katherine grabbed onto a chair for balance as her eyes rolled back.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. You okay there, cowgirl?\u201d Taylor asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just a little dizzy. Plus, I\u2019m really tired. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing,\u201d Katherine smiled to reassure her friend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get the guys, you go sit down,\u201d Taylor insisted and Katherine obliged.</p><p>Cooper refused to let Katherine out of his sight and in all honesty, she didn\u2019t mind. It was the first time in ages her thoughts were only of him. She didn\u2019t wish or want to be anywhere else.</p><p>She fell asleep on the couch in Cooper\u2019s arms. He refused to let her spend the night alone after the traumatic day she\u2019d had. When she woke up once during the night she smiled as she felt Cooper\u2019s arms still wrapped securely around her.</p><p>They both startled awake to the sound of doors slamming shut and a car speeding away. They thought nothing of it and shook it off.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go get into your bed?\u201d Cooper asked.</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d She started to get up, but Cooper didn\u2019t budge. \u201cCome with me please. I don\u2019t want to sleep alone.\u201d Cooper followed her into the bedroom and they both lay on top of the bed. He pulled the comforter over them as Katherine snuggled into his chest. They fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms.</p><p>Katherine walked down the familiar sandy path toward the silhouette on the bench. The beach was dark and the moon hung in the sky above as if waiting to witness the heartbreak about to come. Austen stood and met her on the pathway. She started to speak, but he stopped her. He pulled her close and sang softly into her ear. They slow danced together by the light of the moon. Tears poured from her eyes and her heart felt like it had dropped to the sand below.</p><p>Austen tried to hold back his own tears, but failed. He knew why she had come and the pain of that realization was too much, even for him.</p><p>She broke the silence. \u201cThis is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He brushed her cheek and more tears fell.</p><p>\u201cIt hurts so much. I need you to know how painful this is.\u201d She placed his hand above her heart. \u201cI know we keep saying it\u2019s the right thing to do, but wouldn\u2019t it be easier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes the right thing to do is the harder thing.\u201d He leaned down to kiss her sweet lips. \u201cI love you, Katherine. I always will.\u201d</p><p>His words almost brought her to her knees. She thought they might give out on her at any moment and she\u2019d tumble to the ground at his feet. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can do this, Austen.\u201d She cried so hard that she had trouble breathing. She clenched at her stomach. \u201cIt hurts.\u201d Her chest felt like it had caved in on her from the inside.</p><p>\u201cI know, babe. I know.\u201d He tried desperately to comfort her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s too much. I can\u2019t do it.\u201d She wept in his arms. \u201cOh, God. I don\u2019t want to live without you.\u201d</p><p>The reality of saying goodbye to him forever was simply too much.</p><p>Austen knew Katherine needed him to be strong. He wiped at his tears and gained control of his voice. \u201cI\u2019ll never leave you. I\u2019ll always be here, Katherine. We can\u2019t keep doing this. You know why you came here tonight. You have to do it.\u201d</p><p>Any sign of weakness and she\u2019d convince them both that leaving was wrong. He was certain it wouldn\u2019t take much effort on her part to make him change his mind.</p><p>She sniffed and let out a quick huff. \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d She looked into his clear blue eyes. \u201cDo we just say goodbye then and walk away like nothing? Like it never mattered or happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that. We both know it was the wrong time for us. But we matter. We will always matter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kissed her again, his lips savoring the taste of hers. He knew it would be their last, so he made it count. There was more passion in that one kiss than in most people have in a lifetime.</p><p>\u201cI will love you until the day I die,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m already dead and I still love you. So I win,\u201d he half smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d He cupped her face again.</p><p>She looked at him with longing and took one last deep breath. \u201cGoodbye, Austen.\u201d</p><p>She gathered up all the courage she could muster and walked down the path, away from the beach. She knew if she didn\u2019t leave now, she never would. Her legs tried to stop walking. Her heart begged her to stay. Her eyes willed her to turn around and look at him one last time. But there was no way she could see his face again and continue to leave. So she continued to stumble forward.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Katherine.\u201d</p><p>Austen stood and watched until she was out of sight. He wanted to run after her, stop her, scream at her to stay. But he knew all he could do was allow her to walk out of his life forever. Once he was sure she was gone, he fell to his knees in heart-wrenching pain and clutched his chest, sobbing her name.</p> <p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Cooper woke to the sound of Katherine\u2019s sobs. She cried in her sleep and tears streamed down her cheeks, soaking her pillow. He wanted to wake her, but he guessed where she was and who she was with. Out of respect, he let her continue sleeping. He watched her shake and cry. It hurt him to see her in such pain and he wanted to make it go away, but knew it wasn\u2019t his place. He thought of her and Austen and assumed they were happy, laughing and loving. It made him sick to think about.</p><p>Then she opened her eyes.</p><p>He watched as she wiped the tears from her face. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to hear her answer.</p><p>She looked at him and steadied her breathing, \u201cI will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I need to go for a walk.\u201d She pushed away from his arms and out of the bed.</p><p>Cooper didn\u2019t want her to wander around outside by herself. What if she was still weak and something happened to her? He started to get up when she stopped him, \u201cI need to be by myself right now, Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you change your mind? About us?\u201d He didn\u2019t know if one night\u2019s dream could change everything that had transpired between them.</p><p>She looked at him softly and reassured his worried heart. \u201cNo. I haven\u2019t changed my mind. But I need to be alone for a bit.\u201d She tried to stifle the sound of her aching heart, but it was obvious to him she was hurting.</p><p>\u201cBring this, please,\u201d Cooper handed her a walkie-talkie.</p><p>She reached out to take the slick black device and rolled her eyes at him.</p><p>\u201cYou never know. You might feel light headed or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, weirdo.\u201d She closed the door behind her and headed into the chilly air.</p> <p>Katherine looked for a place where she could sit and be alone with her thoughts. Being with Cooper so quickly after Austen was painful; she felt like she didn\u2019t deserve either of them. Her heart ached as she grieved. She wanted to fall to her knees and scream at the very idea of never being able to talk to or feel Austen again. Her mind shifted between moments of extreme sadness and sheer happiness as she thought of all that she and Austen had shared. Her perspective altered to one of thankfulness. She knew it was rare to experience what she had and she felt genuinely blessed.</p><p>Peace and silence engulfed her. It was as if she had the entire lake to herself. She silently thanked Austen for all he had given her. She told him she loved him and that no one could ever replace what she felt for him in her heart. Her body filled with warmth as she closed her eyes and let the snow fall on her face.</p><p>Cooper\u2019s image filtered into her thoughts. Thinking about him brought excited chills to her body. He had always deserved her heart and she was finally ready to give it to him. Well, most of it anyway. She would never have her whole heart to give.</p><p>She wiped away the lone teardrop that rested on her cheek and brushed the snow from her pants. With one last thought of Austen, she walked back toward the house...and Cooper. The walkie-talkie clicked and she let Cooper know she was on her way back.</p><p>He met her at the door with a steaming mug of tea. She threw her arms around his neck and kissed him carefully, trying not to spill. \u201cThank you for being so understanding about everything. I really appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>He set the cup down and lifted her up into his arms. \u201cSo you\u2019re still in love with me then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips against hers and kissed her until she could barely breathe. \u201cWe should probably get going. I\u2019ll go find Taylor and Danny.\u201d</p><p>Katherine smiled and thanked him again. She headed into the room where she slept and her things were scattered all over the floor. She didn\u2019t remember leaving it like that. She walked into the bathroom and it was more of the same. Bottles were strewn all across the countertop and along the floor. A confused look spread across her face as she bent down to pick everything up. \u201cMaybe I did this last night and I don\u2019t remember? Weird.\u201d</p><p>Just then Cooper rushed in and asked her if she had seen Taylor or Danny. \u201cNo. Why? Can\u2019t you find them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They aren\u2019t anywhere. Where would they have gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they went for a walk? Did you check outside?\u201d Katherine shrugged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go look now. You didn\u2019t see them when you were out there, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Then she remembered the eerie quiet, \u201cI...didn\u2019t see anyone.\u201d</p><p>Cooper headed out of the bathroom and she heard a door slam. Katherine had a weird feeling that something wasn\u2019t right. She walked into the kitchen and noticed a mess of plates and she searched her memory. Hadn\u2019t they just cleaned the dishes last night after dinner? She swore they had. She heard the downstairs door slam as Cooper ran up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cMy Jeep isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Cooper\u2019s eyes were crazy and for the second time since she\u2019d met him, he looked scared and unsure of himself. \u201cThe Jeep is gone and they aren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is happening and why is it so cold, Cooper? I\u2019m so cold all of a sudden.\u201d He walked over to her and squeezed her tight.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Kat, you\u2019re freezing.\u201d He wrapped as much of his muscular body as he could around her small frame.</p><p>\u201cDo you hear that?\u201d They both stilled.</p><p>\u201cIs that...crying?\u201d Cooper strained to hear.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like it, but where is it coming from?\u201d Katherine ran from room to room, trying to get closer to the sound.</p><p>A faint beeping sound could also be heard. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? I\u2019m scared.\u201d She looked at Cooper and his face was chalky. \u201cCooper, your face. It\u2019s so pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He lifted his hand to touch his face, and collapsed to the ground.</p><p>Katherine screamed. She knelt next to his lifeless body and tried to shake him awake. She cried and screamed his name, but he wouldn\u2019t come to. She put her head on his chest and sobbed, \u201cCooper, please wake up. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dying.\u201d The voice cut through her cries like a knife. Her heart flipped out of her chest as she turned to see Austen standing above her. He didn\u2019t look like himself and he didn\u2019t seem happy to see her.</p><p>\u201cAusten. What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s wrong with Cooper?\u201d She looked down to see Cooper again, but he was gone.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d he go?\u201d She screamed out his name, \u201cCooper? Cooper!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s dying, Katherine. And so are you.\u201d Austen spoke the words carefully and slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What do you mean? We survived the fall in the ice,\u201d she struggled to recall. \u201cDidn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first, yes. But something happened to you both last night. Taylor and Danny drove you to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I felt fine.\u201d She tried to put the pieces together. She replayed the events of the night and the day. Some thoughts were a blur, but others were crystal clear. \u201cWhat about everything else then? Was it all a dream or did it really happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, did you really tell me goodbye?\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her feet before answering. \u201cYes. Was that real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. But everything else...well, let\u2019s just say you\u2019re not awake right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean not awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re unconscious, Katherine.\u201d Austen maintained his composure as he spoke every word to her without emotion.</p><p>\u201cUnconscious? Like, a coma?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper too?\u201d she asked half-crazed.</p><p>\u201cCooper too.\u201d</p><p>It was difficult for Katherine to see Austen and not be with him, but she had to force those thoughts from her mind. Her concern was more for Cooper than it was for herself and she had to focus on how to save him.</p><p>\u201cAusten. We have to help him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure we can.\u201d</p><p>The way he spoke irritated her. \u201cAusten!\u201d She got angry. \u201cI\u2019ve already lost you. I can\u2019t lose Cooper too. I won\u2019t be able to live through it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m not sure what I can do, but I\u2019ll do whatever I can.\u201d</p><p>The crying got louder. \u201cWhat...is that?\u201d Katherine closed her eyes tightly and when she opened them, she was in a hospital room looking down at her own body. Taylor sobbed as she held Kat\u2019s limp hand. \u201cOh, Tay. I\u2019m right here. Taylor!\u201d Katherine yelled at her friend, but Taylor remained unmoved.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t hear you.\u201d Austen refused to leave her side.</p><p>\u201cWhere did Cooper go? What happened to him? He was with me and now he\u2019s gone.\u201d Katherine knew what she and Cooper had shared was real. Even if it was only in a dream, it still happened. She had to find him. She ran out of her room and yelled for him down the hospital corridor.</p><p>\u201cCooper! Cooper where are you?\u201d She clumsily crashed into every hospital room door looking for his body.</p><p>\u201cKatherine?\u201d She heard him yell her name, but he sounded so far away.</p><p>Austen stopped following her and stood at a distance to watch. \u201cKatherine!\u201d Cooper continued to yell until he was close enough for her to respond. He rounded a corner and practically ran into her. \u201cThere you are! How did we get here? Did something happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper.\u201d Katherine searched for the words to explain it to him. \u201cWe\u2019re not okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean we\u2019re not okay? You\u2019re dumping me already?\u201d He half smirked at her.</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, we\u2019re like physically, not okay. We\u2019re in this hospital because you and I are here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know we\u2019re here. I can see we\u2019re here. But WHY are we here?\u201d</p><p>Austen interjected. \u201cShe means that you\u2019re both here, in comas.\u201d</p><p>Cooper looked at Austen. \u201cAusten?\u201d He glanced at Katherine and then back at Austen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Austen responded as good-naturedly as he could through his concern.</p><p>\u201cWell, this can\u2019t be good. If I\u2019m seeing a dead guy, then something\u2019s definitely wrong with me.\u201d Cooper tried to laugh, but he started to worry.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to tell you.\u201d Katherine took Cooper\u2019s hand and walked him toward Austen. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you two met.\u201d</p><p>They shook hands and for some unexplained reason, Austen felt familiar to Cooper. \u201cSo what\u2019s going on? Why are we in comas?\u201d Cooper directed his question toward Austen.</p> <p>\u201cYou both had after-effects from being submerged in the freezing water. Katherine\u2019s brain was affected from the lack of oxygen.\u201d He looked at her and then turned back to Cooper. \u201cYour condition is...different. The damage is in your chest, which wouldn\u2019t normally put you into a coma, but it affected your heart and your ability to breathe properly. And voila, here you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, who found us? I mean, how did we end up here in the hospital?\u201d Cooper struggled to put the pieces of the puzzle together.</p><p>\u201cTaylor found you on the couch when she came down to get water from the kitchen. She wouldn\u2019t have thought anything of it, but she could hear the way you were breathing and it was like each breath took all of your effort. And you were both so pale. She tried to wake you, but neither of you would come to. She panicked. But rightly so.\u201d</p><p>Cooper and Katherine both remembered the sound of the doors slamming and the car driving away.</p><p>\u201cSo, how do we wake up? I\u2019m ready to get my body back.\u201d Cooper wondered.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that. Trust me.\u201d Austen remembered back to the day of his accident. \u201cI wanted to hop back into my body so bad and wake up, but I couldn\u2019t. I kept trying, but nothing worked. I guess sometimes life has other plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, we just sit here forever?\u201d Cooper looked at Katherine, whose hand he still held. \u201cNot that I\u2019d mind spending forever with you, Kat, it\u2019s just that I\u2019d rather do it alive.\u201d He shot a glance toward Austen. \u201cNo offense.\u201d</p><p>Austen smiled, \u201cNone taken. I\u2019d rather be alive too. Especially if it meant one more day with her.\u201d He looked at Katherine with softened eyes.</p><p>Katherine started to feel weak. \u201cGuys, I don\u2019t feel well.\u201d She started to lose her balance and Cooper realized that he was literally holding her up.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with her.\u201d Cooper panicked and looked at Austen. Katherine passed out in his arms and disappeared.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d They ran toward Kat\u2019s hospital room. Taylor still held her hand, but Katherine\u2019s spirit was nowhere to be found.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019d she go? Where is she?\u201d Cooper was like a wild animal.</p><p>Austen shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>The machines hooked to Katherine\u2019s body suddenly started beeping and making noise. Taylor looked up at them and nurses filled the room. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to step out please,\u201d the nurse told Taylor.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Danny heard Taylor\u2019s voice from down the hall and ran to find her. \u201cOh, Danny, something\u2019s wrong.\u201d Taylor could barely stand being in a hospital since the death of her brother.</p><p>Danny comforted her and kissed her head. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be okay. She\u2019ll pull through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate hospitals.\u201d</p><p>Katherine suddenly appeared. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d Cooper asked her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. One minute I was with you and then suddenly I was gone. But I can\u2019t remember where I went.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat happens sometimes,\u201d Austen reassured her. \u201cHow do you feel now?\u201d</p><p>She took a moment to search for the answer and find the words. \u201cStrong, like I want to fight.\u201d</p><p>Austen smiled, \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>Cooper was confused. \u201cSorry, but can someone explain to me what this all means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer body wants to fight and her spirit can feel that. The strength is a good thing. It means she hasn\u2019t given up on living.\u201d Austen looked at her with loving approval.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel that way,\u201d Cooper admitted quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t feel that way? How do you feel?\u201d Katherine was anxious.</p><p>\u201cWeak. And confused.\u201d</p><p>Katherine\u2019s eyes widened and her gaze darted between the boys. She clutched at Austen and pleaded, \u201cAusten, what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to find your body, Cooper. You\u2019re losing the battle. Come on.\u201d The three of them ran down a long white corridor and into the room where Danny sat vigil at Cooper\u2019s bedside. Cooper looked down at his lifeless body in the hospital bed and felt nauseous.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to die, so why do I feel like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your body, Cooper. It\u2019s fighting with your mind. But you can win. You just can\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>Color came back in Katherine\u2019s face and she appeared to glow. Both boys stared at her, each one deeply in love.</p><p>\u201cI feel weird, you guys. Like I\u2019m being pulled away from here...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your body, Katherine. It\u2019s calling for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo die?\u201d she asked, horrified.</p><p>Austen laughed, \u201cNo, my love. To live. It\u2019s time for you to wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to leave you!\u201d She looked at both of them.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019ll always be here,\u201d Austen reminded her.</p><p>Cooper grabbed her hands. He looked in her eyes and said, \u201cYou have to go. Go wake up, Katherine. I\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said you feel weak. That\u2019s a bad sign,\u201d she pleaded emotionally. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you. I\u2019m not waking up if you\u2019re not waking up, Cooper.\u201d</p><p>Austen became agitated.</p><p>\u201cI feel better now. Much stronger,\u201d Cooper lied with a smile on his face. \u201cNow you go and open your eyes first. One of us has to wake up first.\u201d</p><p>She refused to move or let go of Cooper\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cKatherine.\u201d She turned to look at Austen. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of him. I won\u2019t leave his side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>She walked to Austen and hugged him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow go.\u201d He tried to reassure her with his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you both so much,\u201d was the last thing she remembered before her eyes opened. She found herself looking right at Taylor\u2019s sobbing face.</p><p>\u201cKatherine! Oh, God!\u201d Taylor hugged her and yelled for the nurse.</p><p>\u201cCooper?\u201d was the first word she muttered.</p><p>Taylor couldn\u2019t hide the look on her face. \u201cKatherine, Cooper\u2019s...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in a coma, I know.\u201d</p><p>Taylor was shocked. \u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, but listen,\u201d Katherine moved to get up. \u201cWe have to go get him now. He should be waking up and I have to be there when he opens his eyes.\u201d</p><p>Taylor held Katherine down in her bed. \u201cWhat are you talking about? You can\u2019t move, Katherine. You need to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me to wake up first, and I did. Now it\u2019s his turn to wake up. Let me go!\u201d</p><p>Taylor fought to keep Katherine still when Danny walked into the room. \u201cDanny! He\u2019s awake right? I woke up first so he woke up too, right?\u201d</p><p>Danny looked at both girls before shaking his head. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t woken up yet, Kat. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be right. They both said he\u2019d wake up after me.\u201d Katherine said things that didn\u2019t make sense to Taylor or Danny. They told Kat they\u2019d be right back and they stepped outside her room.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Taylor could see the bad news written all over Danny\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor said he just fell even deeper into his coma.\u201d</p><p>Taylor\u2019s eyes welled up with tears. \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t tell Katherine that; it will break her.\u201d Taylor tried to plan. \u201cYou should go back with Cooper and I\u2019ll stay here with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I love you.\u201d He kissed her cheek and walked away.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Austen exhaled when Katherine opened her eyes, \u201cShe actually listened.\u201d</p><p>Cooper looked at him and smiled. \u201cThanks for your help. There\u2019s no way I could have gotten her to do that without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said with understanding.</p><p>Cooper looked at Austen before asking, \u201cDo we know each other? I know that sounds crazy, it\u2019s just that you seem familiar to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not crazy. We may have met once or twice before.\u201d Austen thought back to a time and place long before the one they were currently in when Cooper Donovan was his best friend.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Seems that way,\u201d Cooper was too distracted to ask any more questions and he took Austen\u2019s answer without reservation.</p><p>\u201cNow, tell me how you\u2019re really feeling.\u201d</p><p>Cooper looked at him, \u201cPretty weak, honestly. I don\u2019t understand, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m a pretty strong guy, so for my body to give out on me so quickly...it doesn\u2019t add up.\u201d</p><p>Austen agreed that it made little sense. \u201cI don\u2019t have all the answers, Cooper. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do now?\u201d</p><p>Neither wanted to leave Katherine\u2019s bedside, but Cooper\u2019s weakness grew. They knew they couldn\u2019t avoid that reality for long.</p><p>\u201cWe sit here with her. For now,\u201d Austen replied.</p><p>They watched Katherine cry for Cooper and talk out loud about Austen. Taylor listened, but had given up trying to figure out what Katherine meant while was still in this state. From time to time, Katherine would scream Cooper\u2019s name and start crying. It caused Austen and Cooper so much pain. They would run to her side to calm her, but she couldn\u2019t hear them.</p><p>\u201cDoes she know we\u2019re here? How does it work when you do it? How does she hear you?\u201d Cooper wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cFor us, it only worked while she was sleeping.\u201d</p><p>Cooper cut him off, \u201cBut that\u2019s not true. She saw you once before when we were together. Or maybe more than once, I can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s because her guard was down. When she\u2019s not trying so hard to see or feel me, that\u2019s when I can get in. Otherwise, she\u2019s amazing at blocking me out.\u201d</p><p>They both smiled. \u201cSo she can\u2019t see us right now?\u201d Cooper wondered.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re certain she can\u2019t hear us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d bet money on it,\u201d Austen added.</p><p>Katherine drifted in and out of sleep. Taylor worried she\u2019d fall back into a coma, but the doctors assured her that this was normal sleep behavior after a trauma. Every so often Kat was certain she could hear Cooper and Austen talk to each other. But when she tried to listen, the voices would disappear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cooper was surprised at how comfortable it was to be around Austen. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I hate you? I mean, shouldn\u2019t we hate each other?\u201d Cooper asked out loud, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cI definitely shouldn\u2019t hate you. I mean, I\u2019m the one who\u2019s dead, so how selfish would that be?\u201d Austen responded.</p><p>Cooper nodded his head in agreement, \u201cPretty selfish. I thought I would want to punch you in the face or something, but I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for not busting up the goods.\u201d Austen laughed as he grabbed at his chin.</p> <p>\u201cWeird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Austen asked.</p><p>\u201cThis whole thing. I don\u2019t know. How I feel. How I felt before I met you. The fact that I\u2019m meeting you. Can I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Austen knew he had no right to feel anything but gratitude toward Cooper Donovan. He knew that Cooper had saved the love of his life. He also knew that Cooper was the only guy he could see loving her after he was gone. It was just like the last time.</p><p>\u201cIs it hard for you?\u201d Cooper wondered.</p> <p>\u201cTo what? See you and Katherine together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Austen paused before answering. \u201cYes and no.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cI mean...I love her more than I can put into words, so all I want is for her to be happy. And if it\u2019s not going to be me in her life, I\u2019m really happy that it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>Cooper was surprised at Austen\u2019s response. \u201cThanks. That means a lot,\u201d he said, relieved.</p><p>\u201cIs it hard for you?\u201d Austen was curious.</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d Cooper nodded. \u201cAll I knew was that every time she went to sleep, she was with someone I could never compete with. That realization was the hardest, I think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you know how much she loves you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI also know it\u2019s not the same,\u201d Cooper spoke without disdain.</p><p>Austen nodded. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t have to be the same for it to mean the world to her. She loves you in ways she doesn\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can feel it. And I see the way she looks at you.\u201d</p><p>Cooper felt the blood rush out of his body. \u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper!\u201d Austen yelled, but it was too late.</p><p>Katherine woke and popped up in her bed. \u201cTaylor. We need to go to Cooper right now. RIGHT NOW!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I have a bad feeling. Take me there now, Taylor!\u201d Kat threw back the covers and pushed at Taylor, not sure if she were trying to help her out of bed, or keep her in it.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Come on.\u201d Taylor helped Kat get out of bed and they rushed toward Cooper\u2019s room. Austen watched, unseen, from the hallway. Danny stopped the girls at the door.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go in there, Kat,\u201d Danny insisted, as he grabbed her arms and held her tightly.</p><p>She struggled and tried to push her way through the hockey player. \u201cLet me in there, Danny! Cooper! Cooper, don\u2019t you leave me!\u201d she cried from the hallway.</p><p>A nurse walked by and admonished, \u201cYou have to keep it down, miss. Please.\u201d She turned to Taylor. \u201cAnd you really need to get her back to her room! She shouldn\u2019t be out of bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCooper!\u201d Kat\u2019s knees buckled under her weight. She heard the solid beep coming from the machine and knew what that sound meant. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me! You promised you wouldn\u2019t leave me. Wake up! Cooper!\u201d</p><p>Austen crouched behind her and held her in his arms. She couldn\u2019t feel him, but he didn\u2019t care. \u201cDammit, Cooper, where are you? I know you\u2019re here! Cooper!\u201d Austen yelled for him. He started running through the hallways looking for him. He shouted Cooper\u2019s name around every corner. He had to be somewhere close and Austen was determined to find him. \u201cCome on, Cooper, where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAusten.\u201d The voice was so weak he barely heard it. Austen looked down and saw Cooper sitting on the floor. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dying.\u201d Austen spoke the words void of any emotion.</p><p>Cooper understood what happened and accepted it. He closed his eyes before Austen grabbed him and shook him. \u201cSnap out of it, hockey boy!\u201d</p><p>Cooper glared at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now YOU\u2019RE my problem.\u201d</p><p>Cooper tried to stand, but couldn\u2019t. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to fight! I know it\u2019s easier to give in. I know everything in you is telling you to do just that. But you have to fight it, Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d Austen grabbed him by the shirt and dragged him outside the hospital room where Katherine screamed and cried for him. \u201cIf I had a second chance, I\u2019d give anything to be with that girl. And you still can. Don\u2019t quit on her! She would never quit on you!\u201d Austen\u2019s eyes burned with rage and sorrow.</p><p>Seeing her and hearing Austen\u2019s words lit a fire in his soul. \u201cHow do I do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d Austen got down in Cooper\u2019s face. \u201cYou fight. When you feel that peaceful weakness...and your body begs you to give in to it, you don\u2019t let it win.You have to stay strong. Use everything in your power to fight through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t?\u201d Cooper concentrated on breathing.</p><p>\u201cYou can! And you will. It won\u2019t be easy, but you have to fight, Cooper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you help me?\u201d Cooper didn\u2019t think he could do it alone.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Austen reached out a hand and helped Cooper to his feet.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel that?\u201d Austen asked, sensing the pull on Cooper\u2019s soul.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the feeling you fight. Walk away from it. Don\u2019t give in.\u201d Austen was firm.</p><p>\u201cIt feels like it would be so much easier to not fight. It\u2019s peaceful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it would be easier. It would be quitting! Look at Katherine, Cooper. Look at her. It will break her if you don\u2019t pull through.\u201d Austen knew she would be the only thing that could get him through this. He had to make sure Cooper concentrated on her and remembered why he wanted to be alive.</p><p>Cooper watched as the doctors frantically pounded on his chest, and he touched his own to see if he felt pain but there was none. Austen reminded him not give in and shouted Katherine\u2019s name.</p><p>Suddenly, Cooper started to feel stronger and the machines\u2019 beeping was slower and less strident. The medical staff congratulated each other in relief as Katherine rushed into the room and leaned over to plant kisses on his face. \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn to wake up, Cooper. You told me to wake up first, and I did. So now it\u2019s your turn.\u201d She turned and looked up at the ceiling before saying, \u201cYou said you\u2019d help, Austen. You promised.\u201d</p><p>Cooper squeezed his eyes shut as hard as he could, but when he opened them he could still see Austen. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work?\u201d he asked, confused.</p><p>Austen smiled. \u201cIt worked. You\u2019re still alive. You\u2019re just not awake yet. We\u2019ll get you there.\u201d</p><p>Cooper felt his strength grow. \u201cThank you Austen. For everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do the same for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think so.\u201d</p><p>Taylor walked Kat back to her room and insisted she rest. Katherine climbed back into her own bed and fell asleep quickly with the help of a sedative. She found herself in Cooper\u2019s room with both of her loves.</p><p>\u201cAusten! Cooper! What\u2019s going on, why aren\u2019t you awake yet?\u201d</p><p>Austen hugged her and told her that things were taking a little longer than he had hoped. \u201cCooper\u2019s body isn\u2019t taking him back that easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...make it!\u201d she insisted stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, babe. I really am,\u201d Cooper told her.</p><p>\u201cYou almost died. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I wouldn\u2019t have made it without Austen.\u201d Katherine turned to look at Austen before mouthing the words \u2018thank you\u2019 to him.</p><p>She squeezed Cooper and reminded him, \u201cYou promised you\u2019d wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do it, already!\u201d she demanded.</p><p>She looked around and saw she was alone in an empty room. Neither Cooper nor Austen were there, but she could still hear them talking. She yelled for them, but it was clear they couldn\u2019t hear her. She ran around trying to find them, but no matter where she ran, the voices never got any closer.</p><p>So she stopped running and listened. \u201cI keep feeling stronger,\u201d Cooper explained to Austen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good. You should be able to go back soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve always done. Watch over the people I care about and wait for them to join me here.\u201d His gaze met Cooper\u2019s. \u201cBut not for a long time,\u201d he reassured him.</p><p>Cooper nodded his head. \u201cWill you still dream with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t she tell you?\u201d Austen asked. \u201cOh, right. You don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatherine told me goodbye. We\u2019re not going to see each other any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201d Cooper was shocked.</p><p>Austen laughed. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t think you guys should do that. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not what she truly wants. And I\u2019m fairly certain it\u2019s not what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both know it\u2019s for the best. She wasn\u2019t free to truly live her life or be with you as long as I was a distraction.\u201d</p><p>Cooper understood. \u201cLook, I just think there ought to be some sort of middle ground or something? Can you honestly tell me you have the strength to stay out of her life forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never promise that.\u201d Austen didn\u2019t see the point in lying.</p><p>\u201cWell. I just want you to know that I\u2019m okay with you seeing her. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019d rather she not fall head over heels for you again and ditch me,\u201d he laughed, \u201cbut if there\u2019s a way for you to still talk to her when she needs you or something, I think it would good for both of you...for all of us.\u201d</p><p>Austen had been right about Cooper Donovan. If he couldn\u2019t be with Katherine, then Cooper was definitely the right guy for her. \u201cThank you, Cooper. That really means a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for everything you\u2019ve done. You\u2019re a hell of a guy. I understand why this was so hard for her.\u201d He reached out and they shook hands like friends.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel that?\u201d Austen sensed the change.</p><p>\u201cIs it time to go?\u201d</p><p>They walked side by side toward Cooper\u2019s room where his body lay. The moment Cooper got near it, he felt the pull. \u201cI think I can go back now.\u201d</p><p>Austen nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s time. Next time you open your eyes, you should be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ll take good care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Cooper opened his eyes and saw Danny sleeping awkwardly in the chair next to him. \u201cWake up, man.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Danny moved at the sound and stood up when he saw Cooper\u2019s eyes were open. \u201cOh man.

Sorry about that.\u201d Cooper half smiled.</p><p>Katherine heard familiar footsteps heading toward her. She sat in the corridor with tears rolling down her face. Austen sat down next to her and kissed her cheek. \u201cDid you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery word.\u201d She smiled at him.</p> <p>\u201cSo then. I guess I\u2019ll be seeing you around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so,\u201d she responded with happiness.</p><p>Austen stood up to leave. \u201cAusten?\u201d He stopped. \u201cThank you so much...for saving Cooper\u2019s life...for making mine worth living...for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. And thank you for loving me.\u201d</p><p>As he walked away, she opened her eyes.</p> <p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Katherine sat at the foot of Cooper\u2019s bed and waited for him to wake up. Danny and Taylor headed back to the lake house to get some real sleep and pack up their things. Cooper started to stir and he accidentally kicked her.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, as he opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cCooper!\u201d She leaned down to kiss his cheek.</p><p>\u201cHey there, California,\u201d he smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re okay.\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe she had almost lost him.</p> <p>\u201cMe too. What a crazy day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure if he remembered anything or not.</p><p>But when Cooper said, \u201cThat Austen is one really great guy,\u201d she knew he remembered everything.</p><p>\u201cSo are you, Cooper Donovan.\u201d</p><p>...Two Months Later ...</p><p>Cooper skated around the ice as if he had never had to battle for his life. He led his team to the state championships and broke the school record for goals scored in a single game. Katherine cheered like crazy from her seat next to Taylor.</p><p>The girls waited for the guys to get out of the locker room and Katherine marveled at how perfect her life had turned out. The locker room door opened and out walked her handsome hockey star. He threw his arms around her and kissed her head. \u201cI\u2019m starving. Please tell me you\u2019ll feed me, woman.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know, you were kind of a showoff tonight on the ice. It\u2019s really rude.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRude?\u201d he mocked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. There\u2019s a whole team out there, Donovan, geez. Not like you have to go breaking records all on your own. You could let other guys on the team feel like their presence is at least necessary. See? Rude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you rude.\u201d He picked her up and swung her around while other couples looked on.</p><p>The entire campus knew what happened that weekend at the lake house, but no one ever mentioned it, at least not directly to them. There were articles about it in various papers and the college had published in-depth interviews with both Katherine and Cooper. But no one other than Taylor and Danny knew the whole truth, the truth that included what Austen had done.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Katherine Johns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you, Cooper Donovan.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her as Austen\u2019s image popped into her mind. She didn\u2019t flinch or pull away. She simply thought of Austen with love. He smiled at her and her heart felt warm and full.</p><p>\u201cEverything all right?\u201d Cooper asked, as he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d she said, touching the side of his face.</p><p>\u201cTell Austen \u2018hi\u2019 for me,\u201d he said, and winked at her.</p><p>Her mouth fell open in surprise, and she asked, \u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her as they walked hand in hand toward Dom\u2019s restaurant as Danny and Taylor followed close behind.</p><p>The End </p> </body></html>"]
