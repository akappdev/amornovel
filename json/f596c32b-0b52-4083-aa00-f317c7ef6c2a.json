And then she heard and felt a thump as the right rear wheel of her BMW slipped off the road onto the shoulder and sank into the mud. The car rocked to a stop. She accelerated and heard the wheel spin but she was going nowhere fast. I am so screwed, was her next thought.</p><p>She turned on the dome light and looked at her cell phone. She\u2019d lost the signal an hour ago when she left the freeway and headed up into the mountains. In fact, she\u2019d been having a pretty lively discussion with her sister Joey when the steep hills and unbelievably tall trees blocked the signal and cut them off.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you\u2019re really doing this,\u201d Joey was saying. \u201cI thought you\u2019d come to your senses. This isn\u2019t you, Mel! You\u2019re not a small-town girl!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah? Well, it looks like I\u2019m gonna be\u2014I took the job and sold everything, so I wouldn\u2019t be tempted to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t just take a leave of absence? Maybe go to a small, private hospital? Try to think this through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need everything to be different,\u201d Mel said. \u201cNo more hospital war zone. I\u2019m just guessing, but I imagine I won\u2019t be called on to deliver a lot of crack babies out here in the woods. The woman said this place, this Virgin River, is calm and quiet and safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd stuck back in the forest, a million miles from a Starbucks, where you\u2019ll get paid in eggs and pig\u2019s feet and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd none of my patients will be brought in handcuffed, guarded by a corrections officer.\u201d Then Mel took a breath and, unexpectedly, laughed and said, \u201cPig\u2019s feet?</p> <p>Oh-oh, Joey\u2014I\u2019m going up into the trees again, I might lose you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wait. You\u2019ll be sorry. You\u2019ll regret this. This is crazy and impetuous and\u2014\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when the signal, blessedly, was lost. And Joey was right\u2014with every additional mile, Mel was doubting herself and her decision to escape into the country. At every curve the roads had become narrower and the rain a little harder. It was only 6:00 p.m., but it was already dark as pitch; the trees were so dense and tall that even that last bit of afternoon sun had been blocked. Of course there were no lights of any kind along this winding stretch. According to the directions, she should be getting close to the house where she was to meet her new employer, but she didn\u2019t dare get out of her swamped car and walk. She could get lost in these woods and never be seen again.</p><p>Instead, she fished the pictures from her briefcase in an attempt to remind herself of a few of the reasons why she had taken this job. She had pictures of a quaint little hamlet of clapboard houses with front porches and dormer windows, an old-fashioned schoolhouse, a steepled church, hollyhocks, rhododendrons and blossoming apple trees in full glory, not to mention the green pastures upon which livestock grazed. There was the Pie and Coffee shop, the Corner Store, a tiny-one-room, freestanding library, and the adorable little cabin in the woods that would be hers, rent free, for the year of her contract.</p><p>The town backed up to the amazing sequoia redwoods and national forests that spanned hundreds of miles of wilderness over the Trinity and Shasta mountain ranges. The Virgin River, after which the town was named, was deep, wide, long, and home to huge salmon, sturgeon, steel fish and trout. She\u2019d looked on the Internet at pictures of that part of the world and was easily convinced no more beautiful land existed. Of course, she could see nothing now except rain, mud and darkness. Ready to get out of LosAngeles, she had put her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with the Nurse\u2019s Registry and one of the recruiters brought Virgin River to her attention. The town doctor, she said, was getting old and needed help. A woman from the town, Hope McCrea, was donating the cabin and the first year\u2019s salary. The county was picking up the tab for liability insurance for at least a year to get a practitioner and midwife in this remote, rural part of the world. \u201cI faxed Mrs. McCrea your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and letters of recommendation,\u201d the recruiter had said, \u201cand she wants you. Maybe you should go up there and look the place over.\u201d</p><p>Mel took Mrs. McCrea\u2019s phone number and called her that evening. Virgin River was far smaller than what she\u2019d had in mind, but after no more than an hour-long conversation with Mrs. McCrea, Mel began effecting her move out of L.A. the very next morning. That was barely two weeks ago.</p> <p>What they didn\u2019t know at the Registry, nor in Virgin River for that matter, was that Mel had become desperate to get away. Far away. She\u2019d been dreaming of a fresh start, and peace and quiet, for months. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d had a restful night\u2019s sleep. The dangers of the big city, where crime seemed to be overrunning the neighborhoods, had begun to consume her. Just going to the bank and the store filled her with anxiety; danger seemed to be lurking everywhere. Her work in the three-thousand-bed county hospital and trauma center brought to her care the victims of too many crimes, not to mention the perpetrators of crimes hurt in pursuit or arrest\u2014strapped to hospital beds in wards and in Emergency, guarded by cops. What was left of her spirit was hurting and wounded. And that was nothing to the loneliness of her empty bed.</p><p>Her friends begged her to stave off this impulse to run for some unknown small town, but she\u2019d been in grief group, individual counseling and had seen more of the inside of a church in the last nine months than she had in the last ten years, and none of that was helping. The only thing that gave her any peace of mind was fantasizing about running away to some tiny place in the country where people didn\u2019t have to lock their doors, and the only thing you had to fear were the deer getting in the vegetable garden. It seemed like sheer heaven.</p><p>But now, sitting in her car looking at the pictures by the dome light, she realized how ridiculous she\u2019d been. Mrs. McCrea told her to pack only durable clothes\u2014jeans and boots\u2014for country medicine. So what had she packed? Her boots were Stuart Weitzmans, Cole Haans and Fryes\u2014and she hadn\u2019t minded paying over a tidy fourfifty for each pair. The jeans she had packed for traipsing out to the ranches and farms were Rock &amp; Republics, Joe\u2019s, Luckys, 7 For All Mankind\u2014they rang up between one-fifty and two-fifty a copy. She\u2019d been paying three hundred bucks a pop to have her hair trimmed and highlighted. After scrimping for years through college and postgrad nursing, once she was a nurse practitioner with a very good salary she discovered she loved nice things. She might have spent most of her workday in scrubs, but when she was out of them, she liked looking good.</p><p>She was sure the fish and deer would be very impressed.</p><p>In the past half hour she\u2019d only seen one old truck on the road. Mrs. McCrea hadn\u2019t prepared her for how perilous and steep these roads were, filled with hairpin turns and sharp drop-offs, so narrow in some places that it would be a challenge for two cars to pass each other. She was almost relieved when the dark consumed her, for she could at least see approaching headlights around each tight turn. Her car had sunk into the shoulder on the side of the road that was up against the hill and not the ledge where there were no guardrails. Here she sat, lost in the woods and doomed. With a sigh, she turned around and pulled her heavy coat from the top of one of the boxes on the backseat. She hoped Mrs. McCrea would be traversing this road either en route to or from the house where they were to meet. Otherwise, she would probably be spending the night in the car. She still had a couple of apples, some crackers and two cheese rounds in wax. But the damn Diet Coke was gone\u2014she\u2019d have the shakes and a headache by morning from caffeine withdrawal.</p><p>No Starbucks. She should have done a better job of stocking up. She turned off the engine, but left the lights on in case a car came along the narrow road. If she wasn\u2019t rescued, the battery would be dead by morning. She settled back and closed her eyes. A very familiar face drifted into her mind: Mark. Sometimes the longing to see him one more time, to talk to him for just a little while was overwhelming. Forget the grief\u2014she just missed him\u2014missed having a partner to depend on, to wait up for, to wake up beside. An argument over his long hours even seemed appealing. He told her once, \u201cThis\u2014you and me\u2014this is forever.\u201d</p><p>Forever lasted four years. She was only thirty-two and from now on she would be alone. He was dead. And she was dead inside.</p><p>A sharp tapping on the car window got her attention and she had no idea if she\u2019d actually been asleep or just musing. It was the butt of a flashlight that had made the noise and holding it was an old man. The scowl on his face was so jarring that she thought the end she feared might be upon her.</p> <p>\u201cMissy,\u201d he was saying. \u201cMissy, you\u2019re stuck in the mud.\u201d</p><p>She lowered her window and the mist wet her face. \u201cI...I know. I hit a soft shoulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat piece of crap won\u2019t do you much good around here,\u201d he said. Piece of crap indeed! It was a new BMW convertible, one of her many attempts to ease the ache of loneliness. \u201cWell, no one told me that! But thank you very much for the insight.\u201d</p><p>His thin white hair was plastered to his head and his bushy white eyebrows shot upwards in spikes; the rain glistened on his jacket and dripped off his big nose. \u201cSit tight, I\u2019ll hook the chain around your bumper and pull you out. You going to the McCrea house?\u201d</p><p>Well, that\u2019s what she\u2019d been after\u2014a place where everyone knows everyone else. She wanted to warn him not to scratch the bumper but all she could do was stammer, \u201cYyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t far. You can follow me after I pull you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said.</p><p>So, she would have a bed after all. And if Mrs. McCrea had a heart, there would be something to eat and drink. She began to envision the glowing fire in the cottage with the sound of spattering rain on the roof as she hunkered down into a deep, soft bed with lovely linens and quilts wrapped around her. Safe. Secure. At last. Her car groaned and strained and finally lurched out of the ditch and onto the road. The old man pulled her several feet until she was on solid ground, then he stopped to remove the chain. He tossed it into the back of the truck and motioned for her to follow him. No argument there\u2014if she got stuck again, he\u2019d be right there to pull her out. Along she went, right behind him, using lots of window cleaner with her wipers to keep the mud he splattered from completely obscuring her vision. In less than five minutes, the blinker on the truck was flashing and she followed him as he made a right turn at a mailbox. The drive was short and bumpy, the road full of potholes, but it quickly opened up into a clearing. The truck made a wide circle in the clearing so he could leave again, which left Mel to pull right up to...a hovel!</p><p>This was no adorable little cottage. It was an A-frame with a porch all right, but it looked as though the porch was only attached on one side while the other end had broken away and listed downward. The shingles were black with rain and age and there was a board nailed over one of the windows. It was not lit within or without; there was no friendly curl of smoke coming from the chimney. The pictures were lying on the seat beside her. She blasted on her horn and jumped immediately out of the car, clutching the pictures and pulling the hood of her wool jacket over her head. She ran to the truck. He rolled down his window and looked at her as if she had a screw loose. \u201cAre you sure this is the McCrea cottage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>She showed him the picture of the cute little A-frame cottage with Adirondack chairs on the porch and hanging pots filled with colorful flowers decorating the front of the house. It was bathed in sunlight in the picture.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said. \u201cBeen awhile since she looked like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t told that. She said I could have the house rent free for a year, plus salary. I\u2019m supposed to help out the doctor in this town. But this\u2014?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know the doc needed help. He didn\u2019t hire you, did he?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I was told he was getting too old to keep up with the demands of the town and they needed another doctor, but that I\u2019d do for a year or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p> <p>She raised her voice to be heard above the rain. \u201cI\u2019m a nurse practitioner. And certified nurse midwife.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to amuse him. \u201cThat a fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the doctor?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEverybody knows everybody. Seems like you shoulda come up here and look the place over and meet the doc before making up your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, seems like,\u201d she said in some self-recrimination. \u201cLet me get my purse\u2014give you some money for pulling me out of the\u2014\u201d But he was already waving her off.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t want your money. People up here don\u2019t have money to be throwing around for neighborly help. So,\u201d he said with humor, lifting one of those wild white eyebrows,</p><p>\u201clooks like she got one over on you. That place\u2019s been empty for years now.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cRent free! Hah!\u201d</p><p>Headlights bounced into the clearing as an old Suburban came up the drive. Once it arrived the old man said, \u201cThere she is. Good luck.\u201d And then he laughed. Actually, he cackled as he drove out of the clearing.</p><p>Mel stuffed the picture under her jacket and stood in the rain near her car as the Suburban parked. She could\u2019ve gone to the porch to get out of the elements, but it didn\u2019t look quite safe.</p><p>The Suburban\u2019s frame was jacked up and the tires were huge\u2014no way that thing was getting stuck in the mud. It was pretty well splashed up, but it was still obvious it was an older model. The driver trained the lights on the cottage and left them on as the door opened. Out of the SUV climbed this itty bitty elderly woman with thick, springy white hair and black framed glasses too big for her face. She was wearing rubber boots and was swallowed up by a rain slicker, but she couldn\u2019t have been five feet tall. She pitched a cigarette into the mud and, wearing a huge toothy smile, she approached Mel. \u201cWelcome!\u201d she said gleefully in the same deep, throaty voice Mel recognized from their phone conversation.</p><p>\u201cWelcome?\u201d Mel mimicked. \u201cWelcome?\u201d She pulled the picture from the inside of her jacket and flashed it at the woman. \u201cThis is not that!\u201d</p> <p>Completely unruffled, Mrs. McCrea said, \u201cYeah, the place could use a little sprucing up. I meant to get over here yesterday, but the day got away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSprucing up? Mrs. McCrea, it\u2019s falling down! You said it was adorable! Precious is what you said!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy word,\u201d Mrs. McCrea said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me at the Registry that you were so melodramatic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they didn\u2019t tell me you were delusional!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now, that kind of talk isn\u2019t going to get us anywhere. Do you want to stand in the rain or go inside and see what we have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d frankly like to turn around and drive right out of this place, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d get very far without four-wheel-drive. Another little thing you might\u2019ve mentioned.\u201d</p><p>Without comment, the little white-haired sprite stomped up the three steps and onto the porch of the cabin. She didn\u2019t use a key to unlock the door but had to apply a firm shoulder to get it to open. \u201cSwollen from the rain,\u201d she said in her gravelly voice, then disappeared inside.</p><p>Mel followed, but didn\u2019t stomp on the porch as Mrs. McCrea had. Rather, she tested it gingerly. It had a dangerous slant, but appeared to be solid in front of the door. A light went on inside just as Mel reached the door. Immediately following the dim light came a cloud of choking dust as Mrs. McCrea shook out the tablecloth. It sent Mel back out onto the porch, coughing. Once she recovered, she took a deep breath of the cold, moist air and ventured back inside.</p> <p>Mrs. McCrea seemed to be busy trying to put things right, despite the filth in the place. She was pushing chairs up to the table, blowing dust off lampshades, propping books on the shelf with bookends. Mel had a look around, but only to satisfy her curiosity as to how horrid it was, because there was no way she was staying. There was a faded floral couch, a matching chair and ottoman, an old chest that served as a coffee table and a brick and board bookcase, the boards unfinished. Only a few steps away, divided from the living room by a counter, was the small kitchen. It hadn\u2019t seen a cleaning since the last person made dinner\u2014presumably years ago. The refrigerator and oven doors stood open, as did most of the cupboard doors. The sink was full of pots and dishes; there were stacks of dusty dishes and plenty of cups and glasses in the cupboards, all too dirty to use.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, this is just unacceptable,\u201d Mel said loudly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little dirt is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bird\u2019s nest in the oven!\u201d Mel exclaimed, completely beside herself. Mrs. McCrea clomped into the kitchen in her muddy rubber boots, reached into the open oven door and plucked out the bird\u2019s nest. She went to the front door and pitched it out into the yard. She shoved her glasses up on her nose as she regarded Mel. \u201cNo more bird\u2019s nest,\u201d she said in a voice that suggested Mel was trying her patience.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d make it. That old man in the pickup had to pull me out of the mud just down the road. I can\u2019t stay here, Mrs. McCrea\u2014it\u2019s out of the question. Plus, I\u2019m starving and I don\u2019t have any food with me.\u201d She laughed hollowly. \u201cYou said there would be adequate housing ready for me, and I took you to mean clean and stocked with enough food to get me through a couple of days till I could shop for myself. But this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a contract,\u201d Mrs. McCrea pointed out.</p><p>\u201cSo do you,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you could get anyone to agree this is adequate or ready.\u201d</p><p>Hope looked up. \u201cIt\u2019s not leaking, that\u2019s a good sign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite good enough, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat damned Cheryl Creighton was supposed to be down here to give it a good cleaning, but she had excuses three days in a row. Been drinking again is my guess. I got some bedding in the truck and I\u2019ll take you to get dinner. It\u2019ll look better in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there some place else I can stay tonight? A bed-and-breakfast? A motel on the highway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBed-and-breakfast?\u201d she asked with a laugh. \u201cThis look like a tourist spot to you?</p><p>The highway\u2019s an hour off and this is no ordinary rain. I have a big house with no room in it\u2014filled to the top with junk. They\u2019re gonna light a match to it when I die. It would take all night to clear off the couch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must be something...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNearest thing is Jo Ellen\u2019s place\u2014she\u2019s got a nice spare room over the garage she lets out sometimes. But you wouldn\u2019t want to stay there. That husband of hers can be a handful. He\u2019s been slapped down by more than one woman in Virgin River\u2014and it\u2019d be a bad thing, you in your nightie, Jo Ellen sound asleep and him getting ideas. He\u2019s a groper, that one.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, Mel thought. Every second this place sounded worse and worse.</p><p>\u201cTell you what we\u2019ll do, girl. I\u2019ll light the hot water heater, turn on the refrigerator and heater, then we\u2019ll go get a hot meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the Pie and Coffee shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat place closed down three years back,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut you sent me a picture of it\u2014like it was where I\u2019d be getting lunch or dinner for the next year!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDetails. Lord, you do get yourself worked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorked up!?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo jump in the truck and I\u2019ll be right along,\u201d she commanded. Then ignoring Mel completely, she went to the refrigerator and stooped to plug it in. The light went on immediately and Mrs. McCrea reached inside to adjust the temperature and close the door. The refrigerator\u2019s motor made an unhealthy grinding sound as it fired up. Mel went to the Suburban as she\u2019d been told, but it was so high off the ground she found herself grabbing the inside of the open door and nearly crawling inside. She felt a lot safer here than in the house where her hostess would be lighting a gas water heater. She had a passing thought that if it blew up and destroyed the cabin, they could cut their loses here and now.</p><p>Once in the passenger seat, she looked over her shoulder to see the back of the Suburban was full of pillows, blankets and boxes. Supplies for the falling-down house, she assumed. Well, if she couldn\u2019t get out of here tonight, she could sleep in her car if she had to. She wouldn\u2019t freeze to death with all those blankets. But then, at first light...</p><p>A few minutes passed and then Mrs. McCrea came out of the cottage and pulled the door closed. No locking up. Mel was impressed by the agility with which the old woman got herself into the Suburban. She put a foot on the step, grabbed the handle above the door with one hand, the armrest with the other and bounced herself right into the seat. She had a rather large pillow to sit on and her seat was pushed way up so she could reach the pedals. Without a word, she put the vehicle in gear and expertly backed down the narrow drive out onto the road.</p><p>\u201cWhen we talked a couple weeks ago, you said you were pretty tough,\u201d Mrs. McCrea reminded her.</p><p>\u201cI am. I\u2019ve been in charge of a women\u2019s wing at a three-thousand-bed county hospital for the past two years. We got all the most challenging cases and hopeless patients, and did a damn fine job if I do say so myself. Before that, I spent years in the emergency room in downtown L.A., a very tough place by anyone\u2019s standards. By tough, I thought you meant medically. I didn\u2019t know you meant I should be an experienced frontier woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord, you do go on. You\u2019ll feel better after some food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Mel replied. But, inside she was saying, I can\u2019t stay here. This was crazy, I\u2019m admitting it and getting the hell out of here. The only thing she really dreaded was owning up to Joey.</p><p>They didn\u2019t talk during the drive. In Mel\u2019s mind there wasn\u2019t much to say. Plus, she was fascinated by the ease, speed and finesse with which Ms. McCrea handled the big Suburban, bouncing down the tree-lined road and around the tight curves in the pouring rain.</p><p>She had thought this might be a respite from pain and loneliness and fear. A relief from the stress of patients who were either the perpetrators or victims of crimes, or devastatingly poor and without resources or hope. When she saw the pictures of the cute little town, it was easy to imagine a homey place where people needed her. She saw herself blooming under the grateful thanks of rosy-cheeked country patients. Meaningful work was the one thing that had always cut through any troubling personal issues. Not to mention the lift of escaping the smog and traffic and getting back to nature in the pristine beauty of the forest. She just never thought she\u2019d be getting this far back to nature.</p><p>The prospect of delivering babies for mostly uninsured women in rural Virgin River had closed the deal. Working as a nurse practitioner was satisfying, but midwifery was her true calling.</p><p>Joey was her only family now; she wanted Mel to come to Colorado Springs and stay with her, her husband Bill and their three children. But Mel hadn\u2019t wanted to trade one city for another, even though Colorado Springs was considerably smaller. Now, in the absence of any better ideas, she would be forced to look for work there. As they passed through what seemed to be a town, she grimaced again. \u201cIs this the town? Because this wasn\u2019t in the pictures you sent me, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVirgin River,\u201d she said. \u201cSuch as it is. Looks a lot better in daylight, that\u2019s for sure. Damn, this is a big rain. March always brings us this nasty weather. That\u2019s the doc\u2019s house there, where he sees patients when they come to him. He makes a lot of house calls, too. The library,\u201d she pointed. \u201cOpen Tuesdays.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>They passed a pleasant-looking steepled church, which appeared to be boarded up, but at least she recognized it. There was the store, much older and more worn, the proprietor just locking the front door for the night. A dozen houses lined the street\u2014</p><p>small and old. \u201cWhere\u2019s the schoolhouse?\u201d Mel asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhat schoolhouse?\u201d Mrs. McCrea countered.</p><p>\u201cThe one in the picture you sent to the recruiter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. Can\u2019t imagine where I got that. We don\u2019t have a school. Yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Mel groaned.</p><p>The street was wide, but dark and vacant\u2014there were no streetlights. The old woman must have gone through one of her ancient photo albums to come up with the pictures. Or maybe she snapped a few of another town.</p> <p>Across the street from the doctor\u2019s house Mrs. McCrea pulled up to the front of what looked like a large cabin with a wide porch and big yard, but the neon sign in the window that said Open clued her in to the fact that it was a tavern or caf\u00e9. \u201cCome on,\u201d</p><p>Mrs. McCrea said. \u201cLet\u2019s warm up your belly and your mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Mel said, trying to be polite. She was starving and didn\u2019t want an attitude to cost her her dinner, though she wasn\u2019t optimistic that anything but her stomach would be warm. She looked at her watch. Seven o\u2019clock. Mrs. McCrea shook out her slicker on the porch before going in, but Mel wasn\u2019t wearing a raincoat. Nor did she have an umbrella. Her jacket was now drenched and she smelled like wet sheep.</p><p>Once inside, she was rather pleasantly surprised. It was dark and woody with a fire ablaze in a big stone hearth. The polished wood floors were shiny clean and something smelled good, edible. Over a long bar, above rows of shelved liquor bottles, was a huge mounted fish; on another wall, a bearskin so big it covered half the wall. Over the door, a stag\u2019s head. Whew. A hunting lodge? There were about a dozen tables sans tablecloths and only one customer at the bar; the old man who had pulled her out of the mud sat slumped over a drink.</p><p>Behind the bar stood a tall man in a plaid shirt with sleeves rolled up, polishing a glass with a towel. He looked to be in his late thirties and wore his brown hair cropped close. He lifted expressive brows and his chin in greeting as they entered. Then his lips curved in a smile.</p><p>\u201cSit here,\u201d Hope McCrea said, indicating a table near the fire. \u201cI\u2019ll get you something.\u201d</p> <p>Mel took off her coat and hung it over the chair back near the fire to dry. She warmed herself, vigorously rubbing her icy hands together in front of the flames. This was more what she had expected\u2014a cozy, clean cabin, a blazing fire, a meal ready on the stove. She could do without the dead animals, but this is what you get in hunting country.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d the old woman said, pressing a small glass of amber liquid into her hand.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019ll warm you up. Jack\u2019s got some stew on the stove and bread in the warmer. We\u2019ll fix you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBrandy. You gonna be able to get that down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right,\u201d she said, taking a grateful sip and feeling it burn its way down to her empty belly. She let her eyes drift closed for a moment, appreciating the unexpected finequality. She looked back at the bar, but the bartender had disappeared. \u201cThat guy,\u201d</p><p>she finally said, indicating the only customer. \u201cHe pulled me out of the ditch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc Mullins,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou might as well meet him right now, if you\u2019re okay to leave the fire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy bother?\u201d Mel said. \u201cI told you\u2014I\u2019m not staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d the old woman said tiredly. \u201cThen you can say hello and goodbye all at once. Come on.\u201d She turned and walked toward the old doctor and with a weary sigh, Mel followed. \u201cDoc, this is Melinda Monroe, in case you didn\u2019t catch the name before. Miss Monroe, meet Doc Mullins.\u201d</p><p>He looked up from his drink with rheumy eyes and regarded her, but his arthritic hands never left his glass. He gave another single nod.</p><p>\u201cThanks again,\u201d Mel said. \u201cFor pulling me out.\u201d</p><p>The old doctor gave a nod, looking back to his drink.</p><p>So much for the friendly small-town atmosphere, she thought. Mrs. McCrea was walking back to the fireplace. She plunked herself down at the table.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Mel said to the doctor. He turned his gaze toward her, but his bushy white brows were drawn together in a definite scowl, peering over the top of his glasses. His white hair was so thin over his freckled scalp that it almost appeared he had more hair on his brows than his head. \u201cPleasure to meet you. So, you wanted help up here?\u201d He just seemed to glare at her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t want help? Which is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t much need any help,\u201d he told her gruffly. \u201cBut that old woman\u2019s been trying to get a doc to replace me for years. She\u2019s driven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d Mel bravely asked.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t imagine.\u201d He looked back into his glass. \u201cMaybe she just doesn\u2019t like me. Since I don\u2019t like her that much, makes no difference.\u201d</p><p>The bartender, and presumably proprietor, was carrying a steaming bowl out of the back, but he paused at the end of the bar and watched as Mel conversed with the old doctor.</p><p>\u201cWell, no worries, mate,\u201d Mel responded, \u201cI\u2019m not staying. It was grossly misrepresented. I\u2019ll be leaving in the morning, as soon as the rain lets up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasted your time, did you?\u201d he asked, not looking at her.</p><p>\u201cApparently. It\u2019s bad enough the place isn\u2019t what I was told it would be, but how about the complication that you have no use for a practitioner or midwife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mel sighed. She hoped she could find a decent job in Colorado. A young man, a teenager, brought a rack of glasses from the kitchen into the bar. He sported much the same look as the bartender with his short cropped, thick brown hair, flannel shirt and jeans. Handsome kid, she thought, taking in his strong jaw, straight nose, heavy brows. As he was about to put the rack under the bar, he stopped short, staring at Mel in surprise. His eyes grew wide; his mouth dropped open for a second. She tilted her head slightly and treated him to a smile. He closed his mouth slowly, but stood frozen, holding the glasses.</p><p>Mel turned away from the boy and the doctor. She headed for Mrs. McCrea\u2019s table. The bartender set down a bowl along with a napkin and utensils, then stood there awaiting her. He held the chair for her. Close up, she saw how big a guy he was\u2014over six feet and broad-shouldered. \u201cMiserable weather for your first night in Virgin River,\u201d he said pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cMiss Melinda Monroe, this is Jack Sheridan. Jack, Miss Monroe.\u201d</p><p>Mel felt the urge to correct them\u2014tell them it was Mrs. But she didn\u2019t because she didn\u2019t want to explain that there was no longer a Mr. Monroe, a Dr. Monroe in fact. So she said, \u201cPleased to meet you. Thank you,\u201d she added, accepting the stew.</p><p>\u201cThis is a beautiful place, when the weather cooperates,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it is,\u201d she muttered, not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cYou should give it a day or two,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>She dipped her spoon into the stew and gave it a taste. He hovered near the table for a moment. Then she looked up at him and said in some surprise, \u201cThis is delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSquirrel,\u201d he said.</p><p>She choked.</p><p>\u201cJust kidding,\u201d he said, grinning at her. \u201cBeef. Corn fed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgive me if my sense of humor is a bit off,\u201d she replied irritably. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long and rather arduous day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas it now?\u201d he said. \u201cGood thing I got the cork out of the Remy, then.\u201d He went back behind the bar and she looked over her shoulder at him. He seemed to confer briefly and quietly with the young man, who continued to stare at her. His son, Mel decided.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that you have to be quite so pissy,\u201d Mrs. McCrea said. \u201cI didn\u2019t sense any of this attitude when we talked on the phone.\u201d She dug into her purse and pulled out a pack of cigarettes. She shook one out and lit it\u2014this explained the gravelly voice.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to smoke?\u201d Mel asked her.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, I do,\u201d Mrs. McCrea said, taking a long drag. Mel just shook her head in frustration. She held her tongue. It was settled, she was leaving in the morning and would have to sleep in the car, so why exacerbate things by continuing to complain? Hope McCrea had certainly gotten the message by now. Mel ate the delicious stew, sipped the brandy, and felt a bit more secure once her belly was full and her head a tad light. There, she thought. That is better. I can make it through the night in this dump. God knows, I\u2019ve been through worse. It had been nine months since her husband, Mark, had stopped off at a convenience store after working a long night shift in the emergency room. He had wanted milk for his cereal. But what he got was three bullets, point-blank to the chest, killing him instantly. There had been a robbery in progress, right in a store he and Mel dropped into at least three times a week. It had ended the life she loved. Spending the night in her car, in the rain, would be nothing by comparison. Jack delivered a second Remy Martin to Miss Monroe, but she had declined a second serving of stew. He stayed behind the bar while she ate, drank and seemed to glower at Hope as she smoked. It caused him to chuckle to himself. The girl had a little spirit. What she also had was looks. Petite, blond, flashing blue eyes, a small heart-shaped mouth, and a backside in a pair of jeans that was just awesome. When the women left, he said to Doc Mullins, \u201cThanks a lot. You could have cut the girl some slack. We haven\u2019t had anything pretty to look at around here since Bradley\u2019s old golden retriever died last fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d the doctor said.</p><p>Ricky came behind the bar and stood next to Jack. \u201cYeah,\u201d he heartily agreed. \u201cHoly God, Doc. What\u2019s the matter with you? Can\u2019t you think of the rest of us sometimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown boy,\u201d Jack laughed, draping an arm over his shoulders. \u201cShe\u2019s outta your league.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? She\u2019s outta yours, too,\u201d Rick said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cYou can shove off anytime. There isn\u2019t going to be anyone out tonight,\u201d Jack told Rick. \u201cTake a little of that stew home to your grandma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, thanks,\u201d he said. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>When Rick had gone, Jack hovered over Doc and said, \u201cIf you had a little help, you could do more fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t need help, thanks,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s that again,\u201d Jack said with a smile. Any suggestion Hope had made of getting Doc some help was stubbornly rebuffed. Doc might be the most obstinate and pigheaded man in town. He was also old, arthritic and seemed to be slowing down more each year.</p><p>\u201cHit me again,\u201d the doctor said.</p><p>\u201cI thought we had a deal,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cHalf, then. This goddamn rain is killing me. My bones are cold.\u201d He looked up at Jack. \u201cI did pull that little strumpet out of the ditch in the freezing rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably not a strumpet,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI could never be that lucky.\u201d Jack tipped the bottle of bourbon over the old man\u2019s glass and gave him a shot. But then he put the bottle on the shelf. It was his habit to look out for Doc and left unchecked, he might have a bit too much. He didn\u2019t feel like going out in the rain to be sure Doc got across the street all right. Doc didn\u2019t keep a supply at home, doing his drinking only at Jack\u2019s, which kept it under control.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t blame the old boy\u2014he was overworked and lonely. Not to mention prickly.</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve offered the girl a warm place to sleep,\u201d Jack said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear Hope didn\u2019t get that old cabin straight for her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t feel up to company,\u201d he said. Then Doc lifted his gaze to Jack\u2019s face. \u201cSeems you\u2019re more interested than me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t really look like she\u2019d trust anyone around here at the moment,\u201d Jack said.</p> <p>\u201cCute little thing, though, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I noticed,\u201d he said. He took a sip and then said, \u201cDidn\u2019t look like she had the muscle for the job, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed, \u201cThought you didn\u2019t notice?\u201d But he had noticed. She was maybe fivethree. Hundred and ten pounds. Soft, curling blond hair that, when damp, curled even more. Eyes that could go from kind of sad to feisty in an instant. He enjoyed that little spark when she had snapped at him that she didn\u2019t feel particularly humorous. And when she took on Doc, there was a light that suggested she could handle all kinds of things just fine. But the best part was that mouth\u2014that little pink heart-shaped mouth. Or maybe it was the fanny.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou could\u2019ve cut a guy a break and been a little friendlier. Improve the scenery around here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p> <p>W hen Mel and Mrs. McCrea returned to the cabin, it had warmed up inside. Of course, it hadn\u2019t gotten any cleaner. Mel shuddered at the filth and Mrs. McCrea said,</p><p>\u201cI had no idea, when I talked to you, that you were so prissy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not. A labor and delivery unit in a big hospital like the one I came from is pretty unglamorous.\u201d And it struck Mel as curious that she had felt more in control in that chaotic, sometimes horrific environment than in this far simpler one. She decided it was the apparent deception that was throwing her for a loop. That and the fact that however gritty things got in L&amp;D, she always had a comfortable and clean house to go home to.</p><p>Hope left her in possession of pillows, blankets, quilts and towels, and Mel decided it made more sense to brave the dirt than the cold. Retrieving only one suitcase from her car, she put on a sweatsuit, heavy socks, and made herself a bed on the dusty old couch. The mattress, stained and sagging, looked too frightening. She rolled herself up in the quilts like a burrito and huddled down into the soft, musty cushions. The bathroom light was left on with the door pulled slightly closed, in case she had to get up in the night. And thanks to two brandies, the long drive and the stress of spoiled expectations, she fell into a deep sleep, for once not disturbed by anxiety or nightmares. The softly drumming rain on the roof was like a lullaby, rocking her to sleep. With the dim light of morning on her face, she woke to find she hadn\u2019t moved a muscle all night, but lay swaddled and still. Rested. Her head empty. It was a rare thing.</p><p>Disbelieving, she lay there for a while. Yes, she thought. Though it doesn\u2019t seem possible under the circumstances, I feel good. Then Mark\u2019s face swam before her eyes and she thought, what do you expect? You summoned it!</p><p>She further thought, there\u2019s nowhere you can go to escape grief. Why try?</p> <p>There was a time she had been so content, especially waking up in the morning. She had this weird and funny gift\u2014music in her head. Every morning, the first thing she noticed was a song, clear as if the radio was on. Always a different one. Although in the bright light of day Mel couldn\u2019t play an instrument or carry a tune in a bucket, she awoke each morning humming along with a melody. Awakened by her off-key humming, Mark would raise up on an elbow, lean over her, grinning, and wait for her eyes to pop open. He would say, \u201cWhat is it today?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Begin the Beguine,\u2019\u201d she\u2019d answer. Or, \u201c\u2018Deep Purple.\u2019\u201d And he\u2019d laugh and laugh. The music in her head went away with his death.</p><p>She sat up, quilts wrapped around her, and the morning light emphasized the dirty cabin that surrounded her. The sound of chirping birds brought her to her feet and to the cabin\u2019s front door. She opened it and greeted a morning that was bright and clear. She stepped out onto the porch, still wrapped in her quilts, and looked up\u2014the pines, firs and ponderosa were so tall in daylight\u2014rising fifty to sixty feet above the cabin, some considerably taller. They were still dripping from a rain that had washed them clean. Green pinecones were hanging from branches\u2014pinecones so large that if a green one fell on your head, it might cause a concussion. Beneath them, thick, lush green fern\u2014she counted four different types from wide-branched floppy fans to those as delicate as lace. Everything looked fresh and healthy. Birds sang and danced from limb to limb, and she looked into a sky that was an azure blue the likes of which she hadn\u2019t seen in Los Angeles in ten years. A puffy white cloud floated aimlessly above and an eagle, wings spread wide, soared overhead and disappeared behind the trees. She inhaled a deep breath of the crisp spring morning. Ah, she thought. Too bad the cabin, town and old doctor didn\u2019t work out, because the land was lovely. Unspoiled. Invigorating.</p><p>She heard a crack and furrowed her brow. Without warning the end of the porch that had been sagging gave out completely, collapsing at the weak end which created a big slide, knocking her off her feet and splat! Right into a deep, wet, muddy hole. There she lay, a filthy, wet, ice cold burrito in her quilt. \u201cCrap,\u201d she said, rolling out of the quilt to crawl back up the porch, still attached at the starboard end. And into the house.</p><p>She packed up her suitcase. It was over.</p><p>At least the roads were now passable, and in the light of day she was safe from hitting a soft shoulder and sinking out of sight. Reasoning she wouldn\u2019t get far without at least coffee, she headed back toward the town, even though her instincts told her to run for her life, get coffee somewhere down the road. She didn\u2019t expect that bar to be open early in the morning, but her options seemed few. She might be desperate enough to bang on the old doctor\u2019s door and beg a cup of coffee from him, though facing his grimace again wasn\u2019t an inviting thought. But the doc\u2019s house looked closed up tighter than a tick. There didn\u2019t seem to be any action around Jack\u2019s or the store across the street, but a complete caffeine junkie, she tried the door at the bar and it swung open.</p><p>The fire was lit. The room, though brighter than the night before, was just as welcoming. It was large and comfortable\u2014even with the animal trophies on the walls. Then she was startled to see a huge bald man with an earring glittering in one ear come from the back to stand behind the bar. He wore a black T-shirt stretched tight over his massive chest, the bottom of a big blue tattoo peeking out beneath one of the snug sleeves. If she hadn\u2019t gasped from the sheer size of him, she might\u2019ve from the unpleasant expression on his face. His dark bushy brows were drawn together and he braced two hands on the bar. \u201cHelp you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUm...Coffee?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>He turned around to grab a mug. He put it on the bar and poured from a handy pot. She thought about grabbing it and fleeing to a table, but she frankly didn\u2019t like the look of him, didn\u2019t want to insult him, so she went to the bar and sat up on the stool where her coffee waited. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said meekly.</p><p>He just gave a nod and backed away from the bar a bit, leaning against the counter behind him with his huge arms crossed over his chest. He reminded her of a nightclub bouncer or bodyguard. Jesse Ventura with attitude.</p><p>She took a sip of the rich, hot brew. Her appreciation for a dynamite cup of coffee surpassed any other comfort in her life and she said, \u201cAh. Delicious.\u201d No comment from the big man. Just as well, she thought. She didn\u2019t feel like talking anyway. A few minutes passed in what seemed like oddly companionable silence when the side door to the bar opened and in came Jack, his arms laden with firewood. When he saw her, he grinned, showing a nice batch of even, white teeth. Under the weight of the wood his biceps strained against his blue denim shirt, the width of his shoulders accentuated a narrow waist. A little light brown chest hair peeked out of the opened collar and his clean-shaven face made her realize that the night before his cheeks and chin had been slightly shadowed by the day\u2019s growth of beard.</p><p>\u201cWell, now,\u201d he said. \u201cGood morning.\u201d He took the firewood to the hearth and when he stooped to stack it there, she couldn\u2019t help but notice a broad, muscular back and a perfect male butt. Men around here must get a pretty good workout just getting through the rugged days of rural living.</p><p>The big bald man lifted the pot to refill her cup when Jack said, \u201cI got that, Preacher.\u201d</p><p>Jack came behind the bar and \u201cPreacher\u201d went through the door to the kitchen. Jack filled her cup.</p><p>\u201cPreacher?\u201d she asked in a near whisper.</p><p>\u201cHis name is actually John Middleton, but he got that nickname way back. If you called out to John, he wouldn\u2019t even turn around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you call him that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAh, he\u2019s pretty straight-laced. Hardly ever swears, never see him drunk, doesn\u2019t bother women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a little frightening looking,\u201d she said, still keeping her voice low.</p><p>\u201cNah. He\u2019s a pussycat,\u201d Jack said. \u201cHow was your night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPassable,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could make it out of town without a cup of coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be ready to kill Hope. She didn\u2019t even have coffee for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Fraid not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about this, Miss Monroe. You should\u2019ve had a better welcome than this. I don\u2019t blame you for thinking the worst of this place. How about some eggs?\u201d He gestured over his shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say no,\u201d she said. She felt that odd sensation of a smile on her lips. \u201cAnd call me Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShort for Melinda,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jack hollered through the door to the kitchen. \u201cPreacher. How about some breakfast for the lady?\u201d Back at the bar, he said, \u201cWell, the least we can do is send you off with a good meal\u2014if you can\u2019t be convinced to stay a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cThat cabin. It\u2019s uninhabitable. Mrs. McCrea said something about someone who was supposed to clean it\u2014but she\u2019s drinking? I think I got that right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be Cheryl. Has a bit of a problem that way, I\u2019m afraid. She should\u2019ve called someone else. Plenty of women around here who\u2019d take a little work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s irrelevant now,\u201d Mel said, sipping again. \u201cJack, this is the best coffee I\u2019ve ever had. Either that, or I had a bad couple of days and am easily impressed by some creature comforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s really that good.\u201d He frowned and reached out, lifting a lock of her hair off her shoulder. \u201cDo you have mud in your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d she said. \u201cI was standing on the porch, appreciating the beauty of this nice spring morning when one end gave way and spilled me right into a big, nasty mud puddle. And I wasn\u2019t brave enough to try out the shower\u2014it\u2019s beyond filthy. But I thought I got it all off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man,\u201d he said, surprising her with a big laugh. \u201cCould you have had a worse day? If you\u2019d like, I have a shower in my quarters\u2014clean as a whistle.\u201d He grinned again. \u201cTowels even smell like Downy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I think I\u2019ll just move on. When I get closer to the coast, I\u2019m going to get a hotel room and have a quiet, warm, clean evening. Maybe rent a movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds nice,\u201d he said. \u201cThen back to Los Angeles?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. She couldn\u2019t do that. Everything from the hospital to the house would conjure sweet memories and bring her grief to the surface. She just couldn\u2019t move on as long as she stayed in L.A. Besides, now there was nothing there for her anymore. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change. But it turns out this was too big a change. Have you lived here all your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? No. Only a little while. I grew up in Sacramento. I was looking for a good place to fish and stayed on. I converted this cabin into a bar and grill and built on an addition to live in. Small, but comfortable. Preacher has a room upstairs, over the kitchen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world made you stay on? I\u2019m not trying to be flip\u2014there doesn\u2019t seem to be that much of a town here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had the time, I\u2019d show you. This is incredible country. Over six hundred people live in and around town. Lots of people from the cities have cabins up and down the Virgin River\u2014it\u2019s peaceful and the fishing is excellent. We don\u2019t have much tourist traffic through town, but fishermen come in here pretty regularly and some hunters pass through during the season. Preacher is known for his cooking, and it\u2019s the only place in town to get a beer. We\u2019re right up against some redwoods\u2014</p> <p>awesome. Majestic. Lots of campers and hikers around the national forests all through the summer. And the sky and air out here\u2014you just can\u2019t find anything like it in a city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your son works here with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon? Oh,\u201d he laughed. \u201cRicky? He\u2019s a kid from town. He works around the bar after school most days. Good kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have family?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSisters and nieces in Sacramento. My dad is still there, but I lost my mother a few years back.\u201d</p> <p>Preacher came out of the kitchen holding a steaming plate with a napkin. As he sat it before Mel, Jack reached beneath the bar and produced silverware and a napkin. On the plate was a luscious-looking cheese omelet with peppers, sausage patties, fruit, home fries, wheat toast. Ice water appeared; her coffee was refilled. Mel dipped into the omelet and brought it to her mouth. It melted there, rich and delicious. \u201cMmmm,\u201d she said, letting her eyes close. After she swallowed she said,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve eaten here twice, and I have to say the food is some of the best I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe and Preacher\u2014we can whip up some good food, sometimes. Preacher has a real gift. And he wasn\u2019t a cook until he got up here.\u201d</p><p>She took another bite. Apparently Jack was going to stand there through her meal and watch her devour every bite. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat\u2019s the story on the doctor and Mrs. McCrea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s see,\u201d he said, leaning his back on the counter behind the bar, his arms wide, big hands braced on either side of him. \u201cThey tend to bicker. Two opinionated, stubborn old farts who can\u2019t agree on anything. The fact of the matter is, I think Doc could use help\u2014but I imagine you gathered he\u2019s a bit on the obstinate side.\u201d</p><p>She made an affirmative noise, her mouth full of the most wonderful eggs she\u2019d ever eaten.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing about this little town is\u2014sometimes days go by without anyone needing medical attention. Then there will be weeks when everyone needs to see Doc\u2014a flu going around while three women are about to give birth, and right then someone will fall off a horse or roof. So it goes. And although he doesn\u2019t like to admit it, he is seventy.\u201d Jack gave a shrug. \u201cNext town doctor is at least a half hour away and for rural people out on farms and ranches, over an hour. The hospital is farther yet. Then, we have to think about what will happen when Doc dies, which hopefully won\u2019t be too soon.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed and took a drink of water. \u201cWhy has Mrs. McCrea taken on this project?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs she really trying to replace him, as he says?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. But because of his age, it\u2019s about time for some kind of prot\u00e9g\u00e9, I would think. Hope\u2019s husband left her enough so she\u2019ll be comfortable\u2014she\u2019s been widowed a long time now, I gather. And she seems to do whatever she can to keep the town together. She\u2019s also looking for a preacher, a town cop and a schoolteacher, grades one through eight, so the little ones don\u2019t have to bus two towns over. She hasn\u2019t had much success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor Mullins doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate her efforts,\u201d Mel said, blotting her lips with the napkin.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s territorial. He\u2019s in no way ready for retirement. Maybe he\u2019s worried that someone will show up and take over, leaving him with nothing to do. Man like Doc, never married and in service to a town all his life, would balk at that. But...see...There was an incident a few years ago, just before I got here. Two emergencies at the same time. A truck went off the road and the driver was critically injured, and a kid with a bad case of flu that turned to pneumonia stopped breathing. Doc stopped the bleeding on the truck driver, but by the time he got across the river to the kid, he was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she said. \u201cBet that leaves some hard feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really blames him. He\u2019s saved some lives in his time here. But the feeling he could use some help gets more support.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re the first one to show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, taking a last sip of coffee. She heard the door open behind her and a couple of men walked in.</p> <p>\u201cHarv. Ron,\u201d Jack said. The men said hello and sat at a table by the window. Jack looked back at Mel. \u201cWhat made you come up here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBurnout,\u201d she said. \u201cI got sick of being on a first-name basis with cops and homicide detectives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, just what kind of work did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver been to war?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact,\u201d he replied with a nod.</p><p>\u201cWell, big-city hospitals and trauma centers get like that. I spent years in the emergency room in downtown L.A. while I was doing my post-grad work to become a family nurse practitioner, and there were days it felt like a battle zone. Felons transported to E.R. after incurring injuries during arrest\u2014people who were still so out of control and impossible to subdue that three or four cops had to hold them down while one of the nurses tried to start an IV. Addicts with so much junk in them, three hits with an officer\u2019s Taser wouldn\u2019t even slow \u2019em down, much less a dose of Narcan. O.D.s, victims of violent crimes and, given it was the biggest trauma center in L.A., some of the ugliest MVAs and GSWs...Sorry. Motor vehicle accidents and gunshot wounds. And crazy people with no supervision, nowhere to go, off their meds and...Don\u2019t get me wrong, we did some good work. Excellent work. I\u2019m real proud of what we got done. Best staff in, maybe, America.\u201d</p><p>She gazed off for a second, thinking. The environment was wild and chaotic, yet while she was working with and falling in love with her husband, it was exciting and fulfilling. She gave her head a little shake and went on.</p><p>\u201cI transferred out of E.R. to women\u2019s health, which I found was what I\u2019d been looking for. Labor and delivery. I went to work on my certification in midwifery. That turned out to be my true calling, but it wasn\u2019t always a sweeter experience.\u201d She laughed sadly and shook her head. \u201cMy first patient was brought in by the police and I had to fight them like a bulldog to get the cuffs off. They wanted me to deliver her while she was handcuffed to the bed.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWell, you\u2019re in luck. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a pair of handcuffs in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that every day, but it was like that often. I supervised the nurses on the L&amp;D ward for a couple of years. The excitement and unpredictability zooped me up for a long time, but I finally hit a wall. I love women\u2019s health, but I can\u2019t do city medicine like that anymore. God, I need a slower pace. I\u2019m wiped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an awful lot of adrenaline to leave behind,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been accused of being an adrenaline junky. Emergency nurses often are.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cI\u2019m trying to quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver live in a small town?\u201d he asked, refilling her coffee. She shook her head. \u201cSmallest town I\u2019ve ever lived in had at least a million people in it. I grew up in Seattle and went to Southern California for college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmall towns can be nice. And they can have their own brand of drama. And danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d she asked, sipping.</p><p>\u201cFlood. Fire. Wildlife. Hunters who don\u2019t follow the rules. The occasional criminal. Lotta pot growers out here, but not in Virgin River that I know of. Humboldt Homegrown, it\u2019s called around here. They\u2019re a tight-knit group and usually keep to themselves\u2014don\u2019t want to draw attention. Once in a while, though, there\u2019ll be crime associated with drugs.\u201d He grinned. \u201cBut you never had any of that in the city, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was looking for change, I shouldn\u2019t have made such a drastic one. This is kind of like going cold turkey. I might have to downsize a little more gradually. Maybe try out a town with a couple hundred thousand people and a Starbucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to tell me Starbucks can beat that coffee you\u2019re drinking,\u201d he said, nodding at her cup.</p><p>She gave a short laugh. \u201cCoffee\u2019s great.\u201d She favored him with a pleasant smile, deciding that this guy was okay. \u201cI should\u2019ve considered the roads. To think I left the terror of Los Angeles freeways for the heart-stopping curves and cliffs in these hills...Whew.\u201d A tremor ran through her. \u201cIf I did stay in a place like this, it would be for your food.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her, bracing hands on the bar. Rich brown eyes glowed warm under serious hooded brows. \u201cI can get that cabin put right for you in no time,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard that before.\u201d She put out a hand and he took it. She felt his calluses as he gently squeezed her hand; he was a man who did hard, physical work. \u201cThanks, Jack. Your bar was the only part of this experiment I enjoyed.\u201d She stood and began fishing for her wallet in her purse. \u201cWhat do I owe you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the house. The least I could do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jack\u2014none of this was your doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll send Hope a bill.\u201d</p><p>At that moment Preacher came out of the kitchen with a covered dish wrapped in a towel. He handed it to Jack.</p><p>\u201cDoc\u2019s breakfast. I\u2019ll walk out with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said.</p><p>At her car, he said, \u201cNo kidding. I wish you\u2019d think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Jack. This isn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, damn. There\u2019s a real dearth of beautiful young women around here. Have a safe drive.\u201d He gave her elbow a little squeeze, balancing the covered dish in his other hand. And all she could think was, what a peach of a guy. Lots of sex appeal in his dark eyes, strong jaw, small cleft in his chin and the gracious, laid-back manner that suggested he didn\u2019t know he was good-looking. Someone should snap him up before he figured it out. Probably someone had.</p><p>Mel watched him walk across the street to the doctor\u2019s house, then got into her car. She made a wide U-turn on the deserted street and headed back the way she had come. As she drove by Doc\u2019s house, she slowed. Jack was crouched on the porch, looking at something. The covered dish was still balanced on one hand and he lifted the other, signaling her to stop. As he looked toward her car, his expression was one of shock. Disbelief.</p><p>Mel stopped the car and got out. \u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He stood up. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you come here a sec?\u201d</p><p>She left the car running, the door open, and went up on the porch. It was a box, sitting there in front of the doctor\u2019s door, and the look on Jack\u2019s face remained stunned. She crouched down and looked within and there, swaddled and squirming around, was a baby. \u201cJesus,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s Jesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis baby was not here when I passed his house earlier.\u201d</p><p>Mel lifted the box and asked Jack to park and turn off her car. She rang the doctor\u2019s bell and after a few tense moments, he opened it wearing a plaid flannel bathrobe, loosely tied over his big belly and barely covering a nightshirt, his skinny legs sticking out of the bottom.</p><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s you. Never know when to quit, do you? You bring my breakfast?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cMore than breakfast,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was left on your doorstep. Have any idea who would do that?\u201d</p><p>He pulled at the receiving blanket and revealed the baby. \u201cIt\u2019s a newborn,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cProbably only hours old. Bring it in. Ain\u2019t yours, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said in aggravation, as though the doctor hadn\u2019t even noticed that she was not only too thin to have been pregnant, but also too lively to have just given birth. \u201cBelieve me, if it were mine, I wouldn\u2019t have left it here.\u201d</p><p>She walked past him into his house. She found herself not in a home, but a clinic\u2014</p><p>waiting room on her right, reception area complete with computer and filing cabinets behind a counter on her left. She went straight back on instinct and when she found an exam room, turned into it. Her only concern at the moment was making sure the infant wasn\u2019t ill or in need of emergency medical assistance. She put the box on the exam table, shed her coat and washed her hands. There was a stethoscope on the counter, so she found cotton and rubbing alcohol. She cleaned the earpieces with the alcohol\u2014her own stethoscope was packed in the car. She listened to the baby\u2019s heart. Further inspection revealed it was a little girl, her umbilicus tied off with string. Gently, tenderly, she lifted the baby from the box and cooing, lay her on the baby scale. By this time the doctor was in the room. \u201cSix pounds, nine ounces,\u201d she reported.</p><p>\u201cFull term. Heartbeat and respirations normal. Color is good.\u201d The baby started to wail. \u201cStrong lungs. Somebody threw away a perfectly good baby. You need to get Social Services right out here.\u201d</p> <p>Doc gave a short laugh just as Jack came up behind him, looking into the room. \u201cYup, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what are you going to do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m going to rustle up some formula,\u201d he said. \u201cSounds hungry.\u201d He turned around and left the exam room.</p><p>\u201cFor the love of God,\u201d Mel said, rewrapping and jiggling the baby in her arms.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on him,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t L.A. We don\u2019t put in a call to Social Services and get an immediate house call. We\u2019re kind of on our own out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the police?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no local police. County sheriff\u2019s department is pretty good,\u201d he said. \u201cNot exactly what you\u2019re looking for, either, I bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s not a serious crime, they would probably take their time,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have an awful lot of ground to cover. The deputy might just come out and write a report and put their own call in to Social Services, which will get a response when they\u2019re not overworked, underpaid, and can rustle up a social worker or foster family to take over this little...\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cProblem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t call her a problem,\u201d she admonished. She started opening cupboard doors, unsatisfied. \u201cWhere\u2019s the kitchen?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cThat way,\u201d he said, pointing left.</p><p>\u201cFind me towels,\u201d she instructed. \u201cPreferably soft towels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to wash her.\u201d She left the exam room with the baby in her arms. Mel found the kitchen, which was large and clean. If Jack was delivering the doctor\u2019s meals, it probably wasn\u2019t used that much. She tossed the dish rack onto the floor in the corner and gently laid the baby on the drain board. Under the sink she found cleanser and gave the sink a quick scrub and rinse. Then she tested the temperature and filled the sink with water while the baby, most annoyed at the moment, filled the kitchen with the noise of her unhappiness. Fortuitously, there was a bar of Ivory soap on the sink, which Mel rinsed off as thoroughly as possible. Rolling up her sleeves, she lifted the naked little creature into her arms and lowered her into the warm water. The cries stopped. \u201cAw,\u201d she said. \u201cYou like the bath? Does it feel like home?\u201d</p> <p>Doc Mullins came into the kitchen, dressed now, with a canister of powdered formula. Behind him trailed Jack, bearing the towels he was asked to fetch. Mel gently rubbed the soap over the baby, rinsing off the muck of birth, the warmth of the water hopefully bringing the baby\u2019s temperature up. \u201cThis umbilicus is going to need some attention,\u201d she said. \u201cAny idea who gave birth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone whatsoever,\u201d Doc said, pouring bottled water into a measuring bowl.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s pregnant? That would be a logical place to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pregnant women in Virgin River who have been coming here for prenatal visits wouldn\u2019t give birth alone. Maybe someone came from another town. Maybe I\u2019ve got a patient out there who gave birth without the benefit of medical assistance, and that could be the second crisis of the day. As I\u2019m sure you know,\u201d he added, somewhat smugly.</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019m sure I do,\u201d she returned, with equal smugness. \u201cSo, what\u2019s your plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine I will diaper and feed and become irritable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you mean more irritable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see many options,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t there any women in town who could help out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps on a limited basis.\u201d He filled a bottle and popped it in the microwave. \u201cI\u2019ll manage, don\u2019t you worry.\u201d Then he added, somewhat absently, \u201cMight not hear her in the night, but she\u2019ll live through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to find a home for this baby,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou came here looking for work. Why don\u2019t you offer to help?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and, lifting the baby from the sink, laid her in the towel being held by Jack. She cocked her head in appreciation as Jack took the infant confidently, wrapping her snugly and cuddling her close. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty good at that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThe nieces,\u201d he said, jiggling the baby against his broad chest. \u201cI\u2019ve held a baby or two. You going to stay on a bit?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, there are problems with that idea. I have nowhere to stay. That cabin is not only unacceptable for me, it\u2019s more unacceptable for this infant. The porch collapsed, remember? And there are no steps to the back door. The only way in is to literally crawl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a room upstairs,\u201d Doc said. \u201cIf you stay and help out, you\u2019ll be paid.\u201d Then he looked at her over the rims of his reading glasses and sternly added, \u201cDon\u2019t get attached to her. Her mother will turn up and want her back.\u201d</p><p>Jack went back to the bar and placed a call from the kitchen. A groggy, thick voice answered. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheryl? You up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThat you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me. I need a favor. Right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you asked to clean that McCrea cabin for the nurse coming to town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh...Yeah. Didn\u2019t get to it though. I had...I think it was the flu.\u201d</p><p>It was the Smirnoff flu, he thought. Or even more likely, the Everclear flu\u2014that really evil 190-proof pure grain alcohol. \u201cCan you do it today? I\u2019m going out there to repair the porch and I need that place cleaned. I mean, really cleaned. She\u2019s here and is staying with Doc for now\u2014but that place has to be whipped into shape. So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the day. I can call someone else. I thought I\u2019d give you a crack at it first, but you have to be sober.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sober,\u201d she insisted. \u201cTotally.\u201d</p><p>He doubted it. He expected she would have a flask with her as she cleaned. But the risk he was taking, and it was not a pleasant risk, was that she would do it for him, and do it very well if it was for him. Cheryl had had a crush on him since he hit town and found excuses to be around him. He tried very hard never to give her any encouragement. But despite her struggle with alcohol, she was a strong woman and good at cleaning when she put her mind to it.</p><p>\u201cThe door\u2019s open. Get started and I\u2019ll be out later.\u201d</p><p>He hung up the phone and Preacher said, \u201cNeed a hand, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s close up and get the cabin fixed up. She might be persuaded to stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what the town needs,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>If Mel practiced any other kind of medicine, she might\u2019ve put the baby in the old doctor\u2019s arthritic hands and gotten in her car to leave. But a midwife would never do that\u2014couldn\u2019t turn her back on an abandoned newborn. For that matter, she couldn\u2019t shake a profound concern for the baby\u2019s mother. It was settled within seconds; she couldn\u2019t leave the baby to an old doctor who might not hear her cry in the night. And she had to be close by if the mother sought medical attention because women in childbirth and postpartum were her specialty.</p><p>During the rest of the day, Mel had ample opportunity to check out the rest of Doc\u2019s house. The spare room he provided turned out to be more than something for overnight guests\u2014it was furnished with two hospital beds, an IV stand, tray table, bedside bureau and oxygen canister. The only chair in the room happened to be a rocking chair, and Mel was sure that was by design, for the use of a new mother and baby. The baby was provided with a Plexiglas incubator from the downstairs exam room.</p><p>The doctor\u2019s house was completely functional as a clinic and hospital. The downstairs living room was a waiting room, the dining room was fronted by a counter for checkin. There was an exam room, treatment room, both small, and the doctor\u2019s office. In the kitchen there was a small table where he no doubt ate his meals when he wasn\u2019t at Jack\u2019s. No ordinary kitchen, this one had an autoclave for sterilizing and a locked medicine chest for narcotic drugs kept on hand. In the refrigerator, a few units of blood and plasma, as well as food. More blood than food.</p><p>The upstairs had two bedrooms only\u2014the one with the hospital beds and Doc Mullins\u2019s. Her accommodations were not the most comfortable, though better than the filthy cabin. But the room was cold and stark; hardwood floors, small rug, rough sheets with a plastic mattress protector that crinkled noisily. She already missed her down comforter, four hundred count sheets, soft Egyptian towels and thick, plush carpet. It had occurred to her that she would be leaving behind creature comforts, but she thought it might be good for her, thought she was ready for a big change. Mel\u2019s friends and sister had tried to talk her out of this, but unfortunately they had failed. She had barely gotten over the traumatic experience of giving away all of Mark\u2019s clothes and personal items. She\u2019d kept his picture, his watch, the cuff links she had given him on his last birthday\u2014platinum\u2014and his wedding ring. When the job in Virgin River came available, she\u2019d sold all the furniture in their house then put it on the market. There was an offer in three days, even at those ridiculous L.A. prices. She\u2019d packed three boxes of little treasures\u2014favorite books, CDs, pictures, bric-abrac. The desktop computer was given away to a friend, but she\u2019d brought the laptop and her digital camera. As far as clothes, she\u2019d filled three suitcases and an overnight and gave the rest away. No more strapless dresses for fancy charity events; no more sexy nighties for those nights that Mark didn\u2019t have to work late. Mel was going to be starting over no matter what. She had nothing to go back to; she hadn\u2019t wanted anything to tie her to L.A. Now that things in Virgin River were not going as planned, Mel decided to stay and help out for a couple of days and then head out to Colorado. Well, she thought, it\u2019ll be good to be near Joey, Bill and the kids. I can start over there as well as anywhere. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>It had been just Mel and Joey for a long time now. Joey was four years her senior and had been married to Bill for fifteen years. Their mother had died when Mel was only four\u2014she could barely remember her. And their father, considerably older than their mother had been, had passed peacefully in his La-Z-boy at the age of seventy, ten years ago.</p><p>Mark\u2019s parents were still alive and well in L.A., but she had never warmed to them. They had always been stuffy and cool toward her. Mark\u2019s death had brought them briefly closer, but it took only a few months for her to realize that they never called her. She checked on them, asked after their grief, but it seemed they\u2019d let her drift out of sight. She was not surprised to note that she didn\u2019t miss them. She hadn\u2019t even told them she was leaving town.</p> <p>She had wonderful friends, true. Girlfriends from nursing school and from the hospital. They called with regularity. Got her out of the house. Let her talk about him and cry about him. But after a while, though she loved them, she began to associate them with Mark\u2019s death. Every time she saw them, the pitying looks in their eyes was enough to bring out her pain. It was as if everything had been rolled up into one big miserable ball. She just wanted to start over so badly. Someplace where no one knew how empty her life had become.</p><p>Late in the day, Mel handed off the baby to Doc while she took a badly needed shower, scrubbing from head to toe. After she had bathed and dried her hair and donned her long flannel nightgown and big furry slippers, she went downstairs to Doc\u2019s office to collect the infant and a bottle. He gave her such a look, seeing her like that. It startled his eyes open. \u201cI\u2019ll feed her, rock her, and put her down,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cUnless you have something else in mind for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d he said, handing the baby over.</p><p>Up in her room, Mel rocked and fed the baby. And of course, the tears began to well in her eyes.</p> <p>The other thing no one in this town knew was that she couldn\u2019t have children. She and Mark had been seeking help for their infertility. Because she was twenty-eight and he thirty-four when they married, and they\u2019d already been together for two years, they didn\u2019t want to wait. She had never used birth control and after one year of no results they went to see the specialists.</p><p>Nothing appeared to be wrong with Mark, but she\u2019d had to have her tubes blown out and her endometriosis scraped off the outside of her uterus. But still, nothing. She\u2019d taken hormones and stood on her head after intercourse. She took her temperature every day to see when she was ovulating. She went through so many home pregnancy tests, she should have bought stock in the company. Nothing. They had just completed their first fifteen-thousand-dollar attempt at in vitro fertilization when Mark was killed. Somewhere in a freezer in L.A. were more fertilized ovum\u2014if she ever became desperate enough to try to go it alone.</p><p>Alone. That was the operative word. She had wanted a baby so badly. And now she held in her arms an abandoned little girl. A beautiful baby girl with pink skin and a sheer cap of brown hair. It made her literally weep with longing. The baby was healthy and strong, eating with gusto, belching with strength. She slept soundly despite the crying that went on in the bed right beside her. That night Doc Mullins sat up in bed, book in his lap, listening. So\u2014she was in pain. Desperate pain. And she covered it with that flip wit and sarcasm. Nothing is ever what it seems, he thought, flicking off his light.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>M el woke to the ringing of the phone. She checked the baby; she had only awoken twice in the night and still slept soundly. She found her slippers and went downstairs to see if she could rustle up some coffee. Doc Mullins was already in the kitchen, dressed.</p><p>\u201cGoing out to the Driscolls\u2019\u2014sounds like Jeananne might be having an asthma attack. There\u2019s the key to the drug box. I wrote down the number for my pager\u2014cell phones aren\u2019t worth a damn out here. If any patients wander in while I\u2019m gone, you can take care of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you just wanted me to babysit,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou came here to work, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want me,\u201d she pointed out to him.</p><p>\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want us, either, but here we are. Let\u2019s see what you got.\u201d He shrugged on his jacket and picked up his bag. Then jutted his chin toward her, lifted his eyebrows as if to say, Well?</p><p>\u201cDo you have appointments today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only make appointments on Wednesdays\u2014the rest are walk-ins. Or call-outs, like this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even know what to charge,\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d he said. \u201cHardly matters\u2014these people aren\u2019t made of money and damn few have insurance. Just make sure you keep good records and I\u2019ll work it out. It\u2019s probably beyond you, anyway. You don\u2019t look all that bright.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve worked with some legendary assholes, but you\u2019re competing for first place here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cThat figures,\u201d she answered tiredly. \u201cIncidentally, the night was fine.\u201d</p><p>No comment from the old goat. He started for the door and on his way out, grabbed a cane. \u201cAre you limping?\u201d Mel asked him.</p><p>\u201cArthritis,\u201d he said. He dug an antacid out of his pocket and popped it in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cAnd heartburn. Got any more questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Mel got a bottle ready and while it was in the microwave, she went upstairs to dress. By the time that was accomplished, the baby started to stir. She changed her and picked her up and found herself saying, \u201cSweet Chloe, sweet baby...\u201d If she and Mark had had a girl, she was to be Chloe. A boy would be Adam. What was she doing?</p><p>\u201cBut you have to be someone, don\u2019t you?\u201d she told the baby. When she was coming down the stairs, the baby swaddled and held against her shoulder, Jack was opening the front door. He was balancing a covered dish on his hand, a thermos tucked under his arm. \u201cSorry, Jack\u2014you just missed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is for you. Doc stopped by the bar and said I\u2019d better get you some breakfast, that you were pretty cranky.\u201d</p><p>She laughed in spite of herself. \u201cI\u2019m cranky, huh? He\u2019s a giant pain in the ass! How do you put up with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe reminds me of my grandfather. How\u2019d it go last night? She sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did very well. Only woke up a couple of times. I\u2019m just about to feed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I give her a bottle while you eat. I brought coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, I didn\u2019t know they made men like you,\u201d she said, letting him follow her into the kitchen. When he put down the plate and thermos, she handed over the baby and tested the bottle. \u201cYou seem very comfortable with a newborn. For a man. A man with some nieces in Sacramento.\u201d He just smiled at her. She passed him the bottle and got out two coffee mugs. \u201cEver married?\u201d she asked him, then instantly regretted it. It was going to lead to him asking her.</p><p>\u201cI was married to the Marine Corps,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd she was a real bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many years?\u201d she asked, pouring coffee.</p><p>\u201cJust over twenty years. I went in as a kid. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was never in the marines,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cMarried?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t meet his eyes and lie, so she concentrated on the coffee mug. \u201cI was married to a hospital, and my bitch was as mean as your bitch.\u201d That wasn\u2019t a total lie. Mark used to complain about the schedules they kept\u2014grueling. He was in emergency medicine. He\u2019d just finished a thirty-six hour shift when he stopped at the convenience store, interrupting the robbery. She shuddered involuntarily. She pushed a mug toward him. \u201cDid you see a lot of combat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA lot of combat,\u201d he answered, directing the bottle into the baby\u2019s mouth expertly.</p><p>\u201cSomalia, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq. Twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder you just want to fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty years in the marines will make a fisherman out of just about anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem too young to have retired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m forty. I decided it was time to get out when I got shot in the butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. Complete recovery?\u201d she asked, then surprised herself by feeling her cheeks grow warm.</p><p>He lifted a corner of his mouth. \u201cExcept for the dimple. Wanna see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, no. So, Doc left me in charge and I have no idea what to expect. Maybe you should tell me where the nearest hospital is\u2014and do they provide ambulance service to the town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be Valley Hospital\u2014and they have ambulance service, but it takes so long to get here, Doc usually fires up his old truck and makes the run himself. If you\u2019re desperate and have about an hour to spare, the Grace Valley doctors have an ambulance, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen an ambulance in this town since I\u2019ve been here. I heard the helicopter came for the guy who almost died in the truck accident. I think the helicopter got as much notice as the accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope these people are healthy until he gets back,\u201d she said. Mel dug into the eggs. This seemed to be a Spanish omelet, and it was just as delicious as the one she\u2019d eaten the day before. \u201cMmm,\u201d she said appreciatively. \u201cHere\u2019s another thing\u2014I can\u2019t get any cell phone reception here. I should let my family know I\u2019m here safely. More or less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pines are too tall, the mountains too steep. Use the land line\u2014and don\u2019t worry about the long distance cost. You have to be in touch with your family. Who is your family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust an older married sister in Colorado Springs. She and her husband put up a collective and huge fuss about this\u2014as if I was going into the Peace Corps or something. I should\u2019ve listened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be a lot of people around here glad you didn\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m stubborn that way.\u201d</p><p>He smiled appreciatively.</p><p>It made her instantly think, don\u2019t get any ideas, buster. I\u2019m married to someone. Just because he isn\u2019t here, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s over.</p><p>However, there was something about a guy\u2014at least six foot two and two hundred pounds of rock-hard muscle\u2014holding a newborn with gentle deftness and skill. Then she saw him lower his lips to the baby\u2019s head and inhale her scent, and some of the ice around Mel\u2019s broken heart started to melt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going into Eureka today for supplies,\u201d he said. \u201cNeed anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisposable diapers. Newborn. And since you know everyone, could you ask around if anyone can help out with the baby? Either full-time, part-time, whatever. It would be better for her to be in a family home than here at Doc\u2019s with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he said, \u201cyou want to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help out with the baby for a couple of days, but I don\u2019t want to stretch it out. I can\u2019t stay here, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask around,\u201d he said. And decided he might just forget to do that. Because, yes, she could.</p><p>Little baby Chloe had only been asleep thirty minutes after her morning bottle when the first patient of the day arrived. A healthy and scrubbed looking young farm girl wearing overalls in the middle of which protruded a very large pregnant tummy, carrying two large jars of what appeared to be preserved blackberries. She put the berries on the floor just inside the door. \u201cI heard there was a new lady doctor in town,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI\u2019m a nurse practitioner.\u201d</p><p>Her face fell in disappointment. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought it would be so nice to have a woman doctor around when it\u2019s time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cTime?\u201d Mel asked. \u201cTo deliver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I like Doc, don\u2019t get me wrong. But\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen are you due?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>She rubbed her swollen belly. \u201cI think about a month, but I\u2019m not really sure,\u201d she said. She wore laced-up work boots, a yellow sweater underneath the overalls and her brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail. She looked twenty years old, at most. \u201cIt\u2019s my first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a midwife, as well,\u201d Mel said, and the young woman\u2019s face lit up in a beautiful smile. \u201cBut I have to warn you\u2014I\u2019m only here temporarily. I\u2019m planning to leave as soon as\u2014\u201d She thought about what she should say. Then, instead of explaining about the baby, she said, \u201cHave you had a checkup recently? Blood pressure, weight, et cetera?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a few weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess I\u2019m about due.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we do that since you\u2019re here, if I can find what I need,\u201d Mel said. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPolly Fishburn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you have a chart around here somewhere,\u201d Mel said. She went behind the counter and started opening file drawers. A brief search turned up a chart. She went in search of litmus, and other obstetric supplies in the exam room. \u201cCome on back, Polly,\u201d she called. \u201cWhen was the last time you had an internal exam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since the very first,\u201d she said. She made a face. \u201cI was dreading the next one.\u201d</p><p>Mel smiled, thinking about Doc\u2019s bent and arthritic fingers. That couldn\u2019t be pleasant.</p><p>\u201cWant me to have a look? See if you\u2019re doing anything, like dilating or effacing? It might save you having Doc do it later. Just get undressed, put on this little gown, and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Mel checked on the baby, who was napping in the kitchen, then went back to her patient. Polly appeared to be in excellent health with normal weight gain, good blood pressure, and...\u201cOh, boy, Polly. Baby\u2019s head is down.\u201d Mel stood and pressed down on her tummy while her fingers stretched toward the young woman\u2019s cervix.</p> <p>\u201cAnd...You\u2019re just barely dilated and effaced about fifty percent. You\u2019re having a small contraction right now. Can you feel that tightening? Braxton Hicks contractions.\u201d She smiled at her patient. \u201cWhere are you having the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2014I think.\u201d</p><p>Mel laughed. \u201cIf you do that anytime soon, we\u2019re going to be roommates. I\u2019m staying upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you think it\u2019ll come?\u201d Polly asked.</p><p>\u201cOne to four weeks, and that\u2019s just a guess,\u201d she said. She stepped back and snapped off her gloves.</p><p>\u201cWill you deliver the baby?\u201d Polly asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, Polly\u2014I\u2019m planning to leave as soon as it\u2019s reasonable. But if I\u2019m still here when you go into labor, and if Doc says it\u2019s okay, I\u2019d be more than happy to.\u201d She put out a hand to help Polly sit up. \u201cGet dressed. I\u2019ll see you out front.\u201d</p><p>When she walked out of the exam room and back toward the front of the house, she found the waiting room was full of people.</p> <p>By the end of the day Mel had seen over thirty patients, at least twenty-eight of whom just wanted a look at \u201cthe new lady doctor.\u201d They wanted to visit, ask her questions about herself, bring her welcome gifts.</p><p>It was at once a huge surprise to her, and also what she had secretly expected when she took the job.</p><p>By six o\u2019clock, Mel was exhausted, but the day had flown. She held the baby on her shoulder, gently jiggling her. \u201cHave you had anything to eat?\u201d she asked Doc Mullins.</p><p>\u201cWhen, during our open house, would I have eaten?\u201d he shot back. But it was not nearly as sarcastic as Mel imagined he wished it to be.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to walk across the street while I feed the baby?\u201d she asked. \u201cBecause after you and little Chloe have eaten, I really need some fresh air. No, make that\u2014I\u2019m desperate for a change of scenery. And I haven\u2019t eaten since breakfast.\u201d</p><p>He put out his old, gnarled hands. \u201cChloe?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cShe has to be called something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll see that she\u2019s fed. Then I\u2019ll poke around here for something.\u201d</p><p>She handed over the baby with a smile. \u201cI know you\u2019re trying to act miserable and just can\u2019t pull it off,\u201d she said. \u201cBut thank you\u2014I\u2019d really like to get out of here for an hour.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed her jacket off the peg by the front door and stepped out into the spring night. Out here, away from the smog and industry of city life, there were at least a million more stars. She took a deep breath. She wondered if a person actually got used to air like this\u2014so much cleaner than the smog of L.A., it shocked the lungs. There were quite a few people at Jack\u2019s\u2014unlike that stormy night when she\u2019d arrived. Two women she\u2019d met earlier in the day were there with their husbands\u2014Connie and Ron of the corner store, and Connie\u2019s best friend Joy and husband Bruce. Bruce, she learned, delivered the mail and was also the person who would take any specimens to the lab at Valley Hospital, if needed. They introduced her to Carrie and Fish Bristol and Doug and Sue Carpenter. There were a couple of guys at the bar and another two at a table playing cribbage\u2014by their canvas vests she took them for fishermen. Mel hung up her jacket, gave her sweater a little tug to bring it over the waist of her jeans, and popped up on a bar stool. She did not realize she was wearing a smile. That her eyes shone. They had all come out to see her, welcome her, tell her about themselves, ask her for advice. When the day was full of people who needed her\u2014</p><p>even those who weren\u2019t necessarily sick\u2014it filled her up inside. Passed for happiness, if she dared go that far.</p><p>\u201cLot of action across the street today, I hear,\u201d Jack said, giving the bar a wipe at her place.</p><p>\u201cYou were closed,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI had things to do\u2014and so did Preacher. We stay open most of the time, but if something comes up, we put up a sign and try to get back by dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf something comes up?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLike fishing,\u201d Preacher said, putting a rack of glasses under the bar, then he went back to the kitchen. Out of the back came the kid, Ricky, bussing tables. When he spied Mel he grinned hugely and came over to the bar with his tray of dishes. \u201cMiss Monroe\u2014you still here? Awesome.\u201d Then he went to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHe is too cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him hear you say that,\u201d Jack advised. \u201cHe\u2019s at the crush age. A very dangerous sixteen. What do you feel like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know\u2014I wouldn\u2019t mind a cold beer,\u201d she said. And it instantly appeared before her. \u201cWhat\u2019s for dinner?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMeat loaf,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the best mashed potatoes you\u2019ll ever experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything like a menu, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. We get whatever Preacher\u2019s in the mood to fix. You wanna enjoy that beer for a minute? Or, you want your supper fast?\u201d</p><p>She took a pull. \u201cGive me a minute.\u201d She took another sip and said, \u201cAhhh.\u201d It made Jack smile. \u201cI think I met half the town today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close. But the ones who came out today will spread the word about you. Have any real patients, or were they all just checking you out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a couple. You know, I really didn\u2019t have to come over here\u2014the house is full of food. When they come, they bring food, whether they\u2019re really sick or not. Pies, cakes, sliced meat, fresh bread. It\u2019s very...country.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cCareful,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll grow on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have any use for a couple of jars of canned berries? I think it was a patient fee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet. Preacher makes the best pies in the county. Any news about the baby\u2019s mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call the baby Chloe,\u201d she said, expecting a sting of tears that, remarkably, didn\u2019t come. \u201cNo. Nothing. I hope the woman who gave birth isn\u2019t sick somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the way everyone around here knows everyone\u2019s business, if there were a sick woman out there, word would get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she did come from another town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look almost happy,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI almost am,\u201d she returned. \u201cThe young woman who brought the berries asked me to deliver her baby. That was nice. The only problem seems to be that she\u2019s going to be having her baby in my bedroom. And she could be doing that pretty soon, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cPolly. She looks like that baby\u2019s ready to fall out of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know? Oh, never mind\u2014everyone knows everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t that many pregnant women around,\u201d he laughed. She turned on her stool and looked around. Two old women were eating meat loaf at a table by the fire and the couples she had met, all in their forties or fifties, seemed to be socializing; laughing and gossiping. There were perhaps a dozen patrons. \u201cBusiness is pretty good tonight, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t come out in the rain so much. Busy putting buckets under the leaks, I suppose. So\u2014still feel like getting the hell out of here?\u201d</p><p>She drank a little of her beer, noting that on an empty stomach the effects were instantaneous. And, actually, delightful. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to leave, if for no other reason than there\u2019s nowhere around here to get highlights put in my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are beauty shops around here. In Virgin River, Dot Schuman does hair in her garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds intriguing.\u201d She lifted her eyes to his face and said, \u201cI\u2019m getting a buzz. Maybe I better do that meat loaf.\u201d She hiccupped and they both laughed. By seven, Hope McCrea had wandered in and took the stool next to her. \u201cHeard you had a lot of company today,\u201d she said. She pulled her cigarettes out of her purse and as she was going to shake one out, Mel grabbed her wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou have to wait until I\u2019m done with dinner, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, foo\u2014you\u2019re a killjoy.\u201d She put the pack down. \u201cThe usual,\u201d she ordered. And to Mel, \u201cSo\u2014how was it? Your first real day? Doc scare you off yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was absolutely manageable. He even let me put in a couple of stitches. Of course, he didn\u2019t compliment my work, but he didn\u2019t tell me it was bad, either.\u201d She leaned closer to Hope and said, \u201cI think he\u2019s taking credit for me. You might want to stand up for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m staying a few days, at least. Until we get a couple of things that need attention ironed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard. Newborn, they say.\u201d</p><p>Jack put a drink down in front of Hope. \u201cJack Daniel\u2019s, neat,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHave any ideas on the mother?\u201d Mel asked Hope.</p><p>\u201cNo. But everyone is looking at everyone else strangely. If she\u2019s around here, she\u2019ll turn up. You done pushing food around that plate yet? Because I\u2019m ready for a smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t, you know.\u201d</p><p>Hope McCrea looked at Mel in impatience, grimacing. She pushed her too-big glasses up on her nose. \u201cWhat the hell do I care now? I\u2019ve already lived longer than I expected to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense. You have many good years left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. I hope not!\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed and in spite of herself, so did Mel.</p><p>Hope, acting like a woman with a million things to do, had her drink and cigarette, put money on the bar, hopped off the stool and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch. I can help out with the little one, if you need me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t smoke around the baby,\u201d Mel informed her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I could help out for hours and hours,\u201d she answered. \u201cKeep that in mind.\u201d And off she went, stopping at a couple of tables to pass the time on her way out.</p> <p>\u201cHow late do you stay open?\u201d Mel asked Jack.</p><p>\u201cWhy? You thinking about a nightcap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight. I\u2019m bushed. For future reference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI usually close around nine\u2014but if someone asks me to stay open, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the most accommodating restaurant I\u2019ve ever frequented,\u201d she laughed. She looked at her watch. \u201cI better spell Doc. I don\u2019t know how patient he is with an infant. I\u2019ll see you at breakfast, unless Doc\u2019s out on a house call.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be here,\u201d he offered.</p><p>Mel said goodbye and on her way to her coat, stopped at a couple of the tables to say good night to people she had just met. \u201cThink she\u2019ll stay on awhile?\u201d Preacher quietly asked Jack.</p><p>Jack was frowning. \u201cI think what she does to a pair of jeans ought to be against the law.\u201d He looked at Preacher. \u201cYou okay here? I\u2019m thinking of having a beer in Clear River.\u201d</p><p>It was code. There was a woman in Clear River. \u201cI\u2019m okay here,\u201d Preacher said. As Jack drove the half hour to Clear River, he wasn\u2019t thinking about Charmaine, which gave him a twinge of guilt. Tonight he was thinking about another woman. A very beautiful young blond woman who could just about bring a man to his knees with what she looked like in boots and jeans.</p><p>Jack had gone to a tavern in Clear River for a beer a couple of years ago and struck up a conversation with the waitress there\u2014Charmaine. She was the divorced mother of a couple of grown kids. A good woman; hardworking. Fun-loving and flirtatious. After several visits and as many beers, she took him home with her and he fell into her as if she were a feather bed. Then he told her what he always made sure women understood about him\u2014that he was not the kind of man who could ever be tied down to a woman, and if she began to have those designs, he\u2019d be gone.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think all women want to be run by some man?\u201d she had asked. \u201cI just got rid of one. Not about to get myself hooked up to another one.\u201d Then she smiled and said, \u201cJust the same, everyone gets a little lonely sometimes.\u201d</p> <p>They started an affair that had sustained Jack for a couple of years now. Jack didn\u2019t see her that often\u2014every week, maybe couple of weeks. Sometimes a month would go by. He wasn\u2019t sure what she did when he wasn\u2019t around\u2014maybe there were other men\u2014though he\u2019d never seen any evidence of that. He never caught her making time in the bar with anyone else; never saw any men\u2019s things around her house. He kept a box of condoms in her bedside drawer that didn\u2019t disappear on him, and he\u2019d let it slip that he liked being the only man she entertained.</p><p>As for Jack\u2014he had a personal ethic about one woman at a time. Sometimes that woman could last a year, sometimes a night\u2014but he didn\u2019t have a collection he roved between. Although he wasn\u2019t exactly breaking that rule tonight, he wasn\u2019t quite sticking to it, either.</p><p>He never spent the night in Clear River and Charmaine was not invited to Virgin River. She had only called him and asked him to come to her twice\u2014and it seemed a small thing to ask. After all, he wasn\u2019t the only one who needed to be with someone once in a while.</p><p>He liked that when he walked in the tavern and she saw him, it showed all over her that she was happy he\u2019d come. He suspected she had stronger feelings for him than she let show. He owed her\u2014she\u2019d been a real sport about it\u2014but he knew he\u2019d have to leave the relationship before it got any more entangled. So sometimes, to demonstrate he had a few gentlemanly skills, he\u2019d drop in for just a beer. Sometimes he\u2019d bring her something, like a scarf or earrings.</p><p>He sat down at the bar and she brought him a beer. She fluffed her hair; she was a big blonde. Bleached blonde. At about five foot eight, she\u2019d kept her figure, mostly. He didn\u2019t know her exact age, but he suspected late forties, early fifties. She always wore very tight-fitting clothes and tops that accentuated her full breasts. At first sight you\u2019d think\u2014cheap. Not so much tawdry or low-class as simple. Unrefined. But once you got to know Charmaine and how kind and deep down earnest she was, those thoughts fled. Jack imagined that in younger years she was quite the looker with her ample chest and full lips. She hadn\u2019t really lost those good looks, but she had a little extra weight around the hips and there were wrinkles at the corners of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHiya, bub,\u201d she said. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen you in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been a couple of weeks, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like four.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019ve you been?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBusy. Working. Went over to Eureka to see my daughter last week. She\u2019s having herself a lousy marriage\u2014but what should we expect? I raised her in one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe getting divorced?\u201d he asked politely, though in truth he didn\u2019t care that much. He didn\u2019t know her kids.</p><p>\u201cNo. But she should. Let me get this table. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>She left him to make sure the other customers were served. There were only a few and once Jack showed up the owner, Butch, knew that Charmaine would want to leave a little early. He saw her take a tray of glasses back behind the bar and talk quietly with her boss, who nodded. Then Charmaine was back.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to have a beer and say hello,\u201d Jack said. \u201cThen I have to get back. I have a big project going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fixing up a cabin for one of the women in town. I put on a new porch today and tomorrow I\u2019m going to paint it and build back steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat so? Pretty woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you could say she\u2019s pretty. For seventy-six years old.\u201d</p><p>She laughed loudly. Charmaine had a big laugh. It was a good laugh that came from deep inside her. \u201cWell, then, I guess I won\u2019t bother being jealous. But do you think you can spare the time to walk me home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d he said, draining his beer. \u201cBut I\u2019m not coming in tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll get my coat.\u201d</p><p>When they were outside, she looped her arm through his and began to talk about her last couple of weeks, as she always did. He liked the sound of her voice, deep and a little raspy, what they called a whiskey voice though she wasn\u2019t much of a drinker. She could go on and on about next to nothing but in a pleasant way, not an irritating way. She would talk about the bar, the people in the town, her kids, what she\u2019d bought lately, what she\u2019d read. News items fascinated her\u2014she would spend the mornings before work watching CNN, and she liked to tell him her opinion of breaking stories. She always had some project going on in her little house\u2014wallpaper or paint or new appliances. The house was paid for; an inheritance of some kind. So the money she made, she spent on herself and her kids.</p><p>When they got to the door he said, \u201cI\u2019ll shove off, Charmaine. But I\u2019ll see you before long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Jack,\u201d she said. She tilted her head up for a kiss and he obliged. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t much of a kiss,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to come in tonight,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou must be awful tired,\u201d she said. \u201cThink you have enough energy to give me a kiss that I\u2019ll remember for an hour or two?\u201d</p><p>He tried again. This time he covered her mouth with his, allowed his tongue to do a little exploring, held her close against him. And she grabbed his butt. Damn! he thought. She ground against him a little bit, sucked on his tongue. Then she hooked her hand into the front of his jeans and pulled him forward, letting her fingers drift lower against his belly.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said weakly, a little vulnerable, stirred up. \u201cI\u2019ll come in for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my boy,\u201d she said, smiling at him. She pushed open the door and he followed her inside. \u201cJust think of it as a little sleeping pill.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his jacket on the chair. Charmaine wasn\u2019t even out of hers when he grabbed her around the waist, pulled her against him and devoured her with a kiss that was sudden, hot and needy. He pushed her jacket off her shoulders and walked her backwards toward the bedroom and dropped with her onto the bed. He pulled at her top and freed her breasts, filling his mouth with one and then the other. Then off came her pants, and down came his. He ran his hands over her lush body, down over her shoulders, hips, thighs. He reached over to the bedside table, retrieved one of the condoms kept there for him, and ripped the package open. He put it on and was inside her so quickly, it startled even him. He thrust and plunged and drove and she said,</p><p>\u201cOh! Oh! Oh, my God!\u201d</p><p>He was ready to explode, but held himself back while her legs came around his waist and she bucked. Something happened to him\u2014he went a little out of his mind. Didn\u2019t know where he was or with whom. When she finally tightened around him, he let himself go with a loud groan. She panted beneath him, the sound that told him she was completely satisfied.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d she said when she finally caught her breath. \u201cWhat\u2019s got you so hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, you don\u2019t even have your boots off!\u201d</p><p>He was shocked for a moment, then rolled off of her. Jesus, he thought. You can\u2019t treat a woman like that. He might not have been thinking, but at least he wasn\u2019t thinking about anyone else, he consoled himself. He had no brain power involved in that at all\u2014it was all visceral. His body, reaching out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Charmaine. You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m way more than okay. But please, take your boots off and hold me.\u201d</p><p>It was on his mind to say he had to go, he wanted to go, but he couldn\u2019t do that to her after this. He sat up and got rid of the boots and pants and shirt, everything hitting the floor. After a quick visit to the bathroom he was back, scooped her up in his arms and held her. Her heavy, soft body was cushiony against his.</p><p>He stroked her, kissed her and eventually made love to her again, as opposed to what he\u2019d done before. This time sanely, but no less satisfactorily. At one in the morning he was searching around the floor for his pants.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might be staying the night this time,\u201d she said from the bed. He pulled on his pants and sat on the bed to put on his boots. He twisted around and gave her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019ll be fine now.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cThink of it as a little sleeping pill.\u201d</p><p>As he drove back to Virgin River he thought, it\u2019s over now. I have to end it. I can\u2019t do that anymore, not with a clear conscience. Not when something else has my attention.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>J ack drove out to the cabin, the truck bed loaded with supplies. It was his third day in a row. When he pulled up, Cheryl came out of the house, onto the new porch. \u201cHey, Cheryl,\u201d he called. \u201cHow\u2019s it going? Almost done in there?\u201d</p><p>She had a rag in her hands. \u201cI need the rest of the day. It was a real pigsty. Will you be here tomorrow, too?\u201d</p><p>He would. But he said, \u201cNah. I\u2019m about done. I want to paint the porch this morning\u2014can you get out the back door? I haven\u2019t built steps yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can jump down. Whatcha got?\u201d She came down the porch steps.</p><p>\u201cJust stuff for the cabin,\u201d he said, unloading a big Adirondack chair for the porch, its twin in the truck bed.</p><p>\u201cWow. You really went all out,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must be some nurse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says she\u2019s not staying, but the place has to be fixed up anyway. I told Hope I\u2019d make sure it was taken care of.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cNot everyone would go to so much trouble. You\u2019re really a good guy, Jack,\u201d she said. She peeked into the truck. He had a new double-size mattress inside a large plastic bag lying flat in the bed. On top of that, a large rolled-up rug for the living room, bags from Target full of linens and towels that were new as opposed to the graying, used ones borrowed from Hope\u2019s linen closet, potted geraniums for the front porch, lumber for the back step, paint, a box full of new kitchen things. \u201cThis is a lot more than repair stuff,\u201d she said. She tucked a strand of hair that had escaped her clip around her ear. When he chanced a glance at her, he saw those sad eyes filled with longing. He looked away quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhy go halfway?\u201d he said. \u201cIt ought to be nice. When she leaves, maybe Hope can rent it out to summer people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jack continued unloading while Cheryl just stood around. He tried to ignore her; he didn\u2019t even make small talk.</p><p>Cheryl was a tall, big-boned woman of just thirty, but she didn\u2019t look so good\u2014she\u2019d been drinking pretty hard since she was a teenager. Her complexion was ruddy, her hair thin and listless, her eyes red-rimmed and droopy. She had a lot of extra weight around the middle from the booze. Every now and then she\u2019d sober up for a couple of weeks or months, but invariably she\u2019d fall back into the bottle. She still lived with her parents, who were at their wits\u2019 end with her drinking. But what to do? She\u2019d get her hands on booze regardless. Jack never served her, but every time he happened upon her, like now, there was usually a telltale odor and half-mast eyes. She was holding it together pretty good today. She must not have had much.</p><p>There had been a bad incident a couple of years ago that Cheryl and Jack had had to get beyond. She had a little too much one night and went to his living quarters behind the bar, banging on his door in the middle of the night. When he opened the door, she flung herself on him, groping him and declaring her tragic love for him. Sadly for her, she remembered every bit of it. He caught her sober a few days later and said, \u201cNever. It is never going to happen. Get over it and don\u2019t do that again.\u201d And it made her cry. He moved on as best he could and was grateful that she did her drinking at home, not in his bar and grill. She liked straight vodka, probably right out of the bottle and, if she could get her hands on it, Everclear\u2014that really mean, potent stuff. It was illegal in most states, but liquor store owners usually had a little under the counter.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could be a nurse,\u201d Cheryl said.</p> <p>\u201cHave you ever thought about going back to school?\u201d he asked as he worked. He was careful not to give her the impression he was too interested. He hauled the rug out of the back of the truck, hefted it over his shoulder and carried it to the house. To his back she said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could if you got a job. You need a bigger town. Throw your net a little wider. Stop relying on odd jobs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d she said, following him. \u201cBut I like it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you? You don\u2019t seem that happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m happy sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. He threw the rolled rug down in the living room. He\u2019d spread it out later. \u201cIf you have the time, could you wash up those new linens I bought and put them away? Fix up the bed when I get the new mattress on it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Let me help you with the mattress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, and together they hauled it into the house. He leaned it against the wall and grabbed the old one off the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll go by the dump on the way home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard there was a baby at Doc\u2019s. Like a baby that was just left there.\u201d</p><p>Jack froze. Oh, man, he thought. Cheryl? Could it be Cheryl\u2019s? Without meaning to, he looked her up and down. She was big, but not obese. Yet fat around the middle and her shirt loose and baggy. But she\u2019d been out here cleaning that very day\u2014she couldn\u2019t do that, could she? Maybe it wasn\u2019t the Smirnoff flu. Wouldn\u2019t she be bleeding and leaking milk? Weak and tired?</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he finally said. \u201cYou hear of anyone who could have done that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Is it an Indian baby? Because there\u2019s reservations around here\u2014women on hard times. You know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhite,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cYou know, when I\u2019m done here, I could help out with the baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh, I think that\u2019s covered, Cheryl. But thanks. I\u2019ll tell Doc.\u201d He carried the old mattress out and leaned it against the truck bed. God, that was an awful-looking thing. Mel was completely right\u2014that cabin was horrific. What had Hope been thinking?</p><p>She\u2019d been thinking it would be cleaned up\u2014but had she expected the new nurse to sleep on that thing? Sometimes Hope could be oblivious to details like these. She was pretty much just a crusty old broad.</p><p>He reached into the truck and hauled out the bags of linens. \u201cHere you go,\u201d he said to Cheryl. \u201cNow get inside\u2014I have to start painting. I want to get back to the bar by dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, accepting the bags. \u201cLet me know if Doc needs me. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Cheryl.\u201d Never, he thought. Too risky.</p><p>Jack was back at the bar by midafternoon with time enough to do an inventory of bar stock before people started turning out for dinner. The bar was empty, as it often was at this time of day. Preacher was in the back getting started on his evening meal and Ricky wasn\u2019t due for another hour at least.</p><p>A man came into the bar alone. He wasn\u2019t dressed as a fisherman; he wore jeans, a tan T-shirt under a denim vest, his hair was on the long side and he had a ball cap on his head. He was a big guy with a stubble of beard about a week old. He sat several stools down from where Jack stood with his clipboard and inventory paperwork, a good indication he didn\u2019t want to talk.</p><p>Jack walked down to him. \u201cHi. Passing through?\u201d he asked, slapping a napkin down in front of him.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d the man answered. \u201cHow about a beer and a shot. Heineken and Beam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it,\u201d Jack said, setting him up.</p><p>The man threw back the shot right away, then lifted the beer, all without making any eye contact with Jack. Fine, we won\u2019t talk, Jack thought. I have things to do anyway. So Jack went back to counting bottles.</p><p>About ten minutes had passed when he heard, \u201cHey, buddy. Once more, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d Jack said, serving him another round. Again silence prevailed. The man took a little longer on his beer, time enough for Jack to get a good bit of his inventory done. While he was crouched behind the bar, a shadow fell over him and he looked up to see the man standing right on the other side of the bar, ready to settle up. Jack stood just as the man was reaching into his pocket. He noticed a bit of tattoo sneaking out from the sleeve of his shirt\u2014the recognizable feet of a bulldog\u2014the Devil Dog. Jack was close to remarking on it\u2014the man wore an unmistakable United States Marine Corps tattoo. But then the man pulled a thick wad of bills out, peeled off a hundred and said, \u201cCan you change this?\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t even have to touch the bill; the skunklike odor of green cannabis wafted toward him. The man had just done some cutting\u2014pruning or harvesting and, from the stinky cash, had made a sale. Jack could change the bill, but he didn\u2019t want to advertise how much cash he kept on hand and he didn\u2019t want that money on the premises. There were plenty of growers out there\u2014some with prescriptions for legal use, conscious of the medical benefits. There were those who thought of marijuana as just any old plant, like corn. Agriculture. A way to make money. And some who dealt drugs because the drugs would offer a big profit. This part of the country was often referred to as the Emerald Triangle for the three counties most known for the cannabis trade. Lots of nice, new, half-ton trucks being driven by people on a busboy\u2019s salary. Some of the towns around these parts catered to them, selling supplies illegal growers needed\u2014irrigation tubing, grow lights, camouflage tarps, plastic sheeting, shears in various sizes for harvesting and pruning. Scales, generators, ATVs for getting off-road and back into secretive hideaways buried in the forest. There were merchants around who displayed signs in their windows that said, CAMP Not Served Here. CAMP</p><p>being the Campaign Against Marijuana Planting that was a joint operation between the County Sheriff\u2019s Department and the state of California. Clear River was a town that didn\u2019t like CAMP and didn\u2019t mind taking the growers\u2019 money, of which there was a lot. Charmaine didn\u2019t approve of the illegal growing, but Butch wouldn\u2019t turn down a stinky bill.</p><p>Virgin River was not that kind of town.</p><p>Growers usually maintained low profiles and didn\u2019t cause problems, not wanting to be raided. But sometimes there were territorial conflicts between them or booby-trapped grows, either one of which could hurt an innocent citizen. There were drug-related crimes ranging from burglary or robbery to murder. Not so long ago they found the body of a grower\u2019s partner buried in the woods near Garberville; he\u2019d been missing for over two years and the grower himself had always been a suspect. You couldn\u2019t find anything in Virgin River that would encourage an illegal crop, one means of keeping them away. If there were any growers in town, they were real, real secret. Virgin River tended to push this sort away. But this wasn\u2019t the first one to pass by.</p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Jack said to the man, making long and serious eye contact. \u201cOn the house this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, folding his bill back onto the wad and stuffing it in his pocket. He turned to go.</p><p>\u201cAnd buddy?\u201d Jack called as the man reached the door to leave. He turned and Jack said, \u201cSheriff\u2019s deputy and California Highway Patrol eat and drink on the house in my place.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s shoulders rose once with a silent huff of laughter. He was on notice. He touched the brim of his hat and left.</p><p>Jack walked around the bar and looked out the window to see the man get into a black late model Range Rover, super-charged, big wheels jacked up real high, windows tinted, lights on the roof. That model would go for nearly a hundred grand. This guy was no hobbyist. He memorized the license plate.</p><p>Preacher was rolling out pie dough when Jack went into the kitchen. \u201cI just served a guy who tried to pay for his drinks with a wad of stinky Bens as big as my fist,\u201d Jack told him.</p><p>\u201cCrap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s driving a new Range Rover, loaded, jacked up and lit up. Big guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019s growing around town here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave no idea,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe better pay attention. Next time the deputy\u2019s in town, I\u2019ll mention it. But it\u2019s not against the law to have stinky money or drive a big truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s rich, it\u2019s probably not a small operation,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got a bulldog tattoo on his upper right arm.\u201d</p><p>Preacher frowned. \u201cYou kind of hate to see a brother go that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, tell me about it. Maybe he\u2019s not in business around here. He could have been just scoping out the town to see if this is a good place to set up. I think I sent the message that it\u2019s not. I told him law enforcement eats and drinks on the house.\u201d</p><p>Preacher smiled. \u201cWe should start doing that, then,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHow about a discount, to start? We don\u2019t want to get crazy.\u201d</p><p>Mel got her sister Joey on the phone.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus, Mel! You scared me to death! Where have you been? Why didn\u2019t you call sooner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in Virgin River where I have no phone and my cell doesn\u2019t work. And I\u2019ve been pretty busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was about to call out the National Guard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, don\u2019t bother. They\u2019d never be able to find the place.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...This will probably make you perversely happy,\u201d Mel told her. \u201cYou were right. I shouldn\u2019t have done this. I was nuts. As usual.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it terrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it definitely started out terrible\u2014the free housing turned out to be a fallingdown hovel and the doctor is a mean old coot who doesn\u2019t want any help in his practice. I was on my way out of town when\u2014you\u2019ll never believe this\u2014someone left an abandoned newborn on the doctor\u2019s porch. But things have improved, if slightly. I\u2019m staying for at least a few more days to help with the baby. The old doc wouldn\u2019t wake up to those middle-of-the-night hunger cries. Oh, Joey, my first impression of him is that he was the poorest excuse for a town doctor I\u2019d ever met. Mean as a snake, rude as sour milk. Fortunately, working with those L.A. medical residents, especially those dicky surgeons, prepared me nicely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that was your first impression. How has it changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe proves tractable. Since my housing was uninhabitable, I\u2019m staying in the guest room in his house. It\u2019s actually set up to be the only hospital room in town. This house is fine\u2014clean and functional. There could be a slight inconvenience at any moment\u2014</p><p>a young woman who asked me to deliver her first baby will be having it here\u2014in my bedroom, which I share with the abandoned baby. Picture this\u2014a post-partum patient and a full nursery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you will sleep where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll probably hang myself up in a corner and sleep standing up. But that\u2019s only if she delivers within the next week, while I\u2019m still here. Surely a family will turn up to foster this baby soon. Although, I wouldn\u2019t mind a birth. A sweet, happy birth to loving, excited, healthy parents...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay for that,\u201d Joey said firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though they don\u2019t have a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014but she\u2019s so young. And she was so happy, thinking there was a woman doctor here who could deliver her rather than this ornery old man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel, I want you to get in your car and drive. Come to us. Where we can look after you for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need looking after,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cWork helps. I need to work. Whole hours go by without thinking about Mark.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow are you doing with that?\u201d</p><p>She sighed deeply. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing. No one here knows, so no one looks at me with those sad, pitying eyes. And since they don\u2019t look at me that way, I don\u2019t crumble so often. At least, not where anyone can see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mel, I wish I could comfort you somehow...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Joey, I have to grieve this, it\u2019s the only way. And I have to live with the fact that I might never be over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope that\u2019s not true, Mel. I know widows. I know widows who have remarried and are happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going there,\u201d she said. Then Mel told Joey about what she knew of the town, about all the people who\u2019d been drifting into Doc\u2019s house just to get a look at her, about Jack and Preacher. And about how many more stars there were out here. The mountains; the air, so clean and sharp it almost took you by surprise. About the people who came to the doctor bringing things, like tons of food, a lot of which went right across the street to the bar where Preacher used it in his creations; about how Jack refused to take a dime from either Doc or Mel for food or drink. Anyone who cared for the town had a free meal ticket over there.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s very rural. Doc put in a call to the county social services agency, but I gather we\u2019re on a waiting list\u2014they may not figure out foster care for who knows how long. Frankly, I don\u2019t know how the old doc made it without any help all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople nice?\u201d Joey asked. \u201cOther than the doctor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe ones I\u2019ve met\u2014very. But the main reason I called, besides letting you know that I\u2019m safe, is to tell you I\u2019m on the old doc\u2019s phone\u2014the cell just isn\u2019t going to work out here. I\u2019ll give you the number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Joey said. \u201cAt least you sound okay. In fact, you sound better than you have in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said, there are patients. Challenges. I\u2019m a little keyed up. The very first day, I was left alone here with the baby and the key to the drug cabinet and told to see any patients who wandered in. No training, nothing. About thirty people came\u2014just to say hello and visit. That\u2019s what you hear in my voice. Adrenaline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdrenaline again. I thought you swore off.\u201d</p><p>Mel laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different brand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014when you wrap it up there, you\u2019ll come to Colorado Springs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any better ideas,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure. In a few days, hopefully. Couple of weeks at the outside. But I\u2019ll call you and let you know when I\u2019m on my way. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But you really do sound...up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere around here to get highlights. Some woman in town does hair in her garage, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God,\u201d Joey said. \u201cYou\u2019d better wrap it up before you get some ugly roots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>Wednesday, Appointment Day, came and Mel watched the baby and saw a few patients with only minor complaints. One sprained ankle, a bad cold, another prenatal exam, a well-baby check and immunizations. After that there were a couple of walkins\u2014she stitched up a laceration on a ten-year-old\u2019s head and Doc said, \u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><p>Doc made two house calls. They traded off babysitting to walk across the street to Jack\u2019s to eat. The people she met at the bar and those who came into the doctor\u2019s office were pleasant and welcoming. \u201cBut this is just temporary,\u201d she was careful to explain. \u201cDoc doesn\u2019t really need any help.\u201d</p><p>Mel put in an order for more diapers with Connie at the corner store. The store was no bigger than a minimart and Mel learned that the locals usually went to the nearest large town for their staples and feed for animals, using the store merely to grab those occasional missing items. There were sometimes hunters or fishermen looking for something. They had a little of everything\u2014from bottled water to socks. But only a few items of each.</p><p>\u201cI heard no one\u2019s turned up for that baby yet,\u201d Connie said. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone around here who\u2019d have a baby and give it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you think of anyone who\u2019d have a baby without any medical intervention of any kind? Especially since there\u2019s a doctor in town?\u201d</p><p>Connie, a cute little woman probably in her fifties, shrugged. \u201cWomen have their babies at home all the time, but Doc\u2019s usually there. We have some isolated families out in the woods\u2014hardly ever show their faces for anything.\u201d She leaned close and whispered. \u201cStrange people. But I\u2019ve lived here all my life and have never heard of them giving up their children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long do you expect the social services intervention to take?\u201d</p><p>Connie laughed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have the first idea. We run into a problem, we usually all pitch in. It\u2019s not like we ask for a lot of outside help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then, how long before you get in a new supply of disposable diapers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRon makes his supply run once a week, and he\u2019ll do that tomorrow morning. So, by tomorrow afternoon, you should be fixed up.\u201d</p><p>A teenage girl came into the store carrying her book bag\u2014the school bus must have just dropped off. \u201cAh, my Lizzie,\u201d Connie said. \u201cMel, this is my niece, Liz. She just got here\u2014she\u2019s going to stay with me for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you do?\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Liz said, smiling. Her full, long brown hair was teased up high and falling seductively to her shoulders, eyebrows beautifully arched over bright blue eyes, eye makeup thick, her glossy lips full and pouty. Little sex queen, Mel found herself thinking, in her short denim skirt, leather knee-high boots with heels, sweater tugged over full breasts and not meeting her waist. Belly-button ring, hmm. \u201cNeed me to work awhile?\u201d Liz asked Connie.</p><p>\u201cNo, honey. Go to the back and start your homework. Your first day was good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I guess.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cNice to meet you,\u201d she said, disappearing into the store\u2019s back room.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>Connie was frowning slightly. \u201cShe\u2019s fourteen.\u201d</p><p>Mel\u2019s eyes grew wide as she mouthed the words silently. Fourteen? \u201cWow,\u201d she whispered to Connie. The girl looked at least sixteen or even seventeen. She could pass for eighteen.</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019s why she\u2019s here. Her mother, my sister, is at the end of her rope with the little hot bottom. She\u2019s a wild one. But that was in Eureka. Not so many places to go wild around here.\u201d She smiled. \u201cIf I could just get her to cover her naked body, I would feel so much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear ya,\u201d Mel laughed. \u201cMay the force be with you.\u201d But I\u2019d consider birth control, Mel thought.</p><p>When Mel had her meals at the bar, if there was no one around she knew, like Connie or her best friend Joy, or Ron or Hope, she would sit up at the bar and talk to Jack while she ate. Sometimes he ate with her. During these meals she learned more about the town, about summer visitors who came for hiking and camping, the hunters and fishermen who passed through during the season\u2014the Virgin was great for fly fishing, a comment that made her giggle. And there was kayaking, which sounded like fun to her.</p><p>Ricky introduced her to his grandmother who made a rare dinner appearance. Lydie Sudder was over seventy and had that uncomfortable gait of one who suffered arthritis. \u201cYou have a very nice grandson,\u201d Mel observed. \u201cIs it just the two of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cI lost my son and daughter-in-law in an accident when he was just a little thing. I\u2019d sure worry about him if it weren\u2019t for Jack. He\u2019s been looking out for Ricky since he came to town. He looks after a lot of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can sense that about him,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>The March sun had warmed the land and brought out the buds. Mel had a fleeting thought that seeing this place in full bloom would be glorious, but then reminded herself that she would miss it. The baby\u2014little Chloe\u2014was thriving and several different women from town had stopped by to offer babysitting services. She realized that she\u2019d been here over a week\u2014and it had passed like minutes. Of course, never getting more than four hours of sleep at a stretch tended to speed up time. She\u2019d found living with Doc Mullins to be more bearable than she would\u2019ve thought. He could be a cantankerous old goat, but she could give it back to him just as well, something he seemed to secretly enjoy.</p><p>One day, when the baby was asleep and there were no patients or calls, Doc got out a deck of cards. He shuffled them in his hand and said, \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s see what you got.\u201d He sat down at the kitchen table and dealt the cards. \u201cGin,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAll I know about gin is that you mix it with tonic,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019ll play for money,\u201d he said.</p><p>She sat down at the table. \u201cYou plan to take advantage of me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he confirmed. And then with a smile so rare, he began to tell her how to play. Pennies for points, he told her. And within an hour she was laughing, winning, and Doc\u2019s expression was getting more sour by the minute, which only made her laugh harder. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said, dealing. \u201cLet\u2019s see what you got.\u201d</p><p>The sound of someone coming through the front door temporarily stopped the game and Mel said, \u201cSit tight, I\u2019ll see who it is.\u201d She patted his hand. \u201cGive you time to stack the deck.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Standing just inside the front door was a skinny man with a long graying beard. His overalls were dirty and the bottoms frayed around filthy boots. The edge of his shirt sleeves and collar were also frayed, as though he\u2019d been in these particular clothes a very long time. He didn\u2019t come into the house, probably because of the mud he tracked, but stood just inside the door twisting a very worn felt hat.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d she asked him.</p> <p>\u201cDoc here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Sure. Let me get him for you.\u201d</p><p>She fetched Doc to the front door and while he was chatting with the man, she checked on Chloe. When Doc finally came back to the kitchen, he was wearing a very unpleasant expression. \u201cWe have to make a call. See if you can rustle up someone to keep an eye on the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need my assistance?\u201d she asked, perhaps more hopefully than she wished.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think you should tag along. See what\u2019s on the other side of the tree line.\u201d</p> <p>Chloe stirred in her bed and Mel picked her up. \u201cWho was that man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClifford Paulis. Lives out in the woods with some people. His daughter and her man joined them a while back. They have regular problems. I\u2019d rather you just see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, perplexed.</p><p>After a few phone calls had been placed with no success, the best they could do for the baby was take her across the street to Jack\u2019s with a few diapers and a bottle. Mel carried her little bed while Doc managed the baby in one arm and his cane in the other hand, though Mel had offered to make two trips.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ll be all right?\u201d she asked Jack. \u201cYou might have to change her and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNieces,\u201d he said again. \u201cI\u2019m all checked out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow many nieces, exactly?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cEight, at last count. Four sisters and eight nieces. Apparently they can\u2019t breed sons. Where are you off to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaulises\u2019,\u201d Doc said. And Jack whistled.</p><p>As they drove out of town, Mel said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a good feeling about this. Seems everyone knows about this family except me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you deserve to be prepared. The Paulises live in a small compound of shacks and trailers with a few others\u2014a camp. They stay out of sight and drink a lot, wander into town very rarely. They keep a supply of pure grain alcohol on hand. They\u2019re dirtpoor, miserable folk, but they haven\u2019t given Virgin River any trouble. Clifford says there was a fight last night and there\u2019s some patching up to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pretty gritty folk. If they sent for me, it must\u2019ve been a good one.\u201d</p> <p>They drove a long way into the woods, the dirt road a narrow, bumpy, one lane before it finally broke open into a clearing around which were, as Doc had said, two shacks and a couple of trailers. Not mobile homes, but camper shells and an itty bitty trailer that had seen better days, along with an old wheelless pickup truck up on blocks. They circled an open area in the middle of which was a crude brick oven of sorts. There were tarps stretched out from the campers and shacks with actual furniture under them. Not outdoor furniture but household\u2014tables and chairs, old sofas with the stuffing popping out. Plus old tires, a couple of small trucks, unidentifiable junk, a wringer washer lying on its side. Mel peered into the trees and blinked to clear her vision. There appeared to be a semitrailer, half buried in the ground with camouflage tarps over the top. Beside it was, unmistakably, a gas-powered generator. Mel said, \u201cHoly shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp if you can,\u201d Doc said. \u201cBut try not to talk.\u201d He peered at her. \u201cThat\u2019ll be hard for you.\u201d</p><p>Doc got out of the truck, hefting his bag. People started to drift into the clearing\u2014not from within their homes, such as they were, but more like from behind them. There were just a few men. It was impossible to tell their ages; they all looked like vagrants with their dirty and worn dungarees and overalls. They were bearded, their hair long and matted, like real sad hillbillies. Everyone was thin with sallow complexions; they were not enjoying good health out here. There was a very bad smell and Mel thought about bathroom facilities. They would be using the forest; and it smelled as if they didn\u2019t get far enough from the camp. Their facilities were minimal. It was like a little third-world country.</p><p>Doc nodded to people as he pressed forward, getting nods back. He\u2019d obviously been here before. Mel followed more slowly. Doc ended up in front of a shack outside of which Clifford Paulis stood. Doc turned to make sure Mel was with him, then entered. She felt their eyes on her, but they kept their distance. She wasn\u2019t exactly afraid, but she was nervous and unsure and hurried behind Doc to enter the shack with him. There was a small table inside with a lantern on it. Sitting on short stools at the table were a man and a woman. Mel had to stifle a gasp. Their faces were swollen, cut and bruised. The man was perhaps thirty, his dirty blond hair short and spiky, and he twitched and jittered, unable to sit still. The woman, maybe the same age, was holding her arm at an odd angle. Broken.</p><p>Doc put his bag on the table and opened it. He pulled out and put on his latex gloves. Mel followed suit, but slowly, her pulse picking up. She had never worked as a visiting nurse, but knew a few who had. There were nasty hovels all around the poorer sections of L.A. where paramedics might be called, but in the city if you had a situation like this, you\u2019d notify the police. The patients would be brought to the emergency room. And in the event of domestic violence, which this clearly was, these two would both be booked into jail right out of the E.R. When there\u2019s an injury in a domestic, no one has to press charges besides the police.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha got, Maxine?\u201d he said, reaching out for her arm, which she extended toward him. He examined it briefly. \u201cClifford,\u201d he called. \u201cI\u2019m gonna need a bucket of water.\u201d Then to Mel he said, \u201cGet to work on cleaning up Calvin\u2019s face, see if sutures are required, and I\u2019ll attempt to set this ulna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want a hypo?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need that,\u201d he said.</p><p>Mel got out some peroxide and cotton and approached the young man warily. He lifted his eyes to her face and grinned at her with a mouth full of dirty teeth, some of which appeared to be rotting. In his eyes she saw that his pupils were very small\u2014he was full of amphetamine, higher than a kite. He kept grinning at her and she tried not to make eye contact with him. She cleaned some of the cuts on his face and finally said, \u201cWipe that look off your face or I\u2019ll let Doc do this.\u201d It made him giggle stupidly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need something for the pain,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou already had something for the pain,\u201d she told him. And he giggled again. But in his eyes there was menace and she decided not to make any more eye contact. Doc made a sudden movement that slammed Calvin\u2019s arm onto the table, hard, gripped by Doc\u2019s arthritic hand. \u201cYou never do that, you hear me?\u201d Doc said in a voice more threatening than Mel had heard before, then slowly released Calvin\u2019s forearm while boring through him with angry eyes. Then Doc immediately turned his attention back to Maxine. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to put this bone right, Maxine. Then I\u2019ll cast it for you.\u201d</p><p>Mel had no idea what had just happened. \u201cYou don\u2019t want an X-ray?\u201d she heard herself ask Doc. And her answer was a glare from the doctor who\u2019d asked her to try not to talk. She went back to the man\u2019s face.</p><p>There was a cut over his eye that she could repair with tape, no stitches required. Standing above him as she was, she noticed a huge purple bump through the thinning hair on the top of his head. Maxine must have hit him over the head with something, right before he broke her arm. She glanced at his shoulders and arms through the thin fabric of his shirt and saw that he had some heft to him\u2014he was probably strong. Strong enough at least break a bone.</p><p>The bucket of water arrived\u2014the bucket rusty and dirty\u2014and momentarily she heard Maxine give out a yelp of pain as Doc used sudden and powerful force to put her ulna back into place.</p><p>Old Doc Mullins worked silently, wrapping an Ace bandage around her arm, then dipping casting material into the bucket, soaking it, and applying it to the broken arm. Finished with her assignment, Mel moved away from Calvin and watched Doc. He was strong and fast for his age, skilled for a man with hands twisted by arthritis, but then this had been his life\u2019s work. Casting done, he pulled a sling out of his bag. Job done, he snapped off his gloves, threw them in his bag, closed it, picked it up and, looking down, went back to the truck. Again, Mel followed. When they were out of the compound she said, \u201cAll right\u2014what\u2019s going on there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt isn\u2019t complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks pretty awful to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt is awful. But not complicated. Just a few dirt-poor alcoholics. Homeless, living in the woods. Clifford wandered away from his family to live out here years ago and over time a few others joined his camp. Then Calvin Thompson and Maxine showed up not so long ago, and added weed to the agenda\u2014they\u2019re growing in that semitrailer. Biggest mystery to me is how they got it back in here. You can bet Calvin couldn\u2019t get that done. I figure Calvin\u2019s connected to someone, told \u2019em he could sit back here and watch over a grow. Calvin\u2019s a caretaker. That\u2019s what the generator is about\u2014grow lights. They irrigate out of the river. Calvin\u2019s jitters don\u2019t come from pot\u2014pot would level him out and slow him down. He\u2019s gotta be on something like meth. Maybe he skims a little marijuana, cheats the boss, and trades it for something else. Thing is, I don\u2019t think Clifford and those old men have anything to do with the pot. They never had a grow out there before that I know of. But I could be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere are lots of little marijuana camps hidden back in these woods\u2014some of \u2019em pretty good size\u2014but you can\u2019t grow it outside in winter months. It\u2019s still the biggest cash crop in California. But even if you gave Clifford and those old boys a million dollars, that\u2019s how they\u2019re going to live.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cNot all local growers look like vagrants. A lot of \u2019em look like millionaires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened when you grabbed his arm like that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see? He was raising it like he was going to touch you. Familiarly.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cThanks. I guess. Why\u2019d you want me to see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo reasons\u2014so you\u2019d know what some of this country medicine is about. Some places where they\u2019re growing are booby-trapped, but not this one. You should never go out to one of those places alone. Not even if a baby\u2019s coming. You better hear me on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she said with a shudder. \u201cYou should tell someone, Doc. You should tell the sheriff or someone.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cFor all I know, the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s aware\u2014there are growers all over this part of the world. For the most part, they stay invisible\u2014it\u2019s not like they want to be found out. More to the point, I\u2019m in medicine, not law enforcement. I don\u2019t talk about the patients. I assume that\u2019s your ethic, as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey live in filth! They\u2019re hungry and probably sick! Their water is undoubtedly contaminated by the awful, dirty containers they keep it in. They\u2019re beating each other up and dying of drink and...whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make my day, either.\u201d</p><p>She found it devastating, the acceptance of such hopelessness. \u201cHow do you do it?\u201d</p><p>she asked him, her voice quiet.</p><p>\u201cI just do the best I can,\u201d he said. \u201cI help where I can. That\u2019s all anyone can do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThis really isn\u2019t for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI can handle stuff like this when it comes into the hospital, but I\u2019m no country practitioner. It\u2019s like the Peace Corps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are bright spots in my doctoring, too,\u201d he said. \u201cJust happens that isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p> <p>She was completely down in the dumps when she went back to the grill to collect the baby. \u201cNot pretty out there, is it?\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cHorrid. Have you ever been out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stumbled across them a couple years ago when I was hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want to tell anyone?\u201d she asked. \u201cLike the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t against the law to be a bum,\u201d he said with a shrug. So, she thought\u2014he didn\u2019t know about the semi-trailer. Doc had said it showed up not long ago. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine living like that. Can I use your bathroom? I want to wash up before I touch the baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight back off the kitchen,\u201d he said.</p><p>When she got back she picked up Chloe and held her close, breathing in the clean, powdery scent.</p><p>\u201cFortunately, you don\u2019t have to live like they do,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNeither do they. Someone should do an intervention out there, get them some help. Food and clean water, anyway.\u201d</p><p>He picked up the baby bed to carry it across the street for her. \u201cI think they\u2019ve killed too many brain cells for that to work,\u201d he said. \u201cConcentrate on the good you can do and don\u2019t gnaw on the hopeless cases. It\u2019ll just make you sad.\u201d</p><p>By early evening, Mel was coming around. She took her dinner at the bar, laughed with Jack and even Preacher cracked the occasional smile. Finally, she put her small hand over Jack\u2019s and said, \u201cI apologize for earlier, Jack. I never even thanked you for watching the baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were kind of upset,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I surprised myself. It\u2019s not as though I haven\u2019t seen plenty of bums and street people. They were frequent clientele at the hospital. I didn\u2019t realize before today that in the city we\u2019d clean \u2019em up, straighten \u2019em out and hand \u2019em off to some agency or another. In the back of my mind I probably always knew they\u2019d be back picking out of trash cans before long, but I didn\u2019t have to see it. This was very different. They\u2019re not going anywhere and they\u2019re not getting any help. It\u2019s been down to Doc. Alone. Takes a lot of courage to do what Doc does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does more than a lot of people would do,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThis is rough country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNot a lot of resources out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do pretty well with what we\u2019ve got. But you have to remember, the old boys in that little camp don\u2019t seem to want resources so much as to be left alone,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that\u2019s hard to stomach, but most of this area is the opposite\u2014thriving and healthy. Did that trip out into the woods make your desire to get out of here even more desperate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure opened my eyes. I thought small-town medicine would be peaceful and sweet. I never thought it had that other side\u2014as hopeless as some of our worst inner city problems.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t know that it is,\u201d he argued. \u201cThe sweet and peaceful will far outnumber the hopeless. I swear on it. You\u2019re welcome to see for yourself and call me a liar. But you\u2019d have to hang around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a commitment to stay till the baby is placed,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t promise more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo promises necessary. Just pointing out the options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut thank you, for taking care of the baby for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good baby,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mind at all.\u201d</p><p>After she\u2019d gone back to Doc\u2019s, Jack said to Preacher, \u201cYou okay here? I\u2019m thinking about a beer.\u201d</p><p>Preacher\u2019s bushy black brows shot up in surprise, but he didn\u2019t say it. Didn\u2019t say,</p><p>\u201cAnother beer? So soon?\u201d He finally said, \u201cI\u2019m okay here.\u201d</p><p>Jack knew that if he didn\u2019t say anything at all to Charmaine for a few weeks, she wouldn\u2019t know there was anything to be said. He also knew that despite the fact Mel had captured his thoughts, it didn\u2019t mean anything would ever happen, didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d make it even another week in Virgin River. That wasn\u2019t really the point. The issue was that it was wrong to go to Charmaine at all, ever, if he wasn\u2019t into Charmaine. It was a point of honor with him. Even though he never thought in terms of commitment, he certainly didn\u2019t think in terms of using someone. Then there was another matter. A fear that he\u2019d be having sex with Charmaine and behind his closed eyes, see another face. That couldn\u2019t happen. That would insult both women.</p><p>When she saw him walk into her tavern, her first reaction was one of pleased surprise and she smiled at him. Then she immediately realized how unprecedented this visit was and her smile vanished.</p><p>\u201cBeer?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cTalk?\u201d he answered. \u201cCan Butch cover for you for ten minutes?\u201d</p><p>She actually took a step back. She knew what was coming and sadness seeped into her brown eyes. Her face actually fell. \u201cIs that all it\u2019s going to take?\u201d she asked. \u201cTen minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. There isn\u2019t too much to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone else,\u201d she said at once.</p><p>\u201cNo. There isn\u2019t. Let\u2019s take a table.\u201d He looked over his shoulder. \u201cThat one over there. Ask Butch.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and turned from him. While she spoke to Butch, Jack moved to the table. Butch took the bar and Charmaine joined Jack. He reached across and took her hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been a wonderful friend to me, Charmaine. I never for one second took that for granted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mind is on other things,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t be coming to Clear River for a beer anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere can only be one thing,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I know you. And you have needs.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d thought about this long and hard on the way over, and it wasn\u2019t in his mind to lie to her. But there wasn\u2019t anyone else. Mel wasn\u2019t someone else\u2014and might never be. Just because she\u2019d taken over his consciousness didn\u2019t mean it would ever materialize into something more. She might stick to her word and leave Virgin River at the first opportunity, and even if she didn\u2019t, you don\u2019t show your hand this early in the game. His reason for breaking this off wasn\u2019t just about having Mel, but about not misleading Charmaine. She was a good woman; she had been good to him. She didn\u2019t deserve to be strung along while he waited to see what the other woman was going to do.</p><p>The cabin in Virgin River might be ready, but Mel sure wasn\u2019t. The baby at Doc\u2019s was keeping her in town for now, but it was impractical to think of her caring for Chloe out at the cabin\u2014there was only the one plexiglass incubator, no car seat for traveling back and forth, no phone. Of course, it was no punishment to have her living right across the street. But he wanted her in the cabin he\u2019d renovated, he wanted that real bad.</p><p>Charmaine was so right\u2014he had needs. But somehow when he looked at this young Mel, he knew it would never be like this\u2014an arrangement for sex every couple of weeks. Jack had absolutely no idea what it might become, but he already knew it was going to be more than that. He had a very long history of not getting hooked up, so this disturbed him. The chances were real good he was casting adrift in a sea of sheer loneliness. Because Mel had complications. He had no idea what they were, but that occasional sadness in her eyes came out of the past, something she was trying to get over.</p><p>But he wanted her. He wanted all of her; he wanted everything with her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI have needs. And right now I think what I need is completely different from what I\u2019ve needed in the past. I could easily keep coming here, Charmaine. I sure don\u2019t suffer, you\u2019re awful good to me. But the past two years when I\u2019ve been here, I\u2019ve been here completely. It shouldn\u2019t be any other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time was different,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew something was wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s really the first time my head wasn\u2019t connected to my body. You deserve better than that.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her chin and gave her hair a toss. \u201cWhat if I said I didn\u2019t care?\u201d</p><p>God, he felt so bad doing this. \u201cI do,\u201d was all he could say. She got teary. \u201cOkay, then,\u201d she said bravely. \u201cOkay, then.\u201d</p><p>When he left he knew it was going to be a while before he felt all right about what he\u2019d just done. That business about playing it fast and loose, about having no ties or commitments, that wasn\u2019t really how it was. All that no commitment bullshit meant was that you didn\u2019t talk about it, you never took it to the next level. He had had a contract of sorts with Charmaine, even if it wasn\u2019t a formal one, a legal one, even if it was pretty casual in the give-and-take department. She had stuck to the contract; he had just broken it. And let her down.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>I n the mornings, after the baby had that first really early feeding and was settled back to sleep, Mel liked to take her coffee out to Doc\u2019s front porch and sit on the steps. She found she enjoyed watching this little town wake up. First the sun would create a kind of golden path through the tall pine trees onto the street, slowly lighting it. The sound of doors opening and closing could be heard. A Ford truck drove slowly from the east to the west down the street, tossing out papers\u2014the Humboldt News. She liked getting the paper early\u2014though it was hardly akin to the L.A. Times. Soon the kids started to emerge. The bus picked them up at the far west end of the main street. Those in town would walk or ride their bikes down the street and gather there, chaining their bikes to trees in someone\u2019s front yard. That would never happen in the city\u2014someone just allowing their yard to be used as a bike lot while the kids were in school. She saw Liz come out of Connie\u2019s house right next to the store; Liz sashayed across the street, book bag slung over one shoulder, fanny swaying seductively. Boy howdy, Mel was thinking. That girl\u2019s advertising like mad. Cars and trucks began to drop off the more rural kids. It was not yet seven\u2014a long day for these country kids\u2014driven to the bus stop, ride the bus for who knows how long since there was no school in Virgin River, then back to town, back to the farm or ranch. The kids who gathered there, probably thirty, ranged in age from five to seventeen and the mothers of the younger ones stood around chatting while they waited for the bus. Some of them held their coffee cups and laughed together like old, old friends.</p><p>Then it would come, the bus, driven by a big happy woman who got off, said hello to the parents, herding each one of the kids on board.</p><p>Jack came out of the bar, fishing rod in one hand, tackle box in the other. He put his gear in the back of his truck and lifted a hand to her. She waved back. Out to the river for some fishing. Not long after, Preacher was sweeping off the front porch. When he looked up, he lifted a hand, as well.</p><p>What had she said about this little town? That it didn\u2019t resemble the pictures she\u2019d seen? In the early morning the town was lovely. Rather than looking old and tired, the homes looked sweet and uncomplicated. They were unfussy clapboards in a variety of colors\u2014blue, light green, beige with brown trim. Connie and Ron\u2019s house, right next to the corner store, was the same yellow with white trim as their store. Only one house on the street had been painted recently, a white house with dark green shutters and trim. She saw Rick come out of that house, sprint across the porch, jump down to the street and into his little white truck. It was a safe-looking street. Friendly homes. No one walked out of their homes to see another person and fail to greet, wave, stop and talk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>A woman came out from behind the boarded-up church down the street and seemed to be walking unevenly toward her. As she neared, Mel stood up. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, holding her coffee cup in both hands.</p><p>\u201cYou the nurse?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNurse practitioner and midwife, yes. Can I help you with something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI heard about you is all.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes were drawn down sleepily, as though she had trouble staying awake, with dark circles under them. She was a large woman, maybe five-ten, and rather plain, her greasy hair pulled back. It was possible she was sick. Mel stuck out a hand. \u201cMel Monroe,\u201d she said.</p><p>The woman hesitated a minute before accepting a handshake. She wiped her palm down her pant leg first, then reached out. Her grip was strong and clumsy, her nails dirty. \u201cCheryl,\u201d she said in response. \u201cCreighton.\u201d She pulled her hand back and put both her hands in the pockets of baggy pants. Men\u2019s pants, it looked like. Mel stopped herself before saying, Ahhh. That would be the Cheryl who was supposed to clean the cabin; the Cheryl Hope suspected was drinking again. Which would explain her sallow complexion and weary eyes, not to mention all the little broken blood vessels in her cheeks. \u201cSure I can\u2019t do anything for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They say you\u2019re leaving right away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo they now,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cWell, I have a few things I made a commitment to see through first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat baby,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mel tipped her head to one side. \u201cHardly anything goes unnoticed around here. Do you know anything about the baby, or her mother? I\u2019d like to find the woman w\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could go sooner? Because if you want to go\u2014I could take care of the baby...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have an interest in the baby?\u201d she asked. \u201cMay I ask why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just mean to help. I like to help out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI really don\u2019t need much help\u2014but I sure would like to find the baby\u2019s mother. She could be sick, giving birth alone like that.\u201d</p><p>Mel chanced a glance toward the bar and noticed that Preacher had stopped sweeping and watched. At that same moment, Doc came out of the house. \u201cCheryl,\u201d Doc said.</p><p>\u201cHey, Doc. Just telling the nurse here\u2014I could help out with that baby. Watch her for you and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you want to do that, Cheryl?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cJack told me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. We\u2019ll sure keep you in mind,\u201d Doc said.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Kay,\u201d she said with another shrug. She looked at Mel. \u201cNice meetin\u2019 you. Explains a lot, now I see you.\u201d And she turned and walked back the way she\u2019d come. Mel looked up at Doc and found him frowning. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cSeems like she wanted to see what you look like. She tends to follow Jack around like a lovesick puppy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t serve her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t,\u201d Doc said. \u201cJack\u2019s a generous guy, but not a foolish one. Giving Cheryl booze would be like throwing kerosene on a fire. Besides, she can\u2019t afford Jack\u2019s place. I think she gets some of that rotgut they keep out in the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t somebody help her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe look to you like she wants help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone tried? Has Jack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack can\u2019t do anything for her,\u201d Doc said. \u201cThat would put an awful lot of useless ideas in her head.\u201d</p><p>He turned around and went back into the house. Mel followed him and said, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible she gave birth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything\u2019s possible. But I doubt it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we checked her? It would be obvious.\u201d</p><p>Doc looked down at her and lifted one snowy brow. \u201cThink I should call the sheriff?</p><p>Get a warrant?\u201d And he walked off toward the kitchen.</p><p>What an odd little town, Mel found herself thinking.</p><p>While the baby napped, Mel took a break and wandered down to the store. Connie poked her head out of the back and said, \u201cHey, Mel. Can I get you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just thought I\u2019d look at your magazines, Connie. I\u2019m bored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself. We\u2019re watching our soap, if you want to come back here with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said, going to the very small book rack. There were a few paperbacks and five magazines. Guns, trucks, fishing, hunting and Playboy. She picked up a paperback novel and the Playboy and went to the back where she\u2019d seen Connie. A parted curtain hung in the doorway to the back room. Inside, Connie and Joy sat in old canvas lawn chairs in front of the small desk, coffee cups in hand, their eyes focused on a small TV that sat on a shelf. The women were complete physical opposites\u2014Connie being small and trim with short hair dyed fire-engine-red, and Joy must be easily five-nine and two-fifty, very plain with her long, graying hair pulled back into a ponytail, her face round and cheerful. They were an odd pair and it was said they\u2019d been best friends since they were kids. \u201cCome on back,\u201d Joy said. \u201cHelp yourself to coffee if you want.\u201d</p><p>On the television a very pretty woman looked into the eyes of a very handsome man and said, \u201cBrent, I never loved anyone but you! Ever!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she is such a liar!\u201d Connie said.</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s not\u2014she didn\u2019t love any of them. She just screwed \u2019em all,\u201d Joy said. On the TV: \u201cBelinda, the bab\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrent, the baby is yours!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby is Donovan\u2019s,\u201d Joy told the TV.</p><p>Mel leaned a hip against the desk. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiverside Falls,\u201d Connie said. \u201cBrent and the slut Belinda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is what Lizzie is going to be doing if Connie can\u2019t get her out of those slutty clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a plan,\u201d Connie said. \u201cAs she grows out of her clothes and I replace them, we\u2019re going to get a more conservative wardrobe.\u201d</p><p>Joy laughed loudly. \u201cConnie, it looks like she already grew out of them!\u201d</p><p>The camera pulled back and Mel saw that the couple on screen were in bed together, their naked bodies barely concealed by a sheet. \u201cWhew,\u201d she said. \u201cSoaps have come a long way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ever watch any soaps, honey?\u201d Connie asked.</p><p>\u201cNot since college. We watched General Hospital.\u201d Mel put down her magazine and book on the desk and helped herself to a cup of coffee. \u201cWe used to get our patients to keep an eye on it for us. I had one long-term care patient\u2014an old guy\u2014and I used to give him his bath at two every afternoon and we\u2019d watch it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is only one man left on this show that Belinda hasn\u2019t done\u2014and he\u2019s seventy. The patriarch.\u201d Connie sighed. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to bring in some new talent for Belinda.\u201d</p><p>Back on TV, Belinda bit at Brent\u2019s lip, then his chin, then slipped lower in the bed and disappeared under the sheet. All three women in the back room leaned toward the TV. The lump in the sheet that was Belinda\u2019s head went lower and momentarily Brent threw back his head and let a delicious moan escape.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>Connie fanned her face.</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s her secret weapon,\u201d Joy said. And the program cut to commercial. Connie and Joy looked at each other, giggled and got up out of their chairs. \u201cWell, not much has changed since yesterday. That baby\u2019s gonna be in college before it gets out who the daddy is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not even sure it is Donovan\u2019s. She was with Carter, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a long time ago\u2014it couldn\u2019t be his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you two been watching this soap?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, fifteen years?\u201d Connie answered by way of a question.</p><p>\u201cAt least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou find a magazine, honey?\u201d</p><p>Mel made a face and held up the Playboy.</p><p>\u201cMy, my,\u201d Connie said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not too interested in trucks, fish, guns or game,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever get any others in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you tell me what you want, I\u2019ll have Ron pick \u2019em up on his next run. We only carry what we sell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope I haven\u2019t just snatched up some poor guy\u2019s Playboy that he\u2019s looking forward to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry about it,\u201d Connie said. \u201cHey, there\u2019s a little potluck at the bar tonight for Joy\u2019s birthday. Why don\u2019t you come on over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, I don\u2019t have a present!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t do presents, honey,\u201d Joy said. \u201cJust come and party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, happy birthday anyway, Joy. I\u2019ll check with Doc,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat time? If I can come, should I bring something for the potluck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get over there about six, and no, don\u2019t you worry about bringing anything. I don\u2019t guess you do any cooking at Doc\u2019s and we have the food covered. Nothing new on that baby, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a peep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamnedest thing,\u201d Joy said. \u201cBet whoever\u2019s it is came from another one of the towns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to think that, too,\u201d Mel said. She pulled some bills out of her pocket to pay for her stuff. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see you later, then.\u201d</p><p>On her way back to Doc\u2019s she passed the bar. Jack was sitting on the porch with his feet up on the rail. She wandered over. Sitting beside him was a fishing tackle box full of beautiful feathery flies. Small pliers, scissors and a razor blade were sticking out of the tackle box, as well as little plastic envelopes that contained colorful feathers, silver hooks and other paraphernalia.</p><p>\u201cBreak time?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been on break all day, except for a little diaper changing and feeding. The baby\u2019s asleep, there aren\u2019t any patients and Doc is afraid to play gin with me. It turns out I can beat his socks off.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed. He leaned forward and peered at the book and magazine. He looked at her face and raised an eyebrow. \u201cLittle light reading?\u201d he asked. She lifted the magazine. \u201cIt was either this or guns, trucks, hunting or fishing. You want to borrow it when I\u2019m through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like naked women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love naked women\u2014I just don\u2019t feel like looking at pictures of them. It seems like you\u2019d get enough of that in your line of work,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cLike I said, the choices were pretty limited. I haven\u2019t seen one of these in years, but when I was in college my roommates and I used to laugh ourselves stupid at the advice column. And they used to have some interesting stories. Does Playboy still run fiction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have absolutely no idea, Melinda,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I\u2019ve noticed about this town? Everyone has a satellite dish and at least one gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of items that seem to be necessary. No cable TV out here. You shoot?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI hate guns,\u201d she said with a shudder. \u201cTry to imagine the number of gunshot deaths in a trauma center in L.A.\u201d She shivered again. He has no idea, she thought.</p><p>\u201cThe guns around here aren\u2019t the kind people use on each other. Hardly a handgun in the town, although I have a couple, just because I\u2019ve had them for a long time. This is rifle and shotgun country\u2014used for hunting, euthanizing a sick or wounded animal, protection from wildlife. I could teach you to shoot, so you\u2019d be more comfortable with guns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. I hate to even be around them. All these guns I see in the gun racks in the trucks\u2014are they loaded?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cYou bet. You don\u2019t take a minute to load your rifle if a bear is charging you. Bear fish in the same rivers we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhew, fishing just took on a whole new meaning. Who shot all the animals on the walls in the bar?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cPreacher got the buck. I caught the fish and shot the bear.\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head. \u201cHow can you get any satisfaction out of killing innocent animals?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe buck and fish were innocent,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut that bear wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t want to shoot her, but I was working on the bar and she was poking around right back there, maybe looking for trash. Bear are scavengers\u2014they\u2019ll eat anything. It was a real dry summer. Her cub wandered too close to me and riled her up. Pissed her off. She must have gotten the idea I was going to interfere with the cub. So...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw. What happened to the cub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI locked him in the bar until Fish and Game could come out for him. They relocated him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. For her. She was just being a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to shoot that bear,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even hunt bear. I carry repellent\u2014</p><p>sort of a pepper spray. That day the repellent was in the truck, but the rifle was handy. I wouldn\u2019t have shot her, but it kind of got down to her or me.\u201d He grinned at her.</p><p>\u201cCity girl,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m just a city girl. With no dead animals on my walls. Think I\u2019ll keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>Friday night, big night in Virgin River. There were more than the usual number of cars parked around the bar, though the people Mel knew best would have walked over. Mel had said to Doc, \u201cThere\u2019s a potluck for Joy\u2019s birthday at Jack\u2019s tonight. I assume you\u2019re going over. Maybe later, if you could spell me for a half hour, I can just drop in and wish her a happy birthday.\u201d</p> <p>Doc scoffed at that idea. All he wanted was to go collect his one whiskey of the day, have a bite to eat and turn in. So Mel fed and settled the baby while he was across the street. She fluffed her hair and put on a little lipstick, ready for what she expected to be a fairly dull evening, but an evening with a few friendly faces nonetheless. It was seven-thirty before Chloe slept and she was able to leave. \u201cI won\u2019t be long,\u201d she told Doc.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cDance till dawn for all I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you call me if you need me?\u201d she asked Doc.</p><p>\u201cHardly ever have a party in this town,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should take advantage of it. I know how to change and feed. Been doing it a lot longer than you.\u201d</p><p>When she walked in, she found the place nearly full of people. The jukebox, which was hardly ever playing, provided background music. Country. Jack and Preacher were behind the bar, Ricky was busy bussing tables. She looked around until she found Joy.</p><p>\u201cSorry to be showing up so late, Joy. The baby didn\u2019t really want to settle down tonight.\u201d She plucked her sweater away from herself and gave a little sniff. \u201cI think I might smell like cheese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fine\u2014and there\u2019s still plenty of food left so grab yourself a plate.\u201d</p><p>A few tables had been pushed together to line a wall and upon them, dish after casserole dish of delicious-looking food. Right in the center was a sheet cake practically covered with candles. After she\u2019d put some food on her plate, people started wandering over to say hello and chat. She greeted Fish Bristol, noted fisherman in these parts, and his wife Carrie. Harv, who was found in the bar almost every morning, was a lineman for the telephone company, but before getting out on the road he had his breakfast at Jack\u2019s. \u201cMy wife can\u2019t be bothered to get out of bed just to cook breakfast,\u201d he said with a laugh. She noticed that Liz was tucked away in the corner, looking miserably bored, her long, shapely legs crossed, her short skirt just barely covering her privates. Mel gave her a wave, coaxing a very small smile out of Liz. Mel was introduced to a sheep rancher and his wife, Buck and Lilly Anderson\u2014</p> <p>Buck, tall and skinny and balding and Lilly, short and round and rosy cheeked. \u201cAny news on that baby?\u201d Lilly asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIs she a good baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God, she\u2019s perfect. An angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no one\u2019s asked if they can take her? Adopt her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even heard from social services yet,\u201d Mel said. Connie brought a friend over to introduce. \u201cMel, this is Jo Fitch. She and her husband live on the end of the street\u2014the biggest house there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad to finally meet you,\u201d Jo said. \u201cNo one expected such a young, pretty girl. We\u2014\u201d</p><p>Before Jo could finish she was joined by a man who slipped an arm about Jo\u2019s waist and, while swirling a drink in his glass, boldly looked Mel up and down and said,</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well...so this is our little nurse? Ohhh, nurse, I\u2019m not feeling so good!\u201d</p><p>And then he treated himself to a great big laugh.</p><p>\u201cMy husband, Nick,\u201d Jo said. If Mel wasn\u2019t mistaken, she said it somewhat nervously.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do,\u201d Mel said politely, deciding that he\u2019d had a bit too much to drink. She turned to Connie and said, \u201cEverything is so delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, nurse Melinda\u2014how do you like our little town?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cPlease, just call me Mel,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s great. You\u2019re very lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d he said, looking her over again. \u201cWe really got lucky. Where do I sign up for an examination?\u201d And he laughed at himself some more.</p><p>It came back to her then\u2014Jo Ellen and that husband of hers. This was the guy. He\u2019d been slapped down by more than one woman, Hope had said. He couldn\u2019t possibly be more obvious. \u201cGosh, excuse me just a second, I\u2019ll be right back. I need something to drink.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arm and said, \u201cLet me\u2014\u201d</p><p>She shook him off firmly, smiling all the while. \u201cNo, no. You wait right here,\u201d and she scooted away as fast as she could. On her way to the bar she stopped to say hello to Doug and Sue Carpenter, frequent visitors at Jack\u2019s. She met the elder Fishburns\u2014</p><p>Polly\u2019s mother and father-in-law. When she got to the bar and hopped up on a stool in front of Jack, setting her plate down, she didn\u2019t have his attention right away. He was looking into the crowded room, frowning.</p><p>Finally he looked at her. \u201cCould I have a beer?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look too happy,\u201d she observed.</p><p>His expression relaxed. \u201cJust keeping an eye on things,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she nodded, taking a sip. \u201cHave you eaten this stuff? It\u2019s almost as good as Preacher\u2019s. These country women can cook!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why most of them are\u2014how should I put it? Robust?\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. Leaving her beer for a moment, she ate a little more off her plate.</p><p>\u201cYet another reason for me to get back to civilization.\u201d</p><p>She stayed there for a moment longer, then he was beside her again. Nick. \u201cI waited,\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Nick. Sorry\u2014but I have to mingle. I\u2019m new in town you know.\u201d And off the stool she leaped, beer in her hand, leaving the plate behind. As Nick made to follow, he found his wrist clamped down on the bar. Jack looked into his eyes darkly. \u201cYour wife is waiting for you over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe a sport, Jack,\u201d Nick said laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better behave yourself,\u201d Jack warned.</p><p>Nick laughed heartily. \u201cNow, Jack\u2014you can\u2019t have all the pretty girls to yourself. I mean, come on, man! All our wives are hot for you\u2014cut a guy some slack.\u201d And he made his escape.</p><p>Jack watched closely from behind the bar. He was able to serve drinks and draw drafts without taking his eyes off the room. Nick seemed to follow Mel around like a smitten puppy, sidling up as close as possible, but Mel was quick. She\u2019d go around to the far sides of tables to crouch to speak to people, get other men between her and Nick, slip across the room as if there was someone she just had to see, always leaving Nick in her dust. Preacher was behind the bar with him and at a point said, \u201cWant me to give him a little advice before he gets his nose broken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Jack said flatly. Jack was thinking that breaking his nose was going to feel very good. If Nick put one hand on her, he was going to come apart.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been to a good bar fight in years.\u201d</p><p>In keeping an eye on things, he saw Connie\u2019s young niece stand up and walk over to the buffet, stick her finger into the icing on the cake and then into her mouth, slowly, so slowly pulling her finger back out while glancing over her shoulder at Rick\u2014and his boy Ricky froze at one of the tables where he was picking up glasses. Jack saw him see her; saw Ricky almost tremble for a moment, mouth open slightly, eyes wide, taking her in\u2014those long legs, full breasts. Oh, boy, Jack thought. Someone lit the candles on the cake and everyone got up from their tables and came from the edges of the room to gather round, sing and watch Joy knock herself out trying to blow out fifty-three of them.</p><p>Mel stood at the rear of the crowd; Jack\u2019s eyes were back on her. Jack scowled blackly as Nick came up behind her. He couldn\u2019t see what was happening through the crowd, but he noted that a smile grew on Nick\u2019s face just as Mel\u2019s chin raised up, her eyes grew round and startled and she threw a panicked look in Jack\u2019s direction. Jack pushed himself off the bar and was making fast tracks to the other side when Mel reacted.</p><p>Mel felt a hand run over her bottom and inch between her legs. She was stunned for a moment, disbelieving. Then her instincts kicked in and shifted her beer to her other hand, threw an elbow back into his gut, brought that same elbow up under his chin, swept his legs out from under him with one booted foot, lifting him off his feet to send him crashing to the floor, flat on his back. She put her foot on his chest and glared into his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever try anything like that again!\u201d All this without spilling a drop of her beer.</p><p>Jack froze at the end of the bar. Whoa, he thought. Damn.</p><p>A second passed. Then Mel looked around the now silent room in some embarrassment. Everyone was shocked and staring. \u201cOh!\u201d she said, but her foot still held Nick on his back. Nick who, it seemed, couldn\u2019t draw a breath, just lay there, stunned. She removed her foot. \u201cOh...\u201d she said.</p><p>A laugh broke out of the crowd. Someone clapped. A woman yelped approvingly. Mel backed away somewhat sheepishly. She ended up at the bar, right in front of Jack. Right where she felt safest. Jack put a hand on her shoulder and glared in Nick\u2019s direction.</p><p>Mel felt awfully sorry for Jo Ellen. What\u2019s a woman from a town this size supposed to do with an obnoxious husband like that? Once Jo peeled him off the floor and took him home, the party became much more fun, and the jokes were fabulous. Several men asked her to arm wrestle and she had clearly become a hero to the women. The stories of Nick\u2019s antics were both shocking and entertaining. Once, when he was feeling invincible and couldn\u2019t resist a breast, he\u2019d been coldcocked by a woman. Up till tonight that was the most legendary put down he\u2019d suffered. He\u2019d collected a number of slaps, but by some miracle had not yet been beat to a pulp by an angry husband; he was apparently regarded as a pathetic joke. It seemed that when there was some kind of community or neighborhood party, like tonight, he\u2019d have a couple of pops and get frisky, take chances that, by the light of day, he managed to keep under control. His reputation was firmly established.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you keep inviting him,\u201d Mel observed to Connie.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just us here, kiddo. We\u2019re kind of stuck with each other.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cHe should be told that if he can\u2019t mind his manners, he won\u2019t be included anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem with that is it would leave Jo out\u2014and she\u2019s good people. I feel a whole lot sorrier for Jo than any of the women he pesters,\u201d Connie said. \u201cMakes her look like a damn fool. We can pretty much take care of ourselves.\u201d She patted Mel\u2019s arm. \u201cAnd you, girl\u2014I doubt he\u2019s going to give you any more trouble.\u201d</p> <p>At nine o\u2019clock the party abruptly ended. It was as though someone had rung a bell\u2014</p><p>all the women gathered up their dishes, men stacked up plates and picked up trash, goodbyes were being said and people were filing out the door. Mel was at the back of the group, following, when Jack called her. \u201cHold up,\u201d he said. So she went back and jumped up on the stool. He put a cup of coffee in front of her. \u201cDid I call you a city girl?\u201d he asked with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t even know I could still do that,\u201d she said, accepting the coffee.</p><p>\u201cMind if I ask how you learned that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a long time ago\u2014when I was in my last year of college. There had been some rapes around the campus and a bunch of us went to a self-defense instructor together. To tell you the truth, I was never sure that would work in a real situation. I mean, with an instructor, mats on the floor, everything rehearsed and knowing exactly what to expect\u2014that\u2019s one thing. But I wasn\u2019t sure I could react the same way if a real rapist jumped out from behind a parked car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow you know. He never saw it coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that worked to my advantage, too.\u201d She sipped her coffee.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see what he did,\u201d he said. \u201cI could tell by the stupid grin on his face and the shocked look on yours that something happened.\u201d</p><p>She put her cup on the bar. \u201cMajor butt grope,\u201d she said. And she noted that Jack\u2019s expression went instantly dark; mean, narrowed eyes, deep frown. \u201cWhew, easy buddy, it wasn\u2019t your butt. I saw you making a move\u2014what were you about to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay too much,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like seeing something like that in my bar. I was watching him all night. The second he saw you, it was a target lock-on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a giant nuisance, but I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019ll leave me alone now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was kind of funny the way the party just suddenly stopped like that. Did someone look at their watch or something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLivestock don\u2019t give days off,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNeither do babies,\u201d she said, getting off the stool.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, Jack. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>He came around the bar anyway. \u201cIndulge me. It\u2019s been an interesting night.\u201d He took her arm, telling himself he was just being gentlemanly but, in fact, if he saw the chance, he was going to get his lips on hers. He\u2019d been wanting to kiss her for days. They walked across the porch and down the steps, out into the street. There were no streetlights, but the moon was high and full and cast a soft glow over the town. There was a light on in the upstairs bedroom at Doc\u2019s. Jack stopped right in the middle of the street. \u201cLook, Mel. Look at that sky. You can\u2019t find that anywhere else on earth. All those stars, that moon\u2014the clear black sky. That belongs to us.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at the most gorgeous sky imaginable, with more stars than she thought existed. He stepped behind her and with his hands on both of her upper arms, he gently squeezed.</p><p>\u201cYou just can\u2019t see this in the city. In any city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is beautiful,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI admit, this is beautiful country.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s majestic. One of these days, before you pack it in and run for your life, I\u2019d like to show you some things. The redwoods, the rivers, the coast. It\u2019s almost time for whale watching.\u201d She leaned back against him and couldn\u2019t deny it felt pretty good to be shored up by Jack. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened tonight.\u201d He leaned down and inhaled the scent of her hair. \u201cI was really impressed with how well you handled it\u2014</p><p>but I\u2019m sorry he...I hate that he touched you like that. I thought I had an eye on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo quick for me. Too quick for you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He turned her around and looked into her eyes. He thought he saw an invitation there in her upturned face and he lowered his.</p><p>She put a hand on his chest. \u201cI have to go in now,\u201d she said, a little breathless. He straightened.</p><p>\u201cWe both know I couldn\u2019t throw you,\u201d she said, smiling weakly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never have to,\u201d he said. But he still held her arms, so reluctant to let go.</p><p>\u201cGood night, Jack. And thanks for everything. Despite Nick\u2014I had a good time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d he said. And he let go.</p><p>She turned, and with her head down, went the rest of the way alone. He stood in the street until she was inside, then headed back to the bar. On his way, he saw Ricky\u2019s truck parked right in front of Connie\u2019s house. Well, damn\u2014the boy sure didn\u2019t waste any time. Ricky didn\u2019t have a mom or dad and his grandmother wasn\u2019t well. Jack had been looking out for him for a long time and he knew this day would come eventually\u2014they\u2019d have to have THE talk. But not tonight. Tonight Jack would have that talk with himself.</p><p>Preacher had the chairs upside down on the tables and was sweeping up. Jack walked right by him at a good clip. \u201cWhere you going in such a hurry?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>\u201cShower,\u201d he said miserably.</p><p>It was because Connie and Ron liked Ricky so much that they had no problem with him staying out in front of the house talking with Liz for a few minutes. They trusted him, he knew this. But maybe they shouldn\u2019t because if they knew what one look at Liz had done to him, they\u2019d lock her up.</p><p>She leaned against the porch, crossed her legs in front of her, pulled a cigarette out of her purse and lit it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing that for?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cGot a problem with it?\u201d she said, blowing out smoke.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMakes your mouth taste like shit,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to want to kiss you if you smoke.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cSomeone wants to kiss me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He took the cigarette out of her hand and tossed it. Then he grabbed her around the waist and brought her onto his lips. Yeah, he thought. Makes your mouth taste bad, but not bad enough.</p><p>She curved right to him and of course it happened to him. Happened all the time these days. When she opened her mouth and pressed harder against him, it happened even more. Holy God, he was dying. He could feel her full, hard breasts against his chest and right now all he wanted was to palm one. Against her lips he said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll cut your life short.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he said. \u201cReally beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys aren\u2019t beautiful. You want a ride to school Monday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPick you up at seven. What class are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreshman,\u201d she said.</p><p>It stopped happening to him real fast. \u201cFour...fourteen?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cYeah. And you\u2019re...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...A junior. Sixteen.\u201d He backed away a little. \u201cDamn. Holy God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I just lose my ride?\u201d she asked, tugging her sweater down a little bit, which only made her boobs pop out more.</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cNah. What the heck, huh? See you Monday morning.\u201d He started to walk away, then turned back abruptly and decided on another kiss. Deep and strong. Long. And then another, still longer. Maybe deeper. She sure didn\u2019t feel fourteen.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>O ne morning, Doc left the house early, before breakfast, to make a call. He hadn\u2019t been gone long when Lilly Anderson came to the office to see Mel. Lilly was in the same general age group with Connie and Joy and most of the other women Mel had met\u2014late forties to early fifties. She was pleasantly round with a soft, kind face and lots of short, curly brown hair strung with gray. She wore no makeup and her skin was perfect, blemish-free ivory with pink cheeks and a sweet dimpled smile. The moment Mel met her at the potluck, she\u2019d sensed a safe, nurturing way about her. Mel instantly liked her, trusted her. \u201cYou still have that little one, that baby?\u201d Lilly asked.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised no one has come forward, wanting to take her in, adopt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised by that, too,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cPerfect healthy little baby,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat about all those people who want to adopt healthy babies? Where are they?\u201d</p><p>Mel shrugged. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s just a matter of social services getting their ducks in a row\u2014I understand they\u2019re busy and small towns like this get put on the back burner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about her. I thought, well, maybe I could help out,\u201d Lilly said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice of you,\u201d Mel said. \u201cDo you live nearby? Because sometimes it\u2019s nice for me and Doc to get a break for a few hours. Especially if we have patients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ranchers\u2014I\u2019m on the other side of the river, but it\u2019s not so far. Thing is, I already raised six youngsters\u2014had my first at only nineteen and my baby is eighteen now and already married. But I have room at the house, what with the kids gone off on their own. I could take in the baby until something permanent is arranged for her. I even have those old baby things stored in the barn. Maybe I could be a foster parent. Buck, my husband, he says it would be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very generous, Lilly, but I\u2019m afraid we couldn\u2019t pay you anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t need pay,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a neighborly thing. We help out when we can. And I do love babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you something\u2014have you any idea who might\u2019ve had this baby?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and looked terribly pained. \u201cYou have to ask yourself, what kind of woman would give up her baby? Maybe some young girl in trouble, no one to help her. I raised three daughters and by the grace of God, none had to pass that way. I have seven grandchildren already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of starting early,\u201d Mel said. \u201cYour grandchildren come along while you\u2019re still young enough to enjoy them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m blessed,\u201d she said. \u201cI know this. I can only imagine that whoever left her must have been desperate, so desperate.\u201d Mel thought Lilly might have even briefly had tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll take your offer to Doc and see what he says. You\u2019re sure? Because I can give you some formula and diapers, and that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. And please tell Doc I\u2019d be more than happy to do it.\u201d</p><p>When Doc returned an hour later, Mel told him the story. His white eyebrows shot up in surprise and he rubbed a hand over his head. \u201cLilly Anderson?\u201d he asked. He seemed to be considering this idea with some consternation.</p><p>\u201cDoes something about that worry you, because we can make do here a while longer...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorry me? No.\u201d He collected himself. \u201cSurprises me, is all.\u201d And he shuffled off to his office.</p><p>She followed him. \u201cWell? You didn\u2019t have an answer.\u201d</p><p>He turned back toward her. \u201cCan\u2019t think of a better place for that infant than Lilly\u2019s,\u201d</p><p>he said. \u201cLilly and Buck are good people. And they know what to do with a baby, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need time to think about this?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hoping a family would turn up.\u201d He peered at her over his glasses. \u201cSeems like maybe you need some time to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, somewhat tremulously. \u201cIf you\u2019re okay, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThink it over, just the same. I\u2019ll walk across the street and see if anyone\u2019s willing to play cribbage. Then, if you\u2019re of a mind, we\u2019ll take her out to the Anderson ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said. But she said it very quietly.</p><p>Jack was painfully, embarrassingly aware that Mel had only been in town three weeks, and he could think of little else. Fact was, from the moment he looked at her in the dim light of the bar that first night, he wanted to sit right down at that table with her and get to know her.</p><p>He saw her every day, and given their meals together and long conversations, he knew himself to be her closest friend at the moment. And yet there was much about herself she was concealing. She was open about having lost her parents young, her close relationship with her sister and sister\u2019s family, her nursing career, the crazy and chaotic life at the hospital, but it was as though there was a block of time missing. Him, Jack thought. The one who devastated her and left her hurt and lonely. Jack would drive him away, given half a chance.</p><p>He wished he knew what it was that had hooked him so quickly, so thoroughly. It wasn\u2019t just her beauty, though that was evident. True, there weren\u2019t any pretty, single women around town, but he hadn\u2019t been lonely. And Mel hadn\u2019t been the only sexy woman he\u2019d laid eyes on in the past few years. He was hardly a hermit; he\u2019d been to lots of the other towns, the coastal towns, to night spots. There\u2019d been Clear River. But Mel had some aura that had him all worked up. That tight little body, full breasts, compact fanny, rosy lips, not to mention some real sexy brains\u2014it was all he could do to keep from breathing heavy in her presence. When she had those moments when whatever plagued her was forgotten, and she smiled or laughed, her whole face brightened up. Her blue eyes danced. He\u2019d already dreamed of her; felt her hands all over his body, felt her beneath him, felt himself inside of her, heard her soft moans of pleasure and bam! He awoke to find himself as alone as ever, bathed in sweat. Jack was already turned on before Mel dropped Nick on his ass, but if he hadn\u2019t been, that sure would have sealed the deal. She was a dynamo. Gorgeous, feminine little thing with one helluva punch. Whoa. Damn.</p> <p>The vulnerability in her eyes warned him he\u2019d better be very, very careful. One wrong move and she\u2019d jump in that little BMW and shake the dust of Virgin River off the soles of her shoes, the town\u2019s medical needs notwithstanding. He reminded himself constantly that this was one reason he hadn\u2019t sprung the cabin on her yet. Walking away from her last week after Joy\u2019s party had been one of the hardest things he\u2019d ever done. He had wanted nothing so much as to crush her to him and say, it\u2019s going to be all right\u2014I can make it all right, all good. Give me a chance. Doc and Preacher sat at a table in the bar, playing cribbage. Jack put a slice of Preacher\u2019s apple pie on a plate, covered it with Saran wrap and left the bar to walk across the street. No cars or trucks at Doc\u2019s except Doc\u2019s truck and that little BMW</p><p>parked on the side. All clear, he thought, his pulse picking up. He opened the front door and looked around; no one. He thought to go tap on the office door, but a sound from the kitchen led him there instead.</p><p>The baby in her little Plexiglas bed on wheels sat near the warm stove and Mel was at the table, her head down, resting on her folded arms. And she sobbed. He rushed to her; he put the pie on the table and was down on one knee at the side of her chair, all in one movement. \u201cMel,\u201d he said.</p><p>She lifted her head, her cheeks chafed and pink. \u201cDammit,\u201d she said through her tears.</p><p>\u201cYou caught me.\u201d</p><p>His hand was on her back. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked gently. Now, he thought. Now she\u2019ll tell me about it, let me help her through it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve found a home for the baby. Someone came in and offered to take her and Doc endorses it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLilly Anderson,\u201d she said, large tears spilling over. \u201cOh, Jack. I let it happen. I got attached.\u201d And she leaned against his shoulder and wept.</p><p>Jack forgot everything. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said, pulling her out of the chair. He traded places with her and pulled her down on his lap. She encircled his neck with her arms, her face buried in his shoulder, crying, and he gently stroked her back. His lips were on her soft hair. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let it happen,\u201d she said into his shirt. \u201cStupid. I knew better. I even named her. What was I thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave her affection,\u201d he said. \u201cYou were so good to her. I\u2019m sorry it hurts.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t sorry, because he had his arms around her and it felt as he knew it would, her little body, warm and solid, against his. She was light as a feather on his lap, her arms around his neck like ribbons, and the sweet, fragrant smell of her hair coiled around his brain and tightened, addling his thoughts.</p><p>She lifted her head and looked into his eyes. \u201cI thought about taking her,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRunning away with her. That\u2019s how crazy I am. Jack, you should know\u2014I\u2019m totally nuts.\u201d</p> <p>He wiped the tears from her cheeks. \u201cIf you want her, Mel, you can try to adopt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Andersons,\u201d she said. \u201cDoc says they\u2019re good people. A good family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are. Salt of the earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that would be better for her than a single mother who works all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cShe needs a real bed, not this incubator. A real family, not a midwife and an old doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are lots of different kinds of families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know what\u2019s best.\u201d Then the tears began to flow again. \u201cIt\u2019s just so hard.\u201d And she laid her head back on his shoulder. His arms tightened around her and hers tightened around his neck. He closed his eyes and just rested his cheek against her hair.</p><p>Feeling these strong arms around her, Mel let herself sink into a good, heartfelt cry. She was fully aware of him, but what really mattered to her at the moment was that for the first time in almost a year of crying, she wasn\u2019t alone. Someone was holding her and she felt protected. There was the comfort of strength and warmth, and she welcomed it. His chambray shirt was soft against her cheek and his thighs hard beneath her. He had a wonderful scent of cologne and the outdoors and she felt safe with him. His hand stroked her back and she was aware that he softly kissed her hair. He rocked her gently as she continued to dampen his shirt. Minutes passed and her weeping slowed to a sniffle, then a murmur. She lifted her head and looked at him, though she said nothing. His brain went numb. He touched her lips softly with his, gently, tentatively. Her eyes closed as she allowed this and his arms tightened around her as he pressed more firmly against her lips. Hers opened and his breath caught as he opened his own and felt her small tongue dart into his mouth. His world reeled and he was lost in a kiss that deepened, that moved him, that shook him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she whispered against his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t get mixed up with me, Jack.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, holding her against him as though he would never let her go.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me,\u201d he said against her lips.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I have nothing to give. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t asked you for a thing,\u201d he said. But in his mind he was saying, you\u2019re mistaken. You are giving, and taking\u2014and it feels damn good. All Mel could think, in the abstract, was that her body for once wasn\u2019t hollow and so empty she ached. She drank it in, the feeling of being connected to something. To someone. Anchored. So wonderful to have that human contact again. In her soul she had forgotten how, but her body remembered. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Jack,\u201d she said against his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be hurt. Because I can\u2019t love anyone.\u201d</p><p>All he said was, \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him again. Deeply. Passionately. For a long minute; two minutes, moving under his mouth with heat.</p><p>And the baby fussed.</p><p>She pulled away from him. \u201cOh, man, why\u2019d I do that?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a mistake.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMistake? Nah. We\u2019re friends,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re close. You needed some comfort and\u2014and here I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat just can\u2019t happen,\u201d she said, sounding a little desperate. He took charge, feeling his own sense of desperation. \u201cMel, stop it. You were crying. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was kissing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so were you!\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cYou are so hard on yourself sometimes. It\u2019s okay to feel something that doesn\u2019t hurt once in a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me that won\u2019t happen again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t if you don\u2019t want it to. But let me tell you something\u2014if you do want it to, I\u2019m going to let you. You know why? Because I like kissing. And I don\u2019t beat myself up about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing that,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to be stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re punishing yourself. I can\u2019t figure out why. But,\u201d he said, lifting her off his lap and putting her on her feet. \u201cYou get to call the shots. Personally, I think you secretly like me. Trust me. And I think for a minute there, you also liked kissing me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cI could tell. I\u2019m so smart that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just desperate for a little female companionship,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOh, there are females around. That has nothing to do with anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill\u2014you have to promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I need.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and looked down at her. He had warned himself of this and stupidly ignored his own warnings. He had to renew that trust. Fast. He lifted her chin with a finger and looked into her pretty, sad eyes. \u201cWould you like me to take you and Chloe to the Anderson ranch? If I promise not to kiss you anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you?\u201d she said. \u201cI want to take her, to see where she\u2019ll live. And I don\u2019t think I want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>Jack knew it was imperative that Mel regain her sense of control. He went back to the bar to get his truck and poked his head in. \u201cDoc, I\u2019m going to drive Mel and the baby out to Andersons\u2019. You okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d the old boy said, not looking up from his game.</p><p>When Mel had the few amassed baby things packed up, he took her. They had no car seat, so she held the baby\u2014and she got a little teary. But once they had traversed the long road up into the hills and were passing through the fenced pastures of grazing sheep, he could see that she was pulling herself together. Lilly Anderson brought them into her home\u2014a simple house that spoke of the abundance of life. The floors and windows were shining from the housekeeping attention they received; there were folded quilts on the ends of sofas and draped over chairs, crewel pictures on the walls, the smell of freshly baked bread, a pie cooling on the counter and dozens of pictures of children, of family, a collection that spanned many years. A wicker bassinet stood ready for Chloe. Lilly made Mel tea and they sat at the kitchen table and talked while Jack went with Buck to the corral where his grown sons had begun the spring shearing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, Lilly. I got pretty attached to her.\u201d</p><p>Lilly reached across the table for her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly understandable. You should come out here often, hold her, rock her. You should stay close.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to go through that\u2014when someone finally comes for her.\u201d</p><p>Lilly got tears in her eyes in sympathy with the tears Mel was showing. \u201cYou must be such a tender heart,\u201d Lilly said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mel\u2014now that I\u2019m a grandma, lots of little ones pass through here and don\u2019t stay. But while she\u2019s here, promise you won\u2019t be a stranger.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Lilly. For understanding. My women and their babies\u2014it\u2019s what I live for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shows. We\u2019re so lucky to have you with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not staying, you know....\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should think about that. This isn\u2019t a bad place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hang around long enough to be sure things are working out for Chloe. And I\u2019ll try to make it a few days before I\u2019m back to cuddle her,\u201d Mel said.</p> <p>\u201cYou come every day if you like. Twice a day.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t long before Mel joined Jack at the fence and stood watching the shearing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to come back for the lambing in a few weeks,\u201d Buck said. \u201cWe like to shear before the lambing\u2014it\u2019s easier on the sheep.\u201d</p><p>When they left the ranch, Jack drove around the hills of Virgin River. He didn\u2019t say anything\u2014he just let her see the beauty of the green fields, the high hills, grazing livestock. He took her for a little stretch along Highway 299 through a piece of the redwoods that, despite her morose mood, caused her to gasp in awe. The sky was still and blue, the breeze light and cool, but in the tallest trees it was dark except for those blinding flashes of bright sun that broke through. He could tell she was getting better, if slowly, quietly.</p><p>It was like this place was divided into two worlds\u2014the dank and dark world of the deep forest where life was bleak and poor, the people desperate. And this world, the national forest of redwoods, the first-rate campgrounds, the hills and valleys where the fields were lush and plentiful, where health and contentment abounded. Jack drove down a tree-canopied road toward the widest curve in the Virgin River, pulled the truck up to the edge and parked. There were two men in the river, waders held by suspenders, wearing tan fishing vests with many pockets and wicker creels held by shoulder straps, casting out into the water. The arcs of their lines were like a ballet, so graceful, so rhythmic.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted you to see a few things before you cut and run. This is where a lot of the town and visitors like to fish, where I mostly fish. When the winter rains come, we come out here to watch the salmon leap up over the natural waterfalls to return to their home creeks to spawn. It\u2019s really something to see. Now that the baby is at the Andersons\u2019, I\u2019ll take you to the coast if you like. Pretty soon the whales will be migrating north to cooler waters for the summer. They\u2019ll travel close to the coastline with their new calves and it\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><p>She watched the fishermen cast and reel in, then there was a catch. A good-sized brown trout.</p><p>\u201cDuring a good season, fish is the main staple on the menu at the bar,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMost of it you catch yourself?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMe and Preacher and Ricky. The best way to make work into play. Mel,\u201d he said, his voice soft. \u201cLook downstream. There...\u201d</p><p>She squinted and then sat back with a gasp. Poking their heads out of the brush at the side of the river on the other side was a mother bear and her cub.</p><p>\u201cYou were asking about the bear. Black bear. The cub looks young. They\u2019re just giving birth and coming out of hibernation. Have you ever seen anything like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly on the Discovery Channel. The fishermen don\u2019t see her?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they see her. She won\u2019t bother them and they won\u2019t bother her. But they carry bear repellent just in case. And they\u2019ll have a rifle in the truck\u2014but if she gets too close they\u2019ll just reel in their lines and sit in their trucks until she leaves.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cWatch while she eats their fish.\u201d</p><p>She watched in fascination for a moment, then said, \u201cWhy\u2019d you bring me here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, if something\u2019s eating me up\u2014I can come out here, or drive into the redwoods, or go up on the knoll where the sheep are grazing, or maybe out to a pasture where the cows roam, and just sit awhile. Just connect with the earth. Sometimes that\u2019s all I have to do.\u201d</p><p>One elbow sticking out of the window, wrist of the other hand balanced on the top of the steering wheel, Jack just watched the fishing\u2014the men and the bear. The men were so intent on their sport that they had never even turned around at the sound of the truck pulling into the clearing.</p><p>They were quiet. Jack had no idea what she might be thinking, but he thought, don\u2019t turn and run just because you got kissed. Things could be worse. After about twenty minutes, he started the truck. \u201cI have something to show you. You\u2019re in no hurry, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc\u2019s in town,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>Jack eventually pulled into the clearing where Hope McCrea\u2019s cabin sat. It was perfectly obvious he\u2019d like her to reconsider leaving. But she never expected him to do what he had done. As they pulled up to the cabin and parked, she looked at him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoap,\u201d he said. \u201cWood. Paint. Nails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have, Jack. Because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014because you\u2019re not staying. I\u2019ve heard that at least a hundred times over the past couple of weeks. That\u2019s fine. You\u2019ll do what you have to do. But this is what you were promised and I thought you ought to have the option.\u201d</p><p>Straight ahead of her was the little A-frame cabin with a new, strong, wide porch, painted red. Two white Adirondack chairs sat on the deck and four white pots holding red geraniums sat on the porch rails in the corners. It was beautiful. She was afraid to go inside. Did this mean that if it were lovely, she\u2019d be forced to stay? Because she knew it was going to be lovely.</p><p>Wordlessly, Mel got out of the truck. She slowly walked up the steps to the house, aware that Jack had not gotten out of the truck behind her. He was letting her go alone. She pushed open the door, which no longer stuck. Inside, the wood floors gleamed, the countertops sparkled. The windows, previously so grimy you couldn\u2019t see out, were so clean it seemed possible there was no glass. The window that had been boarded up was replaced. The appliances were spotless, the furniture had been so vigorously vacuumed or shampooed that the colors were now bright because there was no dust. There was a new area rug on the floor.</p><p>She wandered into the bedroom. A new comforter replaced the old and she could tell without even checking under the covers that a fat, firm mattress had been purchased and that the nasty soiled one was gone. The brightness of the sheets indicated these were not Hope\u2019s hand-me-downs, but newly purchased linen. On the floor beside the bed, a wide, thick rug. In the bathroom, new towels and accessories. The shower glass had been completely replaced and the tiles had been scrubbed to such a high sheen that even the grout was immaculate. There was the faintest smell of bleach; not a spot or stain remained. She loved the bright towels, alternating red and white. The rugs were white; the trash can, glass and tissue dispenser were red. There were two bedrooms downstairs and a small, open loft upstairs at the peak of the A-frame\u2014only large enough for a bed and maybe a small dresser. Both of them had been scoured clean, but they were empty of furniture. Back in the living room, she saw the fire had been laid and a fresh pile of wood sat at the side of the hearth. The books in the bookcases were dust free, the trunk that could be used as a coffee table had been polished with lemon oil. The cupboards shone with oil, as well. She opened one of them and saw there were new ceramic dishes to replace the dingy Melmac that had been there before. Graying old plastic was replaced with glass. A wine rack on the counter held four bottles.</p><p>Inside the refrigerator, which also gleamed, there were a few staples. A bottle of white wine was chilling, a six-pack of good beer. There was milk, orange juice, butter, bread, lettuce and other salad items. Bacon and eggs. Sandwich items\u2014lunch meat, cheese, mayo, mustard. On the kitchen table, which wore a pretty new tablecloth, sat a festive ceramic bowl holding fresh fruit. In the corner of the counter, a set of four thick, round white candles. She lowered her face and sniffed. Vanilla. She left the house, pulling the door closed behind her and went back to the truck. It made her melancholy, all that he\u2019d done. This was not what she\u2019d expected, either. Mel had come to terms with the fact that she\u2019d made a mistake. Now that she\u2019d accepted that, she was ready to move on. As soon as they could spare her.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was promised to you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re under no obligation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what did you hope?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe town needs you. Doc needs help, you can see that. I hoped you\u2019d give it a chance. A few more weeks, maybe. Just to see if it worked for you. I think the Virgin River folks have already made it clear\u2014it works for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you do this hoping it would force me to the terms of Hope\u2019s one-year contract?\u201d</p><p>she asked him. \u201cBecause as the place was, we were at an impasse. She couldn\u2019t hold me to it\u2014she hadn\u2019t met the terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will not force that contract,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cBut yes, she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She will not hold you to that contract. Guaranteed. I\u2019ll see to it. This is just for you\u2014not leverage for Hope.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head sadly. \u201cYou can see I don\u2019t belong here,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cAw. I don\u2019t know, Mel. People belong wherever they feel good. It can be a lot of different places. For a lot of different reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jack, look. Look at me. I\u2019m not a camper\u2014I\u2019m a shopper. I\u2019m really not one of those homespun country midwives. I\u2019m so citified, it\u2019s scary. I feel so out of place here. It\u2019s as if I\u2019m not like anyone. They don\u2019t make me feel that way, but I can\u2019t help it. I shouldn\u2019t be here, I should be at Nordstrom\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>She lowered her face into her hands and massaged her eyes. \u201cYou just don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s complicated, Jack. There\u2019s more to this than you realize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me. You can trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it\u2014one of the reasons I agreed to come here is so I wouldn\u2019t have to talk about it anymore. Let\u2019s say I made a crazy decision. An insane decision. The wrong decision. This isn\u2019t for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just burnout, was it?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI got rid of everything that tied me to L.A. and ran for my life. It was a panicked, crazy, irrational decision,\u201d she said. \u201cI was hurting all over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed as much. A man, maybe. A heartache or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose enough,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, Mel. This is as good a place as any to work through a heartache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, in a manner of speaking. But I didn\u2019t come here in a panic. I was looking for a place like this. Good fishing and hunting. Remote. Uncomplicated. Clean air, decent values, hardworking people who help each other out. It serves.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work for me in the long term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay\u2014no one asked you to make a long-term commitment. Well, no one except Hope, but no one really takes her seriously. But you shouldn\u2019t rush out of here with the same panic as you rushed in. It\u2019s a healthy place. It\u2019s a loving place. Who knows? You might find it helps you get through...whatever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.

But I figured, you don\u2019t have to stay at Doc\u2019s now, and if someone\u2019s going to give birth in your bedroom there, maybe it\u2019s time you have your own place. If you want it, that is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre there bears out here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt might be best if you kept your trash indoors, and drive it into town to put in the Dumpster. Bears so like garbage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for the love of God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a bad bear scare in ages.\u201d He reached across the console and squeezed her hand. \u201cJust give yourself a break. Work on your particular heartache. And while you do, take the occasional temperature. Give a pill now and then. No one\u2019s holding you hostage.\u201d</p><p>She watched him as he drove. That strong profile. He had a solid square face, straight nose, high cheekbones, bristle of stubble on his cheeks. He was a hairy guy; she noticed that he shaved his neck down to the top of his chest and she found herself wondering what was under his shirt. She remembered Mark\u2019s complaints of his receding hairline, which did nothing to detract from his boyish good looks. But this man, Jack, wasn\u2019t boyish. He had the hard good looks of a woodsman. And, though his hair was cropped short in that military buzz, it was so thick that it looked as if it should be thinned. The big hands on the steering wheel were calloused\u2014he worked hard. The guy was dripping in testosterone.</p> <p>What was this magnificent man doing locked away in a little town of six hundred, where there were no women for him? She wondered if he had the faintest clue about her\u2014that she had no heart. He had just given so much and she had absolutely nothing to give. Nothing. She was hollow inside. If she weren\u2019t, a man like Jack would appeal to her.</p><p>This was the worst thing about grief, she thought as she walked back to Doc\u2019s house. It emptied you. She should be flattered and pleased with what had been done for her in the renovating of the cabin. She should be thrilled that a man like Jack was interested in her, because clearly he was. But instead she was sad. She had lost the ability to be moved by these acts of kindness. Instead, it made her feel depressed and alone, because she didn\u2019t feel up to the task of receiving gifts and kindnesses graciously. She couldn\u2019t respond to a handsome man\u2019s interest. She couldn\u2019t be happy. Sometimes she asked herself if she was paying some tribute to Mark\u2019s memory by hanging on to the sadness of losing him.</p><p>Ricky worked at the bar after school every day and some weekends, whenever Jack wanted him. He dropped Liz at the store after school, then parked behind the bar next to Jack\u2019s and Preacher\u2019s trucks. As he was going in, Jack was coming out. \u201cGrab your gear,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to run out to the river, see if we can make a catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything out there now,\u201d Ricky said. The good catch was in the fall and winter, dwindling by spring, starting to pick up again in summer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll cast a while,\u201d Jack said. \u201cSee what you got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreacher coming?\u201d Ricky asked, going to the storeroom in the kitchen to get his rod, reel and waders.</p> <p>\u201cNah. He\u2019s busy.\u201d</p><p>Jack remembered the first day he\u2019d met Ricky. The kid had been thirteen and had ridden his bike up to the cabin that would become the bar. Skinny and freckle-faced with the most engaging grin and sweetest disposition. He let him hang around, help with the carpentry during the renovation if he could pay attention. When he found out it was just Ricky and his grandma, Lydie, he kind of took him under his wing. He\u2019d watched the boy grow tall and strong; Jack taught him to fish, shoot. Now he was damn near a man. Physically, he didn\u2019t have far to go, but mentally and emotionally, sixteen was still just sixteen.</p><p>At the river\u2019s edge, they cast their lines a few times and then it came. The real reason for fishing when there were few fish. \u201cYou and I should have a little talk, I think,\u201d</p><p>Jack said.</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t look at him. He just cast in long beautiful arcs. And said, \u201cAbout all the places you can put your dick that aren\u2019t statutory.\u201d</p><p>Ricky snapped his head around and looked at Jack\u2019s profile. Jack turned his head and met the boy\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fourteen,\u201d Jack said.</p> <p>Ricky looked back at the river, silent.</p><p>\u201cI know she doesn\u2019t look fourteen. She\u2019s fourteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d Ricky said.</p><p>Jack laughed. \u201cOh, gimme a break. I saw your truck over at Connie\u2019s the first Friday night she was in town\u2014you moved on her fast. You want to stick with that story?\u201d He reeled in and turned toward Ricky. \u201cListen, son, you have to keep your head. You hear me, Rick? Because this is dangerous ground you\u2019re on. She\u2019s a little hottie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a sweet girl,\u201d Rick said defensively.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already hooked,\u201d Jack said, hoping they weren\u2019t already doomed. \u201cHow hooked?\u201d</p><p>Ricky shrugged. \u201cI like her. I know she\u2019s young, but she doesn\u2019t seem that young, and I like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jack said, taking a breath. \u201cOkay, maybe we should talk about the things you can do to avoid putting your sixteen-year-old swimmers in contact with her fourteenyear-old eggs. Hmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Ricky said, casting. And casting pretty badly.</p><p>\u201cAw, Jesus. You\u2019re already involved. Physically, huh?\u201d Rick didn\u2019t answer and Jack thought, who knew what they were up to. Jack remembered only too well the things experimental kids could do to get a little satisfaction without going all the way. It was a frickin\u2019 art form. Problem was, it just didn\u2019t last, and the closer you got, the greater potential for slip-ups. Sometimes it made more sense to decide you were going all the way with good birth control in place, rather than risk an accident. But man, you should be older. Older. \u201cAw, Jesus.\u201d Jack took a breath. He dug down into his waders, down into the pocket of his jeans. He pulled out a fist full of condoms. \u201cThis is tough, Rick, because I don\u2019t want you to use these on her, and I don\u2019t want you not to. I\u2019m stuck here. Help me out, will you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jack. I\u2019m not going to do her. She\u2019s fourteen.\u201d</p><p>Jack reached out and tousled his hair. Those freckles had given way to the stubble of a young beard; he wasn\u2019t skinny anymore. The work he did at the bar plus the pastimes of hunting and fishing, not to mention chores for his grandma had bulked the kid up and his shoulders and arms were muscled. Handsome kid, he thought. Real grown-up. He had a lot of responsibility\u2014he worked hard, maintained his grades, did every physical thing around his grandma\u2019s house that needed doing. With Jack\u2019s supervision, Rick had painted her house. All that built toward creating a solid, reliable man\u2014one who shouldn\u2019t get shot in the foot by a teenage pregnancy.</p><p>\u201cSo, how old were you?\u201d Ricky asked him.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Bout your age. But the girl was much older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay older than Lizzie. Older than me. Smarter than me.\u201d He handed Rick the condoms and although Rick\u2019s cheeks took on a dark stain, he accepted them. \u201cI know you\u2019re at that age\u2014I was that age once. You know what the problem is. She might not look so young, but she\u2019s got a long way to go yet. Huh?\u201d</p><p>A shiver went through Ricky and Jack caught it. Well, it\u2019s not as though he had been oblivious to Lizzie\u2019s rather over-matured charms. Thus the talk. \u201cYeah,\u201d Ricky said, a little breathless.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s be sure you know some things,\u201d Jack said. \u201cYou know that old business about pulling out in time\u2014you know that doesn\u2019t work. Right? And trying to not put it all the way in? Useless. First of all, if you can do that, you\u2019re a stronger man than I am, and even if you can, it\u2019s not good enough\u2014you can still get her pregnant. You know these things, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRick, you understand, if there\u2019s no backing out of this relationship with her and if there\u2019s a strong potential for it to get more serious rather than less, you might have to be the one to take charge. Draw a line in the sand\u2014insist on birth control at least. You got a midwife in town\u2014there\u2019s help available. For Liz. I think she\u2019s too young to be having sex, personally. But I know she\u2019s too young to be pregnant. You with me here, buddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I have it under control. But thanks, Jack. I know you just want me to do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich includes not getting caught off guard. If it\u2019s getting close, you get her fixed up. Double protection\u2014hers and yours. You have to use the head with the brain in it. Believe me, I\u2019ve seen more than one good man go down because he was thinking with his dick.\u201d He watched Ricky\u2019s chin lower as he looked down and he knew. Liz was irresistible to him. He was fighting for his life. His pants were on fire.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ricky said. \u201cI hear ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make sure you always have a condom, okay? It\u2019s your responsibility to keep her safe, son. If you use even one condom, Rick, you get her to Mel. Right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have to talk about this anymore?\u201d</p><p>Jack grabbed the boy\u2019s arm and felt solid biceps in his grasp. Damn, Ricky was nearly six feet and still growing. \u201cYou wanna be a man, son? You have to think like one. It\u2019s not enough to just feel like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. Then, \u201cBy the way, it\u2019s not statutory unless I\u2019m over eighteen.\u201d</p><p>Jack laughed in spite of himself. \u201cToo smart for your own goddamn good, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so, Jack. Holy God, I hope so.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Mel talked to Joey at least every other day, sometimes everyday. She would place the call from Doc\u2019s when she had a free minute and Joey would call her back so it wasn\u2019t on his nickel. She sent her digital pictures of the renovation of the cabin from Doc\u2019s computer and Joey, being an interior decorator, was fascinated by all the building and refinishing Jack had done. Then Mel told Joey that she was going to stay a little longer. A few weeks. At least long enough to be sure Chloe was doing well with Lilly. She loved the little cabin and wanted to see Polly through her delivery. She didn\u2019t tell Jack. But by her daily presence at the grill, he came to realize that she was giving it a chance, and he couldn\u2019t hide the fact that it pleased him. She and Doc played gin, Mel walked down to the store in time to watch the soap with Connie and Joy, and spent a large amount of time at the bar. Joy, who was not a librarian, was the person who opened up the little library on Tuesdays\u2014and Mel was always there. It was about ten by twelve feet, crammed with books, mostly paperbacks with the stamps from secondhand stores inside the covers. It was the only entertainment Mel had when she went home at night.</p><p>Mel learned that Lydie Sudder had poor general health when Doc sent her down to the Sudder house to deliver diabetic testing supplies, insulin and syringes. Lydie, beside being diabetic and arthritic, had a weak heart, but Mel was surprised to find that the little house she shared with Ricky was very well kept and nicely furnished; Lydie somehow managed to keep up with things. She got around slowly, but her smile was kind and her manners delightful. Of course, she wouldn\u2019t let Mel out of the house without tea and cookies. She was still there, visiting with Lydie on the front porch, when Ricky came home from school, driving up in his little white truck.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mel,\u201d he said. He leaned down and kissed his grandmother\u2019s cheek. \u201cHi, Gram. I\u2019m going to work if you don\u2019t need anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just fine, Ricky,\u201d she said, patting his hand.</p><p>\u201cCall me if you need me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you something of Preacher\u2019s later.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat would be nice, honey.\u201d</p><p>The boy went inside to drop off his books, then out again, jumping off the porch steps and back into his truck to drive the whole block to the bar. \u201cI guess a man can\u2019t be separated from his wheels,\u201d Mel observed.</p><p>\u201cThat appears to be the case.\u201d Lydie laughed.</p><p>The next day she sat at the grill at lunchtime with Connie. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard you say you\u2019re leaving for days now,\u201d Connie said. \u201cSomething change on that score?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a great deal,\u201d Mel said. \u201cBut since Jack went to such a lot of trouble to work on that cabin, I thought I owed it to him to give it a few weeks. I can deliver Polly\u2019s baby.\u201d</p> <p>Connie glanced at the bar where Jack was setting up lunch in front of a couple of fishermen. She gave a nod in his direction. \u201cBet that makes Jack real happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems to think the town can use me, even if Doc doesn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Connie laughed at her. \u201cGirl, you need glasses. The way Jack looks at you, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about Doc. Or the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t see me looking back in any particular way, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should. There isn\u2019t a woman within a hundred square miles wouldn\u2019t leave her husband for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven you?\u201d Mel asked with a laugh.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m different,\u201d she said, drinking her coffee. \u201cI married Ron when I was about seven.\u201d She took a drink of her coffee. \u201cBut okay\u2014if he begged me, I\u2019d leave Ron for him.\u201d</p><p>Mel laughed at her. \u201cIt is pretty strange that no one\u2019s latched on to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard he was seeing a woman in Clear River. Don\u2019t know how serious it is. Might be nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know her? The woman he\u2019s seeing?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, but lifted one curious brow at Mel\u2019s obvious interest. \u201cHe\u2019s private, isn\u2019t he? Doesn\u2019t let anything slip. But he can\u2019t hide those looks he sends your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t waste his time,\u201d she said. I\u2019m not available, she didn\u2019t add. In her new abode, Mel had put her own favorite books on the shelves\u2014all of which she had already read and reread\u2014and Mark\u2019s picture on the table beside the bed. Each night she told him how much she missed him. But she cried less. Maybe because of the way Jack looked at her. The soothing way he talked to her. The house Mel sold in L.A. was almost four thousand square feet and it had never seemed too big; she had loved the spaciousness of the rooms. Yet the cabin, maybe twelve hundred square feet total, felt right. Like a cocoon. It hugged her. One of her favorite parts of the day was at the end, before she drove out to her new cabin. She would go to the bar for a cold beer and some chips or cheese and crackers. Once in a while she had dinner, but she didn\u2019t mind being by herself at her cabin where there was now food in the cupboard.</p><p>Jack put her cold beer in front of her. \u201cWe have macaroni and cheese tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cI can talk Preacher into putting a slice of ham with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019m going home for dinner tonight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re cooking?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d she said. \u201cI cook things like sandwiches. Coffee. The occasional fried egg. And takeout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA modern woman.\u201d He laughed. \u201cBut that place is working out for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful, thanks. And I need the quiet. Did you know Doc snores like a freight train?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cDoesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI picked up a little gossip about you. That you\u2019re seeing a woman in Clear River?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look all that surprised. He lifted his brows and his coffee mug. \u201cSeeing?</p><p>That sounds a little delicate for this crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was glad to hear you have someone in your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cAncient history. And I wasn\u2019t exactly seeing her. It was a lot more basic than that.\u201d</p><p>Somehow, that made her smile. \u201cSounds like maybe you had some kind of arrangement.\u201d</p><p>He sipped from his mug and gave a shrug. \u201cIt was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me any explanation.\u201d</p><p>He put both hands on the bar and leaned toward her. \u201cWe had an understanding. I went to her place once in a while. For an evening. Nothing deep. No love affair. Casual sex, Mel, between consenting adults. When I realized it didn\u2019t work for me, we parted as friends. I\u2019m not with a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s kind of too bad,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a permanent condition,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just how it is right now. Want a slice of pie to take home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Mel had been in Virgin River four weeks. In that time, patients and friends dropped by frequently. Some had a little cash for medical services, a few had insurance, but the majority had produce from their farms, ranches, orchards, vineyards or kitchens. The latter, knowing that a single loaf of bread or pie probably didn\u2019t cover the cost of an exam and treatment or medication, tended to stop by with a little something even when they were well. The unprepared food\u2014a bushel of apples or nuts, canned or fresh fruit, vegetables, berries, lamb shank or veal, would go right over to Preacher, who could make good use of it, later feeding some of it to Mel and Doc. In some ways, it was like a commune.</p><p>That usually left Doc and Mel with more food than they could use, especially since they were getting most of their meals at Jack\u2019s. Mel packed up a box of some stuff that was likely to go bad soon\u2014some eggs, bread, sliced ham and a brick of cheese, a pie, apples and nuts. A carton of orange juice she\u2019d picked up from Connie. She put the box in the passenger seat of Doc\u2019s old truck before she asked him, \u201cCould I borrow your truck for a couple hours? I want to drive around some and I don\u2019t really trust the BMW. I promise, I\u2019ll be real careful with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy truck? I can\u2019t see you in my truck,\u201d he said doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I\u2019ll gas it up, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried about you driving it off a cliff and leaving me with that piece of shit you call a car.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cSome days, you\u2019re more than I can take. Really.\u201d</p><p>He picked up his keys and flipped them at her. She caught them. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt the truck. As God is my witness, I will never be caught driving that foreign job.\u201d</p><p>She drove his truck out of town and the minute she was on the winding mountain roads, in the trees, driving up up up and then down down down over the mountain, her heart started to beat a little wildly. She was afraid, plain and simple. But she\u2019d been haunted for two weeks and couldn\u2019t live with the feeling. And that brought a plan into focus.</p><p>She surprised herself by remembering where Clifford Paulis\u2019s camp was. She wondered if she was driven by some psychic energy. Her sense of direction in the hills, through the trees, was perfectly lousy. But\u2014before long she was there, recognizing the nearly invisible old logging road that led to their compound. She drove in, made a big turn inside the opening so that she was pointed toward the way out, and then got out of the truck. She stood right beside the driver\u2019s door and yelled,</p><p>\u201cClifford!\u201d</p><p>No one appeared immediately, but in a few moments a bearded man came out from around a camper shell that had been pulled off a pickup and she recognized him as one of the men she\u2019d seen on her last visit. She crooked her finger at him, beckoning him to her. He shuffled slowly toward her and as he neared, she reached back into the truck and pulled out the box. \u201cI thought maybe you guys could use this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was going to waste at the clinic.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her dumbly.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d she said, pushing the box toward him. \u201cNo strings. Just a little neighborly gesture.\u201d</p><p>He seemed to take the box reluctantly. He looked inside.</p><p>She dazzled him with her prettiest smile. When he smiled back, his teeth were godawful, but she didn\u2019t react. After all, she\u2019d seen people like him before. But before, she\u2019d call one agency or another, hand them off, clear her charts. It was different out here.</p><p>She got in the truck and put it in gear to leave. In the rearview mirror she saw him hurrying toward that camper shell, and a couple of guys had come out from behind and joined him. It made her heart feel better. Good.</p><p>When she got back to town, she returned the keys to Doc, who sat behind his desk in his cramped office. \u201cI guess you think I don\u2019t know what you did,\u201d he said. She lifted her chin in some defiance. \u201cI thought I told you\u2014stay away from there. It isn\u2019t an innocent place and no one knows what might happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I told you not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid we have some understanding? That I was going to follow your nonmedical orders? Because I don\u2019t recall that in my personal life, I\u2019m obligated to do everything you tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019re not obligated to use your brain in your personal life, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI filled your truck up with gas, you old pain in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get caught in that piece of shit foreign job of yours, you obstinate little strumpet.\u201d</p><p>And she laughed at him so hard, tears came to her eyes and she had to leave, laughing all the way back to her cabin.</p><p>It was a bright and sunny afternoon when Mel went to Doc\u2019s office. She tapped lightly and stuck her head in. \u201cDo you have any idea what\u2019s taking social services so long to do something about Chloe?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cCertainly don\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should do a follow-up\u2014give them a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said I\u2019d take care of it,\u201d he answered, not looking up.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that\u2014you know\u2014I got attached. I didn\u2019t mean to, didn\u2019t intend to, but there it is. I\u2019d hate for Lilly Anderson to go through that withdrawal. It doesn\u2019t feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s raised a passel of kids. She knows the score.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but...\u201d She stopped talking as she heard the front door open. She leaned out of his office and looked down the hall. Right inside the door stood Polly. She seemed to be holding her belly up with her hands and instead of that usual glow on her cheeks, she looked just a bit pale. Nervous. Right behind her was a young man in almost identical overalls, holding a small, worn suitcase. Mel looked back at Doc and said,</p><p>\u201cShowtime.\u201d</p><p>Polly wasn\u2019t even sure how far apart the pains were. \u201cIt feels like one big one,\u201d she said. \u201cMostly down real low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s just go upstairs and get settled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan Darryl come?\u201d</p><p>Mel reached over and took the suitcase from Darryl. \u201cOf course. That would help a lot. I\u2019m going to concentrate on you.\u201d She took Polly\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Once upstairs, she had Polly sit in the rocker while she went about the business of getting a bed ready with the plastic mattress protector and clean sheets. \u201cGood timing, Polly. My cottage was ready at the same time my littlest patient went out to Lilly Anderson\u2019s ranch to stay. I\u2019m all moved out and you, Darryl and the baby can have the whole room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrrgggghhhh,\u201d Polly answered, grabbing her belly and leaning forward. There was a slightly muffled sound that preceded the soft dripping of amniotic fluids onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cOh, Polly!\u201d Darryl exclaimed. He looked suddenly stricken. Embarrassed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mel said, looking over her shoulder. \u201cThat should speed things up. Just stay put until the bed\u2019s ready and I can help you change.\u201d</p><p>A half hour later Polly sat up in the hospital bed, not terribly comfortable on a couple of towels, her green hospital gown stretched over her belly. Mel had changed into a pair of scrubs and Nikes she\u2019d packed for just such an event. If this were L.A., the anesthesiologist would be on his way to check her and discuss the epidural, but this was the country, no anesthesia here. Doc came around right after Mel had given Polly a pelvic to see how far she had dilated, and then upon noting Darryl\u2019s pallor, he said,</p> <p>\u201cYoung man\u2014let\u2019s you and me wander across the street and have a drop of courage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarryl, don\u2019t leave me!\u201d Polly begged.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be right back, and I won\u2019t leave you,\u201d Mel promised. \u201cBut sweetheart, you\u2019re only at four centimeters\u2014it\u2019s going to be a while.\u201d</p><p>Good to her word, Mel stayed at her side. She wasn\u2019t sure what she had expected the situation to be like, but was admittedly surprised by a few things. One\u2014Doc Mullins stayed out of her way and let her have the case even though Polly had been his patient. Two, he took on the job of watching Darryl in case it became necessary to take the lad out of the room. Doc was staying up long after his usual bedtime. And, the few times Mel wandered out of the patient\u2019s room through the night to fetch supplies or a fresh cup of coffee, she looked across the street to see the lights were on and the Open sign lit at Jack\u2019s. He kept the bar open all night.</p><p>Polly\u2019s labor intensified slowly as the hours ticked by, but she remained stable and progressed normally. Mel had her up walking, squatting, getting gravity on their side. She had Darryl hold her forward while she rocked her hips side to side and at threethirty in the morning, Polly began to push. The girl was most comfortable on her side, so Darryl and Mel joined forces to help her deliver in that position. Mel had Polly lie on her side in the fetal position, the leg beneath her tucked up and under while Polly and Darryl together lifted the upper leg to clear the field of birth. It was a big first baby and Polly couldn\u2019t have managed that position, pushing for so long, without a good assistant. It was important that the mother have whatever control she could, trusting her body; it made the whole experience so much more beautiful. Darryl held up pretty well despite the fact that it was difficult to watch his young wife in pain, and the sight of blood, even though he\u2019d slaughtered his share of pigs, was clearly tough on him.</p> <p>At four-thirty Polly\u2019s baby emerged after an hour of pushing. Mel cut the cord, wrapped the baby and passed him to his father. \u201cMr. Fishburn,\u201d she said to Darryl,</p><p>\u201cthere is another Mr. Fishburn in the family. Please help Polly get your son situated on her breast\u2014it\u2019ll help her deliver the placenta and slow the bleeding.\u201d</p><p>This was so much more like a scene from Gone With The Wind than the type of midwifery Mel had known in a large, well-equipped city hospital. While Doc checked over the newborn, Mel cleaned up the mother with soap and water and changed her sheets and bedclothes.</p><p>By six-thirty in the morning, physically exhausted but wired on caffeine, Mel\u2019s work was done. The baby would reside in the room with Polly, and Darryl could have the other bed if he wanted it. It took them both about sixty seconds to fall into a deep sleep. Mel washed her face, rinsed her mouth with a little mouthwash, let her hair out of the clip that had held it on top of her head and went looking for Doc.</p><p>\u201cGo to bed, Doc,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a long night. I\u2019ll keep the office open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t sleep in daylight, and you did all the work. I\u2019ll keep an eye on the Fishburns. Go to your place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll make a deal with you. I\u2019ll go take a nap and come back in early afternoon to spell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll do,\u201d he said. Then, peering over his glasses, added, \u201cNot bad. For a city girl.\u201d</p><p>The sun was just peeking over the mountains, bathing the little town in pinkish beige rays. The April air was cold. She pulled her wool jacket around herself and sat on Doc\u2019s front porch, feeling exhilarated, and perhaps a little too wound up for sleep right away.</p><p>Polly had done well, for a mere girl. No Lamaze training for those two, and no drugs. There had been some powerful grunting, groaning and straining; Darryl had grunted along with his wife with such sincerity, it was lucky he didn\u2019t mess his pants. Nice, big, eight-pound country baby. There was nothing in this world like pulling a squalling infant from its mother\u2019s womb; no panacea for a breaking heart could do more. This didn\u2019t throw Mel into a stupor of longing or depression because this was her life\u2019s work\u2014what she loved. And she loved it so much more when the couple was happy and excited, the baby robust and healthy. Holding the baby she had just delivered, handing it to its mother and watching it suckle hungrily\u2014it was like seeing God before you.</p><p>She heard a loud thwack. And another. She had no idea what time Jack\u2019s usually opened. It was only six-thirty. Another loud thwack, coming from his place. She went down the porch stairs and across the street. Behind the bar there was a big brick barbecue. Wearing boots, jeans and a flannel shirt, and hefting a heavy ax, Jack was splitting logs on a tree stump. She just stood there watching him for a moment. Thwack, thwack, thwack.</p><p>He looked up from his chore to see her leaning against the side of the building, pulling her jacket tight over turquoise scrubs. She had no idea that what made him grin at her was the huge toothy smile she wore. \u201cWell?\u201d he said, leaning the ax against the tree stump.</p><p>\u201cBaby boy. Big baby boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone is okay?\u201d</p> <p>She walked toward him. \u201cThey\u2019re better than okay. Polly did great, the baby is strong, healthy, and Darryl is expected to recover.\u201d And then she laughed, throwing her head back. Nothing, nothing was more satisfying than coming out of a delivery with onehundred-percent success. \u201cMy first country birth. Harder on Mom than on me. In the city, it\u2019s always an option to just roll over, bare your spine, and labor in comfort from an epidural. Women out here are made of steel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that,\u201d he said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cKnow what Doc said? \u2018Not bad for a city girl.\u2019\u201d She reached for his hand. \u201cDid you stay open all night?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI nodded off by the fire a couple of times. But you never know when someone might need something. Boiling water. Ice. A stiff drink. You want some coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I think it would make me barf. I\u2019ve had enough coffee to jangle even the nerves of a caffeine junkie.\u201d Uncharacteristically, she wrapped her arms around his waist and hugged him. This man had become her closest friend. \u201cJack, it was wonderful. I had forgotten how wonderful. I haven\u2019t delivered a baby in, gee, almost a year, I think.\u201d</p><p>She looked up into his eyes. \u201cDamn, we did a good piece of work. Me, Mom and Dad. Damn.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed a little hair off her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was so awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? I knew you\u2019d find something here to sink your teeth into.\u201d He reached down, crossed his arms under her bottom and lifted her straight up so that her face was even with his.</p><p>\u201cNowwww, what did we decide?\u201d she asked, but her tone was teasing. Her smile was playful.</p><p>\u201cWe decided that I would not kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should have talked about this,\u201d she added, but she certainly didn\u2019t struggle. In fact, this seemed oddly right. Celebratory. Like being picked up and swung around after the win of a big game. And that was how she felt\u2014as though she\u2019d just scored a touchdown. Arms resting on his shoulders, she clasped her hands behind his head.</p><p>\u201cWe further decided that if you kissed me, I would let you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fishing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this look like fishing to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBegging?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing exactly as I\u2019ve been told. Waiting.\u201d</p><p>What the hell, she thought. Absolutely nothing could feel better after the night she\u2019d just spent than to plant a big wet one on this guy\u2014a guy who\u2019d keep his business open all night just in case they needed something. So she laid one on him. She slid her lips over his, opening them, moving over his with wicked and delicious intent, getting her tongue involved. And he did nothing but hold her there, allowing this.</p><p>\u201cDid you not like that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said. \u201cAm I allowed to respond?\u201d</p><p>She whacked him softly in the head, making him laugh. She tried it again, and this time it was much more interesting. It made her heart beat faster, made her breathe hard. Yes, she thought. It is okay to feel something that doesn\u2019t hurt sometimes. This wasn\u2019t because she was grief-stricken or needy, this was because she was victorious. And all she could think about at the moment was his delicious mouth. When their mouths came apart, she said, \u201cI feel like a total champ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are,\u201d he said, enjoying her mood more than she would ever guess. \u201cGod, you taste good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t taste that bad,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cPut me down now,\u201d she instructed.</p><p>\u201cNo. Do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but only one more, then you have to behave.\u201d</p><p>She planted another one on him, thoroughly enjoying his lips and tongue, the strength of the arms that held her. She refused to worry about whether this was a mistake. She was here, she was happy for once, and his mouth felt as natural to hers as if she\u2019d been kissing him for years. She let the kiss be a little longer and deeper than she thought prudent, and even that made her smile.</p><p>When it was over, he put her on her feet. \u201cWhew,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have nearly enough births in this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have another one in about six weeks. And if you\u2019re very, very good...\u201d</p><p>Ah, he thought. That gives me six weeks. He touched the end of her nose. \u201cNothing wrong with a little kissing, Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t get ideas?\u201d</p><p>He bellowed. \u201cYou can make me behave, it turns out. But you can\u2019t keep me from getting ideas.\u201d</p><p>April waned and May brought out the early spring flowers; foxgloves and Queen Anne\u2019s lace grew wild along the roads. Australian Fern blanketed the earth beneath the big trees. Every week or ten days, Mel borrowed Doc\u2019s truck, took a little lip from him, and delivered a box of food to the Paulis camp that would otherwise go to waste. Doc would have no part of it and scolded her. She ignored him indignantly and that alone made her feel good. It made her heart pound wildly as she went, and beat with satisfaction as she returned to Virgin River.</p><p>The cabin was turning out to be a haven for Mel. She purchased a small TV on which she got terrible reception. If she were staying, she\u2019d get a satellite dish, but she was only committed to a few more weeks. And one day she came home from the clinic to find she had a telephone in her kitchen and bedroom. Jack spoke to Harv, telephone lineman for the county, and had stressed Mel\u2019s occupation as midwife to get her phone installed ahead of schedule. He got another kiss for that\u2014behind the bar where no one could see. Okay, two or three kisses. Deep and long. Strong and delicious. Living and sleeping in the cabin in the woods was as restful and peaceful as anything Mel had known in almost a year. She woke in the early mornings, in time to see the sun slowly creeping over the tall pines, to hear the birds singing. She liked to get a cup of coffee and go out on that new, strong porch and enjoy the clean morning air, still cold on early spring mornings.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t yet 6:00 a.m. when she opened her front door and there, before her, were at least a dozen deer, grazing contentedly on the grass, bushes and ferns at the edges of her clearing. She took note of the freckled fawns\u2014it was spring and time for birthing of all sorts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She went for her digital camera and snapped a few sneaky shots. Then she loaded the pictures onto her laptop and dialed up the Internet, which took forever, but there was nothing faster out here. After she had sent the pictures to Joey, she called her.</p><p>\u201cGo online,\u201d she told her sister. \u201cI\u2019ve sent you something amazing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJust hurry,\u201d Mel said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to love it.\u201d</p><p>There was only a short wait as Joey could get online and download in seconds as opposed to the length of time it took Mel. She heard her sister gasp. \u201cDeer!\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIn my front yard,\u201d Mel said. \u201cLook at the babies. Aren\u2019t they adorable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they still there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m looking out my kitchen window at them right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving the house until they\u2019re done with breakfast. Isn\u2019t that the most wonderful thing you\u2019ve ever seen? Joey, I\u2019m staying a little longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mel\u2014No! I want you to come here! Why are you staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoey, I\u2019m delivering another baby pretty soon. After that last one, I can\u2019t resist. It just isn\u2019t like in the hospital where everything\u2019s so sterile and artificial and there\u2019s a surgeon and anesthesiologist right down the hall. It\u2019s just me and her, getting the job done. So pristine and wonderful and natural. So country\u2014like Doc taking Mom\u2019s twenty-year-old husband across the street to the bar for a shot of courage so he can be a less nervous assistant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, lovely,\u201d Joey said sarcastically, causing Mel to laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt was fantastic,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThere\u2019s another pregnant woman in town and I\u2019m thinking of staying for her, too. The cabin is just great\u2014you saw the pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw. Mel, are you dressed for the day?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at your feet. Tell me what\u2019s on your feet.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cMy Cole Haan boots. I love these boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey cost over four hundred dollars!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re starting to look like crap, too,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you only knew where I\u2019ve been...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel, you\u2019re not one of them. Don\u2019t get them depending on you. Come to Colorado. We can accommodate your shoe fetish and you can find a good job here\u2014close to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sleep so well here,\u201d she said. \u201cI was afraid I\u2019d never sleep well again\u2014it\u2019s probably the air. It\u2019s so unbelievable, it almost wears you out\u2014by the end of the day the bed feels so good. The pace is slower. I\u2019ve needed a slower pace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you that busy? With patients?\u201d Joey asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot that much. They\u2019re very sparse, actually. We only make well-visit appointments on Wednesdays and the rest of the week they either wander in with one complaint or another, or Doc goes to them. I go along most of the time. Or people wander in to talk, or drop off a pie, or some fresh baked dinner rolls. But the women\u2014the pregnant ones\u2014are so relieved after one look at my hands, compared to Doc\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do with yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, laughing, \u201cevery day I walk down to the corner store to watch a soap with Connie and Joy, two middle-aged best friends who have been watching televised adultery on Riverside Falls for about fifteen years. The side comments are more interesting than the show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGawd,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI go out to the Anderson ranch and hold the baby\u2014Chloe. She\u2019s thriving there, and so is Lilly. More and more I know that was the right thing to do, and it just fell in my lap. Sometimes I take some of our leftover food out to this bunch of bums in the forest\u2014they look so thin and hungry, but Doc says they\u2019ll probably bury us all. I stop by the bar to see if anyone\u2019s playing cribbage. If I can reel him in, Doc and I play gin\u2014but it\u2019s hard to catch him in the mood. He taught me to play and now he can\u2019t beat me. Penny a point\u2014I\u2019m funding my retirement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014when do you think you\u2019re going to get over this break from sanity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Just let me think about it. I\u2019ve only been here a couple of months\u2014it\u2019s not an eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I hate to think of you rotting away in some dinky town, watching the soaps and growing bad roots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could visit Dot in that garage where she does hair...\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh. Aren\u2019t you lonely, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much. At the end of the day, if nothing\u2019s going on, we go to the bar\u2014Doc has his one whiskey of the day and I get a cold beer. There are always people around. We eat dinner\u2014someone usually says, come over and sit with us. There\u2019s great gossip, that\u2019s the cool part about small towns where everyone knows everyone\u2019s business. Except, apparently, who gave birth to little Chloe. I just count it lucky that no woman who suffered post-partum hemorrhage or infection turned up. And also\u2014no word from social services.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you so much. This is about the longest we\u2019ve been apart in years...Why do you sound happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I? Maybe because everyone around me is happy. They let me know they\u2019re glad I\u2019m here, even if my presence isn\u2019t medically saving this town.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cI still feel out of place a lot, but I think I\u2019m more content than I\u2019ve been in eleven months and three days. I might finally be detoxing from the adrenaline.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019re not going to stay in that godforsaken place, alone, watching soaps and drinking beer.\u201d</p><p>Mel\u2019s voice became soft. \u201cIt\u2019s not godforsaken, Joey. It\u2019s...\u201d She struggled for a word. \u201cIt\u2019s breathtaking. Oh, the architecture leaves something to be desired\u2014most of the houses and buildings are small and old and could use paint. But the countryside is wondrous. And I\u2019m not lonely\u2014I have a town. I\u2019ve never had a town before.\u201d</p><p>Ricky and Liz were going to the spring dance at the high school. Except they didn\u2019t. It gave Rick a twinge of guilt because he knew in his heart that Connie and Ron trusted him. And probably they shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>The thing about living in a small town in the midst of dozens of small towns separated by forests was there were a million secluded places to park and make out. He always had a condom in his pocket, one that he was determined not to have to use, but he had it just the same. He hadn\u2019t even needed Jack to supply him\u2014he was on top of that. He felt protective toward Liz; he didn\u2019t want to get her into trouble. What they were doing was working, even if it was getting them pretty worked up. And they were doing plenty. It got off to a roaring start. Lots of deep kissing, heavy petting, incredible rubbing. They\u2019d done a lot of bumping and grinding on the outside of clothes, but now they were getting right down to the skin, deeper than skin, but not going all the way. They were catching on real fast. It hadn\u2019t taken them long to figure out how to have orgasms without penetration, for which Rick was sublimely grateful. Even so, he wanted more. Wanted it real bad, and so did she. He was about ready to have the big talk with her, but he knew he had to save it for the clear light of day, not the dark of night while they were pawing each other in the cab of his little truck. He loved making her feel good; she really wanted to please him. He hadn\u2019t imagined it could be this wonderful\u2014holding someone, loving them, touching them, giving these feelings, receiving them. Nothing had prepared him for how you could be swept away by it all; it was as though the sheer pleasure had a life of its own. He had moved over to the passenger seat and held her on his lap, kissing her, hard and hot while she squirmed around deliciously.</p><p>His hand wandered under her short skirt and met with...Nothing.</p><p>\u201cOh my Jesus,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cSurprise,\u201d she said, grinding on his lap. Then her hand went there, feeling him through his clothes, making him nearly cry out.</p><p>She scooted forward on his lap a little. He slid back in the seat slightly, knowing that she would now take him in her small hand. He lived for that. As she opened his pants to free him, he massaged her with his fingers of one hand, fondling her breast with the other, drowning in her mouth, holding her tight against him. She was moving roughly against his hand, wriggling, reaching desperately for her special moment, when suddenly she shifted her weight slightly. She was straining toward him, he was straining toward her, her hands went to his shoulders, his hands grabbed her fanny, her knee went across his lap and she was over him. She moved down, he moved up and they were suddenly disastrously, wondrously, exquisitely merged. She came right down on him. He lifted right up into her; she was all around him. It was a whole new world, a lot better than a hand. He couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>\u201cHoly God, Liz,\u201d he whispered. \u201cOh my Jesus.\u201d</p><p>She was oblivious, pressing furiously into his lap, on a mission.</p><p>\u201cLiz. Lizzie. No. Lizzie. Holy God. Holy Jesus.\u201d</p><p>He was half trying, half hoping to fail to lift her off him, to get out of her, when it happened for her and the sensation of her body squeezing around him, clenching in hot spasms as she moaned her ecstacy, caused him to lose his mind. He thought he might have been momentarily unconscious. He lost all will. And that wasn\u2019t all he lost. He blew it\u2014erupted inside of her with the force of a volcano. Right after he thought Ahhhh, he thought Oh, Fuck. Way to go, genius.</p><p>She collapsed into his arms and he held her, stroking her back as she calmed. As he calmed. As they caught their collective breath. Finally he said, \u201cThat could have been a huge mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-oh,\u201d she said. \u201cOh-oh. Now what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I sure as hell can\u2019t reel it back in,\u201d he told her. \u201cIf I\u2019d known that was going to happen...Liz, I have a condom, for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t know we were going to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know, either.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She dropped her head to his shoulder and cried. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry. Okay, baby, take it easy. Can\u2019t do anything about it now. Shhhh.\u201d He held her and she rested against him, close in his arms. He kissed her cheeks and lips until her tears stopped. Then he took her open mouth again. God, her mouth was hot. And after a little while, as he held her, he began to grow firm again, and he was still there, inside. Without meaning to, without planning to, he began to pump his hips up and down again, driving himself into her. And she pushed into his lap. What the hell\u2014the damage was done, he thought. And he said, \u201cCan\u2019t do anything about it now...\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>T here were no patients in the morning and Mel took the opportunity to drive over to Clear River for gas, there being no service station in Virgin River. She took the pager with her so that Doc could call her back if something happened, but hardly anything ever happened.</p><p>Every time she went to one of the little surrounding towns she looked in particular at the women, wondering where Jack might have gone once in a while for \u201csomething a little basic.\u201d It didn\u2019t take her long to realize that he probably had his pick, and that there were plenty of attractive women around these towns.</p><p>She thought she might like to get something like a salt lick or some kind of feed for the edge of her property to draw the deer, so went to the very small strip mall on the main drag. As she passed the hardware store, she saw a window display of shears mounted on pegboard. They ranged in size from tiny scissors to clippers with six-inch, thick, curved blades. She stared at them, frowning, for a long time.</p><p>\u201cHelp you?\u201d a young woman in a green store apron asked.</p><p>\u201cHmm. What do you do with those?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cRoses,\u201d she said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cRoses? I haven\u2019t seen that many roses around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re not looking hard enough,\u201d she said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Well, I\u2019m looking for something that would draw deer,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cLike a doe call? But hunting season is months away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I wouldn\u2019t shoot at them! I like seeing them in my yard in the early morning. Can you tell me where to find that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, if you want deer in your yard, you\u2019re the only one. Just plant some lettuce or a couple of apple trees. With deer, if you don\u2019t want them in your produce, you can hardly keep them away.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh. If I throw some lettuce out there, will that work? Because I don\u2019t garden.\u201d</p><p>The woman tilted her head and smiled with eyes that frowned. \u201cWhere you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLos Angeles. Concrete jungle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp in Virgin River. Kind of back in the woods, you know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, don\u2019t try the lettuce, okay. Because there are also bear. Just keep your food indoors and don\u2019t press your luck. If you get deer, you get deer.\u201d Then she looked down and said, \u201cNice boots. Where can I get a pair like that?\u201d</p> <p>Mel thought a second, then said, \u201cCan\u2019t really remember. Target, I think.\u201d</p><p>Rather than going back to Doc\u2019s, she drove out to the river. She saw that there were six anglers in the river, and that one of them was Jack. She pulled up, parked, and got out to lean against the front of her car to watch. He looked over his shoulder at her, smiled a hello, but went back to his sport. He\u2019d pull out some line and let it slack, then gracefully cast out, the line reaching behind him in a large S before sailing smoothly out over the river, touching down on the top of the water as lightly as a leaf floating lazily down from a tree. And again, and again.</p><p>She loved to watch the arc of the lines, the whir of them going out, the clicking of them reeling in. They seemed almost synchronized, choreographed, the air above the water filled with flying lines. The men, in waders and vests, would walk around the swirling shallow waters while fish jumped now and then in the river. If there was a catch, the fish would either be released or go in the creel dangling from a shoulder strap.</p><p>After a peaceful interlude, Jack came out of the river with his rod and reel in hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust watching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not very hard\u2014let\u2019s see if I can scrounge some boots or waders.\u201d He went to his truck and dug around in the back. He came up with some huge rubber hip boots.</p><p>\u201cThis\u2019ll keep you dry\u2014but you won\u2019t be able to wade too far out.\u201d</p><p>She stepped into them. His legs were so much longer than hers that he had to fold them down twice at the top of her thighs, not an unpleasant sensation. They were so big that she had to shuffle rather than walk, dragging them along. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to run for my life, either,\u201d she said. \u201cOkay, what do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all in the wrist,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about aim so much as a nice clean arc and a little distance\u2014getting you into the deeper part of the river where the fish are more plentiful.\u201d He took her hand, led her to the water\u2019s edge, and showed her his casting.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t snap it hard, just roll it off nice and easy. Give it a little arm, but don\u2019t throw your body into it.\u201d</p><p>He handed her the rod, showed her where to unlock the reel. She gave it a try and the fly plunked down right in front of her. \u201cHow\u2019s that for distance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work on that,\u201d he said. He stepped behind her and guiding her hand, helped her cast. Twenty-five feet, maybe. Probably a fourth of the distance he could achieve, and her fly came down hard, making a splash. \u201cHmm, better,\u201d he said. \u201cReel her in, slowly.\u201d</p><p>She brought it back and repeated the process, this time without his hand guiding hers.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cWatch your footing\u2014there are spots where you can drop, trip, slip off a rock. You wouldn\u2019t want to fall in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to,\u201d she said, casting again. That time she flicked her wrist too hard and the hook flew back behind them, whooshing past their heads. \u201cOops,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, but be careful. I\u2019d hate to have that thing pulled out of the back of my head. Here,\u201d he said. He stood behind her and put a hand on her hip. \u201cDon\u2019t throw your body into it\u2014just use your arm and wrist\u2014and go easy. You\u2019ll get the distance. Eventually.\u201d</p><p>She did it again, and it was good. A nice, graceful arc, a respectable distance into the river. A fish jumped out where her fly had landed. \u201cOh, he\u2019s a big one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrown trout\u2014a beauty. You get him today and you\u2019ll show up all of us.\u201d</p><p>Something slithered past her feet and she jumped with a gasp. \u201cLamprey eel,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThey like to suck the roe and fluids out of the salmon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEw. Charming.\u201d She cast again. And again. This was fun. Now and then Jack would take her wrist and cast with her, reminding her of the wrist action. The other hand stayed on her hip, holding her still. \u201cI like this,\u201d she said. Then she had a hit and reeled in a fish. It wasn\u2019t a very big fish, but it was a fish. And she\u2019d caught him by herself.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d he said. \u201cTake it off the hook carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you, but then you have to do it. If you\u2019re going to fish, you\u2019re going to take the fish off the hook. Like this,\u201d he demonstrated, sliding his hand from the fish\u2019s head to his wriggling body, holding it firmly, disengaging the hook cautiously. \u201cHis mouth is okay. We\u2019re going to let him grow into a civilized meal,\u201d he said, tossing the fish back.</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou got lucky. Come on,\u201d he said, turning her back to the river. He stood behind her, holding her body straight and still with that large hand on her hip, his other hand guiding her wrist. She cast again, reeled in again.</p><p>\u201cJack, are there an awful lot of roses around here in summer?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHmm? I don\u2019t know. Sure, some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped by the hardware store this morning and they had this huge display of rose clippers. All sizes. I guess I\u2019ve never noticed anything like that before...\u201d</p><p>When she brought in her line, he turned her around slightly. He frowned. \u201cRose clippers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. From little tiny ones to great big ones with curved blades and leather grips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClear River. I went over for gas and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel, those aren\u2019t rose clippers. Well, I guess you could use \u2019em for that. More likely, they\u2019re for marijuana harvests. Little ones for manicuring buds, big ones for cutting down plants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw. Come on.\u201d</p><p>He turned her back toward the river. \u201cThere are towns around here that stock a lot of the stuff illegal growers need. Clear River\u2019s one. What were you doing at the hardware store?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d pick up something that would invite the deer to my yard, like a salt lick or feed or something, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned her back to face him again. \u201cSalt lick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, cows like that, right? So I thought...\u201d</p><p>He was shaking his head. \u201cMel, listen\u2014don\u2019t do anything to invite wildlife to your yard. You might get some unfriend-lies. Okay? Like maybe a buck who\u2019s more interested in rutting than having his picture taken. Or a bear. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRutting?\u201d she frowned.</p><p>He smiled patiently and touched the end of her nose. \u201cMaking love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sure. Okay,\u201d she said, turning back to the river. Casting again.</p><p>\u201cRose clippers.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI think you\u2019re getting the hang of this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI like it. I\u2019m not sure about that getting the fish off the hook part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, don\u2019t be a sissy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to catch one first,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou just watch. I\u2019m precocious.\u201d</p><p>Mel lost all track of time as she worked the rod, sending the colorful fly out across the water, bringing it back slowly. Again and again she cast, noting, too, that Jack kept his hand on her hip and now and then ran his other hand down her arm to her hand to guide her. \u201cCome on,\u201d she kept telling the fly. \u201cI\u2019m ready!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep your voice down,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThis is a peaceful sport.\u201d</p><p>Again and again she would cast her line. She wasn\u2019t skilled by any means, but she was getting it out there, and doing so prettily. At least, she thought so. She felt that hand that had been on her hip slide stealthily around her, holding her at her waist, pulling her just slightly back against him. \u201cYou\u2019re distracting me,\u201d she said, casting again.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, lowering his lips to her head, inhaling.</p><p>\u201cJack, there are people!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey could care less,\u201d he said, holding her against him.</p><p>She looked around and saw that what he said was true\u2014the other fishermen didn\u2019t even glance their way. Their lines were flying around in gentle, beautiful arcs. They didn\u2019t even look at each other. Okay, she thought. This feels good. I like the hand, the arm around me. I can manage this.</p><p>Then she felt his lips on her neck. \u201cJack! I\u2019m fishing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to bother you too much.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her just a little harder against him and began to nibble at her neck. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, laughter in her voice.</p><p>\u201cMel, please...Can\u2019t we go somewhere and just make out for a while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she laughed. \u201cI\u2019m fishing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I promise to take you fishing after...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Now behave yourself!\u201d But she was smiling because it was pretty heady having this big tough guy turn weak and desperate just from the taste of her neck. She concentrated on her casting while he concentrated on her neck, his arm tight around her waist. Ahhh...Nice. Very nice.</p><p>After a few more minutes passed, he let go of her with a tortured moan, walked back to his truck and laid himself over the front, arms outstretched wide, head lying on the hood. She looked over her shoulder at him and chuckled. Brought him to his knees, she thought. Big tough marine. Hah!</p><p>She treated herself to a few more casts, then turned and shuffled in those great big boots back to Jack. She leaned the rod against the truck and pulled her feet out of the rubber boots. He lifted his head and looked at her through narrowed eyes. \u201cThanks, Jack. I have to go. It\u2019s time for my soap.\u201d She treated him to a conciliatory peck on the cheek. \u201cMaybe we can do this again sometime.\u201d</p><p>As she drove back to town, she got to thinking\u2014a few weeks ago, she was absolutely certain there was nothing in her that allowed her to respond to a man. To Jack. Now she wasn\u2019t so sure. A little contact, a little kissing\u2014deep kissing\u2014it felt good. It made her forget sometimes that she had nothing to give. In fact, it made her wonder if maybe she was wrong about that. Going somewhere to make out for a while didn\u2019t sound like a bad idea. She was going to give that more thought. She poked her head into Doc\u2019s and found him on the computer and said, \u201cAnything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to the store. Need anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d he said again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She checked her watch, found herself hoping she hadn\u2019t missed the beginning. When she walked into the store, Joy stood in the curtained doorway and said, \u201cMel! Thank God!\u201d</p><p>The panicked look on her face sent Mel rushing to the back room. Leaning forward in the lawn chair, her hand gripping the front of her sweatshirt and breathing shallowly was Connie. Mel kneeled down. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cI can hardly breathe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoy, get me a bottle of aspirin. Pain?\u201d she asked Connie.</p><p>\u201cMy back,\u201d she said.</p><p>Mel put a hand between her shoulder blades. \u201cThere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>Joy handed her a brand-new aspirin bottle off the shelf and Mel ripped it open, shaking one out into her palm. \u201cSwallow this quickly.\u201d Connie did so and Mel asked,</p><p>\u201cPressure in the chest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Oh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>Mel got up, grabbed Joy\u2019s hand and pulled her out of the back room. \u201cRun for Doc. Tell him it might be her heart. Hurry.\u201d</p><p>Mel went back to Connie. She took her pulse and found it fast and irregular. She had grown clammy and her respirations were rapid and shallow. \u201cTry to relax and breathe slowly. Joy has gone for Doc.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p> <p>Mel noticed that Connie\u2019s left arm dangled at her side, probably in pain, while she gripped her shirt with her right hand and tried to pull it away from her body, as though to relieve the pressure in her chest. If Mel had speculated on a heart attack for one of these two women, she\u2019d have bet on Joy who was overweight and probably had high cholesterol. Not Connie who was petite and didn\u2019t even smoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Mel said. \u201cLet\u2019s wait for Doc. Don\u2019t talk, just stay calm. I\u2019m not going to let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>A tense couple of minutes passed before Joy, breathless, came flying through the door with Doc\u2019s medical bag and rushed to Mel\u2019s side. \u201cHere,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said try the nitro and get an IV started. He\u2019ll be right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d She dug around in the bag, found the nitro tablets and shook one out of the bottle. \u201cConnie, hold this under your tongue.\u201d</p><p>She did as she was told while Mel got the blood pressure cuff and stethoscope out of the bag. Connie\u2019s pressure was high, but within seconds some of the pain was easing. The nitro might be working. \u201cThat better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. My arm. I can hardly move my arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we\u2019ll take care of that.\u201d She snapped on a pair of gloves. She pulled the rubber strap around Connie\u2019s upper arm and started searching for a good vein, slapping her inner arm with two fingers. She tore open the package containing the IV needle and inserted it slowly. Blood eased up the clear tube and dripped on the floor. Mel then capped it off because she had no tubing or bag of fluid.</p><p>A moment later she heard a sound she didn\u2019t recognize and looked out of the back room to see old Doc wheeling a squeaky old gurney into the store. He left it in the store aisle and picked up a bag of Ringer\u2019s solution from its bed, handing it to Mel, while he toted a small portable oxygen canister. He put the cannula around Connie\u2019s neck and into her nostrils while he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019ve we got?\u201d</p> <p>As Mel hooked up the tubing to the needle and the Ringer\u2019s to the tube, she said,</p><p>\u201cElevated pressure, diaphoretic, chest, back and arm pain...I gave her an aspirin, and the nitro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. How\u2019s that pill working, Connie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. Put her on the gurney in the back of the truck, you beside her holding the Ringer\u2019s and monitoring her pressure, and if you think we have to stop for any reason, you bang on the window. The black bag goes with you\u2014you have oxygen, a portable defibrillator in the truck bed, and I want you to draw an eppie and atropine right away, to have ready.\u201d He went back to the gurney, pushed it into the very narrow space in the back room, and lowered it. He shook out and spread a large, heavy wool blanket over the sheet and said, \u201cOkay, Connie.\u201d</p><p>Managing the IV bag and tubing, Mel supported Connie under the arm so that she could be transferred from her chair to the lowered gurney. Doc lifted the back slightly so that she wouldn\u2019t be lying flat, then wrapped the blanket around her and strapped her in. He put the oxygen canister on the gurney between Connie\u2019s legs, then said to Mel, \u201cHave Joy hold up the bag of Ringer\u2019s while we get her out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we wait for an ambulance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the best idea,\u201d he said while together they lifted the gurney to its former upright position. As they rolled out of the store, Mel once again in control of the IV bag, Doc said, \u201cJoy, as soon as we get out of here I want you to call Valley Hospital and ask them to get a cardiologist to meet us in E.R. Tell Ron to meet us at Valley.\u201d Doc and Mel released the legs on the gurney and slid it in the back of the truck. Doc took off his heavy wool coat and draped it over Connie. As he would have headed for the driver\u2019s door of the truck, Mel grabbed his sleeve.</p><p>\u201cDoc, what the hell are we doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting her there as fast as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cIn you go. You\u2019re going to be cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll manage,\u201d she said, climbing into the truck bed beside Connie.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bounce out,\u201d Doc said. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to stop and pick you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust drive carefully,\u201d she said, already dreading those narrow, curving roads and sheer drops, squeaking by big logging trucks, not to mention the darkness and drop in temperature as they passed through the towering trees.</p><p>He jumped in, pretty spry for seventy, and put the truck in gear. He made a wide turn in the street, Mel in the back of the truck, holding the Ringer\u2019s above Connie\u2019s head because there was no IV stand on this old gurney. As they drove out of town, Jack was just returning. But Mel\u2019s attention was focused on Connie. She balanced the bag of Ringer\u2019s on the gurney above Connie\u2019s head, and dug around in Doc\u2019s black bag for syringes and vials, drawing her drugs quickly despite the hectic driving and bouncing. She capped the syringes and took up the IV bag again. Just don\u2019t arrest, Mel kept thinking. Just to be safe, she used one hand to open the portable defibrillator case, having it handy to be switched on if necessary. It was the kind used on commercial airlines; rather than paddles, there were patches that adhered to the chest. Rather than bare Connie to the cold before it became necessary, she decided not to attach the patches to her chest. Then, with one hand over her head, she leaned her body close across Connie\u2019s to keep her warm.</p><p>She had to give Doc a lot of credit for fancy driving. He managed to move down the mountain at a pretty fast clip, braking suddenly for the sharp curves and picking up speed for the straightaways while avoiding potholes and bumps. Mel was freezing, but Connie was taking steady breaths and her pulse was even and slower, when from the sheer fright and the ride in the back of the truck, it should probably be racing.</p><p>\u201cThat Doc,\u201d she said breathlessly into Mel\u2019s ear. \u201cHe sure is bossy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mel said. \u201cTry to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Mel had to switch the arm that held the Ringer\u2019s several times, she got so sore. And even when she stayed low in the bed of the truck, the wind was chilling her to the bone. May in the mountains, under the shade of huge, towering trees, was not warm. She tried to imagine doing this in winter, and she got colder. Her cheeks were numb, her fingers nearly without feeling.</p><p>After just over an hour ride, they pulled into a parking lot in front of a small hospital where two med techs and a nurse stood ready in the parking lot, waiting with their own gurney.</p><p>Doc jumped out of the truck. \u201cTake her on my gurney\u2014I\u2019ll get it later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d one said, pulling the gurney holding Connie out of the back of the truck.</p><p>\u201cShe have any meds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust an aspirin and a nitro tab. Ringer\u2019s TKO.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha,\u201d he said. \u201cEmergency staff standing by,\u201d and off they went, running with the gurney across the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Melinda,\u201d he said, moving a little more slowly now. Mel began to realize that waiting for emergency transport could have been a tragic mistake\u2014it could have turned that trip into three hours. As she waited with Doc in the emergency room, she learned that Valley Hospital was small but efficient, serving the needs of many small towns. They were capable of labor and delivery, C-sections when the infant and mother were not at major risk, X-rays, ultrasounds, some general surgeries, lab work and outpatient clinic, but if something as serious as emergency heart surgery or major surgery were required, a larger hospital was needed. It was a while before the doctor finally came out. \u201cWe\u2019re going to run an angiogram\u2014I think we\u2019re looking at blockages. She\u2019s stable for the moment, but they may be considering bypass surgery as soon as possible. We\u2019ll transport her by helicopter to Redding for that. Has her next of kin been notified?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should be here any minute. We\u2019ll wait for him here.\u201d</p><p>Within ten minutes, Connie was wheeled past them and down the hall. Another ten minutes brought Ron with Joy into the emergency room doors. \u201cWhere is she? Is she all right?\u201d Right behind them were Ricky and Liz, straight from school.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve taken her for an angiogram\u2014it\u2019s like an X-ray of blood vessels. Based on what that test tells them, they\u2019ll decide whether or not she needs surgery. Let\u2019s go to the cafeteria and get a cup of coffee and I\u2019ll try to explain it to you\u2014then we\u2019ll go see how they\u2019re doing on that test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Doc, thank you,\u201d Ron said. \u201cThank you for getting her help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t thank me,\u201d he said. \u201cThank Melinda. She saved Connie\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>Mel\u2019s head jerked toward him in surprise.</p><p>\u201cIt was her fast action\u2014that aspirin and calling for help\u2014not to mention her ride in the back of my pickup, that I believe allowed us to get her to the hospital so fast.\u201d</p><p>It was nine o\u2019clock before Mel and Doc got back to town, and of necessity they both headed for Jack\u2019s, more than a little grateful he had stayed open. And she knew he\u2019d stayed open for them. Doc asked for his whiskey and Mel said, \u201cI think I better have one, too. Maybe something a little smoother than that.\u201d</p><p>Jack poured her a Crown Royal. \u201cLong day?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShew,\u201d Doc said. \u201cWe spent most of it waiting for a decision. Connie\u2019s going to have bypass surgery in the morning. We waited around until they transported her to Redding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we just take her to Redding?\u201d Mel asked. Both men laughed. \u201cWhat? I looked at the map before I even came up here. It\u2019s just over a hundred miles of highway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about a hundred forty, Mel,\u201d Jack said. \u201cNarrow, two-lane, over the mountains. Would take about three hours to cross at best from Eureka. Probably closer to four. Coming from Virgin River\u2014five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>\u201cI think Ricky is taking Liz to her mother\u2019s for the night while Ron and Joy will make the long drive to Redding to spend the night at Connie\u2019s bedside. They\u2019re a little on the nervous side,\u201d Doc said.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI saw you flying out of town. I couldn\u2019t tell who you had in the back\u2014I just saw Mel hanging on for dear life.\u201d</p><p>Doc took a sip. \u201cShe came in kinda handy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done without a little help?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI probably would\u2019ve thrown Joy back there. But who knows if we\u2019d have gotten that far. You know how great one little aspirin is for a heart attack?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Mel took a sip of her drink and let her eyes slowly drift closed appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cConnie\u2019s going to be all right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, better than all right,\u201d Doc said. \u201cPeople go into that surgery a little gray around the gills and they give them nice fresh, clear arteries to float their oxygen through and they come out rosy cheeked and brand-new.\u201d</p><p>Mel took another sip. \u201cOh, God, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be warm again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to light the fire?\u201d Jack asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo, just let me drink this. Tell Doc I caught a fish today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d he said. \u201cWasn\u2019t much of a fish, but she caught it herself. Even if she couldn\u2019t take it off the hook without help.\u201d</p> <p>Doc peered at her over his specs and she lifted her chin a bit defiantly. \u201cCareful, Melinda,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could become one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot likely,\u201d she said. \u201cNot until you at least get a camper shell. We\u2019d have been better off in the back of my BMW.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have been better off,\u201d Doc said. \u201cThat piece of shit isn\u2019t big enough for a patient having a heart attack and a practitioner trying to keep her alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to fight with you for saying that,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause you at least called me a practitioner and not a nurse. You seem to be coming around, you old fart.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at Jack. \u201cWe keeping you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he said, chuckling. \u201cTake your time. In fact, I\u2019ll join you.\u201d He reached behind him and selected a bottle, tipping it over a glass. He lifted it in a toast to both of them.</p> <p>\u201cGood team work, amazingly. Glad everything\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Mel was exhausted, most of which came from the ride and long afternoon of tensely waiting at the hospital. Connie, she realized without much surprise, was more than a patient to her\u2014she was a friend. And when you do this kind of work in this kind of place, your patients are almost always your friends. Must be hard to maintain objectivity. On the other hand, success was that much more gratifying. Fulfilling. It wasn\u2019t like this in L.A.</p><p>Doc finished his whiskey and got up. \u201cNicely done, Melinda. We\u2019ll try to have a dull day tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Doc.\u201d</p><p>After the doctor left, Jack said, \u201cSounds like maybe the two of you have started to bond or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something,\u201d she said, sipping.</p><p>\u201cHow was that trip to Valley Hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Mr. Toad\u2019s wild ride,\u201d she said, making him laugh a little. She pushed her glass toward him and he gave her another splash of Crown.</p> <p>\u201cYou want ice or water with that?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is good. Very good, in fact.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her drink rather too quickly. She looked up at him, tilted her head to one side, then inclined it toward the glass.</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Because I think maybe that\u2019s enough. Your cheeks are flushed and I can tell, you\u2019re not cold anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a tish.\u201d</p><p>A tish was what she got\u2014a couple of swallows.</p><p>\u201cThanks for taking me fishing,\u201d she said. \u201cSorry you didn\u2019t get in my pants again.\u201d</p><p>A large surprised laugh escaped him. She was getting a little tiddly. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, Melinda. Whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAha! I knew it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike it\u2019s been hard to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so transparent.\u201d She downed the rest of her drink. \u201cI\u2019d better get going. I\u2019m completely shot.\u201d She stood up and nearly fell down. She grabbed at the bar to right herself and Jack came around to her side. He put an arm around her waist. She looked up at him with watery eyes and said, \u201cDamn. I forgot to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me make you some coffee,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cAnd ruin this perfectly good buzz? Hell, I\u2019ve earned it.\u201d She took a step and wavered. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll make me sober. Probably just wide-awake drunk.\u201d</p><p>Jack tightened his hold around her and laughed in spite of himself. \u201cAll right, Mel. I can put you in my bed and take the couch...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut sometimes I have deer in my yard in the morning,\u201d she said, a little whiny. \u201cI want to go home. They might come back.\u201d</p><p>Home. That sounded good to Jack, that she thought of that cabin as her home. \u201cAll right, Mel. I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a relief,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause I\u2019m pretty sure I already can\u2019t drive. Even on a straight and undangerous road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lightweight,\u201d he said.</p><p>They took a couple of steps and her legs buckled a second time. He gave a sigh and bent to lift her into his arms. She patted his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re strong,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re good to have around. It\u2019s like having my own personal valet.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled under his breath. Preacher had gone upstairs for the night so he turned off the Open sign and managed to get his keys out of his pocket without dropping her. He locked the front door and took her down the steps and around to the back of the bar where he kept his truck. He put her in and she managed, though with some difficulty, to buckle her seat belt. When he got in and started the truck she said, \u201cYou know something, Jack? You\u2019ve turned out to be my very good friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice, Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really appreciate this. Boy, whew. I\u2019m sure not much of a drinker. I think I\u2019m a one-beer girl. Two if I\u2019ve had a side of beef and an apple pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ve assessed the situation correctly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I ask for the good stuff again, be sure to ask me if I\u2019ve had food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure will,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laid her head back on the seat. Within five minutes, it lolled. And Jack spent the rest of the drive wondering a couple of things. One\u2014what if she roused enough as he was taking her inside to invite him to stay? That would be okay, wouldn\u2019t it? Even though she was just a \u201ctish\u201d disadvantaged? Or\u2014what if she didn\u2019t rouse and he just lay down beside her to be there in case she woke and decided it was time? That would be okay. Or maybe he could just wait on her couch, in case she needed anything...like sex. Then if she woke up during the night he\u2019d be there. He\u2019d be ready. He\u2019d been ready.</p><p>He played a dozen scenarios in his mind. He would carry her to her room and she would wake and say, \u201cStay with me tonight.\u201d He really didn\u2019t have the strength to say no. Or, she would wake and he would kiss her and then she would say, \u201cOkay.\u201d Or morning would come, he would already be there and she would say, \u201cNow, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Whoo boy. He was getting a little warm.</p><p>But she was still asleep when he pulled up in front of her cabin. He unbuckled her and lifted her out of the truck. He whacked her head on the door frame. \u201cOw!\u201d she yelled, her hand going to her head.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said. And thought to himself, foreplay that was not.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay.\u201d She laid her head back on his shoulder.</p><p>Now, he thought, I should stay to be sure she doesn\u2019t have a concussion. And that she doesn\u2019t need sex for it. Or just to be there in case she did...</p><p>He carried her across the porch, through the door to her room and, flipping on the light, laid her on the bed. Without opening her eyes she said, \u201cThank you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Melinda,\u201d he said. \u201cYour head okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s get your boots off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoots. Off.\u201d She lifted a leg, making him laugh. He pulled the boot off. The leg dropped and the other one came up. He pulled that one off and the leg dropped. Then she curled into a cute little package, pulling the quilt around her. He looked down at her and saw that it was lights out for Melinda. Then he saw the picture. Something hit him, and it didn\u2019t feel particularly good. He picked up the picture and looked at the man\u2019s face. So, you\u2019re the guy, he thought. He didn\u2019t look like a bad guy\u2014but clearly he had done something to Mel. Something she was having trouble getting beyond. Maybe he\u2019d left her for another woman\u2014but that seemed impossible to imagine. Maybe he left her for a man. Oh, please let it be so\u2014I can make that better\u2014just give me five minutes. Or maybe he looked harmless but had been an impossible asshole and she\u2019d broken off with him, but still loved him helplessly. And here she had his picture right there, to be the last face she saw before falling asleep at night.</p><p>At some point she was going to give Jack a chance to make that picture go away, but it wasn\u2019t going to be tonight. Probably just as well. If she woke to find him there, either in her bed or ready to be, she would put the blame on Crown Royal. He wanted it to come from desire\u2014and he wanted it to be real.</p><p>He scribbled a note. I\u2019ll be back for you at 8:00 a.m. Jack. He left it by the coffeepot. Then he went to his truck to get something he\u2019d purchased earlier in the day. He brought the leather case holding the dismantled fly fishing rod and reel and the waders into the house and left them by the front door. And went home. At 8:00 a.m. he was back in front of her cabin and what he saw made him smile. All the disappointing thoughts that had plagued him the night before vanished. She was sitting in her Adirondack chair in her new waders, idly casting her fly into the yard. A steaming cup of coffee rested on the wide chair arm beside her. He got out of the truck, grinning. \u201cYou found it,\u201d he said, walking to the porch.</p><p>\u201cI love it! Did you get this for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we go fishing, I need to stand beside you. Not in back of you, smelling your hair and feeling you against me. You need your own stuff. How do they fit?\u201d</p><p>She stood up and turned around for him. \u201cPerfect. I\u2019ve been practicing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting any better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. I\u2019m sorry about last night, Jack. I had been tense and hungry and freezing all day and it really hit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should keep this in my trunk, huh? In case we have a light day at Doc\u2019s and can just sneak off and fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea, Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me put my gear away,\u201d she said happily.</p><p>And he thought\u2014just give me time. I\u2019m going to get that picture put in storage. Ricky hadn\u2019t been around the bar the week right after Connie\u2019s heart attack, hanging close to the family in case they needed him for anything. When he did come into the bar, it was late and there were only two men at a table and Preacher behind the bar. Ricky sat up at the bar, his eyes downcast.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s everybody doing?\u201d Preacher asked.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cConnie\u2019s doing pretty good I guess. They sent Liz back to her mom\u2019s in Eureka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEureka isn\u2019t the end of the world, man. You can visit her.\u201d</p><p>Ricky looked down. \u201cYeah, but...probably shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was...she was the first girl I felt that way about.\u201d He looked up. \u201cYou know. That way.\u201d</p><p>The two men at the table stood and wandered out of the bar. \u201cClose call?\u201d Preacher asked him.</p><p>\u201cI wish. Holy God,\u201d Rick said, shaking his head. \u201cI thought I had it under control.\u201d</p><p>Preacher did something he\u2019d never done before. He drew a couple of cold drafts and put one in front of Rick, one in front of himself. \u201cTough call, that control thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. This for me?\u201d</p><p>Preacher lifted an eyebrow. \u201cI thought maybe you might need it right about now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he said, lifting the glass. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look like a kid, but she\u2019s just a kid. She\u2019s way too young.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWay,\u201d Preacher agreed. \u201cYou got a handle on it now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cNow that it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWelcome to the world.\u201d Preacher drank half his draft.</p><p>Rick just looked into his. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019d die if anyone got hurt, you know.

Try to think ahead next time, if you get my drift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do now.\u201d</p><p>Jack came into the bar from the back.

And wishes a little bit he hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstead of giving me a handful of rubbers, you should\u2019ve had me laminated,\u201d he said to Jack.</p><p>\u201cOh, boy. You gonna be okay, buddy?\u201d Jack asked. \u201cShe gonna be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. When am I gonna know? How am I gonna know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA month,\u201d Jack said. \u201cMaybe less. Depends on her cycle. You\u2019re going to have to ask her, Rick. If she got her period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna die,\u201d Ricky said miserably.</p><p>\u201cOkay then. Let\u2019s toast to your continued good luck. Since you got, you know, lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now I gotta wonder why they call it that,\u201d Ricky said.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>T he grass grew tall in the pastures, the ewes fat with lambing imminent. The cows were ready to calve and Sondra Patterson was almost to term. Sondra was expecting her third child, and the first two had come to her quickly and easily, so she and Doc claimed. She had decided to have this one at home, as she had the first two. This would be the first home birth for Mel, and she looked forward to it with nervous delight.</p><p>May aged bright and sunny\u2014and brought with it a bunch of men in pickups and campers. There was a great deal of horn-honking at the bar in the afternoon and Mel looked out to see this gathering descend on Jack\u2019s. She watched as he came out on his porch and greeted them with bear hugs and shouts and whistles.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked Doc Mullins.</p> <p>\u201cHmm. I think it\u2019s another Semper Fi reunion. Jack\u2019s old buddies from the Marine Corps. They come up here to hunt, fish, play poker, drink and yell into the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? He never mentioned that.\u201d And, she thought, is this my cue to be scarce?</p><p>Because that after-work beer, the occasional kiss, had become the best part of her day. She was further bewildered by the fact that he hadn\u2019t tried anything more. And yet, if he had, she would have worried about the consequences. She shouldn\u2019t be involved with anyone, even Jack. Not until she was sure she could handle it. Thing was, she just couldn\u2019t bring herself to give up that little bit of kissing. She was sure that Mark would understand. If their situations had been reversed, she told herself, she would. But with the marines in town, there would be none of that. Doc seemed to have no inclination to stay away, and at the end of the day he took himself over to the bar. \u201cComing?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...I don\u2019t want to distract anyone from their reunion...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry about that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole town looks forward to seeing these boys.\u201d</p><p>She went with him and found that of course Doc was greeted by these visiting men as if they were old friends. Jack dropped a possessive arm around Mel\u2019s shoulders and said, \u201cBoys, meet Mel Monroe, new nurse midwife in town. She\u2019s been working with Doc. Mel, meet Zeke, Mike Valenzuela, Cornhusker\u2014Corny for short, Josh Phillips, Joe Benson, Tom Stephens and Paul Haggerty. There will be a test later\u2014no name tags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc, you are a fine and smart gentleman,\u201d Zeke said, grinning, reaching for her hand, obviously under the impression Doc had hired her rather than resisted her.</p><p>\u201cMiss Monroe, it\u2019s an honor. An honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Mel,\u201d she said.</p><p>The noise with which they descended on her was invigorating. The next surprise for her, and perhaps it shouldn\u2019t have been, was that Preacher was one of them. And of course they drew Rick in as though he were a younger brother. Mel learned that Preacher had served under Jack when he was just a kid of eighteen in the first conflict in Iraq\u2014Desert Storm\u2014it turned out he was much younger than he looked. During that same time a cop from L.A. by the name of Mike Valenzuela and a builder from Oregon by the name of Paul Haggerty also served with them, but the two latter marines, being reservists, were called up for the latest Iraq conflict, again with Preacher and Jack, who were still on active duty at that time. The others, all reservists, were called up for Iraq where they were united in Baghdad and Fallujah. Zeke was a fireman from Fresno; Josh Phillips, a paramedic, and Tom Stephens, a news helicopter pilot\u2014were both from the Reno area. Joe Benson was an architect from the same Oregon town as Paul Haggerty\u2014Paul often built Joe\u2019s houses. And Corny, another firefighter, came the farthest, from Washington state, but he was born and raised in Nebraska, thus the nickname.</p><p>Jack was older than these men by four years or more, the next oldest in the crowd being Mike at thirty-six. Four of them were married with kids\u2014Zeke, Josh, Tom and Corny. Mel was fascinated by the way they talked about their women with lusty smiles and glittering eyes. No jokes about the old ball and chain here. Rather, they sounded as though they couldn\u2019t wait to get home to them.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Patti doing?\u201d someone asked Josh.</p><p>He curved his hands over his flat belly to indicate a pregnant tummy and grinning boastfully, said, \u201cShe\u2019s ripe as a tomato. I can hardly keep my hands off her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s ripe as a tomato, I bet you get slapped down like crazy,\u201d Zeke laughed. \u201cI got another one on Christa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way! I thought she said you were through!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said that two kids ago\u2014but I snuck one more by her. She\u2019s cooking number four. What can I say\u2014that girl\u2019s been lightin\u2019 my fire since high school. You should see her, man. She\u2019s lit up like a beacon. Nobody cooks \u2019em like Christa. Whew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy, congratulations, man! But I don\u2019t think you know when to quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t quit. But Christa says she\u2019s all done with me. She said after this one, snip snip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can go one more,\u201d Corny said. \u201cGot my girls. I feel a boy coming on.\u201d</p><p>No one could better appreciate this kind of enthusiasm for pregnant women than a midwife. Mel was loving it. Loving them.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard that a lot,\u201d Jack said. \u201cEight nieces later, no one got their boy. My brothers-in-law have run through all their chances, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re packin\u2019 a boy, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even kid myself about that,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>Jack was among the five single men with Preacher, Mike, Paul and Joe. Confirmed bachelors, Mel was warned. They loved women, but couldn\u2019t be caught. \u201cExcept Mike,\u201d Zeke said. \u201cHe gets caught regular.\u201d Mel learned that Mike was twice divorced and had a girlfriend back in L.A. who was trying to be wife number three. The camaraderie was engaging, electrifying. These guys were tight, it was real easy to see. Mel didn\u2019t exactly rush away\u2014she had fun. Other folks from town who frequented the bar seemed, like Doc, to be acquainted with this band of brothers and dropped in to partake of the reunion, every bit as welcoming of them as Jack and Preacher had been.</p><p>As she left that evening, Jack broke away from his buddies to walk her to her car.</p><p>\u201cOh, now there will be talk,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s already talk, but around here, what do you expect? Listen, Mel, you shouldn\u2019t stay away on account of them\u2014they\u2019re a good bunch of guys. But let me tell you what the agenda will be. There will be lots of beer and poker, fishing all day. They\u2019ll stay in their campers, make too much noise, and fill the place up with cigar smoke. Preacher will have something on the stove everyday. And I sense a lot of fish coming our way. Preacher\u2019s got a stuffed trout that will knock you down, it\u2019s so good.\u201d</p><p>She put a hand against his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Jack. You just enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to ignore me for five days, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come by after work for a beer, but you know I like my cabin, my peace and quiet. Have fun. That\u2019s the important thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese are great guys,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have a feeling they\u2019re going to get in the way of my love life.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cYour love life is pretty bleak, as a matter of fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I keep trying to spool it up. And now them,\u201d he said, giving his head a jerk in the direction of his bar, which seemed to be throbbing from the noise and laughter within. He put his hands on her waist. \u201cKiss me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Haven\u2019t I been perfect? Haven\u2019t I followed all your rules? How can you be so selfish? There\u2019s no one around\u2014they\u2019re busy drinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should go back to your reunion,\u201d she said, but she laughed at him again. Boldly, he picked her up under her arms and lifted her high, holding her above him, slowly lowering her mouth to his. \u201cYou\u2019re shameless,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he begged. \u201cCome on. Gimme a little taste.\u201d</p><p>It was simply irresistible. He was irresistible. She grabbed his head in her hands and met his lips. She opened hers, moving over his mouth. When he did this to her, she thought of nothing but the kiss. It consumed her deliciously. She allowed his tongue, he allowed hers, and she reached that moment when she wanted it to never end. It was so easy to become lost in his tenderness, his strength.</p><p>And then, inevitably, it had to end. They were standing in the street, after all, though it was almost dark. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said. He put her on her feet and behind them, a raucous cheer erupted. There, on the porch at Jack\u2019s, stood eight marines and Rick, their tankards raised, shouting, cheering, whistling, cat-calling.</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this some kind of marine tradition?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill them,\u201d he said again, but he kept his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou realize what this means,\u201d she said. \u201cThese little kisses are no longer our little secret.\u201d</p><p>He looked down into her eyes. The shouts had subsided into a low rumble of laughter.</p><p>\u201cMel, they are not little. And since it\u2019s leaked,\u201d he said, grabbing her up in his arms, lifting her up to him again, her feet clear of the ground, and planted another one on her, to the excited shouts of the old 192nd. Even with that riot in the background, she found herself responding. She was growing addicted to the perfect flavor of his mouth.</p><p>When it was done she said, \u201cI knew it was a mistake to let you get to first base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah, I haven\u2019t even thrown out the first pitch yet. You\u2019re invited to go fishing with us, if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I have things to do. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow night for a beer. And I\u2019ll get myself to my car. I\u2019m not going to make out in front of them for the next week.\u201d</p><p>A little local research revealed to Mel that there was an ultrasound machine in Grace Valley, about thirty minutes away in northern Mendocino county. She had a long chat with one of the town doctors, June Hudson, and they worked out a deal for the use of the ultrasound\u2014the deal was that June would provide this service out of the goodness of her heart. \u201cThe ultrasound was donated,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen from at least a half dozen surrounding towns make use of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Mel arranged to bring Sondra in for a screening that day but Sondra insisted on baking six dozen cookies that she would leave at the Grace Valley clinic. \u201cAre you sure your husband can\u2019t come along? It\u2019s really something to see,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cIt would have to be him and the kids,\u201d Sondra said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really looking forward to getting away for a few hours.\u201d</p> <p>The two of them set out for Grace Valley, driving down through the foothills and along back roads that led them past farms, pastures, vineyards, ranches, flower fields and through a few towns that were not even specs on a map. Sondra, having lived in this part of the country all her life, was able to give Mel a running commentary on where they were, whose ranch was whose, what kind of crops were being grown\u2014</p><p>mostly alfalfa and silage for the cattle\u2014orchards of fruit and nuts, and the inevitable lumber harvesting. It was a gorgeous day, a beautiful drive, and when they entered the town, Mel was instantly impressed by the shiny clean appearance of the place.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of brand-new,\u201d Sondra said. \u201cA flood nearly wiped them out not long ago and they did a lot of rebuilding and painting. You can still see the high water marks on some of the big old trees.\u201d</p><p>There was a caf\u00e9, a service station, a big church, the clinic, and lots of well-kept little houses. Mel pulled up to the clinic and got out. Inside she was immediately faced with Dr. Hudson, a trim woman in her late thirties, dressed much like Mel. She was clad in jeans and boots, chambray shirt with a stethoscope around her neck. She smiled and stuck out her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pleasure, Ms. Monroe,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m delighted you\u2019re working with Doc Mullins\u2014he\u2019s due a little assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, call me Mel. You know the doctor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Everybody knows everybody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been in Grace Valley?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>June laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve been here all my life. Except for medical school.\u201d June stuck her hand out toward Sondra. \u201cThis must be Mrs. Patterson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve brought you cookies,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really generous of you to do this for me. I never had one with the other two kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very convenient precaution,\u201d June said, gladly taking the box of cookies. She opened it up, inhaled deeply and said, \u201cOh, these are sinful looking.\u201d Then looking back at Sondra and Mel she said, \u201cIf you knew how many people from the neighboring towns helped us rebuild after the flood, then you\u2019d know generosity. Come on, let\u2019s see what we\u2019ve got. Then if you have time, we can go grab a bite to eat at the caf\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Over the course of the next hour, they determined that Sondra would give birth to a baby boy, the baby was already in position and there was nothing to indicate there would be complications. They met Dr. Stone, a drop-dead gorgeous blond man June referred to as a city-boy transplant. At the caf\u00e9, they met June\u2019s father, the town doctor before her, and he asked after Old Mullins, who couldn\u2019t be any older than Doc Hudson. \u201cHe still as ornery as ever?\u201d Doc Hudson wanted to know.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m softening him up,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s your story?\u201d June asked over lunch. \u201cHow long have you been in Virgin River?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a couple of months. I came up here from L.A., looking for a change, but I admit, I wasn\u2019t prepared for country medicine. I took all of our resources and hospital technology for granted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you like it so far?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has its challenges. There are aspects of rural living that I think might be growing on me,\u201d Mel said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure how long it\u2019s going to work out for me. My sister is in Colorado Springs, married with three children, and she really wants Aunt Mel nearby.\u201d She took a bite of a delicious hamburger and said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to completely miss out on her kids\u2019 childhoods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t say that,\u201d Sondra said.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry,\u201d she said, patting her hand. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere before you deliver, which from the look of things is going to be real soon.\u201d She laughed and added, \u201cI just hope we don\u2019t have to pull off to the side of the road on our way home today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll stay on,\u201d June said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to have you so close by.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cClose by? It took us over a half hour of twisting, turning and inching past logging trucks, just to go one way! And I bet it\u2019s not twenty miles!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d June said. \u201cIt\u2019s just over fifteen miles. Isn\u2019t it great that we\u2019re neighbors?\u201d</p><p>Before they were done with lunch a man came into the caf\u00e9 carrying a baby. He reminded Mel just slightly of Jack\u2014equal in height, muscled, rugged-looking in his jeans and plaid shirt, fortyish, and handling a baby with ease. He bent, gave Dr. Hudson a kiss on the cheek and handed over the baby. \u201cMeet Jim, my house husband. And our son, Jamie.\u201d</p><p>All the way back to Virgin River Mel was thinking, I didn\u2019t feel so out of place today. She loved June and John Stone. Even old Doc Hudson was a kick. After she dropped Sondra off at her farm and drove back into town, it seemed as though the town was cuter somehow. Not quite the falling-down little burg she\u2019d first thought. It seemed oddly like home.</p><p>She pulled up in front of Doc\u2019s house and noticed as she did so that the men were just getting back to Jack\u2019s from fishing all day. She went into the house to find Doc in the kitchen assembling something at the kitchen table. It looked as though he\u2019d gotten himself a new bag. \u201cDoc Hudson sends his regards, as do June and John. What are you up to?\u201d</p><p>He put a couple of things in the bag and pushed it toward her. \u201cTime you had one of your own,\u201d he said.</p><p>It was fun to watch the marines load up their gear and head for the river in the early morning. Mel waved to them from her spot on Doc\u2019s front steps where she took her morning coffee, and though they\u2019d been up half the night playing poker and drinking, they seemed full of energy and enthusiasm. They\u2019d shout and wave, and whistle at her. Flirt. \u201cOh, baby, you are so beautiful in the morning,\u201d Corny yelled across the street. His reward was a playful whap on the back of the head from Jack. They were barely gone when a large, dark SUV pulled into town, driving slowly down the street. To Mel\u2019s surprise, the driver stopped in front of Doc\u2019s. The door opened, but the engine continued to run. A man got out and stood in the street next to the open door, half-hidden. He was a tall guy, broad-shouldered. He wore a black ball cap and his hair curled out beneath it. \u201cThis doctor make house calls?\u201d he asked. Mel stood up. \u201cSomeone\u2019s sick?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cSomeone\u2019s pregnant,\u201d he answered.</p><p>She felt a smile reach her lips. \u201cWe can make house calls, if necessary. But it\u2019s a lot more convenient to do prenatal checks here in the clinic. We see well patients on Wednesdays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou Doc Mullins?\u201d he asked, his eyes crinkling doubtfully.</p><p>\u201cMel Monroe,\u201d she said with a chuckle. \u201cFamily nurse practitioner and midwife. Doc hasn\u2019t been doing much women\u2019s health since I got here. Where does your wife plan to have the baby?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s up in the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, where do you live?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head. \u201cShe\u2019s on the other side of Clear River. Almost an hour from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a hospital room here. Is it a first baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, yeah.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first one I\u2019ve been around for,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s not my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI made an assumption. Bring the lady in for a prenatal checkup,\u201d</p><p>Mel said. \u201cI can show her our room and talk to her about her options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about if she has it at home?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s an option, too,\u201d Mel said. \u201cBut really, Mr....?\u201d The man didn\u2019t respond as he should, with his name. He just stood there, big in his denim jacket, tall in his boots. Serious. \u201cReally, the person having the baby needs to be involved in the discussion. Want to make an appointment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks.\u201d And he got in the SUV and proceeded out of town. She found herself chuckling; she\u2019d never had a consultation go quite like that. She hoped the man would confer with the pregnant woman about where she\u2019d like to give birth.</p><p>The marines left at the end of the week and the town quieted down, but after getting to know them, she was actually sorry to see them go. While the boys were in town, Preacher was a lot more animated, laughing easily, scowling so much less. And each one of them grabbed her and hugged her goodbye, like she was part of their family. Mel found herself looking forward to having Jack to herself again, but it was not to be. Jack was oddly morose and somewhat distant. He didn\u2019t lift her off the ground or pester her for kisses, and for someone who had resisted and complained of the inadvisability of same, she was disappointed. Bereft. When she questioned his strange mood, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mel. I think the boys wore me out.\u201d</p><p>When she went to the bar for lunch, Preacher reported that Jack was fishing.</p><p>\u201cFishing?\u201d she said. \u201cDidn\u2019t he get enough of that last week?\u201d To which Preacher merely shrugged.</p><p>Preacher didn\u2019t seem particularly worn out. He presided over the bar with the help of Ricky, polishing glasses, serving food, bussing tables and partaking of the occasional game of cribbage. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with Jack?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cMarines. They take their toll,\u201d he replied.</p><p>Four days later, a week ahead of schedule, Mel got the call from the Patterson farm that it was time. Given the fact that Sondra reported easy, quick births and had already been experiencing contractions through the night, Mel went immediately. Babies are odd\u2014they do as they please. Having a history of short labors didn\u2019t necessarily mean they would all be that way. With the support of her mother, motherin-law and husband, Sondra labored hard through the day. Finally in the early evening, the little boy arrived. He didn\u2019t emerge with a lusty cry and Mel had to suction, stroke and cajole him into the world. Sondra bled a little too much and the baby wasn\u2019t interested in nursing right away. Even Sondra quickly knew the difference between this and her previous two experiences.</p><p>Getting a slower than usual start in the world doesn\u2019t necessarily mean trouble, and the baby\u2019s heart, respirations, coloring and cry caught up right away. Still, Mel stayed a bit longer than she ordinarily might have. She rocked the baby for three hours past the time she felt everything was fine, playing it extra safe. It was ten at night by the time Mel finally decided to give them back their lives, their family, that it was perfectly safe to leave them. \u201cAnd I\u2019m wearing my pager,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t hesitate, if you think anything is amiss.\u201d</p><p>Instead of going right back to her cabin, she went into town. If Jack\u2019s was dark and closed up, she\u2019d go home. But the light was on in the bar, though the Open sign was not lit.</p><p>When she pushed open the door, she was greeted by a most unexpected sight. Preacher was behind the bar, a steaming cup of coffee in front of him, but Jack sat at a table with his head down on his arms. In front of him was a bottle of Scotch and a shot glass.</p><p>When Preacher saw her enter, he said, \u201cThrow the latch on that door, Mel. I think this is enough company.\u201d</p><p>She did so, but the look on her face was completely non-plussed. She walked over to Jack and put a hand on his back. \u201cJack?\u201d she asked. His eyes briefly opened and then rolled back in their sockets and closed again. His head lolled and one arm fell off the table and dangled at his side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Mel went to the bar, hopped up on a stool in front of Preacher and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d Preacher shrugged and made a move to reach for his coffee mug, but before he could connect with it, Mel virtually lunged across the bar, grabbed the front of his shirt in her fist and said, hotly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?!\u201d</p><p>Preacher\u2019s black brows shot up in surprise and he put up his hands as if being arrested. Mel slowly let go of his shirt and sat back on the stool. \u201cHe\u2019s drunk,\u201d</p> <p>Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cWell, no kidding. But there\u2019s something wrong with him. He\u2019s been different all week.\u201d</p><p>Again the shrug. \u201cSometimes when the boys are here, it dredges things up. You know? I think he\u2019s having some remembering of things not so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarine things?\u201d she asked. Preacher nodded. \u201cCome on, Preacher. He\u2019s the best friend I have in this town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d like me talking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever this is, he shouldn\u2019t go through it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of him,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cHe\u2019ll snap out of it. He always does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she implored. \u201cCan\u2019t you guess how much he means to me? I want to help, if there\u2019s any way I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could tell you some things, but they\u2019re very ugly things. Not for a lady to hear.\u201d</p><p>She laughed a little. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the things I\u2019ve seen, much less heard. I worked in a trauma center for almost ten years. It could get pretty ugly at times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>Preacher took a deep breath. \u201cThose boys that come up every year? They come to make sure he\u2019s okay. He was their sergeant. My sergeant. Best sergeant in the marines. He\u2019s been in five combat zones. The last one, Iraq. He was leading a platoon into interior Fallujah and one of the boys stepped on a truck mine. Blew him in half. Right away we were pinned down by sniper fire. Our boy who stepped on the mine, he didn\u2019t die right away. Something about the heat of the explosion\u2014it must\u2019ve cauterized arteries and vessels and he didn\u2019t bleed out. Didn\u2019t have pain, either\u2014it must have done something to his spine. But he was fully conscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack ordered everyone to take cover in the buildings, which we did. But he sat with his man. He wouldn\u2019t leave him. Under sniper fire, leaning against a fat tire on an overturned truck, he held him and talked to him for a half hour before he died. Kid kept telling Jack to go, take cover, that it was okay. You know he didn\u2019t go. He\u2019d never leave one of his men behind.\u201d He took a drink of coffee. \u201cWe saw a lot of stuff back there that will give you nightmares, but that\u2019s the one that sometimes gets to him. I don\u2019t know what hits him harder\u2014the kid\u2019s slow death or the visit he paid his parents to tell them all the things he said before he went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he gets drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFishes a lot. Maybe goes into the woods and camps awhile to get his stability back. Sometimes he\u2019ll try to drink it away, but that\u2019s pretty rare. First, it doesn\u2019t work too well and second, he feels like crap afterward. But it\u2019ll be okay, Mel. He always comes out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess everyone has baggage. Gimme a beer.\u201d</p><p>He poured one from the tap and put it before her. \u201cSo maybe the thing to do is just let him be awhile.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs he going to wake up soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s tanked. I was just about to carry him to bed when you walked in. I\u2019ll sleep in the chair in his room, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case he\u2019s not just drunk. In case he gets sick or something. He carried me down a road in Iraq\u2014about a mile. I\u2019m not letting anything happen to him now.\u201d</p><p>She drank some of her beer. \u201cHe\u2019s carried me a little, too,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he knows it, though.\u201d</p><p>They sat in silence for a little while. She drank about half her beer. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get a picture of him carrying you,\u201d she said. \u201cMust\u2019ve looked like the ant and the rubber tree.\u201d</p><p>He surprised her with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d he get you to come here? To this little town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to talk me into it. I kept in touch with him when he got out, and when I got out, I came up. He said I could stay and help around the bar if I wanted to. I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>A noise behind her made her turn. Jack fell off the chair and crashed to the floor, sprawling there.</p><p>\u201cNightie-night time,\u201d Preacher said, coming around the bar.</p><p>\u201cPreacher, if you\u2019ll get him to his room, I\u2019ll stay with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that, Mel. Could be unpleasant. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve held many a bucket, if it comes to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes he cries out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes, so do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really do care about him, then?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI said so, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, okay. If you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>Preacher crouched and pulled Jack upright. Hands under his armpits, he got him to a limp standing position, then putting a shoulder to his midsection, hoisted him over his shoulder in a fireman\u2019s carry. Mel followed him to Jack\u2019s bedroom. She\u2019d never been in Jack\u2019s quarters. It was set up like a little efficiency apartment with two means of entry\u2014either through the kitchen behind the bar or the back door that led out to the yard. It was L-shaped, the bedroom being in the short end of the L</p><p>and the living area larger. There was a table with two chairs by the window and while there was no kitchen, there was a small refrigerator.</p><p>Preacher put Jack on the bed and unlaced and removed his boots. \u201cLet\u2019s get the jeans off,\u201d she said. To Preacher\u2019s dubious look, she said, \u201cI assure you, I\u2019ve seen it all.\u201d</p><p>She undid the leather belt and unsnapped the jeans. Mel took the right pant leg, Preacher took the left and they pulled, leaving him in his boxers. Mel unbuttoned his shirt and rolling him from side to side, removed it. She took the clothes to his closet. Hanging on a peg just inside the door was a holster with a handgun in it and it made her gasp. She hung the pants and shirt over the gun.</p><p>Preacher was staring down at Jack, clad only in boxers. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna kill me for this,\u201d</p><p>Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cOr thank you,\u201d she supplied, giving him a small smile. \u201cIf my pager goes off, I\u2019ll come for you.\u201d She pulled the comforter over Jack.</p><p>\u201cOr if you have any problems,\u201d the big man said.</p><p>When Preacher had gone, Mel pulled off her boots and in stocking feet, she poked around a little. He had a roomy bathroom with cupboards and drawers. She opened one and found that he kept underwear and socks in there. Towels were stored there, as well, and remembering that first day in Virgin River, she sniffed one. Downy, like he had said.</p><p>The closet was a medium-sized walk-in. There was a small laundry room with cabinets in addition to the washer and dryer. The bathroom and laundry room had doors that closed, but the bedroom was in full view of the living room. Looking around, it was so obviously Jack. Very masculine; very functional. He had a leather couch and big leather chair. There was a television on the facing wall and beside it, a glass-and-wood gun case filled with rifles, the key dangling from the lock. There was a heavy wood coffee table and a side table between the sofa and chair with a lamp on it. The walls were of rough-hewn wood and there were only two framed pictures on the side table. A family photo showing all of them, Jack, four sisters, four brothers-in-law, eight nieces, one silver-haired father as large as Jack. Beside it, a rather older portrait of his mother and father.</p><p>She picked up the family photo. This was a family of strong good looks, the men all tall and handsome, the women trim and pretty, the girls adorable\u2014the youngest just little, like three or four, the oldest a teen. She thought Jack the best looking of them all, and he stood in the middle of the group, an arm around a sister on each side. She took the throw off the couch, wrapped it around herself, and curled up in the large chair. Jack hadn\u2019t moved a muscle. Eventually she, too, nodded off. Somewhere in the night, sounds came from Jack\u2019s bed. He was fitful, rolling around, muttering in his sleep. Mel went to the bed, sat on the edge and touched his brow. He grumbled something unintelligible and curled toward her, grabbing her and pulling her into the bed. He rested his head against her. She took his head in the crook of her arm and lay down beside him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said to him. And he quieted at once, draping an arm over her.</p><p>She pulled the comforter over them both and snuggled up to him. She sniffed the pillow\u2014Downy. Who was this guy? she found herself asking. Looks like Paul Bunyan, runs a bar, has all these guns, and cleans and launders like Martha Stewart. In his sleep, he pulled her closer. His breath smelled of Scotch. Whew, she thought. She put her face against his hair, which smelled of his musk combined with the wind and trees. She inhaled deeply; she\u2019d already begun to love his particular scent and the taste of his mouth. She had wondered what was under the shirt\u2014a nice mat of brown hair on his chest and a couple of tattoos. On his upper left arm an eagle, globe and anchor, almost as big as her hand. On the upper right, over a ribbon, the words: SAEPE EXPERTUS,</p><p>SEMPER FIDELIS,</p><p>FRATRES AETERNI</p><p>She couldn\u2019t resist, she rubbed her hands over the mat of hair on his chest and over his smooth shoulders. She pulled him close. Within minutes, she had fallen back to sleep, cradling Jack in her arms, his arm comfortably embracing her. In the dim light of early morning, Jack awakened with a pounding head. He turned his face to the side and the first thing he saw were Mel\u2019s golden curls against the pillow next to him. She clutched the covers under her chin, sleeping soundly. He raised himself up on an elbow and looked down at her face. Her pink lips were parted in sleep; sooty lashes lay against her cheek. He lifted a soft curl off the pillow and held it to his face, inhaling. Then he leaned toward her and lowered his lips to gently touch hers.</p><p>Her eyes came open. \u201cMorning,\u201d she whispered sleepily.</p><p>\u201cDid we do it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said.</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we do it, I want to remember it. I don\u2019t even know why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped by the bar for a beer just about the time Preacher was scraping you off the floor. Headache?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt went away the minute I saw you. I must have had one too many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it work? Did you scare away all the demons?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt got you in my bed. If I\u2019d known it was that easy, I\u2019d have gotten plastered weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLift the covers, Jack,\u201d she said.</p><p>He did so. There he was, boxer clad and sporting quite a healthy morning erection. And there she was, fully clothed.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look down,\u201d he said, dropping the comforter. \u201cYou have me at a huge disadvantage.\u201d She laughed at him. \u201cWe could do it now,\u201d he suggested. He felt the texture of her hair between his thumb and finger. \u201cI\u2019ll treat you real, real good.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d she declined.</p><p>\u201cDid I try anything?\u201d he wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drank enough so that could have been really humiliating. Assault with a dead weapon.\u201d</p><p>She ran her fingers over the tattoo. \u201cI sort of expected this,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cRite of passage. I bet every young marine wakes up with a splitting head and a little remembrance of the Corps.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d she asked, running her fingers over the words on the other arm.</p><p>\u201cOften tested, always faithful, brothers forever.\u201d He touched her cheek. \u201cWhat did Preacher tell you?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>\u201cThat the boys come up here and stir up some of your roughest memories of the wars you\u2019ve been in. But, I suspect that now and then you\u2019d have those memories anyway, whether they came or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love those boys,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re devoted to you. So\u2014maybe it\u2019s worth a little discomfort now and then. Friendships like that don\u2019t come cheap.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>J ack was back to his old self. It was either the Scotch or the fact that he woke up to a pretty blonde in his bed. He bet on the blonde.</p> <p>He never did ask Preacher precisely what he had told Mel. And he didn\u2019t ask Mel to be more specific. It didn\u2019t really matter. What did matter was that he had bonded with Mel on a new level that night without planning to. That she knew he was tortured over something terrible from his past and instead of shying away, stayed with him, willing to take it on\u2014it had meant something. She had held him while he tossed and turned against a mean-spirited ghost. After that, she yielded more willingly to those kisses. He was definitely ready to move ahead with her.</p><p>They were the current talk in Virgin River, which gave Jack a strange satisfaction. For a man who didn\u2019t want to be tied down to a woman, a man who tended to keep his woman in the shadows, he found himself wanting everyone to know they were a couple. And he worried that she would make good on her threats to leave before he could convince her to stay forever.</p><p>Jack took Mel to the coast to whale watch and they talked all the way there and back, but on the high cliffs above the ocean, they held hands, quiet, while the great fleet of behemoth mammals swam by, jumping out of the water and landing with an enormous splash. Their own guard of dolphins escorted them to the north. She let him kiss her for a long time that day. Many times. Then if his hand wandered she said, \u201cNo. Not yet.\u201d And that gave him hope. Not yet meant it was on the agenda. He was completely smitten. Jack was forty and this was the first time that he had a woman in his life he couldn\u2019t imagine giving up.</p><p>Mel called her sister. \u201cJoey,\u201d she said quietly, in almost a whisper. \u201cI think I have a man in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou found a man in that place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I think so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you sound so...strange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to know something. Is it okay? Because I\u2019m not even close to being over Mark. I still love Mark more than anything. Anyone.\u201d</p><p>Joey let out her breath slowly. \u201cMel, it\u2019s all right to get on with your life. Maybe you\u2019ll never love anyone as much as you loved Mark\u2014but then maybe there will be someone else. Someone next. You don\u2019t have to compare them, honey, because Mark is gone and we can\u2019t get him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d she corrected. \u201cNot past tense. I still love Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Mel,\u201d Joey said. \u201cYou can go on living. You might as well have someone to pass the time with. Who is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man who owns the bar across from Doc\u2019s clinic\u2014the one who fixed up the cabin, bought me the fishing pole, got my phone installed. Jack. He\u2019s a good man, Joey. And he cares about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel...Have you...? Are you...?\u201d</p><p>There was no answer.</p> <p>\u201cMel? Are you sleeping with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I let him kiss me.\u201d</p><p>Joey laughed sadly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mel. Can you really think otherwise? Would Mark want you to wither away, lonely? Mark was one of the finest men I\u2019ve ever known\u2014</p><p>generous, kind, loving, genuine. He\u2019d want you to remember him sweetly, but to get on with your life and be happy.\u201d</p><p>Melinda started to cry. \u201cHe would,\u201d she said through her tears. \u201cBut what if I can\u2019t be happy with anyone except Mark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby sis, after what you\u2019ve been through, would you settle for some marginal happiness? And a few good kisses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it a go. Worst case\u2014it takes your mind off your loneliness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that wrong? To use someone to take your mind off your dead husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you put that another way? What if you enjoyed someone who took your mind off your dead husband? That could pass for happiness, couldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t be kissing him,\u201d she said. And she cried. \u201cBecause I just can\u2019t stay here. I don\u2019t belong here. I belong in L.A. with Mark.\u201d</p><p>Joey sighed heavily. \u201cIt\u2019s only kissing, Mel. Just take it one kiss at a time.\u201d</p><p>When they hung up the phone, Joey said to her husband Bill, \u201cI have to go to her. I think she might be heading for a crisis.\u201d</p><p>Mel had started thinking about the past more\u2014that morning that the police came to the door to tell her that Mark was dead. They had worked the swing shift together at the hospital the night before. They\u2019d taken their lunch hour together in the cafeteria. But Mark was on call and the E.R. was busy, so he stayed through the night. It happened when he was on his way home.</p><p>She had gone to the morgue to view him. Left alone with him for a little while, she took his cold, lifeless body into her arms, his chest riddled with three perfect holes, and wept until they dragged her away.</p><p>She had a video in her mind\u2014one that ran from the pictures of Mark lying on the floor at the convenience store, the police at her door at dawn, through the funeral, those nights that she cried literally through the entire night, right up to the long days of packing up his things and the long months of not being able to part with them. She saw the film in her head as if from above, curled into a fetal position in her bed, grabbing herself around the gut as though she\u2019d been run through by a knife, crying hard, loud tears. Cries so loud that she thought the neighbors would hear and call for help.</p><p>Rather than just telling his picture that she loved him, she began carrying on long, one-sided conversations with his flat, lifeless face. She would tell him everything she\u2019d done all day and it would inevitably end with, \u201cI still love you, damn you,\u201d she would exclaim harshly. And urgently, \u201cI still love you. I can\u2019t stop loving you and missing you and wanting you back.\u201d</p><p>Mel had always thought that Mark was the kind of lover, the kind of husband, who would find a way to contact her from beyond, because he was so devoted. But there had never been any evidence that he\u2019d crossed back. When he went, he went all the way. He was so gone, it left her feeling desolate inside.</p><p>She woke up crying three days running. Jack had asked her if anything was wrong, if there was anything she wanted to talk about. \u201cPMS,\u201d she told him. \u201cIt\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel, have I done anything?\u201d He wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Hormones. I swear.\u201d</p><p>But she was starting to think that the brief reprieve she seemed to have experienced lately was now officially over and she was on her way back to the darkness of grief and longing. Back to the stark loneliness.</p><p>Then something happened to jar her out of it. She returned from her short walk to the corner store to watch her soap with Joy and a recovering Connie to see a rented car in front of Doc\u2019s. When she went inside she was face-to-face with her sister\u2019s bright smile. Mel gasped, dropped her bag and they swooped together, lifting each other off the ground, laughing and crying at once. When the crazy moments had passed, still holding Joey\u2019s hand, Mel turned toward Doc to make a formal introduction. But before she could, Doc said, \u201cKind of scary, there being two of you.\u201d</p><p>Mel ran her hand over Joey\u2019s shiny and smooth brown hair. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou know. I thought you might need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she lied.</p><p>\u201cJust in case, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so sweet. Do you want to see the town? Where I live? Everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to see the man,\u201d Joey whispered in Mel\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do that last. Doc? Can I have the afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to stand having the two of you yakking and giggling around here all day.\u201d</p><p>Mel rushed on Doc and gave him a kiss on his withered cheek, which the old boy quickly wiped off with a grimace.</p><p>Mel\u2019s spirits were high and she didn\u2019t think about Mark for a little while. She took Joey to all her favorite places, beginning with her cabin in the woods, which Joey thought was charming, if a little in need of her professional decorator\u2019s touch. \u201cYou should have seen it when I arrived,\u201d Mel laughed. \u201cThere was a bird\u2019s nest in the oven!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod!\u201d</p><p>Then they went to the river where there were at least ten men in waders and vests, angling. A couple of them turned and waved to her. \u201cThe first time I was here, Jack brought me and we saw a mama bear and her cub, right downriver, fishing. First and last bear I\u2019ve ever seen. I think I\u2019d like to keep it that way. The next time I came, I fished. I fly fished\u2014not as good as what they\u2019re doing, but I actually caught a fish. I have my own gear in the trunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay!\u201d</p><p>Next, to the Anderson ranch to visit little baby Chloe and see the new lambs. Buck Anderson lifted a couple of little lambs out of the pen and handed one to each woman. Mel stuck her finger in a lamb\u2019s mouth and he closed his little eyes and sucked, making the women say, \u201cAwwww....\u201d</p><p>\u201cI raised six kids\u2014three boys and three girls\u2014and each and every one of them smuggled a lamb into their bedroom to sleep in their beds. Keeping the livestock out of the house was a lifetime chore,\u201d he told them.</p><p>Mel drove her sister down Highway 299 through the redwoods and took great pleasure in her oohs and ahhs. They got out and walked through Fern Canyon, one of the filming sites of Spielberg\u2019s The Lost World. She showed her the back roads of Virgin River, the green pastures, fields of crops, craggy knolls, towering pines, grazing livestock, vineyards in the valley. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to stay awhile and I can pry myself away from Doc, I\u2019ll take you to Grace Valley to meet some of my newer friends. They have a larger clinic there, complete with EKG, a small surgery and ultrasound.\u201d</p><p>Then, as the dinner hour approached, so did a heavy and cool summer shower and they ended up at Jack\u2019s, where the drop in temperature had prompted the laying of a friendly fire. Word had apparently gotten out, because the bar was busier than usual\u2014</p><p>so untypical of a rainy night. Some of her favorite people were present. There was Doc, of course, and Hope McCrea. Ron brought Connie for a little while and where Connie went these days, Joy was nearby with her husband, Bruce. Darryl Fishburn and his parents stopped by and she introduced Darryl as the daddy of her first Virgin River baby. Anne Givens and her husband were there, a couple from out on a big orchard\u2014their first baby was due in August. Preacher treated Joey to his rare smiles, Rick was his usual grinning, adorable self, joking about how the whole family must be gorgeous, and Jack charmed her thoroughly. When he went to the kitchen to get their dinners, Joey leaned close to Mel and said, \u201cHoly crap, is he a hunk or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunk,\u201d Mel confirmed.</p><p>They were served a delicious salmon-in-dill-sauce dinner, which Jack ate with them, and Mel regaled her sister with tales of country doctoring, including the two births she had attended on her own.</p><p>It was a little after seven when Doc\u2019s pager sent him to the phone in Jack\u2019s kitchen. Then he dropped by Mel\u2019s table. \u201cPattersons called. The baby seems to be having trouble breathing and is getting a little pale and blue around the gills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d Mel said. She stood and told Joey, \u201cI delivered that baby and he had a slow start. If I\u2019m late, can you find the cabin?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cSure. Want to give me a key?\u201d</p><p>Mel smiled at her sister. She kissed her cheek. \u201cWe don\u2019t use too many keys around here, sugar. It\u2019s open.\u201d</p> <p>Mel rode with Doc in his truck, just in case some of the dirt roads had gotten soft from the rain. She didn\u2019t want her BMW stuck in the mud.</p><p>They found Sondra and her husband in a state of panic, for the baby did seem to be wheezing. His respirations were accelerated and shallow, but he had no temperature. After a little oxygen, he cleared right up, which did nothing to tell them what was wrong. Mel rocked him for a good long while. Doc sat at the kitchen table and talked to the Pattersons, drinking coffee. \u201cHe\u2019s too young for something like asthma. Might be some kind of allergic reaction, a symptom of an infection, or it could be more serious\u2014a problem with his heart or lungs. Tomorrow you\u2019re going to have to take him over to Valley Hospital to the outpatient clinic for tests. I\u2019ll write down the name of a good pediatrician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he going to be all right through the night?\u201d Sondra asked tearfully.</p><p>\u201cI expect so, but I\u2019ll leave the oxygen. You can drop it off tomorrow. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to spell each other and stay awake, just in case. If you have any problems or you\u2019re worried about him, call me. That little foreign thing of Mel\u2019s isn\u2019t worth a crap on these roads in the rain. Besides, Melinda has company from out of town.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later, Doc was ready to take Mel back to her sister. By eight o\u2019clock, all the patrons had left Jack\u2019s except Joey. Jack had sent Ricky home, Preacher was cleaning up the kitchen, and he brought Joey a cup of coffee and sat down with her again. He asked about her kids, what her husband did, how she liked living in Colorado Springs, and then, \u201cShe didn\u2019t know you were coming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it was a complete surprise. Though it shouldn\u2019t have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour timing couldn\u2019t be better. Something\u2019s been eating at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Joey said. \u201cI guess I thought you knew what was going on. Because she said that you and she...\u201d She stopped and looked into her coffee cup.</p><p>\u201cWe what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Joey raised her eyes and smiled sheepishly. \u201cShe said you kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time she\u2019ll give in a little.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn a place like Virgin River, does that make you a couple?\u201d she asked. He sat back in his chair, willing the bar to stay empty. \u201cYeah, something like that,\u201d he said. \u201cWith a big hunk of something missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know that I have the right...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell me who ripped her heart out and crushed it under the heel of his boot?\u201d he finished for her.</p><p>\u201cHer husband,\u201d Joey said bravely, lifting her chin.</p><p>That caused Jack to sit up straighter. Joey hadn\u2019t said ex-husband. \u201cWhat did he do to her?\u201d he asked, a definite angry edge to his voice.</p><p>Joey sighed. In for a penny, in for a pound, she thought. If Mel hadn\u2019t told him, she didn\u2019t want him to know. She was going to be pissed. \u201cHe got himself murdered in an armed robbery that he happened into by accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurdered,\u201d Jack said weakly.</p><p>\u201cHe was an emergency room doc. He\u2019d worked an all-nighter and stopped into a convenience store for milk on his way home in the morning. The robber panicked and shot him. Three times. He died instantly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGod,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year ago. Today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said again. He leaned an elbow on the table and rested his head in his hand. He massaged his eyes. \u201cShe knows it was today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she knows. She\u2019s been heading for it. Painfully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn L.A.,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t a question. \u201cAnd to think I wanted to punch him in the face a few times for hurting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I feel kind of funny about this. Disloyal. One of the things that drew her here was that no one knows. No one looks at her with pity. No one asks her fifteen times a day how she\u2019s doing, if she\u2019s lost more weight, if she\u2019s sleeping yet...I guess I thought she\u2019d have told you, since...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s holding back,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I let it out. I don\u2019t know whether to be guilty or relieved. Someone who cares about her out here should know what she\u2019s been through. What she\u2019s going through.\u201d</p><p>She took a breath. \u201cI didn\u2019t think she\u2019d make it a week here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither did she.\u201d Jack was quiet for a minute and then said, \u201cCan you imagine what kind of courage it took for her to chuck her big job in L.A. and come to this little town, to work with a man like Doc Mullins? She told me a little about what it was like there\u2014city medicine, she called it. A battle zone, she said. She thought it was going to be real dull and boring here. Then she ends up riding to the hospital with a patient in the back of an old pickup, over these roads, holding an IV bag over her head, freezing. Christ, I could\u2019ve used her in combat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel has always been tough, but Mark\u2019s death really derailed her. That\u2019s why she did this\u2014she started being afraid to go to the bank, the store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she hates guns,\u201d he supplied. \u201cIn a little town where everyone has a gun because they have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, jeez. Look, it\u2019s no secret\u2014I begged her not to do this\u2014I thought it was crazy and way too drastic a change,\u201d Joey said. \u201cBut something about this seems to be working for her. What she calls country doctoring. Or maybe it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has these spells,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen she\u2019s so sad. But it passes and there is such a brightness inside her. You should have seen her the morning after she delivered her first baby at Doc\u2019s. She said she felt like a champ. I\u2019ve never seen anyone so lit up.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled at the memory, but there was a morose tone to his laugh.</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2014I think I\u2019m going to call it a night. Go back to Mel\u2019s and hang out until she gets home, so I can be there for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet Preacher drive you,\u201d he said. \u201cThese roads at night, in the rain, can be treacherous if you don\u2019t know them. The first night Mel drove out to the cabin, she slid off a soft shoulder and had to be towed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Mel?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cDoc might just take her straight home\u2014he has no respect for that little car of hers. Or she could come here for her car\u2014she\u2019s pretty good on these roads now, but if she has any worries about it, I\u2019ll drive her out. Fact is, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if she was out at Patterson\u2019s half the night, so don\u2019t worry. She hates leaving a sick patient. But I\u2019ll wait up.\u201d He went to the bar and got a piece of paper. \u201cCall me if she shows up at the cabin. Or, if you need anything,\u201d he said, writing down his number. It was nearly ten by the time Mel walked into the bar. She saw Jack at the table by the fire, but frowned when she looked around and didn\u2019t see Joey. \u201cWhere\u2019s my sister?\u201d</p><p>she asked. \u201cHer car\u2019s out front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had Preacher take her home in the truck. Her first night in town she shouldn\u2019t have to deal with those roads in the rain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Thanks,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll see you sometime tomorrow, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel?\u201d he called. \u201cSit with me a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should go to Joey. She came all this way...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should talk. About what\u2019s been going on with you.\u201d</p><p>She had been on this precipice for days, teetering on the fine edge of losing it. The only thing that seemed to take her mind off the violent event that changed her life was work. If she had a patient or an emergency, she could lose herself in it. Even the day with her sister, showing Joey the town, the lambs, the beauty, took her away a little bit. But it just kept coming back, haunting her. A picture of him lying on the floor bleeding out could float in front of her eyes and she\u2019d have to pinch them closed, praying she wouldn\u2019t break down. There was no way she could sit down and talk about it. What she needed right now was to get out of here, go home and have a good hard cry. With her sister, who understood.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, her words little more than a breath.</p><p>Jack stood up. \u201cThen let me drive you home,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, holding up a hand. \u201cPlease. I need to just go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just let me hold you. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t be alone.\u201d</p><p>So, Mel thought. She told him! She closed her eyes and held up a hand as if to ward him off. Her nose became red, her lips pink around the edges. \u201cI really want to be alone. Please, Jack.\u201d</p><p>He gave his head a nod and watched her leave.</p><p>Mel went down the porch steps to her car, but she didn\u2019t make it. It hit her before she could get there. She was nearly doubled over by the sudden crushing pain of memory, of loss. The emptiness came back, draining her of all good feelings and filling her up with the horrific unanswerable questions. Why, why, why? How can this happen to a person? Even if I\u2019m not good enough to deserve better, Mark was! He should have lived to be an old man, to save lives and treat people with the brilliance and compassion that made him one of the best emergency room doctors in the city!</p><p>She had made it all day without falling apart, but now in the dark, in the cold night rain, she felt as though she was going to collapse to the ground and just lie there in the mud long enough to perish, to be with him. She stumbled toward a tree and grabbed the trunk, embracing it, holding herself up and holding on at the same time. The cries that came out of her were loud and wrenching.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t we at least have had a baby? Why couldn\u2019t even that small thing have worked in our favor? Just to have a piece of him to live for...</p><p>Inside, Jack paced back and forth in the bar, feeling his own helplessness because he couldn\u2019t do anything for her. He knew all about the crushing pain of loss; even more about the difficulty of getting beyond it. He hated that she\u2019d left without at least letting him try to comfort her.</p><p>Frustrated, he opened the door to go after her. There sat her BMW, right in front of the porch, but she wasn\u2019t in it. He squinted to look into the car, but then he heard her. Sobbing. Wailing. He couldn\u2019t see her. He stepped out onto the porch, went down the steps into the rain. And then he saw her\u2014holding on to the tree, the rain drenching her.</p><p>He ran to her, embracing her from behind, holding the tree with her, holding her against the tree. Her back heaved with her cries, her cheek pressed against the rough bark. The sound of her anguish broke his heart; no way could he let her go, no matter what she said about being alone. This crying made her weeping over baby Chloe look like a mere rehearsal. She was wracked. She started to crumble to the ground and he put his arms under hers and held her upright as the rain soaked them.</p><p>\u201cOh God, oh God, oh God,\u201d she howled. \u201cOh God, oh God, oh God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d he whispered. \u201cLet it go, let it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, why, why?\u201d she cried in the night, her breath coming in jagged gasps. Her whole body jerked and shook as she cried. \u201cOh, God, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet it all out,\u201d he whispered, his lips against her wet hair. She screamed. She opened up her mouth, tipped her head back against him and screamed at the top of her lungs. He hoped she wouldn\u2019t wake the dead, the sound was so powerful. But he only hoped she wasn\u2019t heard so that no one would disturb them and stop this purging. He wanted to do this with her. He wanted to be there for her. The scream subsided into hard sobbing. Then more quietly, \u201cOh, God, I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve got you. I won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Her legs didn\u2019t seem to hold her up anymore; he was keeping her upright. He had the passing thought that no amount of emotion he had ever expelled in his lifetime could match this. It was almost phenomenal in its strength, this pain that gripped her. What had he thought? That his few days of brooding, a good drunk, had been demonstrative of his pain? Hah! He held in his arms a woman who knew more about gut-wrenching pain than he did. His eyes stung. He kissed her cheek. \u201cLet it go,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGet it out. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>It was a long time before she began to cry more softly. Fifteen minutes, maybe. Twenty. Jack knew you don\u2019t stop something like this until it\u2019s over. Till it\u2019s all bled out. They were both soaked to the skin when her breath started coming in little gasps and hiccups. It was a long time before she pushed herself away from the tree and turned toward him. She looked up at his rain soaked face, hers twisted with pain, and said, \u201cI loved him so much.\u201d</p> <p>He touched her wet cheek, unable to tell the tears from the rain. \u201cI know,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt was so unfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I live with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he answered honestly.</p> <p>She let her head drop against his chest. \u201cGod, it hurt so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said again. Then he lifted her in his arms and carried her back into the bar, kicking the door closed behind him. He took her to his room in the back, her arms looped around his neck. He put her down on the big chair in the sitting room. She sat there, shivering, her hands tucked between her knees, her head down, her hair dripping. He went for a clean, dry T-shirt and towels and came back to her, kneeling in front of her. \u201cCome on, Mel. Let\u2019s get you dry.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head and looked at him with eyes that were both terribly sad and exhausted. She was listless. Spent. And her lips were blue with cold. He peeled off her jacket, tossing it on the floor. Then her blouse. He was undressing her like one might a baby, and she didn\u2019t resist. He wrapped a towel around her and keeping her covered, reached beneath and undid her bra, slipping it off without exposing her. He pulled the T-shirt over her head, holding it for her arms, and once it covered her to her thighs, he yanked out the towel. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, pulling her upright. She stood on shaky legs and he unbuttoned and pulled down her trousers before sitting her back down. He removed her boots, socks and pants; he dried her legs and feet with the towel.</p><p>Though still drenched himself, he used the towel to attempt to dry her curling hair, blotting the locks between folds of the towel. He wrapped the throw from the couch around her shoulders, then went to his bureau and found a pair of clean, warm socks. He rubbed her cold feet vigorously, warming them, and put on the socks. When she looked up at him, some sanity had seeped into her eyes, and this made him smile a small smile. \u201cBetter,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>He went to the cupboard in his laundry and brought out a decanter of Remy Martin and two glasses. He poured her a small amount of the brandy, neat, and took it to her, kneeling in front of her. She took a sip and then in a voice both weak and strained, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re still wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he said. \u201cBe right back.\u201d</p> <p>He went to his closet and quickly stripped off his clothes, pulling on only a pair of sweatpants, leaving his chest bare and his wet clothes in a pile on the floor. He poured himself a little brandy and went to her. He sat forward on the sofa at a right angle to her, putting the palm of his hand against her cheek and was pleased to note that she had already warmed. She turned her face against his hand and kissed the palm. \u201cI\u2019ve never been taken care of like this,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never taken care of anyone like this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt seemed like you knew exactly what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guessed,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI crashed,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt was a helluva crash. If you\u2019re going to go down, go down big. You should be proud.\u201d And then he smiled.</p><p>He held her hand as it lay on her lap while she lifted her brandy to her lips with the other hand, trembling a bit. When it was gone, he said, \u201cCome on. I\u2019m putting you to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I cry all night?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right here,\u201d he said. He pulled her hand and led her to his bed, holding up the covers so that she could slip in. He tucked her in as if she were a little girl. Jack dealt with the wet clothes, spinning the water out of them and putting them in the dryer. When he checked on Mel, she was asleep, so he went back into the little laundry and behind closed doors, called Joey. \u201cHi,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to worry. Mel is with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d Joey asked.</p><p>\u201cShe is now. She had a meltdown. Out in the rain, it was awful. I don\u2019t think she has another tear in her, at least for tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I came! I should be with her now...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got her in some clean, dry clothes and put her to bed, Joey. She\u2019s asleep and I\u2014I\u2019ll watch over her. If she wakes up and wants to go home, I\u2019ll take her, no matter what time it is. But for now, let\u2019s let her sleep.\u201d He inhaled deeply. \u201cShe\u2019s had it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack,\u201d Joey said, \u201cwere you with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. She wasn\u2019t alone. I was able to...I held her. Kept her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Joey said, her voice small and shaky.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more to do right now but let her rest. Have a glass of wine, get some sleep and try not to worry about Mel. I\u2019m not going to let anything happen to her.\u201d</p><p>With only a dim night-light in the room, Jack pulled a chair from his table near to the bed. His feet planted on the floor, his elbows resting on his knees and the rest of his Remy clutched in his hands, he watched her sleep. Her hair curled across his pillow and her pink lips were parted slightly. She made little noises in her sleep\u2014little hums and purrs.</p><p>I have a high-school education, he thought. She was married to a medical doctor. A brilliant, educated man. An emergency room hero, made even more perfect in death. How do I compete with that? He reached out and lightly touched her hair. There\u2019s no way, he thought. I\u2019m sunk. And my heart hasn\u2019t beat the same since she walked into town.</p><p>He was in love with her. This man who had never been in love in his life. Not once. As a kid, a young man, he\u2019d thought himself in love a couple of times, but it hadn\u2019t felt like this. Lust, he was familiar with that. Wanting a woman was something he knew quite well\u2014but wanting to take care of a woman so that she would never hurt, never want, never be afraid or lonely\u2014he had no experience with that. There had been beautiful women in his past; intelligent women, clever women, women with wit and courage and passion, but as far as he could remember, never one like Mel; never before a woman who had everything he\u2019d ever wanted. And it just figures, he thought. I\u2019m stupid in love with a woman who isn\u2019t available to me. She\u2019s still in a relationship, albeit a relationship that was no longer viable. Didn\u2019t matter. He\u2019d held her while she was wracked with the pain of losing someone else. She had a lot to get over, to get past. Even if he stood by her and waited for that to happen, it didn\u2019t mean she could fall in love with him. Still, he had no choice. He was into her all the way.</p><p>He finished the brandy, putting aside the glass, but he didn\u2019t leave her. He watched her, occasionally succumbing to the temptation to softly, carefully, touch the silkiness of her hair. When she sighed contentedly in her sleep, he found himself smiling, pleased that she had found some peace. At some point he realized that he knew how she felt\u2014once you know how much you love someone, no one else would do. He looked down at the floor. I\u2019ll be here for you, Mel, he thought. It\u2019s the only place I want to be. When he raised his head, her eyes were open and she was looking at him. He stole a glance at the bedside clock and was surprised to see that two hours had passed.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she said in a whisper. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>He smoothed her hair back from her face. \u201cOf course I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss me, Jack. When you kiss me, I can\u2019t think of anything else.\u201d</p><p>He leaned toward her and touched her lips with his for a soft kiss. Then more firmly, moving over her mouth, feeling her lips open and her small tongue enter. Her hand crept around to the back of his neck to pull him closer, and his kiss became hungrier, deeper.</p><p>\u201cCome in here with me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHold me. Kiss me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back slightly, but she wouldn\u2019t let go of his neck. \u201cI\u2019d better not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little. \u201cI can\u2019t just kiss you, Mel. I\u2019m not a machine. I won\u2019t want to stop.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the covers back for him. \u201cI know,\u201d she said in a breath. \u201cI\u2019m ready, Jack. I don\u2019t want to hurt anymore.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. What if she called out another man\u2019s name? What if the morning came and she was sorry? He had fantasized about this, but he wanted it to be the beginning of something, not the end.</p><p>Then you better make it good for her, he told himself. You\u2019d better leave her wanting more. He slipped in beside her, pulling her into his arms, devouring her mouth with a kiss so hot and powerful she melted to him with a whimper. Her arms went around him, holding him as she yielded to his lips, his tongue. His sweatpants, so loose and soft, left nothing to the imagination and he was instantly hard against her. She moved against him, rubbed against him, inviting him. With a large hand on her bum, he held her there.</p><p>Jack rolled with her, bringing her on top of him. He grabbed the bottom of the T-shirt that covered her and raised it, pulling it over her head. When he felt her breasts against his bare chest, he said, \u201cAhhhh.\u201d Her breasts were soft and full in his big hands, her nipples hard. Running his hands along her ribs to her hips, he found that she still wore her thong panties; he slid them lower and she wiggled out of them. Her skin was so delicate, so smooth, he worried that his hands were too rough for her, but by her soft and eager moans, she was not unhappy with the sensation. Holding her lips with his, he rolled with her again, so that they lay on their sides, and he took a moment to free himself from those sweats. Her hand wrapped around him, causing his breath to catch in his throat, and he thought, better not leave your boots on this time, buddy. You better do it for her. And he concentrated, because he\u2019d never wanted to please a woman more than tonight.</p><p>Feeling her against him like this made it very difficult to slow down, to wait, but by sheer dint of will he managed. He took his leisure of her, employing a slow hand that fondled her breasts. His mouth followed, drawing on one nipple then the other. She arched toward him greedily, spreading her legs, throwing one over his hip, urging him closer. He slipped a hand down and touched her in her soft center, bringing a passionate moan from her. He touched her deeply, and learned that he wasn\u2019t the only one feeling a little desperate. She was ready for him. Starving. \u201cMel,\u201d he said in a throaty whisper.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He turned her onto her back and held himself over her. He captured her mouth with his and entered her in one long, slow, deep, powerful stroke that caused her to gasp and rise against him urgently. With one hand under her bottom and the other still caressing a place that turned her sighs to moans, he began to move within her. The heat of her nearly drove him out of his mind, but he held on. He was determined that her needs would come before his own. He moved steadily, pushing and pulling, and within moments her breathing came harder and faster, her body straining toward his, reaching for satisfaction. He was more than happy to deliver it, pushing into her, rubbing against her. And then he felt those hot spasms of fulfillment, heard her cry out in ecstasy and he held her fast, pressing himself into her. In that moment of blinding pleasure, she bit down on his shoulder; sweet, welcome pain. And he hung on with all the strength he could muster, saving himself, and finally she weakened beneath him and the clenching spasms that surrounded him slowly subsided. Her body relaxed and her breathing began to slow. Her pants became sighs and her kisses came soft and sweet against his lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Mel stroked his back, tasted his mouth, her body still quivering from a thundering climax. She felt the muscles of his shoulders and back at work as he held himself up enough to keep from crushing her with his weight. When he released her mouth and looked into her eyes, she saw in his a smoldering fire that was not even close to being extinguished. She put her palm against his cheek. \u201cOh, Jack,\u201d she said, breathless. His name on her lips brought him such pleasure, he felt himself expand somewhere inside his chest, as if his heart grew just a little bit. He lowered his lips and sucked gently at hers. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYou were right there. You know exactly how all right I am,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long, long time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s never going to be that long again,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNot ever again.\u201d</p><p>He began to move down her body with his lips and tongue, kissing and nibbling, tasting in slow, delicate strokes. He ran a tongue around each nipple until they were hard little pebbles, perfect for his mouth. He slid lower, until he had moved down over her flat belly. He gently parted her legs and buried his face in her, hearing her gasp above him. No longer delicate, he went to work on that prominent, erogenous knot in her center. He felt her moving her hips against his mouth and when her breathing became rapid and labored once more he rose, slowly kissing his way up her body.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re sweet,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cYou taste like heaven.\u201d He slid into her again, filling her, moving in long deep strokes that became powerful thrusts that brought her to yet another shattering climax. Again she cried out and he covered her open mouth with his. Swept away, she couldn\u2019t be quiet, and that thrilled him. Every sound, every wild cry gave him joy. He held her as she collapsed beneath him, spent.</p><p>Jack felt her small hands on his back, her lips on his neck, and her breathing inevitably slowed and came under control. To his surprise he heard the sound of her soft laughter. He raised above her and looked at her smile. \u201cYou lied to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou are a machine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just wanted to make you happy,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been happy a couple of times. What can I do so that you can join me?\u201d</p><p>He laced his fingers through hers and holding her hands, stretched her arms up above her head, holding them there. \u201cBaby, you don\u2019t have to do anything but be present.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his mouth to hers, kissed her deeply and began to move inside her once more, pumping his hips. She lifted her knees and tilted beneath him, bringing him deeper, and he could feel her begin to move in concert with him. She wrapped her legs around his waist and he followed the rhythm she set in place. He rocked with her, slow and steady, deep and long, hanging on to control until he heard her moaning and sighing rise again, her tempo increased, and finally the noises she made, already familiar to him, already beautiful to him, told him she was reaching for yet another orgasm. He had expected her to be passionate, but the heat and power of her passion amazed him, and it filled a need in him. And this time, when she clenched around him and pleasure stole her breath away, he let himself go and matched her. Surpassed her. For a moment, through the powerful pulsing, he felt light-headed. His eyes watered. And he heard it again. \u201cJack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Mel...Ah, baby,\u201d he whispered, kissing her, loving her. He gently caressed her as she calmed. \u201cJack,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have to be sorry about?\u201d he asked in a whisper.</p> <p>\u201cI think I bit you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, a deep throaty sound. \u201cI think you did. Is that a habit of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must have been a little out of control...\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cI take the blame,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was all part of the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhhh,\u201d she said. \u201cI might\u2019ve lost my mind there for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI love it when that happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were taking a big chance, driving an already crazy woman out of her mind like that...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, you were in good hands. You were always safe.\u201d He kissed her softly. \u201cWould you like to rest now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe for a little while,\u201d she answered, her hands gentle on his face. He gathered her close to him, holding her. Their naked bodies entwined, they spooned. He kissed the back of her neck as she lay on his arm. His face rested against her soft, fragrant hair, one arm over her and cupping her breast. Very soon he could hear the sounds of her even breathing, her sleep. He closed his eyes and relaxed with her in his arms, finding sleep himself.</p><p>Sometime in the dark of night he opened his eyes to find she had rolled over to face him, her hands boldly caressing him. He kissed her and asked, \u201cHave you slept?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd woke up wanting you. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it\u2019s pretty obvious, the feeling is mutual.\u201d</p><p>Mel woke in the early morning and to her surprise, there was a song in her head. She was humming along with Johnny Mathis in her sleep. \u201cDeep Purple.\u201d Her music was back.</p><p>She rolled over to find the bed beside her empty. She could hear the sound of Jack splitting logs in the backyard. She rinsed her mouth and rubbed his toothpaste against her teeth. A light blue, long-sleeved denim shirt hung on a hook in his closet and she put it on, sniffing the collar, smiling at his scent on it. It more than covered her; she was drowning in it. She went to the back door and stood watching him heft the ax and bring it down. Thwack. The air was clear and sharp; the rain was gone and the huge trees were washed clean. She watched him heft the ax again, and bring it down. His shirtsleeves were rolled up to the elbows and his biceps rippled under the weight and force of the ax.</p><p>Then he looked in her direction. She lifted a hand toward him and smiled. He dropped the ax at once and came to her. As he stood before her, she put her hand on his chest. He ran the back of a knuckle against her pink cheek. \u201cI think I roughed you up a little with whiskers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Don\u2019t worry about it. I like it. It feels right. Natural. Good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love the way you look in my shirt,\u201d he said. \u201cI love the way you look out of my shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we have a little time,\u201d she said.</p><p>He swooped her up into his arms, kicking the door closed behind him, and bore her gently to the bed.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>T he morning air was cool and foggy as Mel drove to her cabin. The front door was open, letting in the crisp June morning air. She kicked off her muddy boots on the porch and when she went inside found Joey sitting on the sofa, a quilt wrapped around her, a steaming cup of freshly brewed coffee on the table beside her. Joey lifted a side of the quilt for Mel and Mel went to her, cuddling beside her, resting her head on Joey\u2019s shoulder. Joey pulled the quilt snugly around them both. \u201cYou okay, baby sis?\u201d Joey asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. I lost it last night.\u201d She turned her head and looked up at her older sister.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I see that coming? You did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe anniversary of deaths has a reputation,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t remember the exact date\u2014it\u2019ll sneak up on you and knock the wind out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure did,\u201d she said, lying her head back down on Joey\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI knew what day it was. I just didn\u2019t expect such a dramatic event.\u201d</p><p>Joey stroked Mel\u2019s hair. \u201cYou weren\u2019t alone, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just wouldn\u2019t have believed it, even if you\u2019d seen it. I was completely out of control, standing in the rain, screaming. I screamed for a long time. He just held me and let me. He kept telling me to let it out. Then he took care of me like you would a stroke victim. Undressed me, got me into dry clothes, gave me a brandy and put me to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Jack must be a very good man...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I invited him into bed with me,\u201d Mel said. Joey said nothing. \u201cWe made love all night long. I\u2019ve never had so much sex in my life. I mean\u2014never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re all right,\u201d she said, and it was not a question.</p><p>\u201cWhen I lifted the blanket for him, all I could think was, this will numb me. Rub out the pain, give me escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>Mel looked at Joey again. \u201cIt didn\u2019t exactly work that way,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe if he\u2019d been average, I could\u2019ve closed my eyes and just gone to a happy place. But he\u2019s not average. Holy shit, he\u2019s astonishing.\u201d</p><p>Joey laughed a little, sentimentally. Sisters. They had talked about sex since they were teenagers. Laughed about it, told dark secrets about it. With Mark\u2019s death, Joey had feared these kind of talks would never happen again.</p><p>\u201cAll he wanted was for me to have pleasure. Wild, blinding, crazed pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Again Joey laughed. \u201cDid it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d she said in a breath. Then she turned and looked at her sister. \u201cDo you think he just felt sorry for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you were there. Do you think that?\u201d</p><p>Mel smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she said. \u201cI just hope he feels sorry for me again, real soon.\u201d</p><p>Joey smoothed the curly hair away from her sister\u2019s pretty brow. \u201cI\u2019m glad you have this in your life again.\u201d And then she giggled, and so did Mel.</p><p>\u201cHow did this happen, Joey? That I went from wanting to die, to wanting Jack?</p><p>Wanting him so much I was almost a maniac? Wouldn\u2019t you think that would be impossible? That I wouldn\u2019t be able to even think like that?\u201d</p><p>Joey took a breath. \u201cI think when your emotions reach a pitch like that, it follows suit. You just feel everything more intensely. I think it makes stupid sense, actually. Haven\u2019t you ever noticed that some of the best sex seems to follow a big fight? I\u2019m pretty sure I conceived Ashley on the same night I told Bill that if I didn\u2019t just leave him, I\u2019d at least never speak to him again.\u201d</p><p>Giggles.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even asked you how long you can stay,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cI can stay as long as you want me to, but a truly kind sister would pack up and get out of your hair right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much.\u201d She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s a sacrifice I\u2019m willing to make for you.\u201d</p><p>Joey hugged her close. \u201cA few days, then. If you\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Joey revisited a topic from their earliest discussions on this subject, reaching back to their high-school and college days. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s any truth to that old wives\u2019</p><p>tale that you can tell from the size of a man\u2019s foot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. What size boot do you think Jack wears?\u201d</p><p>Giggles.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-seven,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>Mel took Joey with her to Doc\u2019s that very morning. Joey cozied up in the kitchen with a book while Mel and Doc saw a few patients. The three of them had lunch together at the house, then the girls went to Grace Valley where they visited June and John at the clinic. There were no patients scheduled for the next day and Doc wore his pager while he went to the river to fish, so Joey and Mel drove all the way to the coast, having lunch in the adorable little Victorian town of Ferndale. They visited the shops\u2014there were things that Joey thought would be perfect for Mel\u2019s cabin\u2014a throw for the sofa, some accent pillows, a wall clock, colorful place mats. They stopped off and bought a small barbecue for the yard and wooden salad bowls. A vase that would complement the table. On the way home they went to the market and bought some groceries and fresh flowers.</p><p>It seemed like a quick beer at Jack\u2019s was in order and they went into the bar arm in arm, laughing because Mel had whispered, \u201cIf I catch you looking at his crotch, I will slap you.\u201d Which almost guaranteed Joey was going to find the temptation irresistible. Then they invited him to come out to the cabin for dinner, and he not only eagerly accepted, he brought a six-pack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>They told stories from their childhood and teenage years that had him laughing right along with them till almost midnight.</p><p>When Jack was getting ready to leave, Joey slipped discreetly away so Mel could say good night to him in private. Outside, on the porch, with only the filtered light from inside the cabin, Jack stepped down a step so that he could be eye-to-eye with Mel. She draped her arms over his shoulders while he encircled her waist with his large hands. She leaned toward him and teasingly nibbled at his lower lip.</p> <p>\u201cYou told her everything,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d she said, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cShe keeps looking at my crotch,\u201d he said.</p><p>Giggles. \u201cNot everything,\u201d she said. \u201cI kept the more delicious stuff to myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been all right?\u201d he asked, drawing his brows together in concern. \u201cAny more tears?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCompletely all right.\u201d She smiled.</p><p>\u201cI miss you already, Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only been a couple of days...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you after a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be a lot of trouble, aren\u2019t you? Demanding, imposing, insatiable...\u201d</p><p>He covered her mouth in a searing kiss that answered the question. She yielded happily, holding him closely. Ah, she thought. This is such a wonderful, powerful, sexy man. She never wanted it to end, but at length it had to. \u201cI have to go,\u201d he said in a husky voice. \u201cEither that, or carry you into the woods.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know, Sheridan...This place is growing on me.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a little peck on the lips. \u201cYour sister is great, Mel.\u201d He gave her another.</p><p>\u201cGet rid of her,\u201d he said. Then with a whack on the butt, he turned and left her. When he got to his truck and opened his door, he turned to look at her. He stood there for a long time. Then he slowly lifted his hand. And she did the same. Jack was sweeping off the porch at the bar the next morning when he saw Joey and Mel walk out of Doc\u2019s house and embrace at Joey\u2019s car. Then Mel walked back inside and to his surprise, Joey came over to the bar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to shove off,\u201d she said to him. \u201cI thought I\u2019d beg a cup of coffee from you on my way out of town. Mel has a couple of patients this morning, or she\u2019d have come with me. So we said our goodbyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be glad to buy you breakfast,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2019ve had a little something already. But I\u2019m not going to pass up your coffee. And I wanted a moment. To talk. To say goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing up,\u201d he said. He leaned the broom against the wall and held the door for her. She jumped up on a stool and he went behind the bar to serve her coffee. \u201cIt was great meeting you, Joey. And spending a little time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You, too. But mostly, thanks for what you\u2019ve done for Mel. For taking care of her, looking out for her...\u201d</p> <p>He poured himself a mug. \u201cI think you know\u2014you don\u2019t have to thank me. I\u2019m not doing anybody any favors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Still...Just so you know, it\u2019s easier for me to leave her here, knowing that she isn\u2019t all alone.\u201d</p><p>It was on his mind to tell her that he hadn\u2019t felt like this since he was sixteen. All steamed up, crazy in love, willing to take a lot of chances for just one chance. But what he said was, \u201cShe won\u2019t be alone. I\u2019ll keep an eye on things.\u201d</p><p>She sipped her coffee. She seemed to struggle with something. \u201cJack, there\u2019s something you should keep in mind. Just because the crisis seems to have passed doesn\u2019t mean...Well, there could still be some struggles ahead for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about him,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>Joey was startled. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it might be a long time before I can ask Mel. And because I\u2019d like to know.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cWell, you have every right to ask. I\u2019ll do my best. But the only thing that allows the rest of us to hold it together as well as we do is because Mel has been so fragile. It was like losing a brother. It was losing a brother. We all loved Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have been one helluva guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d She sipped more of her coffee. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2014Mark was thirtyeight when he died, so that made him thirty-two when he met Mel. They met at the hospital. He was the senior resident in the emergency room and she was charge nurse on the swing shift. They fell in love right away, moved in together a year later, married a year after that and had been married four years. I think the most characteristic things about Mark were his compassion and sense of humor. He could make anyone laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnd he was the one doctor you wanted in Emergency when there was a crisis that required the family be handled with kindness, with sensitivity. Our whole family loved him right off. His entire staff adored him.\u201d</p><p>Jack didn\u2019t realize that he chewed absently on his lower lip.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to remember that he wasn\u2019t perfect,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be doing a guy a big favor by telling me one or two things that made him less than perfect,\u201d he said.</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cWell, let\u2019s see. He clearly loved Mel very much and he was a good husband, but she used to say that his first wife was the E.R. It\u2019s that way with doctors anyway, and I don\u2019t think it was much more than an irritation\u2014she was a nurse and knew the score. But they fought about his long hours, about him going into the hospital even when he wasn\u2019t on call. There were lots of times they had plans and he didn\u2019t show up. Or he\u2019d leave early and she\u2019d take a cab home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s how it is,\u201d Jack said. Marines left their families behind to do the country\u2019s work abroad. While a part of him wished that Mel had hated her husband for frequently abandoning her for work, there was another part that held a grudging respect for a woman who knew the ways of the world and held strong through them.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t think it threatened their marriage, not really. He\u2019d get absorbed in his work and miss entire conversations. She said she sometimes thought she was talking to a wall. But of course, Mark being Mark, he\u2019d apologize and try to make it up to her. I\u2019m sure if he hadn\u2019t died, they\u2019d have stayed married for fifty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Joey,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t he drink too much, smack her around, cheat on her?\u201d he asked hopefully. So hopefully that it made Joey laugh. She dug around in her purse, pulled out her wallet and flipped through the pictures until she came to one of Mel and Mark. \u201cThis was taken about a year before he died,\u201d</p><p>It was a studio portrait, husband and wife. Mark had his arm around her and they were both smiling\u2014carefree. Her eyes twinkled; so did his. A doctor and a nurse midwife\u2014brilliant, successful people\u2014they had the world by the balls. Mark\u2019s face was familiar to Jack, having seen the picture beside her bed. But he looked at this with new eyes, knowing what he knew. Mark was not bad looking\u2014and this was the only context under which Jack would allow himself to make such an assessment of another man. Short, neat brown hair, oval face, straight teeth. He would have been thirty-seven in the picture, but he looked much younger\u2014he had a baby face. He did not look unlike many of the young marines Jack had taken into battle with him.</p><p>\u201cA doctor,\u201d Jack said absently, staring at the picture.</p><p>\u201cHell, don\u2019t be intimidated by that,\u201d Joey said. \u201cMel could easily have been a doctor. She holds a bachelor\u2019s in nursing and post-grad degree in family nurse practitioner with a certification in midwifery. She\u2019s got a brain bigger than my butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. That Joey\u2019s butt wasn\u2019t big was not the point she was making.</p><p>\u201cThey had as many arguments as any couple,\u201d Joey said. \u201cVacations brought out the worst in them\u2014they never wanted to do the same things. If he wanted to golf, she wanted to go to the beach. They usually ended up going somewhere he could golf while she lay on the beach, which might sound like a reasonable compromise, except for one thing\u2014they weren\u2019t spending the vacation together. That used to piss her off,\u201d</p><p>she added. \u201cAnd Mel, pissed off, is unbearable.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Joey went on, \u201che was lousy with money. Paid absolutely no attention. His focus had been purely on medicine for so long, he\u2019d forget to pay bills. Mel took over that job right away to keep the lights from being turned off. And he was pretty anal about tidiness\u2014I\u2019d eat off the floor of his garage in a second.\u201d</p><p>Such urban, upper-class problems, Jack found himself thinking.</p><p>\u201cNot an outdoorsman, I guess,\u201d Jack said. \u201cNo camping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit in the woods?\u201d she laughed. \u201cNot our man, Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny that Mel would come here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s rugged country. Not too refined. Never fancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah,\u201d Joey said, looking into her coffee cup. \u201cShe loves the mountains, loves nature\u2014but Jack, you need to know something...this was an experiment. She was a little crazy and decided she wanted everything different. But it isn\u2019t her. Before Mark died, she must have had subscriptions to a dozen fashion and decorating magazines. She loves to travel\u2014first class. She knows the names of at least twenty five-star chefs.\u201d She took a breath and looked into his kind eyes. \u201cShe might have a fishing pole in her trunk right now, but she\u2019s not going to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRod and reel,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Joey asked.</p><p>\u201cRod and reel, not a fishing pole. She really likes it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of your heart, Jack. You\u2019re a real nice guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay, Joey,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cShe\u2019ll be okay, too. That\u2019s the important thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing. Just tell me you understand what I\u2019m telling you. She might have run from that old life, but it\u2019s still inside her somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Don\u2019t worry. She was good enough to warn me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Joey said. \u201cSo, what do you do for vacation?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on vacation everyday,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cMel said you were in the Marine Corps\u2014what did you do then? When you had leave?\u201d</p><p>Well, he wanted to say, if I wasn\u2019t recovering from some wound and we were in country, I\u2019d get drunk with the boys and find a woman. A far cry from flying firstclass to the islands to tan on the sandy beach or snorkel in the bay. But he didn\u2019t say that; it was another life. One he left behind. People do that, he thought briefly and hopefully; leave another life behind and move on to something new. Different. \u201cIf I had a long leave, I\u2019d visit the family. I have four married sisters in Sacramento and they live for the opportunity to boss me around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice for you,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cWell, you have any more questions? About Mel? Mark?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t dare. More information about the sainted Mark might do him in. \u201cNo. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I\u2019m going to get going\u2014I have a long drive and a plane to catch.\u201d</p><p>She jumped off the stool and he came around the bar. He opened his arms to her and she happily gave him a robust hug. \u201cThanks again,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he returned. \u201cAnd Joey, I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack. You don\u2019t have to compete with him, you know.\u201d</p><p>He put an arm around her and walked her out onto the porch. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d she said again.</p><p>He gave her shoulders a final squeeze and watched as she walked across the street to where her car sat at Doc\u2019s. She gave one last wave as she drove out of town. Jack couldn\u2019t help but spend way too much time trying to picture Mel\u2019s life as it had been with Mark. He saw an upscale home and expensive cars. Diamonds as birthday gifts and country club memberships. Trips to Europe; to the Caribbean to unwind and relax from the high stress of city medicine. Dinner dances and charity events. The kind of lifestyle that even if Jack could fit into it, he wouldn\u2019t want to. The upscale life wasn\u2019t alien to him\u2014his sisters lived in that world very well. They and their husbands were educated, successful people; they had grappled with finding the best schools so their girls would be likewise. Donna, the oldest at forty-five, was a college professor, married to a professor. Jeannie, the next at forty-three, was a CPA married to a developer. Then there was Mary, thirty-seven, a commercial airline pilot married to a real estate broker\u2014they were the country clubbers. His baby sister and the most bossy\u2014and his favorite\u2014was Brie, almost thirty, a county D.A. married to a police detective. He was the only one in the family who had gone into the military as an enlisted man\u2014as a mere boy\u2014educated only through high school. And found that what he had a gift for was physical challenge and military strategy. He wondered if Joey was right, that Mel couldn\u2019t possibly be happy here for long in this dinky little town full of ranchers and blue-collar types, without a five-star chef within three hundred miles. Maybe she was just too classy for this backwoods life. But then an image of the Melinda he\u2019d fallen in love with would float into his mind\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>she was natural and unspoiled, tough and sassy, uninhibited and passionate, stubborn. Perhaps it was a premature worry\u2014he\u2019d hardly given her a chance. It was always possible she\u2019d find things here to love.</p><p>He didn\u2019t see her all that day. He never left the bar, just in case she came by for a sandwich or cup of coffee, but she didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t until almost six that she showed her face. As she walked in, he felt that sensation that had become so common for him lately\u2014desire. One look at her in those tight jeans and he was in agony. It took willpower to keep himself from responding physically.</p> <p>There were people present\u2014the dinner crowd and about six fishermen from out of town\u2014so she said hello to everyone she knew on her way to the bar. She jumped up on a stool and, smiling, said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind a cold beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d He fixed her up a draft. Now this woman, looking like a mere girl really, asking for a beer and not a champagne cocktail, this did not fit the picture he\u2019d had earlier of the country club set, the diamonds, the charity dinner dances. Still, seeing her in a fitted, strapless black dress\u2014he could manage that. It made him smile.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s funny?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cJust happy to see you, Mel. Going to have dinner tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. We were busier than I thought we\u2019d be all morning, so I fixed Doc and I something to eat at around three. I\u2019m not hungry. I\u2019ll just enjoy this.\u201d</p> <p>The door opened and Doc Mullins came in. A couple of months ago he\u2019d have sat at the other end of the bar, but no more. He was still as grouchy as he could manage, but he took the stool next to Mel and Jack poured him a short bourbon. \u201cDinner?\u201d he asked the doctor.</p><p>\u201cIn a minute,\u201d he answered.</p><p>The door opened again and in came Hope. She had finally discarded the rubber boots in favor of tennis shoes\u2014just as muddy. She sat on Mel\u2019s other side. \u201cOh, good, you\u2019re not eating,\u201d she said, pulling a pack of cigarettes out of her pocket. \u201cJack?\u201d she asked, requesting her usual Jack Daniel\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cJack coming up, neat,\u201d he said, pouring.</p><p>Hope puffed and asked, \u201cSo, how\u2019d your sister like your little town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a good time, thanks. Though she expressed some concern about the state of my roots.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet that old codger to give you a day off and go over to Garberville or Fortuna and get a do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing but days off anymore,\u201d Doc grumbled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting statement coming from someone who didn\u2019t want any help around here,\u201d Mel teased. Then to Hope she said, \u201cYou know big sisters. She just wanted to make sure I hadn\u2019t gotten myself into anything that held the potential for disaster, and now that she\u2019s convinced I\u2019ll live, she can go back to her family with a clear conscience. What have you been doing with yourself, Hope?\u201d Mel asked. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen much of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the garden, from morning till night. I plant and grow, the deer come in and eat it. I need to round up Jack\u2019s marines and get \u2019em all out there to pee a border around the property.\u201d</p><p>Mel sat back. \u201cThat works?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah. Better than anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, live and learn,\u201d she said. Mel finished her beer. \u201cI\u2019m going home,\u201d she stated flatly, getting off her stool.</p><p>Mel was barely out the door when she felt Jack come up behind her. He took her arm and walked with her to her car. Once there she turned to him and said, \u201cThink you can find your way out to that little cabin?\u201d</p> <p>He leaned down to kiss her and groaned. It was happening to him again. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cTake your time. Give me a head start so I can wash Hope\u2019s cigarette out of my hair. Go finish serving dinner.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his lips to her neck. \u201cI\u2019m going to walk back in there and yell Fire!\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him and pulled away. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d she said. And got in her car to leave.</p><p>Mel drove home knowing that he was starving and wouldn\u2019t be long. He was the most sexually driven man she\u2019d ever known. But there were a couple of things she wanted to do. When she got home, she put her medical bag by the front door and went to the bedroom. She sat on the bed, picked up Mark\u2019s picture and held it. She looked into his kind eyes and mentally said to him, \u201cYou know I love you, and I know you understand.\u201d And then she slipped it into the drawer.</p><p>Then she went to the shower to freshen up.</p><p>Jack went back behind the bar and made sure everyone was taken care of. He brought Doc his dinner, said good night to Hope as she left, then went for Preacher. \u201cIt\u2019s thinning out,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going out to Mel\u2019s,\u201d he added, knowing Preacher would have his tongue cut out before he\u2019d tell anyone. As if anyone needed telling. When Jack and Mel were in the same room, the air warmed up. People glanced at them knowingly. \u201cYou can reach me there if you need me. Don\u2019t need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cRicky and I can handle things.\u201d</p><p>Jack might\u2019ve driven a little too fast down the curving, tree-canopied road, but he was dying for her. He parked and went to the porch, sitting in one of the Adirondack chairs to pull off his boots. Inside, he heard the shower running and called out so he wouldn\u2019t frighten her. \u201cMel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out in a minute,\u201d she called back.</p><p>But he was already out of his shirt, his hands on his belt buckle. He left a trail of clothes through the living room to the bathroom. The glass of the shower was steamed and inside was her small naked form in the mist. He slowly opened the door and stood there looking at her in all her glistening beauty. God, she was so perfect. She reached a small, inviting hand in his direction and he stepped in with her.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t take your time,\u201d she said against his lips.</p><p>\u201cI tried,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to freshen up for you.\u201d</p><p>He covered her mouth with his, but his hands were all over her, running up and down her smooth, soft back, over her bottom, caressing her breasts, digging into her wet hair, down her neck and over her shoulders, down her arms to entwine his fingers with hers. He trembled, he wanted her so badly. And her hands were on him, running over his chest, around to his back, filling her hands with the hard muscles on his butt, and finally over his flat belly and down to his swollen erection, causing him to say,</p><p>\u201cOhhhh...Mel...\u201d before capturing her lips anew.</p><p>His fingers wandered lower to examine her, gently probing. It made him swell with some kind of erotic pride to find that she was slick and as anxious as he. This woman didn\u2019t need much warming up. This mutual need, this had become the best part of his life. He lifted her up. Her arms went around his neck, her legs around his waist and he settled her upon him, entering her slowly, firmly. He turned with her in his arms, bracing a shoulder against the shower wall. Then he began to move her upon him, lifting her up and down. Her sighs became quickened breaths, her legs tightened around him.</p><p>Mel hung on to his shoulders and neck, her mouth on his, their tongues hot and desperate as they devoured each other. The sensation of his arms and shoulders at work as he held her caused her blood to boil and she felt her desire rising and rising to a wonderful pitch that soon erupted into bliss.</p><p>Jack loved nothing so much as bringing her that crazy moment and feeling her tighten around him. When she cried out, he held her closer, if possible. He reached himself as far inside her as humanly possible and the storm of his own wild climax shook him to his core.</p><p>She held on to him, he on to her, while they calmed, their breathing slowly returning to normal. She nibbled at his lip and said, a little breathlessly, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that was even possible. Being with you...It\u2019s an adventure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do something to me. You drive me out of my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You do good work, brainless.\u201d And then she laughed and touched his shoulder. \u201cYou have a little bruise...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love that little bruise...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s dry off and meet in the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask me twice. But please, don\u2019t move just yet. This part is dicey.\u201d</p><p>He held her a moment longer and then, carefully and slowly, lifted her up and away from him, setting her down on her feet in the shower. They showered off, dried off. Mel needed a little extra time to dry that golden mane of hers\u2014emerging roots and all. Jack went to the bedroom and sat on the bed. It was gone\u2014the picture. He wasn\u2019t an idiot, he knew that only the picture was gone, not the memories. Still, it made him smile to himself. He settled himself in her bed and waited impatiently. When she came to the bedroom, she reached for the light and he said, \u201cLeave it on, Mel.\u201d Without questioning him, she slid into the bed beside him. Lying on his side, he rose up, his head braced on his hand. \u201cThere are a couple of things we should talk about. The other night wasn\u2019t about talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh-oh,\u201d she said, suddenly on edge. \u201cIs this the part where you explain about casual sex and consenting adults?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cNot at all. Just details. I want you to know something\u2014there have been...women. You know? Mel, I\u2019m forty. I\u2019ve never been celibate. I always wore a condom. Always. Plus, the marines were ridiculous about medicals, including tests for STDs. But if you\u2019d like me to be tested...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tend to be cautious...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone. And then, we didn\u2019t talk about birth control, and I don\u2019t want to be irresponsible. This comes a little after the fact\u2014I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got that covered. But, if you\u2019re so used to putting on the condom, what happened the other night?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anything handy, and the only thing on my mind was making sure everything was good. It started out as such a bad night for you and Jesus, I didn\u2019t want you to regret it. I guess I went a little crazy. But I can be prepared in the future. Just say the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tonight?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI apologize\u2014in the pocket of those jeans on the living room floor, there\u2019s...Sorry. I was so ready to be with you. I was out of my head, Mel. It doesn\u2019t have to be like that every\u2014\u201d</p><p>She put a finger on his lips, smiled and whispered, \u201cI like it like it is. When you\u2019re a little crazy.\u201d She looked up into his eyes. \u201cOrdinarily, I would have thought of the condom, but I guess the state I was in...well. If you\u2019ll just take care of that screening, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be all right. Have there been an awful lot of women?\u201d</p><p>He made a face. A frown. \u201cMore than I like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny really special ones?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to think I\u2019m lying. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the woman in Clear River?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMel, we were only sleeping together. No, not true\u2014I never spent a night. She didn\u2019t come to Virgin River. I never thought I\u2019d be embarrassed about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be embarrassed. You\u2019re a grown-up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like this. This feel casual to you?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cActually, it feels a little intense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything about this is different. I hope you understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not just sleeping with me?\u201d she asked, teasingly.</p><p>\u201cI am sleeping with you,\u201d he said, running his hand over her smooth shoulder and down her arm. He gave her a sweet, short kiss. \u201cIt\u2019s not just sex. It\u2019s everything. It\u2019s special.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cAre you seeing me?\u201d she teased. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a first for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, in some ways, you\u2019re just a virgin from Virgin River.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn this, I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is madness, I want you all the time. I feel like a kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t act like a kid,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMelinda\u2014I have had more erections in the last week than I\u2019ve had in the last decade. Every time you walk by, I have to concentrate on something else. This hasn\u2019t happened to me since I was sixteen, when anything from a beer commercial to a geography assignment could put me in agony. It was almost laughable, if it wasn\u2019t just so ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRaging hormones,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cYou are an amazing lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing this alone,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty amazing yourself. Damn, baby. We fit together real nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2014does everyone in town know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d be guessing. I haven\u2019t said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow, I don\u2019t think you have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could try to keep it quiet, if that works better for you. I could manage to not look at you like I\u2019m going to have you for dessert, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that...well, you know. I have these issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I held you through some major issues. And I do understand that it\u2019s going to take more than a little sex to resolve all that.\u201d He grinned. \u201cGood sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah...\u201d he agreed breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know. I\u2019m still all screwed up. I don\u2019t want to disappoint you. Jack, I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>He ran a hand down her body, lightly brushing her soft, warm skin. \u201cMel, this doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d He smiled. \u201cIt feels real, real good. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d He gave her a light kiss. \u201cYou want to try to keep this...us...quiet? Private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink it would work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s probably no point in pretending,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s your call.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, what the hell,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t against the law, is it?\u201d</p><p>He leaned over her and kissed her more deeply. \u201cIt probably should be.\u201d He kissed her again.</p><p>In the early morning as dawn was just beginning to streak through the cabin windows, Jack was stirred awake by the soft sound of slightly off-key humming. He found Mel nestled into the crook of his arm, her breath tickling his chest. She was purring, humming, her lips moving slightly, as though singing. It might\u2019ve troubled him if her expression had been sad or disturbed. But she was smiling. She snuggled closer, throwing a leg over his. And this sleepy little music, contented, drifted out of her. He could count on one hand the number of times he\u2019d spent the entire night in bed with a woman. And already, he couldn\u2019t imagine waking up alone. He pulled her closer knowing he\u2019d never been happier in his life.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>R ick called Liz every couple of days, although he wanted to call her seven times a day. His pulse always picked up when he dialed, then the sound of her voice made it race.</p><p>\u201cLizzie, how you doing?\u201d he\u2019d ask.</p><p>\u201cI miss you,\u201d she would always say. \u201cYou said you\u2019d come over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to. I\u2019m trying. But with school and work...So, how are...things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wish I was there, instead of here.\u201d Then she\u2019d laugh. \u201cFunny, I hated my mother for making me go to Aunt Connie\u2019s, and now I hate her for making me stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hate your mom, Liz. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Then they\u2019d talk for a while, about kids, about school, about Virgin River and Eureka, just mundane stuff. She never volunteered any information about the feared pregnancy.</p><p>Rick was dying a million deaths. He was terrified something had gone wrong and she was caught with a baby on that one and only night. But almost worse than that, he wasn\u2019t sure what was happening to him, in his head, in his body. He dreamt about her, wanted to feel his arms around her, wanted to smell her hair and kiss her lips. He wanted her breast in one hand, but he also wanted to have her riding beside him in that little truck on the way to and from school, cracking jokes, laughing, holding hands. This phone call was no different than the others had been. Then she asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come to Eureka?\u201d</p><p>He drew a heavy breath. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth, Liz\u2014I\u2019m afraid to. You and me, we get pretty worked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have those rubbers...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you before, that\u2019s not enough. You have to get something, too. Pills or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019m I gonna do that? I don\u2019t even drive. You think I should say to my mom,</p><p>\u2018Hey, I have to get some birth control\u2014me and Ricky want to do it\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you were here, you could see Mel. Maybe you can talk your mom into a visit to Virgin River.\u201d But even as he said that, he cringed. And flushed so hot he thought he might faint. Was he really suggesting to a fourteen-year-old that she get herself fixed up so they could have sex? In the cab of a truck?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI think I would hate that. I don\u2019t think I could tell someone who\u2019s like, grown-up. Could you?\u201d</p><p>He already had; Preacher and Jack both knew. But he said, \u201cI could if it was this important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d</p><p>If you couldn\u2019t stop dreaming about a girl, if you constantly thought about the way her hair felt against your cheek, if you couldn\u2019t get the softness of her skin out of your mind, did that mean you loved her? If you felt a little better after every time you talked to her, heard her laugh, did that mean anything, or were you just this horny sixteen-year-old boy? He knew he was that\u2014the thought of getting inside her again almost made steam come out of his ears. But there was other stuff. He could talk to Liz; he could listen to her. Wanted to listen to her. He could almost go into a trance when she told him about something as boring as algebra. If he had one drop of courage, he\u2019d ask Jack\u2014what is love and what is sex? When are they the same thing?</p><p>Finally he asked, \u201cAny news about being pregnant, Lizzie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I mean that.\u201d Silence answered him. She was going to make him say it, once again. Every time he asked, his gut clenched just from forming the words, words alien to a boy. \u201cDid you get your period?\u201d he asked, grateful she couldn\u2019t see the color of his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you really care about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I care about it a lot. Liz, baby, if I got you in trouble, I\u2019m gonna want to die, okay? I just want the scare over, that\u2019s all. For both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet\u2014but that\u2019s okay. I told you\u2014I\u2019m not regular. And I feel fine. I don\u2019t feel like anything\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s something,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cRicky, I miss you. Do you miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh, Liz,\u201d he said in an exhausted breath. \u201cI miss you so much it scares the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>Mel made a few phone calls the following week, then asked Jack if he could pry himself away from the bar for a full day to run some errands with her. She wanted to drive into Eureka, she said. And she didn\u2019t want to go alone. Of course he said he could\u2014he did anything she asked of him. He offered to drive, but she told him she\u2019d like to take her car, put the top down and enjoy the sunny June weather. When they were underway, she said, \u201cI hope this wasn\u2019t too presumptuous of me, Jack. I made myself an appointment at the beauty shop and one for you at the clinic\u2014</p><p>that testing you offered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to run over to the coast, to the Naval Air Station there, but this is just as convenient. I meant it when I offered. I want you to feel safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried, really. It\u2019s just a precaution. And if anything turns up, I\u2019ll get screened. I wouldn\u2019t put you at risk, you understand. But the last seven years, it was only...\u201d She stopped.</p><p>\u201cYour husband,\u201d he finished for her. \u201cYou can say it. That was your life. That is your life. We have to be able to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, gathering herself up again. \u201cThen, I\u2019ve made arrangements to testdrive a vehicle and I\u2019d like your opinion. A vehicle that doesn\u2019t get stuck in the mud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he said, surprised. \u201cWhat kind of vehicle?\u201d</p><p>She stole a glance at him, so neatly folded up in the front of her BMW, his knees sticking up so high it almost made her laugh. \u201cA Hummer,\u201d she said. He was speechless. Finally he said, \u201cI guess you know what they cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHope\u2019s paying you better than I would\u2019ve guessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope\u2019s paying me practically nothing\u2014but it also costs me practically nothing to live. Especially with that end-of-the-day cold beer on the house every night. No, this is my own investment.\u201d</p><p>He whistled.</p><p>\u201cI have a little money,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were...there was...\u201d</p><p>He reached across the console and put a hand on her thigh. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Mel. I didn\u2019t mean to pry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t pry!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cYou don\u2019t even ask, which is amazing to me. Here it is\u2014there were investments. Retirement. Insurance. I sold the house at a ridiculous profit. And then there was a wrongful death suit\u2014pending. It\u2019ll settle. The little scumbag came from money. Jack, I have plenty of money. More than I really need.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over at him. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate it if that went no further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one even knows you\u2019re widowed,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cSo\u2014I had a long talk with June Hudson, the doctor in Grace Valley. I asked her what she\u2019d do to turn an all-wheel-drive vehicle into a makeshift ambulance, and I have quite a shopping list. If it works out I\u2019ll have a vehicle that can not only get me and Doc all over valley and into the hills, but get our patients to the hospital when we need to, without me sitting in the back of a pickup, holding an IV</p><p>bag up in the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot to do for a little town like Virgin River,\u201d he said, and he said it very quietly.</p><p>He\u2019d done a lot for the little town, too, she thought. He renovated a cabin into a bar and grill, served meals at low prices all day long. Drinks were cheap and it served more as a gathering place than a profit-making establishment. He probably didn\u2019t need Ricky in there, but clearly he was a surrogate father. And Preacher\u2014there was no question he was looking out for him, as well. But then, it probably didn\u2019t take much for Jack to get by, either\u2014he\u2019d done most of the renovation work himself, collected a retirement from the military, and surely eked out a modest but completely adequate income from the place. And at the same time, enjoyed his life. Mainly what Jack did for the town was sit at the center of it, helping anyone who needed anything. Anyone who served the needs of the town, like Doc or Mel, and lately the occasional sheriff\u2019s deputy or highway patrol officer ate free. He\u2019d do repairs, babysit, deliver meals and absolutely never went for supplies without phoning up little old ladies like Frannie and Maud, to ask if they needed anything. He\u2019d done that with her, too. Behaved as though it was his mission to serve her needs.</p><p>\u201cThat little town has accidentally done a few things for me, too,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel like I might live after all. A lot of that is because of you, Jack.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Jack couldn\u2019t help himself. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the time being,\u201d she said. \u201cAnother baby is coming at the end of summer. I live for those babies.\u201d</p> <p>One of these days, he said to himself, I\u2019m going to tell her. Tell her I love her more than I thought I could love a woman. Tell her that my life started when she walked into town. But not yet. He didn\u2019t want to back her into a corner and make her feel she had to either say she loved him, too, or run.</p><p>\u201cWell, Mel, as it happens, I\u2019ve driven a ton of Hummers.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him with surprise, for she hadn\u2019t even thought of that. \u201cOf course you have!\u201d she said. \u201cI had forgotten that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m also a passably good mechanic. Born of necessity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood then,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be a bigger help than I realized.\u201d</p> <p>The first items on the agenda were her hair and his blood tests. Mel was very appreciative of the fact that her seventy-five-dollar cut and highlights seemed to be more than adequate. Either she\u2019d been countrified or ripped off in L.A. After that they went to a used car lot where there was one ridiculously high-priced used Hummer. It was a repo, had only twenty thousand miles on it, and seemed to be in good condition. Jack looked at the engine and had them put it up on the lift so he could examine the axle, frame, shocks, brakes and whatever else he could see. They took it out and it drove well, but the price was out-of-sight. Sixty thousand and it wasn\u2019t loaded.</p><p>Except\u2014Mel had a sweet little BMW convertible trade-in and cash. It took only a couple of hours to bring that price into range and Jack was able to pridefully explore another aspect of Mel\u2019s character\u2014she was a hardheaded, master negotiator. Next they went to the hospital supply where they had the back of the Hummer outfitted with some emergency equipment, from a defibrillator to an oxygen tank. Some medical supplies had to be ordered and would be delivered to Virgin River within a couple of weeks. Then they drove it back down the highway and up the mountain pass to Virgin River. \u201cYou don\u2019t want anyone to know where this came from,\u201d Jack said to Mel. \u201cHow are you going to explain it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to say that I used to work with a lot of rich, bored doctors in L.A. and hit them all up for donations for the town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you leave?\u201d He just couldn\u2019t make himself say \u201cwhen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll actually call some of those rich, bored doctors I really do know, and hit them up for a donation,\u201d she said. \u201cBut let\u2019s not put the cart before the Hummer.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cLet\u2019s not.\u201d</p> <p>Mel and Jack took the Hummer back to the bar where they did a little show-and-tell with the dinner crowd who would waste no time spreading the word to the rest of the town. Doc Mullins, as if he was annoyed by this unnecessary addition to the town, grumbled that his old truck had worked just fine. But Mel countered his comments by telling him that he would have to get checked out in the new vehicle the very next morning. It soon became apparent that his fit of pique was obviously contrived and he was even caught smiling once or twice as he looked it over. Ricky talked her out of a spin and Preacher stood on the porch, arms crossed over his massive chest, grinning like a schoolgirl.</p><p>When Mel called June Hudson the next morning to tell her about the new vehicle, June suggested they get together at her home the next Sunday for a casual dinner of burgers and hot dogs. \u201cIf I bring some potato salad and beer, may I bring a friend?\u201d</p><p>Mel asked. She told herself she asked because this little picnic was comprised of couples, except for June\u2019s dad, old Doc Hudson, and she didn\u2019t want to feel oddly alone. But really it was because she had found she didn\u2019t much like being away from Jack.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Jack said, grinning. \u201cAre you bringing me out of the closet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for the day,\u201d she answered. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve been very good.\u201d</p><p>June had the kind of adorable country house that Mel had fantasized about when planning her escape from the city\u2014wide porch, bright paint, cozy furnishings, right up on a knoll from which she had a view of the valley. Part of her decor was comprised of needlepoint pillows and quilts\u2014June was a master stitcher. She seemed to have the perfect country doctor life\u2014her husband Jim to back her up and help with the baby; an ornery father butting in all the time and supportive and delightful friends in John and Susan Stone.</p><p>Susan was a nurse, so she and Mel compared notes. Plus, Susan and John were transplants from the city and she was candid about how it took her a while to appreciate the slower pace and get used to the absence of amenities in Grace Valley.</p><p>\u201cI used to go to the day spa down the street for a facial and eyebrow wax,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cNow it\u2019s a major undertaking just to buy groceries.\u201d Susan was also very, very pregnant. She was continually pressing on her lower back, pushing her belly forward. The women sat on the porch. June rocked in the porch swing and nursed her baby, Susan fidgeted, trying to get a throw pillow to sit right against her lower back, while out in the yard the men stood around the Hummer, each one with a beer, occasionally looking inside or under the hood.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s quite an attractive man you brought along,\u201d June observed. Mel glanced out at them. Jim and Jack were about the same height and weight and both wore their uniforms of jeans, plaid or denim shirts and boots. John, just a bit shorter at a very respectable six feet, was not quite as casually dressed in his khakis and polo, but a damn fine specimen. \u201cLook at them,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThey look like an ad for Virility Magazine. Mother Nature\u2019s best work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother Nature is twisted,\u201d Susan said, squirming. \u201cIf she had any compassion, we\u2019d have six-week pregnancies.\u201d She winced. \u201cI bet it\u2019s really Father Nature. The creep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncomfortable, huh?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have back labor again, I just know it. It\u2019s such a nice day to be so pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is nice, June. Thank you,\u201d Mel said. \u201cIt\u2019s so relaxing, low stress, for me if not poor Susan. Does everybody in the valley have such simple, uncomplicated lives?\u201d</p><p>June surprised her by laughing, after which Susan joined in. Sydney, Susan\u2019s sevenyear-old, burst through the door, blond curls flying, and ran down the steps with Sadie, June\u2019s collie chasing her into the yard. She ran to her dad and hung on his leg for a minute, then continued racing around the yard with the dog in pursuit, the collie trying to herd her back to the group.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s funny?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cThings haven\u2019t exactly been uncomplicated around here. A couple of years ago I was pretty sure I\u2019d never get married, much less have a baby.\u201d</p><p>This caused Mel to scoot to the edge of her chair. \u201cIt seems like you and Jim have been together forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came into my clinic late at night a little over a year ago, looking for help with a comrade\u2019s gunshot wound. Jim\u2019s now a retired law enforcement officer. When I met him, though, he was skulking around the countryside, working some case\u2014and in the dark of night he\u2019d sneak into my bedroom. I kept him my little secret for quite a while\u2014until my tummy started to grow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. No one in town knew I even had a man in my life, and then suddenly I\u2019m pregnant. And not a little pregnant\u2014by the time I realized it, I was already pretty far along. We\u2019ve only been married a few months. We didn\u2019t get it done before the baby came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a small town like this?\u201d Mel was flabbergasted.</p><p>\u201cPeople were decent about it. I mean, we did have a flood, lost our preacher for a while, there was a huge drug raid out in the woods, one thing after another. And probably because they all took to Jim so quickly. But my dad almost had a stroke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe because Jim moved right into your house and wouldn\u2019t let you out of his sight until you agreed to marry him,\u201d Susan added.</p><p>\u201cI had been single a long time,\u201d June said. \u201cI was a little nervous about the whole thing. I mean, we hadn\u2019t even been together all that long\u2014and my God, not very often. I don\u2019t know how it happened,\u201d June said. \u201cBut it sure happened fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014you know how it happened,\u201d Susan said. \u201cThis,\u201d she said, petting the giant mound that would soon be screaming to be changed, \u201cis the great mystery. We had to try for a long time to get Sydney. We needed a little help, in fact. I just don\u2019t get pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Maybe in time Mel would join in, share her secrets. For now, though, she just wanted to hear theirs.</p><p>\u201cJohn and I were having a big fight,\u201d Susan said. \u201cWe were barely speaking. I had him sleeping on the couch\u2014he was such an ass. By the time I forgave him and let him back in bed with me, he was packing quite a punch.\u201d She giggled. Her eyes twinkled.</p><p>\u201cAt least you\u2019re married,\u201d June put in.</p><p>\u201cTell us about your man,\u201d Susan said.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack\u2019s not my man,\u201d she said automatically. \u201cHe is the first friend I made in Virgin River, however. He runs a little bar and grill across the street from Doc\u2019s\u2014as much a meeting place as a restaurant. They don\u2019t even have a menu\u2014his partner, a big scary-looking guy named Preacher who turns out to be an angel\u2014cooks up one breakfast item, one lunch item and one dinner item everyday. On an ambitious day, they might have two items\u2014maybe something left from the day before. They run it on the cheap, fish a lot, and help out around town wherever needed. He fixed up the cabin I was given to stay in while I\u2019m there.\u201d</p><p>The women didn\u2019t say anything for a moment. Then Susan said, \u201cHoney, I have a feeling he doesn\u2019t think of you as a friend. Have you seen the way he looks at you?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him and as if he could feel her gaze, he turned his eyes on her. Soft and hard all at once. \u201cYeah,\u201d Mel said. \u201cHe promised to stop doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirl, I\u2019d never make a man stop doing that to me! You can\u2019t possibly not know how much he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSusan,\u201d June said. \u201cWe don\u2019t mean to pry, Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJune doesn\u2019t mean to pry, but I do. You mean to say he hasn\u2019t...?\u201d</p><p>Mel felt her cheeks flame. \u201cWell, it isn\u2019t what you think,\u201d she said. June and Susan burst out laughing, loud enough to cause the men to turn away from their conversation and look up at the porch. Mel laughed in spite of herself. Ah, she had missed this\u2014girlfriends. Talking about the secret stuff, the private stuff. Laughing at their weaknesses and strengths.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Susan said. \u201cHe looks like he can\u2019t wait to get you alone. And do unspeakable things to you.\u201d</p><p>Mel sighed in spite of herself, her cheeks growing hotter. He can\u2019t, she almost said. And ohhhh...</p><p>June took the baby off her breast and put him on her shoulder to burp him. The group of men seemed to turn as one and head for the porch, Jim first. \u201cSounds like trouble up here,\u201d he said. He reached for the baby and took over the burping. John lowered his lips to Susan\u2019s forehead and gave her a kiss. His other hand ran smoothly over her belly. \u201cHow are you doing, honey?\u201d he asked solicitously.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Right after dinner, I want you to get it out of me.\u201d</p><p>He handed her his beer. \u201cHere, have a slug and mellow out.\u201d</p><p>Jack stood behind Mel and put his hand on her shoulder. Without even realizing it, she reached up and stroked his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll start the grill,\u201d old Doc Hudson said, going through the house. They all sat around a picnic table in the backyard, talking about their towns, their cases. Mel got some tips from John on home births\u2014he explained that he was an OB </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>before doing a second residency in family practice. He\u2019d never done a home birth in Sausalito, but once he\u2019d arrived in Grace Valley he\u2019d become the local midwife. He liked the hospital but couldn\u2019t convince all the women to leave their homes to deliver. Small-town stories were told, laughter was shared, and too soon it was growing dark. As Jack and Mel were leaving, Mel took an opportunity to speak with June about the baby\u2014Chloe. She expressed her concern that they still hadn\u2019t heard anything from social services.</p><p>June was frowning. \u201cIt\u2019s true that the county has a lot of ground to cover, but they\u2019re usually pretty good. One of my closest friends is a social worker, although she\u2019s in Mendocino county. I could run this by her\u2014get her impression.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you should. Especially if you think this is irregular,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it, and give you a call. Meanwhile, if you consider the baby your patient, you can assess the situation. See if you can find out anything. Doc Mullins is smarter than he lets on,\u201d June said. \u201cHe\u2019s a crafty old devil. Find out if he\u2019s got something up his sleeve.\u201d</p><p>Mel hugged June while Jack waited at the car. \u201cThank you. For everything. It was a perfect day.\u201d</p><p>Driving back to Virgin River, Mel was lost in one of the most serene moods she\u2019d felt in a long time. Her connection to this place had deepened with the new friendships, and no small part of that was their acceptance of Jack.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully quiet,\u201d Jack observed.</p> <p>\u201cI had such a good time,\u201d she said dreamily.</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Nice people, your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey liked you, too. Did you know that Jim is a former cop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got that, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd John and Susan came up here from the city a couple of years ago. And Elmer\u2014</p><p>the old doc\u2014he\u2019s a riot. I\u2019m so glad we did that.\u201d</p> <p>They drove in companionable silence until they neared Virgin River. Jack said, \u201cWhat do you want to do tonight? My place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you be terribly hurt if we took a night off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you need, Mel. Just so long as nothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. In fact, I\u2019ve never felt more right with the world. I just thought I\u2019d go home, shower off the picnic and get a good night\u2019s sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d He reached across the front seat and grabbed her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s always up to you.\u201d He drew her hand to his lips and pressed a soft kiss into her palm. He pulled up to the bar and they traded places so she could drive home. After a kiss good-night, she left him there and went out to the cabin.</p><p>As she entered the clearing in front of her home, the first thing she noticed was a big, dark SUV parked in front of her cabin. The driver, the big nameless man with the ball cap and hair that curled beneath it was leaning against the passenger door. When she pulled up, he straightened and slipped his thumbs in his front pockets. She recognized him and the vehicle at once. This was the big guy who\u2019d stopped by Doc\u2019s several weeks ago, and what flashed through her mind was \u201csomeone\u2019s pregnant.\u201d Then she took note of his sidearm\u2014a big gun, with straps holding the holster to his thigh. But his hands stayed away from it.</p><p>In a place like this, she was never sure how to feel about a person toting weapons. If she\u2019d seen this in the city, she\u2019d have ducked for cover. But out here, it didn\u2019t necessarily mean anything. She could play it safe and make a run for it, though she didn\u2019t handle the Hummer so well yet. Besides, the man had already approached her in the clear light of day to ask about a delivery. She pulled up, keeping her headlights on him, and he seemed to straighten expectantly, stepping away from the SUV. She opened her door and stepped out. \u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat baby\u2019s coming,\u201d he said.</p> <p>No matter what the circumstances, the same thing seemed to happen to her when she heard that\u2014she stopped thinking of herself and began to concentrate on the work at hand, the mother and child. \u201cThat was pretty quick,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo. I was pretty slow,\u201d he said. \u201cShe kept it to herself for a long time and I didn\u2019t realize she was this ready, this\u2014look, I need you to come. To help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why are you here? Why didn\u2019t you go into town, to the doctor\u2019s office? I almost didn\u2019t come home tonight...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for me you did. I couldn\u2019t go to town, couldn\u2019t run the risk of someone wanting to come with you, or someone telling you not to come with me. Please, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll follow you. I\u2019ll just go inside, make a call and\u2014\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward her. \u201cWe can\u2019t do it that way. It\u2019ll be better for all of us if you don\u2019t know exactly where you are. And really, it has to be just you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, gimme a break,\u201d she said with a short laugh. \u201cYou expect me to get in that car with you? Without knowing you or where we\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the general idea, yeah,\u201d he said. \u201cShe thinks she\u2019s doing this alone, having the baby. But I\u2019d rather you come with me, in case...What if there\u2019s a problem? Huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can call Doc Mullins, maybe he\u2019ll go with you. I don\u2019t make a habit of getting in a vehicle with a stranger to be driven to some mysterious birthing...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I wish it was mysterious. I wish it wasn\u2019t happening, but it is. I don\u2019t want to have to do this at all\u2014but I also don\u2019t want anything stupid to go wrong that we could prevent. I don\u2019t want any unnecessary trouble. You should probably be there. In case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis your baby?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYeah, could be. Probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know there is a baby coming. I\u2019ve never seen the mother,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cWhat if there is no baby?\u201d she said.</p><p>He took a tentative step toward her. \u201cWhat if there is?\u201d he asked. She looked around her. It was obvious if he wanted to hurt her, he wouldn\u2019t need to take her anywhere. He wouldn\u2019t even need to draw that weapon. They were completely isolated. He could take ten short steps toward her, whack her across the jaw and it would be done.</p><p>He spread his arms wide. \u201cI just have to keep the place covered. It\u2019s a place of business, all right? Could we please go get that baby born? I\u2019m not kidding, it freaks me out. She says she\u2019s been hurting all day. And there\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a lot? Not puddles, but enough to make me get in the truck and come for you. Pronto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a gun,\u201d she pointed out to him. \u201cI hate guns.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a hand along the back of his neck. \u201cProtection for you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just a businessman, but there\u2019s some crazy people stuck out there in the woods. I\u2019m not going to let anything happen to you\u2014that would make my life way too complicated. I don\u2019t want any attention from the sheriff. We really gotta go. There\u2019s a baby coming. Real soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing something to you? I\u2019m asking. That\u2019s all. I want to get a baby born without anything stupid and wrong happening to the baby or the mother. Get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just take her to the hospital?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cShe works for me, okay? And she has warrants. They ID her at a hospital and she\u2019s going to jail. You can\u2019t take care of a baby from jail. That\u2019s why it\u2019s gotta be this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, go get her and take her to town, to Doc\u2019s. We\u2019ll do it there and no one will ask any questions about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, there isn\u2019t time!\u201d he shouted. The look on his face was desperate and he took a pleading step toward her, arms wide, palms out. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna happen soon, and we\u2019re almost an hour from her! We might not make it as it is!\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cWe should take the Hummer...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cCan\u2019t leave my vehicle here in case someone comes looking for you and finds only my truck. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my bag,\u201d Mel said, reluctantly.</p><p>She grabbed her bag out of the Hummer and got in his SUV. He held a black sash in his hand. \u201cYou should blindfold,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGet real,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019m not doing that. Hurry up. If she\u2019s been hurting all day, just hurry up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut it on. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I won\u2019t see what? Where we\u2019re headed? I\u2019m from L.A., buddy. I\u2019ve been here three months and I can hardly get myself to town in the daylight along these mountain roads. It\u2019s pitch black. Just move it\u2014I\u2019m never going to be able to tell anyone where we went.\u201d And more softly, \u201cBesides, I wouldn\u2019t. The only thing that would make me do that is if I needed to find you, or her, to save a life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis some kind of trick?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Now stop scaring me. I might panic and throw myself out of the car, and then where would you be?\u201d</p><p>He put the SUV in gear and peeled out of the drive and headed east. \u201cI hope you\u2019re not lying to me, setting me up. Because after this is taken care of, you don\u2019t have to see me again. Unless...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSetting you up?\u201d She laughed. \u201cDid I come to your house? You want to just get this baby born on your own?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI never did anything like this before,\u201d he said, his voice solemn and serious. \u201cIf I\u2019d known there was a baby coming, I would\u2019ve taken her somewhere. Somewhere out of this county. But I didn\u2019t know. Just do your thing, I\u2019ll pay you, and we\u2019ll be done. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be done?\u201d she asked. \u201cThese babies that no one expects? Sometimes they last about ninety years! After labor and delivery, there\u2019s stuff to do! Children to raise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, tiredly. Focused on the road he whirled the SUV around the tight turns, gunned the engine when the road was straight. But the straightaways were short, always followed by more tight turns. Most of the time the speedometer read about twenty miles per hour. He used not only his headlights, but the lights mounted on his roof. It was a long, silent spell before he said, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of what they need. After the baby\u2019s here, when she\u2019s up to it, there\u2019s a sister she can go to in Nevada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s this all so secret?\u201d Mel asked. She looked at his profile and saw him grin largely. He had a slight bump in his nose. Under the bill of his ball cap his eyes crinkled when he smiled like that, and she noted that while he was rugged and scruffy, he was not unattractive.</p><p>\u201cJesus, you\u2019re something, you know that? Just go with it, little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know where I live?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t think you\u2019re hiding out there, miss. Because everyone knows where the new midwife lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, great,\u201d she said under her breath. \u201cThat\u2019s just great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. Nobody wants you hurt or anything. That would just bring a whole heap of trouble on a whole lot of people.\u201d He stole a glance at her. \u201cSomeone like you goes missing, three counties go tearing up the hills. That\u2019s bad for business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI guess I should be honored.\u201d She looked over at him. \u201cWhy am I not feeling so honored yet?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI guess this is all new to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cBoy howdy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>They rode silently for a while, twisting around the mountain roads, up and over, down and around. \u201cHow\u2019d you get yourself into this mess?\u201d she asked him. He shrugged. \u201cJust one of those things. Let\u2019s not talk about this anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe better be okay,\u201d Mel said.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. Jesus, she better be okay.\u201d</p><p>Mel thought again about all the help available in a big city\u2014lots of people. Not the least of whom was law enforcement\u2014real handy. Cops parked right inside the hospital all the time. Right now, it was just her. Before her, it had been just Doc. If a woman was having a baby out in the middle of nowhere and there was only one midwife in the area, what were the options?</p><p>Mel began to tremble. What if they were too late and something wasn\u2019t right\u2014what if things turned nasty?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how long they\u2019d been on the road. Definitely over a half hour. Maybe forty-five minutes. The man took a left turn down a one-lane dirt road that seemed to stop at a dead end. He got out and pushed open what appeared to be a gate made entirely of bushes and they drove through, down a potholed, washboard road thickly enshrouded by big trees. At the end, the powerful lights on the roof of his SUV</p><p>illuminated a small building and an even smaller trailer. There were lights on inside the trailer.</p> <p>\u201cThis it is. She\u2019s in there,\u201d he said, pointing at the small trailer. That\u2019s when she knew, and was amazed that she hadn\u2019t understood sooner. She\u2014who was so cynical about the crusty side of big city medicine\u2014was totally naive about the pretty mountains and what she had thought was benign small-town life. The house and trailer were buried beneath the trees, camouflaged by the tall pines, and right between the two was a generator. This was why everything was so secret, why there was a gun for protection\u2014he was a grower. Further, this was the reason he\u2019d hire someone to work for him who had felony warrants, the only kind that could get you sent straight to jail\u2014because that\u2019s who you could get to sit out in the woods and watch over a crop like this.</p><p>\u201cIs she alone in there?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen I need your help. I\u2019ll need you to get me some things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any part of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better just do as I say, if we\u2019re going to salvage this situation,\u201d she said, her voice sounding more authoritative than she felt inside. She rushed to the trailer, opened the door, stepped up and in. Five steps took her through a little galley and into what passed for a bedroom, a berth, upon which a young woman writhed beneath a sheet soiled with blood and fluids.</p> <p>Mel put a knee on the bed, placed her bag beside her knee and opened it, dropped her jacket off her shoulders onto the floor behind her, and there was a transformation within her, taking her from scared and uncertain to driven and focused. Confident.</p><p>\u201cEasy does it,\u201d she said gently. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look.\u201d Over her shoulder she said, \u201cI need a large, empty pan or bowl, some towels or blankets\u2014soft as possible\u2014for the baby. A pan of warm water for cleanup. Ah...\u201d she said, lifting the sheet. \u201cAll right, sweetheart, you have to help me. Pant like this,\u201d she instructed, demonstrating while she put on her gloves. \u201cNo pushing. More light!\u201d she yelled over her shoulder. The baby was crowning; another five minutes and Mel would have missed the whole thing. She heard the man moving around behind her and suddenly a saucepan appeared beside her bag. Then there were a couple of towels and an overhead light flicked on. Mel made a mental note to add a flashlight to the articles in her bag. The woman grunted weakly and the baby\u2019s head emerged. \u201cPant,\u201d Mel instructed.</p><p>\u201cDo not push\u2014we have a cord situation. Easy, easy...\u201d She gently tugged on the ropey, purplish cord, pulling it from around the neck, freeing the baby. She hadn\u2019t been in the trailer for five minutes, but it was the most critical few minutes of this infant\u2019s life. She slipped a gloved finger into the birth canal and gently eased the baby toward her. Cries filled the room before the baby was completely born; the strong, healthy cries of a newborn. Her heart lifted in relief; this was a strong baby. Suction was not even necessary.</p><p>\u201cYou have a son,\u201d she said softly. \u201cHe looks beautiful.\u201d She looked over the raised knees of her patient and saw a young woman of perhaps twenty-five years at most, her long, dark hair damp from perspiration, her black eyes tired but glowing, and a very small smile on her lips. Mel clamped and cut the cord, wrapped the baby and made her way around the narrow space to the woman\u2019s head. \u201cLet\u2019s put this baby on the breast,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThen I can deal with the placenta.\u201d The woman reached for her baby. Mel noticed that sitting beside her on the bed was a large basket, ready to receive the baby. \u201cThis is not your first,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>She shook her head and a large tear spilled down her cheek as she took her son.</p><p>\u201cThird,\u201d she said in a whisper. \u201cI don\u2019t have the other ones.\u201d</p><p>Mel brushed the damp hair back from her brow. \u201cHave you been out here alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the last month or so. I was here with someone, and he left.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLeft you, out in the woods in a trailer, in advanced pregnancy?\u201d Mel asked softly, running a finger over the baby\u2019s perfect head. \u201cYou must have been so scared. Come on,\u201d she said, giving the woman\u2019s T-shirt a tug. \u201cLet the baby nurse. It\u2019ll make a lot of things feel better.\u201d The infant rooted a little bit, then found the nipple and suckled. Mel went back to her position, donned fresh gloves from her bag and began to massage the uterus. She heard the trailer door close behind her and glanced over her shoulder. On the short counter in the galley she saw a dishpan of water. Mel\u2019s patient was able to direct her to supplies from newborn diapers to sterile wipes. She found clean sheets and peri-pads, washed up the baby and mother, then sat on the edge of the bed for a long while, holding the baby. Her patient reached over and held Mel\u2019s hand a couple of times, giving a grateful squeeze, but they didn\u2019t talk. An hour after the birth, Mel looked in the refrigerator. She rummaged around for a glass and poured the woman some juice. Then she brought a plastic container of water near the bed. She checked her patient\u2019s bleeding, which was normal. She got her stethoscope out of the bag and listened to the baby\u2019s heart, then the mother\u2019s. Coloring was good, respirations normal, mother exhausted and the baby, sleeping contentedly. All was complete.</p><p>\u201cTell me something,\u201d Mel said. \u201cIs the baby going to have drug issues?\u201d The woman just shook her head, letting her eyes close. \u201cAll right\u2014there\u2019s a small clinic in Virgin River. I work with the doctor there. He won\u2019t ask you about yourself or the baby, so you have nothing to worry about. He likes to say he\u2019s in medicine, not law enforcement. But you both should be looked at to be sure everything is okay.\u201d</p><p>Mel picked up her jacket off the floor. \u201cIs there anything else I can get for you?\u201d she asked her patient. The woman shook her head. \u201cPlenty of fluids tonight, for the breast milk.\u201d Then she went around the narrow space to the head of the bed and leaned down, placing a small kiss on her head. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d she whispered. Then wiped a couple of tears gently from her patient\u2019s cheeks. \u201cI hope everything works out for you and the baby. Be very safe and careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d the woman said softly. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t come...\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhhh,\u201d Mel shushed. \u201cI came. And you\u2019re fine.\u201d</p><p>Mel realized, not for the first time, that it didn\u2019t matter if her patient was a happily married Sunday-school teacher who\u2019d been waiting years for her first baby, or a felon handcuffed to the bed\u2014a birth was the great equalizer. In this vulnerable state, mothers were mothers, and it was her passion to serve them. Helping a baby safely into the world, its mother accomplishing the experience with health and dignity, was the only thing that mattered. Even if it meant putting herself at some risk, she was bound to do what she could. She couldn\u2019t control what became of a mother and child after she left them, but when called upon for this, she was unable to refuse. Her chauffeur was waiting at the SUV as she came out. He opened the passenger door for her. \u201cThey\u2019re okay?\u201d he asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cThey seem to have come through very well, considering. I guess you don\u2019t live there with them?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t see she was pregnant. I only come around sometimes and I dealt mostly with her man. I guess he left her when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he realized you\u2019d dealt with her a little, too?\u201d Mel finished for him. She shook her head and got into the car. When he was in beside her she said, \u201cI want two things from you, and the way I see it, you owe me. I want you to go back there tonight, stay with them, so you can get them to the hospital if anything goes south in the night. If there\u2019s any real heavy bleeding, or if the baby has problems. Don\u2019t panic\u2014they seem good\u2014but if you don\u2019t want to take any unnecessary chances, that\u2019s what you do. Then, in a couple of days, two to four days, bring them to the clinic to be checked over. Doctor Mullins in Virgin River won\u2019t ask any questions, and all I care about right now is that they stay healthy.\u201d She looked over at him. \u201cYou\u2019ll do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it done,\u201d he said.</p><p>She leaned her head back against the seat and let her eyes close. The hard and fast beating of her heart now was not from fear, but from the rapid decompression of adrenaline that always followed an emergency. It left her feeling weak, a little shaky, slightly nauseous. If the conditions had been different, she might have felt even more alive than before the birth. This one, however, had been rife with complications. When he pulled up in front of her cabin, he held out a wad of bills toward her. \u201cI don\u2019t want your money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s drug money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuit yourself,\u201d he said, putting it in the front pocket of his jacket. She stared at him for a second. \u201cIf you\u2019d left her to deliver herself, if I hadn\u2019t gone with you, that baby wouldn\u2019t have\u2014You understand about the cord, right? Wrapped around his neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost didn\u2019t go with you. Really, there\u2019s no reason I should have trusted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You\u2019re a brave little girl. Try to forget my face. For your own sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, I\u2019m in medicine, I\u2019m not a cop,\u201d she said. Then she gave a weak huff of laughter. She\u2019d been used to having the backup of L.A.P.D., but tonight it had been down to her. There was no backup. And if she hadn\u2019t been there, it could have been down to Doc, who was seventy. What was going to happen five years from now? To her chauffeur she said, \u201cNow keep it in your pants or use protection\u2014I don\u2019t really feel like doing business with you again.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cTough little broad, aren\u2019tcha? Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not looking to have that kind of trouble again.\u201d</p><p>She got out of the SUV without comment and walked toward her porch. By the time she neared her front door, he had turned around and driven out of the clearing. She sank into the porch chair and sat in the dark. The night sounds echoed around her; crickets, an occasional owl, wind whirring through the tall pines. She wished she could just go inside, undress and go to bed alone, but she was wired and out of courage for the night. After a moment, when she could no longer hear the engine of his big SUV, she went down the stairs to the Hummer. She drove into town and parked behind the bar, next to Jack\u2019s truck. The sound of the engine and car door must have awakened him, because a light went on and the back door to his quarters opened. He stood in the frame, a dim light behind him, wearing a pair of hastily pulled on jeans. She walked right into his arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked softly, pulling her inside and closing the door.</p><p>\u201cI went out on a call. A baby. And I didn\u2019t want to go home. Didn\u2019t want to be alone after that. It was a close one, Jack.\u201d</p> <p>He slipped his hands inside her jacket to hold her closer. \u201cDid everything work out okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there wasn\u2019t very much time. If I\u2019d been five minutes longer getting there...The cord was around his neck.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut I did get there. And he\u2019s a beautiful baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he asked, smoothing her hair over her ear.</p><p>\u201cThe other side of Clear River,\u201d she said, remembering what the man had said when he pulled up to the front of Doc\u2019s clinic. In truth, she had no idea where they\u2019d gone. He could\u2019ve driven around in circles for all she knew.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trembling,\u201d he said, pressing his lips to her brow.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, a little. Coming down from the experience.\u201d She tilted her head to look up at him. \u201cIs it okay that I\u2019m here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. Mel, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mother was going to deliver herself, but the father got nervous and came for me.\u201d She shivered. \u201cI thought I had some wild experiences in L.A.,\u201d she said with a weak laugh. \u201cIf you\u2019d told me a year ago that I\u2019d go out to some poor trailer in the woods, in the middle of the night to deliver a baby, I would have said, never gonna happen.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed a knuckle along her cheek. \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. If she told him she didn\u2019t have the first idea, he\u2019d flip. \u201cThey\u2019re not from around here, Jack. He dropped by Doc\u2019s a while ago, looking for someone who could handle a birth. I can\u2019t talk about patients unless they say it\u2019s okay, but these patients, I didn\u2019t even ask. They weren\u2019t married or anything. She lives in a crappy little trailer by herself. It\u2019s a pretty horrid situation for her.\u201d And she thought, I\u2019m doing things out here in the mountains that I never, in a million years, thought I could do. Terrifying, impossible, dangerous things. Exhilarating things that no one else would do. And if no one had, there\u2019d be a dead baby. Possibly a critical mother. She leaned her head against Jack\u2019s chest and took a deep, steadying breath.</p><p>\u201cHe called you?\u201d Jack asked.</p> <p>Damn. Bold-faced lies to straight questions were so hard for her. \u201cHe was waiting at the cabin. If I\u2019d stayed the night here with you, I\u2019d have missed him and that baby wouldn\u2019t have made it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell him where to find you after hours?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head before she thought about her answer. \u201cHe must have asked someone,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone in Virgin River knows where I live. And probably half the people in Clear River.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said, tightening his arms around her. \u201cDid it ever occur to you that you could have been at risk?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cFor a minute or two,\u201d she said. She looked up at him and smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t expect you to understand this\u2014but there was a baby coming. And I\u2019m glad I went. Besides, I wasn\u2019t in trouble. The mother was.\u201d</p><p>He let out a slow, relieved breath. \u201cJesus. I\u2019m going to have to keep a much closer eye on you.\u201d He kissed her brow. \u201cSomething happened tonight. Something you\u2019re not telling me. Whatever it was\u2014never, never let that happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we get in bed, please? I really need you to hold me.\u201d</p><p>Jack was sitting on the porch of the bar, tying off flies, when a familiar black Range Rover pulled slowly into town and parked right in front of Doc\u2019s. He sat forward on the porch chair and watched as the driver got out, went around to the passenger door and opened it. A woman carrying a small bundle got out of the car, walked up the porch steps to enter the clinic and Jack\u2019s heart began to pound. When the woman entered Doc\u2019s, the man went back to his SUV and leaned against the hood, his back to Jack. He took out a small pen knife and began to idly clean under his nails. Because of the kind of guy this was, Jack knew he had seen him sitting there, on the porch. He would have observed everything worth seeing when he came into town; he\u2019d know every escape route, any threat. Today, coming into town with a woman and new baby, Jack would bet there wouldn\u2019t be contraband of any kind in that vehicle and if he had weapons, they\u2019d be registered. And...his license plate was splattered with mud so it couldn\u2019t be read. Lame trick. But Jack remembered it; he\u2019d memorized it the first time this guy had come to town. So, he hadn\u2019t come to Virgin River for a couple of drinks a while back. He\u2019d come to see if there was medical assistance here. Mel had said that the delivery that shook her up had occurred on the other side of Clear River and there was no doctor or clinic in that town. Grace Valley and Garberville were just a little farther away, but there were more people around.</p> <p>It was a little over a half hour before the woman came out, Mel walking behind her. The woman turned and shook Mel\u2019s hand; Mel squeezed her upper arm. The man helped her into the car and drove slowly out of town.</p><p>Jack stood and Mel met his eyes across the street. They were on their respective porches and, even from the distance, she could see the deepening frown gather on his face. Then he walked over to her.</p><p>She slipped her hands into the pockets of her jeans as he approached. When he was near, he put one foot up on the porch steps and leaned his forearms on his bent knee, looking up at her. The frown was not angry, but definitely unhappy. \u201cDoc know what you did?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>She gave a nod. \u201cHe knows I delivered a baby, if that\u2019s what you mean. It\u2019s what I do, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to promise me, you\u2019re not going to do that again. Not for someone like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. But he\u2019s been in the bar and I know what he is. The problem isn\u2019t him bringing a woman to the doctor, you know. It\u2019s you being on his turf. It\u2019s you going with him in the middle of the night. Alone. Just because he says\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t threatened,\u201d she said. \u201cI was asked. And he had been by the clinic before, looking for a doctor, so he wasn\u2019t a complete stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me,\u201d Jack said firmly. \u201cPeople like that aren\u2019t going to threaten you in your clinic or my bar. They like to keep a real low profile. They don\u2019t want their crops raided. But out there,\u201d he said, giving his chin a jerk toward the mountains to their east, \u201cthings can happen. He could\u2019ve decided you were a threat to his business and\u2014</p><p>\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to me. That would be a threat to his business\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what he told you? Because I wouldn\u2019t take his word for that.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that, Melinda. You can\u2019t go alone to some illegal grower\u2019s camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt there will be a situation like that again,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cPromise you won\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI have a job to do, Jack. If I hadn\u2019t gone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel, do you understand what I\u2019m telling you? I\u2019m not going to lose you because you\u2019re willing to take stupid chances. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips and merely lifted her chin defiantly. \u201cNever...never suggest I\u2019m stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that. But you have to understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was down to me. There was a baby coming, there really was, and I had to go because if I hadn\u2019t it could\u2019ve been disastrous. There wasn\u2019t time to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you always been this stubborn?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThere was a baby coming. And it doesn\u2019t matter to me who the woman is or what she does for a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have done something like that in L.A.?\u201d he asked, lifting an eyebrow. She thought for just a moment about how life had changed since leaving L.A. After being picked up by a gun-carrying illegal grower and delivering a baby back in the woods, shouldn\u2019t she be packing? Running for her life? Unwilling to ever be put in a position like that again? Instead, she was doing a mental inventory of what was in Doc\u2019s refrigerator, wondering if it wasn\u2019t about time to take a few things out to Paulis\u2019s camp. It had been a couple of weeks since she\u2019d last done that. Although she really didn\u2019t want a repeat of the scenario with the grower, something about the experience got her attention. When she\u2019d left L.A., they didn\u2019t have any trouble filling her job. There were ten people who could do what she did, and do it just as well. In Virgin River, and the surrounding area, it was her and Doc. There just wasn\u2019t anyone else. There was no day off or week off. And if she had hesitated even long enough to fetch Doc to go with her, that baby wouldn\u2019t have made it. I came here because I thought life would be simpler, easier, quieter, she thought. That there would be fewer challenges, and certainly nothing to fear. I thought I\u2019d feel safer, not that I\u2019d have to grow stronger. Braver.</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cIn L.A. we send the paramedics. You see any paramedics? I\u2019m in this little town that you said was uncomplicated. You\u2019re a big liar, that\u2019s what you are...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, we have our own kind of drama. Mel, you should listen to me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a real complicated place sometimes. I\u2019m just going to do my job the best I can.\u201d</p><p>He stepped up onto the porch, put a finger under her chin and lifted it, gazing into her eyes. \u201cMelinda, you\u2019re getting to be a real handful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d she asked, smiling. \u201cSo are you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Mel didn\u2019t tell Doc where she was going, just that there were a couple of people she wanted to look in on. He asked her, since she was out, to stop and check on Frannie Butler, an elderly woman who lived alone and had high blood pressure. \u201cMake sure she has plenty of medicine and that she\u2019s actually taking it,\u201d he said. He popped an antacid.</p><p>\u201cShould you be having so much heartburn?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cEveryone my age has this much heartburn,\u201d he answered, brushing her off. Mel got Frannie\u2019s blood pressure out of the way first, though it wasn\u2019t quick. The thing about house calls in little towns like this was it involved tea and cookies and conversation. It was as much a social event as medical care. Then she drove out to the Anderson ranch. When she pulled up, Buck came out of the shed with a shovel in his hand and an astonished look on his face when he saw the Hummer. \u201cWhoee,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhen did that thing turn up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust last week,\u201d she said. \u201cBetter for getting around the back roads than my little foreign job, as Doc calls it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind if I have a look?\u201d he asked, peering into the window.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself. I\u2019d like to check on Chloe. Lilly inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. In the kitchen. Go on in\u2014door\u2019s open.\u201d And he immediately stuck his head in the driver\u2019s door, taken with the vehicle.</p><p>Mel went around back. Through the kitchen window she could see Lilly\u2019s profile as she sat at the kitchen table. The door was open and only the screen door was closed. She gave a couple of quick raps, called out, \u201cHey, Lilly,\u201d and opened the door. And was stopped dead in her tracks.</p><p>Lilly, too late, pulled the baby blanket over her exposed breast. She was nursing Chloe.</p><p>Mel was frozen in place. \u201cLilly?\u201d she said, confused.</p><p>Tears sprang to the woman\u2019s eyes. \u201cMel,\u201d she said, her voice a mere whisper. The baby immediately started to whimper and Lilly tried to comfort her, but Chloe wasn\u2019t done nursing. Lilly\u2019s cheeks were instantly red and damp; the hands that fussed with her shirt and held the baby were shaking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d Mel asked, completely confused. Lilly\u2019s youngest child was grown\u2014she couldn\u2019t possibly have breast milk. But then she realized what had happened. \u201cOh, my God!\u201d Chloe was Lilly\u2019s baby! Mel walked slowly to the kitchen table and pulled out a chair to sit down because her knees were shaking. \u201cDoes everyone in the family know?\u201d</p><p>Lilly shook her head, her eyes pinched closed. \u201cJust me and Buck,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in my right mind.\u201d</p> <p>Mel shook her head, baffled. \u201cLilly. What in the world happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought they\u2019d come for her\u2014the county. And that someone would want her right off. Some nice young couple who couldn\u2019t have a baby. Then she\u2019d have young parents and I\u2014\u201d she shook her head pitifully. \u201cI just didn\u2019t think I could do it again,\u201d</p><p>she said, dissolving into sobs.</p><p>Mel got out of her chair and went to her, taking the fussing baby, trying to comfort her. Lilly lay her head down on the table top and wept hard tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so ashamed,\u201d she cried. When she looked up at Mel again she said, \u201cI raised six kids. I spent thirty years raising kids and we got seven grandkids. I couldn\u2019t imagine another one. So late in my life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWasn\u2019t there anyone you could talk to about this?\u201d Mel asked. She shook her head. \u201cMel,\u201d she wept. \u201cCountry people...Small-town country people know that once you talk about it...No,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI was sick when I realized I was pregnant and forty-eight years old. I was sick and a little crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever consider terminating the pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but I couldn\u2019t. I just couldn\u2019t. I make no judgment, but it isn\u2019t in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about arranging an adoption?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one in this family, in this town for that matter, would ever understand that. They\u2019d have looked at me like I killed her. Even my friends\u2014good women my age who would understand how I felt, could never accept it if I said I didn\u2019t want to raise another child, my own child. I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now what do you intend to do?\u201d Mel asked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she wailed. \u201cI just don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they come now\u2014social services? Lilly, can you give her up?\u201d</p><p>She was shaking her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so. Oh, God, I wish I had a chance to do it over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLilly\u2014how did you conceal your pregnancy? How did you give birth alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one pays much attention\u2014I\u2019m overweight. Buck helped. Poor Buck\u2014he didn\u2019t even know till it was almost time\u2014I kept it from him, too. Maybe we can adopt her now?\u201d</p><p>Mel sat down again, still jiggling the baby. She looked down at Chloe, who was burying her fist in her mouth, squirming and fussing. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to adopt her, you gave birth to her. But I\u2019m awful worried about you. You abandoned her. That must have almost killed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched the whole time. Till you and Jack came to the porch. I wouldn\u2019t let anything happen to her. It was terrible hard, but I felt like I had to. I just didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lilly,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you\u2019re okay yet. This is just too crazy.\u201d She passed the baby back to Lilly. \u201cHere, nurse your baby. She\u2019s hungry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that I can,\u201d she said, but she took the baby. \u201cI might be too upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hook her up\u2014she\u2019ll do the work,\u201d Mel said. When the baby was again at the breast, Mel put her arms around Lilly and just held them both for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Lilly asked, her voice a quivering mess.</p><p>\u201cGod, Lilly, I don\u2019t know. Do you understand that doctors and midwives protect your confidentiality? If I\u2019d been here when you\u2019d discovered your pregnancy, you could have trusted me with your secret. You could have trusted Doc, or Dr. Stone in Grace Valley. The people in the family planning clinic keep confidential records\u2014they would have helped. But...\u201d She took a breath. \u201cWe\u2019re also bound by laws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just didn\u2019t know where to turn.\u201d</p><p>Mel shook her head sadly. \u201cYou must have been so scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t ever been through anything as difficult in my life, Mel. And me and Buck, we\u2019ve had some real hard times holding this family and ranch together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you keep the breast-feeding from your kids? I assume they\u2019re around quite a bit\u2014and don\u2019t your boys work the ranch with Buck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI give her a bottle if anyone\u2019s around, and I nurse her when we\u2019re alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though you planned to let her go, you nursed her? You didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>Lilly shrugged. \u201cIt seemed like the least I could give her, after what I did. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so, so sorry. You just don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like\u2014spending your whole life raising kids\u2014and then having another one on the way when you\u2019re a grandmother. Me and Buck\u2014we\u2019ve struggled with money our entire marriage! You just don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lilly, I know you were terrified and desperate. I can imagine. But I\u2019m not going to kid you, this is complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut will you help us? Will you help Chloe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do what I can\u2014but those laws...\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I can,\u201d she said gently. \u201cWe\u2019ll find a way to sort this out. Just let me think.\u201d</p><p>Not long after, when Mel was sure that Lilly was calmed down and safe, Mel left her. She\u2019d been with her about forty minutes, but Buck was still combing the Hummer with envious eyes. \u201cHelluva ride, Mel,\u201d he said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cBuck, go in the house and comfort your wife. I just walked in on her nursing your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boy,\u201d he said.</p><p>It was on the ride back to town that Mel realized Doc Mullins was onto this. In fact, he might\u2019ve given birth to it, so to speak. He\u2019d always said the mother would turn up, and she had. Weeks ago when Mel had told him that Lilly had offered to take in the baby, his eyebrows had shot up in surprise. He hadn\u2019t expected it to be Lilly. He had never called social services. And yet, he never brought her into the conspiracy. By the time she got back to his house it was after four and she was steamed up pretty good. Doc was seeing a patient who was coughing and hacking like a dying man. She had to wait. And while she waited, she began to seethe. When the man finally left with a butt full of penicillin and a pocket full of pills, she faced him down. \u201cYour office,\u201d she said flatly, preceding him in that direction.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got your dander up?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI went to the Andersons\u2019. I walked in on Lilly nursing the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said simply, limping around her to sit behind his desk, his arthritis obviously kicking up again.</p><p>She leaned her hands on the desk and got in his face. \u201cYou never called social services.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t see the need. Her mother came for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do about the birth certificate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when we get this straightened out a little better, I\u2019ll sign and date it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoc, you can\u2019t pull this shit! That baby was abandoned! Even though her mother came back for her, it might still be considered a crime!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettle down. Lilly was a little overwrought is all. She\u2019s fine now\u2014I\u2019ve been keeping an eye on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the very least, you could have told me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have you go off half-cocked like this? Snatch up that baby and turn her in? That woman was at the end of her rope\u2014and turned out all she needed was a little time to cool down, come to her senses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe should\u2019ve seen a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Lilly had all her kids at home. She\u2019d have come in if she was sick. Fact is, if Lilly had turned up any sooner\u2014I\u2019d have insisted on examining her, just to be safe. By the time she came around, it was obvious she was in good health.\u201d</p><p>Mel fumed. \u201cI can\u2019t work like this,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m here to give good, sound medical care, not run around in circles trying to guess what you\u2019re dreaming up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho asked ya?\u201d he threw back.</p><p>She was stunned quiet for a moment. Then she said, \u201cShit!\u201d And she turned to leave his office.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not done here,\u201d he bellowed. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a beer!\u201d she yelled back.</p><p>When she got to Jack\u2019s it was impossible for her to hide the fact that she was all riled up, but she couldn\u2019t talk about it. She went straight to the bar without saying hello to anyone.</p><p>Jack took one look at her and said, \u201cWhoa, boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeer,\u201d she said.</p><p>He served her up and said, \u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. Can\u2019t.\u201d She took a drink of the icy brew. \u201cBusiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be sticky business. You\u2019re pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy howdy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t ask me about it, because I\u2019m bound by confidentiality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be a doozie,\u201d he said.</p><p>Yeah, a doozie, she thought.</p><p>Jack slid an envelope across the bar to her. She looked at the return address\u2014it was from the clinic in Eureka he had visited. \u201cMaybe this will brighten your mood a little. I\u2019m clear.\u201d</p><p>She smiled a small smile. \u201cThat\u2019s good, Jack,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought it would come out like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to look?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cI trust you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and put a light kiss on her brow. \u201cThanks, that\u2019s nice,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead and sulk in your beer. Let me know if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>She began to calm down with her beer. It was probably a half hour later that Doc Mullins came into the bar and sat on the stool beside her. She glared at him, then focused again on her glass.</p><p>Doc raised a finger to Jack and he set up a whiskey. Then wisely, left the two of them alone.</p><p>Doc had a sip, then another, then said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. I can\u2019t leave you out of the loop like that if you\u2019re going to help take care of the town.\u201d</p><p>She turned and looked at him, one eyebrow lifted. \u201cDid you just apologize to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite, I didn\u2019t. But in this one instance, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m just used to acting on my own, is all. Meant no disrespect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to do anything at all. This is on me. If there\u2019s any malpractice involved, I don\u2019t want it on you. You were always prepared to do the right thing. I wanted to do the right thing, too\u2014but I had a different right thing in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she should be examined. I can do it or we can make her an appointment with John Stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call John,\u201d Doc said, taking another sip of his whiskey. \u201cI want you away from this for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this time, you\u2019ll actually make the call?\u201d</p><p>He turned and regarded her, glare for glare. \u201cI\u2019ll call him.\u201d</p><p>Mel just concentrated on her beer, which had gone warm and dull.</p><p>\u201cYou do a good job, missy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m getting too old for some things, especially the babies.\u201d He looked down at his hands, some fingers bent, knuckles swollen. \u201cI can still get things done, but these old hands aren\u2019t good on the women. Better you take care of women\u2019s health.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>She turned toward him. \u201cFirst a partial apology. Then a partial compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d he said without looking at her. \u201cI think you\u2019re needed here.\u201d</p> <p>She let out her breath slowly. She knew how hard that was for him. She took another deep breath and put her arm around his shoulders. She leaned her head against him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go soft on me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance,\u201d he returned.</p><p>Jack had no idea what had passed between Mel and Doc, but she said they were going back to the clinic and would have a bite to eat together there. He assumed they had issues to work out. Then she promised to come back to the bar before going home. He served quite a few people at six. By seven the crowd was thinning and there were only a few people there when the door opened. Charmaine. She\u2019d never come to Virgin River before; he\u2019d let her know that he wanted to keep those two parts of his life separate. She wasn\u2019t wearing waitress clothes tonight, so her intention was pretty obvious. She wore a nice pair of creased slacks, a crisp white blouse with the collar folded on the outside of a dark blue blazer. Her hair was down and full, makeup thick but perfect, heels. It pleased him to be reminded that she was a handsome woman, especially so when she didn\u2019t wear those tight clothes that drew attention to her large breasts. She looked classy. Mature.</p><p>She sat up at the bar and smiled at him. \u201cI thought I\u2019d drop by and see how you\u2019ve been,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cGood, Char. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a drink?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Yes. How about a Johnny Walker, ice. Make it a good Johnny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d He set her up with a black label\u2014he didn\u2019t have any blue. Too pricey for his usual crowd. In fact, he didn\u2019t move much of the black label. \u201cSo, what brings you to my neighborhood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to check in. See if things are the same with you.\u201d</p> <p>He looked down for a second, disappointed. He had hoped not to have to do this again, and certainly not here. This was no place to discuss their relationship, such as it had been. He looked back into her eyes and simply nodded.</p><p>\u201cNo change, then?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, hoping he could leave it at that.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, taking a sip of her drink. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. I was hoping that maybe we could...Never mind. I can tell by the look on your face\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChar, please. This isn\u2019t the right time or place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it easy, Jack, I\u2019m not going to push. Can\u2019t blame a girl for checking it out. After all, what we had was pretty special. To me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was special to me, too. I\u2019m sorry, but I had to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u2014you still insist there\u2019s no one else?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t at the time. I didn\u2019t lie to you. I\u2019ve never lied to you. But now\u2014\u201d</p><p>Just as he said that, the door swung open and Mel came in. Her expression earlier had been angry, but now it was subdued. Tired. And she did something she had never previously done. Rather than jumping up on a stool and asking for a beer, she came around the bar. To Charmaine he said, \u201cExcuse me just one second.\u201d He met Mel at the end of the bar.</p><p>Mel immediately put her arms around his waist and hugged him, laying her head on his chest. His arms went around her, as well, returning the gesture, painfully aware that Charmaine was burning a hole in his back with her eyes.</p><p>\u201cToday was trying,\u201d Mel said softly. \u201cDoc and I had a come-to-Jesus meeting about how we\u2019re going to work together, if we\u2019re going to work together. It was harder than I thought. Emotionally draining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Might I have one of those nifty little Crowns? I\u2019ve eaten and I promise to only have one, with ice, and you\u2019re welcome to take me home tonight. If you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? I\u2019m scared to death to let you go home alone. Who knows what you\u2019ll do, who you\u2019ll take a ride with.\u201d He put a small kiss on her brow and turned her around so she could go to the front of the bar. He didn\u2019t make eye contact with Charmaine, but rather fixed the drink and put it before Mel. By now she was on a stool at the very end of the bar. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to give me a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she said. \u201cTake your time. I just want to unwind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnwind away.\u201d He went back to Char.</p><p>The expression in Charmaine\u2019s eyes was one of hurt, but at least there was clarity. \u201cI think I understand,\u201d she said, taking another sip of her drink. He reached for her hand and held it. \u201cCharmaine, I wasn\u2019t lying. Doesn\u2019t really matter now, I guess, but I\u2019d like it if you believed I was telling the truth. There wasn\u2019t anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you wanted there to be.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, helplessly. He glanced at Mel. She was watching them. Her expression was perplexed and unhappy.</p><p>\u201cWell. Now I understand,\u201d Charmaine said, pulling her hand away from his. \u201cI\u2019m going to take off. Leave you to your business.\u201d</p><p>She plunked down a twenty-dollar bill, insulting a former lover who would buy her a drink. She whirled off the bar stool and headed for the door. Jack grabbed that twenty and went down to the end of the bar. \u201cMel, I\u2019ll be right back. Stay put.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake all the time you need,\u201d she said, but she didn\u2019t say it happily. Just the same he followed Charmaine outside. He called to her and she stopped once she got to her car. He caught up with her and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry it worked out like this. I wish you\u2019d just called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do.\u201d She had moist eyes, as though any minute there might be tears. \u201cI see now,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you do. This is...It\u2019s very recent,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut she was on your mind?\u201d</p><p>He took a breath. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love her,\u201d she said.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cOh, yeah. Big time.\u201d</p><p>She laughed hollowly. \u201cWell, who\u2019d guess. Mr. No-Attachments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to mislead you, Char. That\u2019s why I broke it off, because I knew if Mel gave me half a chance, I\u2019d find myself with two women, and I wouldn\u2019t do that to either one of you. I\u2019d never deliberately...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, take it easy, bub. She\u2019s young, she\u2019s pretty\u2014and you\u2019re a goner. Now I know. I just wanted to be sure.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her hands, pressing that twenty into one. \u201cYou can\u2019t believe I\u2019d let you buy a drink in my bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld lovers drink on the house?\u201d she asked sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cGood friends drink on the house.\u201d He leaned toward her and kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I hurt you. I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cI never saw it coming.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI understand, Jack. I miss you, is all. I hope it all works out for you, but if it doesn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cChar, if this doesn\u2019t work, I won\u2019t be worth a damn.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cOkay, then. I\u2019ll take off. Good luck, Jack.\u201d She got in her car, backed out and drove away. He watched until she was gone, then went back inside. He stood behind the bar, facing Mel. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn old friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClear River?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just checking up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanting another run at you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI made it clear...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you make clear? Huh, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m off the market. I tried to do that kindly.\u201d</p><p>Her expression softened somewhat. She smiled a little and put the palm of her hand against his cheek. \u201cWell, I guess I can\u2019t bitch about that. Your kindness is one of your best features. But tell me something, cowboy. Is she going to keep showing up here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I don\u2019t like competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any, Melinda. There never was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere better not be. Turns out I\u2019m a very selfish woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI broke it off with her before I even held your hand.\u201d</p><p>She lifted an amused eyebrow. \u201cThat was optimistic of you. You could have ended up with no one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA chance I was willing to take. The other way\u2014I didn\u2019t want to take that kind of chance. It could have seriously messed up what I wanted. And I wanted you.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cYou\u2019re being a pretty good sport about this,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cHey. I know why she was here. I wouldn\u2019t give you up at the point of a gun. Wanna take me home? Spend the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI always want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet permission from your bald guy then. I want you to prove yourself to me tonight. Again.\u201d Then she grinned.</p><p>July came in sunny and warm with a bit of occasional rain. Jack was sitting out on the porch when Rick showed up for work. He came in earlier in the day during summer when there was no school\u2014sometime between breakfast and lunch. It was the peculiar look on his face that caused Jack to say, \u201cHold up, pardner. How you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, Jack,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPull up a chair. I haven\u2019t wanted to ask, but it\u2019s been on my mind. You and Liz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Ricky said, leaning against the porch rail rather than sitting. \u201cMust show all over me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s showing. Everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d He took a breath. \u201cI kept after her to let me know if we were all clear, you know? And when she finally said it was okay, she wasn\u2019t pregnant or anything, I told her that I thought maybe we should cool it. It killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhooo,\u201d Jack said. \u201cRough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like the biggest dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess you had your reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to explain\u2014it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like her. A lot. I really like her a lot. I\u2019m not just saying that. And it\u2019s not just because of what we did. You know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that, yeah,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all up to you, bud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really like the girl a lot. I maybe even love her, if that doesn\u2019t sound too stupid. But it turns out it\u2019s a little too hot for me to handle, and I don\u2019t want to screw up my life and her life because of that. That one time\u2014Jack, I did not see that coming. I think it\u2019s best for her and me to put some miles between us. Does that make me a wimp?\u201d</p><p>Jack felt a slow smile spread across his lips. \u201cNah. That makes you a person with a brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like a damn dog. But Jack, that girl\u2014she just does it to me. Holy God. I get close to that girl and I have no brain at all.\u201d</p><p>Jack sat forward in his chair, leaning toward Rick. \u201cThere will be times when too hot to handle will work right into your plans, Rick. But you won\u2019t be sixteen anymore. You need to be smart. Sounds like you\u2019re being smart. I\u2019m sorry you and the girl are having a hard time with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right about this. Because I feel like shit. Plus, I miss her like mad. And not just that...I miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRicky, buddy, you are too young to be a daddy. I\u2019m sorry this hurts, but sometimes you have to do the difficult thing. And she\u2019s just too frickin\u2019 young to be put in that position. Someone has to be a grown-up. You\u2019re doing the right thing. If she\u2019s the right girl, it\u2019ll keep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, shaking his head sadly.</p><p>\u201cLet the girl get a little older, pal. Maybe you can check back with her later.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cOr maybe not, Jack. I think I hurt her real bad. I might not get another shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo yourself a favor. Don\u2019t keep going back to the scene of the crime. It\u2019ll just buy you trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Mel began to glow in the brightness of summer. She had a patient in her last trimester with a first baby and first babies were so much fun. This couple, unlike Polly and Darryl, unlike the sad and anonymous couple in the woods, had been trying for a baby for quite a while, so they were filled with anxiety and excitement. Anne and Jeremy Givens were in their late twenties and had been married eight years. Jeremy\u2019s dad owned a large orchard, and Jeremy and Anne lived on the land with the extended family. The baby would come before the apple crop.</p><p>Jack and Mel had solidified a couples\u2019 friendship with June and Jim, and John and Susan. They spent more time in Grace Valley and the other couples came to Virgin River twice\u2014once to Mel\u2019s little cabin for dinner, once to Jack\u2019s bar. On the last visit Susan announced that she wouldn\u2019t be leaving town again, unless she could use the twisting, bumpy, thirty-minute drive to start labor. She was about to pop. Jack invited Jim, Elmer Hudson and a friend of Elmer\u2019s, Judge Forrest, to fish with him and Preacher in the Virgin, and their catch was good. It made her almost as happy that the men were friends as it did that she had these women friends in her life. Given the time she was spending with her girlfriends, Mel had opened up a little, but just a little. She admitted she was in a relationship with Jack and that he was the best thing that had happened to her in Virgin River. \u201cIt looks like you were made for each other,\u201d Susan said. \u201cKind of like June and Jim\u2014barely acquainted and like old soul mates.\u201d</p><p>To Joey she reported, \u201cI never sleep by myself anymore. It feels more natural to have him near. And Joey\u2014it\u2019s so nice not to be alone anymore.\u201d She didn\u2019t dare tell her sister that after going out to a marijuana grow to deliver a baby, Jack would hardly let her out of his sight. She smiled secretly; there was always a bright spot to everything.</p><p>\u201cDo you get any sleep?\u201d Joey asked.</p><p>Mel laughed. \u201cI sleep very well, every night. But Joey,\u201d she said, shivering. \u201cI\u2019ve never known anything like this. Every time I look at him, I just want to get undressed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou deserve it, Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to do something that has me a little tense\u2014he\u2019s going to Sacramento for his youngest sister\u2019s birthday\u2014a gathering of the whole family. And he wants me to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would that make you tense? You sprung me on him and it went very well. He\u2019s crazy about me,\u201d she added with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried that they won\u2019t like me. I\u2019m worried they might make more of this than there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Joey said. \u201cHolding back a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on purpose,\u201d she answered. \u201cFor some reason I just can\u2019t stop feeling that I\u2019m married to someone else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Mel\u2014go! That other guy\u2014the one you still feel married to? He\u2019s not going to get in the way of this. In fact, if he\u2019s watching, he\u2019s probably glad you have someone special to warm up your nights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s watching,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m blushing.\u201d</p><p>Jack convinced her. All the way to Sacramento, she was nervous as a cat. \u201cI just don\u2019t want your family to think we\u2019re in a serious relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we?\u201d he asked her. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know there\u2019s no one else in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m completely monogamous. I just need time...You know...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cThis figures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll those years I made sure the woman I was seeing at the time knew I couldn\u2019t be tied down...There are women out there, Mel, who would think I\u2019m getting just what I deserve right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know what I mean. It\u2019s just my issues...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting out the issues. And I\u2019m serious about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very patient with me, Jack. And I appreciate it. I just don\u2019t want them to get the wrong idea. And we will sleep in separate bedrooms at your dad\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m over forty years old. I sleep with you every night. I told my dad that one bedroom would be just fine.\u201d</p><p>She sighed heavily. Nervously. \u201cOkay then. But we\u2019re not doing it at your dad\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>And he laughed at her.</p><p>It was so much hotter in Sacramento in July than in Virgin River. Hotter even than L.A. in July\u2014Sacramento was located on an inland valley and had no ocean breezes to cool the land.</p><p>Sam Sheridan still lived in the house where he\u2019d raised his five children\u2014a spacious ranch-style home in the suburbs with a lush yard, pool and a big kitchen. When Mel met him, she looked into the eyes of an older version of Jack\u2014a man of the same height and girth with thick, steel-gray hair, a big smile and a powerful handshake. Jack and Sam embraced like brothers, so happy to be together. The three of them had a nice evening with steak cooked on the backyard barbecue and red wine. The men insisted on cleaning up the dishes, so Mel took her glass of wine and wandered around the house a little bit. She found herself in what passed as Sam\u2019s study, or office or bragging room. There was a desk, a TV, computer, bookshelves and wall upon wall of pictures and awards. All his daughters in their wedding dresses, all his granddaughters, ranging in age from five to eighteen, but the thing she hadn\u2019t given any thought to at all were the pictures she would see of Jack. Pictures she had never seen around Jack\u2019s room\u2014a marine wearing rows of ribbons. Jack and his various squads and platoons, Jack and his parents, Jack and Generals. Jack and the guys who came to Virgin River for their Semper Fi reunions. And cases of medals. She didn\u2019t know much about military awards, but there was no mistaking three purple hearts and silver and bronze stars.</p><p>She reached out and gently ran her fingers over the glass case that held the medals. Sam came up behind her and put his hands on her shoulders. \u201cHe\u2019s a hero,\u201d he said softly. \u201cMany times over.\u201d</p><p>She looked over her shoulder at Sam. \u201cYou\u2019d never know that from talking to him,\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know.\u201d He laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s modest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Jack said, coming into the room, drying a wine glass with a dish towel. \u201cI told you to put all that shit away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah,\u201d Sam said, just ignoring his son, turning his back on him. \u201cThis one is from Desert Storm,\u201d he told Mel. \u201cAnd this\u2014Bosnia. There were downed fighter pilots\u2014</p><p>Jack and his unit went into a hot zone and pulled them out. He got shot in Afghanistan, but still managed to get his squad out of danger. And this one\u2014the latest Iraq conflict\u2014he saved six men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dishes done, son?\u201d he asked without turning around, dismissing Jack. Mel looked up at Sam. \u201cDo you think this bothers him? The memories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure some of them do. But it never bothered him enough to keep him from going back, time and again. They might\u2019ve sent him anyway, but every bit of training and fighting\u2014he volunteered. This boy has been awarded medals by many generals and one president. He was the marines\u2019 best\u2014and I\u2019m damn proud of him. He won\u2019t keep the medals with him. He\u2019d put \u2019em in storage or something. I have to keep them here to keep them safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not proud of this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Sam looked down at Mel. \u201cNot the medals so much as the men. He was committed to his men, not military awards. You didn\u2019t know this about my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew he was in the marines. I met some of his friends. These guys,\u201d she said, pointing at a picture.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a leader of men, Melinda,\u201d Sam said. He glanced over his shoulder and seeing that his son was gone, said, \u201cHe tends to act embarrassed that he was only a highschool graduate when his sisters\u2014and their husbands for that matter\u2014all hold college degrees, and even some postgraduate degrees among them. But I think the man has accomplished more, done more good and saved more lives, than many a man or woman with more education. And if you know him, you know he\u2019s very intelligent. If he\u2019d gone to college, he\u2019d have excelled there, as well, but this was his path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so gentle,\u201d she heard herself say.</p><p>\u201cHe is that. I\u2019ve seen him with each one of my granddaughters, handling them like they\u2019re nitro and might blow up if he makes a wrong move. But he is not gentle when he\u2019s in the fight. This man is not just a marine. He\u2019s a highly decorated hero. His sisters and I stand in awe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have been hard for you, when he was in combat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He looked at the pictures and medals with a wistful expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how much his mother and I missed him. Worried about him. But he did what he was driven to do. And he did it well.\u201d Sam smiled. \u201cWe\u2019d better get back to the kitchen. He gets surly when I brag.\u201d</p><p>When Mel got up the next morning, Jack was not beside her. She heard him talking with his dad in another room; she heard them laughing, so she showered and dressed before joining them. She found them in the dining room, paperwork spread out all over the table.</p><p>\u201cBoard meeting?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Sam said. \u201cSo, son, everything look okay to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. As usual.\u201d He stuck out his hand and shook his father\u2019s. \u201cThanks, Dad. Appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Sam gathered up the papers, clutched them in a stack atop an accordion file and left the room.</p><p>\u201cMy dad was an agent for a brokerage firm before he retired. While I was in the marines, I\u2019d send him money from time to time. He\u2019s been investing for me for twenty years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think a marine made a lot of money,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut if you\u2019re single and you keep re-upping and going to war, there are bonuses, incentives, combat pay, promotions. My buddies\u2014most of them\u2014had those benefits eaten up by housing, braces on kids\u2019 teeth, the usual. I always lived cheap and saved. My dad,\u201d he said, \u201che always made that such an issue while I was growing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart man,\u201d she said, and she wasn\u2019t speaking of Sam.</p><p>Jack grinned. \u201cYou thought I was making a killing on that little Virgin River bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured you didn\u2019t need to. With a military retirement and low cost of living...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. That aside, I\u2019m set,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the bar burns to the ground, all I have to do is support Preach for the rest of his life. And I\u2019d like to make sure Ricky gets an education. That\u2019s about it.\u201d He reached for her hand. \u201cOtherwise, I have everything I need.\u201d</p><p>That afternoon the rest of the family descended on the Sheridan home\u2014four sisters and their husbands, eight nieces. As they came, one family at a time, they flung themselves on Jack. His sisters ran to him, hugging and kissing him. His brothers-inlaw embraced him fondly. He picked up each one of his nieces and hugged them like they were his daughters, spun them around, laughed into their pretty faces. Mel wasn\u2019t sure what she had expected them to be like. Having seen the family picture in his room and those around the house, she knew they were a good looking family; good genes. His sisters were very different from each other, but each was svelte, lovely, smart. Donna, the oldest, was very tall, probably five-ten, with short, frosted hair, Jeannie was nearly as tall, quite thin and chic, Mary was next tallest at perhaps five-five, but so trim and fragile-looking it was hard to imagine her handling a big commercial jet. Donna and Jeannie each had three daughters, Mary had two. And then there was Brie, the baby, celebrating her thirtieth birthday. She was the only sister who did not yet have children. She was just about the same size as Mel with long light brown hair that fell down her back almost to her waist\u2014a little bitty thing who put away hardened criminals for a living. And their men, like Jack and Sam, were big guys, the nieces, each one beautiful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Jack\u2019s sisters brought some of Mel\u2019s closest friends with them\u2014Ralph Lauren, Lilly Pulitzer, Michael Kors and Coach. Each one of them had a strong sense of style, but what was more obvious than their collective taste in fashion was their warmth and humor. They all met Mel with delight, eschewing the offered handshake and immediately embracing her. It was a very physical, affectionate family. Every time Mel stole a look at Jack he had his arms around a sister or niece, frequently dropping kisses on their heads or cheeks. Just as frequently he would seek out Mel and put a possessive arm about her shoulders or waist. And to her surprise, so would Sam, as though they\u2019d been close for years.</p><p>All Brie had wanted for her birthday was to have the family together and her brother home. \u201cHe\u2019s not so very far away,\u201d Mel said. \u201cDon\u2019t you get to see him often?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot nearly often enough,\u201d Brie said. \u201cJack has been essentially gone for twenty-three years. Since he was seventeen.\u201d</p><p>It was a loud day, filled with laughter and good food. Sam took care of the meat while the sisters brought delicious side dishes. After dinner, the kids took off to watch DVDs on the big screen or jump in the backyard pool or play video games on grandpa\u2019s computer. It was just the adults sitting around the patio tables and they told stories about Jack that almost made him blush.</p><p>\u201cRemember, Dad, when you were giving away Jack\u2019s bed and were going to surprise him with a new bigger one because he\u2019d gotten so tall? So heavy?\u201d Immediate laughter from everyone\u2014Mel was the only one not intimate with this story. \u201cA friend of the family wanted the bed for one of his younger kids. He was a respected member of the PTA...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, you act like he was the frickin\u2019 preacher or something,\u201d Jack protested.</p><p>\u201cAnd when they pulled off the mattress, Jack\u2019s private library was exposed for all eyes to see,\u201d Donna said, and everyone howled.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d been raising girls,\u201d Sam said. \u201cI completely forgot what boys were doing when they were supposed to be doing homework.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least it was good, solid, decent girlie magazines and not pictures of women in bras from Sears catalog,\u201d Jack said in his defense. \u201cFine, upstanding, naked women!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, here,\u201d the brothers-in-law intoned.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Mel said, \u201cI\u2019ve noticed there\u2019s only one bathroom besides the master bath in this house...\u201d</p><p>Immediate noise erupted\u2014shouts, laughter, whistles, jeering. \u201cWe used to have the biggest fights over the bathroom,\u201d one of the women said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t in that,\u201d Jack insisted.</p> <p>\u201cYou were the worst!\u201d it was accused.</p><p>\u201cPlus, when he got the bathroom, he\u2019d stay in there for hours! He wouldn\u2019t give it up until all the hot water was gone!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom had to give him a timer for his shower\u2014so the rest of us could get clean, too. Of course, he just ignored it. And Mom would say, now, now, I know Jack\u2019s trying. Because Jack was her little precious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI started showering at night\u2014it was the only way,\u201d Donna said.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of nights\u2014do you know what he used to do to us at night? Mary and I had the same bedroom, and it was crammed to the ceiling with our stuff. Jack and one of his friends used to sneak in when we were asleep and tie strings to our fingers and toes and connect the strings to stuff around the room, so when we turned over in our sleep\u2014everything came crashing down around us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing,\u201d Jeannie said. \u201cI used to come home from school and find all my stuffed animals with nooses around their necks, hanging from my bed canopy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey act like they never did anything to me,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the time we were all in the family room, all five of us, and Mom came into the room with a bunch of condoms in her hand and said, \u2018Guess what I found floating in the washer? Jack, I imagine these must belong to you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Wild laughter erupted and Jack got all stirred up. \u201cYeah, but they weren\u2019t mine, were they? Because mine were right where I\u2019d left them! I suspect Donna!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a feminist,\u201d Donna declared.</p><p>\u201cMom would never have believed it\u2014Donna was her pride and joy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonna was screwing around!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take these stories,\u201d Sam said, standing up and going for a beer, making them all laugh.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Dad,\u201d Donna yelled. \u201cI don\u2019t need birth control anymore!\u201d</p><p>When it was time to clean up and the sun had set, the men went off somewhere and three of the sisters insisted that the birthday girl and the guest relax while they did the work. Mel was left with Brie. They sat at the patio table by candlelight.</p><p>\u201cMy brother has never brought a woman home before,\u201d Brie said.</p><p>\u201cAfter watching him with his family\u2014all these females\u2014it\u2019s so hard to imagine. He\u2019s completely comfortable with women. He should have been married years ago. He should have a big family of his own,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cIt just never happened,\u201d Brie put in. \u201cI blame it on the marines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I first met him, I asked him if he\u2019d ever been married and he said, \u2018I was married to the marines, and she was a real bitch.\u2019\u201d Brie laughed. \u201cHave you visited him in Virgin River?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cNot en masse,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve all gotten up there at one time or another. The guys like to fish with Jack and Preacher. Dad will go up there for as long as a couple of weeks at a time\u2014he loves that little bar of Jack\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack seems to have found his niche, his happy place,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI\u2019ve only been there a little over four months, and my adjustment hasn\u2019t been that easy. I\u2019m used to bigcity medicine where you can get anything you want, and fast. This is a whole new game. And I had to drive for two hours to get a decent haircut and frost job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you choose Virgin River?\u201d Brie asked her.</p><p>\u201cHmm. The flip side of big-city medicine\u2014I\u2019d had it with the chaos and crime. As I told Jack, I left the E.R. not just because I felt drawn to midwifery, but I thought I could get away from having half my patients brought in by the police. And guess what? The first woman I ever delivered had multiple felony warrants and was being arrested when she went into labor. She was handcuffed to the bed when I examined her prior to delivery.\u201d She chuckled. \u201cI was looking for something smaller and simpler.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI got smaller, but simpler? Little towns like Virgin River have their own challenges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike how about loading a critical patient in the back of a pickup truck and speeding down the mountain, hanging on for dear life, trying to get her to the hospital before she goes into cardiac arrest. Man, did I ever lust after that big, chaotic emergency room that day. And there\u2019s always the adventure of having your services requested by a big, gun-toting drug farmer in the middle of the night...Um, if you tell Jack that version of the story, there\u2019s going to be a scene.\u201d</p><p>Brie laughed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot some of the details. He was very pissed that I went alone to an unknown location with a man who was basically a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s a good thing I did. There were complications with the delivery. But I don\u2019t think that will cheer up Jack too much.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cJack\u2019s protective. Of everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you found your niche?\u201d Brie asked.</p><p>\u201cI kind of crave a trip to Nordstrom\u2019s,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind a facial and leg wax, either. On the other hand, I didn\u2019t realize I could get by on so little. So simply. There\u2019s something about that...It\u2019s freeing, in a way. And there\u2019s no question, it\u2019s beautiful. Sometimes it\u2019s so quiet, your ears ring. But when I first got there, I thought I\u2019d really screwed up big\u2014it was so much more rugged and isolated than I expected. The mountain roads terrified me, and Doc and I manage in that clinic with the most rudimentary equipment. The cabin I was promised, rent free for a year, was horrible. In fact, my first morning there the porch collapsed and dumped me into a deep, freezing mud puddle. The cabin was so filthy, I was on my way out of town\u2014running for my life\u2014when a medical emergency stopped me and I reluctantly stayed a few days that turned into a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat turned into a few months...\u201d Brie observed.</p><p>\u201cJack renovated the cabin without being asked, while I stayed at Doc\u2019s house,\u201d Mel said. \u201cAbout the time I was going to make a break for it, he showed it to me. I said I\u2019d give it a few more days. Then my first delivery occurred and I realized I should give the place a chance. There\u2019s something about a successful delivery in a place like Virgin River where there\u2019s no backup, no anesthesia...Just me and Mom...It\u2019s indescribable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there\u2019s Jack,\u201d Brie said.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d Mel repeated. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I\u2019ve met a kinder, stronger, more generous man. Your brother is wonderful, Brie. He\u2019s amazing. Everyone in Virgin River loves him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother is in love with you,\u201d Brie said.</p><p>Mel shouldn\u2019t have been shocked. Although he hadn\u2019t said the words, she already knew it. Felt it. At first she thought he was just a remarkable lover, but soon she realized that he couldn\u2019t touch her that way without an emotional investment, as well as a physical one. He gave her everything he had\u2014and not just in the bedroom. It was in her mind to tell Brie\u2014I\u2019m a recent widow! I need time to digest this! I don\u2019t feel free yet\u2014free to accept another man\u2019s love! Her cheeks grew warm and she said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI realize I\u2019m biased, but when a man like Jack loves a woman, it\u2019s a great honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Mel said quietly.</p><p>Late, in the dark of night, as he held her in his arms in the bed in his father\u2019s house, she said, \u201cYou have the most wonderful family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was such fun watching you all together. They\u2019re ruthless\u2014you don\u2019t have a secret left!\u201d And she laughed.</p><p>\u201cI told you. No slack here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what fun, to have all that history, all those hysterical stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014I listened to you and Joey for a few days. You didn\u2019t grow up deprived.\u201d He kissed her neck. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you had fun. I knew you would.\u201d He kissed her neck again, nuzzling closer.</p><p>\u201cYour sisters are all so put together,\u201d she said. \u201cVery classy, very sharp. I used to dress like that, before I moved to a place where you\u2019re overdressed in good jeans. You should have seen my closet in L.A.\u2014it was huge, and bulging.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the T-shirt she wore up and over her head. \u201cI like what you\u2019re wearing right now. In fact, I find you overdressed in this thong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, I thought we decided, we\u2019re not going to do it in your father\u2019s house...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you said you weren\u2019t going to.\u201d He slipped the thong down. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of going after that G-spot again...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she said, weakening. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t. You know how we get...\u201d</p><p>He rose above her and grinned into her eyes. \u201cWant me to get a sock for your mouth?\u201d</p><p>Susan Stone delivered her son in August\u2014a robust eight-pounder. She went to Valley Hospital, had a stunning delivery and was home in Grace Valley in forty-eight hours. It was in Mel\u2019s mind to give her some time alone with her baby, but both John and June called and urged her to come the next Sunday afternoon, the baby not yet a week old. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Jack would not be left behind. He brought the beer and cigars. Susan was very fit for a woman who had just delivered, but still she stayed on the couch, bassinet nearby, and let her friends fuss over her. In typical country fashion, women brought food so that the new parents wouldn\u2019t have to be bothered with cooking. Mel was surprised to see such an air of celebration and atmosphere of an open house so soon after bringing a baby home.</p><p>There was another couple present, a very pregnant Julianna Dickson and her husband Mike. John dropped an arm around Julianna\u2019s shoulders and said to Mel, \u201cThis one is legendary\u2014she could never seem to wait for the doctor. June and I finally got to attend one of her births\u2014it was the last baby, and it was sheer luck. She delivers with about fifteen minutes notice. This is number six. We\u2019re going to admit her tomorrow and induce.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t let the baby hear you say that,\u201d Julianna said. \u201cYou know what always happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should go over there right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should strap yourself to me and keep one hand on my stomach.\u201d</p><p>The women gathered in the living room around Susan with cups of coffee and cake. John plucked the baby out of his bassinet to show him off. As Jim already had baby Jamie in his arms, John offered the baby to Jack. And he willingly, happily took him into his arms. He cooed at the little bundle.</p><p>Mel\u2019s eyes warmed as she watched him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty good at that for a bachelor,\u201d John said appreciatively.</p><p>\u201cNieces,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cEight of them,\u201d Mel added.</p><p>Jack jiggled and the baby sent up a loud wail. \u201cI guess you\u2019re not that good,\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cJack did fine. He\u2019s hungry,\u201d Susan said, reaching for the baby.</p><p>\u201cOkay\u2014there\u2019s going to be breast-feeding,\u201d John said. \u201cWe should find something to do.\u201d</p> <p>Jack pulled cigars out of his breast pocket and immediately a very grateful hum of approval sounded. Jim handed Jamie off to June and left the women and babies in the house to go outside and indulge.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to stink,\u201d Julianna said.</p><p>\u201cTo high heaven,\u201d June agreed.</p><p>\u201cAt least they\u2019re out of our hair.\u201d Susan settled the newborn onto her breast and Mel watched with longing. \u201cMel,\u201d she said. \u201cHow\u2019d it go in Sacramento? With Jack\u2019s family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they\u2019re fantastic,\u201d she said, coming back to herself again. \u201cFour sisters who tell every secret he\u2019d ever dream of keeping, and eight nieces, all beautiful, all in love with their uncle Jack. It was delightful. So, Susan\u2014how was your labor? Back labor, like you predicted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEpidural,\u201d she said with a grin. \u201cPiece of cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had time for one of those,\u201d Julianna said somewhat wistfully, smoothing a hand over her round tummy.</p><p>\u201cYou and Julianna are awful close to the same due date,\u201d Mel observed. They all laughed. \u201cI might\u2019ve neglected to mention\u2014the big fight John and I had before this little conception? It happened at a night of cards with Julianna and Mike.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were both so furious with our husbands\u2014they had both been banished. Apparently we let them both into bed at about the same time.\u201d More laughter. Julianna rubbed her swollen tummy. \u201cI meant to stop doing this...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat in the world happened?\u201d Mel wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cLong story short\u2014they had a couple of beers and started in on working women. I wanted to work alongside John and June in the clinic, but John wanted me to stay home, mind my own business and clean house. And make sure he had one of those solid country meals in front of him when he got home. Now, I come from the part of the world where a salad with some chicken strips is a dining delight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, on the other hand, thought it was wonderful that I didn\u2019t work. With five kids and a farmhouse to run,\u201d Julianna said.</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cThey were made to suffer very appropriately,\u201d June put in. \u201cNo conversation, no sex. Perfect discipline for idiots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it turn out?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cWell, when I\u2019m not nine months pregnant or post partum and nursing, I run the clinic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd very well, at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut a side effect was...Well, as you can plainly see\u2014we had been knocked up. You might not want to drink the water around here,\u201d Susan advised.</p><p>\u201cNo kidding,\u201d said June, propping Jamie on her shoulder.</p><p>I drank the water, Mel almost said.</p><p>Nursing done, Susan passed the baby to Mel. She smiled gratefully and took the little guy. His rosy round face was contented in sleep; little baby noises escaped him. The women talked about their labors, about their men, and they brought Mel into the conversation very well with questions about her midwifery experiences. June went to the kitchen for the coffeepot and refilled them all while Mel happily cuddled with the newborn. Her breasts actually ached as she held him. Hormones are amazing, she found herself thinking.</p><p>On the way back to Virgin River, Jack said, \u201cYour friends throw a nice little party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they?\u201d she replied, reaching across the truck\u2019s front seat to hold his hand.</p><p>\u201cAll these babies,\u201d Jack said. \u201cEverywhere you look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverywhere.\u201d</p><p>He pulled up in front of her cabin. \u201cI\u2019ll shower off the cigars,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she answered. \u201cIt actually makes me a little nauseous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey. I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo big deal. But I\u2019ll be glad to loan you the shower. And meet you in the bed. I\u2019m suddenly exhausted.\u201d</p><p>Mel was just pulling up to the clinic in the morning when beside her an old pickup was pulling into the next parking spot. She recognized the man at once\u2014Calvin. She hadn\u2019t seen him since that first time, when she treated his facial wounds. He jumped out of the truck as she got out of the Hummer. His hands were plunged into his pockets and he seemed to nearly vibrate with the jitters. She suddenly realized something\u2014the man who took her to deliver his baby in the backwoods, also a grower, didn\u2019t seem to be on anything. This guy was wired. High. She\u2019d never have gotten in a truck, in the middle of the night, with Calvin\u2014baby or no baby. She further realized that without a plan of any kind, she could get hurt if she refused such a request from Calvin. He was pretty scary, and clearly unstable. Before she could even address him, he said, \u201cI need something. Back pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d she asked calmly, very practiced in handling his type back in the city.</p><p>\u201cPain medicine. I need something for pain. Fentanyl, maybe. OxyContin. Morphine. Something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hurt your back?\u201d she asked, trying to avoid his eyes as she proceeded to Doc\u2019s front porch. He was jerking and tweaking, and upright rather than sitting on a low stool, she became aware of his size. He was almost six feet and broad-shouldered. It was clear he\u2019d gotten his hands on something not depressive. Maybe methamphetamine, as Doc had earlier suspected. He wanted a narcotic to bring him down. The pot from his garden must not be doing it for him.</p><p>\u201cFell off a ledge out there. Might\u2019ve broke it. It\u2019ll be okay, but I need a little medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019ll have to see Doc,\u201d she said.</p><p>His feet moved nervously. He pulled a hand out of his pocket and grabbed at her sleeve and she jerked out of his reach.</p><p>Jack, coming from her cabin arrived behind her and was just pulling into town as Calvin made that move and for a split second she almost felt sorry for him. Jack accelerated, screeched to a stop within inches of Doc\u2019s porch and was out of the truck in one second. \u201cGet away from her!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>The guy backed away, but just a little bit. He looked at Mel. \u201cI just need something for the pain in my back,\u201d he said.</p><p>Jack reached into his truck and had his hand on his rifle. The look in his eyes was frightening. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said to Jack. Then to the twitchy young man, \u201cI don\u2019t prescribe the kind of drugs you\u2019re looking for. We leave that to the doctor. And he\u2019ll want an X-ray, undoubtedly.\u201d</p><p>The guy stared at her, then grinned stupidly. \u201cYou ain\u2019t got no X-ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one at Valley Hospital,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jack pulled the rifle off the rack and held it at his side for a moment. Then he kicked the truck door closed and came up onto the porch to stand beside Mel. He put an arm around Mel and pulled her against him. \u201cWant to see the doctor?\u201d he asked Calvin, rifle in hand.</p><p>\u201cHey, man,\u201d he laughed nervously. \u201cWhat\u2019s your deal, man?\u201d He backed away with his hands up, palms facing Jack. \u201cTake it easy. I\u2019ll go to the valley,\u201d he said. He jumped off the porch, not bothering with the steps. Must be some back pain, she thought. He got in the old pickup, started it, put it in gear and drove away. But he didn\u2019t go toward the valley\u2014he went toward the woods.</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>\u201cHe was at that camp Doc and I went to a few months ago. When you watched the baby for us. You remember...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPaulis\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Did you have to do that?\u201d Mel asked. \u201cHe really hadn\u2019t done anything threatening.\u201d</p><p>Jack glared after the departing truck. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to. He\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s just wrong.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>E very August before school started, the Andersons played host to a huge late-summer picnic at their ranch. Everyone they knew in Virgin River and even some folks from surrounding towns showed up. Buck had a huge canvas tent he erected in the pasture outside the corral, barbecues were set up, people provided tables and chairs. The Bristols brought their miniature horses and set up pony rides. Jack always donated a couple of kegs while Preacher whipped up some of his best potato salad in a tub so big it looked as if it would feed a third-world nation. There were barrels of lemonade and iced tea, ice chests full of sodas and, in the afternoon, homemade ice-cream makers were brought out of trucks and SUVs, and the hand cranking began. The barn floor was swept clean and a small band was set up for country dancing. There were children everywhere, running from one end of the ranch to the other, from corral to hay loft.</p><p>Mel had looked forward to the picnic as a chance to hold Chloe for a while, and also to do something she hadn\u2019t done before\u2014meet the rest of the Anderson family. She had a passing acquaintance with two of the three sons who worked the ranch with Buck, and one of the daughters had come to Doc\u2019s for a prenatal exam, but otherwise, they were strangers to her.</p><p>But not strangers for very long. Each one of them, the sons, the daughters, their spouses and children, greeted her as the person who had given them Chloe. The baby was passed around from Anderson to Anderson, cuddled, swept up in the air, kissed, tickled. Even the little ones\u2014Lilly and Buck\u2019s seven grandchildren\u2014ran to Chloe to snuggle her as if she were their newest sweet puppy. Buck was pretty busy around the barn and barbecues, but from time to time he was near the picnic tables or food tables and she would catch a glimpse of him holding Chloe comfortably on his hip. The Andersons were wonderful, homespun, authentic people with nothing but tons of love in their hearts. Just like Lilly; sweet, nurturing and tender. The sun was beginning to lower in the late afternoon sky when Jack found Mel sitting on the porch swing with the baby, giving her a bottle. He sat beside her and played idly with Chloe\u2019s dark curls. \u201cShe seems to be doing well here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cShe should,\u201d Mel said. \u201cShe\u2019s home.\u201d And it gave her deep satisfaction to know that this was true in all ways.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to spin you around the barn a little bit,\u201d he said, leaning over the baby\u2019s head to give her a kiss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cAnother surprise. You dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that might be overly optimistic,\u201d he said. \u201cI do something. I\u2019ll try not to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>Lilly came out of the house, wiping her hands on her apron. \u201cHere, Mel, let me take her off your hands. I\u2019ll put her to bed.\u201d</p><p>Mel stood with the baby in her arms and walked into the house, Lilly right behind her. She turned and placed the baby in Lilly\u2019s arms. Then she leaned toward Lilly and gave her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cYou have a wonderful family,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find just the right time to tell them.\u201d</p><p>Mel made an appointment at the Grace Valley clinic. She was surprised to learn that both doctors were available, so she requested the OB. Prenatal consult, she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go ahead and put your patient with Dr. Stone,\u201d the receptionist said, and Mel did not correct her. After all, she\u2019d been there before with a couple of pregnant women for ultrasounds and they knew her as the midwife upriver. After seeing a few patients, Mel headed for Grace Valley in the afternoon.</p><p>It had only been a short time since the gathering at the Stones\u2019 house and she could no longer deny the truth. She was pregnant. She already knew it. They had plenty of pregnancy tests on hand at Doc\u2019s and she\u2019d used one. Then another one. And another. Half of her hoped it was wrong, the other half was afraid it was. When she got to the clinic, June was hanging around the reception desk. \u201cHey, there.\u201d</p> <p>She leaned as if looking around Mel. \u201cI thought you were bringing in a prenatal consult?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mel said. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>June\u2019s eyes grew momentarily round, surprised.</p><p>\u201cIt must be the water,\u201d Mel said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cCome on back. You\u2019re with John, and as you know, our nurse is on maternity leave. Want me to stand in or keep out of your business?\u201d</p><p>Mel felt a shudder of nervous emotion. \u201cPlease, come with me. I think I need to explain a few things,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, boy,\u201d June said, draping an arm around her shoulders. \u201cSounds like it might be a little complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a little,\u201d Mel answered.</p><p>John came out of the back and said, \u201cHey, Melinda. You bring me a prenatal consult?\u201d Before she could answer, June inclined her head toward Mel. \u201cOh,\u201d John said. \u201cWell, first things first\u2014June, set her up in there. Let\u2019s get the facts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mel said, suddenly meek and nervous. \u201cBut I already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try and make my job so easy,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cThere\u2019s no challenge in that.\u201d</p><p>Mel went into the exam room where she found a gown and sheet. She undressed and sat up on the table, waiting. How was she supposed to feel about this? She\u2019d been desperate for a baby, and now she was having one. Why did it feel so damn confusing? As though something had gone wrong, when in reality it had finally gone right.</p><p>But this wasn\u2019t what she had planned. And she knew it wasn\u2019t what Jack had planned\u2014he\u2019d offered to take care of their birth control needs. Oh, brother, was he going to be surprised.</p><p>John came in, June on his heels. \u201cHow are you feeling, Mel?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBesides terribly confused? A little nauseous in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamnest thing, isn\u2019t it? But you\u2019re keeping food down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>June set up the instruments and pap slide while John got her blood pressure. \u201cWant to talk first or second?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cSecond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. June\u2014can you fire up the ultrasound? Thanks. Mel, lie back and slide down for me, okay?\u201d He guided her feet into the stirrups and kept hands on her legs in case she slid too far and accidentally fell. When her position was solid, he took his place on his stool and snapped on the rubber gloves. He inserted the speculum. \u201cYou know how far along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months,\u201d she said, her voice quieter than usual. \u201cApproximately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said. Beside her the ultrasound bleeped as it warmed up. He pulled out the speculum after the pap slide was complete and gently palpated the uterus, measuring for size. \u201cYou\u2019re almost as good at this as I am, Mel,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou have reached the right approximate diagnosis. Good. Everything\u2019s good.\u201d He pulled the wand from the ultrasound; because this was an early pregnancy he would do an internal probe for a better reading as opposed to running the probe over her still flat belly. \u201cTurn your head, Mel,\u201d he said. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d he added. She looked at the monitor. Tears slid out of her eyes and into the hair at her temples. There it was, a small mass, limbs just visible to the practiced eye, moving around inside of her. They watched the new life for a little while and she gave a hiccup of emotion, moving a trembling hand to cover her mouth.</p><p>\u201cJust about twelve weeks,\u201d John said. \u201cOut of the miscarriage woods. We\u2019ll print you out a picture, though the view is going to be lots better in another few weeks.\u201d</p><p>He removed the probe and helped her to sit up. June leaned a hip on the counter and John returned to his stool.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in perfect health,\u201d her doctor said.</p><p>June handed Mel a tissue. \u201cI\u2019ve been there, Mel,\u201d June said. \u201cBelieve me.\u201d</p><p>Finally John said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Mel? How can we help?\u201d</p><p>She blotted her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to do this to you, but it\u2019s just so complicated.\u201d</p><p>John reached out to her and gave her knee a squeeze. \u201cIt probably isn\u2019t as complicated as you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wait,\u201d she said with a weak, embarrassed laugh. \u201cHow about I start by telling you I\u2019m hopelessly infertile.\u201d</p><p>He gave a little laugh. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2014you have a uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes...And I\u2019ve heard this business of not being able to get pregnant from pregnant women before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I went through three years of infertility treatment, including surgery, without success. We even had one very expensive, very failed attempt at in vitro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that puts an interesting spin on things. Maybe you should back up a little. You don\u2019t have to talk to us, Mel. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to. I need advice. I\u2019m a mess. See\u2014before moving up here from L.A., I was married. My husband was a doctor\u2014we often worked together. We tried desperately to have a baby. He was killed when he happened into a robbery in progress. That was a year and three months ago. Almost exactly. I came up here looking for a simpler life, a safer life. I just wanted to start over.\u201d</p><p>John shrugged. \u201cKind of looks like you found what you were looking for.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cVirgin River isn\u2019t all that simple. But yes, in some important ways, I found what I was looking for,\u201d she agreed. \u201cOf course, this wasn\u2019t planned. I didn\u2019t think it was possible for me to get pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the problem Jack?\u201d June asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but he doesn\u2019t know it. He\u2019s so wonderful, but he knew from the beginning that I wasn\u2019t quite over my husband. I adore Jack\u2014you can\u2019t imagine\u2014but I still haven\u2019t gotten to that point where I feel free to move on to\u2014\u201d She took a breath. \u201cTo another man.\u201d They gave her a moment and another tissue. \u201cThis is supposed to be my baby with my husband. The one we tried so hard to have.\u201d She blew her nose. June stepped forward and took her hand. \u201cIt seems apparent that Jack loves you. And that he\u2019s a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood with children,\u201d John put in.</p><p>\u201cWhether you planned to or not,\u201d June said with a shrug, \u201cit appears you have moved on. At least in some ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last time I gave my heart and soul to a man, he died,\u201d she said with a sniffle. Then she lowered her head and a couple of tears fell on the hands folded in her lap. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could survive something like that again.\u201d</p><p>June stepped forward and took her into her arms and John was quick to join her. They comforted her for a minute. Then John gave her shoulders a squeeze and said, \u201cMel, I like Jack\u2019s chances. Five wars couldn\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive wars?\u201d June asked.</p><p>John shrugged. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew he was in the marines!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen actually do talk,\u201d John said.</p><p>\u201cThat husband of mine,\u201d she groused. \u201cHe\u2019s so badly trained!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so confused,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what to do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, that\u2019s not true. It\u2019s a done deal, Mel,\u201d John said. \u201cNow you just have to be a little kind to yourself and work through it. You wanted a baby real bad, and you\u2019re having one. Jack\u2014he doesn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He knows I\u2019m widowed\u2014he\u2019s the only one who knows in Virgin River. But he doesn\u2019t know how hard I tried for a baby. He\u2019s been so supportive of me in my grieving moments\u2014he hasn\u2019t said a word to anyone, because I asked him not to. It\u2019s easier, you know\u2014when people don\u2019t look at you that way. Like you might be in constant pain. But,\u201d she said, \u201che also offered to take care of our birth control concerns, and of course I told him I had it covered. I was absolutely sure I couldn\u2019t get pregnant. God, I\u2019d never do this to a man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man, Jack. He\u2019s going to understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to think I tricked him, isn\u2019t he? I mean, he\u2019s forty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, lot of that going around, too,\u201d June said. \u201cI remember dealing with some of these same issues when I found out I was pregnant. Jim was over forty when I broke it to him that he was going to be a father. I was afraid he\u2019d bolt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had surgery to remove endometriosis, had my tubes blown out, took hormones, took my temperature every day for two years...\u201d She hiccupped. \u201cWe tried everything. Mark wanted a baby as badly as I did. I\u2019m telling you\u2014I\u2019m completely sterile!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelll....\u201d they both said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the funniest thing,\u201d John said. \u201cNature suffers to fill a void. I can\u2019t believe how many miraculous pregnancies I\u2019ve seen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if Jack is furious? Who would blame him? I mean, he hasn\u2019t even been in a serious relationship, and here I come. Bouncing into town, telling him I have the birth control issue covered. What if he just says, no, thank you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething tells me he\u2019s not going to say that,\u201d John said. \u201cBut, there\u2019s only one way to find out. And\u2014at three months\u2014I\u2019d recommend you not wait much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cOf Jack?\u201d June asked, shocked.</p><p>\u201cJesus, of everything! I\u2019m not even sure I should be here! From the beginning, I thought it was a mistake, making such a big change. I\u2019m a city girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d never know it,\u201d June said. \u201cYou seem to fit in just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome days I think this place was just what I needed. Other days I ask myself what I\u2019m doing here. Not only that, do you know how scary it is to think of being committed again and opening myself up to the pain that follows when something goes terribly, terribly wrong? I\u2019m afraid to move on\u2014even though you\u2019re right\u2014I already have. I still cry sometimes\u2014over my dead husband. How can I ask another man to put up with that?\u201d She drew in a jagged breath. \u201cAt the very least, we should have been able to plan for a possible baby before...\u201d</p><p>June held her hand. \u201cHardly any of us manages to work things out that neatly,\u201d she said. June lifted Mel\u2019s chin with a finger and looked into her eyes. \u201cI think you should try to remember two things\u2014you have a baby inside you now, a baby you longed for. And a good man back in Virgin River. Go with it, Mel. You\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Mel knew John and June were right. It was important to face this head-on and tell Jack as soon as possible. Let him have time to react. Respond. When she got back to Virgin River, she intended to go straight to the bar. But there, in front of Doc\u2019s, was a car she recognized. Anne and Jeremy Givens. It was her time. When she got inside she found the Givenses with Doc, waiting in the kitchen with a cup of tea. \u201cSo this is it?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cI think so,\u201d Anne said. \u201cI\u2019ve been in labor all day, and now I\u2019m having contractions less than five minutes apart and some spotting. That\u2019s when you said to call, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we decided. Would you like to come upstairs, settle in and let me check you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d Anne said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, there is nothing in the world to be afraid of. You\u2019re going to sail through this. Jeremy, why don\u2019t you let me get Anne comfortable and then you can come upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I want to be there for everything!\u201d he said.</p><p>Mel laughed in amusement. \u201cShe\u2019s just going to get undressed, Jeremy. I bet you\u2019ve been there for that about a million times.\u201d She took Anne\u2019s suitcase and her arm.</p> <p>\u201cCome on, sweetheart. Let\u2019s go have a baby.\u201d</p><p>Once settled in, Anne proved to be only four centimeters dilated. Back at the hospital in L.A. they would call that the price of admission\u2014anything less than four centimeters and you were sent home to labor a little longer. Mel observed a couple of contractions and they were coming strong and long. That business about sailing through was perhaps overly optimistic.</p><p>Jeremy was at his wife\u2019s side as soon as he was invited and, unlike Darryl, he was completely prepared for the rigors of labor. This couple actually had had some birthing training. Mel told Jeremy to walk his wife up and down the upstairs hallway and left Anne in his able hands to go downstairs to use the phone to call Jack.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a delivery, so I\u2019m not coming to the bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think it\u2019ll be long?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no telling. She hasn\u2019t progressed very far yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan I bring you anything? Something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Jack, not for me. Doc can walk across the street if he wants to. But listen\u2014my instinct tells me maybe he shouldn\u2019t have a whiskey tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about Doc\u2014his instincts are pretty good, too. Mel? My door will be unlocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we finish up before morning, I\u2019ll sneak into your room. Would that be all right?\u201d</p><p>He laughed his low, sexy laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s always all right, Melinda. I might not be able to sleep for hoping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hope, too\u2014but for Anne\u2019s sake, not yours or mine.\u201d</p><p>Anne\u2019s blood pressure was stable and her labor was difficult. Three hours later, in spite of walking, squatting and laboring, she was still only at four centimeters. At midnight she was at a possible five. Doc suggested a Pitocin drip and breaking her water, which Mel had just been considering. Her contractions were coming every two minutes. Near midnight Mel checked her and with great relief, found that she had progressed to eight centimeters. But then, just thirty minutes later, she was back at five. Mel had been down this road before\u2014the cervix had swollen and appeared as though it was shrinking. That indicated they might not be able to have a vaginal birth. She examined Anne during a contraction when her cervix widened and literally tried to hold her cervix open to the great discomfort of the patient, but it just wasn\u2019t working. Anne was wet with sweat and growing more exhausted by the minute. It was three-thirty in the morning when Mel made the call to John Stone. \u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry to do this to you,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a delivery that might be going south. I\u2019ve got a patient who\u2019s been laboring for hours, stuck at five. Her cervix advanced to eight and swelled back to five. She\u2019s not progressing. We could ride this out, but mother is wilting and I have no indication that...I think it\u2019s very possible the baby\u2019s not going to fit. I suspect I\u2019m going to need a caesarian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pit her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. Pitocin running and I broke her water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, stop the pit, turn her on her left side. How long has she been laboring, stuck at four or five?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen hours with me. She labored at home for about eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tried stretching the cervix?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnsuccessfully,\u201d she said. \u201cOur ultrasound at your clinic showed a competent pelvis and average-size baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings change,\u201d he said. \u201cAny fetal distress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. The doptone shows a strong, regular, even heart rate, but mother\u2019s pressure is up a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could ride this out awhile, but if she\u2019s exhausted, I vote for not waiting. I\u2019ll meet you at Valley. Can you make the drive or do you need helicopter transport?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got some real good shocks on that Hummer,\u201d she said. \u201cEither way, she\u2019s an hour or more from the hospital. I\u2019ll wake Jack. Get his help.\u201d</p><p>Mel checked Anne once more; she had finally made six centimeters, but she was weakening. Anne\u2019s heart rate was increasing and the baby\u2019s had dropped just slightly. Jeremy was growing nervous and pale despite the number of times Mel reassured him that this wasn\u2019t unusual. It was starting to look like even if the baby was going to fit, Anne might not have the energy to push him out.</p><p>It was 4:00 a.m. when Mel called Jack. He didn\u2019t sound as though he\u2019d been asleep.</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2019m going to have to transport my patient to Valley Hospital for a caesarian. John\u2019s going to meet us there. I could use some help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe right there,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to get her downstairs and then if you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Mel,\u201d Jack said. \u201cLeave her where she is. I\u2019ll get her downstairs. I wouldn\u2019t want both of you to fall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sure. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Then she went back to her patient. Although Doc was standing by, this was Mel\u2019s case and a decision like this was entirely hers. \u201cAnne,\u201d she said, gently brushing the hair away from her soaking brow. \u201cWe\u2019re going to transport you to Valley Hospital for a C-section....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNooo,\u201d she cried. \u201cI want to have the baby normally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing abnormal about a C-section,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good operation, and it keeps you and the baby out of distress. Fortunately, we have the time so you\u2019re not at major risk. But with the distance to the hospital, we shouldn\u2019t wait until you are. It\u2019s going to be fine, Anne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she cried.</p><p>Then she was gripped by another hard contraction and fear gave way to pain. Her husband tried the breathing with her, but after all these hours of hard labor, it was futile. She had very little space between contractions and some residual pain that made it feel, to her, as if her contractions were continual, back to back. Mel had had tough deliveries before, but it was different in the hospital, when you could just wheel your patient down the hall to surgery and let the surgeons and anesthesiologist take over; in a hospital she would give the mother every chance to make it through, if she wanted to try. It was different for her here, when the hospital was so far away, staffed and equipped for only routine procedures and surgeries. She couldn\u2019t help but feel very disappointed for Anne, who had so looked forward to a natural childbirth with her husband.</p><p>\u201cAnne, it\u2019s just one of those things. Sometimes a C-section is the best answer,\u201d Mel said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to have this baby here, but we want you to have as many healthy births as you desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re right,\u201d she answered breathlessly.</p><p>Mel heard the front door open, Jack\u2019s feet on the stairs and then his voice outside the door. \u201cMel?\u201d</p><p>She pushed the door open.</p><p>\u201cLet me take her down for you. I\u2019ll drive you to the hospital in the Hummer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Come in. Just let her get through this next contraction.\u201d</p><p>Jack stepped into the room and nodded at Jeremy. \u201cHow you doing, man?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to carry your wife downstairs for you\u2014you look pretty exhausted. You and Mel can ride in back with her and I\u2019ll drive.\u201d As soon as Anne seemed to relax a bit, Jack bent over the bed and lifted her easily into his arms. \u201cHang on, kiddo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll get you down before the next one hits, how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Mel grabbed her bag and said, \u201cJeremy, please get Anne\u2019s suitcase.\u201d She followed Jack downstairs, grabbed her coat and while Jack held Anne, she opened up the back of the Hummer and slid out the gurney. \u201cAnne, I want you on your left side, please.\u201d</p><p>Once she was situated, Mel and Jeremy climbed in on either side of her, kneeling, while Jack got behind the wheel and took off in the direction of Valley Hospital. Mel kept the fetoscope handy and blood pressure cuff on Anne\u2019s upper arm. She checked her pressure and the fetal heartbeat every few minutes. They were nearly halfway when she reached forward and put a thankful hand on Jack\u2019s shoulder. His hand automatically came up to cover hers. \u201cYou were still awake,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cIn case you needed anything,\u201d he answered.</p><p>She gently squeezed his shoulder, but what she really wanted to do was throw her arms around him. She so appreciated the way he instinctively supported her in her work.</p><p>When they got to the hospital they entered the emergency room and, once inside, Mel handed Jack her coat and said, \u201cYou should move the SUV. Jeremy and I will take her up to labor and delivery. John\u2019s meeting us. I hate to ask you, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll wait. I\u2019ll be right here. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I going to be allowed in?\u201d Jeremy asked while they were in the elevator.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be up to Dr. Stone,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it were up to me, I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it.\u201d</p><p>Mel pushed the gurney through the swinging doors and was very happy to see John standing at the sink, finishing his scrub. Hands held up, he turned toward her and gave a nod and a smile. \u201cNumber two is set up, Mel. The anesthesiologist is here.\u201d</p><p>Beside him at the adjoining sink, pumping the faucet pedal with her foot, was a nurse in scrubs, her mask tied around her neck. She looked over at Mel and with a sarcastic twist of her lips, said, \u201cAnother botched home birth?\u201d</p><p>Mel\u2019s mouth dropped open and her eyes widened as if slapped. John whirled on the nurse, glaring at her. Then John turned back to Mel and said, \u201cCan you scrub in with me, Mel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m prepared to assist, Dr. Stone,\u201d the nurse said from behind him.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Juliette, but I\u2019m leaning toward someone more professional. You and I will talk later.\u201d And to Mel, \u201cYou have less than fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly. Jeremy wants to be there,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Juliette, find the father some scrubs. Mel, you\u2019ll find some in the locker room. Shake a leg.\u201d</p><p>Mel pushed the gurney to operating room number two and let the circulating nurse pull Anne into the room. She donned green scrubs in the locker room and joined Jeremy at the sink, saying, \u201cIf you scrub in, the doctor might be inclined to let you hold your son when he\u2019s born. Just like this,\u201d she said, demonstrating the scrubbing technique. \u201cNo guarantees on that, so no pouting. And you\u2019ll have to stay at Anne\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you done this before?\u201d he asked her. \u201cAssisted in a C-section?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany times,\u201d she said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cMel?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t botched, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. What Anne experienced wasn\u2019t all that unusual. You were there, Jeremy. You see anything happen that bothered you? I trust you would\u2019ve said something or at least asked a question or two.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cYou have one stubborn little boy to raise. Fortunately, we have a very good surgeon at our disposal.\u201d</p><p>By the time they entered the operating room, Anne had received her spinal from the anesthesiologist and was much more comfortable. John was ready to begin and Mel took her place next to him, her instruments lying out on the mayo stand.</p> <p>\u201cScalpel,\u201d he said.</p><p>She slapped it into his hand. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cFor what you did out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good nurse, but I never figured her for jealous. I apologize for her. We\u2019re ready to retract,\u201d he said. He chuckled. \u201cYou do a damn fine job, Mel. I\u2019d let you deliver my wife in a second.\u201d</p><p>The ride back to Virgin River wasn\u2019t exactly quiet\u2014Jeremy was a literal motormouth. Jack heard the details of the surgery several times. While Jeremy\u2019s wife was in recovery and his son in the nursery, he needed a lift home to fetch his own vehicle so he could go back. He chattered while Jack drove, and Mel\u2019s head lolled on the seat beside him.</p><p>\u201cExhausted, baby?\u201d he asked her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine after a nap,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMel assisted Dr. Stone,\u201d Jeremy sounded from the back. \u201cHe asked her to. It was incredible. The things she knows how to do.\u201d</p><p>Jack glanced over at her and smiled. \u201cYou know what\u2019s incredible, Jeremy?\u201d Jack said. He reached over and squeezed her thigh. \u201cShe never surprises me.\u201d</p><p>It was 9:00 a.m. before they got back to Virgin River. Mel checked in with Doc.</p><p>\u201cMother and baby came through very well. John Stone is a wonderful, fast surgeon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood call,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a city girl.\u201d And then he treated her to a rare smile. She found there were only three people scheduled for morning appointments and Doc was more than capable. She had asked Jack to give her a call in five or six hours\u2014she didn\u2019t want to sleep all day or she wouldn\u2019t sleep that night. But the labor and delivery had been taxing and she was spent.</p> <p>Jack helped Preacher serve lunch, then he went to the river to fish for a couple of hours. He had a lot on his mind. It hadn\u2019t escaped him that Mel had been moody lately. He\u2019d seen suspicious evidence of tears. And she wasn\u2019t drinking that end-ofthe-day beer\u2014she played with it for a little while before pushing it aside and asking for ice water.</p><p>At about three in the afternoon, while Preacher worked on preparing the evening meal, he went out to the cabin. He took off his boots on the front porch and tiptoed into the house. He stripped down to his boxers and slipped into the bed beside her, gently kissing her neck. She stirred slightly, turned her head and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cNow this is a good way to wake up,\u201d she murmured, closing her eyes again and snuggling closer to him.</p><p>He held her for a long while, then his hands began to move. Softly and sweetly. Before even seconds passed, her hands began to move, as well, and she pressed herself against him. When she began to strain against him, he got rid of the T-shirt she slept in and the boxers he still wore. He made gentle love to her, careful to keep her comfortable and safe, even as she picked up that eager pace, that frenetic yearning that drove him wild. He knew her body as well as she did herself by now, and he knew exactly what gave her the most pleasure.</p><p>She settled back to earth slowly. \u201cI thought you were going to call,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always know what to do,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot always,\u201d he said, holding her close. \u201cRight now, for example. I\u2019m not sure what to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, her eyes still closed, her face buried in his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cTell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Jack, you know the baby and mother are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby inside of you,\u201d he said, placing a large hand over her flat tummy. A startled look crossed her features. She pushed him away a little bit. \u201cDid someone say something to you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one had to say anything. Please tell me I\u2019m not the last to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just saw John yesterday\u2014and how in the world would you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d he said, running the back of one knuckle along her cheek. \u201cYour body\u2019s changing. You haven\u2019t had a period. For a while, I thought maybe you\u2019d had a hysterectomy or something because I haven\u2019t noticed a period since the first time we made love, but there\u2019s a blue box under the bathroom sink. You don\u2019t drink your beer, and you get nauseous from time to time. Not to mention being more tired than usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord,\u201d she said. \u201cYou never think a man will notice. Not things like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI went to see John yesterday to confirm what I already suspected. I\u2019m pregnant. Three months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a midwife. How could you not know at three weeks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I assumed I was sterile. Infertile. Mark and I did everything to try to get a baby\u2014even in vitro fertilization. To no avail. This was the last thing I ever expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, finally clear on why she might keep it from him. \u201cSo, here we are,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jack. You must think I\u2019m an idiot.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. \u201cOf course not. Mel, I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>She was frozen for a second. \u201cOh, God,\u201d she finally said, plummeted into tears. \u201cOh, God, Jack!\u201d She buried her face in his chest and wept.</p><p>\u201cHey, no reason to cry, baby. You a little surprised? No more than me,\u201d he laughed. \u201cI never thought this could happen to me. It hit me so hard, I damn near fell down. But I love you.\u201d She continued to softly cry. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, honey. It\u2019ll be okay.\u201d He stroked her hair. \u201cYou want to have a baby, obviously.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head. \u201cI wanted a baby so badly, I ached. But do you?\u201d she asked. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re forty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want everything with you. Everything. Besides, I like babies. And I\u2019m wild about pregnant women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you decide you knew for sure?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cAt least a month ago.\u201d He put a hand over her breast. \u201cSore? Haven\u2019t you noticed the changes? Your nipples have darkened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in denial,\u201d she said, wiping at her tears. \u201cI was so desperate for a baby\u2014but I had accepted that it couldn\u2019t happen. I wouldn\u2019t have done it this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how would you have done it, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I thought it even remotely possible I could get pregnant, I would have at least been sure you wanted a family, so that we could make a decision like this together. Fully informed. So if it happened, it would be okay. I hate that you\u2019ve had this thrust on you. With no warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t going to happen, not under the circumstances. It never would have occurred to you to try for a baby\u2014convinced it was impossible. So\u2014maybe it\u2019s a good thing it just happened like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if it had gone the other way? What if I told you the thing I wanted most in the world was a baby, asked you to try for one with me?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her a little closer. \u201cI\u2019d have been happy to help out.\u201d Then he smiled into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. You just accept everything. You\u2019re amazing. I thought you might be very pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. The only thing that disappoints me is that it took me this long to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven with all my baggage?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t consider this baggage.\u201d He leaned over and kissed her belly. \u201cI consider this the grand prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d he said. \u201cI want it. It makes me happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d she said in a breath. \u201cI was afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf you saying, \u2018Holy shit\u2014I\u2019m forty! What do I want with a baby?\u2019\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that, did I? Nah, I\u2019m ready. A family sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m still afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf believing in us. My last stab at something like this ended so, so badly. I thought I\u2019d never get over it. I\u2019m not sure I am yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re just going to have to take a leap of faith,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI think I can do that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re there to catch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t let you down yet, have I?\u201d</p><p>She put her hand against his face. \u201cNo, Jack. You sure haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jack had seen his brothers-in-law, all puffed up with testosterone pride when they\u2019d gotten their wives pregnant, when the babies came. He never pretended to really understand it. He was too busy with his career, with his troops, when it seemed to him a woman getting pregnant was probably the worst career suicide a man could suffer. He didn\u2019t get their male egos; he thought his sisters were just getting fat and mean. He got it now. He felt as though his chest might explode. There was a fire in his belly and it was all he could do to keep from running up a flag. He couldn\u2019t wait until he and Mel could make some plans, get married, tell the world they were lifetime partners and bringing a baby on board.</p><p>She shooed him out of the cabin, told him to go take care of the dinner crowd while she showered off that long night with a patient. She promised to drive into town to have a diet cola at the bar and tell those present that Anne and Jeremy and their baby boy were doing fine. Then later, they\u2019d go back home together. He was almost to town when he turned around to go back. Preacher might get testy, being stuck with the bar and cooking, too, but he just had to hold her for a minute more. He tiptoed up the porch steps, took off his boots, and silently opened the door. He expected to hear the shower running, but instead he heard her weeping.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she was saying through her tears. \u201cI\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201d Then she sobbed briefly. \u201cI never planned this. Oh, Mark, please understand...\u201d</p><p>He stole a peek into the bedroom and saw Mel sitting on the edge of her bed, talking to the picture of her dead husband. It cut through him like a knife; damn near ripped his heart out.</p><p>\u201cPlease understand\u2014this was the last thing I expected,\u201d she cried. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way it happened, and it took me by surprise. Total surprise. I promise I\u2019ll never forget you!\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and she jumped. She looked at him, tears running down her cheeks. \u201cJack!\u201d she gasped.</p><p>He held up a hand. \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can work this out with Mark. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>He turned to leave and she ran after him, tugging on his shirt. \u201cJack, please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mel,\u201d he said, profound sadness showing in his eyes. He forced a smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as if I didn\u2019t know what I was up against.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You don\u2019t understand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do,\u201d he said, tenderly touching her cheek. \u201cTake your time. I\u2019m not going anywhere. Except back to the bar. I think I need a drink.\u201d</p><p>Jack walked out of the cabin, collected his boots on her porch and got back into his truck. So, he thought. Probably the best day of my life, turned to total shit. She\u2019s still back there, with him. She can love you like she\u2019s yours, but she\u2019s not. Not yet. Hadn\u2019t he always known this was the risk he was taking, as long as he loved her? That she might not be able to let go of him? Ever? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>What the hell, he told himself. She might never really belong to me; good thing he can\u2019t come back from the grave and snatch her away. But that baby is mine. And I want it. I want her. Whatever she has to spare...</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p> <p>M el showered, put on clean clothes and prepared to go to the bar to take her medicine. She felt terrible; her heart ached when she thought of the look in Jack\u2019s eyes. He never should have witnessed that performance. It must have shattered him. She could only hope he would forgive her.</p><p>She brought a change of clothes and her makeup for work the next day. If Jack didn\u2019t want to come back to her cabin with her, she would force her company on him. They had to get beyond this. This was her fault. It wasn\u2019t just the two of them anymore. He wanted this baby. He wanted her and the baby. She was going to find a way to make this right.</p><p>There were only about a dozen customers in the bar when she got there\u2014the Bristols and Carpenters sitting at a table for four, Hope and Doc at the bar, a couple of men playing cribbage with a pitcher of beer, and a young family. Jack stood behind the bar and lifted his chin slightly in greeting as she entered. It was a very subdued gesture; there was going to be penance to pay.</p><p>She stopped and chatted briefly with the Bristols and Carpenters, filling them in on the Givens baby, before going to the bar. She got onto the stool next to Doc. \u201cDid you get any rest today?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t sleep in daylight,\u201d he grumbled. He popped an antacid and Jack put a whiskey in front of him.</p> <p>\u201cLong night?\u201d Hope asked her.</p><p>\u201cLong night for the Givenses,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood work, Mel,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew I was smart to get you up here.\u201d She stubbed out her cigarette and left, chatting her way out the door.</p><p>Without being asked, Jack put a cola in front of her. She mouthed the words, I\u2019m sorry. His lips curved just slightly, hurt in his eyes, but he leaned toward her and placed a gentle kiss on her brow. Ow, she thought. This is bad. And it just got worse. They had only the most superficial conversation while Mel picked at her dinner, but determined, she waited out the emptying of the bar. It was eight o\u2019clock by the time Preacher was sweeping the floor and Jack was putting up clean glasses. \u201cAre we going to talk about it?\u201d she quietly asked Jack.</p><p>\u201cHow about we let it go and move forward,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she whispered so that Preacher wouldn\u2019t hear. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s true. Please believe me.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her chin and put a light kiss on her lips. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she said, tears gathering in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Mel,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t start crying again. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t understand why\u2014</p><p>and it\u2019ll make things worse.\u201d</p><p>She sucked it back, forced herself to still the nerves that were tightening inside her. Her fleeting thought was, God, what will I do if he\u2019s through with me on account of that? \u201cI\u2019m going to your room,\u201d she told him. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay there until you come to me and I\u2019m going to convince you, somehow, that we belong to each other. Especially now.\u201d</p><p>He gave a nod that was so slight, it was almost imperceptible, so she got off her stool and walked through the back of the bar to his quarters. Once alone, she couldn\u2019t suppress the tears. They flowed freely down her cheeks. He thinks I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life explaining myself to my dead husband, apologizing for how I feel about Jack. Well, that\u2019s what I was doing\u2014what\u2019s he to think? He won\u2019t believe me if I tell him that\u2019s not true, not how it\u2019s going to be. It was just a one-time thing\u2014the shock, the exhaustion, the high emotional state I\u2019m in.</p> <p>Mel sat in the big chair in his room, revisiting in her mind that night she sat in this spot, drenched from the rain, and he gently undressed her, dried her and put her to bed. That was when she knew, without a doubt, there was a partner here for her, even if she couldn\u2019t admit it to herself for quite a while. Since the ultrasound, she was pretty convinced she had conceived that night. Jack opened her up, showed her passion she didn\u2019t know existed, and put his baby in her. It was nothing short of a miracle\u2014the love, the passion, the baby. She just didn\u2019t know how difficult it would be to make that transition into a new life. A second life. A completely different life. She sat in that chair for an hour. Waiting.</p><p>Jack put up all his clean glasses and dishes, wiped down the bar and poured himself a drink. There was a particular, old single malt, an aged Glenlivet, that he saved for special occasions. Or emergencies.</p><p>Preacher put away his broom and went to the bar. \u201cEverything okay, man?\u201d he asked. Jack pulled down a glass and poured a shot for his friend. He lifted his toward Preacher in something of a toast and said, solemnly, \u201cMel\u2019s pregnant.\u201d Then Jack took the shot in one swallow.</p><p>\u201cAw, man,\u201d Preacher said. \u201cWhat are you gonna do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be a father,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to marry her.\u201d</p><p>Preacher picked up his glass and lifted it tentatively, taking a drink. \u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat what you want, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Preacher grinned. \u201cSarge. A family man. Who\u2019d think?\u201d</p><p>Jack tipped the bottle once more, over both glasses. \u201cYeah,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cSeems like, maybe, things aren\u2019t so hot right now,\u201d Preacher said.</p><p>\u201cNah,\u201d he lied. \u201cJust found out,\u201d he further lied. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna work out great. It\u2019s gonna be perfect.\u201d Then he smiled. \u201cYou know I never do anything I don\u2019t want to do. Uncle Preacher.\u201d He threw back the second shot and put his glass on the bar. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>Jack felt bad about leaving Mel in his room for so long, but they both needed some time to compose themselves. If there were going to be more tears, this one time he wanted her to get that out of the way on her own. There\u2019s only so much one man could do, so he didn\u2019t rush to her. She was going to be feeling a little desperate\u2014</p><p>pregnant, just caught apologizing for it to the picture of Mark, afraid Jack wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with that. There was nothing either of them could do about it\u2014Jack had known from the beginning that Mark was still there, in her life, in her heart. He would never have all of her. Well, then, he\u2019d make the most of what he did have. He wasn\u2019t going to make her grovel; he was just going to love the heck out of her. He could manage this, even if it wasn\u2019t the most ideal situation. In time, maybe she\u2019d come around. Mark\u2019s memory could fade enough so that even if Jack wasn\u2019t the only man in her life, he would come to feel like the most important one. Maybe when she held their child, she would realize life was for the living.</p><p>He walked in, looked across the room at her, and leaned down to pull off his boots. He yanked his shirt out of his pants and took it off, hanging it on the peg in his closet. He removed his belt and tossed it aside. Then he approached her and put out a hand to her.</p><p>She put her hand in his and let him draw her to her feet. She leaned her head against his chest and said again, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I love you. I want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>His arms went around her and he answered. \u201cThat\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d</p><p>Jack kissed her tenderly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a couple of drinks,\u201d she said. \u201cScotch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seemed like the thing to do,\u201d he said. He slowly began to undress her, leaving her clothes in a pile on the floor, because when words failed him he had never failed to be able to speak to her body. There was no confusion about this\u2014when he touched her, she was all his. When she responded to him, she held nothing back. There might be a glitch in her heart, some of it stuck in the past. But her body came alive under his lips, his hands.</p><p>He carried her to his bed, lay her sweetly on the sheets and went to work on her. He touched her, kissed and caressed her in the ways he knew filled her up, pleased her, gave her joy, released her. She rose to him, hot and ready, wrapping herself around him, giving. Taking. Crying out.</p><p>God, he didn\u2019t know he could want this much. Love this much. Okay, he thought\u2014here\u2019s the reality. He would always have this. He would make her body sing just as she sent him reeling into the most incredible madness a man can feel. He would hold her every night and wake up with her every morning and there would be many times, like this, when they would come together in this incomparable passion and no matter what else was going on, this mutual joy belonged only to them. Just the two of them. There were no ghosts present in these moments. Sufficient compensation. Sweet consolation.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she said, snuggled up against him. \u201cI hate that I hurt you.\u201d</p><p>He buried his face in her hair and inhaled the sweet scent. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about that anymore. It\u2019s behind us. We have a lot in front of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be a good idea for me to go to Joey for a little while? Give you some space?</p><p>Try to get my head together?\u201d</p><p>He rose over her and looked into her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t, Mel. Don\u2019t run just because we hit a rough patch. We\u2019ll work through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d he said hoarsely, his voice a mere whisper, \u201cyou have my baby inside you. I have to be a part of that. Come on...\u201d</p><p>She fought the tears that threatened. \u201cI know it must be hard to deal with an emotional basket case like me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her and said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard that pregnant women get like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m just like that, period.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry me,\u201d he said.</p><p>She touched his beautiful face. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelinda, six months ago we were two people without attachments. Two people who had accepted we would never have any\u2014and that we\u2019d never have families. Now we have it all. We have each other and a baby. A baby we both want. Let\u2019s not screw this up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been more sure about anything. I want this. If you can\u2019t stay here, I\u2019ll go anywhere you want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Jack, you love it here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you realize I love you more? I need you in my life. You and our baby. God, Mel\u2014I don\u2019t care where that happens. As long as it happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d she said in a whisper. \u201cWhat if you change your mind? What if something happens? You have to remember, I never thought anything terrible would happen to\u2014</p><p>\u201d</p><p>He put a finger on her lips, stopping her. He didn\u2019t want to hear his name. Not now.</p><p>\u201cShhh,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to trust me. You know you\u2019re safe with me.\u201d</p><p>Mel awoke humming. The song this morning was \u201cMamma Mia\u201d by ABBA, of all things. It made her smile. She got out of bed and showered. When she came out of the shower and put on one of Jack\u2019s shirts, she found a steaming cup of coffee on the bathroom counter. There was a note under it. Half-caf. Daddy. Jack was already up and in the bar, taking care of breakfast. Taking care of her. Robbing her of caffeine. She dressed for the day; she had been so out of focus lately, she had no idea what kind of schedule lay ahead. She couldn\u2019t remember making any appointments for the morning. Still, she wasn\u2019t rushing to Doc\u2019s. It was early and she had a very important phone call to make.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could see the look on your face when I tell you this, Joey,\u201d Mel said. \u201cI hope you\u2019re sitting down. I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>There was a gasp, then silence.</p><p>\u201cPregnant,\u201d she said again. \u201cTotally knocked up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cOh, my God! Mel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Kind of blew my mind, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree months? Let\u2019s see...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother trying to do the math. I haven\u2019t had a period since he touched me for the first time. I guess he\u2019s potent enough for both of us. At first, I thought it so impossible, an absurd fantasy. I figured I was late because of stress, change, how weird my life is. But it\u2019s real. I had an ultrasound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel! How is this possible?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me\u2014stranger things have happened. But not around here, apparently. I\u2019m surrounded by women who were pretty sure they couldn\u2019t get pregnant and voila!</p><p>There\u2019s a rumor about the water...I\u2019m thinking of calling my L.A. infertility specialist to tell him about this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to marry Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel\u2014do you love him?\u201d Joey asked, her voice subdued. Cautious. Mel drew in a breath, trying to calm her voice, which she knew would be tremulous and emotional. \u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cJoey, I love him so much, I almost ache with it. I never thought I could love this much. I was in denial about that for a while, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel,\u201d Joey said, then began to cry. \u201cOh, my sweet baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt made me feel guilty, like I was doing something wrong\u2014I was so committed to the idea that I\u2019d lost my one true love and would never feel anything even close to that again in my life. I never considered the possibility that I might find something even more powerful. It seemed, briefly, like a betrayal. Jack even caught me crying to Mark\u2019s picture that I was sorry, that I didn\u2019t expect it to happen, and promising never to forget him. God. It was an awful moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby girl, you haven\u2019t done anything wrong. You\u2019ve been through such a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, in my sane state, I know that. Jack knew about my problems, and he just hung in there, just kept loving me and loving me, putting all my needs ahead of his own, promising me I\u2019d be safe with him, that I could trust him. Oh, God,\u201d she said, tears coming in spite of the fact that she was so, so happy. \u201cGod, he\u2019s wonderful. Joey,\u201d she said in a near whisper, \u201che wants the baby as much as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is just unbelievable. When are you getting married? Because we\u2019re going to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had a chance to even talk about it\u2014I just broke it to him yesterday and he asked me last night. I\u2019ll let you know when I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut does this mean you\u2019re staying there?\u201d</p><p>Mel laughed. \u201cYou were right, you know\u2014coming here was completely crazy. It was irrational. To think I\u2019d choose to go to a town where there\u2019s no mall, much less a day spa, and one restaurant that doesn\u2019t have a menu? Please. No medical technology, ambulance service or local police\u2014how is it I thought that would be easier, less stressful? I almost slid off the mountain on my way into town!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...Mel...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even have cable, no cell phone signal most of the time. And there\u2019s not a single person here who can admire my Cole Haan boots which, by the way, are starting to look like crap from traipsing around forests and farms. Did you know that any critical illness or injury has to be airlifted out of here? A person would be crazy to find this relaxing. Renewing.\u201d She laughed. \u201cThe state I was in, when I was leaving L.A., I thought I absolutely had to escape all the challenges. It never occurred to me that challenge would be good for me. A completely new challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I told Jack I was pregnant, after promising him I had the birth control taken care of, he should have said, \u2018I\u2019m outta here, babe.\u2019 But you know what he said? He said, \u2018I have to have you and the baby in my life, and if you can\u2019t stay here, I\u2019ll go anywhere.\u2019\u201d She sniffed a little and a tear rolled down her cheek. \u201cWhen I wake up in the morning, the first thing I do is check to see if there are deer in the yard. Then I wonder what Preacher\u2019s in the mood to fix for dinner. Jack\u2019s usually already gone back to town\u2014he likes splitting logs in the early morning\u2014half the town wakes up to the sound of his ax striking wood. I see him five or ten times through the day and he always looks at me like we\u2019ve been apart for a year. If I have a patient in labor, he stays up all night, just in case I need something. And when there are no patients at night, when he holds me before I fall asleep, bad TV reception is the last thing on my mind.</p><p>\u201cAm I staying here? I came here because I believed I\u2019d lost everything that mattered, and ended up finding everything I\u2019ve ever wanted in the world. Yeah, Joey. I\u2019m staying. Jack\u2019s here. Besides, I belong here now. I belong to them. They belong to me.\u201d</p><p>Right after a light breakfast, she headed for Doc\u2019s. She supposed it was in order to tell him right away, but when she walked into the house, she was greeted by quiet. Good, she thought. No patients yet. She went to Doc\u2019s office and tapped lightly on the door, then pushed it open. He was sitting in the chair at his desk, leaning back, his eyes closed. Hmm. Doesn\u2019t sleep in daylight, huh? She stood over him. It was good to see Doc docile for once.</p><p>Mel was about to leave and wait for a better time, but something made her take a closer look at Doc. His eyes were pinched closed, his face in a grimace and his coloring wasn\u2019t right. He was gray. She reached down and squeezed his wrist with the forefingers of one hand. His pulse was racing. Mel felt Doc\u2019s brow and found his skin clammy. His eyes opened into slits. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cHeartburn.\u201d</p><p>Heartburn does not make your pulse race and your skin clammy, she thought. She ran for the stethoscope and blood pressure cuff in the exam room, returning to him. \u201cYou going to tell me what it is\u2014or make me guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you...Nothing. I\u2019ll be fine in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>She took his blood pressure, though she had to struggle with him for cooperation.</p><p>\u201cDid you have breakfast?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cA while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have? Bacon and eggs? Sausage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that great. Preacher\u2019s a little off on the cooking...\u201d</p><p>His blood pressure was elevated. \u201cAny chest pains?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She palpated his abdomen, although excess lipid tissue on his pot belly made it impossible to feel his internal organs while he was sitting upright. And he slapped at her hand, trying to push her away. But as she palpated, he grunted in pain. \u201cHow many of them have you had?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cHow many what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAttacks. Like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne or two,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to the nice little nurse,\u201d she chastised. \u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d</p><p>She pulled the lids back on his eyes and they had begun to yellow. He was jaundicing.</p><p>\u201cYou waiting for your liver to blow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>He was having a major league gallbladder attack, and she wasn\u2019t sure that was all. She didn\u2019t even think about it\u2014she picked up the phone and called the bar. \u201cJack,\u201d she said, \u201ccome over, please. I have to get Doc to the hospital.\u201d And she hung up.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Doc said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you argue with me now, I\u2019ll get Jack and Preacher to put you in a fireman\u2019s carry and dump you in the Hummer. That should make your belly feel good.\u201d She looked at his face. \u201cHow\u2019s your back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrible. This one is kind of bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting jaundiced, Doc,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait. I suspect you\u2019re in a biliary crisis. I\u2019m going to start an IV and I don\u2019t want any lip.\u201d</p><p>Before she could get the needle in, both Jack and Preacher arrived. \u201cWe\u2019ll get him in the car and I\u2019ll drive you,\u201d Jack said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a gallbladder attack, but he\u2019s not talking. It\u2019s serious. His blood pressure is up and he\u2019s in terrible pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaste of time,\u201d Doc said. \u201cIt\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease be still,\u201d she implored. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to ask these big boys to hold you down.\u201d</p><p>Once the IV was in, she made a mad dash to the drug cabinet while Jack and Preacher each got on either side of him, walking him slowly out the door, Jack holding the Ringer\u2019s over his head. When they got to the Hummer she joined them. Doc said,</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBad enough sitting up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then, we\u2019ll take out the gurney and put up the backseat. I\u2019ll pull the IV bag hook forward and sit beside you. Have you taken anything for the pain yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just starting to have very kind thoughts toward morphine,\u201d he said. Jack adjusted the backseat, leaving the gurney on Doc\u2019s porch. Doc climbed clumsily into the backseat. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have good enough drugs,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cCan you make it to the hospital without drugs? Give the doctor a clean slate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrrggghhh,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cIf you insist, I\u2019ll give you something\u2014but it would be better to let the E.R. decide what\u2019s best.\u201d She took a breath. \u201cI grabbed some morphine.\u201d</p><p>He peered at her through slits. \u201cHit me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just god-awful.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and drew up a syringe from the vial in her bag, putting it right into the IV. It took only moments for him to say, \u201cAhhh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen anyone about this?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a doctor, young woman. I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a clinic in Garberville,\u201d Jack said as he started the car. \u201cIt\u2019s closer than Valley Hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to need a surgeon,\u201d Mel informed him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to need surgery,\u201d the old boy argued.</p><p>\u201cYou a betting man?\u201d was all she said.</p><p>Doc Mullins rested a bit easier with the narcotic in him, which was good since it was over an hour, even with Jack\u2019s fast and skillful driving. It wasn\u2019t the distance so much as the roads\u2014just getting to the county road that connected with the highway twisted and turned and was slow going. Mel watched out the window, remembering that first night she came here, terrified of these sharp twists and turns, the sheer drops, steep climbs. Now, with Jack managing the Hummer, she was comfortable. Before long they were out of the hills and speeding through the valley. With her attention focused on Doc, she couldn\u2019t fully appreciate the landscape. It did occur to her, however, that every time she traveled anywhere around this county, she was amazed by the beauty as if seeing it for the first time.</p><p>She had a fleeting thought that if anything bad happened to Doc, it would be down to only her. How was she going to have a baby and take care of a town?</p><p>She thought about Joey\u2019s question\u2014are you staying there? It made her smile. It would hardly seem a punishment to live out her life in this glorious place. This was only Mel\u2019s second visit to the emergency room\u2014the first was with Connie. She had taken Jeremy and Anne to labor and delivery the night the baby came, so she didn\u2019t really know the staff in E.R. They all knew Doc, however. He\u2019d been putting in regular appearances there for upwards of forty years. And they greeted Mel very enthusiastically, as if she were an old friend. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Doc was not one to allow fussing; he made it plain he didn\u2019t think he needed to be there. Mel and Jack were seated outside the exam room while the emergency room doctor checked him over. Then another doctor went into the exam room and Doc was heard to bellow, \u201cAw, for Christ\u2019s sake! Can\u2019t I get a better surgeon than you? I don\u2019t want to die on the goddamn table!\u201d</p><p>Mel blanched, but she saw that some of the staff was chuckling. After a bit the surgeon came out to them. He had a smile on his face. He held out his hand. \u201cDr. Simon, Miss...?\u201d</p> <p>She stood and took his hand. \u201cMonroe,\u201d she said. \u201cMel Monroe. I work with Doc. Is he going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think so. Doctors. Great patients, aren\u2019t we? I\u2019m going to admit him and that gallbladder has to come out, but we can\u2019t take him into surgery until we get him out of this biliary crisis. That could take a day or week. Good call, Miss Monroe. I assume he didn\u2019t assist you a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried not to. May I see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>She found Doc in a raised position in the bed while the nurse was fiddling with the IV. The E.R. doctor was writing in the chart and when he saw her, gave a nod of hello. And on Doc\u2019s face was the unhappy expression she had come to view with fondness. Mel looked around the E.R.\u2014far smaller and less crowded than the one she was used to in L.A. Still, memories flooded back to her\u2014the days and nights she had spent working in that environment. The adrenaline rush of emergencies; the edgy environment that had excited and stimulated her. At the nurses\u2019 station a young doctor was bent over a nurse, reading over her shoulder, making her laugh at some whispered remark. That could have been Mel and Mark a few years ago. She let her eyes slowly close as she realized that she had moved completely beyond that. That familiar pang of longing did not plague her anymore. Now the only man she longed for waited for her just outside this room, prepared to go through anything with her. Her hand crept absently to her tummy, resting there. It was all right, she realized. What I suffered was very bad; what I have is very good.</p> <p>\u201cYoung woman,\u201d Doc snapped. \u201cYou gonna be sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d she said, coming out of the haze. \u201cNo. Of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a minute there you looked like you were going to cry. Or puke.\u201d</p><p>She just smiled at him. \u201cSorry. I was on another planet there for a second. Are you feeling better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll live. You\u2019d better go. There might be patients back at the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back for your surgery,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m probably going to die in surgery anyway with that young pup cutting me up\u2014you\u2019re needed back in Virgin River. Someone has to look after things. I guess you\u2019re in charge. God help us all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call to see how you\u2019re doing, and I will come back when you have surgery. And Doc? Try to behave yourself. Try not to get thrown out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAch,\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>She put her small cool hand on his wizened brow. \u201cFeel better. I\u2019ll watch your practice.\u201d</p><p>In an uncharacteristically soft voice, she heard him say, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>On the drive back to Virgin River Mel said, \u201cHe\u2019s going to need time to recover before he can start seeing patients again. I suppose I\u2019ll be staying at his house for a while after he gets home.\u201d</p><p>Doc\u2019s age, weight and blood pressure put him at a disadvantage in both surgery and recovery. It was a week before the surgeon could operate, and while the normal hospital stay for a cholesystectomy was brief\u2014couple of days at most\u2014they kept Doc for another week.</p><p>For those two weeks, Mel drove back and forth to Valley Hospital to check on him, plus managed the meager amount of patient care in Virgin River. June and John offered assistance, should she need it, but she was holding up fine. She stayed at the clinic during the days, spent her nights with Jack across the street, and the only huge inconvenience was planning and executing a wedding.</p> <p>Jack told his dad and sisters that he and Mel were marrying, news which was met with much approval and excitement. He saved the news about the baby; he wanted to see the looks on their faces when they found out. Since there were no inns or motels in Virgin River, the couple decided they\u2019d have a small, family-only wedding in Sacramento as soon as possible\u2014at the Sheridan house. Jack told his sisters to plan something simple, quiet and quick for three weeks from the date Doc had gone into the hospital. He and Mel would drive down, tie the knot, and hurry home. \u201cWhat about a honeymoon?\u201d Sam asked.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that,\u201d Jack said. And what he thought was, I\u2019m going to be on a honeymoon for the rest of my life.</p><p>Rick took the news of the pregnancy and fast approaching marriage with a bit of shock. \u201cYou okay with this?\u201d he asked Jack.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Big time. I\u2019m ready for a family, Rick.\u201d He put his hand around the back of the boy\u2019s neck and pulled him against his shoulder. \u201cIn addition to you and Preach, that is. You okay with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, man. You\u2019re not too young, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Then he grinned. \u201cI really thought she was out of your league.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is, buddy. But what the heck.\u201d</p><p>The evening before Mel was due to pick up Doc at Valley hospital and bring him home, Jack asked, \u201cDo you have to spend the nights at Doc\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably just for a few days\u2014long enough to make sure he\u2019s getting around all right. He\u2019s ambulatory at the hospital, but he\u2019s miserable. His grimace isn\u2019t just from being ornery at the moment. He\u2019ll need pain medication\u2014and I don\u2019t want him administering his own. He could get confused and overdose.\u201d</p><p>Jack sat in the big chair in his room and said, \u201cCome here,\u201d to Mel. She went to him and he pulled her down onto his lap. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d He pulled a small box out of his pocket, shocking her into silence. It was definitely a ring box. \u201cI don\u2019t know how practical this is in a place like Virgin River. It might be a little fussy. But I couldn\u2019t help myself. I want to give you everything\u2014but this will have to do.\u201d</p><p>She opened the box to find a diamond ring so beautiful it brought tears to her eyes. It was a wide gold band with three large diamonds set in; classy and understated, yet very rich and unique. \u201cJack, what were you thinking? This is beautiful! The diamonds are huge!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand if you can\u2019t wear it often, given your work. And if you don\u2019t like the design\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? It\u2019s gorgeous!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went ahead and got a band like it, no diamonds. Is that okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly perfect. Where in the world did you find this thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the Virgin River jewelry store, that\u2019s for sure. I had to drive over to the coast. Are you sure you like it?\u201d</p><p>She threw her arms around his neck. \u201cYou gave me a baby,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting this, too!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was giving you a baby,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cThis, I did on purpose.\u201d</p><p>She laughed at him and said, \u201cPeople will think we\u2019re uppity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMel\u2014I got it a while ago. When I first thought you might be pregnant. Probably before you did. Even if it had turned out you weren\u2019t, I was set on this. This idea to marry you, to have my life with you...It\u2019s not something I feel like I have to do. It\u2019s what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, how did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care how,\u201d he said.</p><p>He went with her the next day to pick up Doc and bring him home. Mel got him settled in his bed at home where he proved to be a very annoying patient; however, it seemed he would make a full recovery and be back to his old schedule in no time. He might not be seeing patients by the time Mel and Jack slipped down to Sacramento for a couple of days, but he\u2019d be able to look after himself.</p><p>Meanwhile, with all Mel had to do, running the clinic and looking after Doc, Jack, Preacher or Ricky were bringing his meals, and Mel was able to escape to the bar for an hour here and there, just for a change of scenery. Nights she spent in the hospital bed down the hall from Doc. Alone.</p><p>After just a few such nights, she was startled awake by noise downstairs. She sat up sleepily and listened. It was unusual, but not unheard of for someone to come pounding at the doctor\u2019s door after hours, so when Mel heard the knocking, she rolled over and looked at the clock. It was 1:00 a.m., which implied an emergency and as she was shrugging into her robe, she began to form contingency plans if she had to go out on a call. Jack could come to the house to look after Doc\u2014or maybe go with her, leaving Doc to sleep through till morning without her.</p><p>She remembered hearing about that near-fatal truck accident some years ago and thought, what if I\u2019m not enough help? Who could I call?</p><p>When she opened the front door, no one was there. Then the pounding came again and she realized that whoever it was had come to the back, to the kitchen door. She looked through the glass to see the face of that man from the compound. Calvin. If he was coming to fetch her out to that camp, she wouldn\u2019t go. She\u2019d have to send him away. If he\u2019d come to ask her for drugs, she thought she might have to call Jack. She opened the door with an excuse on her lips when he rushed her, the back of his forearm against her neck. He shoved her backward with enough force that she knocked over a chair, crashed into the countertop and sent coffee cups that were drying in the dish rack hurtling to the floor. He had a snarl on his lips, a glazed look in his eyes, and a big hunting knife in his hand. She screamed, a noise that was quickly cut off as he grabbed her by the hair and put the knife to her throat.</p><p>\u201cDrugs,\u201d he said simply. \u201cJust gimme what you got, then I\u2019m getting the hell out of these mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in there...I have to get the key,\u201d she said, indicating the drug cabinet.</p><p>\u201cForget it,\u201d he said. As he held her, he tried kicking the wooden door. The whole cabinet shook and wobbled; she could hear the contents bouncing around.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d she cried. \u201cYou\u2019ll break the vials! You want the drugs or not?\u201d</p><p>He stopped. \u201cWhere\u2019s the key?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIn the office.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her backward, flipped the lock on the back door and said, \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s move it.\u201d With one arm around her waist and the knife at her throat, he walked her out of the kitchen. She had no option but to lead him to the office. He held her in front of him, hostage style, as they slowly shuffled down the hall to the office. As she opened the drawer to reach for the key, he started to laugh. He grabbed her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take this,\u201d he said, pulling at her ring.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she cried, retreating. But he easily pulled her back by the hair and threatened her with the knife right in front of her face. She froze and let him pull off the ring.</p><p>He shoved it in his pocket and said, \u201cHurry up. I ain\u2019t got all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have anything you want.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAnd what if I want you, too?\u201d</p><p>She thought she might vomit on the spot. She willed herself to be brave, to be strong, to let this ordeal end.</p><p>But he was going to kill her. She knew who he was, what he\u2019d done, and suddenly she knew\u2014he was going to kill her. As soon as he had what he wanted, that knife would slice across her throat.</p><p>Lying on top of the desk were the Hummer keys, obvious by the trademark and remote. He scooped them up, put them in his pocket with the ring and steered her out of the office back toward the kitchen. And he muttered, \u201cAsshole doesn\u2019t pay me enough to sit in the woods with Maxine and a bunch of old bums. But this should catch me up.\u201d And then he laughed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>Jack rolled out of bed to answer the ringing phone. \u201cMel\u2019s in trouble,\u201d came Doc\u2019s gravelly voice. \u201cSomeone\u2019s trying to get in the back of the house. Downstairs. She\u2019s down there. Glass broke.\u201d</p><p>Jack dropped the phone and grabbed his jeans off the chair. No time for a shirt or shoes, he took his 9 mm handgun out of the holster that hung on a hook in the closet, checked to be sure it was loaded and that he had one in the chamber and bolted out the door. He crossed the street at a dead run. He didn\u2019t think\u2014he was on automatic. His jaw ground, his temples pulsed and his blood was roaring in his ears. There was an old truck at the clinic beside Doc\u2019s truck and Mel\u2019s Hummer. He knew exactly who was in there.</p><p>He looked into the front door window in time to see Calvin pushing Mel into the office, and they had come from the direction of the kitchen where the drug cabinet sat. He ran around to the back of the house and looked into the kitchen door window; they were still out of sight. Then they came back into view from down the hall and Jack ducked\u2014but not before he saw that Calvin had a big, serrated knife against her neck. He waited; he wasn\u2019t going to give him the time or opportunity to flee or to do any damage to Mel before fleeing. It was a long few seconds as he waited for them to get back into the kitchen. He could hear their movements, the man\u2019s hostile voice as he held Mel.</p> <p>They were almost to the drug cabinet when Jack kicked the door. It crashed open and bounced off the opposite wall, but he was already inside. Legs braced apart, arms raised, pistol pointed at the man who held his woman, he said, \u201cPut down the knife. Carefully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna let me out of here, and she\u2019ll come with me to be sure,\u201d Calvin said. Knife against her throat, Mel looked at Jack and saw a man she had never seen before. The expression on his face should be enough to terrify the man who held her. Bare chested, barefoot, his jeans zipped but not buttoned, his shoulders and arms frighteningly huge, big tattoos on his swollen biceps, he looked like a wild man. He looked over the barrel of the gun, his eyes narrow, and a set to his jaw told her he was going to act. There was no question. He did not look at Mel, but at Calvin. And for a woman terrified of guns, she was unafraid. She believed in him. She knew, in that instant, that he would risk his life for her, but he would never put her at risk. Never. If he was going to make a move, she wouldn\u2019t be in danger. Her expression went from frightened to trusting.</p><p>Jack had less than a four-inch target\u2014the left side of the man\u2019s head. Right next to that was Mel\u2019s head, Mel\u2019s beautiful face. At her throat, the blade. He didn\u2019t even have to think about it\u2014he wasn\u2019t going to lose her like this.</p><p>\u201cYou have one second.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Jack saw her cast a look his way, a look that in that split second told him she loved him, believed in him. Then her eyes dropped closed and her head dipped ever so slightly to the right.</p> <p>\u201cBack off, man\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jack took his shot, blowing the man backward, the knife flying out of his hand. Mel ran to Jack. The arm that held the gun was dangling at Jack\u2019s side and his other arm went around her. Jack held her close as she let out a long slow breath against his bare chest, clinging to him. He never took his eyes off the offender. A nice, neat hole was bored right into his head, a growing pool of blood spreading under him as he lay motionless.</p><p>They stood like that for a while, Mel trying to catch her breath and Jack watching. Ready. She pulled away enough to look up at him and was nearly startled anew by an expression so fierce, so angry. \u201cHe was going to kill me,\u201d she said in a whisper. His eyes remained on the man as he said, \u201cI will never let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>The sound of running footfalls came up behind them, but Jack didn\u2019t turn. Preacher stopped suddenly in the doorway, a hand braced on each side as he leaned in, panting. He looked into the kitchen, saw the man on the floor, Mel in Jack\u2019s protective embrace, the gun dangling at Jack\u2019s side. And Preacher\u2019s expression went dark, his brows drawn close, his mouth turned down in a scowl. He walked into the kitchen, kicked the knife across the floor and bent to the man. He felt the man\u2019s neck for a carotid pulse. He looked over his shoulder at Jack and shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jack. It\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>Jack put the gun on the table and, with Mel still protected against him, turned to the wall phone. He lifted the receiver, punched a few numbers and said, \u201cThis is Jack Sheridan in Virgin River. I\u2019m at Doc Mullins\u2019s\u2014I just killed a man.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p> <p>I t took the sheriff\u2019s deputy, Henry Depardeau, longer to arrive in Virgin River than it took him to determine that Jack had acted in defense of Mel, whose life was in danger. Just the same, Jack\u2019s second call that night had been to Jim Post, June Hudson\u2019s husband. That background in law enforcement could come in handy. Jim was there faster than Henry. And, Jack learned that night, Jim was a former DEA agent who had actually worked in the area prior to retirement.</p><p>\u201cWe better have a little look at Calvin\u2019s camp,\u201d Jim said. \u201cIf it\u2019s just a little compound of vagrants, I don\u2019t see that as a problem. But I suspect it might be more than that. If so\u2014we\u2019ll want to tell the sheriff.\u201d</p><p>Jack was invited to spend what was left of the night with Mel at Doc\u2019s. She saw a side of him she didn\u2019t know existed. This gentle, tender giant was gripped with fury, and it was a silent and impressive fury. He held her through the night, both of them in one small hospital bed. Sleep was difficult for her and she was fitful, but every time she opened her eyes and looked at him, she found him awake, watching over her. She would look up at his face, his tense jaw and eyes narrowed in anger, but when she put her hand against his cheek, he would relax his features and turn soft eyes on her. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, baby,\u201d he said. \u201cTry to get some sleep. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid while I\u2019m with you,\u201d she whispered, and this was the truth. The next morning, early, June and Jim arrived in town. June came over to the clinic while Jim went to Jack\u2019s. \u201cI just wanted to make sure you aren\u2019t having any stressrelated problems with your pregnancy,\u201d June said. \u201cAny cramping, spotting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything seems to be fine. Except for those frequent shudders I feel when I think about what might have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going to spend a couple of hours in town,\u201d June said. \u201cIf you have patients, I\u2019ll help. Do you need to rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack was here last night. I don\u2019t think he slept, but I got a little rest. Where\u2019s the baby?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cSusan has Jamie, and John and my dad have the clinic.\u201d She smiled. \u201cWe country folk have to be flexible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Jim doing?\u201d Mel asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with Jack and Preacher. They won\u2019t be long. They\u2019re going to have to take a look at that place the man came from, Mel. Be sure there\u2019s no one else out there that will come into town and threaten a life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI think they can handle it,\u201d June said. \u201cI guess it has to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it, June. I\u2019ve been out to that camp a dozen times. I didn\u2019t see Calvin Thompson there except the very first time, when I went with Doc to help him treat some injuries. But I went, though I\u2019d been told not to. And I was a little nervous and scared, but it never once occurred to me that someone from there might hold a knife to my throat and\u2014\u201d She stopped, unable to go on.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord,\u201d June said. \u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d</p><p>Mel shrugged. Her voice was small when she answered. \u201cThey looked hungry.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile grew on June Hudson\u2019s face. \u201cAnd you thought you weren\u2019t one of us. What hooey.\u201d</p><p>Jack, Preacher and Jim piled into Jack\u2019s truck and drove back into the woods. The compound was less than twenty miles away, but traversed by so many old logging roads and concealed roads, it took almost an hour to get there. They were so buried, one would never be inclined to worry that these people would pose a dangerous threat. The young man with the knife, Calvin Thompson, hadn\u2019t been with them long. He wasn\u2019t just a vagrant, but a violent felon. It hadn\u2019t taken Henry Depardeau long to learn he had a long drug-related criminal record from other California cities and had been hiding in the forest to dodge felony warrants for his arrest. It was likely that Maxine had brought him to her father\u2019s hideaway in the forest. When they got to the camp, Jim Post said, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I figured.\u201d He pointed to the camouflaged semitrailer, a generator beside it. The three men from Virgin River got out of the truck, brandishing rifles of the caliber that would kill a black bear with one shot. Rifles that would cut a man in half. Of course there was no one in evidence.</p><p>\u201cPaulis!\u201d Jack called.</p><p>A skinny, wasted-looking, bearded man came out of a hut. A shack. Behind him was a stringy-haired, skinny young woman. Slowly a few more men came around from the back of dilapidated trailers. This small crowd didn\u2019t display arms, but they stayed back, having knowledge of the firearms Jack, Jim and Preacher carried. Jack approached Paulis. \u201cAre you growing?\u201d Jack asked.</p><p>The man shook his head.</p><p>\u201cDid Thompson bring that operation in here?\u201d</p><p>The girl made a sound and covered her mouth with her hand. Paulis gave a nod.</p><p>\u201cHe tried to kill a woman last night. For drugs and property. He\u2019s dead. Who brought in the trailer?\u201d</p><p>Paulis shook his head. \u201cWe don\u2019t exchange names around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he look like?\u201d Jim asked.</p><p>Paulis just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cCome on, man. You want to go to jail for him? What\u2019d he drive?\u201d</p><p>Paulis shrugged again, but Maxine stepped around her father, tears on her pale cheeks.</p><p>\u201cA big black Range Rover. Lights up top. You know the kind. He paid Calvin to watch the grow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who he is,\u201d Jack said quietly to Jim. \u201cDon\u2019t know where he is, but I have a good idea this isn\u2019t his only grow. And I happen to know the license number on that big SUV.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that could come in handy.\u201d</p><p>Then to Clifford Paulis, Jack said, \u201cYou have twenty-four hours to clear this camp and move out. The sheriff\u2019s deputy will be out here to close down this spot real quick, and if you\u2019re here, you\u2019ll be arrested\u2014that shit\u2019s in your possession now. You have to move on now. I don\u2019t want you around. You hear me?\u201d</p><p>Paulis just nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat woman was my woman,\u201d Jack said more quietly. \u201cI\u2019m going to look for you, and if I can find you, you haven\u2019t moved far enough, you understand me?\u201d</p><p>Paulis dipped his chin once more.</p><p>The differences in the men\u2014those from the camp and Jack, Jim and Preacher, left no doubt as to who would be the winners in any kind of conflict. Just to drive the point home, Jack raised his 30-06 caliber, bolt action rifle, aimed it at the generator beside the half-buried trailer in the compound, and fired, decimating it. The report was loud enough to shake the trees. The men in view flinched, raised their hands to cover their faces or cowered back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming back tomorrow,\u201d Jack said. \u201cEarly.\u201d</p><p>When they were back in the truck, Jack asked Jim, \u201cWhat do you make of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVagrants. Just living in the forest. They didn\u2019t have the means to put that trailer in there\u2014that was arranged by whoever Calvin was working for. They\u2019ll go, most likely. Deeper in the forest, where they can set up camp again and be left alone. We\u2019ll let Henry know where to find it. But you should make good on your advice just the same. They can\u2019t be here anymore. If they\u2019re not dangerous, they\u2019re willing to be taken advantage of by dangerous people.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see any guns. They have to be armed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure\u2014but they\u2019re not armed with much. They saw what we\u2019re carrying\u2014none of these old boys are going to be shooting at us. The ones to worry about are guys like Calvin\u2019s boss, and his boss\u2019s boss. DEA cleared out a whole town in the Trinity Alps several years ago while I was an agent\u2014and now those boys had \u2019em some guns.\u201d Jim gave Jack a shot in the arm. \u201cI\u2019m for staying out of their business. If Forestry runs across them, they\u2019ll report them to the sheriff\u2019s department or maybe to the DEA.\u201d</p> <p>The spirit of the town was tense and worried. Jack had become their favorite son, and his chosen woman\u2014the woman who had come here to help people\u2014had had a brush with death.</p><p>Throughout the day, neighbors came to Doc\u2019s bearing food and offering conversation. There were no patients, only friends. Doc got out of bed and dressed, coming downstairs to visit. With the exception of a short nap in the afternoon, he stayed up the entire day.</p><p>Jim and June only stayed a couple of hours, but Jack was a presence on and off throughout the day, which worked well because people who came by the house to check on Mel were anxious to talk to him. \u201cShot him while he held her at knife-point, they\u2019re saying.\u201d Jack merely nodded and reached for her hand. \u201cHow\u2019d you dare?</p><p>How\u2019d you know you wouldn\u2019t be off by a half inch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have that much to spare,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have pulled the trigger if I thought there was any chance I\u2019d be off my mark.\u201d</p> <p>Another matter of great interest was the shining ring that graced Mel\u2019s finger. The engagement was met with happiness and affection, though not surprise. There were many questions about the wedding, and a serious protest when it was learned that there would be a small ceremony in a few days for family only in Sacramento. Jack, Doc and Mel ate a dinner made up of the food brought by well-wishers and when it was done and the dishes cleaned up, Doc said, \u201cI\u2019m going to bed, Melinda. You should go back to your man\u2019s bed. Those hospital beds are no place for the two of you.\u201d And up the stairs he slowly trudged.</p><p>\u201cYes, you should,\u201d Jack confirmed, taking her with him across the street. Having slept so little the night before, once she was in Jack\u2019s bed, curled up against his warmth, she nearly passed out from exhaustion.</p><p>Before the sun was even up the next morning, she was awakened by the sound of amassing vehicles. She looked at the clock and saw that it was barely 5:00 a.m. She rummaged around for clothes and went through the bar onto the porch to see what all the commotion was about. There in the street were trucks, campers, AWD vehicles, SUVs, cars. Men were standing around in the street, checking their rifles, even putting on flak jackets and bulletproof vests. Some wore jeans and work shirts, some wore fatigues. She recognized faces among them\u2014Mike Valenzuela from L.A., Zeke from Fresno, Paul Haggerty and Joe Benson from Grants Pass, Oregon. There were also neighbors and ranchers and farmers from Virgin River. She saw that Ricky was with them, looking for all the world like a grown man.</p><p>She watched them for a while before Jack noticed her standing there, her hair all mussed from sleep, her feet bare. He handed his rifle off to Paul and went to her.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a girl,\u201d he said. \u201cA little pregnant girl, but I know better.\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe you could sleep awhile longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThrough this? What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScavenger hunt,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing for you to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to check, see if the woods need to be cleaned out,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWith weapons? Vests? My God, Jack.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her against him briefly and said, \u201cI doubt we\u2019ll have any trouble, Mel. But we should be prepared for whatever we run into. We\u2019re just going to cut a wide circle around the town\u2014be certain there are no drug farmers or criminals close by. No camps like the one Thompson came from. No camps for people like Thompson to hide out in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will you know whether there are dangerous people in ordinary camps? I\u2019m told there are plenty of those kind of camps scattered around. Squatters, vagrants, mountain people.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cThen we should know who\u2019s out there. Look for what\u2019s in their camps, check their weapons so we know what they have. Pot\u2019s pretty easy to spot\u2014it has a real distinctive green color and it almost always comes with camouflage and a generator.\u201d</p> <p>She put a hand on the vest he wore. \u201cAnd you need this because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m going to be a father soon, and I don\u2019t take foolish chances. One of these idiots could misfire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking Ricky with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look out for Ricky. We\u2019ll all be looking out for him, but believe me\u2014he\u2019s up to this. I taught him to shoot myself. He wouldn\u2019t be left out, because it\u2019s about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this absolutely necessary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, and looked down at her with the expression she had learned meant he was all about business.</p><p>Jim Post was beside Jack, grinning. \u201cMorning,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDoes June know you\u2019re doing this?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like, \u2018You better be careful.\u2019 The hard part was convincing old Doc Hudson he couldn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this better left to the police? The sheriff?\u201d</p><p>Jim put a foot up on the porch step. He shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ve already told Henry about Paulis\u2019s camp and gave him the description of the vehicle being driven by the man who probably had it set up. Hopefully, the Paulis camp is deserted and their plants left behind. We saw \u2019em, Mel\u2014and there\u2019s no question\u2014those old squatters didn\u2019t bring a semi in, bury it, camouflage it and set up a grow. But someone did\u2014and there could be more of those. There\u2019s real trouble way back in there\u2014on federal land. We\u2019re not going that far back. We\u2019ll stay out of their business. We\u2019ll leave that up to the professionals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just seems so vigilante-like,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNaw, we\u2019re not going to do anything illegal, Mel. We\u2019re just going to send a little message. You don\u2019t want to give our women, our towns, any reason to feel they have to fight back. Understand?\u201d She didn\u2019t answer. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything like that near enough to threaten Virgin River, we\u2019ll give them a chance to run for their lives before we disclose their location to authorities. It\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll be home by dark.\u201d</p><p>She said to Jack, \u201cI\u2019m going to be scared to death all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to stay here with you, so you won\u2019t be scared?\u201d he asked her. \u201cOr can you believe in me one more time?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip, but nodded. He slipped an arm around her waist and lifted her up to his mouth, kissing her deeply. \u201cYou taste so good in the morning,\u201d he said, smiling down at her. \u201cIs that normal?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better be careful,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember that I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need any more than that,\u201d he said, putting her back on her feet. Preacher came to the porch. He nodded at her, bushy brows drawn together in a frown that made her almost shudder. \u201cJust send him in,\u201d Mel said. \u201cThat\u2019ll scare them all away.\u201d And to her surprise, Preacher smiled so big, for a moment she didn\u2019t recognize him.</p><p>When they had finally left in a grand parade, Mel called June. \u201cDo you know what your husband is doing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d June said, sounding annoyed. \u201cNot babysitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you worried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly that one of them will shoot off a toe. Why? Are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...Yes! You should have seen them\u2014in their vests and with those big guns. I mean, big guns!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there are bear out there, you know. You don\u2019t want a peashooter,\u201d June said.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about Jack, honey. I think it\u2019s been established he\u2019s a good shot, if he needs to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJim?\u201d She laughed. \u201cMel, Jim used to do this for a living. He won\u2019t admit he misses it just a little bit. But I swear I heard him giggle.\u201d</p><p>All day long she had visions of gun battles in the forest. The unfortunate lack of work couldn\u2019t keep her from pacing. With the bar closed and so many of the men out on the scavenger hunt, the town was impossibly quiet.</p><p>Mel spent most of the day on Doc\u2019s porch, sitting on the steps. It was about noon when the black Range Rover pulled slowly into town. He drove up alongside the clinic and lowered his tinted window. \u201cI heard what happened to you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou did? I didn\u2019t know we had any mutual friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you a couple of things, because you did me a favor. Number one\u2014I know about Thompson and he\u2019s a loose cannon. I know a lot of what goes on back there and there aren\u2019t any others like him, that I know of. People like Vickie\u2014that\u2019s the woman who had the baby\u2014she\u2019s been in some trouble, but she\u2019s not dangerous to anybody. She just flies under the radar, has had some tough breaks, doesn\u2019t know a lot of ways to make money. By the way\u2014she\u2019s gone. Took that baby and went to a sister\u2019s in Arizona. I got her on a bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said Nevada before,\u201d Mel said.</p><p>\u201cDid I now?\u201d he asked, a small smile. \u201cWell, I could be mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just hope you know where to send the check, since it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, they\u2019ll have what they need. Didn\u2019t I say that?\u201d</p><p>She was silent a moment, thinking. The check he was going to send would come from the sale of marijuana. There were people who thought it was no worse than a few beers, and she was about to pledge her life and love to a man who owned a bar, thought nothing of serving up a few beers. Then there were others who recognized its medical benefits. And a third faction saw it as a dangerous drug\u2014one that, in the wrong hands, perhaps young hands, could lead to more dangerous addictions. Mel only knew two things: it was still illegal without a prescription and, because it was illegal, crime was often associated with it.</p><p>\u201cYou said you wanted to tell me a couple of things,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving the area. There\u2019s been a death. Doesn\u2019t really matter that Thompson won\u2019t be any great loss to society,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cHe\u2019s associated with a couple of the operations here, so there\u2019s going to be an investigation, warrants, arrests. I\u2019ll be moving on.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cYou get your wish. You won\u2019t be doing business with me anymore.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward on the porch steps. \u201cHave you done violence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cNot so far. We\u2019ve had our little misunderstandings. But I\u2019m just a businessman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t find a more legal business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d he answered, smiling. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t find a more profitable one.\u201d</p><p>The window went up and he moved down the street and out of sight. She memorized the license plate, knowing that if he was any good at his profession, it wouldn\u2019t matter.</p><p>At dusk, she sat out on Doc\u2019s porch and waited. As darkness began to descend, she heard the vehicles return. As they drove slowly into town and pulled up to the bar, she tried to assess the mood of the group. Everyone seemed solemn and tired as they got out of trucks and jeeps, stretching their backs and arms. Vests were gone, guns stowed in their racks and sleeves rolled up. But shortly they were clapping each other on the back, laughing and gathering around Jack\u2019s porch. She was so relieved to see Ricky, laughing with the men, one of the brothers, completely safe. The last truck to pull up was Preacher\u2019s, in which Jack rode, as well, and they had something large in the bed, something hanging out. When he parked, all the men gathered around, and the tempo of the group seemed to pick up. There was laughter and loud voices. Almost afraid to know what was going on, she walked across the street. Jack was coming for her and met her halfway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cWell? You find anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad guys,\u201d he said. \u201cPaulis\u2019s camp was busted up and what junk they left behind, we destroyed. Henry and a couple of deputies showed up to confiscate their plants. I just don\u2019t want them back in the neighborhood if they\u2019re going to let a drug operation in. Truthfully, they don\u2019t have the strength to keep them out, so we will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever thought\u2014it\u2019s only a little pot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an opinion about that,\u201d he said with a shrug. \u201cBut if it\u2019s legalized and pharmaceutical companies grow it, we won\u2019t have to be afraid for our women and children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got in the truck? What\u2019s that awful smell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bear. Wanna see?\u201d he asked, smiling.</p><p>\u201cA bear? Why on earth...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe was really pissed,\u201d Jack said. \u201cCome and see\u2014he\u2019s huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho shot him?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s taking credit or who actually shot him? Because I think everyone is taking credit.\u201d He slipped an arm around her waist and walked her the rest of the way. She began to pick up the voices. \u201cI swear, I heard Preacher scream,\u201d someone said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t scream, jag-off. That was a battle cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounded like a little girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore holes in that bear than in my head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t like that repellant so much, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never saw one go through that stuff before. They usually just rub their little punkin eyes and run back in the woods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you, Preacher screamed. Thought he was gonna cry like a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna eat, jag-off?\u201d</p><p>There was laughter all around. A carnival-like atmosphere ensued. The serious group that had left town in the morning had come back like soldiers from war, elated, victorious. Except this war turned out to be with a bear.</p><p>Mel glanced in the back of the truck and jumped back. The bear not only filled the bed, he hung out the end. The claws on his paws were terrifying. He was tied in, tied down, even though he was dead. His eyes were open but sightless and his tongue hung out of his mouth. And he stunk to high heaven.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s calling Fish and Game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, do we have to call them? You know they\u2019re gonna take the frickin\u2019 bear. That\u2019s my bear!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t your bear, jag-off. I shot the bear,\u201d Preacher insisted loudly.</p><p>\u201cYou screamed like a girl and the rest of us shot the bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho really shot the bear?\u201d Mel asked Jack.</p><p>\u201cI think Preacher shot the bear when he came at him. Then so did everybody else. And yeah, I think he screamed. I would have. That bear got so damn close.\u201d But as he said this, he grinned like a boy who had just made a touchdown. Preacher stomped over to Jack and Mel. He bent down and whispered to Mel, \u201cI did not scream.\u201d He turned and stomped off.</p><p>\u201cHoney,\u201d Jack said, softly. \u201cWe found one other thing today.\u201d She looked up at him expectantly. \u201cWe found the black Range Rover. Ran off the road and went down a couple hundred feet...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d she asked fearfully, surprised that she even cared.</p><p>\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any body.\u201d</p><p>She gave a short, startled laugh. \u201cGod,\u201d she said. \u201cHe came by here today at about noon. All he did was roll down the window and said that because I did him a favor he wanted me to know there was no one else out there in the cannabis trade like Thompson that he knew of, and he was leaving the area. Jack, he must have ditched the truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means he might be getting a new vehicle, new look and be back. Never go with him again, Mel. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>She was thinking, insanely, that he was one person who treated her okay and seemed to have something of a conscience. If he came to her and said someone needed medical help, it would be hard to refuse him. \u201cJust how many children do you think he can father?\u201d she asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cMen have lapses in judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they? Hopefully you haven\u2019t had too many,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had any,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cSo. That\u2019s all you got? A wrecked SUV and a bear? Must be a little anticlimactic for you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou calling that bear anticlimactic? Baby, that is a huge frickin\u2019 bear!\u201d</p><p>There must have been about twenty-five men, they all smelled bad, and they were filing into the bar. Mel sniffed Jack\u2019s shirt. \u201cWhew,\u201d she said. \u201cYou smell almost as bad as the bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019ll have beer, food and cigars. I have to get in there and start serving beer while Preacher and Ricky fire up the barbecue pit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help,\u201d she said, taking his hand. \u201cIt was a waste of time, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in my mind. Our forest is nice and tidy, we\u2019re turning a trailer full of plants over to the sheriff and we got a mean old bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had fun,\u201d she accused.</p><p>\u201cNot on purpose,\u201d he said. But his smile was very large.</p><p>\u201cIs it over, Jack?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cI hope so, baby. God, I hope so.\u201d</p><p>For once Mel was behind the bar. She helped serve beer and drinks, tossed a great big salad while Preacher turned steaks on the grill. Plates and utensils were put out for a buffet-style service. The men poked fun at each other, their laughter getting louder and wilder as the night wore on. Although Ricky was officially working, when he\u2019d pass one of the men, he\u2019d be pulled into a strong-armed embrace and praised as though he was a comrade. Doc wandered across the street for a whiskey, visited with the men for a while before going back to his house. Most of the locals left before the meal was served, home to claim to their wives that they shot the bear. It was about nine when the cards and cigars came out. Jack grabbed Mel\u2019s hand and said, \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here. You must be exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d she said, leaning against him. \u201cMy feelings won\u2019t be hurt if you want to hang out with your boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll probably be around a day or two. Since they came all this way, they\u2019ll want to fish and stink up my bar. Fishing\u2019s starting to get good.\u201d He put an arm around Mel and walked her through the back of the bar. \u201cWe need to give the baby a nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to give the baby\u2019s father a shower,\u201d she said, wrinkling her nose. While Jack showered, Mel put on one of his shirts, her favorite soft chambray. She curled up on the sofa with one of Jack\u2019s magazines in her lap, flipping through the pages. She would have to find something better than Field and Stream, she decided. She could hear the raucous laughter from the bar; she could almost smell the cigar smoke, but it made her smile. These were good people\u2014people who came running when they thought there was a possible danger. Jack\u2019s friends, the people in town\u2014</p><p>they knew the meaning of being neighbors.</p><p>She had only known the neighbors on each side of her in L.A. With Mark\u2019s long hours, they didn\u2019t socialize as much as she\u2019d have liked. And big cities can be less friendly. Everyone was so focused on work, on making money, on buying things. Mel used to concentrate on that, as well. Besides that Hummer, which she\u2019d needed for work and was as much for the town as herself, she\u2019d hardly bought a thing in six months. She patted her tummy\u2014she would have to buy clothes soon\u2014she couldn\u2019t get her jeans closed. As she thought about it, she didn\u2019t crave any particular label. It made her smile. Lately, she didn\u2019t recognize herself. She was not the same woman who nearly slid off the mountain six months ago.</p><p>Jack came out of the shower, a towel around his waist, rubbing dry his short hair with another one. He tossed the second towel and went to his bed, lifting the covers and inclining his head toward her. She put aside the magazine and went to him. As she slipped in, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re sure you don\u2019t want to play poker and make yourself smell disgusting? They\u2019re going to keep us up all night anyway.\u201d</p><p>He dropped his towel and got in beside her. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d He scooped her up next to him and she snuggled close.</p><p>\u201cHave I told you how much I like sleeping with you?\u201d she asked him. \u201cYou sleep very well. And you don\u2019t snore. But I think maybe you wake up too early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the mornings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fit in my pants already,\u201d she said. She lifted herself up and with her elbows resting on his chest said, \u201cYou call them and they just come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only called one of them\u2014Mike in L.A.\u2014he called the others. They\u2019re just like that. And if any of them called\u2014I\u2019d go.\u201d He smiled at her. \u201cI never expected a posse like that to turn out. Says something about the way people feel about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t actually find anyone scary out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked what I found. I wasn\u2019t willing to take any chances, and neither was anyone else. The same thing would happen for any other crisis\u2014like a bear mauling or a forest fire or someone lost in the woods. People band up, go out and take care of the problem if they can. What else are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>She played idly with his damp chest hair. \u201cThat look you get when you\u2019re facing off with someone or something, do you have any idea how dark it is? You might want to keep that look in the closet\u2014it\u2019s disturbing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to tell you something,\u201d he said. \u201cI asked your sister all about your husband. Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I understand he was a great man. A brilliant man\u2014and kind. He did a lot of good in the world, and he was good to you. I have a lot of respect for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t tell me this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to say this to you. I might muck it up, but you have to listen. A couple of weeks ago I let you cry alone, because I was pissed. I caught you talking to his picture and I got threatened. Threatened by a dead man, which makes me a true candy-ass.\u201d He touched her hair. \u201cI won\u2019t ever do that again, Mel. I understand why you love him, why you\u2019ll always\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to do this, and you\u2019re going to listen. I know you didn\u2019t want your life to change the way it did, and you couldn\u2019t control it. Just like you can\u2019t control what you feel. You don\u2019t have to pretend you don\u2019t think about him, or miss him. And if you have those moments when you\u2019re sad, when you wish you could have him back in your life, you can be honest with me. You don\u2019t have to pretend it\u2019s PMS.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cWe both know you don\u2019t have PMS anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want one thing. If I can be a sport about the fact that he\u2019ll always be an important part of your life, can you try to not be sorry that we\u2019re together, having this baby? Because I have to tell you, I\u2019ve never been more ready for anything. I\u2019ll do my best not to be jealous. I realize I\u2019m not your first choice, but your next choice. That\u2019s good enough for me, and I\u2019m sorry someone died. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, Mel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you saying this? It\u2019s such nonsense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I heard,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard you saying you were sorry you were pregnant, that it just happened, and you promised not to forget him.\u201d</p><p>Mel gave him a look of disbelief. \u201cI thought you were hurt by what you heard me say\u2014but you were hurt because of what you didn\u2019t hear!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2019m not sorry I\u2019m pregnant. I\u2019m thrilled! I got myself all worked up because I realized that I was more in love with you than I thought possible. Maybe more in love than I\u2019ve ever been in my life. I had a short insane moment of feeling that I\u2019d betrayed his memory somehow. As though I\u2019d been unfaithful or something. It\u2019s true\u2014I didn\u2019t mean for it to happen, but it did. I know I resisted, but you just got to me. I promised Mark I wouldn\u2019t forget him. And I won\u2019t because you\u2019re right, he was a good man. And I respect him, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Author: Robyn Carr</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said, playing with his thick, damp hair. \u201cI was upset and a little confused. I loved Mark very much. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d get to feel that again, much less for someone new. Imagine how it threw me when I realized I felt something even stronger. Something even more powerful. Jack, I was telling Mark I had moved on. I was saying goodbye\u2014it was difficult. I\u2019m not going to be a widow anymore, darling. I\u2019m going to be a wife. This thing I have with you\u2014it\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in this high, emotional state,\u201d she said with a shrug. \u201cI was tired and pregnant. Jack, I love you so much. Can\u2019t you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...yeah,\u201d he said, sitting up in the bed a little. \u201cBut I thought it was mostly physical. I mean\u2014damn, Mel. We\u2019re really good together. The way we come together, it almost makes me weak to think about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind the physical part one bit,\u201d she said with a mischievous grin. \u201cBut I love more about you than that. Your character, for one thing. Your generosity and how about your courage. Oh, there are about a million things, but I\u2019m done talking now.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him. \u201cNow I want you to say something wonderful to me right before you tear this shirt off my body.\u201d</p> <p>He rolled her over onto her back and, looking into her eyes, said, \u201cMel, you\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me. I\u2019m going to make you so happy, you won\u2019t be able to stand it. You\u2019re going to wake up singing every morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already do, Jack.\u201d </p>  </body></html>"]
