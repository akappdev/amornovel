Some were shopping, some talking and laughing, and some snacking while they walked. But none of them were dropping to their knees and begging the gods for more time in those feeble bodies. Nor were they sobbing because they wouldn\u2019t get it.He shifted his focus from the people to their surroundings. Muted moonlight spilled from the sky, blending with the amber glow of the street lamps and casting shadows on the paved pathways. Buildings stretched on every side, some of the higher points wrapped in light green awnings, the perfect contrast to the emerald trees rising from their bases.</p><p>Pretty, as far as coffins went.</p> <p>Humans knew they were fading. Hell, they grew up knowing they\u2019d have to abandon everything and everyone they loved, and yet, as he\u2019d already observed, they didn\u2019t demand or even request more time. And that...fascinated him. Were Aeron to learn he\u2019d soon be separated from his friends, the other demon-possessed warriors he\u2019d spent the last few thousand years protecting, he would have done anything\u2014yes, even beg\u2014to change his fate.</p><p>So why didn\u2019t the mortals? What did they know that he did not?</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t dying,\u201d his friend Paris said from beside him. \u201cThey\u2019re living while they have the chance.\u201d</p><p>Aeron snorted. That wasn\u2019t the answer he sought. For how could they live while they had the chance when their \u201cchance\u201d was a mere blink of time? \u201cThey\u2019re frail. Easily destroyed. As you well know.\u201d Cruel of him to say because Paris\u2019s...girlfriend? Lover? Chosen female? Whatever she was, she\u2019d recently been shot to death in front of Paris. Still, Aeron couldn\u2019t regret his words.</p><p>Paris was the keeper of Promiscuity, forced to bed a different human every day or he would weaken and die himself. He couldn\u2019t afford to mourn the loss of one specific lover. Especially an enemy lover, which was what his little Sienna had been.</p> <p>Aeron hated to admit it, but on some level, he was glad the woman was dead. She would have used Paris\u2019s needs against him and ultimately ruined him.</p><p>I, however, will ensure his safety always. It was a vow. The king of the gods had given Paris a choice: the return of his female\u2019s soul or Aeron\u2019s freedom from a horrific blood-craze that constantly danced thoughts of maiming and killing through his mind. Thoughts, he was ashamed to admit, he had acted upon. Over and over again.</p><p>Because of that curse, Reyes, the keeper of the demon of Pain, had almost lost his beloved Danika. In fact, Aeron had been poised to strike that final blow, blade sharpened, raised...falling toward her pretty neck. But just before contact, Paris had chosen Aeron and the craze had instantly left him, sparing Danika\u2019s life.</p><p>Part of Aeron still felt guilty about what had almost happened\u2014and about the consequences of Paris\u2019s choice. A guilt that was like acid in his bones, eating away at him. Paris now suffered while he reveled in his freedom. That didn\u2019t mean he would show Paris mercy in this matter, however. He loved his friend too much for that. More than that, Aeron owed him. And Aeron always repaid his debts.</p><p>Hence the reason they were on this roof.</p><p>Taking care of Paris, though, was not an easy task. For the past six nights Aeron had carted his friend here amid ceaseless protests. Paris had only to pick a woman, then Aeron would procure her and ensure the two were safe while they had sex. But each night the choice was made later. And later.</p> <p>Aeron had a feeling he and Paris would sit here and talk until sunrise this time.</p><p>Had the now-depressed warrior eschewed these weak mortals as Aeron did, he would not currently be wishing for something he couldn\u2019t have. He would not be desperate for it\u2014and denied it for all eternity.</p><p>Aeron sighed. \u201cParis,\u201d he began. Then stopped. How should he proceed? \u201cYour mourning must end.\u201d Good. To the point, just as he preferred. \u201cIt\u2019s weakening you.\u201d</p><p>Paris ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cAs if you\u2019re one to talk about weakness. How many times have you been Wrath\u2019s bitch? Countless. And in how many of those countless instances can you blame the gods? Only once. When that demon overtakes you, you lose all control of your actions. So don\u2019t add hypocrisy to your list of sins, okay?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t take offense. Sadly, Paris\u2019s claim was irrefutable. Sometimes Wrath would seize control of Aeron\u2019s body and fly him through town, striking at everyone within reach, hurting them and gorging on their terror. During those instances, Aeron was aware of what was happening, but unable to halt the carnage.</p><p>Not that he always wanted the carnage to halt. Some people deserved what they got.</p><p>But he did loathe losing control of his body, as if he were merely a puppet with strings. Or a monkey who danced on command. When he was reduced to such a state, he despised his demon\u2014but not as much as he despised himself. Because with the hatred, he also experienced pride. In Wrath. Wresting the reins of control from him required power, and power of any kind was to be prized.</p><p>Still. The love-hate tug-of-war disturbed him.</p> <p>\u201cYou might not have meant to, but you\u2019ve just proven my point,\u201d he said, jumping back into conversation. \u201cWeakness births destruction. No exceptions.\u201d In Paris\u2019s case, mourning was simply another word for distracted. And such distraction could prove fatal.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with me? What does that have to do with the humans down there?\u201d Paris pointed.</p><p>Big picture time. \u201cThose people. They age and deteriorate in a heartbeat of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd let me finish. If you fall in love with one of them, you might have her for the better part of a century. Maybe, if disease or an accident do not befall her. But it will be a century spent watching her wither and die. And during it all, you\u2019ll know an eternity without her awaits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch pessimism.\u201d Paris tsked\u2014hardly the reaction Aeron had expected. \u201cYou see it as a century spent losing that which you are unable to protect. I see it as a century spent enjoying a great blessing. A blessing that will aid you the rest of eternity.\u201d</p><p>Aid? Absurd. When you lost something precious, the memories of it became a tormenting reminder of what you could never have again. Those memories added to your troubles, distracting you\u2014unlike Paris, he wouldn\u2019t wrap the word in a pretty bow\u2014rather than strengthening you.</p><p>Proof: that\u2019s how he felt about Baden, keeper of Distrust and once his best friend. Long ago, he\u2019d lost the man he\u2019d loved more than he would have loved even a blood brother, and now, every time he was alone, he pictured Baden and wondered about what could have been.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want that for Paris.</p><p>Forget big picture. Time for a little more mercilessness. \u201cIf you\u2019re so capable of accepting loss, why do you still mourn Sienna?\u201d</p><p>A beam of moonlight hit Paris\u2019s face, and Aeron saw that his eyes were slightly glazed. Obviously, he\u2019d been drinking. Again. \u201cI didn\u2019t have my century with her. I had but a few days.\u201d Flat tone.</p><p>Don\u2019t stop now. \u201cAnd if you had been given a hundred years with her before she died, you would now be at peace with her death?\u201d</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought so.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Paris slammed a fist into the roof and the entire building shook. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this anymore.\u201d</p><p>Too bad. \u201cLoss is loss. Weakness is weakness. If we don\u2019t allow ourselves to grow attached to the humans, we won\u2019t care when they leave us. If we harden our hearts, we won\u2019t desire that which we cannot have. Our demons taught us that very well.\u201d</p><p>Each of their demons had once lived in hell and desired freedom, and so together they fought their way out. Only, they ended up exchanging one prison for another, and the second had been far worse than the first.</p><p>Rather than enduring sulfur and flames as they had before, they spent a thousand years trapped inside Pandora\u2019s box. A thousand years of darkness and desolation and pain. They\u2019d had no independence, no hope for something better.</p><p>Had those demons been stronger, had they not craved that which was forbidden to them, they would not have been captured.</p><p>Had Aeron been stronger of will, he would not later have helped open that box. Would not then have been cursed to house the very evil he had released inside his own body. Would not have been kicked from the heavens, the only home he\u2019d ever known, to spend the rest of eternity in this chaotic land where nothing stayed the same.</p><p>He would not have lost Baden while warring with Hunters\u2014despicable mortals who abhorred the Lords, blaming them for the world\u2019s evil. A friend just died of cancer? Of course the Lords were responsible. A teenage girl just discovered she was pregnant? The Lords had clearly struck again.</p><p>Had he been stronger, he would not be caught up in that war once again, fighting, killing. Always killing.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever yearned for a mortal?\u201d Paris asked, drawing him from his dark thoughts. \u201cSexually?\u201d</p><p>A quiet laugh escaped him. \u201cWelcome a female into my life one day, only to lose her the next? No.\u201d He was smarter than that.</p><p>\u201cWho says you have to lose her?\u201d Paris withdrew a flask from the inside of his leather jacket and took a long swig.</p><p>More alcohol already? Clearly his little pep talk hadn\u2019t done his friend a bit of good.</p><p>After swallowing, Paris added, \u201cMaddox has Ashlyn, Lucien has Anya, Reyes has Danika and now Sabin has Gwen. Even Gwen\u2019s sister, Bianka the Terrible, has a lover. An angel I had to oil-wrestle, but whatever. We won\u2019t talk about that part.\u201d</p><p>Oil-wrestling? Yes. Best to avoid. \u201cThose couples have each other, but each of those women has an ability that sets her apart from the others of her kind. They\u2019re more than human.\u201d That didn\u2019t mean they would live forever, though. Even immortals could be slain. He\u2019d been the one to pick up Baden\u2019s head\u2014without the warrior\u2019s body. He\u2019d been the one to first glimpse that eternally frozen expression of shock. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, hello, solution. Find a female with an ability that sets her apart,\u201d Paris said dryly.</p><p>As if it were that easy. Besides... \u201cI have Legion, and she\u2019s all I can handle at the moment.\u201d He pictured the little demon so like a daughter to him and grinned. When standing, she only reached his waist. She had green scales, two tiny horns that had just sprouted atop her head and sharp teeth that produced poisonous saliva. Tiaras were her favorite accessory and living flesh her favorite meal.</p><p>The first he enjoyed indulging, the second they were working on.</p> <p>Aeron had met her in hell. Well, as close to the blistering pit as a man could get without actually melting inside its flames. He\u2019d been chained next door, so to speak, drunk with that cursed bloodlust, determined to slay even his friends, when Legion had dug her way to him, her presence somehow clearing his mind, giving him the strength he so prized. She\u2019d helped him escape, and they\u2019d been together ever since.</p><p>Except for now. His precious baby girl had returned to hell, a place she despised, all because an honest-to-the-gods angel had been watching Aeron, skulking in the shadows, invisible, waiting for...something. What, he didn\u2019t know. He only knew that intense gaze wasn\u2019t on him right now, but it would return. It always did. And Legion couldn\u2019t stand it.</p><p>He leaned back and peered up at the night sky. The stars were vivid tonight, like diamonds scattered across black satin. Sometimes, when he craved even the illusion of solitude, he would soar as high as his wings would take him and then fall, fast and sure, only slowing seconds before impact.</p><p>As Paris downed another mouthful of his liquor, the scent of ambrosia wafted on the breeze, as gentle and sweet as baby\u2019s breath. Aeron shook his head. Ambrosia was his friend\u2019s drug of choice, the only thing capable of numbing mind and body for men such as them, but its use was getting out of hand, making the once fierce soldier sloppy.</p><p>With Galen, leader of the Hunters and a demon-possessed warrior like them, roaming the streets, he needed his friend lucid at the very least. Factor in the angel, and well, he needed his friend in top fighting form. Angels, as he\u2019d recently learned, were demon-assassins.</p> <p>Did this angel want to kill him? He wasn\u2019t sure, and Bianka\u2019s consort, Lysander, wouldn\u2019t tell him. But then, the answer really didn\u2019t matter. He planned to gut the coward, male or female, the moment it grew some balls and appeared in front of him.</p><p>No one separated him from Legion. Not without suffering for it. Legion could even now be hurting, mentally and physically. At the thought, Aeron\u2019s hands clenched so tightly the bones nearly fractured. The little darling\u2019s brethren enjoyed taunting her for her kindness and compassion. They also enjoyed chasing her, and gods knew what they\u2019d do to her if they actually caught her.</p><p>\u201cMuch as you love Legion,\u201d Paris began, once again dragging Aeron from the sharply tangled mire of his thoughts. He tossed a stone at the building across from them before draining the rest of the flask. \u201cShe can\u2019t meet all your needs.\u201d</p><p>Meaning sex. Could they not abandon this topic once and for all? Aeron sighed. He hadn\u2019t bedded a woman in years, perhaps centuries. They simply weren\u2019t worth the effort. Because of Wrath, his desire to hurt them soon outweighed his desire to please them. More, as tattooed and battle-hardened as Aeron was, he had to work for every scrap of affection he received. Females were scared of him\u2014and rightly so. Softening them required time and patience he didn\u2019t have. After all, there were a thousand other, more important things he could be doing. Things like training, guarding his home, guarding his friends. Indulging Legion\u2019s every whim.</p><p>\u201cI have no such needs.\u201d And for the most part, that was true. Disciplined as he was, he rarely indulged in pleasures of the flesh. Only time he did so was while alone. \u201cI have everything I desire. Now, did we come here to share our feelings or find you a lover?\u201d</p><p>With a growl, Paris tossed the empty flask as he\u2019d tossed the stone. It slammed into the building\u2019s wall, plumes of dust and rock filling the air. \u201cOne day, someone\u2019s going to fascinate you, draw and ensnare you, and you\u2019ll crave her with every cell in your body. I hope she drives you insane. I hope, for a little while at least, she denies you, leading you on a merry chase. Perhaps then you\u2019ll understand a glimmer of my pain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what\u2019s necessary to repay the favor you did me, then I\u2019ll gladly endure such a fate. I\u2019ll even beseech the gods for it.\u201d Aeron couldn\u2019t imagine ever wanting a female, immortal or human, so much that it disrupted his life. He wasn\u2019t like the other warriors, who constantly sought companionship. He truly was happiest when he was alone. Or rather, alone with Legion. Besides, he was too proud to chase after someone who didn\u2019t return his ardor.</p><p>But he\u2019d meant what he said. For Paris, he\u2019d endure anything. \u201cDid you hear that, Cronus?\u201d he shouted to the heavens. \u201cSend me a female. One who will torment me. One who will deny me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCocky bastard.\u201d Paris chuckled. \u201cWhat if he actually sends you this unattainable female?\u201d</p><p>Gods, that amusement pleased him. It was so like the old Paris. \u201cDoubtful.\u201d Cronus wanted the warriors focused on defeating Galen. Which had been his obsession ever since Danika had predicted the god king would die by Galen\u2019s hand.</p><p>As the All-Seeing Eye, Danika\u2019s predictions were always accurate. Even the bad ones. But there was a silver lining: those visions could be used to elicit change. At least in theory.</p><p>\u201cBut what if?\u201d Paris prompted when his silence dragged on too long.</p><p>\u201cIf Cronus answers my plea, I\u2019ll enjoy the ride,\u201d Aeron lied with a grin. \u201cNow, enough about me. Let\u2019s do what we came here to do.\u201d He sat up and peered down at the street, scanning the thinning crowd.</p><p>To preserve the roads, cars weren\u2019t allowed in this part of town, so everyone had to hoof it. That\u2019s why he\u2019d picked this location. Pulling a female out of a moving vehicle wasn\u2019t something he enjoyed. This way, Paris had only to make his selection and Aeron would spread his wings and fly the warrior down. One glance at the gorgeous blue-eyed devil, and the chosen female would stop and gasp. Sometimes a smile was all that was needed to convince her to strip, right there in public, where anyone lurking in the alleyways could watch.</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t find anyone,\u201d Paris said. \u201cI\u2019ve already looked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about...her?\u201d He pointed to a plump, scantily dressed blonde.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d No hesitation. \u201cToo...obvious.\u201d</p><p>Here we go again, he thought with dread, but gestured to another woman. \u201cAnd her?\u201d This one was tall and perfectly curved with a short cap of red hair. And she was dressed conservatively.</p><p>\u201cNo. Too mannish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I don\u2019t want her. Next.\u201d</p><p>For the ensuing hour, Aeron pointed out potential bedmates and Paris shot them down for various\u2014ridiculous\u2014reasons. Too pristine, too rumpled, too tan, too pale. The only rejection that mattered was \u201cI\u2019ve had her before\u201d and as many as Paris had had, Aeron heard that one a lot.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to settle on one eventually. Why not save us both the hassle, close your eyes and point. Whoever you\u2019re pointing at will be our winner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve played that game once before. Ended up\u2014\u201d Paris shuddered. \u201cNever mind. It\u2019s not good to wander down that particular memory trail. So no. Just no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about\u2014\u201d His words halted abruptly as the woman he\u2019d been eyeballing disappeared in the shadows. She hadn\u2019t faded from view, as was natural. Normal. She had simply ceased to exist, there one moment, gone the next, the shadows somehow tugged to her as if they\u2019d been jerked on a leash.</p><p>Aeron jumped to his feet, wings automatically pushing from the slits in his bare back and expanding. \u201cWe have a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Paris, too, sprang to his feet. Even though he wavered slightly from the ambrosia, he was still a soldier and palmed a dagger.</p><p>\u201cThe dark-haired female. Did you see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>That answered Aeron\u2019s question. No, Paris hadn\u2019t seen her. If he had, the warrior wouldn\u2019t have needed to ask of whom Aeron spoke.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Aeron snaked his arms around his friend\u2019s waist and leapt from the building. Wind blasted through Paris\u2019s multicolored locks, whipping several strands against his face as the ground loomed closer...closer still... \u201cBe on the lookout for a woman with shoulder-length black hair, straight as a pin, roughly five-ten, early twenties, black clothing. Most likely she\u2019s more than human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCapture. I have questions for her.\u201d Like how she\u2019d disappeared like that. Like why she was here. Like who she worked for.</p><p>Immortals always had an agenda.</p><p>Just before they hit concrete and stone, Aeron flapped his wings. He slowed just enough to land upright with only a mild jarring. He released his charge, and they instantly branched in separate directions. After thousands of years of fighting together, they knew how to proceed without first outlining every move.</p><p>As Aeron sprinted down the alleyway to his left, the direction the woman had been heading, he folded his wings back under their slits. He spotted several people\u2014a couple holding hands, a homeless male draining a bottle of whiskey, a man walking his dog\u2014but no dark-haired female. He reached a brick wall and spun. Damn this. Was she like Lucien? Able to whisk herself to any location with only a thought?</p><p>Scowling, he kicked back into motion. He\u2019d search every alley in the area if need be. Only, halfway down, the shadows around him thickened, consuming him, choking out the golden glow of the street lamps. Thousands of muted screams seemed to seep from the gloom. Tortured screams. Agonized screams.</p><p>He stopped, lest he slam into something\u2014or someone\u2014and palmed two blades. What the hell was\u2014</p><p>A woman\u2014the woman\u2014stepped from the shadows, only a few feet away from him. She was the only light in that sudden, vast expanse of dark. Her eyes were as black as the gloom around her, her lips as red and moist as blood. She was pretty, in a feral kind of way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wrath hissed inside his head.</p><p>For a moment, Aeron feared Cronus had actually listened to him after all and sent a female to torment him. But as he stared over at her, there was no heat in his veins, no flutter in his heartbeat, as he\u2019d heard the other Lords expound on whenever one found a female he just \u201chad to have.\u201d She was like any other to him: easily forgettable.</p><p>\u201cWell, well, well. Aren\u2019t I a lucky girl. You\u2019re one of them, a Lord of the Underworld, and you came to me,\u201d she said, her voice as raspy as smoke. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have to ask.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am a Lord, yes.\u201d There was no reason to deny it. The townspeople recognized him and the others on sight. Some even thought they were angels. Hunters recognized them on sight, as well, but were all too quick to renounce them as demons. Either way, the information could hardly be used against him. \u201cAnd I did come looking for you.\u201d</p><p>At his easy confirmation, her features revealed a hint of surprise. \u201cA great honor, to be sure. Why were you looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know who are you.\u201d Better question\u2014what was she?</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m not as lucky as I thought.\u201d Those lush red lips dipped into a pout and she pretended to wipe away a tear. \u201cIf my own brother doesn\u2019t recognize me.\u201d</p><p>Well, he now had part of his answer: she was a liar. \u201cI don\u2019t have a sister.\u201d</p> <p>She arched a black brow. \u201cYou sure about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He hadn\u2019t been born to a mother and father; Zeus, King of the Greek gods, had simply spoken him into existence. Same with all the Lords.</p><p>\u201cStubborn.\u201d She tsked, reminding him of Paris. \u201cI should\u2019ve known we\u2019d be just alike. Anyway, it\u2019s so nice to finally catch one of you alone. Who\u2019d I get? Fury? Narcissism? I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I? Admit it, you\u2019re Narcissism. That\u2019s why you plastered your body with tattoos of your own face. Nice. Can I call you Narci?\u201d</p><p>Fury? Narcissism? None of his brothers carried those demons. Doubt, Disease, Misery and many others, yes, but not those. He shook his head\u2014only to remember that other demon-possessed immortals were out there. Immortals he\u2019d never met. Immortals he was supposed to find.</p><p>As he and his friends had been the ones to open Pandora\u2019s box, they\u2019d always assumed they were the only ones cursed to house its evil. But Cronus had recently corrected that false assumption, gifting the Lords with scrolls bearing the names of others like them. Apparently, there had been more demons than warriors, and with the box nowhere to be found, the Greeks\u2014the gods in power at the time\u2014had placed the remaining demons inside the immortal prisoners of Tartarus.</p><p>A discovery that did not bode well for the Lords. As Zeus\u2019s former elite sentries, they\u2019d locked many of those prisoners away\u2014and criminals often lived only for vengeance. Something Wrath had taught him well.</p> <p>\u201cHello,\u201d the woman prompted. \u201cAnyone home?\u201d</p><p>He blinked down at her, cursing himself. He\u2019d allowed himself to be distracted in the presence of a possible enemy. Fool. \u201cWho I am is none of your concern.\u201d That was information that could be used against him. Especially since lately, Wrath was so easily provoked the most innocent of statements could send it\u2014and therefore Aeron\u2014into that murderous craze, placing this town and all of its citizens in danger.</p><p>He blamed the angel stalking him.</p><p>Except he couldn\u2019t blame the angel when Wrath began snarling inside his mind, clawing at his skull, desperate to act. To hurt. The demon\u2019s keenest ability was, and had always been, sensing the sins of anyone nearby. And this woman\u2019s, he suddenly realized, were vast.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your sudden black expression as a no. You\u2019re not Narci, and no one\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop...talking...\u201d He gripped his temples, cool blades pressed against his skin, trying to stop the mental bombardment he knew was coming, another distraction he could ill afford. Useless. Her multitude of sins played through his head at once, like movies on split screens. She had recently tortured a man, had chained him to a chair and set him on fire. Before that, she had gutted a female. She had tricked, and she had stolen. Had abducted a child from his home. Had lured a male to her bed and sliced his throat. Violence...so much violence...so much terror and pain and darkness. He could hear the screams of her victims, could smell burnt flesh and taste blood.</p><p>Perhaps she\u2019d had good reason for doing those things. Perhaps not. Either way, Wrath wanted to punish her, using her own crimes against her. First it would chain her, then gut her, then slice her throat and set her on fire.</p><p>That was the way of Aeron\u2019s demon. It beat beaters, murdered murderers, as well as everything in between. So yes, at Wrath\u2019s urging, Aeron had done those things. Many times. Now, he clenched every muscle in his body, locking his bones in place. Steady. Can\u2019t lose control. Have to stay sane. But gods, the need to castigate...so strong...a need he liked more than he should have. As usual.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you here in Budapest, woman?\u201d Good. That was good. Slowly he lowered his arms.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she said, ignoring his question. \u201cThat was quite a display of restraint.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d known his demon wanted to hurt her?</p><p>\u201cSo let me guess.\u201d She tapped a nail against her chin. \u201cYou\u2019re not Narci, so you have to be...Chauvinist. Right again, aren\u2019t I? You think a pretty little thing like me can\u2019t handle the truth. Mistake. But no matter. Keep your secrets. You\u2019ll learn, though. Oh, yes, you\u2019ll learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening me, female?\u201d</p><p>Again she ignored him. \u201cWord on the street is Cronus gave you the scrolls and you plan to use them to hunt us down. To use us. Perhaps even slay us.\u201d</p><p>Aeron\u2019s stomach bottomed out. One, she knew about the scrolls when he and his friends had only just learned of them. Two, she knew she was on that list. Which meant this woman was indeed an immortal\u2014and a criminal\u2014and if she was to be believed, she was also demon-possessed.</p><p>Aeron didn\u2019t recognize her, which meant he and his friends hadn\u2019t been the ones to imprison her. That meant she\u2019d come before their time in the heavens. And that meant she was a Titan and a greater threat, for the Titans were far more savage than their Greek counterparts.</p><p>Worse, the now-freed Titans were currently in charge. She might have godly help.</p><p>\u201cWhich demon do you carry?\u201d he demanded, not above using its weaknesses against her.</p><p>She offered a wicked grin, his hard tone clearly amusing her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t share that information with me. Why should I share anything with you?\u201d</p><p>Infuriating woman. \u201cYou said us.\u201d He looked over her shoulder, half expecting someone to leap forward and attack him. All he saw was darkness...and all he heard were more of those muted screams. \u201cWhere are these others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know.\u201d She splayed her arms, her hands out and empty, as if she didn\u2019t think he warranted the use of a weapon. \u201cI\u2019m on my own, just like always, and that\u2019s the way I like it.\u201d</p><p>Probably another lie. What woman would approach a fearsome Lord of the Underworld without backup? He didn\u2019t relax his guard as he met her gaze. \u201cIf you\u2019re here to war with us, know that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWar?\u201d She laughed. \u201cWhen I could kill you all while you sleep? No, I\u2019m just here to deliver a warning. Call off the dogs or I\u2019ll wipe your presence from this world. And if anyone can do so, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>After the things he\u2019d seen in his mind, he believed her. She attacked in gloom, a phantom who delivered no warning. Without a doubt, there was no crime she found too vile. That didn\u2019t mean he was going to heed her demands. \u201cYou might think yourself powerful, but you can\u2019t defeat us all. War is what you\u2019ll get if you continue to issue such warnings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, warrior. I said what I wanted to say. You just better pray this is the last time you see me.\u201d The shadows thickened again, enveloping her and leaving absolutely no sign of her presence. Until, right next to his ear, he heard, \u201cOh, and one last thing. This was my courtesy call. Next time, I won\u2019t play nice.\u201d</p><p>Then the world around him crashed back into focus: the buildings at his sides, the trash bags littering the concrete, the inebriated male now passed out cold. Finally, Wrath calmed.</p><p>Aeron remained on alert, eyes scanning, body ready. He listened, heard only the deliberate drags of his own breath, the patter of human footsteps beyond the alley and the song of night birds.</p><p>Once more his wings expanded and he shot into the air, determined to find Paris and return to their fortress. The other Lords had to be notified. Whoever the bloodthirsty female was, whatever else she could do, she needed to be dealt with. Soon.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>\u201cAERON! AERON!\u201d</p><p>At the fortress, Aeron\u2019s booted feet hit the balcony that led into his bedroom. Jolted by the unfamiliar female voice, he released Paris.\u201cAeron!\u201d</p><p>At that third ear-piercing feminine cry of terror and desperation, both he and Paris spun to face the hill below them. Thick trees knifed toward the sky, obscuring visibility, but there, amid the dappled greens and browns, he could just make out a figure draped in white.</p><p>A figure rushing toward their home.</p><p>\u201cShadow Girl?\u201d Paris asked. \u201cHow the hell did she make it past our gate so quickly? And on foot, no less?\u201d</p><p>Aeron had explained what happened with the woman from the alley along the way. \u201cThat\u2019s not her.\u201d This voice was higher, richer and far less confident. \u201cThe gate... I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Weeks ago, after he and Paris had recovered from battle wounds inflicted by Hunters, they had erected an iron gate around the fortress. That gate stretched fifteen feet tall, was wrapped with barbed wire and had tips sharp enough to cut glass. It also vibrated with enough electricity to send a human into cardiac arrest. Anyone who attempted to climb it wouldn\u2019t live long enough to reach the other side.</p><p>\u201cThink she\u2019s Bait?\u201d Paris tilted his head, his study of her intensifying. \u201cShe could have been dropped from a heli, I guess.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hunters had been known to use beautiful human females to lure the Lords out into the open, distract them and capture them for torture. This one certainly seemed to meet the criteria, possessing long wavy hair the color of chocolate, skin as pale as a cloud and a curved, ethereal body. Aeron couldn\u2019t make out her facial features just yet, but he would bet they were exquisite.</p><p>His wings unfolded from their slits as he answered, \u201cMaybe.\u201d Damn Hunters and their perfect timing. Half his friends were gone. They\u2019d traveled to Rome to search the Temple of the Unspoken Ones, ruins that had recently risen from the sea. They hoped to find anything that would lead them to missing godly artifacts. Four artifacts that, when used together, would then lead to the location of Pandora\u2019s box.</p><p>Hunters hoped to use that box to lock the demons back inside, destroying the Lords since man could no longer live without demon. The Lords simply hoped to demolish it.</p> <p>\u201cThere are trip wires out there.\u201d The more Paris spoke, the more Aeron noticed a tremor in his tone. Because of Shadow Girl, as Paris had called her, there hadn\u2019t been time for him to bed anyone in town, so his strength must be draining. \u201cIf she\u2019s not careful... Even if she is Bait, she doesn\u2019t deserve to die like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAeron!\u201d</p><p>Paris fisted the balcony railing and leaned down for a better look. \u201cWhy\u2019s she calling for you?\u201d</p><p>And why was she using his name with such familiarity? \u201cIf she\u2019s Bait, Hunters are probably out there right now, lying in wait for me. I\u2019ll try and help her and they\u2019ll attack.\u201d</p><p>Paris straightened, face suddenly bathed in moon-light. Bruises had formed under his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll get the others, and we\u2019ll take care of her. Of them.\u201d He was off before Aeron could reply, striding out of the bedroom, boots thumping against the stone floor.</p> <p>Aeron kept his focus on the girl. As she continued to race upward, closer and closer to him, he realized the white cloth draping her was actually a robe. And the back of it, which he hadn\u2019t been able to see before, was bright red.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t wearing shoes, and when her bare toe slammed into a rock, she fell, that mass of chocolate hair cascading around her face. There were flowers woven through the curls, some of the petals missing. There were also twigs, but he didn\u2019t think she\u2019d placed those there intentionally. Her hands were shaking as she reached up and pushed the strands away.</p><p>Finally, her features came into view and every muscle in his body jumped, tensed. She was exquisite, just as he\u2019d supposed. Even splotchy and swollen from tears as she was. She had huge sky-blue eyes, a perfectly sloped nose, perfectly sculpted cheeks and jaw, both just a little rounded, and perfect lips that formed a lush heart.</p><p>He\u2019d never met her before, he would have remembered, but suddenly there was something almost...familiar about her.</p><p>She lumbered to a stand, grimacing and groaning, then started forward. Once again, she fell. A pained sob escaped her, but still she persisted, rising, edging toward the fortress. Bait or not, such determination was admirable.</p><p>Somehow she managed to dodge all the traps, weaving around them as if she knew where they were, but when she hit another rock and tumbled to the ground for a third time, she stayed down, shuddering, crying.</p> <p>His eyes widened as he studied her back. The red...Was that...blood? Fresh, still wet? The metallic tang of it drifted on the breeze and reached Aeron\u2019s nostrils, confirming his suspicions. Oh, yes. It was.</p><p>Hers? Or someone else\u2019s?</p><p>\u201cAeron.\u201d No longer a scream, but a pathetic wail. \u201cHelp me.\u201d</p><p>His wings expanded before he could think things through. Yes, Hunters would purposely injure Bait before sending her into the lions\u2019 den, hoping to gain sympathy from the target. Yes, he\u2019d probably end up with arrows and bullets in his back\u2014again\u2014but he wasn\u2019t going to leave her out there, injured and vulnerable. Wasn\u2019t going to allow his friends to risk their lives to save\u2014or destroy\u2014his little visitor.</p><p>Why me? he wondered as he shot from the balcony. Up, up he soared before falling toward her. He zigzagged to make himself less of a mark, but no arrows whizzed by and no gunshots sounded. Still, rather than land beside her, he increased his speed, reached out his arms and scooped her up without ever slowing his pace.</p><p>Perhaps she was afraid of heights and that was the reason for her sudden stiffening. Perhaps she\u2019d expected him to be killed before ever reaching her and, when he\u2019d actually managed to latch onto her, had stiffened from terror. Either way, he didn\u2019t care. He\u2019d done what he\u2019d set out to do. He had her.</p><p>She began flailing weakly against his hold, grunting in shock and pain. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me! Let me go! Let me go, or I swear to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe still, or by the gods, I will drop you.\u201d He had her by the stomach, her face aimed toward the ground. That way, she could see just how far she would fall.</p> <p>\u201cAeron?\u201d She craned her neck to see him. The moment their gazes connected, she relaxed. Even smiled slowly. \u201cAeron,\u201d she repeated on a sigh of pleasure. \u201cI was afraid you wouldn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>That pleasure, undiluted and untouched by malice, surprised\u2014and confused\u2014him. Women never looked at him like that. \u201cYour fear was misplaced. You should have feared I would come.\u201d</p><p>Her smile faded.</p><p>Better. The only thing that disturbed him now was the radio silence from his demon. As with Shadow Girl, images and urges should have bombarded him by now. Worry about it later.</p><p>Continuing to zigzag, he flew into his bedroom, not stopping on the balcony as usual. He needed cover as quickly as possible. Just in case. Except, just as he was retracting his wings, they slammed into both sides of the doorway and fire rushed from the tips to the arches.</p><p>Aeron ignored the pain as he skidded to his feet. When he righted himself, he strode to the bed and gently laid his charge atop the mattress, facedown. He ran a fingertip along the ridge of her spine and her heart-shaped lips parted on an agonized groan. He\u2019d hoped she\u2019d been doused with someone else\u2019s blood, but no. Her injuries were real.</p><p>The knowledge wouldn\u2019t soften him. She\u2019d probably inflicted the damage herself\u2014or allowed the Hunters to do it\u2014just for the sympathy it would evoke. No sympathy from me. Only irritation. As he stomped to his closet, he drew his wings into his back, but broken as they now were, they wouldn\u2019t fit under their flaps. That only increased his irritation with her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have rope and didn\u2019t want to leave the room to find some, so he grabbed two of the neckties Ashlyn had given him in case he ever wanted to \u201cdress up.\u201d He returned to the bed.</p><p>Her cheek pressed into the mattress, her gaze tracking his every move, as if she couldn\u2019t help but peer at him\u2014and not in revulsion as most females did. She watched him with something akin to desire.</p><p>An act, surely.</p><p>And yet, that desire...there was something familiar about it. Something unsettling. That\u2019s what he\u2019d noticed earlier, he thought. When she\u2019d called his name, that same desire had been evident and deep down, he\u2019d known he\u2019d encountered it before. When? Where?</p><p>From her?</p><p>He continued to stare down at her, and Wrath\u2014was still silent, he realized. This was (supposedly) the first time he\u2019d ever been in her presence, yet his demon still wasn\u2019t flashing her sins through his mind. That was odd. Had happened only once before. With Legion. Why, he\u2019d never figured out. Gods knew his baby girl had sinned.</p><p>So why was it happening again? With possible Bait, no less?</p><p>This woman, had she never sinned? Had she never said an unkind word to another? Never purposely tripped someone or stolen something as simple as a piece of candy? Those pure, sky eyes said no. Or, like Legion, had she sinned but for whatever reason, flew under Wrath\u2019s radar?</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d His fingers wrapped around one of her fragile wrists\u2014mmm, warm, smooth skin\u2014and anchored it to a bedpost with the tie. He repeated the action with her other wrist.</p><p>Not once did she protest. It was as if she\u2019d expected\u2014and already accepted\u2014that she would receive such treatment. \u201cMy name is Olivia.\u201d</p><p>Olivia. A pretty name. Fitting. Delicate. Actually, the only thing that wasn\u2019t delicate about her was her voice. Layer after layer of...what was that? The only word he could think to describe it was honesty, and so much drifted from her, he was knocked backward.</p><p>That voice had never told a lie, he would bet. It couldn\u2019t have.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here...I\u2019m here for you.\u201d</p><p>Again, that truth...it was a force that flowed into his ears, through his body, and sent him staggering. There wasn\u2019t room for doubts. Not a single one. He was simply compelled to believe her.</p><p>Sabin, keeper of Doubt, would have loved her. Nothing pleased the warrior\u2019s demon more than tearing down another\u2019s confidence.</p><p>\u201cAre you Bait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Again, he believed her; he had no choice. \u201cAre you here to kill me?\u201d He straightened and crossed his arms over his chest, glaring down at her, waiting.</p><p>He knew how fierce he looked, but again, she didn\u2019t react as females usually did: trembling, cowering, crying. She fluttered her long, black lashes at him, seemingly hurt that he\u2019d maligned her character.</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d She paused. \u201cWell, not anymore.\u201d</p><p>Not anymore? \u201cSo. At one time, you meant to slay me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was once sent to do so, yes.\u201d</p><p>Such honesty... \u201cBy whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt first, I was sent by the One True Deity to merely watch you. I didn\u2019t mean to scare your little friend away. I was only trying to do my job.\u201d Fresh tears filled her eyes, turning those beautiful blue irises into pools of remorse.</p><p>No softening. \u201cWho is the One True Deity?\u201d</p><p>Pure love lit her expression, momentarily chasing away that sheen of pain. \u201cDeity of you, Deity of me. Far more powerful than your gods, though mostly content to remain in the shadows, and so rarely acknowledged. Father to humans. Father to...angels. Like me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Angels. Like me. As the words echoed in his head, Aeron\u2019s eyes widened. No wonder his demon couldn\u2019t sense any wickedness in her. No wonder her gaze felt familiar to him. She was an angel. The angel, actually. The one sent to kill him, by her own admission. Though she didn\u2019t plan to end him \u201canymore.\u201d Why?</p><p>And did it matter? This delicate creature had been, at one point, his appointed executioner.</p><p>Suddenly he wanted to laugh. As if she could have overpowered him.</p> <p>You couldn\u2019t see her. Would you truly have been able to stop her, had she gone for your head?</p><p>The thought hit him and he lost his amusement. She was the one who had been watching him these many weeks. She was the one who had followed him, unseen, driving a pained Legion away.</p><p>Which begged the question of why Wrath wasn\u2019t reacting as Legion always did. With fear and even physical agony. Perhaps the angel controlled which demons sensed her, he considered. That would certainly be a handy ability to possess, keeping her intended victims ignorant of her presence\u2014and intentions.</p><p>He waited for brutal rage to fill him. Rage he\u2019d promised to unleash on this creature time and time again should she ever reveal herself. When the rage failed to appear, he waited for resolve. He must protect his friends at any cost.</p><p>But that, too, remained hopelessly out of reach. What he got instead? Confusion.</p> <p>\u201cYou are...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe angel who has been watching you, yes,\u201d she said, confirming his suspicions. \u201cOr rather, I was an angel.\u201d Her eyelids sealed shut, tears catching in her lashes. Her chin trembled. \u201cNow I\u2019m nothing.\u201d</p><p>Though he believed her\u2014how could he not? That voice... Seriously, he wanted to doubt her about something, anything, but couldn\u2019t manage it\u2014Aeron extended a shaky hand. What are you, a child? Man up.</p><p>Scowling at his display of weakness, he steadied his hand and flipped away her hair, careful not to touch her injured skin. He pinched the scooped neck of her robe and gently tugged. The soft material ripped easily, revealing the expanse of her back.</p><p>Once again, his eyes widened. Between her shoulder blades, where wings should have protruded, were two long grooves of broken skin, tendons torn to the spine, ripped muscle and even a peek at bone. They were savage wounds, violent and unmerciful, blood still seeping from them. He\u2019d had his own wings forcibly removed once, and it had been the most painful injury of his very long life.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d The hoarseness of his voice threw him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve fallen,\u201d she rasped, shame dripping from her tone. She buried her face in the pillow. \u201cI\u2019m angel no more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Never having encountered an angel before\u2014well, besides Lysander, but that bastard didn\u2019t count because he refused to speak to the Lords about anything of importance\u2014Aeron didn\u2019t know much about them. He only knew what Legion had told him, and of course, there was a very good chance her recounting had been colored by her hatred of them. Nothing she\u2019d described fit with the female on his bed.</p><p>Angels, Legion had said, were emotionless, soulless creatures with only one purpose: the destruction of their darker counterpart, the demons. She\u2019d also claimed that, every so often, an angel would succumb to the lures of the flesh, intrigued by the very beings he\u2014or she\u2014was supposed to loathe. That angel would then be kicked straight into hell, where the demons she had once defeated were finally allowed a little vengeance.</p><p>Was that what had happened to this one? Aeron wondered. A trip to hell, where demons had tormented her? Possible.</p><p>Should he untie her? Her eyes...so guileless, so innocent. Now they said help me. And save me.</p><p>But most of all, they said hold me and never let go.</p><p>He\u2019d been tricked by such innocence before, he thought, stopping himself before he could act. Baden had been tricked, as well, and had died for it.</p><p>A smart man would learn a little more about this woman first, he decided.</p> <p>\u201cWho took your wings?\u201d The question emerged as a gruff bark, and he nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>She gulped, shuddered. \u201cOnce I was cast\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAeron, you stupid shit,\u201d a male voice said, hushing her. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Paris stalked into his bedroom, but ground to a halt when he spotted Olivia. His eyes narrowed, and he ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cSo. It\u2019s true. You really flew out there and grabbed her.\u201d</p><p>Olivia stiffened, keeping her face hidden from view. Her shoulders began shaking as if she were sobbing. Was she finally scared? Now?</p><p>Why? Women adored Paris.</p><p>Concentrate. Aeron didn\u2019t have to ask how Paris knew what he\u2019d done. Torin, keeper of the demon of Disease, monitored the fortress and the hill it sat upon twenty-eight hours a day, nine days a week (or so it seemed). \u201cI thought you were gathering the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorin texted me, and I went to him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did he tell you about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHallway,\u201d his friend said, motioning to the door with a tilt of his chin.</p><p>Aeron shook his head. \u201cWe can discuss her here. She\u2019s not Bait.\u201d</p><p>Another swipe of his tongue over his straight, white teeth. \u201cAnd I thought I was stupid when it came to females. How do you know what she is? Did she tell you and you couldn\u2019t help but believe her?\u201d His tone was sneering.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s an angel, despot. The one who\u2019s been watching me.\u201d</p><p>That wiped the scorn from Paris\u2019s expression. \u201cAn actual angel? From heaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Lysander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Very slowly, Paris looked her over. Female connoisseur that he was\u2014or used to be\u2014he probably knew everything about her body by the time he was done. The size of her breasts, the flare of her hips, the exact length of her legs. That did not annoy Aeron. She meant nothing to him. Nothing but trouble.</p><p>\u201cWhatever she is,\u201d Paris said, far less angry than he\u2019d been, \u201cit doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not working with our enemy. Need I remind you that Galen, the world\u2019s biggest blowhard, says he\u2019s an angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he\u2019s lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she can\u2019t be?\u201d</p><p>Aeron scrubbed a hand down his suddenly tired face. \u201cOlivia. Are you working with Galen to harm us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she mumbled, and Paris stumbled backward, just as Aeron had done, clutching his chest.</p><p>\u201cMy gods,\u201d his friend gasped. \u201cThat voice...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not Bait, and she\u2019s not helping Galen.\u201d A statement of fact from Paris now.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Aeron repeated.</p><p>Paris shook his head as if to clear his thoughts. \u201cStill. Lucien will want to search the hill for Hunters. Just in case.\u201d</p><p>One of the many reasons Aeron had always followed Lucien. The warrior was smart and cautious. \u201cWhen he finishes, call a meeting with whoever\u2019s here and tell them about the other woman. The one from the alley.\u201d</p><p>Paris nodded and suddenly there was a sparkle in his blue eyes. \u201cQuite an evening you\u2019ve had so far, huh? I wonder who else you\u2019ll meet tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods help me if there\u2019s another,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have challenged Cronus, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Aeron\u2019s stomach clenched as his gaze swung back to the angel. Had the god king actually answered his dare? Was Olivia to be the one who led him for a merry chase? His heart was pounding, he realized, and his blood was heating.</p><p>He ground his teeth. Didn\u2019t matter whether she was or not. She could try to tempt him, but even she, with her fall of chocolate hair, baby blues and heart-shaped lips, would fail to do so.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t regret my words.\u201d Truth or lie, he didn\u2019t know. He hadn\u2019t thought Cronus had any power over the angels. So how then would the god king have sent her here? Or was he not responsible? Perhaps Aeron was mistaken and Cronus had nothing to do with this.</p><p>Again, it didn\u2019t matter. Not only would the angel fail to tempt him, he would ensure she left before she had time to cause a single moment of concern.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know,\u201d Paris said, \u201cTorin saw this one on the hill with his hidden cameras. Said she dug her way out of the ground.\u201d</p><p>Out of the ground. Did that mean she had been tossed into hell, and had then been forced to claw her way free? He couldn\u2019t picture the fragile-looking female doing such a thing\u2014and surviving, that is. But then he recalled the determination she\u2019d displayed while running toward the fortress. Maybe.</p><p>\u201cIs that true?\u201d He looked her over with new eyes. Sure enough, there was dirt under her fingernails and smeared on her arms. Besides the blood, however, her robe was perfectly clean.</p><p>In fact, as he watched, the tear he\u2019d made wove itself back together, much like his body did when wounded. A piece of cloth with healing properties. Would wonders never cease?</p><p>\u201cOlivia. You will answer.\u201d</p><p>She nodded without glancing up. He heard a sniff, sniff. Yes, she was sobbing.</p><p>An ache bloomed in his chest, but he ignored it. Doesn\u2019t matter what she is or what she\u2019s endured. You will not soften, damn it. She frightens and hurts Legion and has to go.</p><p>\u201cA real, live angel,\u201d Paris said, clearly awed. \u201cI\u2019ll take her to my room, if you\u2019d like, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too injured for bedsport,\u201d Aeron snapped.</p><p>Paris eyed him strangely for a moment, then grinned and shook his head. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sizing her up or anything, so let go of your jealousy.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t even deserve a response. He\u2019d never experienced jealousy, and wasn\u2019t about to start now. \u201cSo why were you offering to take her to your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I can bandage her wounds. Who\u2019s the despot now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her.\u201d Maybe. Could angels tolerate human medicine? Or would it hurt them? He knew well the dangers of giving one race something meant for another. Ashlyn had almost died when she\u2019d drunk wine meant only for immortals. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He would have called for Lysander, but the elite warrior angel was currently living in the heavens with Bianka and if there was a way to reach him, Aeron hadn\u2019t been told what it was. Besides, Lysander didn\u2019t like him and wasn\u2019t the type to willingly offer information about his race.</p><p>\u201cYou want to be the responsible one, fine. But admit it.\u201d Paris tossed him another grin. \u201cYou\u2019re staking a claim on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not.\u201d He didn\u2019t have even the smallest desire to do so. It was just that she was injured and couldn\u2019t take care of herself, and was therefore in no position to be anyone\u2019s bedmate. And that\u2019s all Paris would want her for. Sex. No matter what the warrior claimed.</p> <p>Besides, she\u2019d called for Aeron. Screamed Aeron\u2019s name.</p><p>Undeterred, Paris continued, \u201cAn angel isn\u2019t technically human, you know. An angel is something more.\u201d</p><p>Aeron popped his jaw. Of all the things for the man to remember from their earlier conversation. \u201cI said I\u2019m not staking a claim.\u201d</p><p>Paris laughed. \u201cWhatever you say, compadre. Enjoy your female.\u201d</p><p>Aeron\u2019s hands curled into fists, his friend\u2019s laughter not so welcome now. \u201cGo and tell Lucien everything we\u2019ve discussed, but under no circumstances are you to inform the women that there\u2019s a wounded angel here. They\u2019ll raid my room wanting to meet her and now is not the time for that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Do you plan to make out with her?\u201d</p><p>His teeth ground with so much force he feared they would soon be nothing but a fond memory. \u201cI plan to question her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. So that\u2019s what the kids are calling it these days. Well, have fun.\u201d With that, a still-grinning Paris strolled from the room.</p><p>Alone once more with his charge, Aeron gazed down at her. Her silent sobbing ended, at least, and she faced him again.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here, Olivia?\u201d Saying her name shouldn\u2019t have affected him\u2014he\u2019d said it before, after all\u2014but it did. His blood heated another degree. It must be those eyes of hers...piercing him...</p><p>A shuddering breath escaped her. \u201cI knew the consequences, knew I was giving up my wings, my abilities, my immortality, but I did it anyway. It\u2019s just...my job changed. Joy was no longer mine to give. Only death. And I hated what they wanted me to do. I couldn\u2019t do it, Aeron. I just couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>His name on her lips, uttered with such familiarity, affected him, too, and he sucked in a breath. What was wrong with him? Toughen up. Be the cold, hard warrior I know you can be.</p><p>\u201cI watched you,\u201d she continued, \u201cas well as those around you, and I...ached. I wanted you, and I wanted what they had\u2014freedom and love and fun. I wanted to play. I wanted to kiss and to touch. I wanted joy of my own.\u201d Her gaze met his, bleak, broken. \u201cIn the end, I had a choice. Fall...or kill you. I decided to fall. So here I am. Yours.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>YOURS. SHE SHOULDN\u2019T have said that.</p><p>Olivia froze in horror, one thought blasting through her mind louder than any other: she\u2019d just ruined everything.She should have eased Aeron into the truth. After all, every time she\u2019d approached him these past few weeks, he\u2019d threatened her with agony and death. That she\u2019d been invisible hadn\u2019t mattered. He\u2019d known she was nearby. How, she still hadn\u2019t figured out. She should have been imperceptible, as insubstantial as a phantom of the night. And now that she was here, in the flesh and spilling her secrets, he probably viewed her as even more of a threat. He probably viewed her as an enemy.</p><p>Probably? She laughed without humor. He did. His questions had lashed at her, cutting deep. Yep. She\u2019d ruined. He\u2019d want nothing to do with her now. Well, except to bestow that agony and death upon her.</p><p>You didn\u2019t fight your way from the depths of hell to be slaughtered in this fortress. She\u2019d fought her way out of hell for a chance with Aeron. Despite the chance of failure.</p><p>You can do this. Having surreptitiously watched him time and time again, she felt she knew him pretty well. He was disciplined, distanced and brutally honest. He trusted no one but his friends. Weakness was not a trait he tolerated. And yet, to those he loved, he was kind, nurturing and solicitous. He placed their well-being above his own. I want to be loved like that.</p> <p>If only he could have seen her before she\u2019d been kicked out of the only home she\u2019d ever known. If only he\u2019d seen her before her ability to fly had been taken away. Before her newfound skill of creating weapons from air had been obliterated. Before her capacity to shield herself from this world\u2019s evil had been removed.</p><p>Now...</p><p>She was weaker than a human. Having relied on her wings rather than her legs for the whole of her centuries-long existence, she didn\u2019t even know how to walk properly. What if she couldn\u2019t do this?</p><p>A sob escaped her. She\u2019d given up her home and friends for pain, humiliation and helplessness. If Aeron kicked her out, too, she\u2019d have nowhere to go.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d Aeron ground out.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...help...it,\u201d she replied between shuddering whimpers. Only once before had she shed tears\u2014and those had sprung because of Aeron, as well, when she\u2019d realized her feelings for him were completely overshadowing her sense of self-preservation.</p><p>The magnitude of what she\u2019d done was now a screaming force inside her head. She was alone, trapped in a frail body she didn\u2019t understand, and dependent on the mercy of a man who sometimes wreaked deathly havoc on an unsuspecting public. A public she, as a bringer of joy, had once been responsible for making happy.</p><p>\u201cTry, damn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you...maybe...I don\u2019t know...hold me?\u201d she said between gasps of air.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He sounded horrified by the thought. \u201cYou will simply desist immediately.\u201d</p><p>She cried all the harder. Had she been home her mentor, Lysander, would have gathered her close and cooed until she quieted. At least, she thought he would have done so, since the theory had never been tested.</p><p>Poor, sweet Lysander. Did he know she was gone? Did he know she could never return? He\u2019d known she was fascinated with Aeron, spending every free moment in this plane to watch him in secret, unable to complete the terrible task she\u2019d been given, but Lysander had never expected her to give up everything for the man.</p><p>To be honest, she hadn\u2019t, either. Not really.</p><p>Perhaps she should have since her troubles had begun even before she\u2019d first laid eyes on Aeron.</p><p>A few months ago, golden down appeared in her wings. But gold was the color of the warriors, and a warrior she had never longed to be. Even though it would have elevated her station.</p><p>Remembering her unhappiness, she sighed. There were three angelic castes. The Elite Seven, like Lysander, worked directly with the One True Deity. They had been selected at the beginning of time and never wavered in their duties to train other angels and monitor evil happenings. Next were the warriors. They destroyed the demons who managed to escape their fiery prisons. Last were the joy-bringers, as Olivia had once been.</p><p>Many of her brethren had experienced instant wing envy at the arrival of the golden down\u2014nothing malicious, of course\u2014but for the first time in her existence, she\u2019d been uncertain of her path. Why had she been chosen for such a duty?</p><p>She\u2019d loved the job she had. She\u2019d loved whispering beautiful affirmations in human ears, bringing them confidence and pleasure. The thought of hurting another living being, even a deserving one... She shuddered.</p><p>That\u2019s when she encountered those first thoughts about falling, about starting a new life. They\u2019d been innocent thoughts, really. What if and maybe...And when she spied Aeron, those thoughts had intensified. What if they could be together? Maybe they could live happily ever after.</p><p>What would it be like to be human?</p><p>So by the time the Heavenly High Council, a daunting body composed of angels from each of the three factions, had called her into their tribunal chamber, she had expected to be chastised for her failure to destroy Aeron. Instead, she\u2019d received an ultimatum.</p><p>She\u2019d stood in the center of a spacious, white room, the ceiling domed, the walls forming a perfect circle. Columns had stretched all around, even the ivy climbing them a stark, pristine white. A throne sat between each of those columns, a regal form perched in every one.</p><p>Do you know why you are here, Olivia? a resonant voice had asked.</p><p>Yes. Though she trembled, her wings never ceased their graceful glide. They were long and majestic, the feathers a glorious white threaded with moonlit gold. To discuss Aeron of the Underworld.</p><p>We\u2019ve been patient for weeks, Olivia. The emotionless voice had echoed like a war drum inside her head. We\u2019ve given you countless opportunities to prove yourself. You failed each time.</p><p>I\u2019m not meant to do this, she\u2019d replied shakily.</p><p>You were. You are. There is no better way to spread joy than to save humans from evil. And that is what you will be doing with the completion of this task. This is your last chance. You will end Aeron\u2019s life or we will end yours.</p><p>The councilor\u2019s threat hadn\u2019t been meant as a cruelty, she knew. That was simply the way of the heavens. A single drop of poison could ruin an ocean, and so every corrosive drop had to be wiped out before hitting the waves. Yet she\u2019d protested anyway.</p><p>You cannot kill me without the True Deity\u2019s blessing. And He would not give it. He was all that was tender and kind. He cared for his people, all of his people. Even wayward angels. Quite simply, He was love.</p><p>But we can send you away, ending life as you know it. The speaker had been female, but her voice was no less flat.</p><p>For a moment Olivia had had trouble catching her breath, and bright sparks of light had danced around her eyes. Lose her place? She\u2019d just purchased a newer, bigger cloud. She\u2019d promised to take over one of her friend\u2019s joy-bringing shifts so that he could go on vacation\u2014and she\u2019d never before broken a promise. Still she\u2019d persisted. Aeron isn\u2019t evil. He doesn\u2019t deserve to die. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That is not for you to decide. He ignored an ancient law and must be punished for it before others think that they can do the same without consequence.</p><p>I doubt he even knows what he\u2019s done. She\u2019d spread her arms, beseeching. If you would just allow him to see me and hear my voice, I could talk to him and explain\u2014</p><p>Then we would be ignoring an ancient law.</p><p>True. Faith was built on the principle that you believed in what you could not see. Only the Elite Seven were allowed to reveal themselves in the mortal plane, as they were sometimes tasked with rewarding people for that faith.</p> <p>I\u2019m sorry, she\u2019d said, head bowed. I should not have asked such a thing of you.</p><p>You are forgiven, child, they\u2019d replied in unison.</p><p>Forgiveness was always granted so easily here. Well, except when commandments were ignored. Poor Aeron, she\u2019d thought, even as she\u2019d said, Thank you.</p><p>It was just...Aeron drew her. He looked every inch the demon with his tattooed flesh, yet seeing him for the first time had roused desires inside her that had been too strong to ignore. What would it be like to touch him? What would it be like to be touched by him? Would she finally know the joy she brought to others?</p><p>At first, those thoughts had shamed her. And the better she\u2019d come to know Aeron, the stronger the desires had become\u2014until falling and being with him had been all she could think about.</p> <p>Finally, she\u2019d told herself it was acceptable to feel so strongly about him because, despite his appearance, despite what the Council said, he was honest and good. And if he was honest and good, she could do the things that he did, and be honest and good, as well. More than that, it would be okay because he, protector that he was, would keep her safe. From others, from herself.</p><p>If he were killed, however, she would live the rest of eternity never knowing how...exquisite experiencing him in every way could have been. She would regret. She would mourn.</p><p>But to save him, from her own hand, at least, meant giving up everything she knew, as the Council had proclaimed. More than losing her home and her wings, however, she would also be stuck in a world where forgiveness was not always granted, patience was rarely rewarded and rudeness was a way of life.</p><p>He is your first assassination, so we do understand your reluctance, Olivia. But you cannot allow that reluctance to ruin you. You must rise above it or you will pay the price forevermore. Which will you choose?</p><p>That had been the Council\u2019s last-ditch effort to save her. Yet she had raised her head and uttered the words that had been churning inside her for all those weeks\u2014the words that led her here. Before fear could change her mind.</p><p>I choose Aeron.</p> <p>\u201cWoman?\u201d</p><p>The hard voice shook Olivia from the past; it was deeper, richer than anyone else\u2019s and...necessary. She blinked, her surroundings slowly coming into focus. A bedroom she knew by heart. Spacious, with silver stone walls plastered with portraits of flowers and stars. The floor was composed of dark, polished wood, and draped by a soft pink rug. There was a dresser, a vanity and a young girl\u2019s lounge.</p><p>Many would have scoffed at the fact that this strong, proud warrior possessed such a feminine room, but not Olivia. The furnishings merely proved the depths of Aeron\u2019s love for his Legion.</p><p>Did he have room in his heart for one more?</p><p>Her gaze landed on him. Still he stood beside the bed she was sprawled upon, gazing down at her with...no emotion, she realized, disappointed. And who could blame him? What a sight she must be. The tears had dried on her cheeks, making her skin feel tight and hot. Her hair hung in tangles, and dirt streaked her exposed skin.</p><p>Meanwhile, he looked gorgeous. He was tall and mouthwateringly muscled, with the most amazing violet eyes fringed by long black lashes. His dark hair was cropped nearly to his scalp, and she wondered if the choppy strands would prickle her palm when she caressed them.</p><p>Not that he would allow her to caress him.</p><p>He was heavily tattooed, even on the perfectly sculpted planes of his face. Each of those tattoos depicted something gruesome. Stabbings, stranglings, burnings, blood\u2014so much blood\u2014each skeletal face etched in torment. Yet amid all the violence were two sapphire butterflies, one riding his ribs and one outlining the wings on his back.</p> <p>The other Lords, she had noticed, only had one butterfly tattoo, each a mark of their demon-possession, and she\u2019d often wondered why Aeron had the extra. Wasn\u2019t as if his body contained two demons or anything.</p><p>More than that, he despised weakness. Didn\u2019t the butterflies remind him of his folly? For that matter, didn\u2019t the other tattoos, the violent ones, remind him of the terrible things his demon had forced him to do?</p><p>As for Olivia, why didn\u2019t this man repulse her as he would have repulsed any other angel? Why did he continue to fascinate her?</p><p>\u201cWoman,\u201d he repeated, impatient now.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she managed to croak.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t listening to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho wanted me dead? And why?\u201d</p><p>Rather than answer, she begged, \u201cSit down, please. Looking up at you like this is straining my neck.\u201d</p><p>At first, she didn\u2019t think he would comply. Then he surprised her by easing to his haunches, his expression gentling. Finally, their gazes were level and she could see that his pupils were dilating. Odd. That usually happened when humans were happy. Or angry. He was neither.</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now answer me.\u201d</p><p>Such a commander. She didn\u2019t mind, though. The reward was too great. Now she could drink in the wonderfully wicked sight of him without effort, while talking to him as she\u2019d dreamed of doing all these weeks. \u201cThe Heavenly High Council wants you dead because you helped a demon escape from hell.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cMy Legion?\u201d</p><p>His Legion? Olivia nodded, winced. Pain wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d ever experienced before\u2014mentally or physically\u2014and she wasn\u2019t sure how she was withstanding it. Lucidly, at least.</p><p>Or maybe she did know. Humans produced adrenaline and other hormones, which numbed them somewhat. Maybe she was producing those things, too, human that she now was. More and more, she began to feel pleasantly distanced from her new body and its unfamiliar aches and emotions.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Legion had already crawled free by the time we met. I did nothing to earn anyone\u2019s...wrath.\u201d His mouth tightened on that last word.</p><p>\u201cActually, you did. Without you, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to reach the surface because she was bound to the underground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyelids, suddenly heavy and seemingly laced with sandpaper, closed\u2014oh, to discuss something else\u2014but she forced them to reopen. \u201cFor the most part, demons are able to leave hell only when they\u2019re summoned to earth. It\u2019s a little loophole we didn\u2019t catch until too late. Anyway, when they\u2019re summoned, their bond with hell breaks and in its place they become bound to the summoner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut again, I didn\u2019t summon Legion. She came to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you didn\u2019t consciously summon her, but the moment you accepted her as yours, it was as if you\u2019d done so.\u201d</p><p>He flexed and unflexed his hands, a gesture she knew he made while trying to get himself under control. Perhaps he was angry. \u201cShe has every right to walk this earth. I am demon, and I have done so for thousands of years without punishment.\u201d</p><p>True. \u201cBut your demon is trapped inside you. Therefore you are its hell. Legion is now unfettered, able to come and go as she pleases. Which means she has no hell, and that defies all heavenly rules.\u201d</p><p>She could see he was preparing to argue. Perhaps it would help to explain the origins of hell.</p><p>\u201cThe more powerful demons were once angels. Only, they fell. They were the first to fall, actually, and their hearts were blackened, all goodness wiped from them. So, rather than lose their wings and powers, they were punished to suffer forevermore. A tradition that has continued with their offspring. There can be no exceptions. Demons must be bound to some sort of hell. Those who break that bond are killed.\u201d</p><p>Red seeped into his irises, glowing brightly. \u201cYou\u2019re saying Legion has no hell, and because of this, she must die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re also saying she was once an angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Once in hell, the demons learned how to procreate. Legion is one of those creations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think to punish her, even though she has caused no harm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me, but yes. Even though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstand me now. I will allow no harm to befall her.\u201d Calmly stated, but no less violent.</p><p>Olivia remained silent. She wouldn\u2019t lie to him and tell him what he wanted to hear. That he and Legion were safe now, their crimes forgotten by those in the heavens. Eventually, someone would come to do what Olivia had been unable to.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t deserve to be there,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t for you to decide.\u201d The rebuke emerged softly, as gently as she was able. That the words were an echo of what the Council had said to her left a bad taste in her mouth.</p><p>Aeron drew in a rough breath, his nostrils flaring. \u201cYou fell. Why aren\u2019t you being thrown into hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first angels to fall turned their backs on the One True Deity, hence their blackened hearts. I did not turn my back. I merely chose a different path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why were you sent to me now? Not as one of the fallen, but as an executioner? Thousands of years ago, I did far more terrible things than break a little demon\u2019s bond to hell. All of us here did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Council agreed with the gods that you and your brethren were the only ones capable of housing, and perhaps one day controlling, the escaped demons. As I said, you are their hell, and you have been punished for those early crimes sufficiently.\u201d</p><p>Victory claimed his features, as if he\u2019d caught her in an untruth. \u201cWrath will be freed the moment of my death, escaping his so-called hell. What of that? You still think to kill me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>If only that loophole had not been closed... \u201cOnce, we were forbidden to kill demon High Lords, and that is what your Wrath is. Then they escaped the depths, forcing us to change our rules accordingly. So...I was to kill Wrath, as well.\u201d</p><p>The admission caused his victorious expression to fade. \u201cYou fell. That means you didn\u2019t agree with the edict. With killing me, my demon and Legion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true,\u201d she said. \u201cI think you should be spared, yes. And Wrath, too, since the demon is a part of you. Do I think Legion should be permitted to live in this world? No. She is a menace in ways you haven\u2019t yet learned, and she\u2019ll most likely cause untold harm. I fell because\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou wanted freedom and love and fun,\u201d he said, parroting her earlier words. Only, his were sneered. \u201cWhy were you chosen for this task? Have you killed before?\u201d</p><p>She gulped, not wanting to admit how things had unfolded but knowing she owed him an explanation. \u201cThe dark one, Reyes...he has visited the heavens many times because of his woman, Danika. I saw him once and followed him here, curious about the life a demon-possessed warrior could have built for himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Aeron scowled over at her. \u201cYou followed Reyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hadn\u2019t she just said that?</p><p>\u201cBut you followed Reyes.\u201d Anger radiated from him, body and tone.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, understanding. Suddenly she wished she\u2019d kept that part of the story to herself. She knew how protective Aeron was of his friends, and his dislike of her had to be growing by the minute. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt him, though. I...I spent every day afterward traipsing these grounds.\u201d Following you. Wanting you. \u201cI was chosen because I, better than anyone, knew your routine.\u201d</p><p>Or had the elders sensed her mounting desire for him, and thought that if she were the one to eliminate Aeron, she would eliminate that appalling desire, as well? She\u2019d often wondered.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, Reyes has a woman.\u201d Aeron arched a brow, disrupting the etching of ghostly souls on his forehead. Screaming souls rising toward damnation. \u201cBut that hardly matters. I want to know how you would have killed me.\u201d</p><p>She would have formed a sword of fire, just as Lysander had taught her, and taken his head. That was the quickest death an angel could deliver, she was told. The quickest and the most merciful, over and done with before a single thread of pain could be felt.</p><p>\u201cThere are ways,\u201d was all she said.</p><p>\u201cBut you fell and are now unable to complete your mission,\u201d Aeron replied, and now his voice was tight with dread. \u201cSomeone else will be sent in your place, won\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>Finally he was beginning to understand. She nodded.</p><p>His frown gave way to another scowl. \u201cLike I said, I will allow no harm to befall Legion. She\u2019s mine, and I protect what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>Oh, to be his, she thought, the longing inside her fiercer than her lingering pain. That\u2019s why she was here, after all. Better to experience a moment with him than a lifetime with anyone else.</p><p>She would have liked more than a moment, yes, but a moment was all they had. When her replacement came, and he would, Aeron would die. Though her heart sank at the thought, the circumstances were as simple as that. Aeron would be defenseless against an opponent he could not see, hear or touch. An opponent who would be able to see, hear and touch him.</p><p>And, knowing heavenly justice as she did, that replacement would be Lysander. Olivia had failed, and so her mentor would be held responsible for her shortcoming.</p><p>Lysander wouldn\u2019t hesitate to deliver the final blow. He never did. Yes, he was different now that he\u2019d mated with Bianka, a Harpy and descendant of Lucifer himself. But to walk away from Aeron meant that Lysander, too, would have to fall. He would have to give up his forever with Bianka, and that was not something the elite warrior would do. Bianka had become his everything.</p><p>\u201cI thank you for the warning.\u201d Aeron pushed to his feet. If he\u2019d said something before that, she\u2019d missed it, distracted as she\u2019d been. What was wrong with her? She\u2019d come here for him, but since her arrival, she\u2019d mostly retreated into her mind.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. But there\u2019s something I\u2019d like in return. I\u2014I would like to stay here,\u201d she rushed out. \u201cWith you. I can even help with your maid duties, if you\u2019d like.\u201d So many times she\u2019d watched Aeron clean this fortress, grumbling about his hatred for the assigned chore.</p> <p>He bent down to untie her wrists, his motions so tender he elicited only the barest twinges of pain. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that isn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why? I won\u2019t be any trouble. Honest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have already caused trouble.\u201d</p><p>Her chin started trembling again, the emotional numbness she\u2019d experienced fading quickly. He still plans to get rid of me. Fear, confusion, despair all bombarded her. She buried her face in the pillow, not wanting Aeron to see. She was already at enough of a disadvantage with him.</p><p>\u201cWoman,\u201d he growled. \u201cI told you not to cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t hurt my feelings.\u201d The words were muffled from the cotton pressed against her lips\u2014and yes, from her tears.</p><p>There was a rustle of clothing, as if he were shifting from one foot to the other. \u201cHurt your feelings? You should be grateful I haven\u2019t killed you. You caused me untold grief this past month. I had no idea who followed me or why. My loyal companion couldn\u2019t remain with me and had to return to a place she loathes.\u201d</p><p>A place she deserved to be, despite Aeron\u2019s earlier assertion, but whatever, as some of the Lords were fond of saying. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Despite everything, she really was. Soon, he would lose all he valued and there would be nothing either of them could do to stop it from happening.</p><p>Don\u2019t think like that or you\u2019ll start crying again.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI accept your apology, but that doesn\u2019t change anything. You aren\u2019t welcome here.\u201d</p><p>He forgave her? Finally, a step in the right direction. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are fallen, but you\u2019re still immortal. Yes?\u201d He didn\u2019t give her time to reply. Her clothing had healed itself, so in his mind it probably stood to reason that she would, too. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine by morning. And then I\u2019ll want you out of this fortress.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>AERON PACED THE LENGTH of the hallway. He\u2019d been at it for hours, but saw no reprieve in his immediate future. Someone had to guard the angel. Not from intruders but from her intrusion, just in case she was here to sneak about and listen to things she shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>A rationalization that didn\u2019t make a lot of sense, but one he would stick with. Yes, she could have listened to things she shouldn\u2019t have as an angel, invisible and protected, but she was vulnerable now, and she could one day be captured by the Hunters and used to hurt his friends.His hands fisted, and he forced his mind to retreat from thoughts of her torture and their deaths before he punched a wall. Or a friend.</p><p>Besides, when Olivia was well enough, which should be any time now, part of him expected her to try and escape his room to hunt for Legion. Even though Legion was absent, that wasn\u2019t something Aeron would allow. Not that Olivia, fallen as she now was, could do much damage during her search.</p><p>Still. She could reveal her findings to another angel, the one she predicted would come, and that angel could attempt to see the deed done.</p><p>Not on my watch, he thought.</p><p>His friends had already had their meeting\u2014he\u2019d heard their mutterings, then their laughter, then their footsteps as they parted\u2014but he had no idea what had been decided. No one had visited him. Were they going to pursue the odd female he\u2019d met in that alley? Had Lucien found any sign of Hunters on the hill?</p><p>Aeron hadn\u2019t changed his mind; he didn\u2019t believe Olivia was involved with them. But they could have followed her here. Sneak attacks were their specialty, after all.</p><p>And really, an invasion would be the perfect end to this terrible night.</p><p>Half an hour ago, he\u2019d called for Legion to warn her about what was happening. Usually, no matter the distance between them, she heard his cry and came to him. Not this time. Like Lucien, she could flash from one location to another with only a thought, but she hadn\u2019t appeared.</p><p>Was she hurt? Bound? He was tempted to formally summon her, just as she\u2019d taught him\u2014though until Olivia\u2019s explanation, he hadn\u2019t understood what she meant\u2014for that wasn\u2019t something she could ignore. The more he\u2019d considered the possibility, the more he\u2019d thought it likely that the angel\u2014fallen or not\u2014had to be out of the fortress before Legion would feel comfortable enough to return. He remembered her fear, the way she\u2019d trembled even uttering the word angel.</p><p>He could have asked Olivia to stop doing whatever she was doing that pained the little demon and not him. Or his friends, for that matter. They\u2019d never sensed Olivia, not in any way. But he hadn\u2019t asked. She was healing, and he didn\u2019t want to disturb her.</p><p>Especially when she\u2019d done so much for him already. No softening.</p><p>So he\u2019d left Legion alone, as well. For now.</p><p>Not that he could imagine the fragile Olivia hurting anyone. Even at full strength\u2014whatever that was. Should it come to a fight, Legion would have the angel pinned, those poisoned fangs deep inside Olivia\u2019s vein, in seconds.</p><p>That\u2019s my girl, he thought, grinning. Only, his grin didn\u2019t last. The thought of Olivia dying didn\u2019t sit well. She hadn\u2019t killed him as she\u2019d been ordered. Not that she could have, but she hadn\u2019t even tried to do so. Nor had she harmed Legion, as she\u2019d probably wished to. She wanted only to experience the joys of life she\u2019d clearly been denied.</p><p>She didn\u2019t deserve to die.</p><p>For a moment, only a moment, he thought about keeping her. As calm as Wrath was around her, not demanding he punish her for some crime she\u2019d committed twenty years ago, a day ago, a minute ago, she would be the perfect companion for him. She could see to his needs, as Paris had said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Needs he\u2019d claimed not to have. But he couldn\u2019t deny that while he\u2019d been crouched beside her, something had stirred inside him. Something hot and dangerous. She\u2019d smelled of sunshine and earth, and her eyes, as blue and clear as the morning sky, had regarded him with trust and hope. As if he were a savior rather than a destroyer. And he\u2019d liked it.</p><p>Idiot! A demon, keeping an angel? Hardly. Besides, she\u2019s here to have fun and you, my friend, are as far from fun as a man can be.</p><p>\u201cAeron.\u201d</p> <p>Finally. News. Relieved to push Olivia from his thoughts, Aeron whipped around and saw Torin leaning one shoulder against the wall, gloved arms crossed over his chest and an irreverent smile curling his mouth.</p><p>As keeper of Disease, Torin couldn\u2019t touch another being skin to skin without beginning a plague. The gloves protected them all.</p><p>\u201cOnce again, a Lord of the Underworld has a woman locked in his chambers while he tries to figure out what to do with her.\u201d Torin chuckled.</p><p>Before Aeron could reply, images began flashing through his head. Images of Torin lifting a blade, expression intent, determined. That blade descended...nailed its target in the heart...and emerged wet and red.</p><p>The man who\u2019d been stabbed, a human, collapsed into a heap on the ground. Dead. There was a figure eight tattooed on his wrist, the symbol of infinity and the mark of a Hunter. He hadn\u2019t hurt Torin, hadn\u2019t even threatened to do so. The two had simply passed each other on the street, some four hundred years ago, when the warrior had left the fortress to finally be with the woman he\u2019d fallen for, but had first spied the brand and attacked.</p> <p>To Wrath, the act was malicious and without provocation. To Wrath, the act deserved punishment.</p><p>Aeron had seen this particular event many times already, and each time he\u2019d had to suppress the urge to act. Now was no different. He actually felt his fingers curling around the hilt of his dagger, the need to stab Torin as Torin had stabbed the Hunter strong.</p><p>I would have done the same thing, he mentally shouted at the demon. I would have killed that Hunter, maliciously and without provocation. Torin doesn\u2019t deserve castigation.</p><p>Wrath growled.</p><p>Calm. Aeron\u2019s arm fell to his side, his hand empty.</p><p>\u201cDemon wanting a go at me?\u201d Torin asked matter-of-factly.</p> <p>His friends knew him very well. \u201cYes, but no worries. I\u2019ve got the bastard under control.\u201d</p><p>He thought he heard the demon snort.</p><p>The more he denied Wrath, the more its desire to penalize would grow\u2014until the need overtook Aeron so completely, he would snap. That was when he\u2019d fly into town, no one safe, the slightest sins met with absolute cruelty and ruthlessness.</p><p>Those vengeance sprees were the reason Aeron had tattooed himself as he had. As he was immortal and prone to heal quickly, he\u2019d had to mix dried ambrosia into the ink to be permanently marked and it had been like injecting fire straight into his veins. Had he minded, though? Hell, no. Every time he looked into the mirror, he was reminded of the things he\u2019d done\u2014and what he would do again if he wasn\u2019t careful.</p><p>But more than that, the tattoos assured him that the people he\u2019d killed, the ones who hadn\u2019t deserved to die, would never truly be forgotten. Sometimes that helped ease his guilt. And sometimes it helped dim his irrational pride in the demon\u2019s strength.</p><p>\u201c\u2014sure you have control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, pulling himself from his thoughts.</p><p>Torin grinned again. \u201cI asked if you were sure you had control of your demon. You\u2019re winking in and out, and your eyes are glowing red.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Unlike Olivia, there wasn\u2019t utter truth in his voice. The lie was there for all to hear.</p><p>\u201cI believe you. Really. So...back to our conversation?\u201d Torin asked.</p><p>Where had he gotten sidetracked? Oh, yes. \u201cI\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t come here to compare me to our mated friends. I\u2019m hardly the love-struck fool all of them were when they brought their women here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just like that, you\u2019ve ruined my next three jokes. You\u2019re no fun.\u201d</p><p>Exactly what Aeron had thought when Olivia had mentioned her three desires. Having the knowledge confirmed, though, scraped him up inside for reasons he couldn\u2019t explain. \u201cTorin. Your purpose, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Your angel\u2019s already causing problems. Some of us want to get rid of her, and some want to keep her. I\u2019m on Team Keep. I think we need to charm her to our side before you make her hate us all and she decides to help the enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay away from her.\u201d Aeron didn\u2019t want the warrior anywhere near Olivia. And it had nothing to do with the man\u2019s white hair, black brows and green eyes that never seemed to take anything seriously, ensuring Torin didn\u2019t need to touch a woman to win her.</p><p>Torin rolled those eyes. \u201cMoron. You should be thanking me, not threatening me. I came to tell you to hide her. William\u2019s on my team and he wants to be the one to do the charming.\u201d</p><p>William, an immortal with a sex addiction. An immortal with black hair and blue eyes even more wicked than Torin\u2019s. A warrior who was tall, muscled and untamed. A warrior whose only tattoos were hidden under his clothes. If Aeron was remembering correctly, there was an X over his heart and a treasure map on his back. A treasure map that crossed his ribs and dipped around his waist, finally ending over his \u201cfun zone.\u201d</p><p>He was a \u201creal beefcake\u201d\u2014if human females could be believed\u2014and was the epitome of fun.</p><p>Olivia would probably like him.</p><p>Why did Aeron suddenly want to bash the man\u2019s face into the wall, ruining those pretty looks? Something he\u2019d never wanted to do before, despite Wrath\u2019s intense need to punish the man, breaking his heart into hundreds of pieces the way he\u2019d done to hundreds of women. Only, Wrath wanted Aeron to use a blade.</p><p>Aeron had always resisted because he liked William, who may not be a true Lord, but who could be counted on during battle. The man had no limitations when it came to killing.</p><p>Without Legion, you\u2019re looking for a fight. That\u2019s all. Yes. Clearly he was on edge.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Torin, for the warning about William,\u201d he said, hoping he sounded properly wry. \u201cThough Olivia won\u2019t be here long enough to be charmed by anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure William would tell you he only needs a few seconds.\u201d</p><p>Do not react. Although, if William showed up, Aeron could \u201caccidentally\u201d lose control of Wrath, allowing the demon to finally have a go at the immortal.</p><p>Wrath purred his approval.</p><p>\u201cOh, hey,\u201d Torin said, claiming his attention. \u201cSwitching the topic from one sex addict to another, Paris wanted me to tell you that Lucien flashed him into town to find a woman. Lucien planned on leaving him there, so he won\u2019t be back until morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d His relief had nothing to do with Paris being far away from Olivia. \u201cDid Lucien see any sign of Hunters while he was out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Not on the hill and not in Buda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Aeron repeated, kicking back into motion. From one corner to the other he paced. \u201cWas there any sign of the dark-haired woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but Paris promised to continue looking for her. Once he regained his strength, of course. And speaking of lost strength, Paris mentioned that the angel is injured. Do you want me to have someone fetch a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFetch\u201d meant \u201cabduct\u201d in this household. \u201cNo. She\u2019ll heal on her own.\u201d They\u2019d been on the lookout for a doctor to permanently employ for some time, but they\u2019d had no luck. Now time was of the essence, since Ashlyn was pregnant. But no one knew if the baby would be mortal or demon, so they had to be careful whom they chose.</p><p>Hunters, as they\u2019d recently learned, had been breeding immortals with mortals for years, spawning halfling children in the hopes of creating an unstoppable army. The demon of Violence\u2019s baby would be a prize among prizes, someone every Hunter would love to use. And in the hands of the wrong doctor, the Lords\u2019 secrets would be anything but safe.</p><p>Torin shook his head in sympathy, as if Aeron were too dim-witted to think things through properly. \u201cYou sure she\u2019ll heal? She was kicked out of the heavens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were kicked out of the heavens, yet we heal as fast as ever. We even regenerate limbs.\u201d Which Gideon, keeper of the demon of Lies, was now in the process of doing. The warrior had been captured during their last battle with Hunters and tortured for information\u2014information he had not given. In retaliation, the Hunters had removed both of his hands.</p><p>Gideon was still bedbound and a major pain in everyone\u2019s ass.</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Torin said.</p><p>A woman\u2019s scream suddenly burst from Aeron\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>He stopped pacing, and Torin straightened. By the time the second scream sounded, both were running for the room, though Torin kept a good distance between them. Aeron threw open the door, the first inside.</p><p>Olivia was on the bed, still lying on her stomach but now thrashing. Her eyes were closed, and despite the shadows her lashes cast, he could see that bruises now branched under them. That dark hair was in tangles around her trembling shoulders.</p><p>Her robe had obviously cleaned itself, most of the blood gone. Yet there were two new stains where her wings should have already begun to grow back, both bright crimson and wet.</p><p>THE DEMONS were tugging on her.</p><p>Olivia could feel their claws digging into her skin, cutting, stinging. She could feel the sticky slime on their scales and the burn of their putrid breath. She could hear the glee in their laughter and wanted to vomit.\u201cLookie what I found,\u201d one of them cackled.</p><p>\u201cA pretty angel, fallen right into our arms,\u201d another chortled.</p><p>Plumes of sulfur and rot thickened the air, and the stench was sucked into her nostrils as she tried to catch her breath. She\u2019d just fallen, the clouds opening up under her feet, sending her tumbling from the heavens, down...down, no end in sight, flailing for something, anything to catch and stop herself...and when the end had finally appeared, the ground had opened up, too, the flames of hell swallowing her whole. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA warrior angel, at that.

She kicked and hit and bit, trying to fight her way free to run and hide, but there were too many demons around her, the jagged, rocky landscape behind them unfamiliar to her, so her efforts elicited no results. The tendons anchoring her wings in place began to tear; the scalding pain spread, consuming her until every thought in her head revolved around the easiest way to stop it: dying.</p> <p>Please. Let me die.</p><p>Stars winked over her eyes, suddenly the only thing she could see. Everything else had gone black. But black was good, black was welcome. Still, on and on the laughter and tugging continued. Dizziness soon flooded her, and nausea began churning in her stomach.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t she dead? Then one of her wings ripped free completely and she screamed, that scalding pain morphing into what she now knew was true agony. Not even death could end this kind of suffering. No, this would follow her into the afterlife.</p><p>The other wing quickly followed, and she screamed again and again and again. Claws continued to scrape at her clothing, damaging more of her skin and sinking inside the fresh wounds on her back. Finally, she did vomit, emptying her stomach of the heavenly fruits she\u2019d consumed just that morning.</p><p>\u201cNot so pretty now, are you, warrior?\u201d</p> <p>Hands squeezed at her, touching her in places no one had ever touched her before. Tears streamed down her cheeks, and she lay there, helpless. This was it. The end. Finally. Except, one thought glimmered in that sea of black: she\u2019d given up her beautiful life, only to die in hell without ever knowing joy, without spending time with Aeron. No. No!</p><p>You are stronger than this. Fight! Yes, yes. She was stronger than this. She would fight. She would\u2014</p><p>\u201cOlivia.\u201d</p><p>The hard, familiar voice swept through her mind, momentarily blocking the hated images, the pain and the sorrow. The determination.</p><p>\u201cOlivia. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>A nightmare, she thought, with a small hint of relief. Only a nightmare. Humans often had them. But she knew the assault had been much more to her. A memory, a replay of her time in hell.</p> <p>She still thrashed atop the bed, she realized, her back even now aflame, the rest of her bruised and knotted. Forcing herself to cease, she pried her eyelids apart. She was panting, chest swiftly lifting and falling against the mattress, air burning her nose and throat as if she were inhaling acid. Sweat dripped from her, soaking her robe to her skin. That blessed numbness she\u2019d experienced earlier was completely obliterated; she felt everything.</p><p>Death might have been preferable, after all.</p><p>Once more Aeron was crouched beside the bed and peering over at her. A male\u2014the one named Torin, she recalled\u2014stood beside him and watched her through haunted green eyes.</p><p>Demon, Olivia thought. Torin was a demon. Just like the others. The ones who had ripped out her wings. The ones who had touched her and taunted her.</p><p>A piercing scream coiled from her raw throat. She wanted Aeron, only Aeron; she didn\u2019t trust anyone else. Didn\u2019t want anyone else even looking at her right now. Especially a demon. That Aeron himself was possessed by Wrath had no bearing on the situation. To her, Aeron was simply Aeron. But all she could think about when she looked at Torin was how scaled hands had pinched her nipples and sunk between her legs. How those hands would have done far more if she hadn\u2019t begun fighting.</p><p>Fight. Yes. She kicked out her leg, but the foolish limb flopped uselessly, the muscles too tense to work properly. Helpless. Again. A sob joined her scream, both choking from her as she then tried to scramble from the bed and throw herself into Aeron\u2019s arms. But once more, her feeble body refused to cooperate.</p><p>\u201cMake him leave, make him leave, make him leave,\u201d she shouted, burying her face in the pillow. Even looking at the newcomer was painful to her. She might know Torin on sight, but she didn\u2019t know him the way she knew Aeron. Didn\u2019t crave him the way she craved Aeron.</p><p>Aeron, who could make everything better, as he did for his friend Paris every night. Aeron, who could protect her as he did his little Legion. Aeron, who was so fierce he had scared her nightmares away.</p> <p>Strong hands settled on her shoulders and held her down to stop her renewed thrashing. \u201cShh. Shh now. You have to calm down before you injure yourself further.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Torin asked. \u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d</p><p>No. No, no, no. The demon was still here. \u201cMake him leave! You have to make him leave. Now. Right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you, angel,\u201d Torin said gently. \u201cI\u2019m here to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hysteria was bubbling up inside her, about to consume her and sweep her under. \u201cMake him leave. Please, Aeron, make him leave. Please.\u201d</p><p>Aeron growled low in his throat. \u201cTorin, damn it. Get the hell out of here. She\u2019s not going to calm down until you do.\u201d</p><p>There was a heavy sigh, sadness in the undertones, then blessedly, footsteps sounded.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Aeron called, and Olivia wanted to scream. \u201cDid Lucien flash to the States as planned the other day and purchase Tylenol for the women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs far as I know, yes,\u201d Torin replied.</p><p>They were conversing? Now? \u201cMake him leave!\u201d Olivia shouted.</p><p>\u201cBring me some,\u201d Aeron said, talking over her.</p><p>The door creaked open. Finally, the demon was leaving\u2014but he would return with human medicine. Olivia whimpered. She couldn\u2019t go through this again. Would probably die from fear alone.</p><p>\u201cJust throw it inside the room,\u201d Aeron added, as though sensing her thoughts.</p><p>Thank you, sweet merciful Deity in heaven. As Olivia slumped onto the mattress, the door clicked shut.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d Aeron said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s just you and me now.\u201d</p><p>She was trembling so violently, the entire bed shook. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me. Please, don\u2019t leave me.\u201d The plea proved just how weak she currently was, but she didn\u2019t care. She needed him.</p><p>Aeron smoothed the sweat-damp hair from her temples, his touch as soft as his voice. This couldn\u2019t be her Aeron, speaking to her so sweetly, caressing her so tenderly. The change in him was almost too vast to be believed. Why had he changed? Why was he treating her, a virtual stranger, as he usually only treated his friends?</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me to hold you earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you still wish it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Oh, yes. Whatever the reason for the change, it didn\u2019t matter. He was here, and he was giving her what she\u2019d desired for so long.</p><p>Very slowly, he eased beside her, careful not to jostle her. When he was stretched out, she inched forward until her head was resting in the groove of his strong, hot shoulder. The action lanced more of that debilitating pain through her, but being this close to him, finally touching him, was worth it. This was why she\u2019d come here.</p><p>He wrapped one arm around her lower back, still so careful of her wounds, and his warm breath trekked down her forehead. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you healing, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>She loved when he uttered her name. Like a prayer and a plea, wrapped in the same pretty package. \u201cI told you. I fell. I\u2019m fully human now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFully human,\u201d he said, stiffening. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t tell me that. I could have brought you medicine sooner.\u201d</p><p>There was guilt in his tone. Guilt and dread. The dread she didn\u2019t understand, but was too wrung out to question. And then she forgot all about it. In the center of the room, an amber light sparked. That light grew...and grew...brightening so much she had to squint.</p><p>A body took shape. A big, muscled body draped in a white robe very similar to hers. Pale hair appeared next, waving to thick shoulders. She saw eyes like liquid onyx and pale skin with the slightest dusting of gilt. Last to fill her gaze were wings of pure, shimmering gold.</p><p>She wanted to wave but could only manage a faint grin. Sweet Lysander, here to comfort her at last, even as a figment of her imagination. \u201cI\u2019m dreaming again. Only, I like this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh, shh,\u201d Aeron whispered to her. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs am I.\u201d Lysander\u2019s gaze swept his surroundings and his lips curled with distaste. \u201cUnfortunately, this is no dream.\u201d As always, he spoke true, his voice as filled with certainty as hers.</p><p>This was truly happening? \u201cBut I\u2019m human now. I shouldn\u2019t be able to see you.\u201d Actually, seeing him was now against the rules. Unless her Deity thought to reward her? Given that she\u2019d just turned her back on her heritage, that hardly seemed likely.</p><p>Now he peered straight into her eyes\u2014straight, it seemed, into her soul. \u201cI petitioned the Council on your behalf. They\u2019ve agreed to give you one more chance. And so, right now, a part of you is still angelic and will remain so for the next fourteen days. Fourteen days in which you may change your mind and reclaim your rightful place.\u201d</p><p>Like a bolt of lightning, shock lanced through her, burning and sizzling. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d No fallen angel had ever been given a second chance before.</p><p>\u201cNothing to understand,\u201d Aeron said, still trying to soothe her. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am of the Seven, Olivia. I wanted fourteen days for you, and so you were given fourteen days. To live here, to...enjoy. And then, to return.\u201d Lysander\u2019s affronted tone proclaimed his status should explain everything.</p><p>It did not, but still the hope in his voice saddened her. The only thing she regretted about her choice was hurting this amazing warrior. He loved her, desired only the best for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I won\u2019t change my mind.\u201d</p><p>He appeared thunderstruck. \u201cEven when the immortal is taken from you?\u201d</p><p>She barely managed to stop her horrified cry. I\u2019m not ready to lose him. But weak as she was, there was nothing she could do to save him, and she knew it. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. Calm yourself. I\u2019m not here to kill him.\u201d The word yet was unsaid, but present all the same. \u201cIf you decide to stay, his new executioner will not be decided until your fourteen days have passed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So. She was guaranteed two weeks with Aeron. No more, no less. That would have to be enough. She would make so many memories, they would last a lifetime. If she could convince Aeron to let her stay here, that is. As stubborn as he was...</p><p>She sighed. \u201cThank you,\u201d she told Lysander. \u201cFor everything. You didn\u2019t have to do this for me.\u201d And had probably had to fight the Council mercilessly for such a concession, one of the Seven or not. Yet he\u2019d done so, without hesitation, just so she might experience the joy and passion she craved before reclaiming her place in heaven. She wouldn\u2019t tell him that she could not go back. No matter what happened.</p><p>In fourteen days, if she did return, she would be expected to kill Aeron, she knew\u2014and still she would not be able to do so. \u201cI love you. I hope you know that. No matter what happens.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d Aeron said, clearly confused.</p><p>\u201cHe cannot see, hear or even sense me,\u201d Lysander explained. \u201cHe now realizes you are not talking to him and thinks you are hallucinating from the pain.\u201d Her mentor stepped toward the bed. \u201cI must remind you that the man is a demon, Liv. He is everything we fight against.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs is your female.\u201d</p><p>He squared his wide shoulders, and his chin lifted. Ever the stubborn warrior, her Lysander. Just like Aeron. \u201cBianka broke none of our laws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut even if she had, you would have wanted to be with her. You would have found a way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d Aeron repeated.</p><p>Lysander paid him no heed. \u201cWhy would you choose to live with him as a human, Olivia? Just for a few minutes in his arms? That can bring you nothing but heartache and disappointment.\u201d</p><p>Once again, there was undiluted truth in his tone. Lies were not permitted in their\u2014no, his, she thought sadly\u2014world. Still, she refused to believe him. Here, she would do things she desperately wanted to do. Not only would she live as a human, but she would feel as one, too.</p><p>The bedroom door swung open, saving her from replying. A small plastic bottle was tossed inside. It landed on the floor a few inches from Lysander\u2019s sandaled feet.</p><p>\u201cHere are the meds,\u201d Torin called. The door shut before Olivia could work up another scream.</p><p>Aeron made to rise, but Olivia settled her weight more firmly atop him. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, grimacing as another of those burning bolts struck her. \u201cStay.\u201d</p> <p>He could have pushed her aside, but didn\u2019t. \u201cI need to get the pills. They\u2019ll help ease your pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d she said. Now that they were touching, now that she felt the warmth of his body, wrapping around her, soothing her, she didn\u2019t want to lose it. Even for a moment.</p><p>At first, she thought he would disregard her plea, but then he relaxed and tightened his hold on her. Olivia sighed with contentment and met Lysander\u2019s hard gaze once more. He was scowling.</p><p>\u201cThis is why,\u201d she told him. Cuddling wasn\u2019t something angels did. They could have, if they\u2019d so wanted, she supposed, but none ever had. Why would they? They were like brothers and sisters to each other, physical desire not part of their makeup.</p><p>\u201cWhy what?\u201d Aeron asked, confused all over again.</p><p>\u201cWhy I like you,\u201d she answered honestly.</p><p>He stiffened, but didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>Eyes narrowed, Lysander spread his wings in one smooth jerk, the gold glistening in the moonlight. A single feather drifted to the floor. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to your recovery, pet, but I will return. You don\u2019t belong here. As the days pass, I have a feeling you, too, will realize that.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>THAT FIRST NIGHT, after Olivia finished her strange conversation with herself, she finally fell back asleep, once again moaning and groaning with her pain, thrashing and hurting herself further. The second night, the mutterings about demons began. Don\u2019t touch me, you filthy wretch. Whimper, gag. Please, don\u2019t touch me. The third night, a deathly stillness claimed her.</p><p>Aeron almost preferred the begging.Through it all, he mopped her brow, kept her company\u2014even reading one of Paris\u2019s romance novels to her, though she remained unaware\u2014and forced liquids and crushed pills down her throat. He would not have her death on his conscience.</p><p>More than that, he wanted her out of his life\u2014no matter how strongly his body reacted when he neared her. Or thought of her. He hadn\u2019t lied. Once she was healed, she was gone. Because of how his body reacted.</p><p>Worse, the way his demon reacted. Not to her, but for her.</p><p>Punish, the demon said for the...what? Hundredth time? Punish the ones who hurt her. During Aeron\u2019s blood-curse, the demon had spoken to him\u2014in one-word commands\u2014in addition to flashing violent images through his mind. For the past three days, though, extended speech was Wrath\u2019s preferred method of communicating, and Aeron wasn\u2019t quite used to it. Where was the peace Olivia elicited?</p><p>Also, he wasn\u2019t sure what Olivia had been through when she\u2019d been kicked from her home, and he couldn\u2019t allow himself to find out. He might not be able to stop his demon from acting. Could barely stop the demon now. And if he knew the truth, he might not want to stop his demon. If ever there was a time to enjoy what Wrath could do...</p><p>Don\u2019t think like that. Aeron didn\u2019t want to soften toward Olivia any more than he already had, and he didn\u2019t want her sinking deeper into his thoughts and decisions. His life had enough complications. And already she\u2019d added more.</p><p>She wanted to have fun. As he\u2019d assured her, fun wasn\u2019t a word he was acquainted with, nor did he have time to learn. And he wasn\u2019t disappointed about that. Truly.</p><p>She wanted to love. In no way was he right for that task. Romantic love wasn\u2019t something he would ever bring to the table. Especially with someone as fragile as Olivia. And he wasn\u2019t disappointed about that, either. Truly.</p><p>She wanted freedom. That he could give her. In town. If she would just get better, damn her!</p><p>She would get better, or by the gods he would finally unleash his demon, willingly and without restraint.</p><p>Punish. Punish the ones who hurt her.</p><p>Why did the demon like her? And Wrath had to like her. Nothing else explained the urge to strike at beings they hadn\u2019t personally encountered. He\u2019d had time to think about this, way too much time, yet no answers had materialized.</p><p>Aeron scrubbed a hand down his face. Because he refused to leave Olivia\u2019s side, Lucien had had to continue seeing to Paris\u2019s care and ensuring the warrior fed his own demon properly. Torin, in turn, had had to see to Aeron\u2019s meals, bringing him trays of food throughout the day, but never staying to talk with him. If Olivia were to awaken and see the male... He didn\u2019t relish a repeat of her earlier terror.</p><p>Unfortunately, the women of the house had learned of the angel\u2019s presence and had descended en masse to welcome her. Not that he\u2019d let them past the door. No telling how Olivia would react to them. Besides, none of them had known how to help the angel. He\u2019d asked. Fine. He\u2019d snarled.</p><p>Although he might have endured fits of terror from Olivia if it meant seeing her conscious again. Why the hell would she not awaken? And now, as still as she was... He rolled to his side, careful not to jostle her, and stared down at her. For the first time, she didn\u2019t curl into him but remained as she was. Her skin was ghostly pale, her veins visible and garish. Her hair was a matted nest around her head. Her cheeks were hollowed out and her lips scabbed from where she\u2019d chewed them.</p><p>Yet she was still beyond beautiful. Exquisite, even, in a protect-me-forever kind of way. So much so, his chest constricted at the sight of her. Not in guilt, but in a possessive need to be the one doing the protecting. A need that ran bone-deep.</p><p>She had to heal, and he had to get rid of her. Soon.</p><p>\u201cAt this rate, she\u2019s going to die,\u201d he snarled to the ceiling. Whether he was speaking to her One Deity or to the gods he knew, he wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cIs that what you want? One of your own to suffer unimaginably before perishing? You can save her.\u201d</p><p>Look at you, he thought, disgusted with himself. Pleading for a life as the humans never do.</p><p>That didn\u2019t stop him. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The barest hint of a...growl? hit his ears. Aeron tensed. As he palmed one of the daggers he\u2019d placed on his nightstand, his gaze zoomed through his bedroom. He and Olivia were alone. No godly being had appeared to chastise him for his impudent tone.</p><p>Slowly he relaxed. Lack of sleep was finally catching up with him, he supposed.</p><p>Night had long since fallen, moonlight shimmering through the windowed doors leading to his balcony. So peaceful was the sight, so fatigued was his body, he should have finally drifted into slumber. He didn\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>What would he do if Olivia died? Would he mourn her as Paris mourned his Sienna? Surely not. He didn\u2019t know her. Most likely, he would feel guilt. Lots and lots of guilt. She had saved him, yet he wouldn\u2019t have done the same for her.</p><p>You don\u2019t deserve her.</p><p>The thought whispered through his head, and he blinked. It hadn\u2019t belonged to Wrath, the timbre too low, too gravelly\u2014and yet, somehow familiar. Had Sabin, keeper of Doubt, returned from Rome, attacking his self-confidence as was the warrior\u2019s unintentional habit?</p><p>\u201cSabin,\u201d he spat, just in case.</p><p>No response.</p><p>She\u2019s too good for you.</p><p>This time, Wrath rumbled inside his head, prowling through his skull, suddenly agitated.</p><p>Not Sabin, then. One, Aeron hadn\u2019t heard Sabin return and, two, he knew the warrior wasn\u2019t due to arrive for another few weeks. Plus, there was no gleeful undertone to these doubts, and Sabin\u2019s demon found great joy in the spreading of its poison.</p><p>So, who did that leave? Who possessed the power to speak in his mind?</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>That does not matter. I am here to heal her.</p><p>Heal her? Aeron relaxed just a little. There was a ring of truth in the voice, just as there was in Olivia\u2019s. Was this an angel? \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Save your thanks, demon.</p><p>Such anger from an angel? Probably not. Or was this a god, perhaps, answering his prayers? No, couldn\u2019t be, Aeron decided. The gods enjoyed their fanfare and would have relished the opportunity to reveal themselves and demand gratitude. And if this were Olivia\u2019s Deity, surely there would have been a hum of power in the air, at the very least. Instead, there was...nothing. Aeron sensed, smelled and felt nothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I have every faith that, when she awakens, she will begin to see you for what you really are.</p><p>Because of the being\u2019s certainty that she would awaken, Aeron didn\u2019t mind the implied insult. He was too relieved. \u201cAnd what am I?\u201d Not that he cared. But in the answer, he might learn who this speaker was.</p><p>Inferior, wicked, malicious, foolish, single-minded, rotten, unworthy and doomed.</p> <p>\u201cTell me how you really feel,\u201d he replied dryly, hoping his sarcasm hid his actions as he slowly edged over Olivia, using his body to shield hers. Wicked and malicious\u2014the beliefs of the Hunters. Yet a Hunter would have attacked Aeron before offering anyone aid. Even their Bait.</p><p>Again he wondered if this newcomer was an angel. Despite that anger. And clearly, hatred.</p><p>Another growl echoed. Your insolence only proves my point. Which is why I will allow her to get to know you as she desires, for I have a feeling she will not like what she learns. Just...do not soil her. If you do, I will bury you and all those you love.</p><p>\u201cI would never soil a\u2014\u201d</p><p>Silence. She awakens now.</p> <p>To prove the words, Olivia moaned. In that moment, the amount of relief that flooded him was irrational. Too much for someone he didn\u2019t know and wouldn\u2019t mourn. One thing he did know: whoever the speaker was, he was indeed powerful, to draw Olivia from that deathly slumber so quickly.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he said again. \u201cShe suffered unjustly and\u2014\u201d</p><p>I told you to be silent! If you dare disturb her healing process, demon...actually, I\u2019ve had all of you I can stand for one evening. Sleep.</p><p>Though he fought against it, his body seemed unable to refuse the command and sagged against the mattress, a few inches from Olivia. His eyelids closed and lethargy beat through him, dragging him kicking and screaming into the darkness he would have previously welcomed. Still, that darkness couldn\u2019t stop him from reaching for Olivia and drawing her into his side.</p><p>Where she belonged.</p><p>EYES STILL TOO HEAVY TO OPEN, Olivia stretched her arms over her head and arched her back, the knots unwinding from her muscles. Sooo good. Grinning, she drew in a deep breath that brought with it the scent of exotic spice and forbidden fantasies. Her cloud had never smelled this...sexy before. Nor had it ever been this warm, almost decadently so.</p> <p>She wanted to stay just like this forever, but laziness wasn\u2019t the way of the angels. Today she would visit Lysander, she decided. If he wasn\u2019t away on a secret mission as he often was, and if he hadn\u2019t locked himself away with his Bianka. Afterward, she would head to the fortress in Budapest. What would Aeron be doing today? Would his contradictions fascinate her once again? Would he sense her again, as he shouldn\u2019t have been able to do, then demand she reveal herself so that he could kill her?Those demands always hurt her feelings, though she couldn\u2019t blame him for his anger. He didn\u2019t know who she was or what her intentions were. I want him to know me, she thought. She was likeable; she really was. Well, to other angels, she was. She wasn\u2019t sure what a demon-possessed immortal warrior would think of the real her, his supposed opposite.</p><p>Only, Aeron didn\u2019t seem like a demon to her. Not in any way. He called Legion his \u201cprecious baby,\u201d bought her tiaras and decorated his room to fit her tastes. He\u2019d even had his friend and fellow Lord Maddox construct a lounge chair for her. A lounge chair that rested beside his bed and was draped with pink lace.</p><p>Olivia wanted her own lacy lounge chair in that bedroom.</p><p>Envy is not a good look for you, she reminded herself. You might not have a lacy lounge, but you have helped countless people laugh and rejoice and learn to love their lives. Yes, she took a great amount of satisfaction from that. But...now she wanted more. Maybe she\u2019d always wanted more, but just hadn\u2019t realized it until her \u201cpromotion.\u201d</p><p>So greedy, she thought with a sigh.</p><p>The rock-hard yet smooth mattress underneath her shifted and moaned.</p><p>Wait. Rock-hard? Shifted? Moaned? Jarred into lucidity, Olivia now had no trouble prying her eyelids apart. She jerked upright at the sight she beheld\u2014or didn\u2019t behold. The indigo haze of a rising sun and fat, puffy clouds were nowhere to be seen. Instead, she saw a bedroom with jagged stone walls, a wood floor and polished cherrywood furniture.</p><p>She also saw a lacy pink lounge chair.</p> <p>Realization slammed into her. Fallen. I\u2019ve fallen. She\u2019d descended into hell, and the demons\u2014do not think about them. Already, with only that small memory, her body had begun trembling. I\u2019m with Aeron now. I\u2019m safe. But if she truly was mortal, why did her body feel so...fit?</p><p>Another realization: because she wasn\u2019t truly human.</p><p>Fourteen days, she recalled Lysander saying, before she lost all of her angelic traits. Did that mean... Could her wings have...</p><p>Biting her lower lip, afraid to hope, she reached behind and felt her back. What she encountered caused her shoulders to slump with both relief and sadness. No injuries remained, but her wings had not regrown, either.</p><p>Your choice. Your consequences. Yes. She accepted that. It was strange, though. This wingless body belonged to her. A body that would not live forever. A body that felt both the good and the bad.</p><p>And that was okay, she rushed to assure herself. She was in the Lords\u2019 fortress, and she was with Aeron. Aeron, who was underneath her. How fun. So far this body had only experienced the bad, and she was more than ready for the good.</p><p>Olivia scooted off him and twisted to study him. He was still sleeping, his features relaxed, one arm tossed over his head, the other at his side, where she had been. He\u2019d been holding her close. The corners of her lips lifted in a dreamy smile, and her heart fluttered wildly.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t wearing a T-shirt, and the knowledge caused her heart\u2019s fluttering to pick up speed. She had sprawled across the colorful expanse of his chest, had lain on those tiny brown nipples, those ropes of muscle and that intriguing navel.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was wearing jeans. His feet were bare, though, and she saw that even his toes were tattooed. Adorable.</p><p>Adorable? Really? Who are you? People were being murdered on those toes. Still, she wanted to trace her fingertips over them. She did trace a fingertip over the butterfly on his ribs. The wings curled into sharp points, destroying any illusion of delicacy.</p><p>At her touch, breath pushed from his lips, and she jolted backward. No way did she want to be caught molesting him. Well, without his permission. The action proved more forceful than she\u2019d meant, and she propelled off the bed completely, plummeting to the floor with a painful thwack. Hair danced over her face, and when she brushed the strands aside, she realized she\u2019d awoken Aeron.</p><p>He was sitting up, glaring down at her.</p><p>Olivia gulped and waved up at him shyly. \u201cUh, good morning.\u201d</p><p>His gaze roved over her, narrowed. \u201cYou look better. Much better.\u201d His voice was rough. Probably from sleep, and not desire as every cell in her body hoped. \u201cAre you healed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d At least she thought she was healed. Her heart had yet to calm, its continued erratic beat foreign to her. And there was an ache in her chest. Nothing terrible, as the pain in her back had been, but odd. Her stomach was even quivering.</p><p>\u201cYou suffered for three days. Any complications? Any lingering twinges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days?\u201d She hadn\u2019t realized so much time had passed. And yet, three days hardly seemed long enough for her to have healed so thoroughly. \u201cHow am I all better?\u201d</p><p>He glowered. \u201cWe had a visitor last night. He didn\u2019t give me a name, but he said he would heal you, and I guess he was true to his word. He didn\u2019t like me, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mentor.\u201d Of course. Healing her would have meant bending the rules, but Lysander had helped make those rules. If anyone would know ways around them, it was him. And an angel who didn\u2019t like Aeron? Lysander for sure.</p><p>Once more Aeron\u2019s gaze raked her, as if searching for injuries despite the truth in her claim. His pupils dilated, gobbling up every bit of that lovely violet. Not with happiness, but with...anger? Again? She had done nothing to quash his earlier tenderness. Had Lysander said something to upset him, then?</p><p>\u201cYour robe...\u201d he croaked, and quickly turned away from her, giving her his back. His second butterfly tattoo greeted her, and her mouth watered. What would those jagged wings taste like? \u201cFix it.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she looked down at herself. Her knees were drawn up and her robe was bunched at her waist, revealing the small, white panties she wore. He couldn\u2019t be angry about that. Anya, Lucien\u2019s wife and the minor goddess of Anarchy, wore much less on a daily basis. Still, Olivia smoothed the soft, flowing material to her ankles. She could have stood and rejoined him on the bed but decided not to risk either falling or a rejection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m covered now,\u201d she said.</p><p>When he faced her, those pupils still blown, he tilted his head to the side, as if he were replaying their conversation through his mind. \u201cWhy do you have a mentor?\u201d</p><p>Easy enough to answer. \u201cLike humans, angels must learn how to survive. How to help those in need. How to fight demons. My mentor was\u2014is\u2014the greatest of his kind, and I was blessed to work with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name.\u201d The two words lashed like a whip, hard and sure, cutting.</p><p>Why such a negative reaction? \u201cI believe he\u2019s an acquaintance of yours, actually. You know Lysander, yes?\u201d</p><p>Aeron\u2019s pupils finally retracted, the violet irises once more visible\u2014and drowning her in their irresistible depths. \u201cBianka\u2019s Lysander?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at the description. \u201cYes. He visited me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night I thought you were talking to yourself,\u201d he said, nodding.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And he planned to return. That, she didn\u2019t mention. Lysander loved her and wouldn\u2019t hurt Aeron\u2014yet\u2014because that would, in turn, hurt her. At least, that was the hope she clung to.</p><p>Aeron scowled. \u201cThe angelic visits have to stop, Olivia. Between Hunters and our demons, we have enough to deal with already. Even though Lysander helped you, even though I\u2019m grateful, I cannot allow the continued interference.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She laughed. She just couldn\u2019t help herself. \u201cGood luck with that.\u201d Stopping an angel was like stopping the wind: in a word, impossible.</p><p>His scowl intensified. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>The subject change didn\u2019t bother her; it actually delighted her. He\u2019d often done the same thing with his friends, moving from one topic to another without warning. \u201cOh, yes. I\u2019m starved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll feed you before taking you into town,\u201d he said, throwing his legs over the side of the bed and standing.</p><p>Still Olivia remained in place, but this time the immobility was because her limbs felt as if they were anchored to rocks. First, he was gorgeous. All muscle and danger and mouthwateringly colorful skin. Second\u2014 \u201cYou still mean to cast me out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t you dare cry. \u201cWhy?\u201d Had Lysander said something, as she\u2019d suspected?</p><p>\u201cBetter question. When did I ever imply otherwise?\u201d He strode to his bathroom and she lost sight of him. There was a rustle of clothing, and then a burst of water upon porcelain.</p> <p>\u201cBut you held me in your arms all night,\u201d she called. \u201cYou cared for me for three days.\u201d That had to mean something. Right? Men didn\u2019t do such things unless they were besotted. Right? In all her time with Aeron, she\u2019d never seen him with a female. Well, besides Legion, but the little demon didn\u2019t count. He\u2019d never held her in his arms all night. So his attention to Olivia was special. Right?</p><p>There was no reply. Soon, steam and the scent of sandalwood soap were drifting through the room. He was showering, she realized, and her heart once more picked up speed, even skipping a beat altogether. He\u2019d never showered when she\u2019d been here before. He\u2019d always waited until she had left.</p><p>Seeing his naked body had become an obsession.</p><p>Was he tattooed there, between his legs? If so, what design had he chosen?</p><p>And why do I want to lick that design the same way I want to lick the butterflies? Imagining doing so, Olivia traced her tongue over her lips before freezing in astonishment. Bad, naughty girl. Such a desire...</p><p>Well, I\u2019m not fully an angel anymore, she reminded herself, and she wanted to see\u2014and taste\u2014him. So see him\u2014and hopefully taste him\u2014she would. After everything she\u2019d endured, she deserved a little treat. Or maybe a big treat? Either way, she wasn\u2019t leaving this fortress until she\u2019d gotten a peek.</p> <p>Determined, Olivia finally pushed to her feet. Without her wings to center her, she had no sense of balance, and quickly toppled over, sharp pains exploding from her knees and making her wince. This pain, however, was bearable. After the wing extraction, everything was probably bearable.</p><p>Again, she stood. Again she fell. Argh! All too soon, the water shut off. There was a slap of wet flesh against marble, and then a glide of cotton from metal.</p><p>Hurry! Before it was too late.</p><p>For balance, she placed one foot in front and one in back and spread her arms wide. Slowly she inched to her full height. She wobbled left, then right, but managed to stay upright this time. Go, me!</p><p>Then Aeron emerged from the bathroom, and disappointment filled her. There was a towel wrapped around his waist and another winding around his neck. Too late. Double argh!</p><p>\u201cYou showered so swiftly. Surely you missed a spot,\u201d she said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t flick her a glance, but kept his attention on the dresser in front of him. \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p> <p>\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn,\u201d he said after placing a T-shirt on top of the wood. He used the second towel to dry what little hair he had.</p><p>Had she called him gorgeous before? She should have said magnificent. \u201cMy robe cleans me.\u201d Did she sound as breathless to him as she did to herself?</p><p>He frowned, still not facing her. \u201cEven your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her hands were shaking as she pulled the hood over her head, gave it time to work its magic, and then cast it back. As the material fell, she smoothed a hand through her now silky, smooth locks. \u201cSee? All of me.\u201d</p><p>Finally, he looked her over, gaze sliding down her body, lingering in certain places, heating her blood, making her skin tingle. When their eyes met, his pupils were once again dilated, black overshadowing violet.</p><p>Seriously, what was she doing to cause such anger?</p><p>\u201cThat it does,\u201d he growled. He turned on his heel and strode forward, entering his closet and disappearing from view. The towel soared out and landed in a heap on the floor.</p><p>He was naked again, she thought, forgetting his anger. Now\u2019s your chance. Grinning, Olivia propelled into motion. She managed two steps before toppling and landing on her knees\u2014then launching the rest of the way to her stomach, air whooshing from her lungs.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Up, up she looked. There was Aeron, in the closet doorway, dressed in that black T-shirt, now paired with jeans. He\u2019d also pulled on a pair of boots and weapons were probably strapped all over his muscled body. His eyes were narrowed, his lips drawn tight in a frown.</p><p>Foiled again. She sighed in dejection.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, really,\u201d he said, clearly done waiting for her reply. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to go.\u201d</p><p>Now? \u201cYou can\u2019t take me into town,\u201d she rushed out. \u201cYou need me.\u201d</p><p>He sputtered for a moment. \u201cHardly. I need no one.\u201d</p><p>Oh, really? \u201cSomeone else will be sent to do the job I couldn\u2019t do, remember? As you couldn\u2019t sense Lysander when he visited me, you won\u2019t be able to sense another angel.\u201d</p><p>Aeron crossed his arms over his massive chest, the very picture of male stubbornness. \u201cI sensed you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Yes, he had, and she still hadn\u2019t figured out how he\u2019d done so. \u201cWell, like I said, you didn\u2019t sense Lysander. I, however, can see the angels. I can warn you when another approaches.\u201d Not that they would come for him until her fourteen-day reprieve ended\u2014wait, they had an eleven-day reprieve now, since three had already passed\u2014but he didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>He popped his jaw left and right, disrupting the flow of the images etched there. \u201cYou told me you were hungry. Let\u2019s find you something to eat.\u201d</p><p>Again with the subject change. This time, she hated it, but still let it slide, sensing further argument was futile. Besides, she was hungry. She crawled to her knees, then eased to her feet. One step, two...three...Soon she was in front of Aeron, smiling at her success.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWalking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook you so long, I\u2019m officially fifty years older.\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin, pride undiminished. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t fall.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head\u2014in exasperation?\u2014and took her hand in his. \u201cCome on, angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFallen,\u201d she automatically corrected. The feel of his fingers curled around hers, warm and strong, made her shiver. A sensation she wasn\u2019t allowed to relish.</p><p>When he tugged her forward, she tripped over her own feet. Thankfully, before she could kiss the ground again, he jerked her up and into his side, anchoring her there.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Now this was the life. She snuggled as close to him as she could get. Throughout the centuries, she\u2019d watched many humans succumb to their baser desires, but until that golden down had appeared in her wings, she hadn\u2019t truly wondered why they did so. Now she knew: every touch was as delicious as Eve\u2019s apple had probably been.</p><p>She wanted more.</p><p>\u201cYou are a menace,\u201d Aeron mumbled.</p><p>\u201cA helpful menace.\u201d Maybe, if she reminded him enough, he would begin to realize that he did, in fact, need her.</p><p>He didn\u2019t offer a response, but led her down a hallway, keeping her upright the entire time. Even better, he had to carry her down the flight of stairs. Something she would have enjoyed far more if she hadn\u2019t been so distracted. The walls were lined with portraits of the heavens\u2014angels she recognized flying through the clouds\u2014as well as hell. The latter she avoided studying, not wanting any reminders of her time there.</p><p>Also lining the walls were pictures of naked men, most lounging on beds of silk. Those she stared at, a fact that didn\u2019t embarrass her. Really. Even when she had to mop up her drool. All that skin...that brawn...that sinew... Too bad they weren\u2019t tattooed from head to toe.</p><p>\u201cAnya\u2019s been doing some decorating. You should cover your eyes,\u201d Aeron said, his deep voice cutting into her ogling.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Covering her eyes would be a crime. One that would surely insult her Deity, for wasn\u2019t it her duty to admire his creations?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an angel, for gods\u2019 sake. You aren\u2019t supposed to look at such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fallen,\u201d she reminded him. Again. \u201cAnd how do you know what I\u2019m supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...close your eyes.\u201d He dropped her legs, forcing her to stand, and ushered her around a corner.</p><p>A bevy of voices suddenly assaulted her ears, and she stiffened, stumbled, unprepared to deal with anyone but Aeron.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d he said.</p><p>She slowed her steps. People were unpredictable, and his immortal friends more than most. Worse, her body was now susceptible to all forms of injury. They could torture her, physically, mentally and emotionally, and she wouldn\u2019t be able to fly away.</p><p>In the heavens, everyone loved everyone else. There was no hate, no cruelty. Here, kindness was often an afterthought. Humans often called each other terrible names, tore down each other\u2019s self-esteem and purposely broke one another\u2019s pride.</p><p>Olivia would have been happiest spending every minute of her humanity alone with Aeron.</p><p>You weighed the good versus the bad, remember? You thought the possibility of pleasure worth any price. You can deal. You have to.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She was determined.</p><p>They rounded another corner, entering the dining room, and Aeron stopped. Immediately, the voices tapered to quiet. Olivia did a quick scan and saw that four individuals sat at a table piled high with food. Four potential torturers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Fear sparked inside her chest, and she had trouble catching her breath. Before she realized what she was doing, she had pulled from Aeron\u2019s clasp and inched behind him, hiding from view. To remain upright, she had to flatten her palms against his back.</p><p>\u201cFinally. Fresh angel meat,\u201d a woman said with a husky laugh. \u201cWe were beginning to think Aeron planned to keep you hidden forever. Not that I would\u2019ve allowed such a thing, you understand. I\u2019d already dug out my trusty lock pick and had a rendezvous scheduled for midnight.\u201d</p><p>A nice-to-meet-you rendezvous or a how-does-the-tip-of-my-blade-feel rendezvous? Probably the latter. Olivia recognized the raspy voice as that of Kaia Skyhawk, Bianka\u2019s twin and Gwen\u2019s big sister. She was a stealing, lying Harpy, and the spawn of Lucifer. She was also aiding the Lords in their quest to find Pandora\u2019s box, and would destroy anything she viewed as a threat. Like an angel.</p> <p>Gwen, the youngest Skyhawk, lived here with Sabin, though the pair was currently in Rome, last Olivia had heard, along with several others, searching one of the Titans\u2019 newly risen temples for artifacts that had once belonged to Cronus.</p><p>Silly Cronus, whom the Lords assumed was all-powerful. If they only knew...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d keep my mouth shut if I were you,\u201d the one called Paris warned the Harpy.</p><p>Olivia peeked around Aeron\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Kaia asked, unconcerned. \u201cYou think Aeron will attack me? You should know by now that I like to wrestle. In oil.\u201d</p> <p>Paris\u2019s lips pursed at the unpleasant reminder of his own oil-wrestling experience. With Lysander. Something Olivia would have loved to watch. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you should be quiet because of Aeron. I think you should be quiet because you\u2019re prettier that way.\u201d</p><p>There was a feminine snort, and Olivia smiled in response. No longer drunk with pain and memories, she found, to her surprise, that her fear of the demons was fading. Maybe she really could do this.</p><p>\u201cSo, Olivia,\u201d Paris said. \u201cHow are you? Feeling better?\u201d</p><p>Though she didn\u2019t move from behind Aeron, she replied, \u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. I\u2019d love to give you something to be really thankful for.\u201d This speaker was William, she realized. He was handsome, wickedly so, with black hair and blue eyes. He was also an untamable rogue with an odd sense of humor Olivia didn\u2019t always understand.</p><p>\u201cSomeone needs to remove your something for the good of womankind.\u201d That pronouncement came from Cameo, the only female Lord. Well, the only one the Lords knew about. She was possessed by Misery, and all the world\u2019s sorrows rested in her voice.</p> <p>Just then, Olivia wanted to give the woman a hug. No one here knew it, but Cameo always fell asleep crying. It was heartbreaking. Maybe...maybe they could become friends now, she thought, again surprised by her still-fading fear.</p><p>\u201cNow that that\u2019s out of the way,\u201d Aeron said, once again taking Olivia\u2019s hand and dragging her with him as he marched forward. When he reached the table, he pulled out a chair for her.</p><p>She kept her eyes downcast as she shook her head. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sit alone.\u201d Not after she\u2019d experienced the bliss of having him as her mattress and then her cane.</p><p>Sighing, he plopped into the chair himself. Fighting a triumphant grin, Olivia perched herself on his lap. Well, she fell into his lap. No longer able to use him as a cane, she\u2019d had no anchor to steady her. He stiffened, but didn\u2019t rebuke her.</p><p>She had no idea what everyone thought of her display because she kept her gaze downcast. For the moment, she was calm and she wanted to stay that way.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s everyone else?\u201d Aeron asked, picking up the conversation as if it had never tapered off.</p> <p>\u201cLucien and Anya are in town, still looking for your Shadow Girl,\u201d Paris replied. \u201cTorin\u2019s in his bedroom, of course, watching the world and keeping us safe. Danika\u2014\u201d Aeron flinched at the girl\u2019s name, and Olivia patted his hand in comfort. Clearly, he still felt guilty for almost killing her. \u201cDanika is painting something, but she won\u2019t tell us what yet, and Ashlyn is looking over the scrolls Cronus gave us, trying to remember if she ever heard a conversation about any of the people listed.\u201d</p><p>The scrolls in question documented nearly everyone who had been possessed by one of the demons released from Pandora\u2019s box, Olivia knew. Angels had kept watch over them throughout the centuries, so she knew where a few lived. Would she be marked for death by her own kind if she told? Would that break an ancient law?</p><p>\u201cGods, Sex. We should rename you Boring. Let\u2019s get to the good stuff. Introductions are in order, yes?\u201d William prompted. \u201cIt\u2019s only polite, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when do you care about politeness?\u201d Aeron barked.</p><p>\u201cSince now.\u201d</p><p>Behind her, she heard her warrior\u2019s teeth grind. \u201cThis is Olivia. She\u2019s an angel,\u201d he said to no one in particular. His harsh tone didn\u2019t invite further conversation.</p><p>\u201cFallen angel,\u201d she corrected anyway. She spied a bowl of grapes and couldn\u2019t stop her squeal of delight. Three days of neglect caught up with her.</p><p>Sharing and moderation, creeds she had lived by all her life, abandoned her as she grabbed the bowl and pressed it into her chest. One by one (handful), she popped the delicious fruit into her mouth, savoring, moaning her satisfaction. But all too soon, the bowl was empty and she frowned\u2014until she spied a plate of apple slices.</p><p>\u201cYummy.\u201d Olivia leaned forward. She would have tipped to the side, but Aeron\u2019s big hands settled on her hips, securing her in place and making her shiver. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Grinning, she swiped up the plate and settled back in his lap. He tensed as she did so, and poked her in the lower back, but she barely noticed. The slices, too, were consumed amid happy moans. Food tasted even better as a human. Sweeter. Necessary rather than an afterthought.</p><p>Finally full, she glanced up to offer someone the last remaining slice. Everyone was staring at her, and the food settled like lead inside her stomach. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said automatically. What had she done wrong?</p><p>\u201cWhy are you apologizing?\u201d Kaia asked. There was nothing malicious in her tone, only genuine curiosity.</p><p>\u201cEveryone is watching me, so I thought...\u201d More than that, Aeron was tenser than before.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with the Harpy,\u201d William added, wiggling his eyebrows. \u201cI love a woman who molests her breakfast.\u201d</p><p>She had not done that. Had she?</p><p>Kaia slapped the back of his head. \u201cShut it, playboy. No one cares about your opinions.\u201d To Olivia, she said, \u201cIn case you had trouble grasping my meaning, I\u2019m staring at you because I\u2019m curious about you.\u201d</p><p>Just as Olivia was curious about her, she realized. The Harpies could only eat what they stole, lied unabashedly and killed with abandon. In short, they were the antithesis of the angels, yet they enjoyed life to its fullest, which was why Lysander had chosen to be with one.</p><p>Soon, I will enjoy life to the fullest, as well.</p><p>\u201cDo you know Lysander, my twin sister\u2019s man?\u201d Kaia asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Very well.\u201d</p><p>The Harpy propped her elbows on the table, rattling dishes. \u201cIs he as ironfisted as I think?\u201d Disgust layered her voice.</p><p>\u201cProbably more so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it! Poor B.\u201d Sympathy darkened her features, but she quickly brightened. \u201cI know. You and I can put our heads together, because two gorgeous heads are always better than one, and plan ways to loosen him up a bit. We can even get to know each other better. The girls of the house have to stick together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot possible. I\u2019m taking Olivia into town.\u201d Aeron\u2019s hold, which had never fallen away, tightened further. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no planning. No loosening up. Definitely no getting to know each other.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s shoulders slumped. Had Aeron always been so harsh and she just hadn\u2019t noticed? Or was this attitude for her benefit? \u201cAre you sure you want to get rid of me?\u201d she asked him. \u201cI\u2019m good for you. I promise!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can help me?\u201d A question when it should have been a statement.</p><p>She wanted to shake him, the stubborn man. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019ve got enough helpers here, so, yes, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can also make you smile. That was my job, you know.\u201d Her old job, anyway, and one she missed. \u201cWould you like to smile?\u201d</p><p>He offered no hesitation. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d William clapped. \u201cI like to smile when I\u2019m in bed and naked, so I say we keep her.\u201d</p><p>Aeron\u2019s nails dug past her robe and into skin, but she didn\u2019t protest. If she did, he would remove his hands, and she liked them where they were. \u201cLike Kaia said, your opinion doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Kaia added. \u201cI doubt the big guy even knows how to smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d Aeron snapped, causing everyone to laugh.</p><p>\u201cSure you do, Grumpy.\u201d Kaia tossed her bright red hair over her shoulder. \u201cListen, there\u2019s no need for you to take her into town. News flash\u2014I\u2019m taking myself up on my offer and getting to know her. I\u2019m totally impressed by the fact that she got herself booted from the heavens, and I need all the juicy details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs will I.\u201d Cameo nodded to emphasize her determination. \u201cBe getting to know her, that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can include me, too.\u201d William blew Olivia a kiss, and her cheeks heated with a blush. \u201cNo need to say anything. I already know what words are perched on your tongue. Stop me if I\u2019m wrong, but my getting to know you will be your pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Aeron growled low in his throat. \u201cShe\u2019s not staying, and there will be no pleasure. As I said, I am taking her into town and leaving her there. Today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Olivia asked. She might have hated her duties as a warrior angel and might not have ever made a kill, but that didn\u2019t mean she was a complete pushover. \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t want any more helpers, but I promise you, those you have can\u2019t help you with the next angel sent to kill you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She expected someone to speak up and agree with her, but no one seemed to care that a heavenly assassin would be coming to snuff out their friend. Everyone at the table, including Aeron, probably assumed the Lord was invincible.</p><p>So of course, he remained stubborn. \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>She slapped the apple plate back where she\u2019d found it, rattling the dishes far more than Kaia had. \u201cI can also help you defeat the Hunters.\u201d Truth.</p> <p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d he said, and she didn\u2019t have to see him to know he was gazing up at the ceiling and praying for patience. Except, if she wasn\u2019t mistaken, the prayer she actually heard him mutter was for strength. \u201cWe are demons, and demons and angels do not mix. Besides, Legion can\u2019t return until you\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>The one argument she couldn\u2019t refute absolutely. \u201cBut...but...I\u2019m willing to try to get along with her.\u201d If he heard her panic, he gave no indication. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be nice to all your other friends, too. How could I not? I gave up everything to save you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The words were snarled.</p><p>\u201cThe least you can do is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to give up anything,\u201d he snapped. \u201cSo, no. There is no least I can do. You\u2019re healed. We\u2019re even. I owe you nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Cameo ignored him, propped her elbows on the table and leaned forward, closer to Olivia. \u201cForget about him. He just hasn\u2019t had enough caffeine yet. Let\u2019s backtrack a bit. How can you help us with the Hunters?\u201d</p><p>Finally. Interest, even if Cameo\u2019s tone was more morose than encouraging. Olivia raised her chin another notch. \u201cFor one thing, I know where other demon-possessed immortals are located.\u201d Thankfully, lightning didn\u2019t strike her at the confession, and angels didn\u2019t appear with fiery swords raised. \u201cYou said you were looking for them, I believe.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed in shocked silence, all eyes hitting\u2014and staying on\u2014her.</p><p>\u201cAeron,\u201d Cameo said.</p><p>\u201cNo. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d his hard voice proclaimed. \u201cWe have the scrolls for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but they give names, not locations.\u201d The female Lord\u2019s stare became penetrating. \u201cSabin will want to talk with her when he returns.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that dickwad Sabin wants to talk to her, that means Gwennie will want to, as well.\u201d Kaia drummed her nails against the tabletop. \u201cAnd as you know, puppy, I ensure that my sister gets what she wants. Besides, I\u2019m about to die of boredom since no one has attacked the fortress as promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarpy,\u201d Aeron snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t try my patience. You will obey me in this and let the angel go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarriors are so adorable when they think they\u2019re all tough and commanding.\u201d Kaia\u2019s arm shot out, again rattling dishes, and she snatched up a handful of eggs. A handful she then launched at Aeron.</p><p>Olivia quickly dodged, and the eggs slapped Aeron in the face. His lips curled in a grimace as he wiped away the yellow mess. Rather than touch her again, however, he flattened his palms on the arms of the chair.</p><p>Kaia giggled like a schoolgirl. \u201cDon\u2019t act surprised by our insistence that she remain here. Paris told me what you said to Cronus the other night on that rooftop. \u2018Send me a woman who will deny me,\u2019\u201d she mocked.</p><p>\u201cOh, really? When did you and Paris have time for a heart-to-heart?\u201d William asked as he buttered a blueberry muffin.</p><p>Kaia shrugged, her focus remaining on Aeron. \u201cA couple nights ago, I was looking for a little fun, and he was looking a little weak.\u201d Another shrug. \u201cHe was feeling chatty afterward.\u201d</p> <p>Paris merely nodded in confirmation. Every time Olivia had seen the keeper of Promiscuity, he\u2019d appeared sad. Just then, he looked almost...happy, if a little tired. That must have been some chat.</p><p>\u201cBut I offered you a place in my bed,\u201d William whined to the Harpy.</p><p>Bed? Oh. Oh. Kaia and Paris had apparently accomplished more than talking during that heart-to-heart.</p><p>\u201cYou suck at \u2018Guitar Hero,\u2019 so I figure you\u2019re bad with your hands. Besides, someone else we all know and love has staked prior claim on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Olivia asked before she could stop herself.</p><p>Kaia ignored her, continuing on. \u201cTherefore, I picked Paris to keep me warm the other night. And I can\u2019t wait to give Bianka the down-and-dirty details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. No, no, no. You can\u2019t kiss and tell,\u201d Paris sputtered.</p><p>The Harpy smiled lazily, evilly. \u201cJust watch me. Any-hoodles. You want your little demon to return, Aeron-bo-barren, you\u2019ll have to go into town and play with her there. The angel stays.\u201d</p><p>The heat of Aeron\u2019s breath was like fire on the back of Olivia\u2019s neck. \u201cThis. Is. My. Home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>Kaia and William had spoken in unison. They shared a smile, though William still looked sulky over Kaia\u2019s choice of bedmates.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Olivia said, chin lifting yet another notch. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d She wanted Aeron here with her, yes, but he apparently needed time away to reflect on how lucky he actually was to have her.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t egotistical of her, she told herself. Truth was never egotistical. Besides, it shouldn\u2019t take him more than a few hours to realize just how much he needed her and wanted to be with her. He was smart. For the most part.</p><p>Please, let him want to be with me.</p><p>Once more Aeron\u2019s hands settled on her waist. This time, he squeezed hard enough to make her gasp. \u201cDo you know where Pandora\u2019s box is, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>Of course he\u2019d ask the one question she didn\u2019t have an answer for. \u201cWell...uh...no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where the Cloak of Invisibility and the Paring Rod are being held?\u201d</p><p>Okay. Two questions. \u201cNo,\u201d she admitted softly. What she did know was that the Lords had found two of Cronus\u2019s artifacts: the Cage of Compulsion and the All-Seeing Eye. What they lacked, as Aeron had mentioned, was the Cloak of Invisibility and the Paring Rod. As the One True Deity had no use for such relics, her kind had never searched for them.</p><p>Aeron lifted her to her feet and released her. Olivia had to grip the table to keep from toppling over. She also had to press her lips together to keep from moaning in disappointment. Touch me.</p><p>\u201cStill want her here?\u201d he asked the others, emotionless. \u201cHer, rather than me?\u201d</p><p>One by one, they nodded. Unrepentant.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cShe\u2019s yours. Get what information you can from her. As suggested, I\u2019ll be in town. Someone text me when she\u2019s gone. Only then will I return.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY to drive him mad, Aeron thought darkly.</p><p>First, his friends had kicked him out. Second, his demon had screamed at him to stay. To stay. With Olivia. A being Wrath should despise. A being Aeron should despise. Instead, he understood his demon\u2019s dilemma.She was enchanting.</p><p>This morning, when he\u2019d woken up and realized she was fully healed, the desire he\u2019d denied only a few days ago had sparked to life. Ever since, it had refused to fade. She\u2019d fallen to the floor, robe bunched at her waist, and her panties\u2014shit, her panties. Too white, too pure. Made a man want to rip them apart with his teeth and dirty the wearer up a bit. He\u2019d wanted to tear her robe away, too, and devour her.</p><p>Somehow, some way, he\u2019d managed to stop himself.</p><p>Maybe because he\u2019d realized\u2014and reminded himself, over and over again\u2014that Lysander had been the voice he\u2019d heard the day before. That Lysander had been the one to heal Olivia, the one who wanted her happy and whole.</p><p>\u201cUnsoiled,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>And Lysander would be a terrible enemy to have.</p><p>The Lords could fight Hunters, yes. But Hunters and an angelic army? Hardly.</p><p>So Aeron had finally gotten himself under enough control to leave the bed without falling on top of Olivia in a desperate rush to touch and taste her. He\u2019d finally convinced himself to get rid of her. He\u2019d finally, blessedly forgotten there was a throbbing erection between his legs while she wiggled on his lap and made love to her food.</p><p>Only to have Wrath insist on \u201cmore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked you better when you were merely a presence. An urge,\u201d he told the demon now.</p><p>A snort was the only reply. At least there was no more of the demon\u2019s pleading. Wrath had only quieted a few minutes ago, when realizing what Aeron planned.</p><p>Aeron scrubbed his face so hard his calluses scratched his cheeks. He was in Gilly\u2019s apartment in town. A spacious three-bedroom on the wealthier side. Gilly was a young friend of Danika\u2019s who now lived in Budapest. Torin, their first line of defense at the fortress, had loaded her apartment with state-of-the-art security, just in case Hunters ever discovered her connection to the Lords. Even though she was fully human and as innocent as a person could be\u2014a miracle in and of itself, given what Danika had told the Lords about Gilly\u2019s troubled childhood\u2014those bastards wouldn\u2019t hesitate to hurt her.</p><p>She was currently at school\u2014high school, that is\u2014and undoubtedly happy for the distance between them. She still wasn\u2019t comfortable around him. Understandable. Though Gilly was only seventeen, she\u2019d seen the dark side of man and had been on her own for years. They\u2019d offered her a room at the fortress, but she\u2019d desired a place of her own. Good thing, too. Now Aeron wouldn\u2019t have to roam aimlessly until dark; he could summon Legion at last.</p><p>He stood in the center of the living room, the couches and chairs pushed back to make space for the circle of salt and sugar he\u2019d sprinkled just in front of him. He was going to summon her in a way she couldn\u2019t ignore.</p><p>He splayed his arms and said, \u201cLegion, Quinientos Diecis\u00e9is of the Crois\u00e9 Sombres of Neid and Notpehocil,\u201d just as Legion had taught him. It was her name, number, and title in a mix of different languages. Legion, Number Five Hundred and Sixteen of the Dark Crusaders of Envy and Need. If he didn\u2019t say it all, he could accidentally summon someone else. \u201cI command you to appear before me. Now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was no flashing light as Cronus liked to employ when materializing, nor did time stop. One minute Aeron was alone, the next Legion was inside the circle. Simple, easy.</p><p>She collapsed to the floor, panting, sweat glistening on her scales.</p><p>\u201cLegion.\u201d He bent down and scooped her up, careful not to let a single grain of salt or sugar touch her. It would burn, she\u2019d told him.</p> <p>Wrath purred, happy again.</p><p>Immediately Legion snuggled into his arms. \u201cAeron. My Aeron.\u201d</p><p>The action reminded him of Olivia. Sweet, beautiful Olivia, who was now with Kaia, a demented Harpy with a warped sense of humor, and Cameo, a ruthless killer with a tragic voice. He\u2019d leave William and Paris, two unabashed sex addicts, out of the equation. Because if he didn\u2019t, he would destroy Gilly\u2019s apartment in a fit of rage. Rage, not jealousy, just to be clear. If they messed with the angel, they\u2019d be inviting Lysander\u2019s wrath\u2014and it was that prospect, not the thought of Olivia being attracted to one of his friends, that infuriated him. Of course.</p><p>Gilly\u2019s wall would look better with a few holes, he thought then. He\u2019d be doing the girl a favor, helping her decorate.</p><p>Plus, as leery as Olivia was with others\u2014anyone but himself, that was, not that he was proud about that\u2014she might not be faring well. Even now she could be hiding, crying, praying for his return.</p> <p>Surely Gilly\u2019s couch would be more comfortable if it were sawed in two.</p><p>Harden your heart, as you so unflinchingly told Paris you could do. Olivia\u2019s state of mind didn\u2019t matter. Her tears didn\u2019t matter. They couldn\u2019t. Actually, they would help. She would leave the fortress that much faster.</p><p>Legion was the most important thing to him. The child he\u2019d secretly wanted but had never been able to have. Not just because he\u2019d never committed to a woman, but because he knew how weak babies could be. Becoming a father, something he\u2019d never had himself, hadn\u2019t been worth the agony of watching his own child wither and die.</p><p>With Legion, he didn\u2019t have to worry. She would live forever.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, precious girl?\u201d he asked, carrying her to the couch and falling into its cushions. The scent of sulfur clung to her, and Wrath sighed, clearly homesick. Once his demon had hated that aroma. But now that the fiend knew the horrors of Pandora\u2019s box, hell seemed like Paradise.</p><p>\u201cThey chassse me.\u201d She rubbed her cheek against his pectoral, abrading skin, and purred. \u201cAlmost got me thisss time.\u201d</p> <p>Her forked tongue always caught on and prolonged her S\u2019s, something he found endearing. When he\u2019d first met her, she\u2019d even spoken like a baby, using the wrong tenses and pronouns. At her request, they\u2019d been working on her grammar, and he was very proud of her progress.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here now. You\u2019re safe.\u201d He rubbed the two little horns atop her head, knowing how sensitive they were and how much she liked it. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngel dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d he said, sidestepping the question for the moment.</p><p>They sat like that, silent, for several minutes, while she fought for control of her breathing. Finally, she calmed and the burning heat of her scales cooled. She sat up and that red gaze looked around.</p><p>\u201cThisss isssn\u2019t home,\u201d she said, confused.</p><p>Aeron scanned their surroundings, trying to see the place as she must. Furniture in a rainbow of colors: red, blue, green, purple and pink. A wood floor draped with a floral-print rug. Walls dripping with different-sized portraits of the heavens, gifts from Danika.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in Gilly\u2019s apartment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPretty,\u201d she said, the awe in her voice unmistakable.</p><p>Her sense of femininity had ceased surprising him. When he moved back to the fortress, he would give her a room of her own. A room she could decorate as she wished. He wasn\u2019t sure how much more pink he could stand in his own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it. We might be here awhile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her awe was replaced by fury as she faced him. \u201cYou\u2019re living with Gilly now? Isss ssshe... Doesss ssshe love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she relaxed. \u201cOkay, then, but I wanna go home now. I missss it.\u201d</p><p>Me, too. \u201cWe can\u2019t. The angel is there.\u201d</p><p>Legion stiffened, fury returning. \u201cWhy isss ssshe there and not usss?\u201d</p><p>Excellent question. \u201cShe\u2019s going to help the others with the Hunters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No. I help with Huntersss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d She might be little, but she was fierce. And killing was a game to her. But she\u2019d endured so much strife in her life that Aeron desired only peace for her now. He didn\u2019t want to drag her into yet another battle. He wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>She meant too much to him.</p><p>\u201cWe can be alone here,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Again, she relaxed against him. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay, but I will help more than her.\u201d</p><p>Or Olivia would lose her head. Warning received. Time to distract his little darling. \u201cWant to play a game?\u201d</p><p>Jumping up, grinning, she wound herself around his neck, slithering like a snake. \u201cYesss, yesss, yesss.\u201d</p><p>Always ready to play, his Legion. Despite her improved speech, she hadn\u2019t lost her childlike needs. \u201cPick something. Whatever you want.\u201d He reached up to pet her, and his gaze fell to his arm. There was a single patch of bare skin on his wrist. He should have a snake tattooed there, to remind him of Legion. A tattoo to remind him of the good in his life, rather than the bad.</p><p>Yes, he liked that idea.</p><p>\u201cI want to play...Clothes Optional.\u201d</p><p>Also known as Shred Everything Aeron Wore. \u201cMaybe pick something else. What about Beauty Shop, like we played a week ago? You can paint my nails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d Legion clapped, her excitement palpable. \u201cI\u2019ll go get Gilly\u2019ssss polisssh.\u201d Off she raced, disappearing around the corner.</p><p>\u201cGilly\u2019s room is the last one on the right,\u201d he called. He would spend an hour or two indulging her and then he would patrol the city for any sign of Hunters, as well as Shadow Girl. After what Legion had endured in hell, he owed her a little recreation, damn his duties.</p><p>Owed. The single word blasted through his head, and he cursed. He also owed Paris.</p><p>Even though he\u2019d claimed he wouldn\u2019t return to the fortress until Olivia was gone, he had to take care of Paris. That wasn\u2019t a duty he would relinquish for any reason, yet he\u2019d already allowed Lucien to see to Paris\u2019s needs for the last three days. He sighed, disappointed in himself. Just because Lucien had taken the warrior into town didn\u2019t mean Paris had picked anyone.</p><p>And while Paris might have slept with Kaia the other night, the strength he\u2019d derived from it wouldn\u2019t last long. Despite his smiles, he\u2019d looked fatigued at breakfast. As Aeron had learned, fatigue was the first sign of trouble.</p><p>Aeron was willing to bet the warrior hadn\u2019t been with anyone since Kaia. And that just wouldn\u2019t do.</p><p>Legion skipped back into the living room, holding a plastic purple case and grinning widely. \u201cYour nails will look like rainbowsss when I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>Rainbow. He supposed that was better than the bright pink flares she\u2019d made them last time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby, but our game will have to wait. I need to go back to the fortress and take care of something, which means I need you to stay here.\u201d</p><p>The case fell to the floor with a crash. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be gone long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You ssssumoned me. You sssaid you\u2019d play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if Gilly returns before I do,\u201d he continued, as if she hadn\u2019t spoken, \u201cplease, please, please don\u2019t try and play with her. All right?\u201d The human wouldn\u2019t survive. \u201cI just have to grab something.\u201d Or rather, someone. \u201cBe a good girl and wait for me.\u201d</p><p>Legion stalked to him. She flattened her hands on his chest, her claws slicing past his skin, drawing beads of blood. \u201cI\u2019ll go, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t, baby. Remember?\u201d He reached up and scratched her behind the ears. \u201cThe angel is there. She\u2019s lost her wings and is now visible, but that doesn\u2019t make her any less dangerous to you. She\u2014\u201d</p><p>The little demon jumped up and perched in his lap, staring up at him. Already big eyes widened. \u201cSsshe doesssn\u2019t have wingsss no more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsshe\u2019sss fallen, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Once again, Legion clapped happily. \u201cI heard an angel had fallen, but I didn\u2019t know it wasss her. I could have helped them hurt her! But I can fix that. I can snatch my home from her now. I can kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, more fiercely than he\u2019d intended.</p><p>Even Wrath reacted fiercely, growling inside his head, snapping at Legion for the first time.</p><p>Because his demon wanted to be the one to destroy the angel? No. Aeron shook his head. That made no sense, considering Wrath\u2019s earlier desire for \u201cmore.\u201d Perhaps the demon didn\u2019t want her destroyed by anyone. A suspicion that still made no sense, but was a better fit.</p><p>Why did the demon like her?</p><p>Later. Aeron cupped Legion\u2019s chin and forced her to keep her attention on him so that he would know she was not already daydreaming about the killing. \u201cFocus on me, baby. Good. Now. You can\u2019t hurt the angel.\u201d</p><p>Legion blinked up at him. \u201cI can! I\u2019m ssstrong enough, I promissse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you can, but I don\u2019t want you to. She was supposed to hurt me but didn\u2019t.\u201d Instead, she\u2019d given up everything for him.</p><p>Why? he wondered for the thousandth time. What kind of person did that? He\u2019d scoffed at her earlier when she\u2019d reminded him of her sacrifice, but truly, he was fascinated and confused. And humbled.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know him. Or maybe she did, since she\u2019d followed him for weeks\u2014but that made her decision all the more bizarre. More than that, he wasn\u2019t worth saving. Not to an angel, all that was good and right and perfect. And certainly not to a woman whom he would never allow himself to have. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSsso?\u201d Legion persisted.</p><p>\u201cSo. In return, we\u2019re going to be nice to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! No, no, no.\u201d If she\u2019d been standing, she would have been stomping her feet. \u201cI can hurt her if I want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLegion,\u201d he said, using his most authoritative tone. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a negotiation. You will leave her alone. Promise me.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, she sprang from his lap and paced the length of carpet in front of him. \u201cYou only want me to be nice to your friendsss. Ssso ssshe hasss to be your friend. But you can\u2019t be friendsss with a disssgusssting angel.\u201d</p><p>The words didn\u2019t seem to be directed at him, so he didn\u2019t reply. He let her continue to rant, hopefully getting it out of her system.</p><p>\u201cIsss ssshe pretty? I bet ssshe\u2019sss pretty.\u201d</p><p>Again, Aeron remained silent. Legion, he knew, was protective of him and liked to be the center of his world. As was not uncommon among children of single fathers, she didn\u2019t like him turning his attentions elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cYou like her,\u201d she accused.</p><p>Finally he spoke up. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t.\u201d But even he could detect the uncertainty in his voice. He\u2019d liked holding Olivia in his arms the last few nights. Liked it way too much. He\u2019d liked her sitting in his lap at breakfast. He\u2019d liked having her wild-sky scent in his nose. He\u2019d liked the softness of her skin and the purity of her eyes. He\u2019d liked her gentleness and her determination.</p><p>He\u2019d liked the way she\u2019d looked at him, as if he were part savior, part temptation.</p><p>\u201cYou like her,\u201d Legion repeated, and this time there was so much fury in her words, they nearly scorched his skin.</p><p>\u201cLegion,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if I like another woman, that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll love you any less. You are my baby, and that will never change.\u201d</p><p>Poison dripped from her too-sharp teeth\u2014teeth she bared in a snarl. \u201cI\u2019m not a baby! And you can\u2019t like her. You jussst can\u2019t. I\u2019ll kill her. I\u2019ll kill her right now!\u201d With that, Legion disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cWHAT DO YOU THINK?\u201d</p><p>Olivia twirled clumsily in front of the full-length mirror, taking in the knee-high black boots, the so-short-it-barely-covered-her-bottom skirt and the cerulean-blue tank top she wore. The matching blue thong she had shimmied into even came up over the waist of the skirt. Talk about naugh-ty. She\u2019d never revealed this much skin before. Not even to herself. There\u2019d never been a need.She\u2019d asked for this, however. \u201cMake me beautiful,\u201d she\u2019d said to Kaia the moment Aeron had stomped from the fortress.</p><p>\u201cOh, goodie! A slut-it-up makeover,\u201d the Harpy had responded.</p><p>The other two warriors, William and Paris, had groaned. Paris had even sung, \u201cBoor-ring,\u201d under his breath before leaving. William had tried to stick around to \u201chelp,\u201d but Kaia had threatened to use his balls as earrings.</p><p>After that the Harpy had eyed Olivia with amusement. \u201cYou want Aeron to realize his mistake, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d More than that, she\u2019d wanted to shed her angelic image completely. Once and for all. She\u2019d thought, by removing her robe, she could remove her fear and uncertainty, too. She\u2019d thought, by donning the \u201cslut-gear,\u201d she could also cloak herself in confidence and aggression.</p><p>And as she spun a second time for a look at her backside, she realized she\u2019d been right. Well, she realized she was right after her dizziness faded. Thankfully she was getting used to her legs\u2014kind of\u2014and managed to remain upright.</p><p>\u201cI love it,\u201d she said, grinning. She looked like a new person. She even looked human. But most of all, she looked radiant, and seeing that radiance was like swimming in a pool of power.</p> <p>I\u2019m strong. I\u2019m beautiful.</p><p>What would Aeron think? In all the time she\u2019d watched him, she\u2019d never seen him pay any specific female attention\u2014besides herself, the past few nights and this morning. So she wasn\u2019t sure what kind of woman attracted him.</p><p>And it was better that way, she supposed. She couldn\u2019t pretend to be something she wasn\u2019t. Otherwise she\u2019d still be in the heavens. So he would have to like her for herself. Which was what she wanted most. If he couldn\u2019t do so, well, he wasn\u2019t worth her time anyway.</p><p>He\u2019ll like you. How could he not?</p><p>Confidence was nice.</p><p>\u201cThose are make-a-man-beg clothes for sure,\u201d Kaia replied. The redhead had spent the last hour rifling through her closet to dress Olivia exactly right. \u201cI stole them from a little place in town.\u201d</p><p>Wait. \u201cThese garments haven\u2019t been paid for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Why did she suddenly feel sexier? Olivia wondered. Was she becoming as bad as the demons? Maybe she\u2019d send the shop a little money. You don\u2019t have any money. Maybe she\u2019d send the shop some of Aeron\u2019s money.</p><p>\u201cNow sit,\u201d Kaia commanded, motioning to the chair in front of the vanity mirror with a tilt of her chin.</p><p>Cameo moaned. \u201cYou\u2019re not done yet?\u201d She sat upon the bed, waiting (im)patiently for the slut-it-up session to end. \u201cI have so many questions.\u201d</p><p>Kaia shrugged. \u201cAsk her while I do her makeup.\u201d</p><p>Olivia perched on the plush cushion as commanded and Kaia crouched in front of her. The Harpy had already palmed an eye-shadow brush and a case of azure powder. Never having worn makeup before, she wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about that much color, but she didn\u2019t complain. This was one of the reasons she was here, after all. To experience everything the world had to offer.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d Kaia said. When she complied, the brush began to dance gently over her lids. \u201cYou\u2019re up, Cameo.\u201d</p><p>No other prompting was needed. \u201cYou said you know where some of the demon-possessed immortals are staying,\u201d Cameo said, getting down to business.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Again, no lightning struck and no angelic army swooped in.</p><p>\u201cAeron met a girl the night he saved you. She was surrounded by screaming shadows, whatever that means. Do you know her?\u201d</p><p>Olivia was nodding before she could stop herself.</p><p>\u201cBe still,\u201d Kaia told her. \u201cNow I have to fix your eye. It looks like I hit you. While I like that look, I don\u2019t think Aeron will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She straightened her spine, keeping her chin immobile. \u201cThat was Scarlet, daughter of Rhea. Oh, and if you don\u2019t know, Rhea is the self-proclaimed mother to all the earth and embittered wife of Cronus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cameo gasped out. \u201cShadow Girl\u2019s a daughter of the gods? And not just any gods, but the king and queen of the Titans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, one god. Cronus isn\u2019t her father. Rhea spent forbidden time with a Myrmidon warrior when she and Cronus first began warring with each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were they warring?\u201d Kaia asked. \u201cI feel like I should know the answer, but I never kept up with heavenly politics.\u201d</p><p>Easy enough to explain. \u201cCronus planned to lock their children, the Greeks, in Tartarus because his old All-Seeing Eye had predicted they would usurp his power. Rhea merely wanted them banished to earth. But he locked them away, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Cameo muttered a quick \u201chmm\u201d before saying, \u201cSo this Scarlet was conceived...when?\u201d</p><p>Such a sad voice...Olivia\u2019s heart actually bled, hurting more intently with every word the female spoke. \u201cRhea had her affair as she deliberated ways to help the Greeks escape Tartarus and overthrow Cronus. Her lover even helped her enact that plan, and died for his efforts. However, the Greeks were ultimately freed. Rhea expected to continue ruling, but Zeus feared she would later aid Cronus and locked her away right alongside his father. Scarlet was born and raised inside the prison.\u201d</p><p>As she\u2019d spoken, brush, sponge and stick had been used on her face, one after the other. Nervousness bloomed, burning her stomach. She prayed she wouldn\u2019t resemble a clown when Kaia finished.</p><p>\u201cSo this Scarlet is possessed by...Shadows?\u201d Cameo asked. \u201cDarkness? If so, I\u2019m not sure how either one can be considered evil. They seem like gifts rather than curses. To always be able to hide...to strike your enemy without being seen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking in terms of absolutes,\u201d Olivia explained. \u201cYour demon, Misery, isn\u2019t necessarily a curse, either, for without pain there couldn\u2019t be pleasure. Think about it. Everyone must experience the dark emotions on some level to appreciate what they have. Your demon is simply the extreme of the emotion. As is the case with the other Lords. And with Scarlet. But the demon she carries is neither darkness nor shadows. What she has inside her is Nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, wow,\u201d Kaia said. \u201cAnd I thought the guys here were lucky. That has to be, like, the coolest demon ever.\u201d</p><p>Nightmares? Cool? Hardly. \u201cThe darkness Scarlet summons is a complete absence of light. It\u2019s an abyss within her, a never-ending pit of gloom. And inside that gloom lie the very things humans fear most.\u201d</p><p>There was a rustle of clothing and she pictured Cameo shifting on the bed, leaning closer to her. \u201cHow do you know so much about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve encountered many demons over the centuries. As a former bringer of joy, I saw how and why demonic influence ruined human lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh, cool. So what did you do with those demons?\u201d Kaia asked. \u201cStart with how you kicked ass and end with mopping up the blood.\u201d</p><p>Adorable Harpy, to view her as so strong. \u201cI didn\u2019t fight them myself. If my presence alone failed to send them fleeing, I would have to summon a warrior angel to dispatch them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s backtrack a minute,\u201d Cameo said. \u201cThat kind of experience wouldn\u2019t tell you where Scarlet was and what she could do.\u201d</p><p>Busted. Olivia\u2019s cheeks heated. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching Aeron for a while and knew he wished to meet the others of his kind. I made sure to study those nearby\u2014the closest of whom just happened to be Scarlet. There are a few others also scattered about, but most are hiding around the world.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cInteresting. Are they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. My turn to ask a question,\u201d Kaia interjected. \u201cSo is this Scarlet a good guy or a bad guy?\u201d</p><p>Olivia pondered her answer. \u201cI suppose that depends on your definition of good and bad. She was raised in a prison, surrounded by criminals. That\u2019s all she knew before being paired with her demon and later cast to Earth. Everything she\u2019s done, she\u2019s done to survive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs have we,\u201d Cameo muttered.</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t true for Olivia. Everything she\u2019d recently done, she\u2019d done to suit her own needs. She should feel guilty about that, she thought, but...she didn\u2019t. In discovering the path to her happiness, she just might discover Aeron\u2019s, as well.</p><p>No \u201cjust might\u201d about it, her newfound confidence piped up.</p><p>Finally Kaia finished applying the makeup, the brush strokes ceasing. The Harpy clapped her hands and whistled. \u201cAll done, and damn, I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Olivia cracked open her eyelids. The moment she found the mirror, she gasped. And she\u2019d thought herself radiant before... The blue shadow complemented the color of her eyes, making them appear electric. The black mascara added so much length to her lashes, they nearly reached her brows, offering the perfect frame. The rosy blush on her cheeks gave her a just-roused-from-bed glow, and the bloodred lipstick gave her lips a kiss-me glaze.</p> <p>\u201cNo need to offer your firstborn in thanks,\u201d Kaia said. \u201cI only accept cash. Now, if you\u2019d like, we can go into town, find Anya, \u2019cause I think she\u2019s still there, grab a beer and a man and continue your miseducation.\u201d</p><p>Still entranced, Olivia reached up and grazed a fingertip over the half ring of black under her eyes. They were smoky, sultry. Perfect.</p><p>Try to resist me now, Aeron, she thought. I dare you.</p><p>Confidence was more than nice. Confidence was soul-changing.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave,\u201d Cameo protested. \u201cI\u2019m not done with my questions.\u201d</p><p>Kaia rolled her eyes. \u201cSo ask them in town while we\u2019re drinking ourselves into a stupor. I\u2019m thirsty, and Anya will decapitate us if we fail to include her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have an answer for everything,\u201d the female Lord grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI know, right? Isn\u2019t it wonderful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>As the two bantered back and forth, Olivia next traced her lips. Soon she would know the feel of Aeron\u2019s. Again, no \u201cmight\u201d about it. He wouldn\u2019t be able to resist her. She could barely resist herself. Would his lips be hard or soft? Would they plunder or be gentle? Didn\u2019t matter, really. She would finally taste him, and that\u2019s what she craved most.</p><p>\u201cIsss thisss her? Isss thisss the one? Well, guesss what? You will die, angel,\u201d a new voice suddenly proclaimed, and there was enough hate in that voice to slay an army.</p><p>Olivia jolted up and spun, barely managing to remain upright. A tiny demon stood across the bedroom, its eyes bright red with malice. Its claws were elongated and ready for attack, its teeth sharp and bared. Even its green scales seemed sharpened, standing on end like pieces of broken glass\u2014ready to cut.</p><p>This time, she hadn\u2019t fallen into hell. Hell had come to her.</p><p>No! A scream formed in her throat, but just before it could unfurl, it lodged in the knot growing there, so all that emerged was a choking sound.</p> <p>Calm, steady. She\u2019d caught a glimpse of this creature a few times while following Aeron and knew who it was. Legion. You don\u2019t have to be afraid.</p><p>Squaring her shoulders, she tried to unfold her wings for balance\u2014only to be reminded that she no longer had them. She gulped. \u201cHello, Legion. My name is Olivia. I\u2014I mean you no harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSssorry, but I can\u2019t sssay the sssame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now.\u201d Cameo jumped in front of Olivia, acting as a shield. \u201cThere\u2019ll be none of that. We\u2019re all friends here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you, too, if you get in my way,\u201d Legion snarled. \u201cMove! That angel isss mine.\u201d</p><p>Kaia pressed into Cameo\u2019s side, the two more than a shield. They were a wall. \u201cWell, I guess you\u2019ll have to kill me, too, then.\u201d</p><p>They were...protecting her? Guarding her? Despite her fear, Olivia\u2019s chest swelled with pleasure. They didn\u2019t know her, yet they were treating her as one of their own. As if she already belonged.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Kaia demanded. \u201cWhat\u2019s it gonna be, demon girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI accept your offer. I\u2019ll kill you, too.\u201d Then Legion...disappeared.</p><p>O-kay. After her words, that disappearance was a relief. But why would\u2014</p><p>She reappeared between the two warrior women. Before either had time to deflect or prepare, she\u2019d bitten them both on the neck. Both women collapsed on the ground, writhing and moaning in pain.</p><p>Olivia barely had time to process what she\u2019d witnessed. \u201cHow could you do such a thing! I thought they were your friends. They hadn\u2019t hurt you, only wanted to save me.\u201d</p><p>Those red eyes locked on her, the hate intensifying. \u201cAeron isss mine. You don\u2019t get to have him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t agree with you.\u201d Though Olivia trembled\u2014she was alone, weaponless, defenseless and unstable\u2014she stood her ground. \u201cAeron will be mine.\u201d One way or another. She wouldn\u2019t lie about that, even to save herself.</p><p>A forked tongue swiped over those pointed teeth. \u201cYou gonna pay for that, angel. With your life.\u201d</p><p>Legion leapt at her.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>SEVEN DAYS. Seven damn days, and not a single result. Strider, keeper of Defeat, wiped his sweaty face with a towel. He propped himself against the boulder at his back and surveyed his surroundings. The sun was shining brightly, hotter here than it had ever been in Buda. Pristine water gently washed toward this island near Rome, the soft hum of it a balm for his ears.</p><p>All that remained of the Temple of the Unspoken Ones were battered pillars identical to the one at his back\u2014some fallen, some standing\u2014and an altar still stained and splattered with crimson. There was a vibration of energy in the air. Energy that caused his hair to stand on end. And yet, despite the altar and the energy, Strider felt an odd sort of kinship with the place. After all, a lot of people considered him an unspoken one. Evil and unnecessary.Not that he agreed. He was paired with Defeat and couldn\u2019t lose a single challenge without suffering for it. Where was the evil in that? Wasn\u2019t like he killed indiscriminately just to win an Xbox game or anything.</p><p>Anyway. Last time he\u2019d been here, archaeologists had been studying every nook and cranny. Hunters had been among their numbers, hoping to find one of Cronus\u2019s powerful artifacts or even Pandora\u2019s box itself. They weren\u2019t here anymore. Why?</p><p>Though the temple had risen from the sea only a few months ago, trees had already grown, tall and lush and green. They circled the area where the temple had once stood proud, but they didn\u2019t quite touch that temple. They actually arched away from it, as if afraid of getting too close.</p><p>What was here that hadn\u2019t been the last time he\u2019d visited was bones. Human bones. The archaeologists\u2019, most likely. What had killed them, he could only guess. There was no trace of flesh or blood. Yeah, an animal could have devoured so many people in the handful of months since he\u2019d last been here, but wouldn\u2019t there have been some trace of the feasting? Well, besides the bones. A bloodstain here, a piece of rotten meat there. Claw marks where the humans had fought for freedom. Footprints where they had tried to run away.</p><p>There weren\u2019t.</p><p>So. What could consume so cleanly? A godly creature, that\u2019s what.</p><p>Anya, (minor) goddess of Anarchy and Lucien\u2019s girlfriend-slash-soon-to-be-wife\u2014horror of horrors, the naughty little vixen had decided to plan a wedding for herself\u2014didn\u2019t know much about these Unspoken Ones, so wouldn\u2019t verify his idea that they had turned the humans into meals-on-heels. The gods had never, well, spoken of them, she\u2019d said, so she wasn\u2019t sure what they could do. The gods had feared them, however.</p><p>Still, Strider wasn\u2019t leaving. He had to find those artifacts. He had to find Pandora\u2019s box. He had to destroy the Hunters. Finally. His life depended on it. Hell, his peace of mind depended on it. Every day Defeat spoke a little louder inside his head, so every day he was reminded more and more of the first days of his possession. Days he wanted to forget.</p><p>His demon had been a roar, a constant scream, the consuming need to challenge everyone he encountered driving him. No matter the consequences. Kill a friend? So be it. As long as he won.</p><p>He\u2019d hated himself back then. His friends had probably hated him, too. Well, not true. They\u2019d been as wild from their demons as he\u2019d been from his. It had taken centuries to learn how to control themselves. But while they now had control of their darker halves, he was edging closer to its loss.</p><p>\u201cLooks like someone decided to take his break before the rest of us,\u201d a raspy voice teased from behind him.</p><p>Strider turned. Gwen, a redheaded beauty who was stronger and more vicious than any of the Lords, approached him, a glistening bottle of water in her hand. She tossed it at him, and he easily caught it. Within seconds, he had the entire thing drained. Gods, the cold felt good as the liquid moistened his dry throat.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Slowly she grinned, and he knew exactly why Sabin had fallen in love with her. Naughty women ruled. \u201cI stole it from Sabin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that, wife,\u201d Sabin said, striding around the boulder across from them. He increased his speed until he reached Gwen\u2019s side, then draped an arm around her shoulders.</p><p>Immediately she reached up and twined her fingers with his. She even leaned her head against his side, trusting the man to hold her up and keep her safe. They might enjoy one-upping each other, but they were unified. That much was clear.</p><p>Their pairing had initially shocked Strider, truth be told. After all, Gwen was Galen\u2019s daughter and Galen was leader of their greatest enemy. More than that, Sabin was the keeper of Doubt and Gwen had been a timid little mouse the first time the two had met. The demon had practically eaten her alive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now, there wasn\u2019t a more confident woman alive. How the two had reached this point and made things work, Strider wasn\u2019t sure. He was just glad he wasn\u2019t the one in a committed relationship. He liked women\u2014even the un-naughty ones. Oh, did he like women. But relationships? Not so much.</p><p>He\u2019d had a few girlfriends over the years, and at first, he\u2019d loved it. Loved the commitment, the exclusivity. When they\u2019d discovered his penchant for winning, however, most of them had tried to work it to their advantage.</p><p>\u201cBet you can\u2019t make me fall in love with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt you can convince me that we\u2019re meant to be together forever.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d played that game too many times before, winning hearts he\u2019d no longer had any interest in winning. Now, he enjoyed them once\u2014maybe twice\u2014fine, maybe three times\u2014and then it was goodbye old, hello new.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this about breaking early?\u201d Sabin ushered Gwen to the altar and leaned his hip against the stone. He guided her in front of him, again wrapped her in his arms and held her tight against his chest, her head resting under his chin.</p><p>Strider shrugged. \u201cI was thinking.\u201d Rather than examining the stones for symbols or messages as he\u2019d been ordered.</p><p>Sabin had been Strider\u2019s leader his entire life. Yeah, Lucien had been commander of the elite army while they\u2019d lived in the heavens, but it had been Sabin that Strider had looked to for advice and guidance. Still did. The man would have beheaded his own mother if it meant winning a battle. Not that any of them had a mother. They\u2019d been born fully formed. But Strider valued that kind of commitment.</p> <p>\u201cDid I hear someone say it was break time?\u201d Kane, keeper of Disaster, asked with a grin of his own as he rounded a corner. His hair, which was a mix of brown, black and gold, as well as his eyes, which were a mix of brown and green, gleamed in the amber sunlight.</p><p>Had he always been that colorful? Strider wondered. They\u2019d been together forever, but Strider didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever seen the man so...happy. Almost glowing. Maybe the temple agreed with him.</p><p>A gust of wind suddenly rose among the trees. A branch snapped off and flew toward the men. Of course, it smacked Kane in the back of the head. Used to such catastrophes, his stride didn\u2019t even slow. Maybe the temple didn\u2019t agree with him.</p><p>Strider chuckled. That wouldn\u2019t be the last of Kane\u2019s woes, he was sure. Rocks tended to fall and ground tended to crack whenever the warrior arrived at the scene.</p><p>Behind him, gravel crunched under boots and Strider turned again. Amun, Reyes and Maddox, the last of their group, were closing the distance.</p><p>\u201cBreak?\u201d Amun said, his deep voice almost raw from disuse. He was dark from head to toe and as the keeper of Secrets, he rarely spoke, too afraid he would reveal devastating truths the warriors wouldn\u2019t be able to recover from. But as he\u2019d recently spilled many of those secrets, anyway, to calm Gideon from a rage, he\u2019d been a bit more talkative.</p> <p>The change did Strider\u2019s heart good.</p><p>\u201cGuess so,\u201d he replied.</p><p>Sabin rolled his eyes. \u201cLook what you\u2019ve started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with a break? I\u2019m tired. And gods know we\u2019re not making any progress.\u201d Maddox was, perhaps, their most dangerous member. Or rather, had been. Before he\u2019d met his Ashlyn. Now, there was a gentleness to his violet eyes that none of the other Lords possessed.</p><p>Too bad that gentleness only extended to the delicate Ashlyn. Maddox was paired with the demon of Violence and when that boy erupted... Ouch. Strider had been on the receiving end of the man\u2019s need to hurt and maim a time or two. And yes, Strider had won, even then, dishing more punches and slices than he\u2019d received. He just couldn\u2019t help himself.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve searched the grounds, x-rayed the stones hoping to find something inside them, and spilled our own blood hoping to draw the Unspoken Ones out with a sacrifice.\u201d Reyes, as dark as Amun but far more tense, splayed his arms, still cut and bleeding from his latest offering. Or from self-torture. One never knew with Reyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s left for us to do?\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked to Sabin.</p><p>\u201cThey were the ones who told us Danika was the All-Seeing Eye. I don\u2019t understand why they won\u2019t help us out again,\u201d the warrior said, his own frustration clear.</p> <p>The All-Seeing Eye could see into heaven and hell. She knew what the gods were planning, what the demons were planning, as well as the outcome of all those plans\u2014but not necessarily at the right time. Details came to her in spurts, out of sequence.</p><p>Sabin spun in a circle, calling, \u201cAll we want to know is where the other two artifacts are. Is that too much to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust help us, damn it,\u201d Kane shouted, getting into the spirit.</p><p>\u201cOtherwise, I\u2019ll rip each stone from this island and toss them into the sea,\u201d Maddox added.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll help him,\u201d Strider vowed. \u201cOnly I\u2019ll piss on them first.\u201d</p><p>As his voice echoed from the rocks, the air seemed to thicken with challenge. The insects in the trees even quieted.</p><p>\u201cWhoa\u2014maybe you shouldn\u2019t have threatened to violate their property,\u201d Reyes muttered.</p><p>Oopsie.</p><p>Next, the world around them faded, leaving only the pillars and the altar. Only, every one of the pillars was suddenly upright and the altar was now gleaming white marble scrubbed clean of debris.</p><p>Unsure what was happening, each of the warriors stiffened, straightened and grabbed for a weapon.</p><p>Strider was proficient with both guns and knives, but usually preferred to slice and dice. Today, however, he\u2019d make use of his Sig Sauer. He kept the muzzle down, but that didn\u2019t mean it was any less dangerous. He could aim and fire in less time than it took to blink.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Gwen whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know, but be ready for anything,\u201d Sabin warned.</p><p>Any other warrior would have shoved the woman behind his back to protect her. Not so with Sabin. Men and women had always been equals to him, and even though he loved Gwen more than life itself and wanted her protected more than he wanted victory, everyone here knew that Gwen was the strongest among them. She\u2019d saved more than one Lord already.</p><p>Strider, though, did inch to the front\u2014of her, of everyone. That sense of challenge... He had to be the one to win this thing.</p><p>His demon was already chanting. Win...win...must win...can\u2019t lose.</p><p>I know, he growled. I will.</p><p>He pivoted, gaze roving, searching. Finally, he spotted his prey. A huge man\u2014no, that thing couldn\u2019t be called a man. A huge beast had materialized between two of the pillars.</p><p>Even as Strider\u2019s stomach tightened, he took his quarry\u2019s measure. The beast wasn\u2019t dressed, but then, he didn\u2019t need clothing. His skin was furred like that of a horse. Snakes danced and hissed from his head, their thin bodies acting as his hair. Two long fangs protruded over his bottom lip. He had human hands, but his feet were hooves.</p><p>Muscle was stacked upon muscle on his torso, and his nipples were pierced by two large silver rings. Metal chains circled his neck, wrists and ankles, and those chains kept him tethered to the pillars.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Strider demanded. No need to ask what the thing was. Ugly as shit covered it.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t expected an answer, but damn if the ensuing silence didn\u2019t irritate him.</p><p>Then, beside the beast, between two other pillars, another monster appeared, and Strider blinked at the sudden addition. This one was male, as well, but only the lower half of his body was covered by carmine fur. His chest was a mass of scars. He, too, was anchored in place by chains.</p><p>Still. Those chains didn\u2019t detract from the menace radiating from either of them.</p><p>\u201cMy gods. Look,\u201d Kane breathed, pointing.</p><p>A third beast appeared, and this one was female. Like the men, her torso was bare. Her breasts were large, her nipples also pierced, though with diamonds rather than silver hoops. A leather skirt wrapped around her waist and thighs. She stood in profile, and Strider could see the small horns protruding from her spine. The horns he actually liked\u2014they\u2019d give a man something to hold on to when things got rough. Her face, however, was beaked like a bird\u2019s. So bed her? No. She, too, was furred and chained.</p><p>In quick succession, a fourth and fifth appeared, both so tall and wide they were like living mountains. They didn\u2019t have snakes for hair, though. What they had was worse. One was bald, yet shadows seemed to be seeping from his skull. Thick and black and putrid. The other had blades. Small but sharp, they spiked from his scalp, each glistening with something clear and wet.</p><p>The Unspoken Ones.</p><p>Without a doubt. Strider let out a breath. They should have remained the Unseen Ones, as well. \u2019Cause damn.</p><p>Win.</p><p>No challenge has been issued yet, moron. Thank the gods, he added, just for himself. Would he be able to defeat these things?</p><p>The female stepped forward, her chains rattling. The Lords held their ground, and this seemed to please her. She grinned, her too-white teeth sharp as razors. Thankfully, she couldn\u2019t get far, couldn\u2019t reach them, bound to the pillars as she was.</p><p>\u201cOnce more, you have darkened our doorstep.\u201d Her voice rang with the cries of a thousand souls trapped in hell, desperately trying to escape. They screamed from her, echoing through the temple, their tears practically soaking him. \u201cAnd once more, we grant you the honor of our presence. But do not think, even for a moment, that your threats moved us. Desecrate our temple, will you? Go ahead. However, I suggest you say goodbye to your cock before you do so.\u201d</p><p>Win!</p><p>Not a challenge, not a challenge, not a fucking challenge. Please don\u2019t let that be a challenge. He had a feeling the woman meant what she\u2019d said. If he whipped out Stridy Monster to relieve himself, he\u2019d lose Stridy Monster. And there was no greater tragedy than that. Ask anyone who\u2019d been with him.</p><p>\u201cUh, our apologies,\u201d Sabin said in an effort to smooth things over.</p><p>\u201cAccepted,\u201d she replied easily.</p><p>That ease seemed out of place. Wrong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damn. Where was Gideon when you needed him? As the keeper of Lies, that boy knew when someone spoke true\u2014or not. Strider had been apprehensive since the beasts had appeared, but now he wondered, what was their angle? The question churned his apprehension into straight-up fear.</p><p>\u201cNow, the reason for our appearance,\u201d she continued. \u201cYour determination to defeat your enemy is admirable, and we have chosen to reward you for it.\u201d</p><p>A reward? From these creatures? His formerly tight stomach now did a little dance: twist, twist, knot, twist, twist, knot. Wrong, he thought again.</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll help us?\u201d Reyes asked. Gullible fool. \u201cHelp us defeat the Hunters at long last?\u201d</p><p>A laugh. \u201cAs you said yourself, we have already helped you. And we did so without seeking anything in return.\u201d Her gaze, so much like a black hole he already felt as if he were falling, shifted, landed on him and pinned him in place. \u201cDid we not?\u201d</p><p>Just like that, understanding dawned. Anytime you wanted to hook someone on your drug, you gave them the first taste for free. Their aid had been the drug, and the Lords were now the addicts.</p><p>They would have to pay for any further assistance, Strider realized. And pay dearly. Ding, ding, ding. Finally, right.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we can help each other,\u201d Kane suggested, the ground cracking under his feet. He hopped to the side to avoid falling into a black hole of his own.</p> <p>Her chin lifted in haughty disdain. \u201cWe need nothing from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Sabin said, tone unconcerned. But Strider could see the wheels turning in the back of his friend\u2019s mind. \u201cDo you know where the Cloak of Invisibility is? And the Paring Rod?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She offered them another grin, this one loaded like a gun and ready to fire. \u201cWe do.\u201d</p><p>Yep, I\u2019m hooked.</p><p>Win! Defeat repeated.</p><p>Strider licked his lips in anticipation, bones already humming at the thought of victory against the Hunters. Finally, the Super Bowl of wins, here for the taking. Once they had those artifacts, they could find and destroy Pandora\u2019s box. That wouldn\u2019t destroy the Hunters, of course, but it would ruin their plans to use the box to draw the demons out of the Lords, killing the warriors.</p> <p>Man couldn\u2019t live without demon, not anymore. They were two halves of a whole, bonded forever. Defeat was as much a part of him as Stridy Monster.</p><p>The demons were equally bound, though they wouldn\u2019t die if man and spirit were parted. However, they would be crazed, forever hungry to feed their depraved needs but unable to quench themselves.</p><p>After the Hunters had killed Baden, the demon of Distrust had sprung from his body, tortured, screaming, destroying everyone it encountered. Strider had watched, helpless.</p><p>Worse, that demon was still out there, still causing havoc.</p><p>That was the reason the Hunters no longer sought to kill him and his friends. They didn\u2019t want the demons free and unable to be captured. But with the box, they could do both.</p><p>Yet thanks to Danika, they now knew the Hunters had a new plan of action. Somehow, they had found the demon of Distrust. They had managed to capture it and were trying to force it to possess another body. If they succeeded... Strider shuddered. They wouldn\u2019t have to wait for the box. They could kill the Lords, place their demons inside bodies of their choosing and do whatever they wished.</p><p>They claimed they wanted a world without evil, but would they say the same thing if they were in control of all that evil? Hell, no. Power wasn\u2019t easy to give up. As he well knew. No way he\u2019d be able to give up his. He liked winning\u2014and not just because of his demon.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you want from us?\u201d Sabin asked, cautious now. \u201cIn exchange for those artifacts?\u201d</p> <p>Strider almost grinned. Sabin didn\u2019t like miscommunication. He wanted the facts laid out so everyone knew what they were getting into.</p><p>The Unspoken One laughed, and it was a far crueler sound than before. Maybe because this time, she mocked with that laughter. \u201cThink you it is that simple? That you give us a token and in return we give you that which you desire most? How wrong you are, demon. You are not the only ones who seek what we have to offer. Behold.\u201d</p><p>Above the altar, the air thickened, coagulated, and colors sparked to life before bleeding together and forming what seemed to be a movie of some kind. Strider strained to decipher the images\u2014then tensed as Galen came into view. His blond hair, his handsome features, his white feathered wings. As usual, he wore a white robe, as if he truly were an angel rather than a demon-possessed warrior like the rest of them.</p><p>Beside him was a tall, slender female. She was pretty in a sturdy sort of way, with sharp features, dark hair and pale skin. He\u2019d seen her before, he thought, flipping through mental files of ancient Greece, ancient Rome and everywhere else he\u2019d been throughout his very long life, but coming up blank. He pored through more recent times, but again\u2014oh, shit, there. Danika, he realized. Danika had painted her. An enemy.</p><p>Shit, he thought again. Danika had painted this woman in a scene set twentysomething years in the past, yet nothing about her had changed. There wasn\u2019t an age line on her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t human, then.</p><p>Today she was dressed in black leather and strapped to a table, but she wasn\u2019t struggling against her bonds. There was determination in her expression, her gaze following\u2014 No. Surely not. That couldn\u2019t be... It wasn\u2019t possible... But as Strider watched, he saw a ghostlike creature bouncing from one corner of the room to another. Its eyes were red, its face skeletal, its teeth long and sharp.</p><p>No question; it was a demon. A High Lord, like the very being that possessed Strider.</p><p>Strider stopped breathing, every muscle in his body clenching his bones.</p><p>\u201cBaden,\u201d Amun rasped in that unused voice of his, so much longing in his tone that it actually hurt to hear. There\u2019d been something about Baden, something they\u2019d all gravitated to. Something they\u2019d all needed. They\u2019d loved Baden more than they\u2019d loved themselves. More than they loved each other.</p><p>Still did, despite his death.</p><p>\u201cNo damn way.\u201d Kane shook his head almost violently.</p><p>Strider agreed. No damn way. That demon did not carry the essence of their friend. Couldn\u2019t possibly. But there was something familiar about that ghostly being...something gut-wrenching.</p><p>\u201cEnter her,\u201d Galen commanded. \u201cEnter her and your torment will end. You\u2019ll finally have a host. You\u2019ll finally be able to feel, to smell, to taste. Don\u2019t you remember how wonderful that is? Finally you\u2019ll be able to destroy, to shred human trust as you were meant to do.\u201d</p><p>Shred human trust. As Distrust was meant to do. No, he thought again.</p><p>The spirit groaned, and its speed increased. Clearly, it was agitated. Did it know what was happening? Did it want another host? Or was it simply too crazed to understand?</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d the woman begged. \u201cI need you. I need you so badly.\u201d</p><p>So. She was willing. That didn\u2019t mean she knew what would happen to her if she got her wish. For the first century\u2014at least\u2014there would be no remnants of the person she was. She would be fully demon and many, many humans would suffer because of that.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d Galen continued. \u201cIt\u2019s what you want. What you need. All you have to do is touch her and relief is yours. What could be easier?\u201d</p><p>Could the demon understand? he wondered again. As keeper of Hope, Galen could make anyone or thing crave a future they never would have wanted without his influence. Even a demon. That\u2019s how he\u2019d formed his Hunters, by convincing them the world would be a better place without the Lords. A utopia of peace and prosperity.</p><p>As Galen crooned persuasively, even Strider was affected. He wanted to touch the female. There would be relief...his future would be assured...better...</p><p>The demon darted toward the woman, changed its mind, then darted in the other direction. Oh, yes. It understood.</p><p>Don\u2019t do it, Strider projected. He wanted his friend back, yes. More than anything in the world. And in some ways, the demon of Distrust was his friend. Essence of Baden or not. But he didn\u2019t want his friend to be housed in the body of his enemy.</p><p>\u201cDo it!\u201d Galen snarled. \u201cDo it! Now.\u201d</p><p>On and on the spirit circled the room\u2019s ceiling.</p><p>Impatient, Galen threw up his hands. \u201cFine. Forget it. You can spend the rest of eternity the way you\u2019ve spent the last few thousand years. Miserable. Hungry. Unfulfilled. We\u2019re leaving.\u201d He reached out to release the woman\u2019s bonds.</p><p>There was another groan, then a growl, and then the spirit was again darting from one corner to another, gaining speed, nothing but a blur. It fell...fell...and finally slammed into the female\u2019s stomach.</p><p>Had she not been tied down, she would have hurt herself, so intense was her sudden thrashing. Thrashing that increased with every second that passed. She grunted and groaned, her muscles spasming, her features contorting. Then the screams began.</p><p>No. Godsdamn it, no. Strider nearly fell to his knees.</p><p>Galen smiled an evil smile of satisfaction. \u201cIt\u2019s done. At last. Now all we have to do is wait and see if she survives.\u201d</p><p>The door to the room swung open and a group of his followers marched inside. Such perfect timing. They must have been watching nearby on monitors.</p><p>\u201cDo we return to the temple, Great One?\u201d the one in front asked.</p><p>Galen\u2019s answer was lost as the vision wavered, then disappeared altogether.</p><p>Time suddenly seemed suspended, caught in threads of horror and shock.</p><p>Sabin was the first to shake himself loose. \u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d</p><p>What happened? Hell\u2019s gates had just opened, the repercussions he\u2019d already contemplated suddenly real. If the woman survived, Hunters would now be out for blood, as Strider had feared. They would no longer content themselves with merely injuring the Lords. They would crave death. And if their demons were freed, those demons would be caught, paired with someone new, and Galen could build an army of demonic immortals all under his command.</p><p>\u201cBring the images back,\u201d Maddox commanded. \u201cShow us what followed the possession.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSuch a tone will earn you nothing but discontent, Violence, for your enemy wants what you want.

The god king had helped him win several battles. The god king was on his side and would do anything to destroy Galen and the Hunters. So...kill him? Kill the most powerful immortal ever to live? And if he failed, make an enemy of him?</p> <p>\u201cJust how are we supposed to do that?\u201d Kane demanded.</p><p>\u201cI told you it wouldn\u2019t be simple. But though he is a god, and destroying him will prove the most difficult task of your existence, he is very much like you,\u201d the Unspoken One replied. \u201cMore so than you have realized. Use the knowledge to your advantage.\u201d</p><p>Kane shook his head, and a lock of hair slapped his eye. \u201cBut he\u2019s on our team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he?\u201d Another cruel laugh. \u201cDo you not think he will slay you the moment he no longer has need of you? Besides, if you do not bring us his head, your enemy will. And they will receive our prize.\u201d</p><p>Strider\u2019s eyes widened, another answer finally sliding into place. This was why Galen would try for Cronus\u2019s head. This was why Danika had predicted what she had.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t allow Galen to curry favor with these beings. The consequences could be too great\u2014far greater than pissing off Cronus. Shit. Damn it! Fuck. No curse word seemed strong enough.</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you want him dead?\u201d Strider asked. As Sabin always said, knowledge was power. Perhaps in the answer, they could find redemption.</p><p>The creature\u2019s teeth gnashed together. \u201cHe has made us slaves and we will not tolerate such a fate. Surely you understand.\u201d</p><p>Understand, yes. For too long, he\u2019d been a slave to his demon. But there was no redemption in her answer. These beings were determined. They would not be swayed.</p><p>What would happen if they were freed? Roaming unfettered? Nothing good, that much he could guess.</p><p>\u201cYou need time to think,\u201d she continued. \u201cTime we will grant you. And to prove our magnanimous intentions, we will even give you another gift. Enjoy. I know we will.\u201d</p><p>Her eerie, smiling face was the last thing Strider saw before he and the others found themselves transported to another location, a jungle\u2014Hunters suddenly surrounding them.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>OLIVIA AND LEGION circled each other. When the little demon had lunged, Olivia had jumped out of the way, and Legion had slammed into the wall. Now, Olivia studied her foe. She\u2019d seen this type of being\u2014a minion, also known as a demon servant\u2014defeated before. All angels had, even those whose sole purpose was to bring peace and joy to the world. But of course, she\u2019d never fought one herself.</p> <p>Destroying them had never seemed like much of a battle for the warrior angels, though. Not really. They had merely stretched out their arms, their swords of fire appearing. Once those flames\u2014which hadn\u2019t been created in hell, but had instead sprung from her Deity\u2019s mouth, his breath far hotter than the blazes all demons so loved\u2014made contact with scales, the demons disintegrated. This, well, this would not be anything like that.Kaia and Cameo were still on the ground, still writhing, their skin now a light shade of green. As an angel, Olivia would have been able to soothe them, taking their pain into herself and dispatching it. But trapped as she was in this feeble body, she could do nothing.</p><p>Nothing but watch. And fight.</p><p>If she hoped to survive, she needed that which she\u2019d never experienced or embraced before: fury. That was what strengthened humans, after all. Wasn\u2019t it? They seemed to expand, destroy, defeat when they hosted the emotion.</p><p>So...what made her angry? Her time in hell, definitely.</p><p>Though she would rather have plucked out her eyes, Olivia allowed the memory of her time in hell to play through her mind. The flames...the stink...those oozing, roving hands... Sickness churned in her stomach, fear and disgust blending with that first spark of fury. After that, instinct took over and her shock at Kaia\u2019s and Cameo\u2019s mistreatment joined the fray, numbing the fear. Only, thankfully, the fear.</p><p>\u201cYou die thisss day, angel.\u201d</p><p>Her hands curled into fists. I\u2019m strong. \u201cYou can never be with Aeron the way you desire, demon,\u201d she said, knowing the truth in her voice had to be distasteful to a creature raised among liars. \u201cI tell you this not to be cruel, but to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSsshut up. Ssshut up!\u201d Legion swung out her arm, claws bared.</p><p>Olivia bowed her back, leaning out of reach. Without her wings to balance her, she stumbled and nearly fell to the floor.</p><p>\u201cAeron lovesss me. He told me ssso.\u201d</p><p>Most of her fury drained, and there was nothing she could do about it. Compassion was hardwired inside her, as was the need to give happiness rather than heartbreak. They desired the same thing, she and Legion. \u201cAnd it\u2019s true. He loves you, but he doesn\u2019t love you as a man loves a woman. He loves you as a father loves his daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A stomp of a foot. A hiss. \u201cI\u2019ll marry him one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that were the case, I probably wouldn\u2019t have given up my entire way of life to come here and save him. I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be with him.\u201d She spoke as gently as she was able. Emotionally wounding the demon wasn\u2019t her goal. For whatever reason, Aeron did like the...thing. But Olivia knew how demons operated and knew Legion would berate and undermine her unless she was made to understand. \u201cAlready I\u2019ve slept in his bed, curled into his side.\u201d</p><p>Legion didn\u2019t accuse her of lying. How could she? Angels never had the need, and the little fiend knew it. Rather, she stopped and gaped at Olivia, her breathing choppy, shallow. More poison dripped down her fangs.</p><p>\u201cYou want what you cannot have. You envy, you crave. That\u2019s your nature,\u201d Olivia said, \u201cand I understand that nature better than I ever did before because that is the very reason I am here. I envy, I crave. But what you don\u2019t realize is that your leaving hell to be with Aeron has sentenced him to death. You are the reason I was sent to him. You are the reason I was ordered to kill him. You are the reason another assassin will be sent in my place.\u201d She drew in a breath. \u201cYou are the reason he will die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No! I\u2019ll kill the next dirty angel just like I plan to kill you now.\u201d</p><p>That was the only warning Olivia had. One moment Legion was in front of her, the next she was on top of her, and they were falling...down, down. Olivia took the brunt of the impact, her skull cracking on the ledge of the hearth and oxygen shoving from her lungs like a heat-seeking missile. Bright lights winked over her vision, but not enough to obscure the teeth descending toward her neck.</p><p>Lysander had begun training her for her new warrior duties the very day that golden down appeared in her wings, so Olivia knew to jam her palm into Legion\u2019s chin and shove, grinding the demon\u2019s teeth together painfully.</p><p>She\u2019d never relished the thought of battling demons. Especially when Lysander told her that warriors had to distance themselves from their task completely, leaving only a hardened determination to take down their prey. Could she?</p><p>A shock of cold bloomed in her fingers and spread up her arms...into her chest...and that cold numbed more than fear this time, destroying what little remained of her fury, right along with the compassion and disgust.</p><p>Yes. She could, she realized. Shocking.</p><p>Do what you must, a voice whispered through her head. You are angel. She is demon. Let your instincts guide you. Let your faith flow through you.</p><p>For a moment, she thought Lysander was beside her. But then Legion growled, snapping her from her sense of relief, and it didn\u2019t matter. Olivia was ready. Rather than using emotions she had no experience with, she allowed that which was natural to her, faith and love, to consume her, as the voice had instructed. This was true strength.</p><p>With a flick of her arm, she tossed Legion across the room. The demon slammed into the wall and slid to the floor. All the while, those red eyes remained narrowed on her.</p><p>Up. Now.</p><p>Olivia jumped up and pressed her back into the hearth. The new position limited her range of motion, but she needed something to balance her when\u2014</p><p>Legion sprang at her.</p><p>Olivia ducked and once again the demon hit the wall. As she ricocheted backward, plaster dusted the air, filling Olivia\u2019s nose and making her cough. Still, she didn\u2019t hesitate to kick out her leg and propel Legion to her bottom. Faith\u2014she could win this. Love\u2014good against evil. The heel of Olivia\u2019s foot must have somehow cut past those scales because crimson seeped from the demon\u2019s breastbone.</p><p>\u201cI will not allow you to hurt me, demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to ssstop me.\u201d</p><p>Again Legion leapt up. Again she threw herself onto Olivia, clinging like a vine. Teeth snapped and nails clawed. Olivia punched left, right and forward, working one knee between them to preserve some distance, but barely managing to keep herself upright. Legion shifted her head from side to side to avoid impact, but she wasn\u2019t always successful. A cheekbone cracked. Her nose broke.</p><p>Across the room, glass shattered. Then a dark winged figure was there, wild gaze searching...landing on the still-struggling women. Aeron. Their eyes met, and time suddenly seemed suspended. His lips were pulled back in a tight scowl, and his tattoos were so black they were like shadows on his skin.</p><p>A bubble of excitement burst through her and Olivia lost her focus. Her hand collided with the demon\u2019s mouth, an area she\u2019d been avoiding; Legion took full advantage and bit, those razor-sharp fangs cutting deep, thick poison dripping straight into her veins. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Olivia screamed. The burn, like acid and salt and fire...oh, Deity. Her hand was turning to ash, surely. But when she looked down, she saw the flesh was merely cut and bleeding, a little swollen.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d Aeron shouted, rushing to her.</p><p>Her knees gave out and she slid to the floor, no longer able to hold her own weight. She clutched her hand to her chest, breathing suddenly too difficult. The pain was just too intense, like having her wings ripped out all over again.</p> <p>Before, during the fight, stars had winked over her eyes. Now she saw black spots and they were a thousand times worse. They grew and intertwined, ruining her sight and leaving her in a dark void of solitude and pain.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to her?\u201d Aeron snarled, cutting through the illusion of aloneness. And even though he was angry, she welcomed the intrusion.</p><p>\u201cPro-protecting myself,\u201d Olivia managed to work past trembling lips.</p><p>\u201cNot you,\u201d he said, and this time his tone was gentle. Callused fingers smoothed over her brow, just as gentle, brushing her hair out of the way.</p><p>Despite the agony still blistering and sizzling in her hand, she offered him a weak smile. Aeron might not have wanted her to stay in the fortress, might even have run from her, but on some level he cared about her well-being. He\u2019d bypassed Kaia and Cameo and come straight for Olivia.</p> <p>Her newfound confidence had not been misplaced.</p><p>There was a shuffle of footsteps. Then, \u201cAeron, my Aeron. Ssshe\u2019sss nothing. Leave her and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only one leaving her will be you. I told you to stay away from her, Legion. I told you not to hurt her.\u201d Aeron\u2019s hands fell away from Olivia and she moaned, bereft. \u201cYou disobeyed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to my room. Now. We\u2019ll talk about this later.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then a sob. \u201cAeron, pleassse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me. Go.\u201d Clothing rustled. He must have turned away from her. \u201cWhat did she do to you, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-hand,\u201d she managed to work past chattering teeth. She still felt as if she was on fire, and yet, now she was as cold as ice. \u201cBite.\u201d</p><p>Those strong, callused fingers returned to her, only this time, they circled her wrist and lifted her hand. Probably to inspect the injury, but that didn\u2019t matter. The action increased the velocity of her blood-flow, which increased the intensity of the pain, and she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it better,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cOthers were bitten first. Help them, then me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply. Instead, he fit his warm lips around her wound and began sucking. In this, he was not gentle. Her back arched and another scream ripped from her. She tried to jerk from his clasp but he held tight, sucking, sucking, and then spitting. Sucking, sucking, spitting.</p><p>Gradually, the pain ebbed. The burn cooled and the ice melted, and she slumped against the floor like a doll. Only then did Aeron stop.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019ll take care of the others,\u201d he said, voice hoarse.</p> <p>The black faded from her vision, and she watched fuzzily as he strode to Cameo and gave her the same treatment, sucking the poison from the wound in her neck and spitting it out. When the warrior woman finally stilled, sighing in relief, he turned his attentions to the Harpy.</p><p>As he was spitting out the last mouthful, the bedroom door burst open and two warriors rushed inside. Paris and William. The two searched the room, weapons drawn. Paris wielded some type of gun. William, two blades.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Paris demanded. \u201cTorin texted us that you busted through Kaia\u2019s window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat timing,\u201d Aeron replied dryly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d William said, all innocence. \u201cWe did you a favor, taking our time. We thought you were playing kinky sex games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will...kill that...fucking bitch!\u201d A scowling Kaia lumbered to her feet. \u201cShe bit me. She fucking bit me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with her.\u201d Aeron rose, as well. His expression was bleak but no less determined. \u201cNot you.\u201d</p><p>Kaia pointed a finger into his chest and lifted to her tiptoes, but that still didn\u2019t place them nose to nose. \u201cNo, you\u2019ll baby her like you always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll deal with her,\u201d he repeated firmly.</p><p>\u201cHold everything. I missed a four-way chick fight. Then I find out someone\u2019s been nibbling.\u201d William\u2019s attention shifted to Olivia, who was still lying on the floor. \u201cPlease tell me our sweet little angel is the biter. It\u2019ll make me want her ever so much more.\u201d</p><p>Aeron growled low in his throat, closed the distance and crouched beside Olivia. \u201cGet out of here, Willy. You\u2019re not wanted or needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg to differ,\u201d William huffed.</p><p>\u201cRather than allow Aeron to kill you, I\u2019ll explain what happened on the way out.\u201d Cameo scrubbed a hand down her face before holding out her arm expectantly.</p><p>William just arched a brow. A frowning Paris strode forward, clasped her hand and tugged her upright.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she muttered with an irritated look to William.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou\u2019re not my type, so I don\u2019t feel the need to help you.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cEvery woman\u2019s your type.\u201d</p><p>That should have made everyone in the room laugh, but tragic as Cameo\u2019s voice was, everyone cringed.</p><p>Aeron scooped Olivia up. Good thing. All energy had abandoned her. Her muscles were still trembling, reminding her of the aftershocks of an earthquake. Without a word to the others, who hadn\u2019t left as planned, he carted her into the hall.</p><p>\u201cEvery time I stumble upon you, you\u2019re injured,\u201d Aeron said.</p><p>True, but she wasn\u2019t going to ask him to stay away. \u201cI suppose I should thank you for saving me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou suppose, angel?\u201d He snorted.</p><p>Fine. No supposing about it, but no way would she admit it. He\u2019d called her angel. Again. Which meant he still saw her as she\u2019d once been, not as she now was. He needed to realize she\u2019d left her sweetness behind with her robe.</p><p>\u201cWith that attitude,\u201d she said, \u201cyou\u2019ll get no thanks from me. Ever.\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>She fought a wave of disappointment. \u201cSo?\u201d she prompted.</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>Impossible man. \u201cDo you now assume I\u2019m weak and easily breakable?\u201d</p><p>Again, he gave no reply. Which meant that, yes, he did. She frowned. As much as he hated weakness, she would never be able to work her way into his bed\u2014with him in it and naked, that is\u2014if this kept up.</p><p>She\u2019d have to find a way to prove how strong she really was.</p><p>The words faith and love once more drifted through her mind. She doubted he was ready for either one, however. And besides, she didn\u2019t love him. Did she? She just didn\u2019t know. What she felt for him was different from what she\u2019d ever felt for anyone else, but she\u2019d never loved anyone in the romantic sense.</p><p>All she really knew about that kind of love was that it meant being willing to die for the other person. As Ashlyn had for Maddox. As Anya almost had for Lucien. Was she ready to die for Aeron? No. She didn\u2019t think so. She hadn\u2019t offered such a compromise to the Council when she\u2019d had the chance, something they might have considered. Sacrifice always earned a reward.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d she asked, changing the subject. She was still too groggy to reason things out. More than that, Legion was in his bedroom and Olivia was not ready for another run-in. If that was where he was headed, then\u2014</p><p>\u201cMy bedroom,\u201d he said, and her stomach clenched.</p><p>Ugh. He was. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegion isn\u2019t there. As always, she disobeyed me. I felt her leave this plane of existence.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. She\u2019d known they were linked, but that was...wow. \u201cYou\u2019re that connected to her?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>Maybe Legion was right. Maybe she was meant to be with Aeron. The thought was like another injection of acid in Olivia\u2019s veins. She herself wanted to be more than Aeron\u2019s acquaintance, more than his friend. She wanted to be his lover. That had never been clearer than now, this moment, as his strong arms banded around her and held her close. As his heart hammered against her ear and his warm breath trekked over her skin. But she wouldn\u2019t share him with Legion, no matter how much she desired him.</p><p>You won\u2019t have to. You\u2019re a confident, aggressive woman now, and you go after what you want.</p><p>True.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry she hurt you,\u201d Aeron said gruffly, surprising her. \u201cShe\u2019s just a child, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. I\u2019m going to stop you there.\u201d Though she did like hearing him apologize. \u201cLegion isn\u2019t a child. She\u2019s not much younger than you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, he just blinked down at her. \u201cBut she\u2019s so innocent.\u201d</p><p>Innocent? Now Olivia was the one to snort. \u201cWhat kind of life have you led that you consider that little fiend innocent?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched as he pounded up a flight of stairs. Her weight didn\u2019t seem to bother him. \u201cIt\u2019s just...her lisp, I guess. And her joy at dressing up and playing princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s spent her life in hell, surrounded by evil, souls being tortured in every corner. Of course dressing up is fun to her, but that doesn\u2019t mean her mind is childlike. She loves you, Aeron.\u201d Or so she said. Would Legion die for him? \u201cShe wants you the way a woman wants a man.\u201d There was no question of that.</p><p>He stopped in the middle of another hallway, one foot raised midair. He tilted his head until their gazes locked together, his violet irises wild. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. She loves me like a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She plans to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You hear me and you know I speak true.\u201d</p><p>A muscle in his jaw ticked. \u201cIf what you say is correct\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. Again, you hear the truth in my voice.\u201d</p><p>Aeron gulped, shook his head as if to dislodge her claim. At least he didn\u2019t try to deny it this time. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her, tell her a romantic relationship isn\u2019t possible. She\u2019ll understand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Only a man could delude himself in such a way.</p><p>He kicked back into motion, silent now. At his door, he shouldered his way inside. Olivia tensed, but sure enough, Legion was nowhere to be seen. She sighed with relief as Aeron laid her atop the soft mattress.</p><p>\u201cAeron,\u201d she said, not ready for him to leave and suspecting he intended to do so.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d He remained in place, hovering over her, and smoothed a hand through her hair.</p><p>She almost purred as she leaned into the touch. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it before. When I said I wouldn\u2019t thank you. I truly am grateful for your aid.\u201d</p><p>What are you doing? He\u2019ll never see you as a potential lover if you constantly remind him of your angelic nature.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well.\u201d Clearly uncomfortable, he coughed as he straightened. \u201cAre you hurt anywhere else?\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for her reply, but cast his gaze over the length of her. Perhaps that was his first full glance at her new clothing, because his jaw suddenly dropped. \u201cYou...you\u2019re...\u201d</p><p>Perhaps her potential lover status wasn\u2019t in jeopardy, after all. Confident. \u201cIsn\u2019t it pretty? Kaia helped me.\u201d Aggressive. She smoothed her hands down her breasts, stomach and hips, wishing he were touching her instead. Goose bumps broke out over her skin. Oh, now that was a surprise. It felt good. Really, really good. She\u2019d have to remember to touch herself like this again.</p> <p>\u201cPretty,\u201d he said thickly, hotly. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of my makeup?\u201d When his gaze lifted to her face, she traced a fingertip over her lips. \u201cI hope Legion didn\u2019t smear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...nice.\u201d Again, his voice was thick and hot.</p><p>Was that good or bad?</p><p>Did it matter? She wanted him; she\u2019d decided to go after him. She would have him.</p><p>Licking her lips\u2014and tasting coconut, hmm\u2014she sat up, propping her weight on one elbow and reaching for Aeron with the other. She flattened her palm over his pounding heart. Part of her blushed at such boldness, screaming to pull back. The other part preened, shouting to rush onward.</p> <p>To achieve great joy, she reminded herself, you often had to step out of your comfort zone.</p><p>So step out already. \u201cYou can kiss me if you want.\u201d Please, please, let that be what he wants.</p><p>For a moment, he stopped breathing. At least, his chest stopped moving. A blaze erupted in his eyes, expanding his pupils, and his muscles twitched under her grip. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t. You shouldn\u2019t. You\u2019re an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFallen,\u201d she reminded him. Again. \u201cI could have died the other day. I could have died today. In both cases I would have died without knowing the taste of you. What a shame that would be, since it\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever really wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he repeated, leaning...leaning... Regrettably, he stopped himself just before contact.</p><p>She tried not to scream in frustration. How close had she come to finally getting her wish? \u201cTell me why.\u201d So that she could obliterate each of the reasons.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need the distraction.\u201d At least he didn\u2019t move away. \u201cI don\u2019t need a woman. I don\u2019t need anything.\u201d</p><p>There was no way to refute that. Never had a man been more unwavering about remaining alone. So, rather than argue, she simply said, \u201cWell, I do need a distraction,\u201d and slid her hand up to his neck. She wouldn\u2019t step out of the zone this time; she would sprint.</p> <p>Determined, she jerked him down.</p><p>He could have resisted. He could have stopped her. He didn\u2019t. He allowed himself to fall on top of her. They remained like that for a long while, simply looking at each other, his body pinning her down, neither of them able to catch their breath.</p><p>\u201cAeron,\u201d she finally rasped.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she admitted, all the longing she felt wafting from the words.</p><p>\u201cI may be a fool, but I\u2019ve got it from here,\u201d he replied, and claimed her mouth with his own.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>SHE\u2019S WEAK, PRACTICALLY HUMAN. Worse than human, Aeron reminded himself as their tongues twined, but he couldn\u2019t make himself care. Later he would. Later he would regret, but for now, all he wanted was...her. Olivia. A woman his little Legion despised, a woman who had just gotten her ass handed to her\u2014although, if he were honest, he would admit that she\u2019d been holding her own until he\u2019d distracted her\u2014and a woman he would kick out of the fortress very soon.</p><p>The way she calmed and charmed Wrath made him uneasy, throwing him off his game. Even now, the demon purred, enjoying what was happening. Eager for what was to come.Foolish. Olivia was a distraction he couldn\u2019t afford. He hadn\u2019t lied about that. He couldn\u2019t waste time worrying about her, saving her when she got herself into trouble\u2014and she would. She wouldn\u2019t be able to help herself. The woman was determined to have \u201cfun,\u201d for the love of the gods.</p><p>Any other man would have been willing to help her with that, he thought next, hands falling beside her temples and fisting the sheet. Look at William. Sex-happy William. Bastard.</p><p>Mine. The angel is mine.</p><p>Wrath? Staking a claim? Laughable.</p><p>Not yours, and certainly not mine. But oh, how he wished otherwise.</p><p>In her new clothing, she\u2019d exposed luscious skin and dangerous curves. Both of which were sins in their own right, pure temptation no man could hope to resist. Not even him. She\u2019d wanted a kiss and there\u2019d been something inside him that had demanded he give it to her. For once, he hadn\u2019t had the strength to pull away. Had only been able to press their lips together, open her teeth with his tongue, and take. Take her sweetness, take her innocence. Take everything he could from the kiss.</p><p>And holy hell, the taste of her... She tasted of grapes, sweet with just a little tart, as her tongue tentatively sought his. Her nipples were hard and every few seconds she arched upward to brush her core against his erection. In contrast, her hands slid through his cropped hair and remained soft, her kiss gentle.</p><p>She would be a tender lover, just as he\u2019d always preferred.</p><p>He\u2019d never understood why some of the other warriors gravitated to women who scratched and bit and even hit during this most intimate of acts. Had never wanted to do so himself before. Why bring the violence of the battlefield into the bedroom? There was no reason good enough. Not to him.</p><p>Aeron\u2019s past lovers, the few he\u2019d allowed himself, had expected more intensity from him than he\u2019d been willing to give. Probably because he looked like a biker, was a confessed warrior and killer, and backed down from nothing. But he hadn\u2019t allowed them to push him into going faster or harder.</p><p>One, he was too strong and they too weak. He could too easily break them. Two, harder and faster might have roused his demon and Aeron refused to participate in a three-way with a creature he sometimes couldn\u2019t control. Again, he could break his partners, morphing from lover to punisher.</p><p>Except...if he were completely honest with himself, there was a desire, small though it was, to push Olivia past all boundaries, to hurtle her over the edge of her own sense of control, so much so that she would attack and plead and do anything necessary to reach her climax.</p><p>Wrath\u2019s purring increased in volume.</p><p>What was wrong with him? What was wrong with his demon? With this much interaction, Aeron should have feared hurting Olivia more than he\u2019d ever feared hurting another. He didn\u2019t. He deepened the kiss, taking more than she was probably willing to give.</p><p>Yes. More.</p><p>Wrath\u2019s voice was a whisper, but still it jarred him back into reality; he raised his head from Olivia. I\u2019m not edging into bloodlust. You should be quiet.</p><p>More!</p><p>Even though the demon had always been silent around Legion, his baby calming it much the same way Olivia did, Wrath had never wanted to kiss her.</p><p>Why was it responding this way to Olivia, then? An angel?</p><p>We need to slow down, he replied, not knowing what else to say.</p><p>Like a petulant child denied his favorite treat, the demon whined, More heaven. Please.</p><p>More...heaven? Aeron\u2019s eyes widened. Of course. To Wrath, Olivia must represent a place the demon would never have been welcome, making the unattainable seemingly within reach. Though, to be honest, Aeron had never before suspected that the demon wished to visit the home of the angels. Angels and demons were enemies, after all.</p><p>And maybe he was wrong, but nothing else explained the demon\u2019s...affection for her.</p><p>\u201cAeron?\u201d Her eyelids cracked open, her lashes thick and black, the perfect frame for those magnificent baby blues. Her lips were wet and red, and she licked them slowly. \u201cYour eyes...your pupils...but you\u2019re not angry.\u201d</p><p>What about his pupils? \u201cNo, I\u2019m not angry.\u201d Why would she think so?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re...aroused, yes?\u201d Those lips curved into a wanton grin, saving him from having to reply. \u201cSo why\u2019d you stop? Am I doing it wrong? Give me another chance, please, and I promise I\u2019ll learn the way of it.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back a bit more and blinked down at her. \u201cThis is your first kiss?\u201d He\u2019d known that. I don\u2019t know what to do, she\u2019d said earlier. But the truth hadn\u2019t really hit him until now. Angels remained utterly innocent, even in this? No wonder Bianka had chosen to linger in the sky with Lysander. This was...intoxicating.</p><p>Olivia nodded. Then, surprisingly, she offered him another grin. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t tell? You thought I was experienced?\u201d</p><p>Not entirely, but he didn\u2019t want to spoil her excitement. Plus, he liked her inexperience a little too much. He liked being her first, her only. Liked the possessiveness now flooding and consuming him.</p><p>A possessiveness that was wrong on so many levels. \u201cPerhaps we should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it again,\u201d she rushed out. \u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>Innocence and eagerness, wrapped in such a pretty package. Oh, yes. Intoxicating. \u201cNot what I was going to say. Perhaps we should stop.\u201d Before he introduced her to far more than a kiss.</p><p>Before he introduced himself\u2014and Wrath\u2014to heaven. A heaven they might never want to leave. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOnly this time,\u201d she added, as if he hadn\u2019t spoken, \u201cI\u2019ll be on top. I\u2019ve always wanted to try that. Well, since I met you.\u201d</p><p>She was stronger than she appeared and managed to shove him to his back, cool cotton pressing into his bare skin. Without awaiting permission, she straddled his waist. Her skirt was so short it rode up her thighs and gave him a forbidden peek at her panties. They were blue this time, like her shirt, and tiny. So very tiny.</p><p>His mouth watered and he found his hands on her knees, pushing them farther apart and rubbing her against his erection before he could stop himself. Sweet heaven. Damn, damn, damn. Heaven. He shouldn\u2019t be doing this.</p> <p>More.</p><p>Moaning, she tilted her head back, and the silky length of her hair tickled his stomach. Her breasts arched forward, her nipples still hard and visible through her shirt. Clearly, she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra.</p><p>That did not delight him.</p><p>Her gaze met his, burning him to his soul. \u201cI wasn\u2019t kidding when I told you I needed a distraction. Legion\u2019s attack reminded me of what the other demons did to me. And I want to forget, Aeron. I need to forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did they do to you?\u201d he found himself asking, even though he\u2019d once told himself he didn\u2019t care to know.</p> <p>Some of the passion-haze left her, dulling those pretty irises, and she shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it. I want to kiss.\u201d</p><p>She leaned down, but he turned his head away. \u201cTell me.\u201d Finding out was suddenly more important than finding pleasure.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her lips dipped into a pout.</p><p>\u201cTalk.\u201d He would learn the truth and he would avenge her. Simple as that.</p><p>Wrath snarled in agreement.</p><p>A growl escaped the angel, surprising them both. \u201cWho would have thought a man would rather converse than do...other things.\u201d</p> <p>His teeth ground together. Stubborn woman. \u201cEven if we kiss, I will not fu\u2014sleep with you,\u201d he said. Lysander\u2019s warning chose that moment to echo in his head. Do not soil her. I will bury you and all those you love.</p><p>He stiffened. How could he have forgotten such a threat?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask you to sleep with me, now did I?\u201d How prim and proper she sounded. \u201cLike I said, I just wanted another kiss.\u201d</p><p>Maybe that was true. Maybe it wasn\u2019t. Yes, her voice claimed it was, but he refused to believe it. Didn\u2019t want to believe it. Not that he would ever admit such a thing aloud. If he were to sleep with her as she so clearly craved, she would expect more. Women always expected more, whether he pleased them or not. And more he couldn\u2019t give her. Not just because of her powerful mentor. Complications, he reminded himself. He didn\u2019t need them.</p><p>More!</p><p>\u201cIf I kiss you again,\u201d he said, thinking, shut up, shut the hell up, \u201cI won\u2019t hold you afterward.\u201d A kiss was not \u201cmore,\u201d he told himself. A kiss was not something that soiled. A kiss was just a kiss, and she was on top of him, for gods\u2019 sake. \u201cIt won\u2019t change anything between us.\u201d Best she understood that now. \u201cAlso, I\u2019ll expect you to tell me what was done to you.\u201d</p><p>Bargaining? Really? Way to resist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a confident, aggressive woman, so I\u2019m okay with the not changing anything between us thing,\u201d she said with a casual\u2014forced?\u2014shrug. \u201cCuddling isn\u2019t a top priority, anyway. But talking about what happened? I can\u2019t promise.\u201d</p> <p>Did this \u201cconfident\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d woman truly not care to burrow into his side and hold him tight once their lips parted? Did she truly want him for a kiss and nothing else? That delighted him. Truly. That did not disappoint him. Not even a little.</p><p>\u201cRight now, I just want to use your mouth and your body,\u201d she added with a blush. Not as confident as she seemed, perchance? \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll only rub against you a little bit. So if we\u2019re done with this conversation, I\u2019d like to get to it.\u201d</p><p>Despite his disappoint\u2014uh, utter delight\u2014that she was willing to kiss him without expecting anything else, fire sparked in his blood, caught and spread. Soon his veins were like rivers of lava, every muscle clenched and ready, burning. Use his body? Please, please, please.</p><p>I said more!</p><p>What an odd mix of innocence and hedonism she was.</p><p>What an odd mix of reluctance and enthusiasm he was.</p><p>He should stop this now, finally, before things spun out of control.</p><p>Control. Damn it. He needed to exercise some and act rationally, rather than talking himself into and out of being with her. Actually, he needed to talk himself\u2014and his demon\u2014out of it one final time and then leave.</p><p>\u201cAs you reminded me, you could have died today,\u201d he said darkly. Good. Nothing upset him more than thoughts of death. \u201cYou\u2019re easily breakable.\u201d Except that. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d He could only shake his head. Like the humans he always observed, she didn\u2019t seem to care. She wasn\u2019t on her knees, begging for more time, and obviously had no plans to do so. His jaw clenched painfully. She should be begging.</p><p>\u201cAre we done chatting now?\u201d she asked, blush reigniting. \u201cIf not, I guess I could touch myself some more. I liked it before. Maybe I\u2019ll like it again.\u201d Without waiting for his response, she cupped her breasts and moaned. \u201cOh, yes. I like.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps she wasn\u2019t blushing, after all. Perhaps she was simply flushed with pleasure.</p><p>He gulped. \u201cNo, we aren\u2019t done chatting. Why aren\u2019t you afraid of dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything and everyone has an end,\u201d she said, carnal ministrations never ceasing. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re going to be killed soon, and though I loathe the thought, you don\u2019t see me crying about that, either. I know what will happen, and I accept what cannot be changed. I\u2019m trying to live while I can. While we can. Dwelling on the bad is what destroys all hint of joy.\u201d</p><p>He felt a muscle tick beneath his eye. \u201cI will not be killed.\u201d</p><p>She stilled, some of the sparkle fading from her expression. He tried not to mourn the loss. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you?\u201d she said. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to beat the angel sent to slay you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me something else, then. You gave up your immortality for fun and immediately ran to me. That means you expect me to supply this fun. Why would you do that, why would you give up so much and rely on me so heavily if I\u2019m to be destroyed?\u201d</p><p>She offered him a sad smile. \u201cI would rather be with someone a short time than not at all.\u201d</p><p>Her claim reminded him of what Paris had said the other night, and he bristled. He wasn\u2019t wrong in this. They were. \u201cYou sound like a friend of mine. A very foolish man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen silly me for not choosing him instead. Better a fool who plays the game than one who remains on the sidelines.\u201d</p><p>He bared his teeth in a scowl. Don\u2019t even think about being with someone else, he wanted to roar.</p><p>Wrath, too, erupted. Not at Olivia, but at Paris. The demon flashed images of the warrior\u2019s head on a platter\u2014minus his body.</p><p>Aeron instantly sobered. Oh, no, you don\u2019t. You will leave Paris alone.</p><p>She\u2019s mine.</p><p>No, mine, he snapped, then realized what he\u2019d done. I mean, she belongs to neither of us. I\u2019ve told you that. Now will you please shut up?</p><p>\u201cAre we done chatting now?\u201d One of Olivia\u2019s fingertips traced down the flatness of her stomach and circled her navel. \u201cOr shall we make this conversation more interesting?\u201d She nibbled her bottom lip, considering. \u201cOh, I know what we can discuss. Can people really die of pleasure?\u201d</p><p>Oh, hell, no. She hadn\u2019t just asked that.</p><p>Do not soil her. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know.\u201d He sat up, meaning to toss her aside and leave her here. Alone. Aroused, but alone. The desire to murder his friend had done nothing to temper his need, nor had the reminder of Lysander\u2019s threat. Retreat was his only other option.</p><p>\u201cWell, you might not, but I promise you I\u2019ll find out.\u201d</p><p>He froze. Just how far would this angel go to discover the truth? As the question drifted through his mind, his cock pulsed. The image of her splayed out, her own hand between her legs, fingers sinking deep, consumed him. Dear...gods...</p><p>\u201cNo. You will behave yourself.\u201d The words croaked from him. \u201cNow, I have to go.\u201d</p><p>Stay! Wrath commanded.</p><p>Gods help him, he did. He stayed. As easily as if he\u2019d been chained to the bed, his fight gone before it had time to fortify him.</p><p>\u201cFine. But I really wish\u2014 No. No!\u201d she repeated more forcefully. \u201cYou can go when we\u2019re done. Only then.\u201d Olivia\u2019s arms wound around his neck, her hands firm against his hair, her nails sinking into his scalp. \u201cI know what to do now.\u201d She jerked his mouth to hers and her tongue instantly plunged deep.</p><p>Oh, yes. A quick study.</p><p>Her lips slanted over his, their teeth scraping. The heat...the wetness. Consuming, destroying his resolve. Everything he needed, everything he ached for. Chasing every thought but one from his head: finish.</p><p>Yes. Yes! More.</p><p>She moaned, and he swallowed the decadent sound. And when she rubbed against him, he could feel how damp she was, even through his pants. His gentleness\u2014gone. His tentativeness\u2014abolished. He arched up to meet her. When that wasn\u2019t enough, he clasped her ass and forced her to move faster, harder. Deeper.</p><p>\u201cI want to touch you everywhere,\u201d she rasped as she plundered. \u201cI want to taste you everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe first. I\u2014\u201d No. No, no, no. Do not soil her, do not soil her.</p><p>She nipped her way to his chin, then lower, sucking on his neck to ease the sting.</p><p>Yes, please. Soil her all day, all night.</p><p>More, Wrath demanded again.</p><p>More. Yes. More\u2014 No! Damn it. Threaten her, Wrath. That\u2019ll send me fleeing the room, surely.</p><p>More.</p><p>Is that the only word you know?</p><p>More, damn you.</p><p>Aeron snarled. No one wanted to cooperate today.</p><p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d He rolled Olivia over, pinning her down again, meaning to stop the madness but licking the hollow between her neck and shoulder instead. That hammering pulse looked too delicious to ignore. Foolish man. Stupid demon. Beautiful female. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hands seeking of their own accord, he kneaded her breasts. Fucking mistake. They were perfect, her nipples harder than he\u2019d realized. Keep the conversation going. Pull those hands away. \u201cI must be everything your kind despises.\u201d After all, his evil deeds were etched over his body for the entire world to see.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re both the goodness I know and the exhilaration I crave.\u201d She wrapped her legs around him, closing any lingering hint of distance. \u201cWhat\u2019s not to like about that?\u201d</p><p>Shit, shit, shit. Another perfect fit. \u201cI\u2019m not good.\u201d Not compared to her. Not compared to anyone, really. If she knew half the things he\u2019d done or half the things he would do, she would be running from him. \u201cHow can I be to someone like you? You\u2019re an angel.\u201d An angel who tempted him like no other.</p><p>Heaven.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fallen. Remember? And I\u2019m a little tired of hearing you say my kind and someone like me. It\u2019s irritating. And do you know how hard it is to irritate an angel? Even one of the fallen?\u201d Her hands roved over his back, over the slits that hid his wings. She probed inside, found the delicate membranes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if my chastisement hurts your feelings, but\u2014 No. I\u2019m not sorry!\u201d She caressed.</p><p>A roar of bliss parted his lips. He had to reach over his head and grab the headboard to keep himself from clawing or punching something, so drunk did the sudden influx of pleasure make him. Damned. He was damned. There would be no resisting now.</p><p>Sweat beaded over his skin, and his blood heated yet another degree. No one had ever... That was the first time anyone had... How had she known to do that?</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>More, Wrath agreed.</p><p>Again Olivia\u2019s fingertips grazed his hidden wings. Again he roared at the bliss, unable to catch his breath. With that first touch, his thoughts had splintered. With the second, they had aligned, an echo of his need. Finish.</p><p>More than a kiss? Hell, yes. He would give it to her.</p><p>More, more, more.</p><p>Olivia raised her head and flicked her tongue over one of his nipples. \u201cMmm, I\u2019ve always wanted to do that.\u201d She licked again. And again. But soon that wasn\u2019t enough, and she nibbled on the hard little bud with her teeth.</p><p>Aeron let her bite him. Something he\u2019d never allowed another woman to do. He was too lost to stop her, and part of him didn\u2019t want to stop her. Part of him, like his demon, only wanted more. Hell, all of him did. Control be damned.</p><p>Her attentions turned to his other nipple. There was no licking this time, only the biting. He was surprised to find himself leaning into the sting, anticipating, eager. To his surprise, the action wasn\u2019t a reminder of Wrath\u2019s vengeance sprees, as he\u2019d always assumed it would be. It wasn\u2019t even a reminder of his first time with a woman, as he\u2019d also assumed. A time he\u2019d rather forget. It was a declaration of his partner\u2019s intense, uncontrollable excitement.</p><p>And still he wanted harder. Faster.</p><p>More!</p><p>He released the headboard and rolled once again, placing Olivia on top. She nipped her way down his stomach, her nails scraping at his skin, her raspy pants echoing in his ears. He gripped the hem of her shirt and jerked the material over her head, freeing those magnificent breasts. He\u2019d only touched them before, the shirt a hated barrier, but now he saw nipples like frosted plums. Hungry, he was hungry. He shifted his gaze before he lifted her, devoured. Her stomach was beautifully soft.</p><p>Oh, yes, soft, he thought as he splayed his fingers on her warm skin. His tattooed hands were almost obscene on so delicate a woman, but he couldn\u2019t force himself to pull away. Where\u2019s your prized strength now, huh?</p><p>Gone, like his sense of control.</p><p>Her fingers wrapped around his and she stared down at the contrast they made. Innocence and wickedness.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d she gasped.</p> <p>She thought so?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get it pierced, I think,\u201d she said, tracing a fingertip around his hand.</p><p>His gaze shot to her passion-glazed face. \u201cGet what pierced?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy navel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Unsoiled. A gorgeous jewel would sparkle against her skin and draw his eyes constantly. Make his mouth water. Make him want to tongue her there. Then move lower. Soiling. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to do that. You\u2019re an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFallen.\u201d Her grin was slow and wicked. \u201cI thought we were done chatting. Especially since we were doing something I liked very, very much and I want to do it again. Tasting.\u201d She scooted backward on his legs and licked at his navel, tongue swirling on some of his tattoos.</p><p>Groaning, Aeron relaxed on the mattress. That naughty tongue was hot, her teeth still sharp, but damn if he wasn\u2019t already addicted to the feel of them. More. A plea from him this time. Maybe they all had been.</p><p>Until...her fingers worked at the button on his jeans and reality intruded. You\u2019ll finish. He couldn\u2019t allow it, he reminded himself. Too much was at stake.</p><p>Hated reality.</p><p>Rational. Be rational. He grabbed her wrists to stop her. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d Did that slurred tone belong to him?</p><p>\u201cI want to see your\u2014\u201d she licked her lips, cheeks coloring again \u201c\u2014your penis.\u201d</p><p>He nearly choked on his tongue. Unsoiled. Rational.</p><p>\u201cThen I want to suck on it,\u201d she added, a slight tremor to the words.</p><p>Dear...gods...he thought again. Someone needed to tell Lysander she was halfway soiled already\u2014in the most delicious way\u2014and it wouldn\u2019t be Aeron\u2019s fault if he completed the job. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing that to me.\u201d</p><p>Fool!</p><p>Lookie there. His demon knew another word.</p><p>She traced one of those naughty fingertips up his stomach and around his nipple, her hand trembling just as her voice had. \u201cBut I want to. So badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an angel,\u201d he reminded them both for the thousandth time, shaking his head for emphasis. And he might be a killer, but he wasn\u2019t a debaucher.</p><p>You could be. The demon?</p><p>Gods, he wanted to be.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, again for everyone\u2019s benefit. His, Olivia\u2019s and Wrath\u2019s. Now go back to your corner, he shouted to the demon. You aren\u2019t welcome here anymore. Even though Wrath had been on its best behavior.</p><p>\u201cArgh! How many times do I have to tell you? I\u2019ve fallen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I won\u2019t be responsible for your ruin.\u201d</p><p>Eyes narrowing, she slammed a fist into his chest. \u201cFine. As a confident, aggressive woman, I know I can find someone else. I wanted it to be you, but as I\u2019ve learned the past few days, we don\u2019t always get what we want. William flirted with me, I think, and it\u2019s clear that he likes to have...you know. Sex.\u201d</p><p>When she lifted from him, as if she truly meant to follow through with her threat\u2014and perhaps she did, the determined little wildcat, despite the fact that she\u2019d faltered on the word sex, proving she wasn\u2019t quite as confident and aggressive as she wanted him to believe\u2014a snarl of rage erupted from him and he grabbed her by the arm. He tossed her back onto the mattress.</p><p>William would not be touching her. Ever.</p><p>When she stopped bouncing, he covered her with the full measure of his weight. \u201cJust because I won\u2019t let you do things to me doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t do things to you. I\u2019m already ruined.\u201d As he spoke, he slid his hand up her thigh. Soft...warm...</p><p>Mine.</p><p>Another claim from Wrath, but he couldn\u2019t protest this time. Automatically her knees parted. Warm? No. Hot. He tunneled past her panties to the heart of her. She was perfect and wet, dripping. His thumb, shaking now, pressed into her sweet spot.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped. \u201cYes. That\u2019s so good...just what I\u2019d imagined...\u201d Her eyes closed and she dug her nails into his back.</p><p>Away from his wings, but even that was a stimulant to him. He meant to ease one finger inside her, but that gasp...her praise...her caress... His desire was once again spiraling to new heights, and he actually shoved inside her. Careful. She didn\u2019t seem to mind, though. No, she seemed to enjoy.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A moan this time. Her knee rubbed against his hip. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>Helpless but to obey\u2014would it always be so with her?\u2014he sank in a second finger. She writhed and thrashed and he thought she might even have drawn his blood. His cock wasn\u2019t free, thank the gods, or in that moment, he would have pounded inside her.</p><p>Scratch that. His cock wasn\u2019t free, curse the gods, or in that moment he would have pounded inside her.</p><p>Inside her. He wanted inside her so bad.</p><p>After this, after she erupted in his arms, screaming and begging and praising his name, he had to get rid of her. She caused too many problems, fogged up his common sense, distracted him.</p><p>Unsoiled, he reminded himself. Take her into town unsoiled.</p><p>Keep her, Wrath whined.</p><p>I told you to be quiet, he snapped. He didn\u2019t need to war with his demon as well as with his own needs.</p><p>And why was Wrath so vocal? he wondered again. Over a female, no less, rather than someone\u2019s punishment. Yes, he\u2019d already figured out the demon liked what Olivia represented. Heaven. Odd though that was. But this insistence...</p><p>Was the demon more like him than he\u2019d realized? Both liking and hating what they did, how they killed. He\u2019d always assumed the demon enjoyed the blood-crazes\u2014and the ensuing results. But what if Wrath had always been as helpless as Aeron? As desperate for absolution?</p><p>\u201cAeron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he gritted out, Olivia\u2019s voice drawing him out of his head.</p><p>\u201cYou stilled,\u201d she said through her panting. \u201cI need more. Do continue, please.\u201d</p><p>Reverting to her sense of propriety. Enchanting. But he didn\u2019t want to hear her ask him for more; it only weakened his resolve. And he didn\u2019t want to hear Wrath, either.</p><p>He silenced them the only way he could. He pressed his mouth into Olivia\u2019s and kissed her.</p><p>He meant to gentle things, as he was used to, as he could handle, but she was having none of that and lifted to meet him, her tongue dancing over his, her teeth sliding against his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Soon she was writhing against him again, moaning. Even reaching between their bodies, tunneling inside his pants and gripping his cock. He hissed in pleasure, in pain. She wasn\u2019t gentle about that, either, and though she didn\u2019t know the way of it, her motions a little too jerky, her touch was so welcome he found himself moving into her hold. Hard, fast, uncontrollable.</p><p>A knock sounded at the door.</p><p>He didn\u2019t still. He couldn\u2019t. She\u2019d thumbed the slit at the head of his cock, spreading moisture, and in the span of a few seconds, he\u2019d catapulted past the point of return. Reality would not intrude this time.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so...just a little...more...\u201d Her grip tightened. \u201cAeron.\u201d</p><p>Again he jerked in pleasure. He had to cut back a roar as another knock sounded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare stop, either!\u201d Olivia screeched, then her tongue was back inside his mouth, her nails all over him, her knees gripping his sides.</p><p>In and out he pumped his fingers. Her grip tightened even more, pulling his skin, but gods, the burn was good. So damn good. And when his thumb found her clitoris again, she screamed, loud and long and with so much pleasure a wave of pride flooded him\u2014and with the pride came a release of his own.</p> <p>A release so complete he didn\u2019t care that he was jetting seed all over her stomach. Didn\u2019t care that he was shouting profanities and slamming his free hand into the headboard and cracking the wood. Didn\u2019t care that what he\u2019d done could damn him in Lysander\u2019s eyes.</p><p>As a third knock reverberated, Aeron collapsed on top of Olivia, his strength utterly depleted. Panting, sweating, he rolled to his side so that he wouldn\u2019t squish her.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said after a moment, sagging into the mattress. \u201cNow I can cross one item off my To Do list. Good job, and thank you. I know other men enjoy cuddling, but I believe you mentioned earlier that you don\u2019t want to do that, so...\u201d</p><p>Dismissed, he thought, eyes widening. Just like that.</p><p>Hell. No. He was just leaning toward her, meaning to jerk her into his arms and force her to cuddle him, when yet another knock reverberated. Scowling now, frustrated, he drew the sheet around her, popped to his feet and stalked to the door. Someone was about to die.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p> <p>WHO WAS HERE?</p><p>A naked Aeron threw open the door, and Olivia watched him unabashedly. That beautiful butterfly flew at the top of his back and she had touched it. In fact, his skin was welted and bleeding from where she\u2019d scratched him. Perhaps that should have embarrassed her. It didn\u2019t. She was proud. She\u2019d marked him. Marked the man she lusted after. And he had responded; he had climaxed. She wanted to do it again. Only, she wanted to do more. Go all the way.Stupid intruders.</p><p>Who was here and what did they want? If it wasn\u2019t life-and-death, Olivia hoped they fell down the stairs later.</p><p>The violent thought, so unlike her, gave her pause. Or maybe such violence wasn\u2019t unlike her. She was new and improved, after all.</p><p>And the new and improved Olivia might\u2014might\u2014have gotten Aeron to change his mind about that cuddling by subtly mentioning how much others enjoyed it. And, to be honest, cuddling sounded more delightful by the second. Warmth, strength and raw sex appeal, all wrapped around her.</p><p>Maybe next time. If there was a next time. He\u2019d seemed so sure this would be a one-time deal.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Aeron barked. His big body blocked her view, so Olivia couldn\u2019t see who it was.</p><p>\u201cHeard some shouting.\u201d Cameo stepped to the side for a peek inside the room, finally answering Olivia\u2019s unspoken question. The female warrior spotted Olivia\u2019s disarray, and her mouth dropped open in astonishment.</p> <p>Olivia just grinned and waved. She wasn\u2019t embarrassed by what had happened with Aeron. Well, not much. She was mostly jubilant. She\u2019d given up everything she\u2019d ever known to be here and experience the glories of the flesh, so inhibitions weren\u2019t going to be tolerated.</p><p>Besides, over the years, she\u2019d seen humans do all manner of things. Sex, drugs. So much good, so much bad. What she\u2019d done had been beautiful. There was no shame in it.</p><p>\u201cYou look well,\u201d Olivia told her.</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d Had Cameo\u2019s voice not been so sorrowful, Olivia thought she might have heard laughter in the undertone.</p><p>\u201cEyes on me, Cam,\u201d Aeron said, clearly irritated for some reason. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>Cameo faced him, lips twitching. \u201cTorin watched some footage he recorded last night and caught a glimpse of Nightmares. Far as he could tell, she went into a building and never came out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Shadow Girl. Olivia told us she\u2019s possessed by the demon of Nightmares. Anyway, we\u2019re going into town to, uh\u2014\u201d her gaze flicked pointedly to Olivia \u201c\u2014chat with her. You in or out?\u201d</p><p>Aeron stiffened, and there was a beat of silence. Then he said, \u201cIn,\u201d and glanced over his shoulder at Olivia. \u201cDon\u2019t get comfortable. You\u2019re coming with us. While we\u2019re out there, we\u2019ll find someplace for you to stay until you decide where you want to live permanently.\u201d</p><p>What? He still planned to get rid of her? After everything they\u2019d done? Sure, she\u2019d told him it wouldn\u2019t change anything, but that had been before it changed everything. That one little taste of pleasure wouldn\u2019t be enough for her.</p><p>You were assertive before, in this bed. You can be that way again. \u201cSorry, but no can do. I\u2019d probably almost die again,\u201d she said, and she almost grinned when his eyes widened. The man had a serious problem with thoughts of her death, expecting it at every corner. \u201cI think I\u2019ll stay here.\u201d And you\u2019ll like it, she projected to him. Some people didn\u2019t know what they needed to achieve happiness. Clearly, Aeron was one of them. She\u2019d just have to instruct him, as she\u2019d already planned.</p><p>He massaged the back of his neck. \u201cWe talked about this, Olivia. You can\u2019t stay here. No matter what happened between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She threw her legs over the side of the bed and stood, dragging the sheet with her.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going into town with me?\u201d he asked, obviously suspicious. And angry and relieved. What a weird combination of emotions.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Placing one foot in front of the other while her knees trembled was difficult, but she managed to do it. Without falling. She brushed past Aeron\u2014oh, sweet Deity, his heat, his strength\u2014and smiled as she did the same to Cameo, who winked at her.</p><p>She paused in the hallway as a thought occurred to her.</p><p>Glancing at Aeron over her shoulder, she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to explore your fortress. Oh, and, Aeron. When you fail to find Nightmares, whose name is Scarlet, by the way, please don\u2019t come home and take your bad mood out on me. Unless you want me to kiss it better. That would be acceptable.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for his response, but meandered around the corner.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d he called.</p><p>Ignoring him, she continued on. She had a feeling he wanted to argue with her. Her body was still humming with threads of the pleasure he\u2019d given her and arguing would ruin that.</p><p>\u201cOlivia! You\u2019re practically naked.\u201d</p><p>Naked? She stilled, glanced down at the sheet draped over her bare breasts and gulped. Partial nudity was fine when she was with Aeron, but not so fine when she would most likely run into others. And that had nothing to do with a lack of confidence, she assured herself.</p><p>Being with Aeron had helped defeat the memory of what had happened in hell, yes. But then, nothing about the two experiences had been similar. Aeron had sought pleasure; the demons had sought pain. Still. Seeing lust in someone else\u2019s eye might bring those memories roaring back to life.</p><p>With a sigh, she rushed back inside the room, bypassing Aeron and his infuriated expression without comment. Cameo had already wandered off. Olivia dropped the sheet, grabbed her shirt and pulled the fabric over her head. Thankfully, she was still wearing her skirt and panties.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d she said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Not for what we\u2019re about to do. And yes, I\u2019m saying you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>She closed the distance between them, rose to her tiptoes and kissed his cheek. \u201cSee you later. And please be careful.\u201d Down the hall she meandered again.</p><p>\u201cOlivia.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him, attention riveted by the many doorways ahead of her. She peeked her head into the first, unsure of what she\u2019d find. Of course. A workout room. She should have guessed, but as many times as she\u2019d secretly been here, her focus had been on Aeron.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d he called, and this time he sounded resigned. \u201cFine. Stay. Whatever. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Liar. At least she hoped he was lying.</p><p>The second room, she saw, was empty. The third, she heard voices floating from before she reached the doorway. Not allowing herself to be dissuaded by fear or uncertainty, she peeked inside.</p><p>It was a bedroom, like Aeron\u2019s, only there was no pink or lace. Dark walls, metal furniture rather than wood, and of all things, a karaoke station in the corner. A woman was seated at the side of a large bed, reading to a man who rested atop the mattress.</p><p>Olivia must have made a noise because that man\u2019s gaze lifted and landed on her. He tried to rise, but the woman protested. \u201cGideon. What are you doing? Lie down!\u201d</p><p>Gideon. Olivia racked her brain. Keeper of Lies?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m resting,\u201d he croaked out. \u201cWe\u2019re alone.\u201d</p><p>Oh, yes. He was indeed the keeper of Lies, unable to tell a single truth without suffering severe pain. He was also very, very cute, with blue hair, electric eyes and a pierced eyebrow. But he was clearly injured. White bandages were wrapped around his wrists where his hands should have been.</p><p>Confident. Aggressive. \u201cSorry to interrupt. I was just...in the neighborhood.\u201d Truth. \u201cI\u2019m Olivia,\u201d she said, waving. Though this demon raised her hackles as Torin had done, she didn\u2019t scream at him to leave or run away herself. Before, she\u2019d been injured and lost to those terrible memories. Now, her body was stronger\u2014or as strong as a human body could be. She could handle this. \u201cI\u2019m with Aeron.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Which wasn\u2019t a lie. He was one of the reasons she\u2019d come here. She\u2019d just kissed him while lying in a bed and oh, her heart had yet to settle over that. She\u2019d never seen him do that with another female.</p><p>Just like that, her mind immersed itself in what had happened. Wow. Just...wow. While his body was hard as a rock, his mouth was soft as a rose petal. His hands had moved all over her, she\u2019d rubbed herself on his massive erection, and those big fingers had pushed inside her. The pleasure...the heat...the surprising abandon...she\u2019d never experienced anything like it.</p><p>Now she knew. You really could die from pleasure.</p> <p>He\u2019d tasted of mint, sweet and spicy; together, they\u2019d been the perfect aphrodisiac, overwhelming her senses. Completion had become her sole source of survival.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the angel,\u201d the woman said with a welcoming grin, tugging her from her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cYes. Fallen, but yes.\u201d</p><p>Gideon relaxed against his pillows. \u201cWonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay no attention to him. He\u2019s grumpy from boredom. I\u2019m Ashlyn, by the way.\u201d Ashlyn had golden hair, golden eyes, and looked as delicate as an iris. \u201cMaddox\u2019s wife.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaddox, keeper of Violence,\u201d Olivia said. A giant of a man with black hair, violet eyes identical to Aeron\u2019s and a seemingly untamable temper. \u201cYou\u2019ve married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn our own private ceremony,\u201d Ashlyn replied with a blush. She stood. \u201cHe\u2019s not so bad, though, I promise.\u201d Her hands smoothed over her rounded belly. \u201cHe\u2019s a sweetie once you get to know him.\u201d</p><p>Olivia couldn\u2019t help herself. She strode forward and placed her own hands on that belly. Pregnant females had always drawn her, for she\u2019d always known she would never bear children herself\u2014another secret wish of hers. Angels were created, not born, so even if she\u2019d experienced physical desire with another of her kind, she wouldn\u2019t have conceived.</p><p>Now that she was human...perhaps there was a possibility.</p><p>With Aeron? A girl could hope. For a moment, she pictured what children of theirs would look like. They wouldn\u2019t be born with all those tattoos, of course, and that was a shame, but they might have his beautiful violet eyes, and even his wings. Everyone should experience the joys of flight, if only once. Perhaps their children would even have Aeron\u2019s grit and determination, driving her mad while at the same time enchanting her.</p><p>She sighed, returning her attention to the task at hand.</p> <p>\u201cThey are strong, your twins,\u201d she said, knowing mothers welcomed such news. \u201cFire and ice. You\u2019ll have your hands full, keeping them out of trouble, but you\u2019ll be happier for it.\u201d</p><p>Ashlyn\u2019s jaw dropped and for a long while, she simply blinked up at the taller Olivia. \u201cT-twins? How do you know I\u2019m having twins?\u201d</p><p>Oh, no. She\u2019d ruined the surprise, hadn\u2019t she? \u201cSensing who grows in a woman\u2019s womb is a gift all angels possess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat...that just can\u2019t be.\u201d Her skin was paling by the second, even becoming tinted with green. \u201cThere\u2019s only one being inside me. I mean, I\u2019m progressing normally. Right?\u201d</p><p>How much to tell her? Only enough to calm her, perhaps. \u201cNo. You\u2019re progressing slowly. Your children are immortal and require a much longer gestation. But don\u2019t worry. As you promised me, I now promise you. Both your son and your daughter are healthy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA son? A daughter?\u201d</p><p>Great. She\u2019d ruined another surprise.</p><p>With a shaky hand, Ashlyn brushed a lock of honey-colored hair from her face and hooked it behind her ear. \u201cI need to lie down. I need to call Maddox. I\u2014I\u2014\u201d Her wild gaze swung to Gideon. \u201cWould you mind terribly if\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cI would mind.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled heavily. \u201cThank you.\u201d As if she were lost in a trance, the pretty Ashlyn padded from the room, not sparing Olivia another glance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Olivia called. For more than one reason. Now she was alone with Lies. A situation in which she had never thought to find herself. Injured as he was, however, she couldn\u2019t leave him. \u201cWould you, uh, like me to continue the story?\u201d she asked. Not waiting for a reply, she lifted the book Ashlyn had left behind\u2014ohhh, a romance novel, how decadent!\u2014and claimed the woman\u2019s seat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love for you to read to me,\u201d he said. \u201cYour voice is not...creepy.\u201d</p><p>Meaning he wouldn\u2019t and it was. Rejected.</p><p>She fanned the book\u2019s pages, doing her best to hide her disappointment. \u201cWhat you\u2019re hearing is a layer of truth. There\u2019s nothing I can do about it. Well, except lie, but that\u2019s not something I want to do. They taste horrible. Plus, they\u2019re too complicated. Feelings get hurt, fights erupt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d know nothing about that. Lies are awesome,\u201d he said, but she knew he was agreeing with her. There was envy in his tone. \u201cI wish...nothing. I wish nothing.\u201d</p><p>Poor guy. He must wish for a lot of things. \u201cSo. Do you still want me to leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Progress. \u201cCan I read now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said again. \u201cI\u2019d rather not talk.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Still no romance novel for her, then. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout you. I have no desire to know why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can help me?\u201d she asked hopefully. From fear to need? And so quickly. Perhaps that proved the depths of her desperation to succeed.</p><p>\u201cSure. Why not?\u201d</p><p>Choosing to ignore the lie\u2014perhaps he merely thought he couldn\u2019t help her, but would surprise himself\u2014Olivia told him about her decision to fall, what she hoped to gain and the progress she\u2019d made with Aeron. It was nice, having an unbiased bystander to share with. Someone who wouldn\u2019t judge her.</p><p>\u201cSo you hate him, then?\u201d the warrior asked, and she knew that he meant love.</p><p>Love. Did she love Aeron? \u201cNo. Yes. Maybe.\u201d She still didn\u2019t know. \u201cI think about him all the time. I want to be with him, give myself to him fully. You know, sexually,\u201d she added with a blush, in case he didn\u2019t understand. Confident. \u201cHe said he wouldn\u2019t have sex with me, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart little shit, our Aeron.\u201d Gideon\u2019s grin was slow to form, but wicked and sultry because of it. \u201cListen, here\u2019s a little unhelpful advice. Don\u2019t consider sneaking into his bedroom tonight\u2014and don\u2019t make lots of noise so he doesn\u2019t kill you, thinking you\u2019re the enemy. Oh, and don\u2019t be naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent suggestions, thank you,\u201d she said, brightening. She kicked her feet onto the bed. She still wore her boots, and the black leather glinted in the light. \u201cMen do like their nakedness, I\u2019ve noticed. Aeron didn\u2019t want anyone else to see my...breasts.\u201d</p><p>The new and improved her could still be embarrassed, she realized.</p><p>\u201cHow wrong you are. Oh, and, Olive? In that position, I can\u2019t see your panties,\u201d he said, clearly amused.</p><p>Confident, you are confident. \u201cDo you like them?\u201d</p><p>He blinked in surprise, clearly having expected her to change positions. \u201cI hate them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d That wasn\u2019t embarrassing, she decided; that was empowering. \u201cWould you like them as a souvenir? Since I plan to take your advice and crawl into Aeron\u2019s bed naked, I\u2019m not going to need them anymore.\u201d</p><p>Gideon laughed outright. \u201cNope. I wouldn\u2019t. I would hate to have them as a souvenir. And not just because I\u2019m sure Aeron will be thrilled to know I have his girlfriend\u2019s panties.\u201d</p><p>Aeron\u2019s girlfriend. A lie, from Gideon\u2019s point of view, but she could have melted into a puddle. \u201cThen they\u2019re yours. I\u2019ll give them to you before I take off.\u201d</p><p>That earned her another laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t like you at all, boy. Not at all.\u201d</p><p>She beamed. \u201cDitto. So now that I\u2019ve told you about me, tell me about him. Aeron. I mean, I know who he is, but I know nothing about his past. I want to understand him. Reach him. Help him stop worrying about my eventual death.\u201d And accept his own.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Meaning sure thing.</p><p>Gideon shifted on the bed. A lock of blue hair had lodged into the headboard, and it pulled with his movement. He grimaced, reached up, but was unable to clasp a single strand with his bandaged wrists. His frustrated growl propelled her into action.</p><p>She dropped her legs, leaned forward and gently smoothed the hair free. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered gruffly.</p><p>\u201cGood. I like the blue, by the way. Maybe I\u2019ll dye mine.\u201d She pushed the thought to the back of her mind, to be considered later. Along with that navel piercing. Right now, she wanted to learn about Aeron. Who he\u2019d been, what had shaped him.</p><p>\u201cForgetting Aeron...where do you not want me to start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you warriors were kicked from the heavens into ancient Greece. I\u2019ve heard the stories about the torment you caused, slaying innocent humans, torturing, raiding, pillaging, destroying everything you encountered, and so on and so forth.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou heard wrong. We had total control of our demons and weren\u2019t lost to bloodlust. And when we did finally lose control, the guilt of what we\u2019d done, well, it was minimal.\u201d</p><p>Guilt. A terrible burden to carry. And from what she\u2019d seen of these Lords, they carried far more than any one person should ever have to bear. They deserved peace, she decided. Once and for all.</p><p>\u201cAeron wasn\u2019t a warrior,\u201d Gideon continued, \u201cand yet his actions, even when unwarranted, didn\u2019t torment him\u2014though I was always sure he hated what he did a little too much and loved himself for it. Even still, he did the least amount of work, making the rest of us do all the killing to protect the god king.\u201d</p><p>Olivia quickly translated Gideon\u2019s meaning. Aeron had sometimes loved his job a little too much and had hated himself for it, but he\u2019d also loved his friends, so he\u2019d done their work, too, sparing them some of the burden, which had probably been torturous for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Guilt, she thought again. Even then, he had carried massive amounts of it. He had enjoyed hurting those who\u2019d hurt others, and had most likely considered himself just as evil as they were.</p><p>Before he died, before she died, she would teach him otherwise. He wasn\u2019t evil. He was a protector. No wonder the thought of her death troubled him. In his eyes, he would have failed to protect her. The sweet, darling man.</p><p>\u201cPlease, go on,\u201d she beseeched.</p> <p>Gideon nodded. \u201cAll those deaths never affected him, making him see fatality around every corner. And then, when our hated enemy, Baden, was not decapitated, Aeron saw that immortals could live forever. That didn\u2019t freak him out.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so. The deaths he\u2019d brought about in the line of duty had given him a healthy appreciation for mortality, especially when his dear friend was decapitated. Now, he expected everyone around him to die, knowing there was nothing he could do to stop it\u2014nothing he could do to protect them, as she\u2019d just figured out.</p><p>To a man who valued strength and power, that helplessness had to bother him greatly. That must be why he kept himself so distanced from everyone but Legion. The fewer people he cared about, the fewer people he had to worry about saving.</p><p>So how had Legion snuck her way past his defenses?</p><p>More than that, how had Legion escaped his demon\u2019s need to reprimand? The little fiend had hardly lived a blameless life. Look what the creature had done to innocent Olivia.</p> <p>\u201cAs for Legion,\u201d Gideon said, seeming to read her thoughts. \u201cI think Aeron has never secretly craved a family of his own, and Legion doesn\u2019t give him that.\u201d</p><p>So. Aeron had secretly wanted a family\u2014just as she had\u2014and Legion provided that for him. Somewhat. I could become his family, as well, Olivia thought. Not that she wanted to be Legion\u2019s stepmother, but for the pleasure of staying with Aeron, she could endure even so heinous a title.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see the eagerness in your eyes, angel, and I\u2019m very glad for it. You should know that, even in the heavens, he preferred wild women, and I can sense that, at heart, you\u2019re as wild as can be\u2014no matter that you clearly haven\u2019t convinced yourself otherwise. Though Aeron thinks that\u2019s what he wants, I assure you, it\u2019s not what he needs.\u201d</p><p>Oh...no, she thought, suddenly dejected. Aeron preferred tame women, but Gideon thought he needed someone wild. Gideon also thought that, no matter what Olivia did or said, she wasn\u2019t wild at heart and would never be.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you warning me away? Only a few minutes ago, you told me how to seduce him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy girl Aeron doesn\u2019t deserve a little torment now and then.\u201d</p> <p>Oh. A little entertainment. That\u2019s what Gideon considered her.</p><p>He was wrong. Maybe she\u2019d been gentle before\u2014or had pretended to be\u2014but the more time she spent in this fortress, the more she was learning about herself.</p><p>Gentleness was what she\u2019d had her entire life. Lysander had been gentle with her. The other angels had been gentle with her. She\u2019d been gentle with them.</p><p>In Aeron\u2019s arms, she\u2019d come alive with sensation. She\u2019d wanted more, wanted harder and chaotic, control unattainable. She\u2019d wanted wild. A few times, he\u2019d tried to slow things down. He\u2019d tried to soften his touch, proving Gideon\u2019s claim that he preferred gentle. Or thought he did.</p><p>He did beg you to fondle his wings, she reminded herself, and that fondling had been anything but tender.</p><p>Still. He hadn\u2019t wanted her to pierce her navel. What would he think when she actually did it? When she got a tattoo, as she also planned to do? Maybe of a butterfly. Would he no longer even want to kiss her?</p><p>\u201cThis conversation has officially depressed me,\u201d she said. \u201cNot that I didn\u2019t enjoy talking with you. You gave me the details I begged for, and I\u2019m grateful, but I think I\u2019ll read to you now, if that\u2019s okay. I need a distraction before I head to the kitchen and try out every bottle in the liquor cabinet.\u201d That\u2019s what many humans did when they were given news they didn\u2019t like.</p><p>\u201cNot like we can do both,\u201d he said, and motioned to an array of bottles atop his dresser.</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Eager, Olivia pushed to her feet, crossed the room and swiped up as many of the fuller bottles as she could hold. The liquid swished inside, different scents drifting to her nose. Apples, pears, lemons. Dark spice. \u201cGiggle juice is what I\u2019ve always called it,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019ve always wanted to try it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow\u2019s not your chance. Don\u2019t you dare pour any down my throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be my pleasure.\u201d After tipping one bottle over Gideon\u2019s lips while he gulped back mouthful after mouthful, then draining the rest of the contents herself and nearly choking\u2014it didn\u2019t taste as wonderful as she\u2019d hoped\u2014she reclaimed her seat and flipped open the book, unmindful of the page.</p><p>The words blurred slightly.</p><p>\u201c\u2018She gripped her breasts and squeezed,\u2019\u201d she read. Interesting. \u201c\u2018Just as he had done earlier. Her nipples throbbed all the more, wanting his hands. A whimper escaped her. Normally she would have hated herself for making such a sound, but now, this moment, she was owned by her passion.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I know the feeling, Olivia thought. Sadly, she might not know it again.</p><p>She started on another bottle.</p><p>AERON PUSHED HIS WAY INSIDE the fortress, his hands drawn into tight fists. He didn\u2019t look around or head to the kitchen even though he was starved. He started pounding up the steps.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019re you going?\u201d Cameo asked, keeping pace beside him.\u201cTo find Olivia.\u201d To question her. He wouldn\u2019t kiss her as he\u2019d been craving these past few hours, thinking about her rather than searching for Nightmares. Worrying that he was becoming obsessed with her in the same way he\u2019d once been obsessed with killing Danika.</p><p>Only, he didn\u2019t want to kill Olivia.</p><p>He wanted to finally finish what they\u2019d started in his bed. Yes, they\u2019d both come, but he hadn\u2019t sunk inside her. He hadn\u2019t taken her all the way.</p><p>Still. He\u2019d already soiled her, he\u2019d decided, by spilling his seed on her belly. He\u2019d already earned Lysander\u2019s wrath. Not that he cared anymore. Not that the angel had come gunning for him yet. So what other harm could making love to her cause?</p><p>Just like that, his focus switched. Rather than question her when he found her, he\u2019d strip her. There you go again. Thinking about her rather than taking care of business.</p><p>Didn\u2019t help that his demon had yet to shut up. If he heard the word more one more time, he was going to erupt in a blood-craze all his own.</p><p>Concentrate. Question her. Yes. That\u2019s what he\u2019d do. No stripping her. Unless her clothes were too tight, then he would be doing her a favor, removing them and helping her breathe.</p><p>Concentrate, damn you. Question. Her. She\u2019d predicted that he would be unable to find Shadow Girl. Nightmares. Scarlet. Whatever. And she\u2019d been right. How had she known the girl would seemingly vanish without a trace?</p><p>Looked like he needed her, after all, he thought with a scowl. That didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d keep her, though. Definitely not. Strip her, however...</p><p>He punched the wall.</p><p>\u201cWow. You like her that much?\u201d Cameo said, incredulous. \u201cI mean, I know you\u2019re fooling around with her, but I\u2019ve never seen you this keyed up over a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you insist...I don\u2019t understand her and it\u2019s driving me insane.\u201d He rarely shared his problems with his friends. They had enough to deal with. But just then, he didn\u2019t know what else to do. He needed help. Before he lost himself completely.</p><p>At the landing, he stopped and Cameo did the same. He scrubbed a hand down his face. \u201cShe\u2019s making me feel things I\u2019ve never felt before and want things I\u2019ve never wanted before. Cronus has to be teaching me a lesson. That\u2019s the only explanation for her effect on me.\u201d No other woman had ever come close to tying him up like this. \u201cI never should have dared the god king to send me a female I would chase. Except I\u2019ve hardly had to chase her, so she can\u2019t be the one Cronus sent to me. Gods, this makes no sense. Something has to be wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>Cameo patted his shoulder, her expression understanding even through the misery etched there. She opened her mouth to respond, but an echoing feminine sob stopped her.</p><p>They shared a confused look before Aeron kicked back into motion. He recognized that rich, sexy timbre, even in its sadness, but the sound hadn\u2019t come from his room, or the one next to it.</p><p>Masculine laughter abounded next, and he scowled. Gideon. Laughing. That should thrill him, with as much pain as Gideon had recently endured. Thrilled was not what he felt, however.</p><p>Aeron rushed around the corner and into his friend\u2019s bedroom. There was Olivia, lying directly beside Gideon, her head buried in his shoulder as her body shook. Gideon, the insensitive prick, was still laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he demanded, rushing forward. And no, it wasn\u2019t jealousy pouring through his veins like fire. It was rage. Rage that Olivia was bothering his injured friend. Yes. Rage. At Olivia. He didn\u2019t want to stab Gideon in the heart with one of his daggers. \u201cSomeone better explain before I do something we\u2019ll all regret.\u201d</p><p>Mine, his demon growled.</p><p>Better than \u201cmore,\u201d he supposed.</p><p>\u201cAeron?\u201d Olivia met his gaze briefly before turning her watery eyes away from him. She even reached up and wound her arms around Gideon\u2019s neck, holding on for dear life. Her tears soaked his shirt, her body again shaking violently. \u201cOh, great. Now he\u2019s angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you hurt her...\u201d Aeron snarled. Okay, fine. He wanted to stab Gideon.</p><p>He\u2019d never purposely hurt one of his friends. Had he fought them? Yes. Bashing each other\u2019s heads into walls was merely a healthy way of blowing off steam. But Sabin had once stabbed him in the back\u2014literally\u2014not to blow off steam but in real anger, and he\u2019d vowed never to make his friends feel that kind of betrayal. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Now, though, he didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to help himself. And he wouldn\u2019t be able to blame his demon, either. There were no vile images flashing through his mind, no desire to punish a sinner. There was just more of that blinding rage.</p><p>You don\u2019t care about this woman. You\u2019re getting rid of her at the first opportunity, he reminded himself, even as he scooped her up. Her sobs intensified, and she tried to hold on to Gideon.</p><p>Aeron shook her loose. \u201cGideon! Answer me. What happened? What did you do to her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverything. She\u2019s just a very happy drunk.\u201d Gideon gave him an unapologetic grin.</p><p>Pure, sweet Olivia drunk? Worse, someone other than Aeron had corrupted her?</p><p>Rage, yes. The dark emotion spread. Surprise, as well. And a jealousy he could no longer deny.</p><p>\u201cOh, Aeron,\u201d Olivia said between gasping hiccups, finally deciding to seek comfort from him rather than his friend. \u201cIt\u2019s so terrible. I have no wings and you\u2019re determined to kick me into the streets, alone and desperate. Legion was so mean, and for a few minutes, I was angry. I\u2019ve never been angry before. Not really. I didn\u2019t like it. And I know so much and could help you more than you realize, but you don\u2019t want my help. Maybe Lysander was right. Maybe I need to go home.\u201d</p><p>He recalled how bloody she\u2019d been when he\u2019d found her, those wings freshly removed. He recalled how much pain she\u2019d been in when Legion had bitten her. Guilt replaced every other emotion inside him. He should\u2014Wait. Go home?</p> <p>\u201cYou can go back?\u201d he asked her, astonished.</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm.\u201d Sniff, sniff. \u201cIn fourteen...no, ten days. I\u2019m losing count. You told me I was sick for three, right? But if I do return, I\u2019ll be forced to kill you. That\u2019s the only way they\u2019ll welcome me back into their fold.\u201d</p><p>So if she returned home, she\u2019d still have to kill him. Or try to. He could live with that. Hopefully literally. She would be out of reach, away from his dark influence and hurtful urges, safe from harm.</p><p>\u201cI can take care of myself, Olivia,\u201d he said, and she burst into a fresh round of sobs.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t always have to, Aeron. Someone needs to protect you the way you always protect others.\u201d</p><p>This was how she would kill him, he mused. Through tears and kindness. Already there was a sharp pang in his chest. He\u2019d always been the protector, the one to keep others safe. That someone else wanted to care for him was nearly irresistible. \u201cGet some rest,\u201d he told the still-grinning Gideon before striding out of the room.</p> <p>That\u2019s when he heard Wrath moaning in his head, as upset as Olivia was. Mine. Hurt. Better.</p><p>I\u2019m doing my best. \u201cI may not be able to fix anything you listed, but if you finally tell me what the demons did to you, I can make that better. Remember how?\u201d</p><p>Olivia rubbed her forehead against his slightly stubbled jaw. \u201cWith a kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His grip tightened. Gods, he was a giver. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Sniff, sniff. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Gideon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>So. Even drunk, there was no chance she\u2019d spill. He could have pushed, but didn\u2019t. No more tears. Please, gods, no more tears.</p> <p>Inside his bedroom, he eased her onto the mattress. She peered up at him, her eyeballs practically spinning. \u201cDo you wanna have sex now?\u201d she asked, then hiccupped. \u201cI think I gave my panties to Gideon, so I\u2019m good to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave your panties to Gideon? And he accepted them?\u201d Incredulous, Aeron fought the urge to check under her skirt, then fought the even stronger urge to return to Gideon\u2019s room and finally attack.</p><p>\u201cI did, and he did. So are we going to do this or not?\u201d</p><p>Sadly, he was tempted. Even with her swollen eyes and splotchy skin, she looked enchanting\u2014and beddable. His body still craved her, and no one had ever needed comforting more. Not that he knew how to comfort anyone. But she deserved better than a drunken first time.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, Olivia. In the morning\u2014\u201d at which point she\u2014and he?\u2014only had nine days before he ensured she returned home \u201c\u2014we have a lot to discuss.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>LEGION BATTLED TEARS as she raced through the fires and screams of hell. Once her home, now her hated refuge. She was on all fours, galloping like a lowly animal, a position she knew well. It kept her close to the ground, beneath notice, and increased her speed. Plus, it was the only position allowed for someone like her. Were she to stand and walk, every High Lord within reach would feel compelled to punish her for such impudence.</p><p>And speaking of High Lords, they were all around her, torturing the human souls that had been sent here to forever rot. They were laughing, loving every bit of the blood and the pain and the vomit.Aeron didn\u2019t care that she was here, a place he knew she despised, either. Not anymore. How could he? He had protected the angel. Her enemy. He had then saved and, worse, comforted that angel.</p><p>Why? Why hadn\u2019t he tried to protect Legion? Why hadn\u2019t he saved and comforted her? The tears began to fall, and laced with poison as they were, they stung her scales.</p><p>When she reached a hidden alcove of shadow and stone, she stopped, stood and pressed her back against a jagged, blood-splattered wall. She was having trouble catching her breath, and her heart\u2014which was now broken in half, damn that Aeron\u2014pounded sharply.</p><p>The long length of her forked tongue emerged, and she wiped away a few of the tears. While the tart poison would have sent anyone else to their knees, sobbing and begging for mercy, it merely stung anew. So badly she\u2019d wanted the angel to die from that poison, but it hadn\u2019t happened. Aeron had been too determined to save her, and what Aeron wanted, Aeron found a way to get. Always.</p><p>What was she going to do? The first time she\u2019d seen Aeron, chained and hungry for blood, she\u2019d loved him. He\u2019d been fighting that hunger, had even hated himself for it, and never before had she encountered anyone who preferred to save rather than destroy. She\u2019d thought, He can save me.</p><p>In a mere heartbeat of time, she\u2019d decided to live with Aeron. To marry him. To sleep in his bed every night and wake up next to him every morning. Instead, he\u2019d had his friend Maddox build her a bed of her own. Still, she\u2019d wanted to be everything to him. Had known all she needed was time.</p><p>Yet time was not a luxury she had anymore. She couldn\u2019t return to their home because he\u2019d invited the angel to stay. That stupid, ugly angel, with her long curly hair and cloud-pale skin. Legion\u2014and every demon, really\u2014couldn\u2019t remain in the presence of such goodness for long. It hurt. Truly hurt. Somehow eroding everything they were, destroying them little by little.</p><p>Aeron didn\u2019t hurt, though, she thought darkly. How could he? He\u2019d welcomed the bitch. Maybe Wrath had lived among humans for too long to react to the angel as a normal demon should. Maybe Wrath was buried too deeply inside Aeron.</p><p>Either way, Aeron should have cared about Legion\u2019s pain. But he hadn\u2019t. Just like he no longer cared about her. He\u2019d sent her away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, sweet child?\u201d</p><p>Legion gasped at the sudden intrusion, peering wide-eyed at the newcomer. She hadn\u2019t heard him approach, yet he was now in front of her, as if he\u2019d simply materialized. Or had been waiting, invisible, all along.</p><p>A tremor rolled down her spine. She would have scrambled away, but the rock behind her stopped her. Bad, bad, bad. This was so bad. A visit she couldn\u2019t hope to survive.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone!\u201d she managed to work past the sudden lump in her throat. A lump that held a thousand whimpers.</p><p>\u201cDo you know me?\u201d he asked smoothly, completely unoffended. Or seemingly so.</p><p>Oh, yes. She knew him. Hence the whimpers. He was Lucifer, brother to Hades and the prince of most demons. He was evil. True, undiluted evil.</p><p>Sweet child, he\u2019d called her. Ha! He would stab her in the back the moment she turned away from him and laugh while doing so. Just for \u201cfunsies,\u201d as Anya would say. She swallowed.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d He snapped his fingers and in the next instant, they both stood in the center of his throne room. Rather than stone and mortar, the walls of Lucifer\u2019s palace were composed of crackling flames. \u201cIt\u2019s a simple question. Do. You. Know. Me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I do. Yesss.\u201d Legion had been here only twice before, but the first time, during her birth into this realm, had been enough to convince her that she never wanted to return. The second time, she was brought here for punishment. Punishment she\u2019d earned for refusing to torture a human soul.</p><p>\u201cConcentrate,\u201d Lucifer snapped.</p><p>She blinked and forced herself to focus. Plumes of black smoke wafted from the floor, the walls, even the throne atop the dais, curling around her like fingers of the damned. There were screams trapped inside those plumes, and those screams taunted her.</p><p>So ugly, they said.</p><p>So stupid.</p><p>So unnecessary.</p><p>Unwanted. Undesired.</p><p>\u201cI asked you another question, Legion. You will answer.\u201d</p><p>Though she wanted to look anywhere but at him, she forced her gaze to meet his. Lucifer was tall, with shiny black hair and orange-gold eyes. He was muscled, like Aeron, and handsome\u2014but not as handsome as Aeron\u2014despite the inferno always banked in his expression.</p><p>What had he asked? Oh, yeah. What was wrong with her? \u201cI\u2014\u201d What should she tell him? A lie, definitely, but something he would believe. \u201cI jussst wanted to play a game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA game, hmm?\u201d His lips curled slowly, wickedly as he strolled around her, closing in, studying, taking her measure and clearly finding her lacking. \u201cI have a better idea.\u201d</p><p>The heat of his breath somehow reached the back of her neck, and she shuddered. At least he didn\u2019t stab her as she\u2019d feared. \u201cYesss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall bargain, you and I.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach twisted into cutting knots. His bargains were notorious, for they always ended in his favor. That\u2019s how he\u2019d escaped hell for a year to live unfettered on Earth. He\u2019d bargained with the goddess of Oppression, the very one responsible for ensuring the walls surrounding this underground prison were solid, impenetrable. The one who had allowed many demon High Lords to escape. The one who had then died, her bones used to construct Pandora\u2019s box. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo?\u201d she said, and though she\u2019d meant it as a statement, it emerged as a question.</p><p>In front of her once again, he tsked. \u201cDon\u2019t be so hasty. You haven\u2019t even heard what I have to offer.\u201d</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t be good for her, that much she could guess. \u201cI\u2014I ssshould go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He spun on his heel and glided to his throne, where he eased down, relaxed, utterly sure of himself. Smoke reached him, surrounded him, and flames soon followed, dancing around as if happy just to be near him.</p><p>Legion tried to shift from one foot to the other\u2014only to realize her feet had been glued in place. There would be no leaving. Not until he was done with her. Still. She didn\u2019t panic. She\u2019d been beaten before and had survived. She\u2019d been called terrible names and laughed at; she\u2019d been thrown into seemingly never-ending pits and kicked into ice fields, unable to transport herself somewhere else.</p><p>\u201cI can help you get something you want,\u201d Lucifer said. \u201cSomething you\u2019ll do anything to possess.\u201d</p><p>Ha! There was nothing he could offer that would\u2014</p><p>\u201cI can help you win Aeron\u2019s heart.\u201d</p> <p>For a moment, she forgot to breathe. Only when her lungs and throat began burning, scalding, did she force her mouth to open and suck air inside. He could...what?</p><p>\u201cAs you like to spy on the happenings here for the Lords of the Underworld\u2014\u201d there at the end, bitterness had filled his tone \u201c\u2014I like to spy on the happenings of the surface. I know you\u2019re enamored of Aeron, keeper of my darling Wrath.\u201d</p><p>Hearing his derision, she raised her chin. \u201cHe lovesss me, too. He told me ssso.\u201d</p><p>Lucifer arched a brow. \u201cAre you sure about that? He was so angry that you\u2019d hurt his precious little angel.\u201d</p><p>The word precious used to describe that pig of an angel caused red spots to wink over her vision. She was Aeron\u2019s precious. Her. No one else.</p><p>Lucifer waved his hand regally, and the air in front of Legion thickened, wavered, dust motes sparkling. Colors burst to life. Then Aeron was there, bending down and gently lifting the angel\u2019s wrist to his mouth. He sucked at the poison Legion had injected in her, and her lithe body stilled.</p> <p>Seeing his mouth on that disgusting interloper caused the red to brighten and rage to flood her. Rage and hate and determination.</p><p>\u201cHow will you help me?\u201d she found herself asking. The scene disappeared and she was once more looking at Lucifer. Perhaps bargaining with him wouldn\u2019t be so bad. Perhaps she would be the one to come out ahead. She was smart. Resourceful. Right?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d he said, gaze raking over her scaled body. \u201cYou\u2019re as ugly as a creature can be.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped as wave after wave of hurt hit her, and she tried to backpedal, wanting to hide. She wasn\u2019t ugly. Was she? She was different from Aeron, yes. She was different from the angel, as well. But that didn\u2019t mean she was ugly.</p><p>\u201cI can practically hear the thoughts in your head. Allow me to address them. Yes, you are indeed ugly. Actually, saying you\u2019re ugly is being kind. I can hardly stand to look at you. In fact, to settle my stomach I\u2019m going to have to stare just over your shoulder while we finish this conversation.\u201d</p><p>She was ugly, then. Hideous. A monster. The devil himself couldn\u2019t even bear to look at her. Tears filled her eyes. \u201cHow will you help me, then?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>He gazed down at his yellowed, curling nails, as if he hadn\u2019t a care. \u201cI, powerful being that I am, can make you pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she insisted.</p> <p>\u201cTo start, I\u2019d give you silky, flowing hair. Any color you desired and far better than the angel\u2019s. I\u2019d give you smooth, creamy skin. Again, any color you desired. I\u2019d give you bedroom eyes no man can resist. A tall, slender body with big breasts. Men go crazy for those, you know. And while a forked tongue has its uses in bed, I\u2019d probably get rid of that. Your lisp is annoying.\u201d</p><p>He could make her pretty? Pretty enough to win Aeron? Hope bloomed in her chest; the mere thought of finally being with the man of her dreams\u2014living as husband and wife\u2014had her shedding one reservation after another. \u201cWhat do you desire in return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. That,\u201d he said, shrugging as if it were of no importance. \u201cAll I\u2019d want is to possess your new body.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t underssstand. How could I win Aeron if I\u2019m not...me? How could I win Aeron if you are me?\u201d</p><p>He pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cI see you\u2019re stupid, too, which means we\u2019ll have to fix that, as well. I didn\u2019t mean I\u2019d possess your new body right away, my single-minded friend. I would be allowed to do so only if you failed to win him.\u201d</p><p>Her frown intensified. Being beautiful didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d automatically win?</p><p>The silence earned her a shake of his head. \u201cClearly breaking my meaning down as if I were talking to a child didn\u2019t work. What else can I do?\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks heated, and it had nothing to do with the fire around them. She wasn\u2019t stupid or a child, damn him! \u201cYou\u2019re trying to confussse me on purpossse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t want you crying foul later. So listen closely. I will give you nine days to seduce Aeron. I would say all you have to do is gain his declaration of love, but you already have that. What you don\u2019t have is his sexual attraction, and that\u2019s what you really want. So get him in your bed, of his own free will, and you win our bargain. You may keep your new body and live happily ever after. Without my interference.\u201d</p><p>Everything sounded fair and wonderful and perfect. Everything but the timing. \u201cWhy only nine days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the reason matter? It won\u2019t change anything about the bargain.\u201d</p><p>Resistance. Of course the reason mattered. \u201cTell me,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cFine. Nine is my favorite number.\u201d</p><p>A lie, definitely. She could push, but... Was learning the truth more important than gaining a chance at that which she desired most?</p><p>No.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I fail?\u201d she asked. He\u2019d told her what he wanted, yes, but she needed every detail.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d His fingertips traced circles on the arms of his throne. \u201cIf you fail to seduce him into your bed, for fucking, not sleeping, within the allotted time, you must allow me to possess your new body, as I said. For however long I wish.\u201d</p><p>There it was. The final detail. He would be able to control her for \u201chowever long\u201d he wished. In other words, forever.</p><p>But why would he want\u2014 The answer slammed into her and she gasped. Lucifer viewed her as his ticket to escaping hell. Because Legion wasn\u2019t bound to hell, but to Aeron, she was allowed to leave this place. Lucifer was not. He was trapped here.</p><p>If she gave him permission to overtake her, he would then be free to leave. What he wanted, they would do. She would be aware, yes, but her wants would cease to matter.</p><p>If it were as simple as taking control of her body and using it to escape, Lucifer wouldn\u2019t waste time bargaining with her. But demons couldn\u2019t possess bodies, human or otherwise, without permission. Even the demons in Pandora\u2019s box had needed the gods\u2019 blessing to possess the Lords.</p><p>\u201cIt all comes down to whether or not you think you can succeed,\u201d Lucifer said. \u201cDo you? I certainly do, which makes me feel silly for even offering this bargain. Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d In one fluid movement, he pushed to his feet. \u201cI mean, there are other, weaker demons I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d she rushed out. \u201cJussst hold on.\u201d</p><p>Slowly he eased back down.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t let this chance slip away. The angel, who was incapable of speaking a lie, had told her that Aeron saw her as a child. That Aeron considered himself a father figure to her. That would never change\u2014unless she did something drastic.</p><p>\u201cTermsss must be ssspelled out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t they already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot from my end.\u201d</p><p>He clutched a hand over his chest. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. A bargain was binding, even for creatures such as them. Once they both agreed, she would be trapped, the bargain a living entity inside her. There could be no changing her mind. If she failed, she would concede what she\u2019d promised, unable to stop herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wounded. But very well,\u201d he said. \u201cState exactly what you expect from me.\u201d</p><p>If she didn\u2019t, she would receive no more than that, but most assuredly less. \u201cI have to be prettier than the angel, with pale hair, golden skin, brown eyes and big breasts.\u201d All the opposite of the little bitch. \u201cI want the entire nine days, with no time warpsss.\u201d As she spoke, her excitement grew. She was really going to do this. She was really going to try and win Aeron\u2019s heart. \u201cAnd I want to be awake when I\u2019m with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Lucifer said, an amused twinkle in those fiery eyes. \u201cYou caught me on that one. I planned to put you into a coma until your time was up.\u201d</p><p>And she had stopped him from doing so. She was feeling very proud of herself at the moment. See? She wasn\u2019t stupid, after all. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill him, either. If he diesss before time runsss out, the bargain diesss, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. Now, are those your only demands?\u201d he asked, ever the indulgent lord.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to ssspeak with a lisssp, asss you sssaid. I want to firssst appear before Aeron, not halfway acrossss the world, jussst asss I am, and then I want to change bodiesss in front of him.\u201d That way, he wouldn\u2019t think she was Bait or a Hunter and try to get rid of her before she could seduce him.</p><p>\u201cVery doable. Is that all?\u201d</p><p>She gulped, considered, then nodded.</p><p>Once more, he stood. He splayed his arms, fire leaping from his fingertips. \u201cThen it\u2019s agreed. You shall have everything you named. But if you fail to lure Aeron, Lord of the Underworld and keeper of the demon of Wrath, to your bed and inside your body within those nine days, you will return to this throne room, where you will willingly consent to my possession of your body.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Another nod.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d he demanded, no longer the kind and benevolent man he\u2019d pretended to be.</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p> <p>The moment the words left her mouth, a sharp pain tore through her. Grunting, she doubled over. She couldn\u2019t breathe, was fading, every muscle she possessed spasming. But just as quickly as the pain had sprouted, the bargain birthing to life inside her, it left her and she straightened.</p><p>\u201cAnd so it is done,\u201d Lucifer said. Then he gave her the same smile he\u2019d bestowed on her when he\u2019d first brought her here. Wicked, satisfied. \u201cDid I forget to mention that, when you fail, my first order of business will be to murder each of the Lords of the Underworld and set their demons free?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>AS THE NIGHT GAVE WAY to dawn, the citizens just now awakening and emerging to begin their days, Aeron stalked the streets, Paris at his side, both remaining in the shadows, silent. Perhaps Paris, who hadn\u2019t hesitated in his choice of companion this time\u2014did that mean he was finally getting over Sienna?\u2014was as lost in thought as Aeron was as they headed back to the fortress.</p><p>Olivia had cried herself to sleep, and he\u2019d held her through those tears. When she\u2019d finally fallen into unconsciousness, he\u2019d flown her to Gilly\u2019s apartment, thinking that things would be easier that way. If she couldn\u2019t talk to him, she couldn\u2019t tempt him to forget his purpose. But he hadn\u2019t left right away. Paris had needed time with his chosen, so Aeron had snuggled in next to the angel.Once again, he\u2019d found that he liked holding her. Which was all the more reason to finally get rid of her. But as he\u2019d walked away from her, meaning to do so permanently, he\u2019d no longer been sure he wanted to get rid of her. Not that he\u2019d ever been sure, but damn, his resolve had been shaken.</p> <p>Seeing her in Gideon\u2019s arms had given life to a possessive streak he hadn\u2019t known he possessed, the earlier incidents with William and Paris paltry in comparison. The thought of Olivia roaming these roads, determined to have \u201cfun,\u201d alone, so easy for the plucking... His teeth ground together, a common occurrence whenever he thought of her.</p><p>A man passed, claiming his attention. A human. Mid-twenties. Large. Instantly Wrath began growling, chomping for freedom, conveying images of meaty hands swinging at\u2014and connecting with\u2014a sobbing female face.</p><p>Wifebeater, Aeron realized as Wrath flashed more of those images through his mind.</p><p>You\u2019re worthless, the man liked to yell, spittle spraying from his mouth. I\u2019m not sure why I married you. You were a fat cow then and you\u2019re a fatter cow now.</p><p>For once, Aeron didn\u2019t try to stop himself. What if Olivia had been the target of that rage? What if Legion had been? Allowing Wrath to pull his strings without any resistance, loving his demon more than he should, without the taint of guilt, he turned on his heel, raced forward and closed the distance between himself and the man. A man who gasped when Aeron grabbed him and spun him around.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAeron,\u201d Paris called, weary.</p><p>Aeron ignored him. \u201cYou disgust me, you insignificant little shit. Why don\u2019t you try beating me?\u201d</p><p>The man paled, trembled. \u201cI don\u2019t know who you are or what you think you\u2019re doing, but you better get out of my face, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Tourist, he thought, or he would have been recognized. \u201cOr what?\u201d Aeron smiled slowly, cruelly. \u201cYou\u2019ll call me another bad name?\u201d</p><p>There was a snarl low in the man\u2019s throat. He had a knife in his pocket, Aeron suddenly knew. He wanted to stab Aeron in the stomach, in the neck, and watch him bleed to death.</p><p>Without any warning, Aeron struck. His right fist connected with the man\u2019s nose. There was a grunt, a howl of pain. Blood sprayed. He didn\u2019t pause, but swung his other hand. His left fist connected with the man\u2019s mouth, splitting tissue. The howl became a scream.</p><p>Aeron wasn\u2019t done.</p><p>Can\u2019t fight fair. Have to hurt. Wrath was in total control.</p> <p>Still, Aeron didn\u2019t mind.</p><p>As the man tried to orient himself, tried to struggle free, Aeron kneed him in the groin. His opponent doubled over, air shooting out of his crimson-soaked lips. No mercy. This bastard had never shown any. Aeron kicked him in the shoulder, and he flew backward. After that, he was in too much pain to stand or even defend himself.</p><p>He gazed up at Aeron through tear-filled eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t hurt me. Please, don\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times has your wife said something similar to you?\u201d Aeron dropped to his knees, straddling the man\u2019s waist.</p><p>Drawing on a reservoir of strength he probably hadn\u2019t known he possessed, the white-faced man tried to scoot backward. Aeron merely tightened the grip of his legs, holding the bastard in place.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d The man\u2019s voice was shaky, desperate.</p><p>Aeron struck again and again, raining one blow after another. The man\u2019s head whipped left and right with each new impact. More blood sprayed. Teeth even flew out like pieces of candy. Skin split and bones broke.</p><p>Soon, there were no grunts, no gasps.</p><p>A hand patted his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve punished him. You can stop now,\u201d Paris said from behind him.</p><p>Aeron stilled. He was panting, his knuckles throbbing. Too easy. That had been too easy. The man hadn\u2019t paid enough for the damage he\u2019d inflicted. But maybe he learned a lesson, a voice of reason said inside Aeron\u2019s head. For reason to have returned, control must be his once again.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d Paris suggested.</p><p>Home, no. He wasn\u2019t ready to return to his room\u2014to see the bed where he\u2019d kissed and touched Olivia. Still, Aeron stood. He gave the man a final kick in the stomach before facing his friend. \u201cI need some time. Alone.\u201d</p><p>A while passed in silence, Paris studying his hard expression. Finally he nodded. \u201cAll right. Maybe use it to decompress, \u2019cause damn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlan to.\u201d Even after Paris walked away, Aeron remained in place, trying to pull himself back together. I\u2019m in control, he reminded himself, even though he still didn\u2019t want to be. I\u2019m in control.</p><p>Wrath continued to prowl through his mind, worked into a frenzy and ready for the next victim.</p><p>He needed Legion.</p><p>Or Olivia, he thought then.</p><p>His heart began pounding for a different reason, and it took him a minute to realize why. Arousal mixed with regret was beating through him exactly as his fists had beat at the human. Olivia hadn\u2019t woken when he\u2019d left her in Gilly\u2019s guest room. She hadn\u2019t woken when he\u2019d given Gilly instructions to call him the moment she did. No, she\u2019d lain on the bed, splayed adorably, hair tangled around her, snoring delicately. Fighting the urge to curl beside her again had proved nearly impossible. But he\u2019d done it. He\u2019d headed out to round up Paris.</p><p>Perhaps he should return to her, he thought, heading in the direction of Gilly\u2019s apartment before he could stop himself. He glanced up at the heavens, hoping for guidance. His gaze never made it to the stars. Instead, he caught sight of white, feathered wings and ground to a halt.</p><p>Galen. Leader of the Hunters. False angel. Bastard.</p><p>Automatically Aeron palmed two blades and slipped deeper in the shadows. He shouldn\u2019t have come into town without a gun, but he\u2019d been so preoccupied with Olivia that he hadn\u2019t thought to grab anything extra. Galen was perched on top of a building, those wings outstretched as he scanned the streets.</p><p>If he knew Aeron was below, watching him, he gave no notice.</p><p>All the while Wrath howled inside Aeron\u2019s head. The warrior had committed too many sins for the demon to process, the need to kill simply flooding Aeron. Control. Absolute control. He couldn\u2019t lose it this time.</p><p>Galen straightened unexpectedly. Aeron pressed against the wall of the building behind him, sure he\u2019d been spotted but unwilling to walk away. Perhaps tonight they would end this. Finally.</p><p>Galen jumped, falling...falling... His wings stretched farther, flapped once, and he landed softly, several yards away from Aeron.</p><p>Aeron tensed. He couldn\u2019t kill Galen without severe consequences, but he could torture the bastard before locking him away. And then torture him again afterward.</p><p>A moment ticked by, then another, Galen simply tucking his wings into his back and waiting. He never approached.</p><p>Every fiber of Aeron\u2019s being wanted to leap forward and attack. Surprise attacks were his forte, after all, but he held himself steady. Sometimes battle wasn\u2019t the best course of action in a war. Sometimes merely watching and learning reaped far greater rewards. What was going on here? What was Galen doing in Budapest?</p><p>He\u2019d come here before, of course, but he\u2019d recently left to fight a contingent of Lords who had raided a facility in Chicago where he\u2019d been raising\u2014and educating\u2014halfling children. Half human, half immortal. All of whom had been taught to hate the Lords.</p><p>Now that school was in ruins, the Lords having liberated the kids and found them loving homes. Homes the Hunters would hopefully never be able to track down.</p><p>Was Galen here for vengeance, then?</p><p>Punish, Wrath said.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d Galen said, his rich voice filling the silence.</p><p>Aeron scanned the area, but saw no one approaching. So, to whom was Galen speaking? To himself? Or\u2014</p><p>A pair of legs appeared a few feet in front of Galen. Only, those legs weren\u2019t attached to a torso. What the hell? The question had barely formed before a waist appeared, then shoulders, arms\u2014and there, on the inside of the...apparition\u2019s right wrist, was a symbol of Infinity, the mark of a true, dedicated Hunter\u2014and lastly, a face. Then a male was standing there, fully formed, holding a piece of dark, flowing cloth.</p><p>Not a ghost, then, for there was no shimmering outline around him. Just a man, as real as Aeron was. But how had he\u2014 Cloth. The word echoed through Aeron\u2019s mind, followed by another. Invisible.</p><p>His eyes widened in dread and astonishment. Cloth. Cloak. The...Cloak of Invisibility?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that.\u201d Galen confiscated the cloak and folded it once, twice. Rather than cause the material to shrink yet thicken, each fold diminished both size and width, and soon it appeared the warrior held a simple square of paper. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, yes. This could be nothing else but the Cloak of Invisibility.</p><p>Galen tucked the artifact into his robe, even as Aeron reached out automatically. Stay. Wait. His arm fell to his side. Information first, artifact second.</p><p>\u201cThere are cameras here,\u201d the human said. \u201cI haven\u2019t found them, but I know the demons keep the city under surveillance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d Galen laughed, smug. \u201cThey\u2019ve been taken care of.\u201d</p><p>Oh, really. How? The cameras hadn\u2019t been disabled. Torin would have texted him. Had someone hacked into the system perhaps, and was even now replaying feed? That had happened in one of the movies Paris had forced him to watch. Or could more powerful forces be at work?</p><p>Cronus sometimes helped the Lords, so it stood to reason that another god could be helping the Hunters.</p><p>\u201cYou confirmed that they have an angel in their midst?\u201d Galen asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, though she doesn\u2019t seem to be as powerful as you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFew angels are. And half their troops are missing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Another laugh from Galen. \u201cVery good. Now join the others and stay hidden until I return. Some of our troops disappeared yesterday, and even our lovely queen has lost sight of them. Once I find them, we can attack. And this time, we\u2019ll show no mercy.\u201d</p><p>Punish! Wrath chimed in again.</p><p>\u201cNo mercy? But I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>Galen shook his head. \u201cTell the others our experiment was a success.\u201d</p> <p>The man\u2019s grin was slow but no less satisfied. \u201cNo mercy, then.\u201d</p><p>Those white wings shot out, flapped, then stilled. Galen frowned. \u201cMy daughter. I want her left alone and alive.\u201d With that, he leapt into the air.</p><p>His surprising concern for Gwen would not save him, Aeron mused darkly, darting into the air himself. His wings were completely healed and he would have no problem following\u2014</p><p>Galen disappeared, there one moment, gone the next.</p><p>PUNISH!</p><p>Damn it, Aeron inwardly fumed. I can\u2019t. The Cloak was gone, out of his reach, and Galen with it. Only thing left to do was dig up more information. Not that getting it would redeem him from this failure.</p><p>His gaze narrowed on the human below him. The male wound around buildings and parked cars, always scanning his surroundings. Aeron followed. Finally his prey entered the newly remodeled Club Destiny\u2014now under new management and renamed The Asylum\u2014and didn\u2019t emerge.</p><p>Was that where the Hunters had set up camp?</p> <p>Impossible. Some of the Lords were fond of partying there, so Torin had installed security cameras inside. They would have picked up their enemy\u2019s presence. But...</p><p>Maybe not impossible. Perhaps the camera feed was being distorted, as it had been in the streets?</p><p>Other questions began playing through his mind. What experiment had been a success? Where had Galen\u2019s troops gone? Who was their \u201cqueen\u201d?</p><p>With Wrath still screaming in his head, demanding he act, he withdrew his cell phone and texted Torin. Call a meeting. Two hours. He had a few things to take care of first. Namely, Olivia. If she had answers, he would get them out of her. Meanwhile, she could calm him as he\u2019d originally planned. I found something. Even saw Galen with the godsdamn Cloak of Invisibility.</p><p>Torin, who never seemed to sleep, replied instantly. Make it one. If what you know is more important than our enemy having an artifact, I gotta hear it ASAP.</p><p>Done. Aeron pocketed the phone and pivoted on his heel to head back to Gilly\u2019s apartment, wake Olivia if he had to and demand those answers. But halfway there, a tall, menacing figure stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>Cronus, king of the gods, was frowning. As always, he wore a long, white robe and his feet were wrapped in sandals. His toes were visible, his toenails yellowed and curled.</p><p>Still, Aeron couldn\u2019t help but notice he looked younger than he ever had before. His hair no longer sported strands of gray, but was thick and sandy-colored. His face was almost unlined, his eyes a brighter brown than Aeron was accustomed to. What had caused the change?</p><p>\u201cMy Lord,\u201d he said, careful to keep his irritation to himself. The god rarely appeared when summoned, but never minded visiting at the most inopportune moments.</p><p>Wrath, still primed and ready, didn\u2019t flash images inside Aeron\u2019s mind, but then, it never did with this god. As had occurred when he spotted Galen, with too many sins to process, he merely experienced an overwhelming rush. Not to kill this time, but, curiously, to steal everything the god possessed. An urge he didn\u2019t understand, and hadn\u2019t been able to decipher.</p><p>\u201cYou have disappointed me, demon.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t I always? \u201cThis isn\u2019t the place for such a discussion. Hunters\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one can see or hear us. I\u2019ve made sure of it.\u201d</p><p>Just like another god had made sure the Hunters were unobservable? he wondered again. \u201cThen please. Tell me why I have disappointed you. I cannot live another moment without knowing.\u201d</p><p>Those brown eyes narrowed. \u201cYour sarcasm displeases me.\u201d</p><p>And as he knew all too well, bad things happened when the god king was displeased. Like Aeron\u2019s mind and demon becoming crazed with bloodlust and his friends\u2019 lives placed in jeopardy. \u201cMy apologies.\u201d He bowed his head to hide the hate surely shimmering from behind his lashes.</p><p>\u201cNeed I remind you that Galen\u2019s death is as important to you as it is to me? Yet you have allowed the angel to distract you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you wanted?\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><p>Cronus waved a hand through the air. \u201cThink you I paid any heed to your ridiculous begging? I do not want you distracted, so why would I send a woman to ensure that you are?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d wondered the same thing.</p><p>\u201cGet rid of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d he said, hands fisting.</p><p>Keep, Wrath snapped.</p><p>\u201cTry harder,\u201d Cronus ordered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll only be here another ten\u2014no, nine days.\u201d With morning approaching, he\u2019d lost a little more time with her. Which was a good thing. Yes, good. \u201cAnd then she\u2019ll be back in the heavens.\u201d Where she belonged. He would make sure of it.</p><p>A pang of sadness hit him, but he ignored it. Just as he ignored Wrath\u2019s whimper.</p><p>Cronus looked only marginally appeased at the words. \u201cIf she isn\u2019t, I will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will what?\u201d Another male suddenly appeared without warning. This one was tall and muscled, with pale hair and dark eyes. Like Galen, he had wings. Only, his were solid gold.</p><p>Lysander.</p><p>Aeron had only seen the warrior angel a few times, and as with Olivia, there were no flashes of vile deeds inside his head, no urge to punish in any way. That didn\u2019t mean Aeron liked the bastard, though.</p><p>She\u2019s too good for you, Lysander had said. Do not soil her or I\u2019ll bury you and all those you love.</p><p>Aeron hadn\u2019t sensed the angel on any level, then or now, and loathed how helpless that suddenly made him feel. Lysander could have sliced his throat and he wouldn\u2019t have been able to fight back.</p><p>Olivia had been right.</p><p>Cronus paled to an unflattering shade of white. \u201cLysander.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurt her,\u201d Lysander said, gaze darting between them, \u201ctouch a single hair on her head, and I will ruin you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you threaten me!\u201d Cronus bared his teeth in a scowl, color swiftly returning with his fury. \u201cI, who am almighty. I, who am\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA god, yes, but you can be killed.\u201d Lysander laughed without humor. \u201cYou know I never make idle threats. You hear the truth in my voice. Harm her, and your ruin will be ensured by my hand.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Thick, heavy.</p><p>\u201cI will do as I wish,\u201d Cronus finally said, \u201cand you will not stop me.\u201d Contrary to his words, however, he disappeared.</p><p>Aeron struggled to gain his bearings. The god king had never backed down from anything. That he had now, before an angel...that didn\u2019t bode well for Aeron, who was far less powerful.</p><p>\u201cAs for you.\u201d Lysander held out his hand and a sword composed solely of fire suddenly appeared. The tip of that sword was pointed at Aeron\u2019s throat before he could blink.</p><p>His flesh sizzled, even as his eyes narrowed. \u201cIs this about the...soiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how much I long to kill you,\u201d the angel said. \u201cColdly, without mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will not.\u201d Otherwise, the angel would have already struck. They were clearly the same in that regard. When it was warranted, warriors acted without hesitation. They didn\u2019t pause for conversation.</p><p>\u201cNo, I will not. Bianka wouldn\u2019t like it. Nor would Olivia.\u201d The sword lowered, vanished. \u201cI want her back, but she...likes you.\u201d Disgust layered his truthful voice. \u201cTherefore, you will live. For now. But I want you to make her miserable, to make her hate this mortal life, and I want you to do it while keeping her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo easily?\u201d Those dark eyes widened. \u201cYou do not want to keep her?\u201d</p><p>Want\u2014yes. In that instant, at the thought of losing her once and for all, he admitted that part of him did indeed want to keep her. At least for a little while. He wanted to help her have fun, wanted to watch her smile and hear her laugh. He wanted to hold her again. Kiss her again. Touch her again. Finally sink inside that sweet little body. But he wouldn\u2019t. She would be better off in the heavens, and he could return to the life he\u2019d made for himself. A life without complications. Or worry. Well, except for the coming attempts to end his life.</p><p>If she remained on earth, she would be human. Fragile. She would soon wither and die. And he would only be able to watch her. That wasn\u2019t something he would ever allow himself to do. Not for anyone. Not even her. Especially not her.</p><p>Mine, Wrath growled.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he forced himself to say\u2014to Wrath, to Lysander. No more ignoring or accepting the demon\u2019s claim. It was far too hazardous. \u201cI don\u2019t want to keep her.\u201d Unlike the angel, he could lie unflinchingly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYet you do wish to.... soil her completely?\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips into a mulish line. They were not having that conversation. Already his body reacted at the thought of bedding her, hardening in all the right places.</p><p>\u201cI can see that you do. Very well, then.\u201d Or maybe they were. \u201cBe with her in...that way, if that\u2019s what you both desire. I will not punish you for it, for no one knows better than I that a woman bent on seduction is irresistible. And no one knows Olivia better than I. If she doesn\u2019t experience everything\u2014\u201d Lysander, the fearsome angel actually blushed \u201c\u2014she won\u2019t leave you. So. After the act, make her miserable like I told you. Convince her to leave you without physically harming her, and I\u2019ll do my best to convince the Heavenly High Council to spare you and your demon friend.\u201d</p> <p>Lysander\u2019s best would equal success. No question in Aeron\u2019s mind.</p><p>Which meant Aeron and Legion would be alive, and Olivia would be forever protected. Olivia, whom Lysander knew better than anyone. That statement roused more emotion than any other\u2014even the one about being spared.</p><p>He should be the one to know her best.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he forced himself to say. Funny. The words sounded like they\u2019d been shoved past blades.</p><p>Lysander backed away, one step, two. \u201cI\u2019ll go now, but not without first imparting information you have long craved, as you cannot protect my ward the way she needs if you do not know what\u2019s happening around you.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for Aeron\u2019s response. But then, Aeron didn\u2019t have one. Had he spoken, he might have accidentally sent Lysander on his way rather than urging him to continue. \u201cYou\u2019ve often wondered why Cronus refuses to harm Galen on his own. The reason is simple. Cronus and his wife, Rhea, despise each other. They have taken opposite sides in your war and have vowed not to capture or kill any Lord themselves. Their way of keeping the fight somewhat fair, I suppose. Rhea is, of course, Galen\u2019s shield and informant.\u201d</p> <p>So. A god was helping the Hunters. And not just any god, but the Titan queen.</p><p>Should have known, should have guessed. Aeron had met her once, when the Titans had first defeated the Greeks and overtaken the heavens. They\u2019d summoned him, hoping he would supply information about the Lords. Rhea had looked as old as Cronus once had, with silver hair and wrinkled skin. She had radiated such coldness and hatred, Aeron had been taken aback\u2014though at the time, he\u2019d been more concerned by the news about the changing of the heavenly guard than by one lone goddess\u2019s chilly stare.</p><p>\u201cOne more bit of information I\u2019ll leave you with,\u201d Lysander said, \u201cfor this will aid you more than any other. Cronus and Rhea are like you.\u201d</p><p>Like him? \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are gods, yes, but they are also Lords. She is possessed by the demon of Strife and he\u2014he is possessed by Greed.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p> <p>OLIVIA GROANED. Her temples throbbed and her brain felt as if it had been doused in gasoline and set on fire. Still, she blinked open her eyes, determined to find out what was wrong with her; tears instantly formed, burning hotter than her head. And now, as awareness swept through her, she realized her mouth felt as if it had been stuffed with barbed wire and cotton.</p><p>She smacked her lips, confused, concerned.\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl,\u201d Aeron said. Though the words themselves were positive, he sounded harried. Even upset. And loud. Way too loud. \u201cWake up. Come on, Olivia. You can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d Through a foggy haze, she managed to focus on him. He crouched beside her, both hands extended. In one, two little pills rested. In the other was a cup of something dark and steamy. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to take these and drink this.\u201d At least he whispered this time.</p><p>As an angel, her senses hadn\u2019t been attuned to this plane and she\u2019d never truly smelled what humans cooked or drank or misted all over their bodies. But she could smell now, and that dark liquid was divine. Like bottled power, promising a fresh start, perhaps even a total body healing.</p><p>Coffee, she knew humans called it. No wonder they stood in mile-long lines and were willing to hand over every cent in their pockets for a single shot of it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are those?\u201d she managed to croak out, motioning to the pills with a tilt of her chin. Mistake! The movement sent a wave of dizziness crashing through her.</p><p>\u201cJust take them. They\u2019ll make you feel better.\u201d</p> <p>That, he hadn\u2019t whispered and she covered her ears. \u201cDo you have an inside voice? Could you use it, please?\u201d</p><p>He fisted the pills and gently dislodged her hands. \u201cStop playing. We don\u2019t have a lot of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh! Livvie\u2019s talking, and she\u2019s not averse to crushing your vocal cords if you don\u2019t keep it down.\u201d Why did she like this man again?</p><p>\u201cUp. Now.\u201d</p><p>Gingerly she sat up and rubbed the sleep from her eyes. Her still-burning brain nearly exploded, and she groaned.</p><p>Aeron gave her an impatient scowl. No, not impatient. The emotion in that scowl was dark, yes, but whatever he felt was harder. Needier? Had her groan affected him?</p><p>She wanted to preen. She did fluff her hair\u2014only to realize the curling mass tumbled down her shoulders in countless tangles. Her cheeks flamed as she pulled up the hood of her robe. Or tried to. Frowning, she looked down. Blue tank top, short black skirt.</p><p>Why was\u2014 Her slut-it-up makeover, she recalled. Oh, yeah. But that didn\u2019t explain her headache. Her lashes lifted and she met Aeron\u2019s penetrating stare. \u201cWas I injured?\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cHardly. You drank too much, and are now paying the price.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t the only price she was paying. One terrible memory after another suddenly flooded her. After that first bottle of giggle juice, which clearly hadn\u2019t been so giggly for her, she\u2019d experienced a terrible sense of loss. After the second bottle, a crushing sense of depression had come over her, and she had sobbed uncontrollably. Gideon had held her, and she\u2019d cried all over him. About Aeron. Mortifying.</p><p>Aeron lifted his hand to her mouth. \u201cTake the pills, but don\u2019t chew them. Understand? Swallow them whole.\u201d</p><p>Could she? Just then, they looked as big as oranges. Her arm was shaking as she pinched the pills between her fingers and tossed them into her mouth. Tried to swallow. Failed. Ugh. The taste! Her face scrunched in revulsion.</p><p>\u201cDrink. That\u2019ll help.\u201d He held the steaming cup to her lips and poured.</p><p>Olivia gagged. While the liquid smelled wonderful, it tasted like a mix of battery acid and dirt. How ladylike would she appear if she spit everything onto the bed?</p><p>\u201cSwallow,\u201d he barked as he set the cup aside.</p><p>She did. Barely. The pills slid down her throat, rubbing her raw, as did that disgusting coffee. When she stopped shuddering, she glared up at him. \u201cDon\u2019t ever do that to me again!\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes and settled back on his haunches. \u201cYou did it to yourself when you allowed Gideon to get you drunk.\u201d</p><p>How many times was he going to remind her of her folly?</p><p>\u201cNow, I need you to get up. Livvie. We\u2019ve got something to do.\u201d</p><p>Right now she only wanted to go back to bed. In fact, she fell back onto the mattress and gazed up at the ceiling. There was a poster of a woman in a bikini, her skin golden, her cheeks red and her nipples hard. Long blond hair blew in the wind. Olivia frowned, confusion returning. That hadn\u2019t been in Aeron\u2019s bedroom before.</p><p>She scanned the rest of the room, but didn\u2019t recognize anything. There was a walnut dresser with a crystal vase that glistened in the light seeping through white curtains, portraits of different-colored flowers on the walls and pretty beige carpet on the floor.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like your place,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her frown intensified. \u201cSo...whose is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours. You\u2019ll be staying here with Gilly, in this guest room. Do you know Gilly?\u201d He didn\u2019t give her a chance to answer. \u201cBoth Paris and William have bunked here before, hence the poster. Anyway, you\u2019ll be staying until you decide to return to the heavens.\u201d</p><p>Realization hit. He was so desperate to be done with her, he\u2019d flown her into town while she slept. Oh, that hurt.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d</p><p>Fight past your pain. \u201cYes, I do know Gilly,\u201d she said, voice trembling. She knew the girl better than any of the Lords, actually. Gilly was young and sweet and had lived a tragic life until moving here, her parents having hurt her in so many ways.</p><p>At one time, Olivia had been responsible for bringing joy into Gilly\u2019s life. That\u2019s why, when Gilly ran away from home, she\u2019d led the teen to Los Angeles. On a level even Olivia hadn\u2019t understood, she\u2019d known Gilly would find salvation there. What she hadn\u2019t known then was that that salvation would be Danika and the Lords of the Underworld.</p><p>Her Deity worked in mysterious ways.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d she continued, \u201cI\u2019m not going back to the heavens.\u201d</p><p>Determination glinted in Aeron\u2019s eyes, but all he said was, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it later. Right now, as I told you, we have a job to do. You\u2019ve got time for a fast shower, but it\u2019ll have to be a multitasking one. I\u2019ve got questions for you, so we\u2019ll talk while you\u2019re cleaning up.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for her response, but scooped her up and carted her to the bathroom. There wasn\u2019t time to enjoy the ride. He set her down, severing all contact, bent over and worked the knobs in the stall. He had a nice butt, she observed, hugged just right by his jeans. And by \u201cnice\u201d she of course meant \u201cso exquisite her stomach fluttered.\u201d</p><p>Hot water suddenly burst from the spigot, startling her into averting her eyes. By the time she realized what she\u2019d done\u2014need more!\u2014he\u2019d already straightened. How disappointing. Or maybe not. That water promised strength, vitality and...her lids closed to half-mast. Fun, round two? Possibly. Her first shower, and Aeron would be an observer. Hopefully, he wouldn\u2019t be able to look without touching. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The morning was suddenly off to a much better start.</p><p>Desire trembled through her.</p><p>He turned to her and though he was the same height as always, he seemed larger, more menacing. His eyes glowed that bright violet, his tattoos stark, and the pulse in his neck hammered wildly. He wore a black shirt and black pants\u2014both easily removable\u2014and she could see the bulge of weapons at his waist and ankles.</p> <p>So beautiful, she thought, heart picking up speed. She wanted to stroke him again. Wanted to dance her lips over his entire body. Especially between his legs. When she\u2019d gripped him there, she\u2019d felt that bead of moisture.</p><p>What would that bead taste like?</p><p>He gulped. Had he sensed the direction of her thoughts? \u201cYou know how to take a shower, right? You...strip\u2014\u201d his voice caught on the word \u201c\u2014step under the water and lather the soap from head to toe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to join me?\u201d She pulled the tank over her head, letting the material float to the floor. Revealing her body should have made her uncomfortable, she supposed, but she wanted him to see and to yearn, just as she did. Unbearably. Besides, she was confident, aggressive, and now that she knew the kind of pleasure they could give each other, she would do anything, say anything, to receive it. \u201cOr are you just going to watch?\u201d</p><p>If that\u2019s the case, you can watch me do this. She cupped her breasts the way she suddenly imagined him cupping them, unable to stop herself. Oh, yes. That felt good.</p> <p>His eyes widened, seemingly glued to her, the air in the bathroom changing. Charging with electricity. \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d Harsh, choked.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause your Deity should be rewarded for creating those.\u201d He shook his head, though his narrowed gaze didn\u2019t leave her. \u201cI mean, because I\u2014 Damn you. And damn me. I should be punished. The thoughts in my mind...\u201d</p><p>Were they like hers? \u201cAeron,\u201d she beseeched.</p><p>\u201cI just realized I never kissed them,\u201d he uttered in a rough voice charged with the same electricity that hummed in the air. \u201cAnd gods, woman, that\u2019s a crime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss them now.\u201d Please.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d He leaned toward her, head bowing, pupils expanding\u2014and this time she knew it was desire rather than anger.</p><p>Her nipples pearled, waiting...expectant...but just before contact, he caught himself, straightened and growled. She released a breath she hadn\u2019t known she\u2019d been holding. He\u2019d almost... Sweet Deity. He really had almost kissed her there.</p><p>\u201cAeron.\u201d The ache such knowledge evoked... Do it. Don\u2019t stop now.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause!\u201d He knew what she craved, what she needed, yet denied her still. Just because. Bastard! \u201cYou do this alone.\u201d He passed her and stepped outside the bathroom, tugging the door shut behind him, leaving only a small crack of light.</p><p>So close...</p><p>She could have screamed, her skin suddenly too tight for her body. Instead, she removed the rest of her clothing and entered the stall. The moment that first cascade hit her, she wished she had screamed. Anything to ease some of the pressure building inside her. Pressure the soft caress of water merely provoked.</p> <p>She tried to blank her mind, but an array of words kept claiming her attention. Kiss. Breasts. Bodies. Moving. Kneading. Argh!</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hear you lathering,\u201d Aeron snapped.</p><p>\u201cGet bent,\u201d she snapped back, an expression she\u2019d heard humans utter to those who irritated them. And oh, did Aeron irritate her.</p><p>Kiss. Breasts. Bodies. Moving. Kneading. Sliding. Taking. Her knees almost buckled.</p><p>\u201cOlivia.\u201d A warning?</p><p>\u201cZip it, demon!\u201d Shaking, she pumped a few squirts of rose-scented soap ito her hands and finally began cleaning herself. Even that disturbed her, doubling the pressure. How had he revved her up this quickly and this intensely? Without kissing her?</p><p>Kiss. Breasts. Bodies. Moving. Kneading. Sliding. Taking. Possessing. Licking. Sucking.</p><p>Soon she would break.</p><p>Distraction. Yes, that\u2019s what she needed. \u201cDid Paris and William use this soap? And yes, you may speak now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know and it doesn\u2019t matter. You shouldn\u2019t be thinking about them. More than that, I\u2019ll be asking the questions here. How did you know we\u2019d fail to capture Scarlet yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I know a lot of things that can help you, but so far you haven\u2019t seemed interested in learning them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m interested now, so start talking. Are there any other demon-possessed immortals in town?\u201d</p><p>Confident, she reminded herself. \u201cYou think it\u2019s that easy?\u201d Aggressive. \u201cYou make a demand and I deliver?\u201d</p><p>A pause. A hesitant, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Relief! \u201cWe\u2019ll start with an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...sorry.\u201d</p><p>Grudgingly offered, greedily received. \u201cNo,\u201d she finally answered. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any other demon-possessed immortals in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. I\u2019ll need you to take me to where this Scarlet is staying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, sorry.\u201d Olivia twisted and turned under the water\u2019s spray, the bubbles running down and off her body. Kiss. Breasts\u2014Argh! \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>Another demand, uttered with such determination...determination that should have been annoying rather than sexy. Pressure mounting...again... \u201cWhy are you so eager for my aid now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to see the kind of life I lead. I want you to see the fights and the blood and the pain. I want you to see that I don\u2019t care about anyone other than my friends and Legion, and I will hurt anyone\u2014anyone\u2014who threatens them.\u201d</p><p>Anyone\u2014even Olivia? Even though he\u2019d chosen to help Olivia yesterday and send Legion away? Undoubtedly. Goodbye, pressure. Hello, emptiness. They had been cold, hard words, more vow than threat. He might not want to do so, but he wouldn\u2019t stop himself.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. If he wanted to spend the rest of his life showing her those things, she\u2019d let him. And she\u2019d return the favor! She\u2019d show him exactly what he\u2019d be missing if she left. Like the breasts he should be \u201cpunished\u201d for ignoring. Like the mouth that wanted so badly to suck on him.</p><p>Pressure...worse than before...</p><p>Breathe, she needed to breathe. She manipulated the knobs until the water shut off, the air around her instantly cooling her. Only, that failed to temper her needs. Little bumps broke out over her soaked skin, and she groaned. No more.</p><p>Perhaps she could give herself relief, she thought, intrigued. Aeron had used his fingers...and she did have fingers of her own... She licked her lips, heart pounding anew. He wouldn\u2019t have to know. She\u2019d turn the water back on, pretend to need more lathering, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cDone?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She tensed. \u201cI\u2014I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia, I believe I mentioned that I\u2019m pressed for time.\u201d</p><p>True. He wouldn\u2019t be alive much longer.</p><p>The reminder sobered her, chilled her desire as the air hadn\u2019t. She\u2019d thought she had accepted his coming death. But nine too-short days? That was hardly enough time to experience everything she wanted to experience with him. Especially as stubborn as he was being.</p><p>You\u2019ll have to make it enough.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said with a sigh, and stepped from the stall. Going with him now would also grant them more time together. And she supposed she wouldn\u2019t torture him with what he\u2019d never have, she thought sourly, hating to abandon so sweet a revenge. She supposed she\u2019d offer her breasts and her needy mouth\u2014and anything else he wanted\u2014without restraint.</p><p>In between the offerings, she could protect Aeron, as she\u2019d vowed to do, should anyone or thing threaten him.</p><p>\u201cAll right what?\u201d he asked, confused.</p><p>There was a toothbrush on the shower ledge, along with a tube of minty paste. Having seen humans perform the task a thousand times, she knew what to do and managed to brush her teeth without incident. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll show you where Scarlet lives.\u201d</p><p>Mouth fresh and clean, she grabbed the brush on the counter. The bristles caught on several tangles, making her grimace, but she didn\u2019t stop until her hair was smooth. Next time, she\u2019d remember to bring her robe with her even if she didn\u2019t plan to wear it.</p><p>\u201cWhat changed your mind?\u201d Suspicion dripped from each word.</p><p>\u201cArguing with you is a waste of precious time.\u201d True, if somewhat misleading.</p><p>\u201cA rational female. Who would have guessed?\u201d</p><p>She tossed the brush into the sink. \u201cAn insensitive male who won\u2019t get a kiss if he keeps that up.\u201d Again, true. And shocking. This vengeful side of her...she liked it.</p><p>Silence greeted her. Did that mean he craved another kiss? Despite her new affinity for tormenting, she tried not to hope too intently.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t hurt Legion, you know,\u201d she said. \u201cEven when she hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, angel, she hurts whenever you\u2019re near. Or she used to, when you had wings. But I never did, nor did the other warriors, and we\u2019re just as demonic as Legion is. Why was that? Were you doing it on purpose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Though it\u2019s true demons hate to be around angels, you\u2019ve managed to humanize yours. At least somewhat.\u201d Now. Enough talk about Legion, even though Olivia had been the one to bring her up this time. \u201cDo you want to know how to capture Scarlet or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYes. I do.\u201d</p><p>She fought a grin. Another apology. Just as grudging, but just as sweet. \u201cHere\u2019s what I know. Because she\u2019s possessed by Nightmares, she\u2019s weakened during the daylight hours.\u201d As she spoke, Olivia studied herself in the foggy mirror. There were bruises under her eyes and her cheeks were a bit hollowed. She only ever wanted Aeron to see her at her best, not like this, but it couldn\u2019t be helped. \u201cShe\u2019s like vampires in that regard. She sleeps during the day, her body too frail even to walk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aeron took a moment to absorb what she\u2019d said. \u201cWe\u2019ll capture her today, then, while she\u2019s sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the urgency? And what do you plan to do with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunters are in town. We\u2019ve found their hideout, and we now know they\u2019re being aided by Rhea, the god queen. We want to ask Scarlet a few questions, prevent her from helping the Hunters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could have told you they were in town, but you refused to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, and I\u2019m sorry about that, too. So what do you know about Rhea?\u201d</p><p>Yet another apology from him. The man deserved a reward. \u201cI know that she titled herself Mother Earth, and that she\u2019s aiding the Hunters,\u201d Olivia said, even though all she could think about was giving Aeron that reward. \u201cI know that she was weakened inside Tartarus, all the Titans were, and that\u2019s how the Greeks were able to get the demon of Strife to possess her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I had the information at my fingertips all along,\u201d he muttered. \u201cIf her demon is taken from her, will she die? Like us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo why is she helping the Hunters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the same reason Galen is leading them. They plan to kill you, and save themselves, then use your demons for their own gains. In Rhea\u2019s case, taking over the heavens and destroying Cronus once and for all.\u201d</p><p>If he had more questions, and she was sure that he did, he didn\u2019t allow himself to ask. Did he plan to go to his other source, whatever\u2014or whoever\u2014it was? And he did have a source. That much was clear. He hadn\u2019t been this knowledgeable before. If he did, he wouldn\u2019t need Olivia, and she hated the thought of that.</p><p>\u201cThank you for the information,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Push him. Be confident. Aggressive. Show him that he needs you for more than answers. \u201cI accept payment in the form of kisses. And anyway, I believe I owe you two. You apologized for your insensitivity, after all.\u201d</p><p>Aeron cleared his throat. \u201cYes, well, I never said I\u2019d pay you. Or accept payment. We, uh, need to leave.\u201d</p> <p>Disappointing man. \u201cJust let me\u2014\u201d Olivia glanced at the towel. If she donned it, she would be giving up, and she wasn\u2019t ready to give up.</p><p>She bit her lip as Gideon\u2019s words drifted through her head. Well, her translation of his words. Men liked naked women. Men had trouble resisting naked women. So no towel, she mused, nearly humming with anticipation.</p><p>Pressure...</p><p>\u201cNever mind,\u201d she said throatily. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>Arching her back to lift her chest\u2014he did like her breasts\u2014she gripped the doorknob and flung the door open fully. Confident. Aeron was leaning against the wall and had his back to her. His arms were still crossed over his chest. Unfortunately, he was still dressed.</p><p>Aggressive. They\u2019d just have to change that.</p><p>Naked and wet, she stepped in front of him, her heart drumming harder and faster than when she\u2019d considered touching herself. When he spotted her, his jaw dropped. His nostrils flared. His pupils practically exploded, the violet irises completely obscured.</p><p>Olivia almost moaned. Well, well. Gideon had been right. Aeron did like looking at a naked woman.</p> <p>Push harder. The ache...she needed him to assuage the ache... \u201cWhat do you think of my outfit?\u201d she asked, twirling.</p><p>Strangling sounds left his mouth.</p><p>She might never wear clothes again. \u201cI\u2019m human now and humans always demand payment for their services.\u201d Could he hear the excitement and nervousness in her voice? \u201cSo, if you want any more information from me\u2014and believe me, I have a lot to offer\u2014you\u2019ll have to earn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d The word was a snarl\u2014but that snarl wasn\u2019t laced with anger. \u201cWith those kisses you mentioned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the fee five minutes ago, and you refused to pay it. Therefore, my price has now gone up. If you want to know anything else, you\u2019ll have to warm me with your body. I\u2019m cold.\u201d I\u2019m so hot, I\u2019m on fire.</p><p>He gulped. Straightened. His gaze traveled the length of her, lingering on her breasts, between her thighs. His breathing became choppy, shallow. \u201cHoly hell. Dying. I\u2019m dying.\u201d</p><p>So am I. \u201cAeron.\u201d Give me. Take me.</p><p>\u201cThere...there isn\u2019t time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake time,\u201d she said, and closed the remaining distance between them. Must...touch...</p><p>He could have scooted her out of the way, and she wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop him, but he didn\u2019t. His big hands settled on her waist, his fingers digging deep. Finally!</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cTold myself I wouldn\u2019t, even though he won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe?\u201d More. \u201cWho won\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>At first, he gave no response, made no reply. \u201cMy...demon,\u201d he finally said in a hard tone, his fingers spreading to cover more ground. From lower back to buttocks, he touched her. Burned her. \u201cHe won\u2019t...hurt you. For once, I don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe,\u201d not \u201cit\u201d? What had changed between the two beings?</p><p>Who cared? Progress! \u201cSo why shouldn\u2019t you be with me?\u201d If he\u2019d hoped to dissuade her from this path, he never should have introduced her to passion. His mistake, and one she would take total advantage of. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any obstacles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObstacles...\u201d He floundered on the word, his gaze glued to her lips. \u201cWe are...\u201d</p><p>She flattened her palms on his chest, unwilling to listen to him rattle off an entire list of problems. As he\u2019d probably planned. His heart was drumming harder and faster than hers. A good sign. Still. Wanting it even harder, even faster, she arched her lower body into his and moaned. Oh, yes.</p><p>\u201cYou like getting answers, don\u2019t you, Aeron? That\u2019s important to you? For the good of you and your loved ones. Just pay me.\u201d</p><p>He licked his lips, leaving a glistening sheen of moisture. One taste, that\u2019s all she needed.... \u201cWho would have thought an angel would be such a manipulator?\u201d he asked huskily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fallen,\u201d she reminded him. Yet again. \u201cNow, enough talking. More paying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>He leaned down just as she rose on her tiptoes. Their lips smashed together, and at first, he didn\u2019t respond. She had to force her tongue past his clenched teeth, but the moment it touched his, he groaned and took over.</p><p>Oh, did he take over. His arms banded around her waist and hefted her up. She had to wind her legs around him and lock her ankles, otherwise she would have simply dangled there. The new position was delicious, exactly what she\u2019d needed, placing her aching core at the tip of his hard, thick erection. An erection peeking past the waist of his pants.</p><p>Stupid pants.</p><p>His hair, cut so close to his scalp, tickled her palms as she rubbed them up and down. One of his hands cupped the base of her neck and angled her head for deeper contact. Contact she felt through every inch of skin, every cell rushing through her veins, every bone screaming for more.</p><p>\u201cYou have on too many clothes,\u201d she told him between deep breaths.</p><p>\u201cNot enough,\u201d he shot back. His lips settled on her collarbone and sucked. Lower still. He licked a nipple, finally making good on his promise to kiss her there, and she moaned. His other hand moved to her neglected breast and massaged. \u201cI don\u2019t think a shield of armor would protect me from your appeal.\u201d</p><p>Such a sweet admission.</p><p>\u201cWe should slow down.\u201d</p><p>What? No! \u201cSpeed up.\u201d She twisted his ear, earning a growl.</p><p>Again he sucked on her other nipple, and the sting made her gasp\u2014then she moaned as he licked where he\u2019d nibbled. She arched into him, rubbing just the way she liked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get you all wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Bad thing, bad thing. The words were an echo in her brain, and she remembered how she\u2019d tried to lick his penis the last time they\u2019d kissed like this, but he hadn\u2019t let her. Had thought her too pure.</p><p>She dropped her legs, feet hitting soft carpet.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She sank to her knees, tugging at his pants until his shaft broke free. Thick, long, so magnificently hard.</p><p>\u201cOlivia...\u201d A moan, as if she tortured him. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth watered as she pressed her cheek into the satin-smooth flesh. Hot, imprinting. His fingers tangled in her hair. She pulled back only slightly, opened wide, then sucked him in. His girth stretched her jaw, an uncomfortable fit, but the salty-sweet taste of him thrilled her.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong. You should,\u201d he croaked out. \u201cYou really should.\u201d</p><p>Up and down she rode him with her mouth, hands playing with his heavy sac. She enjoyed him, enjoyed doing this, destroying his reluctance, spurring him into enthusiastic abandon. But he didn\u2019t let her take him all the way. All too soon, he gripped her shoulders and yanked her up.</p><p>\u201cNo more.\u201d Sweat glistened on his face as he swung her around and crowded her against the wall. Without a word, he next dropped to his knees. His strong hands parted her legs, and then he was there, licking at her, sucking on her, devouring her.</p><p>She needed an anchor, but couldn\u2019t find one as her hands clawed up and down the wall behind her. As her head thrashed from side to side. As her hair tickled her back. Everything was a stimulant. And she was close...so close...just needed...</p><p>He stormed to his feet, panting, lapping at the moisture she\u2019d left on his face, eyes at half-mast, liquid. \u201cWant to take you...can\u2019t take you...taste so good...need more...can\u2019t have more...\u201d</p><p>More. Yes. \u201cAeron.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, all hint of his resistance fading\u2014only to be replaced by determination. He reached between their bodies and stroked his erection. The other hand gripped her waist. \u201cCan\u2019t...can\u2019t...have to remember...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat? Remember what? Are you going to...are we going to...\u201d Please, please, please.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d He stilled. Their raspy pants were the only sound in the room, tangling together wildly, just as she wanted to be with him. \u201cCan\u2019t. We\u2019re going to\u2014\u201d Another growl. He tore his hand away from her to scrub down his face. As that hand descended, revealing his features, she saw the change in them. From determined to enraged. \u201cMost humans have to walk around unfulfilled. If you want to be a human, you should know how that feels.\u201d</p><p>Unfulfilled? She\u2019d rather die. \u201cTeach me next time. Please, Aeron.\u201d Too badly did she need him now. \u201cPlease.\u201d She arched her hips, back and forth, this time fitting her moist core against the hot steel of his freed shaft, a shaft she\u2019d tasted. Down she slid, up, down again. Oh, Deity. The pleasure...incomparable. Searing, thrilling...forbidden.</p> <p>Must have been the same for him because once more he shot into action. He cupped her bottom and slammed her into that shaft. Over and over, again and again. Not once did he penetrate her, but that didn\u2019t matter to her weeping body. What he was doing was too good, electrifying, and soon they were both groaning, panting more heavily, trembling.</p><p>Even their kiss spun out of control, their tongues dueling, rolling together, their teeth banging, scraping. Her nails clawed at him, at his hidden wings\u2014too wild? Gideon had said that Aeron needed a wild woman, but this might be too much, too fast for her warrior and she didn\u2019t want him pulling away.</p><p>Though it nearly cost her the last remnants of her sanity, Olivia tempered her touch, easing her nails out of his back, away from those sensitive slits.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cEnjoying you,\u201d she replied. \u201cOr I was, until you opened your mouth.\u201d</p> <p>He frowned, pulled his face away from hers so that he could peer into her eyes. \u201cWell, start enjoying again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d She bit her bottom lip and arched into him. \u201cBut I want your penis inside me first.\u201d</p><p>A strangling sound left him.</p><p>Again she arched. The tip of his shaft rubbed her clitoris, and she gasped. He hissed. So good. Soooo good. Her head fell back, and her wet hair swung, once more tickling her skin. So close, she thought. So close to that pinnacle of pleasure he\u2019d propelled her to the last time they\u2019d kissed like this. The pinnacle that would ease the pressure still building inside her, still torturing her.</p><p>\u201cAeron, Aeron. Just a little more,\u201d she rasped, \u201cand I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No!\u201d He released her, suddenly and without warning, and she fell off him. She hit the ground and lost her breath. That didn\u2019t dull her passion. Or ease her aches. \u201cCan\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>He wiped his shaky hand over his mouth, as if washing away the taste of her, briefly hiding the lines of tension banked there. Then he was refastening his pants with trembling fingers.</p><p>\u201cNo climaxing,\u201d he said in that harsh tone she so despised. Angry, rather than desire-filled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>His narrowing gaze settled on her, his expression like granite. \u201cI told you. Humans often experience unrequited yearnings. You want to be a human so badly, you can endure them, as well. Now get dressed. Like I also told you, we have somewhere to be.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>STRIDER HIT THE GROUND as a bullet whizzed past his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Gwen muttered with a grimace. Her red hair was pulled back in a ponytail and her silver-gold eyes were gleaming. \u201cI\u2019m having trouble channeling my dark side\u2014\u201d her Harpy \u201c\u2014so I thought I\u2019d better carry a gun.\u201dA gun that she\u2019d never worked with before. A Dead Hunter special he\u2019d augmented himself.</p><p>Damn, that\u2019d been close. Nearly taken out by friendly fire. And then things really would have gotten bad. Even though she wouldn\u2019t have meant to hit him, his demon would have seen it as a challenge. Gwen would have won, and he would\u2019ve been writhing on the ground for days, lost to the agony.</p> <p>As he\u2019d lost a challenge a few weeks ago to Hunters\u2014because Gwen and Sabin had let her father escape, something he was still trying to forgive them for\u2014the consequences of failure were vivid in his mind, and he wasn\u2019t eager to repeat the experience.</p><p>\u201cJust take your finger off the trigger,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where the Hunters ran off to and hid, and they don\u2019t know where we are. Gunshots could give away our location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Strider straightened. Glanced around. Lush, thick trees surrounded him and most of the others who\u2019d been at the temple with him\u2014and who, like him, had been whisked to...wherever the hell they were. Close to water, like before, that much he knew. He could hear the lull of the sea a few yards away, and golden sand sparkled at his feet and clung to his skin.</p><p>Amun and Maddox were currently scouting for signs of the enemy.</p><p>Evidently the Unspoken Ones\u2019 idea of a \u201cgift\u201d had been to whisk them and sixteen armed Hunters to a mysterious location. They\u2019d all been here twenty-four hours, had endured one full-on shoot-out, one scramble to safety to figure things out, and now this. Waiting. Searching. It was like the boxing matches Strider liked to watch on TV: the Lords in one corner, the Hunters in the other. So when was the freaking starting bell going to ring?</p><p>Soon, if he had his way.</p><p>His phone beeped, drawing his attention and signaling success. In one area at least.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d he said, punching a tree trunk in excitement. \u201cMy text finally went through to Lucien.\u201d He\u2019d been trying to contact his friends in Buda for most of the twenty-four hours with no luck. Either the powerful creatures had refused to let him make contact or cell towers were few and far between out here. His money was on the creatures. He needed Lucien to flash them more weapons and ammo. No way they\u2019d leave this place until every Hunter was captured. Or dead. He wasn\u2019t picky.</p><p>Now that the text had gone through, communication lines open, did that mean the Unspoken Ones were taking their hands out of the battle?</p><p>Only a few seconds later, his phone beeped again. He raised the screen to read Lucien\u2019s reply. Tried to flash to you. Something\u2019s blocking me.</p><p>Damn. Hands still in, just not as restricting.</p><p>He relayed the bad news to the others, scattered around him, and they groaned.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Sabin said. \u201cIf nothing else, Gwen can rip through them like a knife through silk.\u201d</p><p>Strider knew the statement wasn\u2019t a besotted husband\u2019s exaggerated boast, but the truth. When her dark side overtook her, Gwen could immobilize an immortal army on her own. Humans would be child\u2019s play.</p><p>\u201cOnly if my Harpy decides to show,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cWait. No only about it. She will. I\u2019ll make her.\u201d When it came to Sabin, she\u2019d do anything to protect him. A fact everyone in this little camp knew intimately, having been shredded by her Harpy\u2019s claws a time or two during training.</p><p>Don\u2019t worry, he typed, returning his attention to the phone. We\u2019ve got this.</p><p>Good news is, Galen\u2019s here in Buda and not among the group.</p><p>Surprising, since he\u2019d seen Galen in that vision. You guys good to go?</p><p>We\u2019ll be fine. But I should warn you, that bastard somehow got his hands on the Cloak. He could be in the fortress, and we\u2019d never know it.</p><p>Shit! This just got worse and worse. Galen had an artifact, and a powerful one at that. Soon as this was over, Strider would do whatever was necessary to steal it. Meanwhile, it was his turn to drop a bombshell. Looks like Hope\u2019s been a busy boy. I should warn YOU that Galen managed to merge the demon of Distrust with one of his soldiers. A female. We think he\u2019ll be out for blood now.</p><p>At first, Lucien didn\u2019t reply. Was probably battling shock as Strider and the others had. Distrust, the only thing left of Baden, was now in enemy hands.</p><p>Did Galen even need Pandora\u2019s box anymore? he wondered now. With the box, he could gather all the demons at once, without having to search for them later. So yeah, probably.</p><p>Finally, a new text came in. This is bad. Really bad. And I think it\u2019s only going to get worse. Aeron\u2019s called a meeting. Found something out. More from me when I know what that something is. Meanwhile, be careful.</p><p>You, too.</p><p>A twig snapped. Everyone stiffened, half immediately pointing their weapons in the direction of the noise and half aiming in the opposite direction, just in case. Amun and Maddox strode through the bush, and everyone relaxed. Amun was dragging a man, a human, behind him. Expression grim, he tossed the motionless body in the center of the camp.</p><p>As Maddox tied the man up, Amun signed what they\u2019d learned.</p><p>Strider had always admired Amun\u2019s ability to absorb memories. Sure, it left him with a new voice in his head each time he did so, but that seemed like a small price to pay for knowing the thoughts of everyone around you. As he\u2019d just taken a new crop of memories, though, Strider knew it would be a long time before he heard his friend speak again.</p><p>\u201cHunters set up camp about a mile north of us, and this guy was on guard duty. Their plan is to wait for us to attack them on their turf, where they can more easily injure us while remaining barricaded themselves,\u201d Sabin said, interpreting. Then he laughed without humor. \u201cWe all saw Distrust merge with that female. They won\u2019t just try to injure us. They\u2019ll be out for our heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGets better,\u201d Strider said, pocketing his phone. \u201cGalen\u2019s back in Buda, and he has the Cloak of Invisibility.\u201d</p><p>For several prolonged seconds, silence dominated their circle. Then he felt the vibrations of their anger as they considered the consequences. Then he heard their muttered curses.</p><p>\u201cObviously we can\u2019t stay here much longer, but just as obviously, we can\u2019t let these men go. Maddox can lead us to their camp, and we\u2019ll fight them on their turf just like they wanted.\u201d Sabin stood, hands clenched into fists. \u201cOnly, they won\u2019t like the results. We show no mercy. Take no prisoners.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Amid murmurs of agreement, Strider and the others pushed to their feet. Knives were palmed by Kane and Reyes. Guns were clutched by Gwen and himself. No, no, no. He crossed the small distance to stand in front of her and plucked the modified Sig Sauer from her fingers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She smiled sheepishly, then waved her clawed fingertips. \u201cI\u2019ll do better without it, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe all will.\u201d</p><p>Sabin hugged her tight. \u201cI\u2019ll help you summon your Harpy after Maddox gives us some direction. Maddox?\u201d</p><p>Maddox walked to the center of the group and knelt in the sand. He drew a misshapen circle. \u201cWe\u2019re on another island. We\u2019re here, and they\u2019re here.\u201d His fingertip danced through the golden grains. \u201cThe Unspoken Ones must have given them extra fortifications, because I found steel traps here, here and here.\u201d</p><p>Amun signed.</p><p>Again, Sabin translated for Maddox and Reyes, who hadn\u2019t spent the last few thousand years with the silent warrior. \u201cSleepy there,\u201d he said, pointing to the motionless Hunter, \u201cwas patrolling the perimeter of their camp with three others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf we split up, we can surround them and close in, a different warrior taking out each of the remaining guards while giving the others no room to run and hide.\u201d Strider would love nothing more than to pick them off himself, one by one, but there wasn\u2019t time.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Sabin said with a nod. He outlined who was to go where. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you have to scoot on your stomach. Don\u2019t let them see you. They\u2019re expecting us, as Sabin said, so the greater a surprise we manage to be, the better our chances of success. And once you spy their camp, don\u2019t move until you hear my signal. I want to let my demon at them before we attack.\u201d Doubt could turn even the bravest of warriors into thumb-sucking babies. \u201cMove as swiftly as you can. Let\u2019s reach them before they realize we\u2019ve already eliminated one of their own. If they haven\u2019t already.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Strider saluted and was off. For the most part, he loved this part of his life. Loved the challenge of battle, loved the rush of victory. Adrenaline always pumped through his veins, driving him faster, making him stronger. Like now. He dodged tree limbs and jumped over stones, all the while merging with the shadows.</p><p>Need a triumph, his demon whined.</p><p>Some Lords could hear their demons clearly; some simply felt their other half\u2019s desires. Strider only heard his before and after a battle. Perhaps that was because that was when Defeat was the strongest\u2014and the most worried.</p><p>I\u2019ll get you one. Promise.</p> <p>Sure?</p><p>What are you, Doubt? Yeah, I\u2019m sure.</p><p>Every so often, the sun would peek through the canopy of treetops and spill onto the ground like a spotlight. Out of habit, he spun until he once again met with shadows. Sadly, he wasn\u2019t one of the ones to run into a guard. Finally, though, he reached his destination and slowed. He was careful to avoid anything that might crunch beneath his boots. Then, hearing the murmur of unfamiliar voices, he lay down as ordered and inched his way to a bush bordering the Hunter camp.</p><p>All he saw was a wall of rocks, but there were gaps between several of those rocks, gun barrels peeking from them. Then he heard the whispers.</p><p>\u201cRick hasn\u2019t returned yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s only five minutes late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he got lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. The Lords of the Underworld are out there. Rick\u2019s already dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. I know you are. They have no morals, no conscience, so killing an innocent man wouldn\u2019t faze them. But damn, I really liked him.\u201d</p><p>Innocent? Please.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t wait for them to come to us. We should attack them. Obviously we\u2019ve got a god or two on our side. Our hideout appeared out of nowhere. Our guns and traps, too. Why else would we have been brought here with the Lords if not to finally destroy them?\u201d</p><p>Good question. These Hunters were supposed to be a gift, yet they\u2019d been armed and sheltered. Or maybe the battle was the gift. Not to the Lords, but to the Unspoken Ones. Maybe they enjoyed watching bloodshed.</p><p>One man must have stood, because suddenly Strider could see the top of his head. \u201cShut your fucking mouths, all of you. We\u2019re dealing with demons, the plague of our lives. We have to stay on alert.\u201d</p><p>Fanatics, Strider thought with disgust. They wanted someone to blame for their troubles. Understandable, he supposed, but wrong. Humans had free will. More often than not, that free will was the source of their troubles. They decided what they would eat, how much they would drink and who they would sleep with. They decided whether or not to do drugs or get in a car destined to crash.</p><p>\u201cWhat if\u2014what if they\u2019re too strong and we die out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want revenge for what we did to Lies, I know it. They\u2019re going to cut off our hands like we cut off his.\u201d</p><p>Strider fought a grin. Doubt was doing his job. Any second now and Sabin would\u2014</p><p>Sabin\u2019s whistle echoed.</p><p>Ding, ding. And there it was at last, the starting bell. Strider popped to his feet, the muzzles of both his guns outstretched. He aimed both at those gaps between the rocks and squeezed the triggers simultaneously. Pop, pop.</p><p>Screams erupted.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw Reyes dart from behind a tree trunk, sprint forward and climb the wall, tossing a knife along the way. There was another scream. Maddox sprinted forward as well, jumping over the wall with a single leap, gunfire ringing out. Only, Maddox hadn\u2019t carried a gun, Strider realized, stomach tightening. He was the target, using his body as a distraction.</p><p>Sabin quickly joined him and Kane attempted to do the same\u2014until a bullet somehow ricocheted off a rock and embedded in his shoulder. Figured. Kane cursed loud and long as Strider rounded the wall, disabling as many guns as he could through the holes.</p><p>Then a gust of lemon-scented wind ruffled Strider\u2019s hair, and he stilled. Gwen, he thought. And sure enough, he spotted the blur of her hair as she darted up the wall and fell inside the circle. Sabin had clearly made good on his promise. Strider followed on her heels, remaining on the edge of the highest ledge, weapon trained, just in case.</p><p>He needn\u2019t have bothered. The Harpy squawked, claws raking, sharpened teeth chomping. Men screamed and collapsed. A few tried to run, to scramble over the rocks. They didn\u2019t get far. As fast as the tiny wings on her back allowed her to move, she easily caught them and snapped their necks.</p><p>And just like that, the enemy was conquered.</p><p>Yes. Yes! Defeat sang inside his head.</p><p>Too easy, he thought. He hadn\u2019t even worked up a sweat. Not that he was complaining. Much. The harder the victory was to achieve, the better the rush afterward. Occasionally, if the victory was sweet enough, his demon writhed in pleasure for days. Hot damn, that was better than sex. Better than anything, really. He\u2019d only experienced such a thing twice, but he craved the next time like a drug.</p><p>Reyes and Maddox were bleeding profusely as they meandered through the masses, kicking away weapons. A few feet away, outside the enclosure, Strider heard the crunch of rocks and the snap of a twig. He turned, gun moving with him. He relaxed when he saw Kane settle against a tree trunk, trying to dig the bullet out of his shoulder. Disaster had had to mend himself from similar catastrophes a thousand times before, so he knew how to go about it.</p><p>Beside him was Amun, prone and writhing. The big guy must not ever have joined the fray. He\u2019d clearly remained at the sidelines, the memories he\u2019d stolen from that Hunter already overtaking him, demanding his attention.</p><p>\u201cGwen,\u201d Sabin called.</p><p>Once again, Strider\u2019s attention veered. A panting Gwen was pressed against the rocks. Blood coated her face and hands. All of the warriors had stepped away from her. All but Sabin. He was the only one capable of calming her down when her dark side overtook her.</p><p>As Sabin approached her, Strider joined the others in weaving through the fallen humans. Most were lifeless, silent. A few were moaning. He quickly aimed and fired, ending their misery. Except for one. That one, he crouched beside. There was something about the man...No, kid. Something about the kid that caused him to pause. And with the pause, reluctant compassion sparked to life.</p><p>That kid looked up at him through glazed eyes, realized who he was and scowled. \u201cBastard,\u201d he spat, blood spraying from his mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t think this is the end. I\u2019ll rise from the grave if necessary. I\u2019ll end you.\u201d</p><p>Such hatred seemed wrong in someone so young. The boy could be no more than twenty years old and had dark hair and eyes, reminding him of Reyes when they\u2019d lived in the heavens. There were cuts all over his face and holes in his left shoulder and stomach, both of which were gushing blood. They\u2019d decided to kill these Hunters, decided not to take any prisoners, but Strider suddenly found himself regretting that choice.</p><p>Which made no sense. If the kid had been able, he would have gutted Strider without hesitation. Still. His strength in the face of defeat was humbling.</p><p>With a sigh, Strider removed his T-shirt, ripped the fabric into two pieces and used the first to bind the kid\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d he ground out.</p><p>\u201cSaving your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you just tried to end it? No. Hell, no. I don\u2019t want to be saved by a demon.\u201d He tried to scoot away, but was too weak and shaky to get more than a few inches.</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d Strider used the other strip to apply pressure to his stomach. \u201cI never give Hunters what they want.\u201d</p><p>There was a tense pause. Then a weak, \u201cThis won\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I didn\u2019t want you to get the wrong idea.\u201d</p><p>Finally the kid gave up and just lay there as Strider bandaged him. Which was a good thing. The demon had begun to view their interaction as a challenge. \u201cSo what\u2019d we do to you to earn your eternal hate?\u201d</p><p>Eyelids that had been drifting closed snapped open. \u201cAs if you don\u2019t know,\u201d was the snarled reply.</p><p>Strider rolled his eyes. \u201cWhatever, dude. Just so you know, we can\u2019t be everywhere at once, and we have enough trouble with our own lives. There\u2019s no way we could have done whatever it is you think we\u2019ve done to those you love.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy name isn\u2019t dude, asshole.\u201d</p><p>Nice of him to ignore everything else Strider had said. \u201cWell, I thought it was better than calling you Holes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo to hell.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeen there, done that.\u201d</p><p>The kid ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cFine. You want to know the name of the man who will one day destroy you? It\u2019s Dominic. My name is Dominic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t recall asking what your name is. I don\u2019t really care,\u201d Strider said, and it was true. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve saved your sorry ass, you can deliver a message for me. Tell Galen we know about the girl. The demon-possessed girl, if you need more clarification.\u201d</p><p>Already pale, Dominic became chalk-white. \u201cI don\u2019t know...what you\u2019re talking...about.\u201d Blood loss had him gasping.</p><p>Yeah. Right.</p> <p>Multiple shadows suddenly fell over the prone human, and Strider glanced up. Most of the others had closed in and were surrounding them. Not a single one complained about his disobedience. Compassion clouded their features the same way it must have clouded his.</p><p>He returned his attention to the boy. \u201cAnd do yourself a favor,\u201d he said, finishing the patch job. \u201cWhen you get back to wherever your hidey-hole is, take a good long look at your leader. I know those wings of his make it seem like he\u2019s the angel he claims to be. But guess what? He\u2019s just like us\u2014demon-possessed. Only his demon happens to be Hope. Why do you think you feel so optimistic about the future every time you\u2019re in his presence? Why do you think you experience crushing disappointment every time you leave him? That\u2019s what he does, you know? The source of his strength. Building people up and tearing them down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No...wrong...\u201d Dominic\u2019s eyelids drifted closed. This time, they didn\u2019t open. There were lines of strain and pain branching from his eyes and mouth now, and hollows were already forming in his cheeks. He needed a transfusion, but with no medical supplies here, such a thing was impossible.</p><p>\u201cText Lucien and tell him to try flashing here again, wherever here is.\u201d Strider\u2019s hand clenched. He didn\u2019t want this jerk to die. Not after all his hard work.</p><p>There was a shuffle of clothing as Gwen did as he\u2019d asked. A few seconds later, she said, \u201cYes! He made it. He\u2019s at the temple and is going to follow our spiritual threads to reach us.\u201d</p><p>Lucien had been all over the world and could flash anywhere he desired. But he didn\u2019t know offhand exactly where someone he was tracking went. He had to follow the trails of energy they left behind in the spiritual plane.</p> <p>Strider cupped the human\u2019s jaw and shook. \u201cOpen your eyes, Dominic.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed. Nothing. He shook again. Dominic moaned.</p><p>\u201cOpen. Your. Eyes.\u201d He made sure to inject enough fury and menace into his tone to wake even the dead. Dominic had threatened to rise from the grave. No time like the present to prove he meant it.</p><p>The kid\u2019s eyelids finally cracked open. \u201cWhat d\u2019you want?\u201d was the groggy reply. His breathing was more labored, coming in short bursts.</p><p>\u201cSoon as he gets here, one of our men will be taking you to a hospital. You\u2019re going to live. And you\u2019re going to deliver that message I gave you. Oh, yeah. You want to know the name of the guy who just saved you? It\u2019s Strider. I\u2019d also consider it a personal favor if you let Galen know I\u2019m coming for him.\u201d And like Galen, Strider wouldn\u2019t show any mercy. Galen had made a mistake pairing Distrust with one of his soldiers, because now, Strider could kill Galen. And he could bind Hope with someone of his choosing.</p><p>Defeat laughed with glee. Game on.</p><p>Yes, Strider thought grimly. Game on.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p> <p>AERON SOARED THROUGH THE AIR, Olivia clutched in his arms. She had her own arms splayed, the wind whipping her hair in every direction. Every few seconds, she would sigh breathily and he would imagine her smiling. She had to miss flying.</p><p>\u201cHaving fun?\u201d he couldn\u2019t help but ask.She didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>She\u2019d been silent since leaving Gilly\u2019s apartment. Clearly, she was irritated with him. He\u2019d left her needy, after all, taking her to the edge of pleasure and then stopping before she could fall. But then, he was a fool. Why else would he have promised to show her the harsh realities of his life? Sooner rather than later? Something he couldn\u2019t do if he pleasured her every time she smiled at him. And sweetly begged him. And touched him.</p><p>Damned fool.</p><p>Her anger upset him, he would be lying if he said otherwise, but encouraging it was best. For both of them. When she surrendered, Legion would be able to return. Lysander would ensure Aeron and Legion were pardoned\u2014or try to. Aeron hadn\u2019t missed the implication. Still. It would have been nice to have Olivia... No. No. Nothing else mattered. Not Olivia, and not building some kind of life with her.</p><p>The thought alone was paradoxical. If she stayed, he would have no life. Only a handful of days.</p><p>Suddenly he could hear... His brow furrowed in confusion.... Was Wrath...whimpering? He listened more intently. Dear gods, the demon was. Because they couldn\u2019t have Olivia?</p><p>They were both fools, then.</p><p>When they reached the fortress, he landed on the front steps and set her on her feet, the main door looming just ahead. No way he\u2019d fly her through his bedroom again. Obviously, he couldn\u2019t have a bed and Olivia in the same vicinity without losing all common sense.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He grabbed her hand and dragged her into the foyer. Once again, she was wearing her long white robe. A robe that bagged on her, hiding all those sinful curves. He\u2019d flown to the fortress and retrieved the garment before flying back to her and bringing her here. A round trip that had been necessary for his own survival.</p><p>The woman was danger incarnate. When she\u2019d stepped from that shower, damp and naked and clearly eager for him, he\u2019d nearly died of pleasure, right then, right there. And the only thing he would have been sorry about had he died was that he wouldn\u2019t be able to see her like that again.</p><p>Her breasts were small but firm and her nipples that luscious plum. Her skin was like a fluffy cloud mixed with cream and sprinkled with ambrosia. And all that chocolate hair curling to her waist...better for me to fist it, he thought.</p><p>Which he\u2019d almost done, but somehow hadn\u2019t. She\u2019d moaned and writhed and begged him for more. Hell, Wrath had moaned and writhed and begged him for more. And he\u2019d come so close to giving in to both of them. But then Olivia had gentled her kiss and he\u2019d been disappointed and angry, and that volatile combination had thankfully snapped him into focus.</p><p>Yet, it shouldn\u2019t have been disappointment or anger that he\u2019d felt. He should have been overjoyed, but he\u2019d found himself wondering if her desire for him had waned. If she wanted someone else instead. Someone like Paris or William, both of whom she\u2019d mentioned while showering, hands caressing her own body, lingering. With the thought, he\u2019d once again yearned to have her completely out of control, because of him, sinking those nails into his back, scraping those teeth along his neck.</p><p>What was wrong with him?</p><p>\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d Olivia asked, tugging him from his dark and sensual musings. She slid her hand from his\u2014Mine, Wrath growled, no longer crying but once again claiming\u2014and stopped.</p><p>He\u2019d told himself he\u2019d protest these declarations from now on, but he couldn\u2019t force himself to do so. Fool. \u201cHear what?\u201d He, too, stopped and listened. Aside from his demon\u2019s continued brooding, only silence greeted him. Frowning, Aeron faced her. As always when he looked at her, his heart rate quickened. \u201cI hear nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the voice...\u201d She spun in a circle, gaze roving the foyer. \u201cIt\u2019s telling me to cup your balls with one hand and fist your cock with the other.\u201d</p><p>Was it possible she heard his demon and\u2014 Wait. What? \u201cA voice is telling you to molest me?\u201d Not Wrath, then. The demon had mentioned nothing that specific. Unfortunately.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this an attempt to seduce me?\u201d Tricky, delicious female, who wore scanty clothes, asked him naughty questions and emerged from the bathroom stark naked. \u201cIs this supposed to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I don\u2019t like this!\u201d she interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m hearing the words, thinking them, but they don\u2019t belong to me. I know that doesn\u2019t make any sense, but I don\u2019t know how else to describe it.\u201d</p><p>Behind him, footsteps resounded. He turned. Torin was halfway down the stairs, taking them two at a time. Today he wore a black turtleneck, black gloves and pants that dragged the ground so that even if he sat down and his socks fell below his ankles, not an inch of his skin would show.</p><p>\u201cDelicious,\u201d Aeron heard Olivia murmur. \u201cI could eat you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop saying things like that, Olivia.\u201d Aeron flicked her a glance\u2014only to still, grind his teeth and curse under his breath. She wasn\u2019t peering at him as he\u2019d expected; she was peering at Torin as if he was a piece of meat and she was starving.</p><p>Mine, Wrath warned.</p><p>Aeron popped his jaw in sudden irritation\u2014with Torin. It wasn\u2019t that he cared who Olivia desired. It was just that she\u2019d given up immortality for him, wanted him to provide her fun, wanted to welcome him inside her body; she shouldn\u2019t be so fickle.</p><p>\u201cUh, excuse me?\u201d A confused Torin stopped at the bottom of the staircase.</p><p>Aeron studied his friend, trying to see him as Olivia must. Beyond that startling contrast of white hair and black eyebrows, that smooth, naturally tanned\u2014and uninked\u2014skin, and okay, okay, maybe those piercing green eyes, he wasn\u2019t that attractive. What\u2019s more, he was an inch shorter than Aeron and not as bulky.</p><p>\u201cIgnore me,\u201d Olivia beseeched, horror drifting from her. \u201cPlease. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s come over me.\u201d</p><p>Torin, it seemed, was trying not to smile. \u201cGlad you\u2019re not scared of me anymore.\u201d</p><p>Aeron wished he could say the same. \u201cLet\u2019s get the meeting started.\u201d Surely that snapping, snarling tone wasn\u2019t his. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cToo late, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d Torin leaned one shoulder against the banister, the picture of domesticated male. Except for the wicked gleam in his eyes. \u201cEveryone\u2019s left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one with big news. Lucien flashed to Rome after Sabin and the others learned that Galen succeeded in binding Distrust to one of his soldiers. A female.\u201d</p> <p>Aeron plowed a hand over his razored hair. Distrust, Baden\u2019s Distrust, was now inside a Hunter? He\u2019d known Galen hoped to do such a thing, but still the knowledge stunned him. Unacceptable!</p><p>Punish, Wrath agreed.</p><p>No images flashed in his mind, but Aeron wasn\u2019t surprised. He was becoming used to his demon\u2019s more vocal presence. \u201cSomething will have to be done about that, but we\u2019ll have to tread carefully. Today I learned that Rhea, Cronus\u2019s wife, is aiding the Hunters.\u201d</p><p>Torin absorbed the words and paled. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia clasped Aeron\u2019s hand, twining their fingers. Wrath\u2019s anger drained, leaving Aeron with a cuddly kitten. He favored the rage. \u201cIf there\u2019s anything I can do to help, please let me know,\u201d she said. \u201cI won\u2019t even make you pay for it.\u201d</p><p>Her attempt to comfort him was...comforting. Damn it! Now he was like Wrath. Cuddly. And he didn\u2019t like it. But he liked her. More than he should have. He was used to bottling up his emotions, ignoring them so he could focus on what needed to be done, but she refused to accept anything but his complete capitulation.</p><p>Maybe that was why\u2014realization hit him hard. Shit. It was. That\u2019s why he\u2019d always preferred gentle women. Well, not preferred, but feared the other, stronger females. Gentle women didn\u2019t threaten to break the bottle that contained all those churning emotions. Stronger women could smash that bottle to pieces, forcing him to feel.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Torin asked, head tilting to the side.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he lied. No way he\u2019d admit to such a weakness. \u201cSo look. Back to the Hunters. Rhea is hiding them from us while they\u2019re in town.\u201d</p><p>Torin\u2019s lips pulled back from his teeth. \u201cFirst we learn Galen\u2019s leading the Hunters, and now a Titan is helping them, too. If there are more surprises, I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, Cronus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust visited me,\u201d Torin interjected, \u201cbut he conveniently didn\u2019t mention any of this. He just commanded us to get our asses in gear and find Scarlet, which is where the others are. Looking for her. He threatened us with the usual death and destruction if we failed to find her. Today.\u201d</p><p>The god king was certainly making the rounds, first visiting Aeron, then Torin. But why would finding Scarlet be so important to him? To ensure Rhea didn\u2019t get to her first?</p><p>Olivia\u2019s fingers squeezed his as she focused on Torin. \u201cLooks like I can help, after all. Aeron wants me to show you where she\u2019s staying, and I agreed to do so.\u201d</p><p>Torin studied her closely. \u201cYeah, Cameo mentioned something about you knowing the girl.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d said Cameo\u2019s name, his expression had softened. Interesting. Was it true, as some of the warriors suspected, that those two were involved? They couldn\u2019t touch one another, so, if they were lovers, they would\u2019ve had to find other ways to please each other.</p><p>Aeron couldn\u2019t imagine being unable to touch and taste Olivia. He couldn\u2019t\u2014focus, clearly.</p><p>\u201cTell him,\u201d he said to Olivia, forcing himself back on track.</p> <p>She squared her shoulders and spouted off the location. That quick, that easy. If only.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll text everyone,\u201d Torin said, relief dripping from the words. He didn\u2019t ask how Olivia knew, nor did he accuse her of trying to trick him. Even without that ring of truth in her voice, he would have trusted Aeron\u2019s judgment.</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t tell them where she is,\u201d Aeron said. He flicked a glance to the nearest window. The curtains were drawn, but there was a tiny sliver of open space between the two panels, allowing the barest hint of sunlight to seep inside. Darkness wouldn\u2019t fall for hours yet, which meant Scarlet was sleeping. \u201cTell them to come home. Olivia and I will take care of Nightmares. With Hunters in Buda and in possession of an artifact, I want as many warriors as possible here at all times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone. Any way I can convince you to take a warrior or two with you, though? Backup\u2019s a great thing to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t need any. She\u2019ll be sleeping until nightfall and no trouble. Right, Olivia?\u201d</p><p>The angel nodded reluctantly. She clearly didn\u2019t like sharing information with anyone but him, but was doing so. For Aeron. Perhaps he could forgive her for her earlier fickleness.</p><p>Wrath went silent, for once not objecting to the thought of forgiveness\u2014a concept that usually confused the demon.</p><p>\u201cOh, and I know you didn\u2019t want any more surprises tossed your way, but there\u2019s one more thing I\u2019ve got to tell you about your buddy Cronus,\u201d Aeron said. \u201cTurns out we have more in common than our mutual dislike of Galen.\u201d</p><p>Torin frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Only merciful way to do this was to say it quick. \u201cHe\u2019s possessed by the demon of Greed.\u201d</p><p>First, Torin\u2019s mouth fell open. Then his eyes widened. Then he stumbled back, hit the bottom step and nearly fell. \u201cThe god king is demon-possessed? How can you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLysander paid me a visit.\u201d Like him, Torin now knew angels couldn\u2019t lie. \u201cCronus was locked in Tartarus at the time we opened the box, so it makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Just wow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrow in an oh, shit and you\u2019ve got my initial reaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did Lysander visit you?\u201d Olivia asked. \u201cWhat else did he say? Did he mention me? I know he mentioned me.\u201d Before Aeron could respond, she added, \u201cAnd do you want to have sex before we leave?\u201d She shook her head, as if she couldn\u2019t be sure she\u2019d heard herself correctly. \u201cDid I just ask you if you wanted to have sex with me?\u201d</p><p>She had, and his body had reacted accordingly. He nodded because he didn\u2019t trust himself to speak.</p><p>The horror he\u2019d heard in her voice a little while ago now flooded her features. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t say it. I mean, I did say it, and I want to do it, but that wasn\u2019t me. The voice...\u201d</p><p>Torin\u2019s grin was all cat and cream. \u201cSo are you talking to Aeron or to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo me,\u201d Aeron barked, even as she said, \u201cTo you, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Aeron and Wrath shouted in unison.</p><p>Mine!</p><p>Torin laughed, the bastard. \u201cWish I could, angel, but I really would kill you with my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed, giving her skin a luminous glow.</p><p>Aeron\u2019s teeth did that grinding thing again. \u201cYou better tell that voice of yours to shut the hell up.\u201d Was someone speaking through her? Lysander certainly had the power to do so, but the warrior angel wouldn\u2019t say those kinds of things. Sabin, too, could do it, but he wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>Who did that leave? Cronus? Rhea? But why would it be either of them?</p><p>Olivia\u2019s shoulders straightened, her chin lifting in a way he now knew meant her stubborn streak had kicked in, and she glared up at him. \u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t the voice that time. Maybe it was me. You\u2019re not as fun as I thought you\u2019d be. You don\u2019t even know how to give me a proper orgasm.\u201d</p><p>Torin barked out another laugh, and it was Aeron\u2019s turn to flush. \u201cI could have given you one if I\u2019d wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well,\u201d she huffed. \u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>Yes!</p><p>A growl sprang from deep in his throat and he stepped closer to her, leaned down and put them nose to nose. Give her an orgasm? There was nothing he wanted more. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t careful, you\u2019re going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAeron, Aeron,\u201d a familiar voice called.</p><p>Aeron jerked upright as if he\u2019d been caught doing something he shouldn\u2019t. Actually, he had. Legion was here. How could he have forgotten about her? About her safety? He should have been out there looking for her instead of responding to Olivia\u2019s taunts.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to my room to summon Cronus again before the mud-wrestling starts,\u201d Torin said. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll show, maybe he won\u2019t. If he does, I\u2019ll ask him why he\u2019s not listed on the scrolls and if he can block us from Hunters. I\u2019ll let you know how it goes. See you guys later. Oh, and, Olivia. Good luck with that voice.\u201d With a wink in her direction, he turned on his heel and popped back up the stairs.</p><p>Touch what\u2019s mine and pay with\u2014</p><p>Will you stop warning him away? Aeron snapped at his demon. He can\u2019t hear you. But don\u2019t stop staking that claim, he almost added. Such a fool.</p><p>A second later, Legion plowed around the far corner, red eyes wild. She halted when she spied Aeron, hissed when she saw Olivia, then tripped forward until she was standing in front of them. She was panting, sweating.</p><p>Instinctively, he moved in front of Olivia. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked, guilt consuming him. If she\u2019d gotten hurt because of him...</p><p>\u201cEverything will...be...better sssoon...\u201d The moment the last word left her mouth, her knees collapsed and she tumbled to the floor.</p><p>Aeron reached out, catching her before she hit and easing her down. She was so tiny, her weight barely registered.</p><p>\u201cAeron,\u201d she said on a sigh of relief\u2014just before curling into herself with a pained grunt.</p><p>\u201cLegion,\u201d he said, panic sprouting. \u201cTell me what\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Another grunt. Every muscle she possessed began knotting and relaxing, knotting and relaxing. Her body seemed to be...growing? Not possible. Or shouldn\u2019t have been. As he watched, her arms, legs and torso lengthened. Her scales even began to fall away like dew drops, leaving beautiful, golden skin in their wake.</p><p>Soon, though, the grunts became never-ending screams. And with her mouth open so wide, he could see that her teeth were shrinking, her forked tongue weaving together. Next, blond hair sprouted from her scalp and large breasts plumped from her chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the hell is happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s becoming...human,\u201d Olivia whispered. Her words, so much softer than his, still managed to rival his in shock and horror.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, Aeron popped to his feet and rushed around the corner. When he reached one of the living rooms, he grabbed a blanket slung over the couch. His mind churned with so many questions, he couldn\u2019t quite process what was happening. Legion. Human. Why? How?</p> <p>At her side once more, he draped the blanket over her bare skin. She\u2019d stopped growing, at least. Stopped spasming and screaming, too. Tears streaked her cheeks and her bottom lip trembled.</p><p>She gazed up at him with dark, liquid eyes, no hint of demon red. \u201cAeron,\u201d she said on a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m...so...happy to...see...you.\u201d</p><p>No longer did she sound like a child, all hint of her lisp gone. Though her words were hesitant, as if she didn\u2019t quite know how to use her tongue, she sounded like an adult, voice rich and husky.</p><p>Flabbergasted, he crouched beside her and smoothed the hair from her brow. \u201cTell me how this happened,\u201d he said as gently as he was able. He didn\u2019t want to spook her.</p><p>She reached up with a shaky arm and traced her fingertips over his lips, his jaw. \u201cSo beautiful, my Aeron is.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time since he\u2019d met Legion, he wanted to pull away from her embrace. He loved her, he truly did, but the adoration on her new face\u2014adoration he\u2019d seen a hundred times before, had once craved\u2014was now...wrong. Because, without the glow of red in her eyes, he saw the sensual yearning banked there.</p><p>Dear gods.</p><p>She was a feast for the eyes, prettier than Olivia even. Skin like honey, eyes like cinnamon and lips as red as berries. Her nose was small and pert and her eyebrows perfectly arched. There wasn\u2019t a flaw to her. But...</p><p>His blood didn\u2019t heat, his fingers didn\u2019t tingle where he\u2019d touched her and the thought of removing the blanket to peek at her curves was truly repugnant to him. He would rather gouge out his eyes. And while Wrath liked this girl as he had liked the old Legion, the demon was quiet, not staking a claim.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one way this could\u2019ve happened,\u201d Olivia said with so much dread Aeron\u2019s stomach clenched. \u201cShe made a deal with Lucifer.\u201d</p><p>A deal with the devil? For what? She already possessed everything her heart could desire. \u201cIs that true?\u201d And if so, what did it mean for her? For him? What could Lucifer have demanded in return?</p> <p>Wrath leapt into motion, prowling back and forth inside his head. There were no images flashing, at least, but the demon was suddenly restless, as if he didn\u2019t like what was going on.</p><p>Legion glared up at Olivia. \u201cOf course it isn\u2019t...true. I would never do...such a despicable thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie,\u201d Olivia replied. \u201cI can hear the untruth in your voice.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t, but he could hear the truth in Olivia\u2019s. Still. He didn\u2019t know who to believe. Legion, whom he loved. Or Olivia, whom he hungered for but couldn\u2019t have.</p><p>Gingerly, Legion sat up, and the blanket fell to her waist. Aeron hastily looked away, but not before he\u2019d caught a glimpse of her pearled nipples.</p><p>He wanted to scrub his corneas with sandpaper.</p><p>Would this day never end?</p><p>OLIVIA WATCHED as Legion held out one arm, looked it over, then held out the other and examined it, as well. She cupped her breasts, pinched her nipples and gasped in awe.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m gorgeous,\u201d she said excitedly. Her words were emerging more fluidly now, smoother every time she spoke. She must be getting used to her new tongue. Her gaze lifted, smugness banked there as she met Olivia\u2019s eyes. \u201cI\u2019m a thousand times prettier than you are.\u201dMaybe she was. Not that Olivia cared. Much. What did Aeron think about this? He was careful not to face Legion, careful not to touch her.</p><p>Kiss the back of his neck...lick it...and let Legion see you do it.</p><p>Olivia stopped breathing. There it was again. The voice. The temptation. Ever since Aeron had dragged her back to this fortress, it had been tormenting her, urging her to do all manner of things\u2014all designed to lure Aeron into bed with her. Caress his penis, strip and dance for him, even flirt with his friend to drive him insane with jealousy.</p><p>None of which would have bothered her. Except the desires hadn\u2019t sprung from her. Yes, she wanted to caress his penis, and yes, she wanted to strip for him. As evidenced by the fact that she\u2019d last approached him naked. And yes, she even liked the thought of his jealousy. But when the voice produced the desires, patches of darkness were left on her soul. She could feel them.</p><p>How was that happening? What was happening?</p><p>Aeron cleared his throat, tugging her from her thoughts. \u201cLet\u2019s get you some clothes, Legion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like being naked,\u201d she said with a pout.</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d Still keeping his gaze averted, he held out a hand. \u201cLatch on and I\u2019ll pull you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Watching Olivia, she drew herself up, threw her arms around Aeron\u2019s neck and pressed herself into the hard line of his body. \u201cI want you to carry me.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced, but scooped her up. \u201cAll right. Olivia, come with us. Please.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for her reply, but trudged up the steps.</p><p>No way she would have left him alone with the demon-turned-human, but she was gratified that he\u2019d requested her company. Until, halfway to his room, she heard, Pat his ass...and actually found her fingers inches from his bottom before she even realized she\u2019d reached out. She scowled and forced her arm to fall to her side, but it was too late. Another patch of darkness had already bloomed.</p><p>What would happen if that darkness consumed her?</p><p>Stop, she shouted inside her head. Whoever, whatever you are, please stop.</p><p>Legion rested her head on Aeron\u2019s shoulder, gaze returning to Olivia, and stroked the contours of his back. \u201cSo strong,\u201d she purred.</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyes narrowed as rage infused every atom of her being. He\u2019s mine to stroke. Mine to praise.</p><p>Do something. You deserve Aeron, not Legion. So prove it to him. Get in front of him, drop to your knees, open his pants and suck his cock into your mouth.</p><p>She tripped over her own feet, rage quickly draining and leaving only despair. What would happen if the darkness consumed her? she had wondered. With this newest urging, the answer had slid into place. She would no longer be able to distinguish her own desires and emotions from those of the voice. What the voice had said, she wanted to do. Desperately.</p><p>Resist. She couldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>\u201cI want to talk with you...privately,\u201d Legion continued, and that slight pause at the end had had nothing to do with her tongue and everything to do with sensual suggestion. \u201cSend the ugly angel away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d he barked. Then more calmly, \u201cYou have to stop.\u201d</p><p>Finally the smugness drained from her and she turned a now-watery gaze to Aeron. \u201cDon\u2019t you love me anymore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do, but that doesn\u2019t mean... We can\u2019t...Damn this!\u201d He snaked the corner, stalked down the hall and practically kicked his door from its hinges. He set Legion on her feet and backed out of the chamber. \u201cTake anything of mine you want, just get dressed.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for her reply, but shut the door with a firm snap and whirled on Olivia. \u201cTell me about her deal with Lucifer.\u201d</p><p>Drop to your knees...</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d One step, two, she backed away from him.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d Aeron said, scowling. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Kiss him, then...somewhere, anywhere...</p><p>Her attention fell to his lips, and she licked her own. A kiss, so innocent. So necessary. Must...resist...</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d he barked again.</p><p>She gulped. \u201cStop what?\u201d Beyond the door, she could hear Legion stomping around, tossing things to the floor and muttering about \u201cstupid angels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne, denying my command and two, trying to seduce me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I try to seduce you? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re any good at the actual bedding.\u201d The moment the words escaped her, she plastered her hand over her mouth. Truly. How was this happening? she wondered again. That hadn\u2019t been her taunt, but the voice\u2019s.</p><p>Aeron bristled. \u201cNot good? I gave you an orgasm the first time we...just the first time, damn it!\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened as realization struck. Another danger the voice presented: she liked the results. Aeron barely had a leash on his anger, and the thought of him out of control, determined to prove just how good he was at pleasing her, thrilled her.</p><p>Resist? Perhaps that wasn\u2019t such a good idea.</p><p>Really? Well, if that\u2019s the case, Aeron will fall for the voice, not you. Is that what you want? Finally. Rational thought. Thought that cracked through some of the darkness, allowing light to seep inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do about your little demon friend in there?\u201d she asked him, returning to the only subject that mattered at the moment.</p><p>Aeron scrubbed a hand down his suddenly tired expression. He\u2019d been doing that a lot lately. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make a bargain of this magnitude, she would\u2019ve had to promise something huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Olivia shrugged. \u201cOnly she knows the answer to that. Well, and Lucifer, but I guarantee he won\u2019t tell us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know she bargained with Lucifer rather than Hades? And does the bargainer matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the bargainer matters, but Hades is currently locked away and incapable of making such deals, so you don\u2019t have to worry about him.\u201d When the Titans escaped their immortal prison and overthrew the Greeks all those months ago, Hades had been included in their number. Lucifer, though, the Titans had left alone. Someone needed to be in charge of the underworld, she supposed. Even someone as vile as the devil, the creator of evil. Better him than the insane Hades, though.</p><p>Rub your body against his... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Any more of this, and she was going to bang her head into the wall until she passed out. No more darkness, no matter how much she liked the results. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do it, even though I want to, so you can just hush.\u201d</p><p>Aeron tossed up his arms, a man who\u2019d said goodbye to the last of his patience. \u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Just, well, until you know more about Legion\u2019s end of the bargain, I wouldn\u2019t trust her. She could have shared secrets, promised to kill one of your friends.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head, suddenly confident. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t do that. She loves me.\u201d</p><p>His faith in a conniving demon was irritating. Why couldn\u2019t he feel that way about Olivia, a former angel who never, ever lied? Why did he constantly try to push her away?</p><p>The bedroom door swung open, and Aeron stumbled backward. Legion caught him with a husky laugh. He quickly straightened and turned. She was wearing one of his T-shirts and a pair of his sweatpants and both bagged on her.</p><p>\u201cHappy now?\u201d she asked, twirling on her tiptoes. \u201cThis is...all I could find. But you know...what the funny thing is? I still...look good.\u201d In her exuberance, the hesitant pauses returned to her speech.</p><p>He backed away from her and into Olivia. Olivia flattened her palms on his shoulder blades to keep him from running, her heart picking up speed. Contact.</p> <p>\u201cOlivia and I have to go into town. You\u2019re going to stay here. And I mean it this time. Do not go anywhere. I need to talk to you when I return.\u201d</p><p>Her siren\u2019s smile quickly faded. \u201cWhat! No. Hell, no. I\u2019m going...with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying, and there\u2019ll be no arguing about it.\u201d</p><p>Expression petulant, she stomped her foot. \u201cWhy are you...taking the ugly angel then?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not ugly!</p><p>\u201cI need her,\u201d was all Aeron said, but there was steel in his voice. Boiling steel.</p> <p>Breath hissed between Legion\u2019s teeth as she leveled her gaze on Olivia, who was still peeking around Aeron\u2019s side. There was more hate in those eyes than Olivia had ever seen. \u201cTouch him, and I\u2019ll...kill you. Under...stand?\u201d The more intense her emotions, the more trouble she had speaking, it seemed.</p><p>\u201cYou will not harm her.\u201d Without pivoting an inch, Aeron wrapped a hard arm around Olivia\u2019s waist, his fingers digging into her lower back. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no more threats. Do you understand? I won\u2019t tolerate it.\u201d</p><p>Legion pressed her lips together, and a moment passed in silence. Then she smiled. A forced, too-sweet smile. \u201cAny...thing you say, Aeron. I love you and...only want you happy.\u201d</p><p>A lie. Olivia heard it in the undercurrents of the demon\u2019s voice. Not about the demon\u2019s love for Aeron, but about her promise to leave Olivia alone. She would have to be on guard, for she\u2019d seen demons at work and knew firsthand how insidious they were, how much destruction they could wreak.</p><p>\u201cTry,\u201d she said, and whether the challenge came from her or that tempting voice, she didn\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t care just then. \u201cBecause I plan to do a lot more than simply touch him.\u201d Truth.</p><p>Aeron swung around, pinning her in place with his probing stare. His pupils were dilated, just as they\u2019d been before he\u2019d kissed her back at Gilly\u2019s, his chest moving up and down as if he couldn\u2019t quite catch his breath. \u201cNot. Another. Word. From. Either. Of. You,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>Kiss him...</p><p>For once, she didn\u2019t resist. Darkness be damned, she closed the distance between them, rose on her tiptoes and planted her lips against his. Legion needed to know Olivia was just as determined as she was to win this man. To have him in every way imaginable.</p> <p>Her tongue pushed inside his mouth, but only briefly. Only long enough for a taste. He opened up, clearly wanting more, which surprised her and heightened her desire, but she forced herself to straighten and spin away.</p><p>\u201cCome, Aeron,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have things to do. Together.\u201d Without a backward glance at either Aeron or the now-cursing Legion, she strolled away as if she didn\u2019t dread facing the rest of the day.</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>\u201cI CAN\u2019T SEE ANYTHING,\u201d Aeron whispered an hour later. \u201cIt\u2019s too dark.\u201d An unnatural darkness, at that. There wasn\u2019t a speck of light, and the flashlight he\u2019d brought with him highlighted nothing, merely disappearing into the yawning thickness of gloom.</p><p>\u201cThe night Lysander appeared to me, he told me I would remain an angel in all the ways that mattered until my time expired,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI think I can\u2014\u201d\u201cShh. Inside voice.\u201d He didn\u2019t want her to become a target. In fact, the thought enraged him, but he only had himself to blame. He shouldn\u2019t have brought her here, whether Nightmares was a threat or not. He just\u2014he hadn\u2019t wanted to leave her within striking distance of Legion. Or touching distance of Torin. And he had promised to show Olivia the harsh realities of his life.</p><p>I\u2019m such a fool. A fool drowning in a storm of his own making. Desire for Olivia\u2014check, that hadn\u2019t lessened. Had only grown. A jealous, bloodthirsty pseudo-daughter determined to end his angel\u2014check. A vow to convince said angel to return home\u2014check, even though he now hated himself for that vow. Send her away, never knowing how she fared? Torture!</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sleeping,\u201d Olivia said, and that, too, was stated at top volume.</p><p>\u201cShe can awaken,\u201d he gritted out. He\u2019d never minded the dark, but as he inched down the steps and felt his way along the walls of Scarlet\u2019s home, which just happened to be an underground crypt in the local cemetery, bumping into\u2014furniture? coffins?\u2014and having no idea what waited ahead, the possibility of leading Olivia into slaughter caused tendrils of fear to blend with his rage. How could he protect her like this?</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t awaken, I promise. Anyway. As my time has not yet expired, maybe I can...\u201d</p><p>As Olivia\u2019s words trailed off, he stopped, pivoted. She knocked into him and humphed. Even though he\u2019d felt her only briefly, he savored the contact. Soft, warm. Exhilarating. That\u2019s all his body needed to ready itself. Again.</p><p>Mine, Wrath said.</p><p>I know. You\u2019ve told me. Over and freaking over again. And Aeron had let him, had stopped caring. Because...No. Don\u2019t go there.</p><p>A moment passed in silence, their breathing the only sound. The air was musty, thick with age, dust and death, but he would\u2019ve been content to wait here forever. Here, she was safe. Here, they were together.</p><p>\u201cCan what?\u201d he finally prompted.</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Pinpricks of light flickered.</p><p>He blinked, rubbed his eyes. Those pinpricks were actually sparking off her skin, he realized, blending together and growing in intensity. Growing so much she was soon chasing away the shadows and his eyes were tearing.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014\u201d</p><p>Slowly she grinned, her beautiful face illuminated, shining like the purest star, those dark lashes framing those sky-blue eyes. He could have kissed the breath right out of her. Don\u2019t you dare. But now that he knew her taste, now that he\u2019d felt her rub against him, how was he supposed to resist?</p><p>Legion. Lysander. Freedom.</p><p>Oh, yeah. He could have cursed.</p><p>\u201cHumans were sometimes trapped in darkness, and I had to show them the way out.\u201d Olivia shifted from one foot to the other, and motioned behind him with a tilt of her chin. \u201cScarlet is just around the corner. I can sense her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Motions stiff, Aeron forced himself to turn away. His eyes immediately mourned the loss of her.</p><p>Wrath, too, howled in protest.</p><p>Calm. We\u2019re still with her. Aeron led his charge down the correct dirt path and soon found himself standing in a makeshift bedroom. Pikes sprung from several places in the floor, gleaming sharply and anchored firmly by concrete. Between them were trip wires, and at the far end of the room, guarded by the entire fun zone, was a coffin.</p><p>Why a coffin? Because she could close herself in for better protection? Smart woman, if so.</p><p>He palmed a blade and closed the distance, dodging those pikes. Olivia stayed close to his heels, every step measured.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d he muttered. \u201cStay behind me.\u201d He flipped open the lid, halfway expecting a fight.</p><p>Nope. As Olivia had promised, Scarlet slept peacefully, completely unaware of his intrusion. He studied her. Silky black hair framed her seemingly delicate face. She hadn\u2019t looked delicate before, when she\u2019d cornered him in that alley. Her lashes were longer than he\u2019d realized, like feathered fans reaching for her cheekbones. She had a small nose, and her lips were redder than before.</p><p>She wore a T-shirt and jeans, both black, and weapons were strapped all over her body. She didn\u2019t disarm, even to sleep. Interesting. Even he removed his blades before crawling into bed. He kept them nearby, of course, but not on him.</p><p>Relaxing, his gaze shifted. The walls were dirt, just like the floor, and there were blades peeking from several locations. Anyone who fell, either into the wall or onto the floor, would tumble straight to their death.</p><p>Nightmares could have placed traps at the doorway or even on the steps leading down here, but hadn\u2019t. Why? Perhaps she\u2019d known the unerring gloom would frighten most people\u2014most innocents\u2014away. But the ones who persisted, the ones who kept going, would clearly have more sinister intentions. Perhaps those were the only people she wanted to hurt.</p><p>If that were the case, that would mean she killed discriminately. That would mean there was a line she wouldn\u2019t cross. Or perhaps she just liked the kills to be made nearby, so that the first thing she would see when she awoke was blood and death.</p><p>Either way, the woman was serious about protecting herself.</p><p>He almost hoped she would rouse and attack him. He needed a battle. His nerves were on edge and bloodshed would have calmed him. Too many things were happening, changing. Too many things were going wrong.</p><p>Baden\u2019s demon finding a new host, thanks to Galen. Discovering Cronus and Rhea were possessed. Everything with Olivia, of course, and her naughty clothes and searing kisses, with her irresistible suggestions (just then, he almost missed the voice) and her attempted seduction of another man, all of which were like matches on the kindling of his arousal. And jealousy. And anger. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yes, he needed to kill someone today.</p><p>And if all of that wasn\u2019t enough to deal with, Legion looked at him the way he wanted Olivia to look at him. She\u2019d made a pact with the creator of evil, and she\u2019d blatantly lied to him about it. There at the end, just before leaving her behind, there\u2019d been no more deluding himself about that. Sly determination had practically poured off her.</p><p>What was he going to do about her? How was he supposed to handle her? He still loved her like a daughter, still planned to keep her in his life. No way would he abandon her. There just...there had to be a solution.</p> <p>Don\u2019t think about that now. You have a job to do. The job. Right. So. Back to Scarlet, the problem at hand. Did Galen know about her?</p><p>\u201cShe used to live in a church,\u201d Olivia said guiltily, before he could tell her they needed to leave. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t work out for her.\u201d</p><p>Why the guilt? Because she\u2019d led him here? Probably. Careful. He couldn\u2019t let her guilt spark his own. \u201cI believe I asked you to be quiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. She\u2019s not going to wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Silly question. Olivia knew everything, it sometimes seemed. Which meant Sabin was going to love her. Information was the man\u2019s best friend. Thank Olivia\u2019s One True Deity she would be gone before the warrior returned. Aeron would hate to have to stab his friend for interrogating his woman.</p> <p>At the thought, Wrath chortled with glee.</p><p>Well, maybe he wouldn\u2019t hate stabbing the warrior. He owed Sabin, after all. And she\u2019s not your woman! \u201cNever mind. It doesn\u2019t matter. We have to hurry before we run into other visitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Hunters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Aeron might have craved a battle with Nightmares, but not with Galen\u2019s army. He didn\u2019t want Olivia involved in something like that. He\u2019d show her the horrors of his life another way. From a safe distance.</p> <p>Scarlet\u2019s crypt was a good distance from The Asylum, so that was a point in their favor.</p><p>\u201c\u2014so dark,\u201d an unfamiliar voice suddenly said, the words echoing from the concrete steps above and reaching into the small enclosure.</p><p>\u201cMy flashlight\u2019s not working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust keep inching forward, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Well, hell. This day could indeed get worse. Hunters were here, just as he\u2019d feared. Had someone followed him? Used the Cloak of Invisibility?</p><p>Was someone watching him, threatening his woman, even now?</p><p>Aeron\u2019s hands curled into fists. He scanned the crypt anew, but saw nothing out of place. He glanced at Olivia, who was still glowing but frowning now. Next he glanced at Scarlet, who was still sleeping. After that, the doorway.</p> <p>That dark, open space was the only way out of here. And to reach it, they\u2019d have to run straight through the humans. The most likely armed humans.</p><p>Those humans couldn\u2019t see through the darkness, but then, Aeron wouldn\u2019t be able to, either, without Olivia\u2019s light. But with her light, everyone would be able to see everyone else.</p><p>There was only one thing to do. Only one option that kept Olivia safe.</p><p>Aeron slapped a blade into her hand. \u201cKeep it pressed to the girl\u2019s throat,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIf she moves even a little, don\u2019t hesitate to cut her.\u201d</p><p>Not giving her a chance to reply, he gripped Olivia by the waist and hefted her into the coffin beside Scarlet. The sleeping female remained exactly as she was, but Olivia gasped. Immediately he clamped a hand over her mouth and shook his head. She gulped in fear, but nodded that she understood what he wanted of her. Silence.</p><p>\u201cKill the light.\u201d</p><p>Again she nodded, and the glow of her skin washed out...dimmed...then disappeared completely. The shadows must have been waiting for just such an occurrence because they raced forward, enclosing every inch of space with that suffocating gloom.</p><p>\u201cShit! Watch where you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>The voices were closer.</p><p>Big as Aeron was, he knew he wouldn\u2019t fit inside the coffin to act as Olivia\u2019s shield. Not without crushing her. Instead, he flattened his hand on her shoulder\u2014or what he\u2019d thought was her shoulder. He jerked that now-burning hand away because he\u2019d actually cupped her beautiful breast. And her nipple had instantly pearled.</p><p>Mine. Protect.</p><p>Careful this time, he aimed higher. Shoulder. Good. Trembling. Not good. That meant she was as overcome\u2014and distracted\u2014by the mistake as he was. Or afraid. He preferred the thought of her overcome.</p><p>Clearly, he was the distracted one. Jolting back into motion, he pressed her to lie down and stay still. Thankfully, she didn\u2019t resist. Whether she did as he\u2019d commanded and placed the tip of the blade at Scarlet\u2019s throat, he didn\u2019t know. Just to be safe, he angled his other hand over Nightmares\u2019s...face. Good. She was still motionless, her breath trekking onto his skin, warm, even.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen any traps around the coffin itself, so he inched his way to the front end, away from the corridor\u2019s entryway. Not once did he remove his touch from either woman. He wanted Olivia to know he was here, that he would guard her. Always. He would have closed the lid, but wanted access in case the girl did, in fact, awaken.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d one of the men said. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAir. Do you feel the breeze?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must be close to an opening.\u201d</p><p>Closer still.</p><p>There was a shuffling of feet. Multiple sets. Olivia\u2019s trembling increased, and he squeezed her in reassurance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gotta be a room.\u201d A pause. A crackle. \u201cYes. Yes! There\u2019s too much space for this to be another hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t be here. She couldn\u2019t have found her way inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s possessed by the fucking demon of Nightmares. Of course she could have found her way. Just...feel around. She\u2019ll be asleep. If you encounter warm skin, just start shooting.\u201d</p><p>How did they know so much? Had Cronus told his wife? Or again, had someone made use of the Cloak and listened to private conversations?</p><p>\u201cHell, no. No shooting. We\u2019ll just shoot each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better than allowing a demon to go free.\u201d</p><p>There was a beat of shocked silence as the other Hunters absorbed the man\u2019s death wish.</p><p>\u201cWe either cut her, or I\u2019m out of here,\u201d someone finally snapped. \u201cI didn\u2019t sign up for a suicide mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen cut her, damn it, but make sure you incapacitate her so we can cart her out without fearing she\u2019ll be strong enough to attack. Every bad dream we\u2019ve ever had is her fault. Every bad thing we\u2019ve ever endured is her doing.\u201d</p><p>More shuffling. Aeron tensed, waiting. If any of them managed to make it to the coffin, he would have to\u2014</p><p>A man screamed.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2014\u201d</p><p>Another scream. A gurgle. Followed by another and another.</p><p>There would be no one making it to the coffin.</p><p>Nightmares\u2019s traps would see to that. Several of the Hunters discharged their guns, despite their fear of friendly fire, but the darkness hid the sparking of the powder. One of those bullets slammed into Aeron\u2019s shoulder, knocking him backward.</p><p>He caught himself as several more human screams rent the air. Though he didn\u2019t want Olivia trapped with the girl, unable to protect herself, he didn\u2019t want her shot, either. He slammed the coffin lid shut.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut,\u201d someone managed to say between coughs.</p><p>Another scream, this one blending with the rising tide of pained moans and the wafting scent of fresh blood.</p><p>\u201cRetreat,\u201d someone wheezed. \u201cRe\u2014 Argh!\u201d</p><p>There was even more shuffling, but the number of moving feet had severely decreased. And then, as more screams and moans abounded, the shuffling ended entirely. Over. Done. It was the battle he\u2019d wanted, craved, yet he hadn\u2019t had to lift a single finger to win.</p><p>He waited until silence reigned before tossing back the lid and saying, \u201cLight.\u201d</p><p>Immediately Olivia obeyed. Once again that nearly blinding light glimmered from her, grew, and conquered the darkness, and he saw that she was pale but unharmed. Scarlet still hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>\u201cAeron, I was so\u2014\u201d Olivia sat up and twisted to face him. Her expression immediately became pinched. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt.\u201d</p><p>He gazed down at his wound. There was a hole in his shoulder; crimson seeped from it, riding the ridges of his stomach, each drop absorbing into the waist of his pants. Now that his concern for Olivia had faded, and his adrenaline had decreased, he realized it hurt. Fire spread, quickly, surely, as if his veins pumped gasoline rather than blood.</p><p>Didn\u2019t matter. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBeen injured worse, so it\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d Chewing on her bottom lip, she reached out and traced her fingertips over his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m worried.\u201d</p><p>The touch was meant to comfort him. But as always, the feel of her tormented him. He needed more. Wrath needed more, whimpering inside his head.</p><p>Now isn\u2019t the time. Bleeding bodies were piled upon bleeding bodies, blades protruding from each of them. Some had fallen face-first, and others had landed backward. Each had died. He would have to thank the girl for her decorating skills. They, rather than he, had saved Olivia\u2019s life.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know if any of the Hunters had managed to escape this room of terror, but he wasn\u2019t going to wait around to see if they returned with backup. After helping Olivia to her feet\u2014shit! and causing his wound to split\u2014he hefted Nightmares into his arms as he\u2019d wanted to do before they were interrupted.</p><p>\u201cStay close,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly step where I step.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>He made his way to the open doorway, darting around bodies along the way, grimacing as the fire inside him intensified. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hurt, Wrath cried.</p><p>His lips curved into a frown. You, too?</p><p>Bad.</p><p>We\u2019ll go home. Rest. There were no trails of blood on the stairs, not even a speck. Which meant no one had made it out. Excellent. Except...by the time he reached the top of the stairs, he was trembling. Weakening. His eyes were glazing over, creating a fog everywhere he looked.</p> <p>Wrath moaned.</p><p>The fire finally died\u2014only to be replaced by a frigid ice.</p><p>\u201cAeron?\u201d</p><p>He slowed, his motions sluggish, his feet tripping over each other. \u201cReach into my back pocket. Grab my phone.\u201d At this rate, he wouldn\u2019t have the strength to fly both women to the fortress.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Olivia asked, doing as he\u2019d requested. \u201cIs it your injury? You told me not to worry!\u201d</p> <p>He ignored the question and the concern. He didn\u2019t want to lie to her\u2014again\u2014and tell her everything was going to be fine, but he didn\u2019t have an answer, either. Neither he nor Wrath had ever reacted this way to a simple gunshot.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to text?\u201d They rounded a corner.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve seen humans do it, but I\u2019ve never tried it myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about making a call?\u201d Up ahead, he could finally see the sunlight pushing its way into the crypt. Sweat beaded every inch of him, yet that did nothing to melt the ice. His motions were slowing further, dragging.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Damn. If he released the girl, he wouldn\u2019t be able to pick her back up. That, he knew. Damn, damn, damn.</p> <p>There were only two possibilities that explained this reaction, he realized. Either the Hunters had used some sort of special bullets or he hadn\u2019t truly recovered from their last attack, as he\u2019d assumed. Neither boded well for him.</p><p>Outside\u2014finally, blessedly\u2014he searched for waiting Hunters. He didn\u2019t see any, but wasn\u2019t sure if that was because they weren\u2019t there or because his vision continued to fade. No one jumped out at them, at least.</p><p>Flying or not, he wasn\u2019t going to make it home.</p><p>He searched his surroundings once more, this time looking for a place to hide. There, a few yards ahead, was a large headstone, flowers of every color perched all around it, forming a hidden alcove.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d He lumbered forward, weaker with every step.</p><p>Olivia wound her arm around his waist, acting as his crutch. \u201cHere. Lean on me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to, was embarrassed that he needed to, was even more embarrassed that he actually liked having someone take care of him, but with her aid, he managed to make it. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He tried to ease Scarlet down, but his knees gave out and the two of them just sort of tumbled forward. She flopped unceremoniously to the ground, and he next to her. Not a peep did she make.</p> <p>Nor did Wrath. The demon was silent now. Eerily so.</p><p>Aeron rolled to his side. Olivia, he saw, was busy rearranging the flowers to pin them in and shield them from prying eyes. \u201cGood...girl,\u201d he told her.</p><p>The smile she flicked him was all bravery and iron will. It caused his heart to skip a damned beat. And either he was seeing things that weren\u2019t there or butterflies were actually floating around her head. Squirrels sat at her feet, as well, and birds picked at the grass around her. All of them were watching her, as though waiting for her attention.</p><p>Surely he was hallucinating. Which meant he was even worse off than he\u2019d thought. Since he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to read the numbers on his phone, he told Olivia what to dial.</p><p>\u201cRinging,\u201d she said, and pressed the device to his ear.</p><p>\u201cTorin,\u201d he said after his friend answered. \u201cFollow signal. Come get...us.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hear the warrior\u2019s reply. A darkness very similar to what he\u2019d suffered inside that crypt closed around him, and this time, he could only welcome it.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>AFTER OLIVIA TORE a strip of cloth from the bottom of her robe and wrapped it around Aeron\u2019s shoulder, she withdrew one of the blades from the sheath anchored to his ankle. I will protect him. No matter the actions necessary. Just as he\u2019d done for her. She crouched in front of him, waiting for his friends to arrive. Or Hunters. If anyone besides a Lord approached, she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to attack.</p><p>Never had she felt more like a warrior, more confident in herself, yet more afraid\u2014for the man beside her. He\u2019d taken bullets before; she\u2019d seen him. He\u2019d been stabbed, beaten and cut with knives and arrows. Yet he hadn\u2019t reacted like this. He hadn\u2019t gone pallid, hadn\u2019t moaned and trembled. Hadn\u2019t continued to bleed and weaken.Minute after minute passed, and there was no change in him. Where in heaven\u2019s name were those Lords? They had better hurry, and not just for Aeron\u2019s sake. If they waited too long, dusk would arrive and Scarlet would awaken. And she would be very, very angry.</p><p>No one would survive.</p><p>At least that tempting voice had shut up the moment she\u2019d left the fortress, and stopped urging her to do those vile\u2014wonderful\u2014things. Hardly a silver lining, though. Nothing was. The animals were even now crowding through the flowers and bushes, perhaps drawing the attention of passersby. Trying to get closer to her? Or Aeron? She didn\u2019t remember them ever approaching Aeron before, but couldn\u2019t figure out why the squirrels, rabbits, birds, cats and even a dog would seek her.</p><p>\u201cScat,\u201d she whispered, not wanting them hurt if a fight did, in fact, break out.</p><p>They didn\u2019t budge. No, they inched closer. To her. So she was the draw. Why?</p><p>\u201cYou have to leave now\u2014\u201d</p><p>A twig snapped, quieting her.</p><p>The dog growled and the cats hissed, but none ran away. They crouched, ready to leap into attack.</p><p>Her lips pressed together, every muscle in her body freezing. She even stopped breathing. Who was here? Lords? Or Hunters? The hand holding the blade trembled. For Aeron, she thought, readying like the animals. She was suddenly glad they\u2019d stubbornly stayed with her.</p><p>Two men stepped past the foliage and at first, she didn\u2019t recognize them. She was too prepped, too determined to save this man she...loved? But just as she launched herself at one of them, the dog sprang forward, beating her to the target.</p><p>\u201cOw! Get off me, you mangy mutt,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>She recognized the voice\u2014William\u2014but didn\u2019t lower her blade in time, her momentum too swift. Just before contact, a hard hand wrapped around her wrist, jerking her to the side before stilling her.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, there, Liv,\u201d he said with a laugh. His voice was familiar, too. Paris. \u201cI can call you Liv, right? Drop the blade for me, yes?\u201d</p><p>Relief pounded through her, and she released the weapon.</p><p>\u201cNow tell this mutt to let go!\u201d William shouted.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re friends of mine,\u201d she told the dog. \u201cI\u2019m safe now.\u201d</p><p>The dog removed its teeth from William\u2019s ankle and each of the animals dashed away as if that was all they\u2019d been waiting for. The assurance of her safety.</p><p>What little darlings. \u201cThank you,\u201d she called gratefully.</p><p>\u201cNow that William\u2019s been properly welcomed,\u201d Paris said with another laugh, \u201cwe should get this show on the road.\u201d Concern lit his beautiful face when he spied Aeron. He bent down, slid his arms under the still-sleeping warrior and hefted him over his shoulder. \u201cHow long\u2019s he been like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo long.\u201d</p><p>William limped to Scarlet and did the same, only he cradled her in his arms as if she were a precious treasure. \u201cAt least I get the pretty package.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good luck with her,\u201d Paris replied. \u201cI\u2019d say I got the better end of this deal. Apparently she\u2019s possessed by Nightmares.\u201d</p><p>William rolled his eyes. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a bad thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like having your balls handed to you, then yeah, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to Daddy,\u201d William said, holding Scarlet all the tighter.</p><p>Olivia listened to their banter, head zinging back and forth between them. \u201cEnough. There were Hunters here, you know. This is a dangerous location. More than that, something\u2019s wrong with Aeron. I want him in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, sure,\u201d William told her with a nod. \u201cWe\u2019ve known that from the beginning. But you\u2019re going to have to wait until he wakes up for that kind of sport. When you finish with him, though, I\u2019d love a go at you myself. Show you what it\u2019s like to be with someone who knows what they\u2019re doing, and all that.\u201d</p><p>Her hands fisted. Did he take nothing seriously?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re parked over here.\u201d Paris jerked his head to the side.</p><p>Finally. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Together they broke through the bushes, and each man went on alert. In the span of a single second, it was as if they were different people. Hidden, they\u2019d joked with each other and teased her about wanting to bed Aeron. Now, they were soldiers, hardened, capable of anything.</p><p>So many times, she\u2019d watched the same change overcome Aeron. Until now, she hadn\u2019t truly appreciated it.</p><p>Aeron. Brave, injured Aeron. When her nine days ticked away and he was taken from her, where would she go? What would she do? She doubted these men would invite her to remain with them. And would she want them to? Aeron would no longer be there, the memory of him taunting her from every corner.</p><p>For the second time, Olivia found herself upset with the short amount of time she and Aeron had. Maybe there was a way to save him. Maybe there was a way for them to be together forever. Yes. Surely. Her Deity was the creator of love. Actually, her Deity was love. He would want two people who loved each other to be together. Right?</p><p>But she still wasn\u2019t sure beyond any doubt that she loved Aeron. Admired him, yes. Was aroused by him and craved his touch, oh, yes. But die in his place? she wondered again. Again, she wasn\u2019t sure. She\u2019d given up everything to be with him\u2014everything except her life.</p><p>Could she?</p><p>Plus, in dying for Aeron, she\u2019d have to die for Legion, as well. Because she knew, knew, Aeron wouldn\u2019t be happy without the little\u2014big now\u2014tyrant. And if Aeron was going to live, she wanted him to be happy while doing so. Yet the thought of dying for such a lying, conniving brat didn\u2019t settle well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>More than that, Aeron would have to love Olivia. Right now, there was no question that he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Olivia sighed as she climbed into the SUV. Aeron was laid across the backseat, and she cradled his head in her lap. Paris took the wheel and William flopped into the passenger seat with Scarlet still in his arms. Her first time in a car, something she\u2019d looked forward to, but now she didn\u2019t care. Her mind whirled.</p><p>Death wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d ever considered for herself. Not really. She\u2019d just always been and had known she would always be. Now she could die. Not to save someone, but just because, say, a car hit her. How did she feel about that? She didn\u2019t know. All she knew was that dying, without experiencing everything she wanted, was abhorrent. But afterward? Being without Aeron would be far more so.</p> <p>She\u2019d seen thousands, millions, of humans die. Not one of those deaths had ever affected her, for they had simply been part of the circle of life. Every beginning had an end. Perhaps that\u2019s why she hadn\u2019t mourned the thought of ultimately losing Aeron at first. It would be just another death in a long line of deaths she\u2019d witnessed.</p><p>Now, his was personal. She knew him intimately, had kissed and tasted him. Had experienced the ultimate pleasure with him. She had slept in his arms, curled into his side. He had protected her. He could have climbed inside that casket himself, but he hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d placed her inside, ensuring she walked away unscathed rather than himself.</p><p>Therefore, he\u2019d been willing to die for her. Why? Again, she had no illusions that he loved her.</p><p>She heaved another sigh and ran her palm along his scalp. As short as his hair was, the spikes tickled her skin. Later, she would summon Lysander. She would ask him about all of this\u2014and also why he\u2019d visited Aeron before. He wouldn\u2019t be able to lie to her. And if what he said was bad, destroying her hope for a future with this amazing man, she\u2019d...what? She gulped.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t leave Gilly in that apartment,\u201d William said suddenly, drawing Olivia from her thoughts. \u201cNot with your enemies buzzing around like flies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne, Aeron needs to get home. Two, she\u2019s better off there, disassociated from us.\u201d Paris fiddled with the rearview mirror, gaze darting in front of and behind him. \u201cThe Hunters have no idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>William slapped a hand on the console between them. \u201cI beg to differ, Sex. They knew about Scarlet, and what contact have we had with her? Almost none. How much have we had with Gilly? Too much. And with Rhea on Team Dumbness, we can\u2019t leave Gilly out there on her own. Besides, Aeron is immortal. He\u2019ll keep. So again, we can\u2019t leave her out there on her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. You\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pick her up on the way to the fortress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be at school,\u201d William said, and Paris cursed as he made an illegal turn, the tires squealing.</p> <p>Olivia thought about complaining. She wanted Aeron safe and doctored as soon as possible, but the men were right. Gilly was human and needed protecting.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Paris repeated. \u201cShe\u2019s at the American International School of Budapest, and it\u2019s located in the Nagykov\u00e1csi Campus. I think. Pretty good distance we\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorth it.\u201d</p><p>There was an odd tenderness in William\u2019s voice when he spoke about the girl. She was too young for him, though. Too young for any of the men at the fortress. If Olivia had to warn the warrior away, he wouldn\u2019t like her methods. They\u2019d involve a knife and a small plastic bag.</p><p>Embracing the warrior life you once so easily discarded?</p><p>\u201cI doubt that she\u2019ll be happy to see us,\u201d Paris said.</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself. Anya says she has a crush on me.\u201d William sounded proud about that.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just a child,\u201d Olivia reminded him. And I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m considered a warrior or not, I really will borrow one of Aeron\u2019s knives....</p> <p>William twisted in his seat to face her, hardly disturbing Scarlet at all. His lips were lifting in a naughty grin. \u201cI know that, but when it comes to my appeal, you\u2019ll find that age doesn\u2019t matter. Gender, either. I\u2019m irresistible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are your intentions toward her?\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cI have no intentions. I like to be admired, and she likes to admire me. That\u2019s the extent of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Olivia didn\u2019t hear a lie in his voice. Still. She wasn\u2019t taking any chances. Not with Gilly\u2019s well-being. \u201cShe\u2019s led a difficult life. Her mom\u2019s husband...did things to her.\u201d Perhaps she shouldn\u2019t be spilling Gilly\u2019s secrets, but she knew how the memories festered inside the girl. Finally bringing them into the light could be the first step to healing. \u201cShe told her mom, but the woman refused to believe her. Even accused her of trying to destroy her new, wonderful life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know about that,\u201d Paris said gently. \u201cDanika told us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d William swung back to face the front, but not before she caught a glimpse of utter, undiluted fury on his face. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was once assigned to her care.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the drive was made in tense, oppressive silence. Finally they were winding through a neighborhood, a suburb, the houses utterly wonderful and inviting. Thick green trees surrounded the area, one side situated on a hill and rising majestically.</p><p>The car stopped in a parking lot, and Paris flicked William a glance. \u201cI\u2019ll just be a minute. Watch the baggage.\u201d</p><p>Without warning, and moving so quickly there was nothing Paris could do, William dumped Scarlet in the demon\u2019s lap, no longer quite so careful. \u201cI\u2019ll just be a minute. You scare Gilly, and I\u2019m not having that. Not today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t scare women. I delight them. Besides, you aren\u2019t on the checkout list, and I am.\u201d</p><p>William rolled his eyes\u2014a favorite action of his, apparently\u2014and exited the vehicle. \u201cLike that\u2019ll stop me. Have you seen my eyes? They\u2019re electric. Women take one look and I\u2019m immediately placed on their checkout lists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop praising yourself and hurry,\u201d Olivia told him just as he slammed the door shut.</p><p>He saluted her with a grin.</p><p>She watched his progression into the school, fingers tracing over Aeron\u2019s warming brow. He wasn\u2019t getting any better, was even beginning to thrash a bit. His brow was beaded with sweat, and his teeth were digging into his bottom lip.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, she began to sing. Sweet songs of peace and health. A few chords into the hymn, Aeron stilled, his pinched expression even relaxing somewhat.</p><p>\u201cMy gods,\u201d Paris whispered brokenly.</p><p>Her voice tapered off, and she looked up at him. \u201cWhat? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Aeron began thrashing again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop!\u201d Paris said. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful. My ears are already addicted and need more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Thank you.\u201d Olivia launched into another serenade. Outside, she could see all manner of animals emerging from the forest and approaching the vehicle. Once more, Aeron calmed and she could have wept with joy.</p><p>Would she die for him? Her finger traced one of the skeletal tattoos on his cheekbone. Maybe.</p><p>WILLIAM STOOD in the school\u2019s main office, waiting for Gilly. The receptionist had already called her. As he\u2019d told the female that his name was Paris Lord, she\u2019d summoned the girl without incident. List crisis averted.</p><p>She was short and curved, in her mid-thirties with a sleek brown bob and brown eyes\u2014eyes she was now in the process of stripping him with. A routine occurrence. One he usually enjoyed. Not so now. He just wanted to haul Gilly the hell out of here. He liked the little smart-ass, and wouldn\u2019t rest until she was safe.He\u2019d had no idea she\u2019d led so terrible a life, and he was ashamed of himself. He knew women. He could figure them out in the span of a once-over. So why hadn\u2019t he realized Gilly was hurting?</p><p>Her fucking mother and would-be stepfather! Two people who were supposed to protect her. Well, William was with her now and William would ensure nothing like that ever happened again. He was tempted to cut her mother and stepdad\u2019s throats. Maybe give her their heads for Christmas or something.</p><p>\u201cAre you Gilly\u2019s father?\u201d the receptionist asked. She\u2019d abandoned her post at her desk and now stood across from him at the counter.</p><p>Shit. He hadn\u2019t seen or heard her move. That level of distraction was dangerous. \u201cBrother,\u201d he replied, a bit irritated that he looked old enough to have a seventeen-year-old daughter. Yeah, he was pushing two thou, but he didn\u2019t have a wrinkle on him, damn it!</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s nice.\u201d She grinned and slid a piece of paper his way. \u201cIf you\u2019d ever like to discuss her curriculum, here\u2019s my number. Call anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely be in contact.\u201d He, too, grinned, though his was forced. He pocketed the paper, knowing he wouldn\u2019t use it. \u201cEducation is so important.\u201d</p><p>That earned him a giggle, and he tried not to cringe.</p><p>Women. They were both a blessing and a curse. Sex, he loved. Sex, he needed, craved. Sex with the wrong woman had gotten him locked up. Sex with the goddesses who visited him in prison had gotten him kicked out of the heavens. That hadn\u2019t stopped his libido, however. Actually, nothing stopped his libido. Even the curse hanging over his head.</p><p>One day, a woman of great beauty and power would tempt him. One day, that woman would trick him into loving her. One day, that woman would enslave him. And then, that woman would kill him.</p><p>It had already been prophesied.</p><p>Maybe\u2014perhaps\u2014okay, not really likely\u2014he could have avoided females altogether and saved himself the trouble of such a death sentence. But even that wouldn\u2019t have saved him. That, too, was part of the prophesy. To avoid women and sex was simply to condemn himself to a much faster, much more painful death.</p><p>The only way to stop the unnamed woman and break the curse had been written in a book. A book that was nearly impossible to decode, so he had yet to find the answer. Also, the minor fucking goddess of Anarchy had possession of that book, returning it page by stingy page. He\u2019d hate Anya for such a thing if he didn\u2019t love her so damned much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They\u2019d spent hundreds of years in Tartarus as cell neighbors. Her wit had been the only thing to keep him sane.</p><p>\u201cWilliam?\u201d Gilly\u2019s husky voice suddenly rang out.</p><p>He turned on his heel and there she was, standing at the end of a long hallway. She was slender, dark haired, dark eyed, and more...knowledgeable than someone her age should ever be. That should have been clue number one, he thought.</p> <p>Maybe he\u2019d sensed it, but hadn\u2019t wanted to acknowledge it.</p><p>She wore jeans and a T-shirt, and sneakers that had a tracking device hidden in the soles, not that she knew it. Her hair was pulled back in a ponytail, not a speck of makeup on her face.</p><p>That didn\u2019t seem to bother the boy next to her. He was staring at her as if hypnotized. But having heard her say William\u2019s name, that boy had frowned. And when he followed the line of her gaze and spotted William, his frown deepened and he paled.</p><p>Boyfriend? Or potential boyfriend?</p><p>Someone would have to put a stop to that. She was too young, with too traumatic a past. She needed to be alone. Until she was at least forty.</p> <p>\u201cHey, pet,\u201d William said with a finger wave.</p><p>Grinning, she rushed forward and threw herself into his arms. He hugged her tight before latching onto her wrists and gently pushing her back. He might enjoy her, might want the best for her, but he didn\u2019t want to encourage her crush anymore.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The boy she\u2019d been with eased up behind her. He was tall for a teen, reaching William\u2019s ear, with brown hair and blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d William demanded unceremoniously.</p><p>\u201cC-Corbin, sir.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of a name is Corbin Sir? And if you ever hurt Gilly, I swear to the gods I will personally\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gilly slapped William\u2019s shoulder. \u201cStop. Cori\u2019s my friend. He just wanted to make sure I reached the office okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s admirable,\u201d William said, never removing his narrowed gaze from the boy. \u201cAs long as protection was his only goal.\u201d</p><p>Corbin pulled at the collar of his shirt. \u201cAre you her...boyfriend or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrother,\u201d William said as Gilly said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His gaze finally whipped back to her, and he arched a brow. Yes? They needed to have a chat, then. Maybe later, though. Hearing the word had caused something to tighten in his chest. He\u2019d figure out what that tightening meant first.</p><p>\u201cSo why are you here?\u201d she asked again, her cheeks reddening.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like that he\u2019d embarrassed her, but there was no help for it. \u201cAeron\u2019s been hurt. There are problems in the city, and we want you in the fortress with the others until it\u2019s safe again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAeron?\u201d Corbin asked.</p><p>\u201cAnother brother,\u201d William informed him.</p><p>The boy\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cHow many do you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot,\u201d Gilly replied with a weary sigh. \u201cSo you\u2019ll be there, Liam? At the fortress?\u201d</p><p>Liam. Her nickname for him. Once he\u2019d liked it. Now he saw it as the endearment it was meant to be. Oh, yes. They\u2019d be having a chat. Damn his irresistible beauty. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll be there. So let\u2019s go home, pet. Aeron\u2019s in the car and he needs some medical attention stat.\u201d</p><p>Despite her fear of the Lords, she paled with worry, grabbed his hand and led him from the building. \u201cBye, Cori,\u201d she called over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cBye,\u201d the boy returned, and there was a bit of an edge to the sound.</p><p>William spied the Escalade but couldn\u2019t see Olivia through the window tint, not to mention the god-awful number of deer now surrounding the vehicle. However, he didn\u2019t have to see her to know that if they failed to get Aeron to the fortress safely, the angel, for all her goodness, would erupt into a seething cauldron of feminine fury. It was there in her eyes, a churning, unstoppable passion just waiting to boil over. Something she probably didn\u2019t realize she was capable of, but William realized it because, unlike his cluelessness with Gilly, he\u2019d picked up on Olivia\u2019s dreams, fears and needs the moment he\u2019d seen her.</p><p>Aeron was her everything. If the warrior died, even the gods wouldn\u2019t be able to stop her rampage.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>OLIVIA SAT AT THE EDGE of Aeron\u2019s bed, hip pressed to hip. Legion sat on his other side, hip pressed to hip. In their concern for him, they\u2019d worked together to strip him. Olivia hadn\u2019t allowed herself to look at his penis, no matter how often the voice had told her to do so.</p><p>Oh, yes. The voice of temptation had returned.Weak as Aeron was, any peeking on her part would have been wrong. He was so weak, in fact, that he hadn\u2019t stirred once. He\u2019d even stopped moaning, though she wasn\u2019t singing, and she didn\u2019t think that was a good sign.</p><p>His wound was still seeping, and even though the piece of her robe wrapped around his shoulder was self-cleaning, it couldn\u2019t keep up with the flow and was soaked through. His tattooed skin was clammy, no longer hot with sweat. To warm him up, they\u2019d placed blankets all around him, but it hadn\u2019t affected his plummeting temperature.</p><p>As a last resort, they\u2019d sat beside him, hoping their body heat would be the magic cure.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d Legion demanded, hands rough as they petted him.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Olivia replied, though she couldn\u2019t keep the guilt out of her tone. She should have done more for him. \u201cHe was shot by Hunters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t protect him.\u201d</p><p>Slap her.</p><p>Ignoring the voice no longer proved difficult, her concern for Aeron overshadowing everything else. \u201cWhat could I have done?\u201d The question brought a fresh wave of torment.</p><p>\u201cYou could have taken the bullet for him. I would have.\u201d</p><p>Yes, Legion probably would have. I\u2019m a failure as a girlfriend. Not that she was his girlfriend. But she wanted to be, therefore she should have acted like one. \u201cEven if he survives this\u2014\u201d which he would, she would accept no less \u201c\u2014he\u2019s going to die in a few days because of you.\u201d Oh, Deity. Sorrow joined the torment.</p><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d Though the word was snarled, Legion leaned down and gently kissed Aeron\u2019s brow. \u201cDo you hear this, darling? Your angel is a liar. You will never die. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>Shove her away and claim your man.</p><p>Again she easily ignored the voice and the darkness that came with it. \u201cIn nine days, an angel assassin will come for him. That assassin will take his head. Because of you. Because you wouldn\u2019t stay in hell where you belonged.\u201d Rage now.</p><p>Legion straightened, twisted toward her, teeth bared in a glower. Once more, her eyes were glowing that demon red. \u201cAnother word and I\u2019ll stab you while you\u2019re sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I\u2019m sleeping next to Aeron?\u201d The taunt was all her own, and she couldn\u2019t regret that she\u2019d said it.</p><p>\u201cYou bitch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh. Catfight,\u201d an amused voice said from the doorway.</p><p>William.</p><p>If only it had been William to fascinate her, she thought then. He would have seduced her that very first day, and because his attention span lasted only a few days, she easily could have given him up at the end of her two-week trial.</p><p>Then again, she probably would have taken his head if ordered, so she wouldn\u2019t have sacrificed her future for a little time with him in the first place. Where Aeron was selfless, William was selfish, a trait that would have been irritating in anyone else. William wore it well, that was for sure.</p><p>He had one shoulder pressed into the door\u2019s frame, arms crossed over his chest. \u201cSorry we tried to stab you when we got home,\u201d he said to Legion. He and Paris had been completely taken aback when they\u2019d spied the strange female flying down the steps and shouting Aeron\u2019s name.</p><p>They\u2019d tackled her to the ground. Only Olivia\u2019s explanation about who she was\u2014and how she\u2019d gotten that way\u2014had stayed their hands from delivering a deathblow.</p><p>Should have stayed quiet, she thought. Not that it would have done any good. Torin, who had eyes and ears all over the fortress, it seemed, had quickly confirmed her story.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame us, though,\u201d William continued smoothly. \u201cThe change is mind-blowing. Besides, I figured we\u2019d reached our limit on pretty females long ago and couldn\u2019t possibly be lucky enough to score another.\u201d</p><p>Ugh. Flirting. Did William never stop? The only time she hadn\u2019t heard him flirt was on the drive back to the fortress. Gilly had tried to gain his attention, but he\u2019d been strangely silent.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like you would provide a real fight for me,\u201d the demon girl grumbled, probably charmed despite herself. Weren\u2019t they all?</p><p>\u201cYou wound my honor.\u201d He clutched his chest. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to fight again later and see who actually comes out on top. I prefer my battles naked. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you were going to talk to the others,\u201d Olivia interjected, moving them along. \u201cDoes anyone have any idea what could be wrong with Aeron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually why I\u2019m here,\u201d William said, accepting the change of topic without protest. \u201cTorin thinks he\u2019s been poisoned.\u201d</p><p>Poison. That made sense. And considering the people in high places the Hunters knew, she would bet that poison was heaven-sent. Human poison, like human alcohol, wouldn\u2019t have affected him this severely. \u201cDoes Torin have a remedy?\u201d she asked hopefully.</p><p>William gave a grave shake of his head. \u201cHe\u2019s got the women searching through old scrolls Reyes has, so I\u2019d give them another few hours before you start panicking.\u201d</p><p>Hours? Did Aeron have that long? She gulped, tears burning her eyes. Perhaps it was time to change the subject again. If she broke down, she\u2019d be no help to anyone.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Scarlet?\u201d she asked shakily.</p><p>\u201cLocked up and still sleeping. Cute little thing,\u201d he added as an afterthought. \u201cI might have a go at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I think she\u2019s ugly,\u201d Legion huffed. \u201cJust like the angel.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFallen.\u201d Olivia didn\u2019t spare her a glance, instead remaining focused on William. \u201cThat cute little thing can kill everyone here. Tell the Lords and the women to stay awake if at all possible. The moment they go to sleep, Scarlet can invade their dreams even when she\u2019s asleep herself. They\u2019ll think what\u2019s happening in those dreams is real, and their bodies will react accordingly, making any injury they sustain in the dream a reality.\u201d</p><p>Wait. Aeron...asleep...nightmares... Had Scarlet already attacked Aeron? Olivia had to stifle a cry at the thought. She had to wake him. Soon.</p><p>William pursed his lips. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have told us that little gem before we brought her here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould it have mattered?\u201d Saved Aeron? I\u2019m an even worse girlfriend than I\u2019d realized.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>The truth, or was he trying to absolve her of culpability?</p><p>\u201cOh, and speaking of nightmares,\u201d he added, \u201cthere are animals all around the fortress, just like there were around the car at Gilly\u2019s school and in the cemetery. Want to explain that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could,\u201d Olivia replied, suddenly grateful to him and eager to help him any way she could. \u201cEver since I left that crypt, they\u2019ve been seeking me out and I don\u2019t know why.\u201d Last thing she\u2019d done was summon her inner light and\u2014</p> <p>And there was the answer. Her inner light. Of course. They\u2019d sensed that light, and now sought the source. She explained to William.</p><p>\u201cCool trick, but it\u2019s really freaking everyone out. And by everyone I mean everyone. Lucien flashed the rest of the men here. You know, the ones who were in Rome. And here\u2019s a little tidbit of gossip.\u201d Grinning, he rubbed his hands together. \u201cFlashing makes Reyes ill and while vomiting, he had to fight off birds and rodents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you are.\u201d Legion shot her a scowl. \u201cYou\u2019re a troublemaker. Nothing goes right when you\u2019re around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up!\u201d Olivia snapped. \u201cWe should be thinking of ways to help Aeron. Or, at the very least, finding him a doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need a doctor. He just needs me. And I\u2019m going to be there for him.\u201d Legion began peeling off the dress she\u2019d found while Olivia and Aeron had been fighting for their lives. A barely there dress clearly meant to rival Olivia\u2019s slut-it-up outfit.</p> <p>Olivia gaped at her. \u201cYou plan to be there for him by ravishing him while he sleeps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Naked, completely unabashed, Legion pinched the covers around Aeron and pulled them back, clearly meaning to do as she\u2019d claimed.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s gonna have to wait. Legion, honey, I need you to come with me,\u201d William said with a crook of his finger.</p><p>Frowning, she paused, and her huge breasts jiggled. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, as if he hadn\u2019t thought that far ahead.</p><p>\u201cYes, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, I need to introduce you to the warriors who\u2019ve been out of town. That way, they won\u2019t try to attack you when they come to check on Aeron. And they will. Check on him and attack you, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He was making it up as he went along, Olivia suspected, trying to give her some alone time with Aeron. She could have hugged him.</p> <p>\u201cBut I can\u2019t leave him,\u201d Legion whined.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll only be a moment.\u201d He smiled a beautifully practiced smile. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Legion grumbled, jerking the dress over her head and smoothing the white material down her dangerously curved hips. She hissed at Olivia. \u201cIf you touch him, I\u2019ll eat your eyes in front of you and you\u2019ll have to watch, unable to stop me!\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t point out the flaw in her plan as the two left the bedroom and shut the door behind them, William winking over his shoulder. Not knowing how long this reprieve would last, she didn\u2019t waste any time stretching out beside Aeron herself.</p><p>Kiss him...</p><p>When things settled down, she was going to figure out who was invading her head and why.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t kiss him, but she would pray.</p><p>As she caressed her hand down Aeron\u2019s chest, she closed her eyes. \u201cDear Heavenly Deity. I come to You now, as a humble servant who loves You. This man, he isn\u2019t evil, despite the evil inside him. He\u2019s kind. He\u2019s considerate. He\u2019s capable of great affection and boundless loyalty. Those are the very things You value most. He\u2019s to die, I know. But not now. Not like this. You, who can work all things, even the worst of things, to our good, can heal him, making him ever stronger. You, who long ago conquered death, can save him.\u201d</p><p>Please hear me. Please help me.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing this to yourself, Olivia? He\u2019s going to die eventually, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Lysander. That was even faster than she\u2019d hoped. Thank you, thank you, a thousand times thank you!</p><p>The voice\u2014Temptation, she was going to call him\u2014screeched in frustration. Not him. Anyone but him. I can\u2019t stand that bastard.</p><p>\u201cThen leave,\u201d she snapped, a suspicion blooming. Temptation clearly hated her mentor, an angel, and the only beings to hate angels were demons.</p><p>That meant Temptation was a demon.</p><p>I will. So for now, later, baby.</p><p>When this demon returned, and he would, she had no doubt, she would have to be better guarded.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d Lysander said.</p><p>She opened her eyes a crack. Sure enough, her mentor stood off to the side. Tall, imposing, pulsing with power. His golden wings arched over his shoulders, and his robe swayed at his ankles.</p><p>What had he first asked? Oh, yes. Why are you doing this to yourself? \u201cAeron doesn\u2019t deserve to die like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany do not deserve the deaths that come for them.\u201d</p><p>She curled into Aeron\u2019s side, acting as his shield, as a proper girlfriend should do. \u201cYou were given a second chance with your Harpy. I deserve a second chance with Aeron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when his time is up, will you request a third?\u201d</p><p>To answer as he wished was to lie. \u201cWhy are you here, Lysander?\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked in his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you that your prayer was heard. I\u2019m here to tell you that Aeron will be healed, but that you must make a sacrifice in return, as is our way.\u201d</p><p>Sacrifice. Yes, that was usually the way of things. Since the beginning of time, self-sacrifice, undiluted proof of love, had always held the power to sway her Deity\u2014and change the world. \u201cI accept. Therefore, you may do what you were sent to do and leave.\u201d</p><p>He remained unmoving. \u201cDo you not care to know what you will be losing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Well, no matter. I will tell you, anyway. You will lose your Voice of Truth. No longer will others believe everything you say. No longer will you never face doubt. No longer will you recognize a lie the moment it\u2019s spoken. And if you decide to return to the heavens and be the angel you were meant to be, you still won\u2019t have your Voice of Truth. It will be gone from you forever.\u201d</p><p>Automatically, her hand sought her throat. Lose her truth? She would rather lose her hands as Gideon had. How would she deal with Aeron doubting her, when she would know in her soul that what she spoke was true?</p><p>Her gaze flicked to him. So still, so pale. So gaunt.</p><p>\u201cThink carefully,\u201d Lysander said. \u201cEvery hour, every minute, the path you are on develops more dangerous curves. And do you know what I see at the end of that road, no matter the direction you take? Do you know what awaits you there? Death, Olivia. Your death. And for what? A few more days with him. A few more days with a man who made a deal with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI vowed that if he can convince you to return to the heavens, I will try and convince the Council to spare his life as well as his demon companion\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth floundered open and closed. In shock, yes, that Lysander was now willing to fight the Council when he\u2019d always denied her pleas to do so, but mostly in hurt. This explained so much. Lysander\u2019s secret visit with Aeron. Why Aeron hadn\u2019t given her that last orgasm. Why he\u2019d wanted her to see him fight, showing her the harshness of his life.</p><p>She meant nothing to him. Not really. How could she, if he were so eager to use her as a bargaining chip? And yet, he was still a man she admired. He was willing to do anything to save someone he loved. To save Legion.</p><p>If only that loved one could have been her.</p><p>\u201cIf I return with you, you can guarantee he will live?\u201d she croaked.</p><p>\u201cI can try.\u201d Which didn\u2019t sound like a guarantee to her. \u201cWhat\u2019s important here is that he agreed,\u201d Lysander added before she could reply. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to part with you to save himself.\u201d</p><p>The hurt expanded, consuming her, choking her.</p><p>\u201cDoes that change your mind about this healing?\u201d Lysander asked quietly. Hopefully. \u201cThis sacrifice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she answered without hesitation. Aeron had placed Legion\u2019s well-being above hers, yes, but she\u2019d expected that. What she hadn\u2019t expected was to lose him before their time was up. Despite everything, she couldn\u2019t lose him. \u201cI still wish to make this bargain.\u201d</p><p>Sadness filled Lysander\u2019s eyes. \u201cThen so it shall be done.\u201d</p><p>As the last word left him, her vocal cords seized. For a moment, she couldn\u2019t speak at all. Couldn\u2019t even gurgle or gasp or breathe. She clawed at her throat, her mind fogging as ice and fire melded in her blood.</p><p>\u201cIt will pass,\u201d Lysander said, suddenly in front of her and stroking her temple. It was what he\u2019d done anytime she\u2019d failed to bring her human charges joy. Offered comfort. He had always wanted the best for her, and clearly did now, as well. He was not a bad man, and she would do well to remember that.</p><p>As he\u2019d promised, oxygen finally began to seep past her throat and into her lungs. The fire dulled, the ice melted. The fog dissipated. Grateful, she sucked in breath after breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould Aeron have done the same for you?\u201d Lysander asked. \u201cNo. Do not answer. Just think about all I have said.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She would be able to do nothing else.</p><p>\u201cBe prepared, sweet Olivia. Aeron could very well be injured like this again. I fear Rhea has given the Hunters water from the five rivers of the Realm of Hades.\u201d</p> <p>Olivia flinched. Such water used as a weapon meant certain death. A sip, a touch, and goodbye forever. Even the soul withered. The only way to combat the vile poison was to drink from the River of Life. A river even she didn\u2019t know how to find.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been making their own bullets and each of those bullets contains a single drop of that water.\u201d He withdrew a small vial from his robe. \u201cAeron needs only a drop of this to heal. The rest I would hide. Just in case. Use it carefully, however, for when it\u2019s gone, you\u2019ll receive no more.\u201d</p><p>River of Life? Hand trembling, she claimed the vial.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t think, even for a moment, that this will save him after his head is taken. And it will be taken, Olivia. An assassin will come.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze fell. Lysander knew her well; she had been thinking along those lines. No matter. She shook her head, tossing away her disappointment and renewing her determination. She would simply find another way.</p> <p>\u201cI thought you meant to petition the Council for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so I shall. We know the results such a petition will wield. He does not. They were lenient with you, but then, you are one of us. He is a demon. There will be no leniency.\u201d</p><p>Would telling him do any good?</p><p>\u201cHow you worry me, Olivia.\u201d Lysander sighed. \u201cI will leave you to your task.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>GIDEON, KEEPER OF LIES, tossed and turned atop his bed. His boxers were glued to his sweat-soaked skin, his bandaged hands\u2014or lack thereof\u2014throbbing painfully. Blood had beaded on those bandages and as much as he\u2019d healed, that hadn\u2019t happened in weeks. Regression?</p> <p>He was asleep but still aware, which was weird as shit, and trapped in the thickest darkness he\u2019d ever come across. Again weird, if not technically true. Not for his demon, at any rate. The darkness inside Pandora\u2019s box had been just like this, suffocating and maddening. Something Lies hadn\u2019t stopped screaming about since entering the strange realm\u2014screams that blended with the ones layering the darkness. Thousands and thousands of discordant shrieks, each one more tortured than the last.Clawing his way out proved impossible.</p><p>\u201cGideon. Gideon, man, wake up. You\u2019re not supposed to sleep.\u201d</p><p>He heard Paris\u2019s voice, wanted to obey, but again, he couldn\u2019t. The darkness was too cloying, wrapping around him, holding tightly, nearly drowning him. And then he did drown, losing that thread of consciousness altogether. Can\u2019t breathe...</p><p>The gloom parted, and he sucked in a greedy breath\u2014only to scramble backward. Oh, hell, no. Spider!</p><p>Don\u2019t calm, his demon told him.</p><p>You don\u2019t calm! Panting, trying not to screech like a pussy, he flattened himself against the wall. The monstrous spider followed, those eight hundred legs stabbing into the ground, those beady eyes practically peering into his soul.</p><p>Enemy, Lies said. Meaning, friend.</p><p>Hardly. Shit, shit, shit. Every brain cell he possessed\u2014all of which were trapped in that shit-haze of panic\u2014suddenly let him know, in high-def detail, that he would be this creature\u2019s dinner. He\u2019d rather be set on fire. He\u2019d rather be hanged. Hell, he\u2019d rather be gutted.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be so tasty,\u201d he said desperately. Truth was, he\u2019d taste like shit, but then, even in his dreams, he couldn\u2019t say what he meant. At least, he didn\u2019t think so. He\u2019d never tried it. And wouldn\u2019t. The consequences could be just as devastating as when he did so in real life. Pain, pain and more pain.</p><p>Memories of his last tangle with truth were fresh in his mind. A few weeks ago, he\u2019d told a Hunter what he really felt\u2014hate\u2014and what he really wanted to do\u2014hurt, maim, kill. All because he, who could spot a lie from a few thousand miles away, had been tricked into believing Sabin, keeper of Doubt, was dead, slain by Hunter hands. Stupid of him. But as the pain racked him, he\u2019d thought what\u2019s a little more and had volunteered himself for torture to save his friends from having to endure it.</p><p>That\u2019s when he lost his hands to a hacksaw. They were now stubs with a few fingers. Even in his dreams. Therefore, he couldn\u2019t defend himself properly against Mr. Hungry\u2014who was still eyeing him as if he were a slab of beef as he tripped from one corner of the dream room to another.</p><p>Those corners closed in on him, the space shrinking.</p><p>Hell. No. \u201cCome closer!\u201d Stay away! \u201cYou want to do this.\u201d You don\u2019t want to do this.</p><p>Don\u2019t calm, Lies repeated.</p><p>There was no time to analyze his demon\u2019s odd behavior. One of those hairy legs swiped out. The tip was sharp, bladelike, and sliced his thigh. Maybe that tip had been dipped in poison, because the sting that next exploded through him sent him to his knees, causing his muscles to lock onto his bones, nearly breaking them in half.</p><p>\u201cDo that again,\u201d he rasped. Shut up, just shut up! He rarely despised his demon. Most days, he even liked the bastard. Was glad to be a stronger, harder soldier because of the little fiend. But not now. He wanted to curse that damned spider to everlasting hell.</p><p>Why he was so afraid of spiders, he didn\u2019t know. The fear had simply always been there.</p><p>Another swipe of that leg. Another cut, this one on his back as he tried to spin away from impact. The sting spread quickly, his muscles twisting. The bones in his arm did break this time.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d he repeated, the word like an arrow as it left his clenched teeth. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t calm!</p><p>The spider stilled, its disgusting head tilting to the side. Watching him, studying him. Damn it! He couldn\u2019t scramble away, was now locked in place.</p><p>\u201cStay!\u201d Go! The thickness of his breath, beating against the too-close walls, echoed.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say the opposite of what your expression tells me you mean?\u201d</p><p>The voice came out of nowhere. Or maybe the spider was talking. Except he would have thought a spider that ugly would be male, and this voice had been pure femininity. Familiar somehow. Soft, yet strong. Relax, that voice said.</p><p>Lies sighed with contentment.</p><p>\u201cStay!\u201d Gideon shouted to the beast. He wouldn\u2019t be tricked into passivity like his demon.</p><p>Slowly, too slowly, the spider faded, shimmering out of view. Another trick. You have to\u2014</p><p>A woman stepped from the ensuing murkiness. She was tall and lean, with shoulder-length black hair that possessed not a single curl or hint of wave. There was something as familiar about her face as there\u2019d been about her voice.</p><p>Who was she?</p><p>She had eyes like black velvet, a regal nose and lips so red they were like thousands of tiny, freshly polished rubies that had been pressed together and cut into a heart. Her cheekbones were sharp, her chin stubborn, but by the gods, she was lovely. A warrior queen.</p><p>His heart continued its frantic beat, even as Lies uttered another of those sighs. The panic left him, leaving behind a white-hot fascination. A trick? Who cared! His mind had surely used his deepest fantasies to create her.</p><p>The sweat dried on his body, and the ice left his blood as a consuming fire washed through him, blistering everything it touched. So badly he wanted to reach out, to touch her, to caress her face and run his fingers through her hair. To know if she was as soft and silky as he thought she would be.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say the opposite of what you mean?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d he said, meaning that he did, in fact, know the answer. He could have lied in more detail, allowing her to decipher the truth, but a single thought had stopped him. What if she was Bait, a female sent to help destroy him?</p><p>Were Hunters now so powerful they could invade dreams?</p><p>Possible. Torin had visited him earlier and told him that Galen had an artifact, that the traitor had successfully bonded the demon of Distrust with a dark-haired female and\u2014 A dark-haired female?</p><p>He stiffened. Like the one he was staring at?</p><p>\u201cCome to the dungeon,\u201d she said. \u201cAlone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho aren\u2019t you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cWho aren\u2019t you?\u201d she shot back.</p><p>Silence slithered between them, and anger filled those black eyes. Anger and still that churning curiosity.</p><p>\u201cCome to the dungeon, or I\u2019ll bring back the spider.\u201d With that, she disappeared.</p><p>Gideon\u2019s eyelids flew open, his conscious mind propelled from that dream-state as if riding a rocket.</p><p>\u201cThank the gods,\u201d a frantic Paris said. \u201cFinally.\u201d</p><p>Gideon was panting. Unlike in his dream, his sweat was not dried. It poured off him, drenching him. Just like in his dream, however, his arm, thigh and back were throbbing, bleeding from where they\u2019d been cut.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he demanded shakily. \u201cSmall, hairless mosquito...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad dream, as I feared.\u201d</p><p>Fading sunlight trickled in through the only window in his room, but his overhead light was on, illuminating his friend. Paris\u2019s hair was multihued, and each of those hues gleamed brightly. His skin was pale, yet it held the shimmer of a pearl.</p><p>Now, Gideon might have acted like a pussy, but Paris looked like one, he thought with the first threads of humor returning.</p><p>\u201cYou fell asleep before we could tell you not to and must\u2019ve met our new guest.\u201d</p><p>The girl. \u201cWho isn\u2019t our guest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScarlet\u2019s her name, and she\u2019s a Lord of the Underworld. Or Lordess, I guess.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d actually found one of the missing links and brought her here? \u201cWhat\u2019s she not a keeper of?\u201d He would have scrubbed a hand down his face to clear away the remnants of sleep, but couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Paris sensed his need and wiped his eyes with the edge of his sleeve. \u201cNightmares, apparently. Pretty thing, if you like \u2019em rough, but evidently she\u2019s as crazy as the Hunters.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nightmares. For some reason, the word alone was nearly enough to give his own demon an orgasm. And Gideon, well, he was suddenly wondering why the girl had seemed so familiar to him.</p><p>Stay, stay, stay, Lies demanded inside his mind.</p><p>\u201cOlivia helped us capture her, and she\u2019s locked in the dungeon,\u201d Paris continued.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s hurt, right?\u201d he demanded, throwing his weakened legs over the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, man?\u201d</p><p>Gideon managed to stand, swaying but thankfully not falling, his gaze sweeping over his body. He still wore those boxers, was dirty from the sweat and probably smelled.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t vanity that propelled him unsteadily toward the bathroom, he told himself, but a sense of politeness. No reason to torture the girl\u2014Scarlet, Paris claimed\u2014when she had yet to do anything wrong. Well, kind of. His newest wounds hurt, dripping blood all over his clean floor. Her fault?</p><p>Aeron, housecleaner extraordinaire, would be pissed, a prospect that had his lips twitching. If nothing else, that\u2019d be fun to watch. Aeron with a mop. Classic.</p> <p>All the Lords had assigned chores. A great thing for his friends, sure, but Gideon kind of excelled at freeloading. A title he\u2019d once worn with pride. Then Paris had guilted him into helping with the shopping. They\u2019d taken turns, each going to the grocery once a week, Paris at the beginning of the week and Gideon at the end.</p><p>He wondered if someone else had taken over the chore since his injury and if so, what he\u2019d have to do instead once he recovered fully. Probably help Aeron with maid-service.</p><p>His lips stopped twitching.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d she do to you?\u201d Paris asked, sidling up to him and acting as his crutch the rest of the way to the bathroom. Once there, Paris even started the water. Scalding hot, just as Gideon liked it. \u201cYou mentioned a small, hairless mosquito and I gotta tell you, I have no idea what that means.\u201d</p><p>With a little more help, Gideon managed to strip. He stepped under the spray. He\u2019d never been modest and he knew Paris, who\u2019d been with thousands and thousands of women, and even the occasional man over the years, wouldn\u2019t care.</p><p>For a long while, he simply stood immobile, stubs braced on the wall in front of him, broken arm throbbing as the water poured over him, burning his face and body. Then his good wrist was captured, his bandage upturned and a bar of soap placed atop it.</p> <p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d he muttered. How was he going to manage this?</p><p>\u201cIt lives,\u201d Paris muttered back. \u201cYou never answered my question. What\u2019d she do to you with those mosquitoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said, meaning something.</p><p>\u201cI know that. Start talking.\u201d</p><p>As he scrubbed himself with the soap as best he could, considering he was handless and reduced to using only his right arm, he explained in Gideon-speak. His meaning was clear\u2014Awake, I got to party with my favorite thing ever\u2014even without having to resort to the truth.</p><p>\u201cYou know what this means, don\u2019t you?\u201d Paris asked grimly.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d No. What the hell? His brain must be addled. All he could think was that Scarlet knew how to conjure insects, but then, a three-year-old could have figured that out by now.</p><p>\u201cShe knew what scared you most. Only logical conclusion is that the woman can sense our deepest fears and present them to us while we\u2019re sleeping. Hence, nightmares.\u201d</p> <p>Great. Exactly what his life had been missing. \u201cI\u2019m not going to pay her a visit.\u201d</p><p>That earned a No, thanks from Lies.</p><p>\u201cNow hold everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re totally going to be able to talk me out of this, so I wouldn\u2019t shut up if I were you.\u201d Took him a bit, but he managed to switch off the water. \u201cDon\u2019t get me a towel.\u201d</p><p>A growling Paris tossed a fluffy white bath mat at him. Gideon missed, his bandaged nubs simply not fast enough. He bent down and after several attempts, managed to lift the material. His arm throbbed. Stupid broken bones! He tried to dry himself, he really did, but he didn\u2019t do too good a job.</p><p>Finally Paris snatched the cotton and patted him dry. \u201cYou\u2019re worse than a baby, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t grab me some clothes.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Paris disappeared into the room. A dresser drawer slid open, slammed shut, then another, and then he was striding back into the bathroom, holding out a pair of shorts and a T-shirt.</p><p>Gideon had already stepped from the stall. He could have dressed himself, but that would have required the rest of his energy. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you do it.\u201d</p><p>Another shake of that head. \u201cYou\u2019re going to go see her, at least take some weapons.\u201d Paris tugged the shirt over his head and helped him pull his arms through. He only cringed once. \u201cLike me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Gods, this was embarrassing. Being this helpless. His friend was so matter-of-fact about it, though, that some of the sting eased.</p><p>Paris rolled his eyes as he held open the shorts for Gideon to step into. \u201cJust because she\u2019s locked up doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s harmless.\u201d His gaze dropped pointedly to the still-bleeding wound in Gideon\u2019s thigh.</p><p>Gideon shrugged. \u201cCould you have picked anything more masculine for me?\u201d he asked with disgust as he eyed himself. If he hoped to impress Scarlet\u2014which he didn\u2019t, he assured himself\u2014he would fail. A plain white shirt too small for him and gray running shorts. Fabulous.</p><p>Paris crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cSo you\u2019re thinking about going without me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Alone, she\u2019d said. If he brought a friend, she might zip her pretty lips, and that he wouldn\u2019t tolerate. He wanted answers, damn it. Namely: how the hell did he know her? He wouldn\u2019t be averse to listening to her apologize for slicing him, either.</p><p>\u201cGideon,\u201d Paris warned.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not locked up, right?\u201d He lumbered into the bedroom, throwing over his shoulder, \u201cI\u2019ll be in danger the entire time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrustrating ass. Fine, but be careful,\u201d Paris called.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>After two winding hallways and a flight of stairs, he had to prop himself against a wall to remain standing. Along the way, he\u2019d run into several of his friends, and each had tried to help him back to his room. He\u2019d shooed them away as politely as possible. They were worried about him, and he loved them for it. Not that he could ever tell them that. \u201cI hate you\u201d was the best he could do. But he wasn\u2019t backing down for this.</p><p>He forced himself back into motion. As he crossed the threshold into the dungeon, the air changed completely. It was dirty now, laden with blood, sweat and even urine. Hunters had been tortured here, over and over again. How disgusted the girl must be. Perhaps huddled in a corner, shaking. Crying.</p><p>What would he do if that were the case? Probably run screaming, he mused. Only thing worse than spiders were feminine tears.</p><p>Grappling with dread, he turned the final corner. At last she came into view, and he stilled. Awareness consumed him. First thing he noticed: she wasn\u2019t crying. Or scared. Second: she was far lovelier in person than she\u2019d been in his dream.</p><p>She gripped the bars, waiting, expression blank. \u201cYou came.\u201d She didn\u2019t sound surprised, just resigned.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d As if in a trance, he closed the distance between them, the scent of night flowers suddenly filling his nose. He breathed deeply. So did Lies.</p><p>Her gaze raked him, taking his measure, cataloging his every flaw. \u201cMaybe you shouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>Again he was struck by how familiar she was, both her voice and her face, but he still couldn\u2019t figure out where he\u2019d met her. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me why.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes narrowed. \u201cTell me I\u2019m pretty.\u201d</p><p>Conceited, was she? Well, she wouldn\u2019t get what she wanted from him. \u201cYou\u2019re ugly.\u201d</p><p>Part of him expected her to gasp in horror. She didn\u2019t. In that same resigned voice, she said, \u201cTell me I\u2019m smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stupid.\u201d</p><p>Slowly her lips curled into a smile. \u201cWell, well, well. Lies. It really is you. We\u2019re together again at last.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>A DROP OF WATER hit Aeron\u2019s lips, cool and tingling, before sliding over his tongue, down his throat and into his stomach, absorbing there, then entering his bloodstream and traveling to each of his organs. Moment of contact, his heart began a perfect beat, his lungs filled with more oxygen than they\u2019d ever had and his skin reached the perfect temperature, neither too hot nor too cold.</p><p>Suddenly he could hear the birds chirping outside his window, the wind dancing past the line of trees that surrounded the fortress. Could even hear his friends in the rooms above and below his, discussing what was to be done about Scarlet, about the Hunters, and lamenting his illness.And his nose... He breathed deeply, catching the scent of bark, dewy leaves, sweat, the lemon soap Sabin used, Paris\u2019s aftershave and his personal favorite...wild sky. Olivia.</p><p>Olivia was here with him.</p><p>Maybe that was why Wrath was purring so contentedly.</p><p>Aeron pried his eyelids apart, and immediately regretted the action. So much light. Light from the bulbs in the ceiling, light from the bathroom. His walls, which he\u2019d once thought were pale silver and crumbling stone, gleamed as if those stones had somehow trapped a rainbow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re alive,\u201d Olivia said with palpable relief.</p><p>There was something different about her voice, he thought as his gaze sought her out. It was still beautiful, more so now that he could hear the subtle nuances\u2014a low rasp, banked sensuality\u2014but still different. She was perched at the edge of his bed, sky-blue eyes peering down at him. Her dark hair was in tangles around her, framing the delicacy of her features. The white robe he\u2019d forced her to don however long ago still draped her, free of wrinkles and dirt.</p><p>Her skin was... His breath caught. Majestic. That was the only word to describe it. Majestic. No, not the only word. Flawless worked, too. He could have stared at her for hours, days. Forever. She was pure, white cream. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wanted to touch her. Had to feel how soft she was. How warm she was. Had to know she was healthy and whole and she\u2019d escaped without harm.</p><p>Escaped. The word tormented him. He remembered they\u2019d been inside that crypt, and he\u2019d been shot. He\u2019d carried Nightmares into the cemetery, fallen to his knees, waiting for his friends, but he didn\u2019t recall anything after that. He fisted the sheets. Answers first, then he could allow himself a single touch.</p><p>Single?</p> <p>Concentrate. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Odd. Olivia\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t the only one to have changed. His had never sounded so smooth or strong.</p><p>She offered him a shaky smile. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d lost you. You were shot, and the bullet was laced with immortal poison, slowly killing you.\u201d</p><p>Yes, that made sense. A bullet had never affected him like that, but this one had weakened him unbearably. \u201cHow\u2019d I get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cParis and William came and got us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo trouble?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith Hunters?\u201d She shook her head, that cloud of hair dancing around her shoulders. \u201cNone. We even picked up Gilly on the way back here, but we never encountered them.\u201d</p><p>It was only a matter of time, though. As close as they were, and with the success of their demon-possession, they would attack soon enough. \u201cHow\u2019s Paris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, strong and taking care of himself now.\u201d</p><p>Or he\u2019d tricked everyone into thinking so. Paris was good at hiding his actions\u2014or lack of action\u2014behind humor and smiles. Most likely he was drinking ambrosia and neglecting his body\u2019s needs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to say that!\u201d Olivia suddenly snapped.</p><p>Aeron frowned. \u201cSay what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Her shoulders slumped. \u201cThe voice returned, telling me to do all kinds of things to your body. I\u2019ve named him Temptation, and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s a demon.\u201d</p><p>A demon? None that he knew, which could mean that someone else listed on the scrolls was hiding in town. But why torment Olivia? And with sexual thoughts, of all things?</p><p>Whatever the reason, he wouldn\u2019t stand for it.</p><p>Punish, Wrath said.</p><p>Aeron was glad the demon had recovered, as well. And yes. He wanted to punish the ones who had hurt them. He just had to\u2014</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Olivia said with a shake of her lovely head. \u201cI can see the thoughts spinning behind your eyes. We\u2019ll worry about the demon later. He\u2019s irritating, that\u2019s all. Right now, I\u2019m more concerned about you.\u201d</p><p>Sweet, darling Olivia. His protector, something he\u2019d never thought he\u2019d need. Something he\u2019d never expected to want. But he did want, desperately. Need, certainly. Yet he had to convince her to return to the heavens. In\u2014how long?</p><p>He glanced at the window, the split curtains framing a waning moon. \u201cHow long did I sleep?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost of the day and night. You\u2019re still naked, if you hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d A blush stained her cheeks. \u201cNot that that\u2019s important right now.\u201d</p><p>Most of the day and night. Which meant morning would arrive all too soon. Which meant he had eight days to convince Olivia to return home. Eight days to save himself and Legion.</p><p>Eight days to resist her.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t last. A single touch wasn\u2019t going to be enough, he admitted that now. He would want more. He would have more.</p><p>More, Wrath echoed.</p><p>Yes, more. He wasn\u2019t going to stop himself. Not this time. Selfish of him, yes, but selfish he would be. He could have died out there. Died without warning. Without knowing what it was like to sink inside her, feeling her clench around his cock, clawing his back, gasping his name.</p><p>When he knew, he would stop wondering, stop craving. He could continue on as before. And she would have had her fun. She could go home satisfied.</p><p>Selfish? Ha! He was a giver.</p><p>\u201cHow did I heal?\u201d he asked. Better question: would he lose steam midway? He didn\u2019t want her leaving this bed until she reached her peak twice. At least. He owed her. Her crack about his lack of prowess still stung.</p><p>Olivia\u2019s gaze shifted away from him. \u201cAn antidote.\u201d</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she meet his eyes? \u201cAn angel antidote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She motioned to a glowing blue vial on his nightstand. \u201cWater from the River of Life. One drop, and death is chased away.\u201d</p><p>No wonder his senses were heightened.</p><p>\u201cOnce we run out,\u201d she continued, \u201cwe\u2019ll be given no more. Which is a shame. Lysander told me the Hunters have many, many more of those poisoned bullets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will the effects last?\u201d He would\u2019ve expected Wrath to fume at being fed a heavenly substance. Instead, the demon purred a little louder, as if given a great gift.</p><p>In a snap, Aeron thought he understood. Legion represented hell, and Olivia heaven. The latter he\u2019d already figured out, but the former... He realized now that Wrath missed his home. Both his homes. High Lords had once been angels, Olivia had said, before falling from the sky. Home number one. And landing in hell. Home number two, though Wrath hadn\u2019t considered it as such until he compared it to Pandora\u2019s box.</p><p>Heaven and hell, he thought again, unsure how he\u2019d missed the connection before. Olivia and Legion. Two halves of a whole, just as he and Wrath were.</p><p>Speaking of... \u201cWhere\u2019s Legion?\u201d he asked, gazing around the room in search of her.</p><p>\u201cWilliam\u2019s distracting her, but I\u2019m not sure how long that will last.\u201d Olivia traced a finger along his breastbone. \u201cYour heartbeat is improving. Strong.\u201d</p><p>His flesh heated where they connected. More.</p><p>His ears twitched as he listened to a conversation a few rooms over. Sabin and his crew had returned from the Temple of the Unspoken Ones. A lot of them were injured, but recovering. As soon as they were better, they were going to raid The Asylum and destroy the Hunters residing there.</p><p>No one was coming to check on him, then, and there was nothing for Aeron to do at the moment. Except Olivia.</p><p>\u201cAs you pointed out, I\u2019m still naked,\u201d he found himself saying. \u201cAre you ready to have fun?\u201d</p><p>First her jaw dropped. Then she closed it with a snap. Then it dropped again. Unwilling to wait for her to acclimate to his intentions\u2014no more waiting period\u2014Aeron reached up and cupped the base of her neck, drawing her down until she was practically on top of him. Her breath hitched, and the softness of her breasts pressed into his chest.</p><p>Yes, he would have this woman. Those breasts, too. The sweet spot hopefully moistening for him even now, definitely.</p><p>\u201cWh-what are you doing?\u201d The breathy question warmed him body and soul, because there was longing in every word.</p><p>\u201cHaving you.\u201d Finally.</p><p>He lifted his head and meshed their lips together. She didn\u2019t resist, not even for a moment. No, she opened for him, meeting his tongue with her own. He could taste the freshness of the water she\u2019d given him, as well as the cinnamon of her breath.</p><p>Trembling hands flattened on him, and his heart increased in speed, racing to meet them. Her skin was hot rather than warm, and burned him just right. Silky curls tickled him.</p><p>He anchored his free hand under her bottom and tugged her the rest of the way atop him. Their bodies fit together, and her legs opened automatically, cradling him perfectly. He moaned. Yes...yes...</p><p>Yes! Wrath agreed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she rasped, and wrenched away. She even scrambled from the bed and stood to trembling legs, nearly teetering over.</p><p>Both he and the demon wanted to roar. Instead, Aeron settled his weight on his elbows and watched her. Calm. \u201cYou want me. I know you do.\u201d Gods, he could smell her arousal just then, heady feminine musk.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I won\u2019t let you rouse my passions and then leave me before I can finish.\u201d She fisted her robe, inadvertently raising the fabric and showing a hint of those beautiful calves. Calves he would lick.</p><p>\u201cOlivia, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said again, spinning away. Twice she tripped over her own feet as she made her way to his dresser. There, she propped her elbows on the surface and held her head in her upraised hands. \u201cI can\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>Was she...crying?</p><p>Aeron swallowed the sudden lump in his throat and stood. Not that. Anything but that. He was as naked as she\u2019d promised, his erection waving proudly. \u201cI want you. I\u2019m not going to deny either of us again. This I swear to you, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shut up!\u201d</p><p>He blinked. Was he making no progress, then? Had his actions ruined everything? \u201cMake me,\u201d was all he could think to say. With a kiss. Please.</p><p>\u201cNot you,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThe voice. Temptation. He wants me to raise my robe and show you that I\u2019m not wearing anything underneath.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t? Aeron licked his lips and approached. Nothing, not even one of the Hunters\u2019 bombs, could have kept him away after learning that. \u201cI\u2019ll find out for myself.\u201d</p><p>Olivia gasped when he placed his now-trembling hands on her hips. Her head lifted and she twisted to peer up at him. Her eyes were huge, watery, and his heart lurched in his chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinding out, like I told you.\u201d First he played with her breasts, cupping, thrumming the nipples, until she trembled. Then he dropped to his knees, his hands never leaving her delectable body, but following him down. \u201cYou wanted to have fun, so I\u2019m giving you fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t do this if you\u2019re going to stop midway. I\u2019ve been through too much the past few days and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d The scent of her arousal was stronger, a sultry night he wanted to lose himself in. \u201cNothing could stop me now, angel. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, so slowly, he lifted the hem of the robe. Not once did she protest, not even when goose bumps broke out over her legs. Her smooth, firm legs, a mix of honey and vanilla. When he revealed her bottom and saw that she wasn\u2019t wearing any panties, his cock jerked in reaction. Beautiful. Even his wings ached from inside their slits. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Mine.</p><p>Actually, mine. He bunched the material around her waist, holding it prisoner against the dresser and leaving her lower body bare. He cupped her, spreading his fingers over those delectable cheeks. Again she gasped. Between each of his fingers, he placed a kiss.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d she and Wrath breathed in unison.</p><p>He kissed the underside and encountered the softest skin her Deity\u2014his Deity now, too, for he realized he would always worship the one responsible for creating her\u2014had probably ever created.</p><p>\u201cAeron,\u201d she said on another of those wispy catches.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs for me.\u201d He clutched her thighs and prodded her into action, even nudging her feet apart with his knees. His blood was like fire, his need sharpening to a razor point. \u201cNow bend over. As far as you can.\u201d</p><p>There was only a slight pause before she complied. For a moment, only a moment, all he could do was stare. So pretty. So sweet. So pink. So wet. For him and him alone. Even the thought of sharing with his (once again purring) demon was abhorrent. But he would. He would take this woman any way he could get her.</p> <p>\u201cGoing to taste you now.\u201d He dipped his head and sampled her fully, distantly hearing a slap of flesh upon wood.</p><p>\u201cAeron!\u201d</p><p>His gaze flicked up. She\u2019d settled her hands on the mirror in front of her and flattened her temple against the dresser. Her eyelids were squeezed shut and her breaths shallow, her teeth chewing at her lips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t...stop,\u201d she begged him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He ran his tongue over her femininity again, lingering against her clitoris, flicking it, sucking on it. This was ambrosia. Her. Soft and pouty...his. Accepting what he did, liking it.</p><p>Though he wanted to consume her, he didn\u2019t allow himself to rush. He\u2019d gone that route with her before. This time, he would savor. This time, he would learn everything about this beautiful body.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to... Aeron...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl.\u201d He moved his tongue faster, harder against her. Her hips arched forward and back and when he found her opening, he thrust deep inside. She screamed, shuddering with her release.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know how much time\u2014minutes, hours, days\u2014passed before she calmed enough that he was able to bend down and kiss\u2014and lick\u2014the calves he\u2019d so admired before rising and paying proper homage to her lower back. There were two indentations, and as he swirled his tongue around them, his hands slid up...up...and cupped her breasts the way he knew she liked. Both of her nipples were still gloriously hard, like little pearls, and he rolled them between his fingers.</p><p>More.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d Olivia said between pants. \u201cCome inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d She was wet, yes, but he wanted her dripping. He wanted her beyond ready. She was virgin, and he would make this as easy as possible for her.</p><p>His first time had been with a minor Greek goddess. One of the three Furies. Megaera, the \u201cjealous one,\u201d as she\u2019d often been called. Her brand of loving had been violent and painful, and yet another reason he\u2019d always avoided females who preferred a strong hand from their lovers. With Olivia, though, it wasn\u2019t that he preferred gentle women over wild women, or wild women over gentle women. It was that he preferred Olivia.</p><p>As he stood, he traced his tongue up the ridges of her spine\u2014there were scars where her wings should have been, and he kissed them, too, laving them with his attentions\u2014all while yanking her robe up and over her head. Silky hair cascaded down her shoulders and back, even obscuring her breasts from the mirror\u2019s view. He had to see those breasts, he thought, brushing that hair aside.</p> <p>Through the glass, those frosted nipples came into view. He tweaked them, and she dropped her head upon his shoulder, eyes closing to half-mast. The thick length of his erection pressed between her bottom, desperate for contact, and he hissed between his teeth.</p><p>There would be no more savoring if he kept this up.</p><p>Down, down his hand went, until it reached the apex of her thighs. His fingers tunneled through the fine tuft of dark curls and into that hot, wet mound. One, two, he pushed them inside her.</p><p>They both groaned. Aeron placed a kiss at the curve of her neck, watching himself all the while. What a sight they were. His dark tattooed body behind her. Her softer, cloud-tinted one writhing in front of him. By far the most erotic sight he\u2019d ever beheld.</p><p>No. Wait. Her arms reached back, one hand gripping his head to angle him down for a kiss, the other clasping his ass. This was the most erotic sight he\u2019d ever beheld.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready, I swear.\u201d</p><p>Almost...almost... He worked a third finger inside her, stretching her, spreading that glistening moisture. And when he encountered the proof of her virginity, he paused, reveled in the sense of possessiveness flooding him\u2014mine, all mine\u2014and then gently broke through.</p><p>Mine. A cry from Wrath.</p><p>Mine. An insistence.</p><p>She tensed, even stilled against his mouth. \u201cAeron.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d rather hurt her with his fingers than his cock. \u201cSorry. Pain. Feel good. Swear.\u201d He sounded like a Neanderthal, but he just couldn\u2019t form proper sentences. Olivia was his. Utterly his. His mind was stuck on that fact, and that alone.</p><p>When she relaxed, he reclaimed her mouth, playing with her tongue, feeding her kiss after needed kiss, and soon she began writhing against him again, lost to the pleasure. Soon she was dripping, as he\u2019d craved.</p><p>Now she was ready.</p><p>Though he hated to release her, even for a moment, he did so to grip his cock. The throbbing length practically leapt into his touch, hungry for more, so much more, yet he feared spilling at first contact. Diversion. He bit down on his tongue until he tasted blood, and the boiling need was tempered. Achieved. Tenderly, he pushed Olivia back on the dresser with his free hand, chest to wood, then poised the tip of his erection at her opening.</p><p>\u201cStill ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Aeron. Do it now!\u201d</p><p>Inch by inch, he drove it inside her, allowing her to grow accustomed to his size before giving her more. All the while she gasped and moaned and beseeched him. Wrath, too. Finally, he was in to the hilt, his eyes fogging over with the force of his need to pound and pound and never stop.</p><p>\u201cAeron,\u201d she groaned, and he knew it was another plea.</p><p>He pulled out, almost all the way, before sinking back in. A curse rushed from him\u2014she had arched her hips to meet him, and rational thought fled, something inside him breaking. A tether of some sort. A tether on his restraint.</p><p>Just like that, he lost himself. Lost control, lost who he was, lost everything but the need to fill this woman with all that he was. In and out he pounded inside her, just as he\u2019d wanted. Determined, driven, possessed by far more than a demon.</p><p>He was gripping her hips, probably bruising her, surely crushing her bones, but he couldn\u2019t stop himself. He was wild, feral, existing for only this moment. This woman. Just then, she was his everything. She was as much a part of him as Wrath. He couldn\u2019t live without her. Wouldn\u2019t live without her.</p><p>\u201cAeron.\u201d She was no longer panting; she was shouting. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t you dare stop. More. More!\u201d</p><p>In his mind, only one word echoed. Mine. Mine, mine, mine. He\u2019d heard it a thousand times before, but then he was shouting, \u201cMine, mine, mine,\u201d and the sound was filling his ears, sweeping through him, heating him another degree, branding him, destroying who he\u2019d been, what he\u2019d been, then building him back up, into something new and fine and right, into the man he\u2019d always been meant to be. Her man. And that\u2019s when mine faded and another word took its place, stronger, far more necessary. Yours. He wanted to belong to her, to be hers. To be everything she\u2019d ever dreamed, to fulfill every wish she\u2019d ever made.</p><p>\u201cAeron,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>Yours.</p><p>He should have seen this coming, should have known what she was beginning to mean to him, but his resistance had blinded him. Now, reduced to his basest self, he was raw, vulnerable, operating on a visceral level.</p><p>She was his, and he was hers.</p><p>He kicked her legs farther apart, and she fell down a little, deeper into his thrusts. The gap from the dresser allowed him to reach around and stroke her where she needed. With a scream, she erupted, and as those lush inner walls gripped him, Aeron hurtled over the edge himself, hot seed jetting inside her.</p><p>\u201cAeron,\u201d she cried.</p><p>Yours.</p><p>He collapsed on her, panting, and realized there was a flaw to his \u201conly once\u201d plan. Once would never be enough. Not for him, and not for his demon.</p><p>They needed more; they couldn\u2019t possibly be satisfied until they\u2019d taken her in every way imaginable. And they could. He could. Without fear. He\u2019d lost control, but Wrath hadn\u2019t attacked her. He\u2019d lost control, but he hadn\u2019t hurt her.</p><p>She\u2019d been irresistible before, but now... He needed to be with her or his life would not be complete. He needed to make love to her every night and wake up to her every morning\u2014to make love to her again. He needed to pamper her and give her the things she craved. Like fun. Like joy. Like passion.</p><p>Like him.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d he said, the syllables broken but still a promise from him, a promise for all the \u201cmore\u201d she desired. Forever?</p><p>What are you doing? What are you thinking? You can\u2019t do this. His sweat-slicked chest pressed into her back, and he forced himself to rise.</p><p>Wrath whimpered.</p><p>\u201cAeron,\u201d she said. Then, \u201cAeron!\u201d</p><p>No, that last shout hadn\u2019t belonged to Olivia. He twisted, as did his angel, and they stiffened at the same time. William and a pretty blonde\u2014Legion, he reminded himself, surprised all over again by the change in her\u2014stood in the open doorway.</p><p>Aeron forced his wings out of hiding and wrapped them around Olivia, shielding her from view. Meanwhile, William held the humanoid demon back, but strong as he was, she was dragging him forward, her murderous gaze locked on the angel.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>OLIVIA COULDN\u2019T BELIEVE what had just happened with Aeron\u2014and what was happening now with Legion. Naked. Sex. Pleasure. Happiness. Hope. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>All dashed.Trembling, she bent down to retrieve her robe and wrenched the material over her head. Thankfully, Aeron\u2019s wings kept her concealed the entire time. How she would have loved to bask in the afterglow. To discover if Aeron had been as affected as she was.</p><p>Sex was...so much more than she ever could have imagined\u2014and she\u2019d imagined a lot, since the first orgasm he\u2019d given her. The pleasure, the satisfaction, the power of knowing you were driving someone out of their mind. The closeness, the sharing, the giving, the taking. Every minute was a miracle.</p><p>She\u2019d been alive for centuries. Why hadn\u2019t she been doing this all that time? Although, she suspected the act would not be the same with any other man. Only Aeron. Her Aeron. The man who made her ache...dream.</p> <p>Legion\u2019s high-pitched screeches drew her back to the present. \u201cBitch! Whore! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d</p><p>Temptation laughed inside Olivia\u2019s head. He\u2019d been silent during the act, having gotten what he\u2019d wanted. Why had he returned?</p><p>William still had a grip on Legion, but that grip could fail at any moment. Olivia kind of hoped it did. Someone needed to put Legion in her place, and she would be more than happy to do so. She wanted her afterglow, damn it!</p><p>\u201cDress,\u201d Olivia told Aeron, hating that another woman\u2014especially this one\u2014was seeing him like this. All those tattoos should be hers, and hers alone, to feast upon. Visually or otherwise. She wished she could have licked them.</p><p>Next time.</p> <p>Would there be a next time?</p><p>His expression was hard, unreadable, as he tugged on his pants and fastened them at the waist. Because his wings were still expanded, he couldn\u2019t don a shirt. At least dressing spurred him into action. He kicked forward, wrapped an arm around Legion\u2019s waist and hefted her into his side like a sack of potatoes.</p><p>The demon\u2019s flailing never ceased. \u201cLet me go! Let me at her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go,\u201d Aeron told William. \u201cI\u2019ll handle things from here.\u201d</p><p>There were cuts on William\u2019s face and arms, and all of them were bleeding. The warrior nodded, his lips twitching in amusement. \u201cGood luck, my friend. Oh, and just so you know, a meeting\u2019s been called. Entertainment room, ten minutes.\u201d With that, he strolled into the hallway, shutting the door behind him and whistling under his breath.</p><p>Aeron carted his bounty to the bed and tossed her onto the mattress. She bounced up and down and tried to scramble off, gaze still locked and loaded on Olivia.</p> <p>\u201cStay,\u201d he barked.</p><p>Legion froze, glaring up at him\u2014until an obvious sense of self-preservation took hold and she smoothed out her features. The self-preservation was quickly followed by determination, though, and she settled on the edge of the bed, elbows behind her, breasts thrust forward, legs on the floor but spread and ready to wrap around him.</p><p>\u201cCare to join me?\u201d she asked huskily.</p><p>Oh, no, she didn\u2019t, Olivia fumed as Temptation yelled his own denial. Enough! She stalked forward, bypassing Aeron without a word, and stopped in front of Legion. Before either of them knew what she was about, she punched Legion in the mouth.</p><p>Legion\u2019s head whipped to the side, her bottom lip split and already bleeding. Olivia\u2019s knuckles throbbed, but she welcomed the sting. Try to kiss him now.</p><p>Hard, hot hands settled on her shoulders and spun her around. Aeron wasn\u2019t looking at her but over her shoulder at Legion. \u201cStay.\u201d</p><p>The command was met with a growl, but Legion obeyed.</p><p>Aeron\u2019s gaze finally shifted to Olivia. Surprise began to swirl in those lovely violet irises, chasing away his fury. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d have to tell you to behave.\u201d</p> <p>She raised her chin. \u201cI will not tolerate being called such vile names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to.\u201d Once more his gaze moved to Legion. \u201cUnderstand?\u201d</p><p>The support surprised her. Was he...could he be choosing her over Legion? For a moment, Olivia couldn\u2019t breathe. Could barely stand. There wasn\u2019t time to bask in the wondrous sensation, however. Aeron moved around her as if she were already forgotten and crouched in front of Legion.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to hurt my\u2014the angel. I love you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know that.\u201d His tone was soft, caring now. \u201cTell me you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know it.\u201d All the anger drained from Legion, as well, and she reached out, cupping his jaw, trying to pull him down for a kiss. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Aeron removed her hands with a gentle yet forceful jerk. \u201cI don\u2019t love you in that way. I love you like a daughter. Tell me you know that.\u201d</p><p>First, anger reclaimed the demon\u2019s features. Then shock. Then fear. All in the span of a single second. Her chin trembled, and tears of abject misery filled her eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019m pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were pretty before, but that doesn\u2019t change how I feel.\u201d</p><p>Legion shook her head in denial. \u201cNo. You have to be with me. You have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen, baby.\u201d</p><p>Several droplets spilled, tumbling down her cheeks. \u201cIs this...is this because of the angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia has nothing to do with what I feel for you.\u201d</p><p>Olivia suddenly wished she were someplace, anyplace else. She shouldn\u2019t be here. Shouldn\u2019t be witnessing this private moment. Yes, that\u2019s what she\u2019d do. Go anyplace else. Her knees knocked as she walked to the door.</p><p>Stop! Where are you going? Temptation. When would the demon leave her for good?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d Legion spat. \u201cYou love her.\u201d</p><p>Her hand froze on the knob.</p><p>Silence. The answer...she had to know.</p><p>Then, \u201cLegion,\u201d Aeron said on a sigh.</p><p>Disappointment choked Olivia, but still she couldn\u2019t force herself to exit. Not yet. Maybe he would\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t love her,\u201d the demon shouted. \u201cYou have to love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I do love you.\u201d</p><p>Stomach clenching... Say them. Say the words.</p><p>\u201cNo! You have to love me like a wife. You have to pleasure me with your body. Otherwise...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOtherwise?\u201d he demanded harshly.</p><p>Olivia tensed. Oh, Deity. The bargain. She\u2019d forgotten about Legion\u2019s bargain with Lucifer. Dread, so much dread. She turned and pressed her back into the wood, shaking. Waiting. This, more than a declaration, she had to hear.</p><p>\u201cTell him,\u201d she commanded. \u201cHe deserves to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Aeron parroted.</p><p>Legion gulped. \u201cIf I fail to seduce you in eight days, Lucifer will...he\u2019ll...he\u2019ll possess my new body,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIf I fail, he\u2019ll...he\u2019ll use me to kill you and your friends.\u201d</p><p>No. No!</p><p>Aeron flicked Olivia a quick, unsure glance, not comprehending Legion\u2019s confession. \u201cPhysically, he can\u2019t leave hell. He can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can. If he possesses her, he can do anything,\u201d Olivia croaked, hand closing over her throat. Her horror didn\u2019t last long. Blood chilled in her veins, numbing the emotion. She\u2019d been so close to paradise, only to be thrust into hell. \u201cHe can breed her with anyone of his choosing, assume control of the Hunters, influence humans and turn them against you. He can even see into the angelic realm and slaughter my kind.\u201d</p><p>Aeron\u2019s spine became as rigid as a steel pipe. \u201cWhy would he want to do any of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy else? Power. Freedom. Spite. He despises angels. They were supposed to follow him, yet they chose to remain with the One True Deity instead. But most of all, he despises the True Deity. His destruction is what Lucifer craves most. With his demon High Lords freely roaming the land, he\u2019ll have a better chance of that.\u201d</p><p>Enough of this foolishness. Shut her up, Temptation commanded.</p><p>Olivia ignored him, only to blink in bewilderment a moment later. Him. She\u2019d already known the voice belonged to a male, but she now realized this male wanted her to win Aeron\u2014and more specifically, for Legion to fail. This male wanted to prevent Legion from convincing Aeron to bed her.</p><p>Not a demon, after all.</p><p>Lucifer, she realized. Lucifer was her Temptation. He didn\u2019t have to leave hell to cast his voice elsewhere, or to whisper to one particular person. He merely had to link with a soul open to corruption.</p><p>Bye-bye blessed numbness. Her horror returned, as did her dread, both mixed with shame. How could she not have known? How had she missed the truth? Stupid angel.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you make such a bargain?\u201d Aeron demanded.</p><p>The tears continued to flow down Legion\u2019s cheeks. \u201cI wanted to be pretty. To be what you needed. I thought I would win you, make you forget the angel. I thought I would make you happy.\u201d</p><p>Aeron scrubbed a hand down his face, his nails scraping, leaving angry red welts. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this. Do you have any idea what you\u2019ve done? Do you have any idea of the things you\u2019ve put into motion?\u201d</p><p>Legion nodded, chin trembling. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. So sorry.\u201d</p><p>A pause, then a sorrowful, \u201cSo am I.\u201d</p><p>With those words, Olivia knew. She knew. He\u2019d already made up his mind. Aeron would sleep with Legion. He would enter her body the same way he\u2019d entered Olivia\u2019s. To save the little demon from possession. To save his friends from Lucifer. To keep the Hunters from victory.</p><p>Tears filled her own eyes, but she blinked them back. With this act, Aeron would prove that what he\u2019d done with Olivia meant nothing. With this act, she would leave. He had to know she would leave.</p><p>Had that knowledge made the decision easier for him? she wondered with a bitter laugh. No way she could stay here, knowing he\u2019d bedded another woman. No matter the reason.</p><p>Olivia had her own choice to make, then, it seemed. She would leave, there was no question of that. Not now. But would she return to the heavens, possibly saving Aeron\u2019s life, or simply travel to a new location here on earth?</p><p>Here, most likely, for how could she possibly return home now? She was changed, human in all the ways that mattered. She would be miserable up there, bringing joy to no one, least of all herself. She would be useless. And if ever she changed her mind about having returned, she wouldn\u2019t be allowed to fall again. No, she would be put to death or permanently cast into hell. There could be no other choice for an angel who lost her way twice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But how could she stay here and live with herself, knowing she could have saved Aeron and hadn\u2019t? Even though saving him meant that he would be with another woman?</p><p>Was she truly that selfless?</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t. She should have killed him when she\u2019d had the chance and saved each of them this pain. Another bitter laugh filled her head, but this one escaped.</p> <p>Aeron rose, the action stiff, uncoordinated. \u201cWe have a little time. We don\u2019t have to take care of this right this moment.\u201d</p><p>So he didn\u2019t plan to sleep with Legion right away. That was a small comfort, at least.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Legion said, grateful, pleased and shamed all at once. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned, cutting her off, and Olivia\u2019s gaze ate him up. His masculine beauty, his power. No, she wasn\u2019t that selfless, but she was that in love, she realized.</p><p>Love. The word echoed in her mind. She loved him. Fully, utterly, wholly, completely. He was the reason her heart beat, the source of her joy. She would die for him. He was strong and brave, fierce and caring. Giving, selfless himself. What wasn\u2019t to love?</p> <p>She would stay here with him until he bedded Legion. She would soak up every moment she had with him. And then...then she would return to the heavens. She would ensure Lysander kept his end of the bargain and petitioned the Council for Aeron\u2019s life.</p><p>Still. That didn\u2019t guarantee their cooperation.</p><p>Well, she would just have to find another way.</p><p>What a difference a few days made, she thought sadly. She\u2019d come here resigned to Aeron\u2019s approaching death, happy with the time they would have and determined to experience joy as humans did. Yet she\u2019d spent time with her warrior, and everything had changed. She could no longer accept the thought of him dying. Of his courage and strength being extinguished.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Aeron,\u201d she said, squaring her shoulders. \u201cSoon I\u2019ll leave, and you and Legion will be safe.\u201d A promise welded to her soul.</p><p>Legion gaped at her.</p> <p>Lucifer screeched an unholy sound inside her head.</p><p>Aeron\u2019s lips pulled tight in a scowl, his teeth bared, his eyes red, glowing. Demon eyes. \u201cI said we have time. We don\u2019t have to take care of this now. Therefore, you will stay. Now, enough about that. I have a meeting to attend. I\u2019m going to leave the two of you in here and you will play nice. Understand? You won\u2019t like what happens if you harm each other, I promise you that.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for their replies but stormed from the room.</p><p>Unlike William, he didn\u2019t gently shut the door behind him. He slammed it, rattling the pictures on the walls.</p><p>After everything she\u2019d just agonized over, realized and decided, a little compassion\u2014and a goodbye kiss\u2014wouldn\u2019t have been amiss.</p><p>Olivia stared over at Legion. Legion stared back.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Olivia said, at a loss. She still ached from Aeron\u2019s possession. Still felt the wetness he\u2019d left behind. Yet very soon this female would be with Aeron the way she had just been with him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stay here with you,\u201d Legion lashed out.</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p> <p>Grinning, Legion jolted upright. \u201cYou\u2019re returning to the sky already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I\u2019ll be listening to what\u2019s said at the meeting.\u201d</p><p>Her grin faded, but she glanced at the door. \u201cYour ears are probably so feeble you\u2019ll need someone there to interpret the murmurings.\u201d</p><p>She offered no reply, wanting to hate the woman but unable to do so. Hate required energy, and just then she had none to spare. Besides, this demon would have been like her stepdaughter if things had progressed the way she\u2019d wanted. More than that, Legion had done what was necessary to win her man. Just as Olivia had.</p><p>Only, Legion had won.</p><p>IT WAS GOOD TO BE HOME, Strider thought, gazing around the entertainment room. All the men and women were accounted for. All three thousand of them, it seemed. Except for Gideon, who\u2014according to the gossiping hens and William, the gossiping cock, as he happily called himself\u2014was in the dungeon making nice with the newest prisoner.</p><p>The warriors, with their big, hard bodies, seemed to consume every inch of space, saturating the air with testosterone. The women perched on the couches and chairs, forcing the men to stand against the walls. Those who weren\u2019t otherwise occupied, that is.Lucien and Sabin were playing a game of pool and talking amongst themselves, probably trying to sort things out before they spoke to the group. William was sitting in front of the TV, playing a video game. Aeron and Paris were in the far corner and passing a flask back and forth. Both looked miserable. Especially Aeron. His expression was carved from granite\u2014livid granite\u2014and his tattoos were stark against his now-pale skin. And his eyes...hell. They were demon red.</p><p>Still healing from that poisoned bullet? Or something more personal?</p><p>Strider had only been home a day, but he\u2019d already heard about the man\u2019s angel problems from three different sources. Cameo, Kaia and Legion\u2014an unbelievably improved Legion. All three had been a font of conflicting information. Cameo liked Olivia, talked about how knowledgeable and helpful she was. Kaia talked about how delightfully naughty the real Olivia was. And Legion thought she was a bitch who would murder Aeron in his sleep.</p><p>Kaia thought Aeron would marry the girl. Cameo thought Aeron would kick the girl out and never see her again. And Legion thought she was a bitch and a murderer. (That was pretty much all Legion had said. Oh, wait. She\u2019d asked Strider to kill that \u201cbitch and murderer.\u201d) When he\u2019d refused, she\u2019d threatened to pay someone to \u201cdo him prison-style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m waiting,\u201d Strider called. \u201cMe no likes to wait.\u201d</p><p>Finally, Lucien and Sabin ended their game, nodded to each other as if they\u2019d reached an understanding and approached the front of the room. Conversations tapered to quiet.</p><p>Both men anchored their arms behind their backs, their legs braced apart. They were ready for action. Good thing. Everyone else in the room was tense and ready to receive that action.</p><p>\u201cWe called this meeting so that each group could bring the other up to speed on what\u2019s been happening in Rome and Buda,\u201d Sabin began. \u201cI\u2019ll go first. The Unspoken Ones want us to bring them Cronus\u2019s head, but that little deed will free them, and if they\u2019re freed...\u201d He shuddered. \u201cNo telling what evil they\u2019ll unleash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d Lucien said, picking up where Sabin had stopped. \u201cThey\u2019ve hedged their bets and asked the Hunters to bring them Cronus\u2019s head, as well. Whoever succeeds in doing so, us or the Hunters, will be given the fourth and final artifact.\u201d</p><p>The Paring Rod. No one knew what it did. Not really. Even if it was useless, Strider would\u2019ve massacred an army to possess it. If there was the slightest chance it was powerful, and there was, it couldn\u2019t end up in his enemies\u2019 hands.</p><p>\u201cBut Cronus is a god,\u201d Maddox said. And they\u2019d all been up against the gods before. That\u2019s why they were here, rather than in the heavens. That\u2019s why they were demon-possessed. \u201cWe can\u2019t contain him.\u201d Despite the grim topic, the man had never looked happier.</p><p>Why? Later. The gods had always been more powerful than they were, able to strike them down with only a wave of their capricious hands.</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s also possessed,\u201d Cameo said. \u201cHis demon will have a weakness. All of ours do.\u201d</p><p>Oh, the agony of her voice. Strider was too busy cringing to process her words.</p><p>\u201cHis demon is Greed.\u201d This was said by Aeron, and the agony of his voice was a thousand times worse than Cameo\u2019s.</p><p>Holy hell, Strider needed to gouge out his ears and\u2014Wait, wait, wait. Backtracking. Cronus was possessed by Greed. Lucien had told him this already, but Cameo had made a very good point. All the demons had a weakness. That weakness made the warriors vulnerable. His was losing and the coma that followed. Anyone could attack him then, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to protect himself.</p><p>What was Cronus\u2019s weakness?</p><p>That kind of intel would be critical in a fight...not that he planned to fight the god king, but a guy had to be prepared.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw Amun sign with his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat of Danika\u2019s painting?\u201d Strider translated. \u201cThe one where she predicted that Galen would take Cronus\u2019s head?\u201d For himself, he added, \u201cI know we\u2019re hoping we can change the course she saw, but maybe the way to change it isn\u2019t to kill Cronus ourselves. Maybe we should increase our efforts to kill Galen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Galen has the Cloak,\u201d Reyes said, striding to the couch, lifting Danika, sitting down and pulling her into his lap. \u201cHe might be harder to destroy than even a god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGalen has the Cloak,\u201d Aeron repeated, \u201cso why hasn\u2019t he acted against us? His troops have been here a while. So again, why haven\u2019t they attacked us?\u201d</p><p>Maddox shrugged. \u201cMaybe they were waiting for their little Distrust experiment to succeed. And now that it has...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to strike first,\u201d Aeron said, \u201cand catch them unawares. Hopefully we can cut their numbers significantly, buy ourselves time to figure out what to do about Distrust and maybe even force Galen out of hiding.\u201d</p><p>Good rationale, but was his bloodlust returning? Besides that glint of red in his eyes, his hands were clenched and his posture rigid.</p><p>\u201cWill they be unaware, though?\u201d Reyes asked. \u201cWhat if they\u2019re waiting for us to attack?\u201d</p><p>The soldiers on the island had waited. That might be the new Hunter M.O. Plus, a lot of warriors were still recovering from that battle. They weren\u2019t at their strongest, and their strongest would be needed for a victory of this magnitude. \u201cAnd let\u2019s not forget they\u2019ve got Rhea on their side. No telling how she\u2019ll aid them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true,\u201d Torin said, speaking up for the first time. He\u2019d placed a speaker and monitor in the room so that he could attend the meeting without actually having to enter the too-crowded room. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Cronus. He\u2019s distracting his beloved wife as long as he can today. That\u2019s why I asked Lucien and Sabin to call this meeting now. Anything we do today, we do without godly interference. From the queen or the king.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No one to hinder, but no one to help, either.</p><p>A murmur drifted through the crowd. And then a single word began to echo from everyone\u2019s lips. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t sleep, anyway,\u201d Maddox grumbled. \u201cNot with Nightmares in residence. When are we going to get rid of her, by the way?\u201d</p> <p>No one had an answer to that. The other, however, was quickly decided. Tonight, they would attack.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>GIDEON COULD HEAR the warriors shuffling around above him. Their footsteps were harried, and he thought he even detected the click of guns being locked and loaded, the whistle of metal being sheathed.</p><p>He didn\u2019t care. Didn\u2019t budge. Nearly a full day had passed since he\u2019d first entered the dungeon. After Scarlet had made her announcement\u2014Lies, we\u2019re together at last\u2014she\u2019d hissed a curse at him, said, \u201cAnd now that I know it\u2019s you, you can go,\u201d then turned her back on him, lain down on her cot and ignored him, humming under her breath as if she hadn\u2019t a care. She\u2019d fallen asleep at sunrise, nothing he did or screamed able to rouse her, and had only woken up a few minutes ago as the sun set again.She\u2019d sat up with a gasp, her gaze frantic. When she\u2019d spotted him, the wildness had left her, replaced by anger and resentment\u2014neither of which he understood\u2014and she\u2019d flopped back against the mattress.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay here all day, you know,\u201d he said. Torin, who watched him from the many cameras set up down here, must have felt sorry for him because Disease had long ago brought him a chair. A chair he had pushed as close to Scarlet\u2019s cell as possible. His long legs were outstretched, his ankles propped on the bars.</p> <p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>Hearing her voice after all that silence was like finding a pool of acid with Hunters already inside it: a whole lot of awesome. He even shivered. Thank the gods he\u2019d never be able to admit that aloud, though. Em-bar-rassing.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you\u2019re ignoring me now?\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>It would serve her right, as much as she\u2019d ignored him. \u201cYep. Ignoring you.\u201d Every cell in his body was attuned to every move she made, so even though he would\u2019ve liked to give her what she deserved, he couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Shameful. Men were supposed to be in charge, and women were supposed to be grateful for their attention. Men were supposed to give orders and women were supposed to obey them.</p><p>Okay, fine. He\u2019d never wished for that before but he abso-fucking-lutely wished for it now. Didn\u2019t help that Lies was freaking putty in her hands, quiet now, but humming softly in appreciation, just happy to be near her.</p> <p>Another bout of silence ensued, and he knew she was punishing him. For what, though, he didn\u2019t know. He hadn\u2019t been the one to lock her up. Sure, he hadn\u2019t set her free, either, but give him props for his intelligence, for gods\u2019 sake. She would have run away.</p><p>Scarlet\u2014he really liked that name. It fit her. Fit the curve of her wicked lips, the ease with which she flayed him and the darkness of her personality\u2014scrubbed a hand down her face. \u201cJust go, okay. I\u2019m done with you.\u201d</p><p>Finally. More talking. He\u2019d stay here forever, he thought, just to be near her. Which didn\u2019t make any damn sense! \u201cMy name isn\u2019t Gideon.\u201d There. Simple. Easy. And hopefully she would begin to reveal personal information about herself in exchange. Like how she knew him. Like how he knew her but didn\u2019t remember her.</p><p>\u201cDuh,\u201d was all she said.</p><p>She knew? How? He doubted she\u2019d tell him, so he didn\u2019t bother asking. \u201cI know a lot about you. Such as, you can\u2019t enter other people\u2019s dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d</p><p>Not so simple. Not so easy. \u201cI\u2019d really hate it if you left my friends alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then. Consider it done. I\u2019ll mess with them all night long, just to keep you happy.\u201d</p> <p>He stared up at the ceiling for a moment, praying for divine patience. \u201cPlease do.\u201d Damn it. He rarely minded that he could only speak in lies, but right now it was irritating the hell out of him.</p><p>\u201cOr would you like it better if I only concentrated on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yes. While he wanted his friends to be able to rest peacefully, that wasn\u2019t the real reason he wanted this woman to stay out of their dreams. He wanted her to himself. All of her. Even her ability. Just until he figured this out.</p><p>Even still, that didn\u2019t make any sense. He wasn\u2019t a possessive man. More than that, he had no reason to be possessive of this woman.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, sounding anything but. \u201cI can\u2019t promise that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t consider drugging you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of drugs? Can I request Vicodin?\u201d</p><p>So she enjoyed human drugs. He couldn\u2019t blame her. He\u2019d indulged a time or twenty. Not that they affected him much, but a little was better than nothing. \u201cHow\u2019d you know I loved spiders so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, you\u2019re talkative. If I tell you something, will you shut up? I\u2019ll take your silence for a yes. How did I know you loved spiders? Because I enter a person\u2019s mind and just sense things. That\u2019s how. Now shut it for good.\u201d</p><p>Truth. His demon recognized truth as if it were a lone Hunter in a lineup with Lords. His demon usually hated it, was usually disgusted by it, even as Gideon always savored it. Today, the demon remained quiet and happy. No matter what poured from the girl\u2019s beautiful mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat how you didn\u2019t know my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see bargaining isn\u2019t a skill you possess.\u201d She slapped the wall, and dust plumed around her. \u201cSo, what? You\u2019re going to irritate me until I tell you everything I know?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to admit that he just wanted to be with her, so he held up his bandaged hands and waved them. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more I could be doing right now. Like fighting with my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInjuries wouldn\u2019t stop a real warrior.\u201d</p><p>Ouch. \u201cYeah, \u2019cause a real warrior likes to get in everyone\u2019s way and actually aid the enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA real warrior succeeds despite his handicap.\u201d She snorted. \u201cI said handicap and you don\u2019t have hands.\u201d</p><p>Yeah. Funny. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have all my fingers, I totally wouldn\u2019t be flipping you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe action of a man with more bark than bite. Figures you fall into that sad, sad category.\u201d</p><p>What\u2019s your problem? he wanted to demand, but the words would emerge as something like: Why don\u2019t you have a problem with me? and he didn\u2019t want to hear her say, Stupid question. I do have a problem with you. He\u2019d say: Well, I don\u2019t want to know what it is, and she\u2019d say: Good, because I didn\u2019t plan to tell you.</p><p>He\u2019d had similar exchanges in the past. He was already frustrated, confused, curious, eager, and each emotion was pushing him closer and closer to the edge. An edge that always urged him to say things he didn\u2019t mean and do things he couldn\u2019t reverse.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you lose the hands, anyway?\u201d This was asked grudgingly, as if she didn\u2019t like that she wanted to know.</p><p>Her curiosity pleased him, and he lost some of his frustration. \u201cThe hands, well, they didn\u2019t disappear through torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou break?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d There was pride in his tone. He hadn\u2019t broken. Hadn\u2019t spilled a single secret.</p><p>\u201cJust as I suspected.\u201d</p><p>His jaw clenched. Somehow she knew he was Lies. Had known all along. She also knew he couldn\u2019t tell the truth, yet she continually pretended to take his words at face value. Just to piss him off? Because she was angry with him? An anger he still didn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cHunters do it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that going, by the way? The war with them?\u201d</p><p>So she knew about that, as well, when he\u2019d never heard of her involvement. How? Actually, she knew a lot that she shouldn\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019re losing.\u201d Winning, but just barely. Two artifacts against one. The liberation of all those halfling children the Hunters had created through hideous means. The discovery of their Buda hideout. Not that he could explain that to Scarlet. \u201cSince you don\u2019t seem to know me, I\u2019m wondering if you didn\u2019t come here for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she sputtered. \u201cLook, I told your friend I just wanted you guys to leave me alone. I knew you were searching for me. I wanted you to stop. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>No. That wasn\u2019t true. Couldn\u2019t be. Only, he couldn\u2019t prove it. Lies still wasn\u2019t helping. \u201cHow do you not know me? How do I feel like I don\u2019t know you when I\u2019ve met you before?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze flicked to him, narrowed and once more filled with that anger. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember me?\u201d Okay. Anger wasn\u2019t a strong enough word. Outrage had layered every word. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember specifics?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do no\u2014\u201d Lie, lie. He shouldn\u2019t have had to remind himself, damn it. \u201cYes. I do.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t have met her. He would not have forgotten a woman like her. Beautiful, wild, a predator. Blunt, hard yet somehow vulnerable.</p><p>Yeah, he\u2019d been with a lot of women over the years. Mostly one-night stands. Women didn\u2019t come back for more when the man they were with constantly told them how ugly and stupid they were. Or when the man didn\u2019t speak at all. And no, he didn\u2019t remember all their faces, but as he\u2019d already reasoned out, this was not a woman he would have forgotten.</p><p>\u201cWe were lovers,\u201d he said to get them started, \u201cso that\u2019s in.\u201d Out.</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Her gaze returned to him and lingered, perusing him up and down. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I approve of the packaging, so no, we weren\u2019t lovers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I know what you mean,\u201d he said, because he did know. She didn\u2019t like the looks of him. His hands fisted. \u201cFor your information, I\u2019m as ugly as they come.\u201d</p><p>There was something smug in her eyes as she said, \u201cYeah. I know. That\u2019s what I just said.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ran his tongue over his teeth. I\u2019m sexy, damn it! Yeah, his appearance was a little unorthodox. Blue hair, a few piercings. Tattoos\u2014although nothing on the scale of Aeron\u2019s. Boy was covered. Gideon, at least, had himself and the ink under control. He\u2019d chosen designs that meant something to him.</p><p>A pair of black eyes he saw every time he closed his eyes. A pair of bloodred...lips... He sat up with a jolt, staring over at Scarlet. Who had black eyes. Who had bloodred lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she snarled. \u201cI know I\u2019m gorgeous, unlike you, but come on. Show some manners, for gods\u2019 sake.\u201d</p> <p>For as long as he could remember, he\u2019d had images in his mind. Black eyes, red lips, even a phrase he thought of only during the darkest time of night: TO PART IS TO DIE. Bright red flowers curved beneath them.</p><p>In his mind, he\u2019d seen those words and flowers wrapping around a woman\u2019s waist. His heart accelerated every time he thought of them, so he\u2019d had the words\u2014and yes, the flowers\u2014tattooed around his waist, as well. Girly of him, and something many people had teased him about, but he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see your lower back,\u201d he told her starkly.</p><p>She stilled completely, not even daring to breathe. \u201cNot just no, but hell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not willing to beg.\u201d He had to see. Had to know. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you before. I don\u2019t know that you have a tattoo of flowers there.\u201d She did, he knew she did.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Lie, surely. \u201cDon\u2019t prove it, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Argh! Frustrating woman. He pushed to his feet. He\u2019d been sitting so long, his muscles ached in protest and his knees shook.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t get your way so you\u2019re leaving? Fine. Go sulk like a child.\u201d</p><p>First she\u2019d wanted him to leave and now she threw a tantrum because she thought he was doing so. Women.</p> <p>Bandaged as his wrists were, it was hard to grip the hem of his shirt, but after several agonizing minutes, he managed to do so. He raised the material and turned, offering Scarlet his back. At first, she gave no reaction. Then he heard a sharp intake of breath, a rustle of clothes, the patter of footsteps.</p><p>Warm fingers met his flesh, and he had to bite his bottom lip to contain his pleasured moan. Her skin was callused\u2014from using weapons?\u2014and abraded deliciously as she traced every word, every petal.</p><p>She could have had a blade hidden, could have stabbed him while he was distracted, but he couldn\u2019t make that matter. She was touching him. It was more arousing, more...everything than being inside another woman.</p><p>\u201cTo part is to die,\u201d she whispered brokenly. \u201cDo you know what it means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t tell me.\u201d Please, gods, please.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014\u201d Her hand fell away. One step, two, she increased the distance between them.</p><p>Gideon whipped around. For a moment, he forgot about the bars and reached for her. His wounds hit the metal, and he cringed. Scarlet blanked her expression as she danced out of reach.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d he commanded.</p> <p>\u201cI told you to go away, Gideon.\u201d</p><p>Gideon. For the first time, she\u2019d used his name. It affected him deeply. Slithered through him, burning each of his organs\u2014especially his speeding heart. Because...because...while this was the first time she\u2019d said his name during their conversation, it wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d ever heard her say it.</p><p>Just then he knew, knew, that he had heard her say his name before. Somewhere, sometime. She\u2019d shouted his name in passion; she\u2019d whispered his name in entreaty. She\u2019d growled his name in anger; she\u2019d cried his name in pain.</p><p>He had been with her.</p><p>\u201cDevil,\u201d he said, wishing he could say her name instead.</p><p>She must have heard the riotous emotions in his voice because for once, she didn\u2019t have a sarcastic comment.</p><p>\u201cJust go, Gideon, as I asked you to do in the beginning. Please.\u201d</p><p>Please. He doubted that was a word she said often. But then, she sounded close to tears and she didn\u2019t strike him as a woman who would relish crying in front of a man. Ever, over anything.</p><p>Except, she had before. He knew it. She\u2019d cried and he\u2019d held her. When? Where?</p><p>The only possible time would have been while he\u2019d lived in the heavens. Since she was possessed by one of Pandora\u2019s demons, she had once been a prisoner of Tartarus. He hadn\u2019t locked her away, but could he have seen her there when he\u2019d deposited other prisoners? Could he have spoken to her?</p><p>How could they have had a relationship, though, and he not recall it?</p><p>Could someone have erased his memory? Gods were capable of such things. Gods were capable of all kinds of cruel things. But that raised the question of why someone would have wanted to erase his memory. What could such a deed have gained? Prevented?</p><p>\u201cDo you not have a man?\u201d His voice was so raw, so hoarse, anyone hearing him would have thought he had yet to recover from a severe throat infection. A husband, though, would have wanted Gideon out of the picture.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, so sad her tone brought tears to his eyes. So sad her tone rivaled Cameo\u2019s, Misery herself. \u201cI do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father is dead.\u201d She lay back on the cot, peering up at the ceiling. \u201cHas been for a long, long time.\u201d</p><p>Truth? Damn it, demon! Help me. \u201cNo mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother hates me.\u201d</p><p>He would just have to take her words as gospel. \u201cIs there anyone who would want to see you...happy?\u201d Please understand that I mean miserable.</p><p>Rather than reply, she rolled to her side, facing away from him. \u201cIf I tell you what you want to know, will you leave me alone? I\u2019m not pretending to bargain with you this time, Gideon. If I do this, and you don\u2019t leave...\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to leave. Now, more than ever, he wanted to stay. But he had to know the answer. Perhaps it would help him piece this mystery together. \u201cNo. Tell me and I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>A pause. Then, \u201cI lied to you earlier, when I pretended not to recognize you. I did, from the very beginning I did. To part is to die,\u201d she croaked. \u201cThey were words you once told your...wife.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>AERON STOOD on the balcony next to his room, clutching the railing, peering into the indigo-tinted sky. Most difficult choice he\u2019d ever had to make, deciding between Legion\u2019s life and Olivia\u2019s. If he\u2019d picked Olivia, as he\u2019d so desperately wanted\u2014still wanted\u2014Legion would have suffered eternally. His friends would have been in danger. From Lucifer, no less. By picking Legion, he\u2019d saved her and his friends, and Olivia could return home, unscathed. As he\u2019d once tried to force her to do. As he now yearned to wail against. As Wrath was wailing against.</p><p>Keep her. Please. We need her.Block it out. Don\u2019t listen. A demand for himself.</p><p>Had Legion appeared just then, he might have shaken her. The position she\u2019d placed him in...the things he would have to do...to her, to Olivia... His nails elongated and bit into his palm, and the metal whined, arcing out of place. The worst, though? The things he wouldn\u2019t be able to do to Olivia. Not anymore.</p><p>No more making love. And that\u2019s what it had been. Making love. He hadn\u2019t wanted it to be, had tried to resist, but in the end, even his body had known. Being with Olivia was right. Perfect.</p><p>But now, he couldn\u2019t keep her. Even if sending her home were not a life-and-death situation, no woman would stay with him knowing he would soon sleep with someone else. And he would. Bile rose in his throat. He wouldn\u2019t allow Legion to be possessed. He wouldn\u2019t allow the destructive Lucifer into this realm.</p><p>Eventually, Olivia will thank me for this. At least, that\u2019s what he told himself in a bid for solace. If she stayed here, she would be human. She would wither and die and he would have to watch, helpless to save her. It was a prospect that had always baffled him. A prospect that had always horrified him, yet just then, he would have given anything to spend more time with her.</p><p>Can\u2019t lose her.</p><p>We must. He would have liked to hold her, there at the end of their loving, as his mind became wrapped in thoughts of being together forever. Now he had to live the rest of his life without her, knowing she was out there, that he would forever be unable to see, hear or smell her.</p><p>No!</p><p>How was he going to bed Legion when Olivia was the only female his body responded to? He laughed bitterly. He\u2019d gone from having no girlfriends, cockily assured he didn\u2019t need or want one, to basically having two. One he didn\u2019t desire. The other was ready to leave him.</p><p>Soon I\u2019ll return, Olivia had said.</p><p>Instantly he\u2019d panicked. Can\u2019t lose her now, he\u2019d thought. So he\u2019d told her they had time and that she was to stay here. All he\u2019d done was prolong the inevitable, making the split more painful when it finally happened. But he hadn\u2019t fucking cared!</p><p>\u201cAeron,\u201d a soft voice beseeched from behind him.</p><p>Heaven. Wrath sighed.</p><p>Stay strong. Resist. He didn\u2019t allow himself to face her, but called, \u201cOut here.\u201d</p><p>Soft footsteps resounded, then Olivia was beside him, gazing into the approaching night, her wild scent enveloping him. Smelling her without touching her was torture. Torture he deserved.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Legion?\u201d he asked, expecting the girl to burst through the door at any moment.</p><p>\u201cSleeping.\u201d</p><p>Without Aeron\u2019s presence? \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like her.\u201d</p><p>Olivia shrugged a delicate shoulder. \u201cIf you must know, I drugged her. And I\u2019m not sorry!\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. Gods, he lov\u2014admired this woman. The smile, small as it\u2019d been, fell away.</p><p>One of Wrath\u2019s visions suddenly opened up in his head; it was of Olivia and Legion sneaking through the fortress halls, careful to tiptoe, even while pushing each other out of the way. Legion held a bottle of wine. Olivia held two glasses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Clearly, they\u2019d gone to the kitchen. And for alcohol, of all things. But where else had they gone and why?</p><p>They reached his bedroom and Olivia said, \u201cA toast to your success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Legion said smugly. \u201cMy success. I told you Aeron was mine and would never be yours.\u201d</p> <p>Again, Aeron wanted to shake her.</p><p>\u201cAnd you were right.\u201d The color drained from Olivia\u2019s cheeks as she poured the drinks. With her back to Legion, she ripped a tiny piece of her robe from the sleeve. She then dropped that little speck of material into one of the glasses.</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d she whispered as the material dissolved, then rotated to Legion with a forced smile. \u201cI know when I\u2019m beaten.\u201d</p><p>The demon claimed the glass greedily and even before she swallowed the last drop of her wine, she began wavering on her feet. Her eyes leveled on Olivia. \u201cSomething\u2019s...wrong...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it is. Did you really think I wouldn\u2019t doctor your wine?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBitch,\u201d Legion slurred, as her knees buckled. She hit the floor snoring.</p><p>Olivia\u2019s robe could clearly do more than Aeron had realized, and at that moment, he should have been filled with a desire to drug Olivia. But to his utter amazement, Wrath was...charmed by her actions. \u201cHeaven\u201d had merely played with \u201cHell,\u201d and the demon wanted only to hold the winner of that game.</p><p>\u201cAre you angry with me?\u201d Olivia asked, drawing him from his odd thoughts.</p><p>\u201cGrateful.\u201d He was too raw to deal with Legion right now. Too raw to think about the girl he considered a daughter. Change the subject. Now. \u201cThere\u2019s something different about your voice. I noticed it earlier, but now, it\u2019s even more obvious.\u201d She\u2019d told him about Legion, but he\u2019d felt no compulsion to believe her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d was all she said. \u201cSomething\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, though he thought he knew the answer. She must be losing more of her angel-abilities the more time she spent here.</p> <p>How would her fellow angels react to that when she returned home? He didn\u2019t like the thought of them shunning so precious a female.</p><p>She gave another shrug, but this time her skin brushed his. He closed his eyes for a moment, savoring the softness. And when a cool breeze swept over the balcony, lifting her hair and tossing the strands against his bare chest, he thought his tenuous hold on sanity completely severed.</p><p>Mine. Yours. Ours. Forever. Cries from the demon, from him.</p><p>Never. A stark reminder.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, he returned his focus to the sky. \u201cYou used to live up there,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe live in clouds, which are far more than you imagine.\u201d Her affection was obvious. \u201cThey have rooms, and whatever we command, they produce. We\u2019re hidden from the rest of the world, but we can still see what\u2019s happening around us. Like angels flying past, or warriors corralling demons. We can see storms but not be touched by them. We can see the stars, blazing so close, but not be burned by them.\u201d</p> <p>Palpable excitement from the demon. Yes, yes.</p><p>\u201cAnd you gave it all up.\u201d For him. For fun. He was humbled. Guilty. Ashamed. For the most part, he\u2019d given her only pain and worry. But he was also...glad.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said again, as simply as that. Then, shifting uncomfortably, she changed the subject. \u201cWhy do you have two butterfly tattoos? I\u2019ve always wondered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one on my back is the mark of my demon, and the one on my ribs is of my own making. I wanted to always see, to always know the narrow ledge I walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you ever needed visual aid. You never seem to forget.\u201d Sadness had replaced the affection. \u201cEnough reminiscing. I know you\u2019re heading into battle tonight.\u201d</p><p>A sobering reminder. \u201cCorrect.\u201d He didn\u2019t ask how she knew about the coming fight. He could guess. She and Legion had spied on him. That\u2019s why they\u2019d left his room.</p><p>\u201cI want to go with you,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I return home now, I\u2019ll be able to join you and the Hunters won\u2019t know I\u2019m there. I\u2019ll be able to protect you, like a shield. I\u2019ll be able to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He cleared his throat and offered more gently, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The railing whined again, bending, and he pulled his fingers free, one by one. Again, he thought, Can\u2019t lose her now. Again Wrath whimpered. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p><p>They still had time, damn it.</p><p>\u201cI have to leave anyway, so why not now? Why not do so while I can help you?\u201d</p><p>Any other time, he would have admired such determination. Now he turned to her, snarling, \u201cWhy would you want to help me? Why aren\u2019t you screaming at me? Ranting about what I\u2019m going to do?\u201d That would have been easier to deal with.</p><p>Instead, she gazed up at him through calm eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for me to resort to such emotions. I\u2019m an angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFallen,\u201d he corrected darkly, then blinked. This was the first time he\u2019d ever acknowledged the distinction, and oh, the irony sliced deep.</p><p>There was a pause, a regretful sigh. Then, \u201cNot for much longer I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Mine.</p><p>He crowded her, closing the rest of the distance between them, fisting her robe and anchoring the handfuls of fabric against the railing so that she couldn\u2019t escape. Did she not care that they would be parted? Did she not care that they would never again be together? That they would never again make love? That he would soon do something vile, unforgivable?</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Aeron.\u201d Still so calm.</p><p>Never, he thought.</p><p>Never, Wrath agreed.</p><p>We can\u2019t think like that. \u201cWill your people treat you differently when you...go back?\u201d Even saying it was difficult, but he needed the reminder. \u201cYou won\u2019t be the same person you once were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll welcome me home.\u201d She shook her head and more of those silky tendrils danced over him. \u201cWith the exception of our Council, they\u2019re very tolerant. Very patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLysander doesn\u2019t strike me as either one of those things.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wryly. \u201cWell, he isn\u2019t a typical angel.\u201d</p><p>That smile...he needed more. Had to have more. As many as possible, until... \u201cThere are seven days left.\u201d The words croaked from him. Stupid. Still, he pressed their chests together, felt her nipples bead, and just like that he hardened, ready. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll stay six.\u201d</p><p>The calm finally left her, a storm brewing. \u201cWh-why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust promise me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Please, Wrath echoed, as pitiful as Aeron. Who would have thought they\u2019d be reduced to this?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She looked away from him, over his shoulder.</p><p>But not before he saw the tears swimming in her eyes. Tears that undid him...emasculated him. He reached up and cupped the back of her neck, forcing her to face him, to see his desire\u2014and a determination that surely rivaled hers.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s a maybe?\u201d</p><p>A shaky laugh escaped her. \u201cNo. That\u2019s a no.\u201d</p><p>I did that. I made her laugh. \u201cWhat can you promise me?\u201d At this point, he\u2019d take anything.</p><p>\u201cA...a day,\u201d she offered shakily.</p><p>A day. A day wasn\u2019t enough. Eternity might not be enough. His grip on her tightened. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay until I return from town. Even if that\u2019s a little longer than twenty-four hours. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is that so important to you?\u201d she demanded, letting loose the first hint of that churning tempest.</p><p>Because I need you. Because I want you. Because I hate the thought of being away from you. Because, if it were only you and me, and my decisions didn\u2019t affect anyone else, I would willingly die just to have another minute in your arms.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll stay?\u201d he insisted, ignoring her question. \u201cIf I think there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ll leave, I won\u2019t be able to concentrate.\u201d He\u2019d never manipulated before. He stated facts, for better or worse, unconcerned by the results. Now... \u201cI\u2019ll be an easy target, perhaps injured again. So tell me. Tell me you\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, and her shoulders sagged. \u201cI\u2014All right.\u201d</p><p>Not good enough. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll stay until you return from town.\u201d</p><p>Without that layer of truth in her voice, he didn\u2019t know whether she lied to him or not. But he chose to believe her, because he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of her absence.</p><p>\u201cNow that we\u2019ve got that settled, will you let me go?\u201d Even as she spoke, she placed her hands on his chest, not pushing him away but tracing his tattoos.</p><p>Mmm. Wrath sighed.</p><p>She might not want to want him just then, but want him she clearly did. \u201cWhy do you desire me?\u201d he demanded, another fierce reminder of the obstacles between them. \u201cWhy did you pick me? Beautiful as you are, smart as you are, sweet as you are, you could have anyone. Someone not covered with pictures of their sins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d A mutinous answer, though she didn\u2019t back away.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He shook her now, desperate for the truth for reasons he didn\u2019t care to contemplate. \u201cPlease, Olivia. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps it was the please that swayed her. Perhaps the savageness of his actions. Either way, she shouted, \u201cBecause you aren\u2019t what you believe you are. You aren\u2019t what everyone else believes. You might have delivered countless deaths but you love more fiercely than anyone I\u2019ve ever known. You give of yourself with no thoughts to your own happiness.\u201d She laughed, and it was as bitter-sounding as his own had been. \u201cFunny, isn\u2019t it? The very qualities that brought me to you are the things that are sending me away.\u201d</p><p>Stay.</p><p>He quashed the plea before it escaped. Loved more fiercely? By gods, he would. Now, this moment, before time betrayed him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Without any warning, he meshed their mouths together, unable to stop himself, thrusting his tongue inside. She opened without protest, eagerly accepting his brutality. Good thing. He had no control, and was glad for it. He had only a beginning\u2014Olivia\u2014and the hated end\u2014her loss. And that loss...gods. Losing her would slay him.</p><p>No, he thought then. Her kiss would. His demise rested in this meeting of souls, he realized, and again, he was glad. He tasted and claimed and conquered without reservation. He gave and he took.</p><p>If this were the end, he would die like a warrior.</p> <p>\u201cI will make you mine, woman.\u201d He jerked her robe around her waist. Her legs, bared. Her core, his. Still she wasn\u2019t wearing any panties, and the knowledge nearly floored him. One day, he wanted her on a bed. Wanted to remove her clothing slowly, take her lingeringly. Savoring every second, every breathy sigh.</p><p>Now, he just wanted her.</p><p>Urgency rode him as he reached for the button on his pants, tried to open\u2014it caught, so he ripped them apart. His cock sprang free. \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready for me, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>READY FOR HIM? Olivia thought she would be ready for this man every minute of every day for the rest of her life. He was peering down at her as if she were necessary for his survival. As if he lived only because she did.</p><p>And this would be the last time she ever experienced such a gaze.Sadness threatened to overwhelm her, but the force of her desire beat it back. Later. Later she could wallow in her misery. But for now, she was in Aeron\u2019s arms. Her body was on fire for him. She was wet and shaky and aching all over.</p> <p>This was what she\u2019d given up her wings for, after all. This was what she\u2019d given up eternity for. And here it was, hers for the taking. No matter what happened next, she would always have this.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d he said, her name a guttural beseeching.</p><p>\u201cReady. Promise.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her bottom, lifted her, and as she wound her legs around his waist, he drove inside her, all the way to the hilt. She cried out, unable to strangle the sound. As big as he was, he stretched her, but as sore as she should have been, considering they\u2019d done this not long ago, her pleasure was unparalleled.</p><p>\u201cNeed you.\u201d In and out he thrust.</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Her nails dug into his back, scouring. There was no holding back, not for her. She needed this. Needed this memory to keep her warm at night. \u201cJust like that.\u201d</p> <p>Harder and harder he pounded inside her. It was heaven and it was hell. So good, so close to ending. Last forever, she prayed, but she knew it wasn\u2019t a prayer that would be heeded.</p><p>The railing rocked with them, whining, then finally giving out entirely. Over they tumbled, falling...falling...Aeron never slowed his thrusting. She loved it, reveled in it, the wind whipping around them. Freedom and love and pleasure, all wrapped together. Without fear or regret. Aeron would keep her safe.</p><p>And he did. Just before they hit, he twisted and his wings expanded, gliding them to a slow stop. He settled her gently on the ground, those thrusts continuing still, never ceasing. She kept her legs locked around him, accepting him, arching up into him, desperate and eager and lost.</p><p>The sun fell steadily, pretty and pink, and anyone looking down would be able to see them. She didn\u2019t care. Her need was too great.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d he panted.</p><p>\u201cAeron.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes met, his violet irises wild. His expression was taut, feral, his lips thinned and bleeding from where she must have bitten him. There was something so hauntingly beautiful about him like this. Something so savagely tender.</p><p>\u201cYou are mine,\u201d he gritted out.</p> <p>More than anything, she wanted to be. \u201cYours.\u201d Until he gave himself to Legion. Then, as the girl had said, Aeron would be hers. Stop. Enough. She had now, this moment.</p><p>As though sensing her thoughts and wanting to drive them away, he lowered his head and kissed her again, this one even more wonderfully vicious than the last, his tongue stabbing at hers, his teeth grinding against hers. So much passion...</p><p>She scratched and bit and shouted, hurtling over the edge of sanity, once again falling, this time spiraling apart, screaming, clutching at her lover, every muscle in her body spasming deliciously. There. Oh, yes, there. He hit her just right, and her orgasm soared higher. She couldn\u2019t see, her eyelids squeezed firmly, but she felt him shudder over her. Heard him roar her name.</p><p>When he collapsed on top of her, his weight crushed her, but she loved it too much to offer a rebuke. If only they could stay like this forever, lost in the here and now.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d he croaked.</p><p>Slowly she blinked open her eyes. Aeron was watching her, his features somehow stripped bare. Open, needy. \u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d she said. If he planned to tell her that this had changed nothing, she knew that and didn\u2019t need him to sink the knife deeper into her chest. If he planned to ask her to stay, even though he had to be with Legion, even only once, she would be tempted to do so. Even though the Council would send someone to kill him. Even though images of him with the demon would haunt her forever.</p><p>No matter which way this played out, they were doomed.</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d His voice was throaty. \u201cI want you to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Aeron,\u201d someone called. \u201cHate to interrupt, but it\u2019s time to go.\u201d</p><p>Caught again, she thought with a sigh. Would they never be allowed to enjoy the afterglow humans so praised? Except, this time she was glad of the reprieve. She scooted out from under Aeron and stood, smoothing her robe to her ankles.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she said without looking down at him. \u201cAs promised, I\u2019ll be here waiting.\u201d And then we\u2019ll say goodbye.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>3:00 A.M. MOONLIGHT was no longer quite so bright, and the streets were deserted. Shops were closed, and partying humans had finally left The Asylum. The lights were out, not a single movement inside.</p><p>About a hundred yards away, Aeron was crouched beside Strider in a shadowed corner. The warrior held a remote control and a tiny four-wheeler with an even tinier camera attached to its roof. Apparently that camera could cut through the dark, filming faces and bodies as clearly as if they were bathed in sunlight.Torin always found the coolest toys. The proof rested in Strider\u2019s wide grin as he launched the vehicle forward.</p><p>The rest of the men were scattered around the building. A building they\u2019d once helped restore\u2014a building they were about to destroy. Some were high on rooftops, gun barrels pointed down. Others were on the street like Aeron, hidden in different locations.</p><p>Aeron lifted the portable monitor that would allow him and Strider to see through the camera\u2019s lens. And sure enough, the buildings and roads he\u2019d traversed since their creation were visible. Amazing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d he told Defeat.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready for you, Willie,\u201d Strider said into his earpiece.</p><p>Aeron wore a headset, as well, and heard William\u2019s reply. \u201cGods, I can\u2019t believe I let Anya talk me into this. I\u2019m going in.\u201d</p><p>A few seconds later, William abandoned his post and rounded a corner. His clothes were disheveled, and he clutched a bottle of whiskey. He bore no resemblance to himself, his dark hair now bleached, his piercing blue eyes hidden by dark contacts. And his face...somehow, he\u2019d roughened his skin and changed the shape of his features.</p><p>Every step he made looked as if it threatened to topple him over, but he managed to belt out a love song while moving forward.</p><p>Mocking bastard. Not that he knew Aeron planned to betray Olivia.</p><p>Sweet Olivia.</p><p>Mine, his demon stated.</p><p>Ours. No. He nearly smashed the device he held. No one\u2019s. Not Wrath\u2019s, and certainly not his. Except...</p><p>How was he supposed to go on without her? She was light, and she was happiness. She was love, and she was bliss. She was...everything.</p><p>\u201cYou with me, Wrath?\u201d Strider muttered.</p><p>The question came just in time, drawing him to the present. He watched as William tripped, as planned, and crashed into the front door of the club. Distraction. Glass shattered as he fell. He lay there a moment, sputtering drunkenly. The remote-controlled truck raced over the shards of glass, slipping inside the building unnoticed.</p><p>Didn\u2019t take long for a flood of armed men to come barreling toward the immortal.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, he reeks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet him out of here and clean this up. Now!\u201d</p><p>Two of the guards latched onto William roughly, hauling him to his feet. \u201cHey, gents,\u201d he slurred in an appalling British accent. \u201cThis where the party\u2019s at? Oh, lookie. A gun. How bloody manly. But I should probably warn the angels on the hill. Can\u2019t encourage crime, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoss?\u201d one of the men holding William said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just let him roam. He\u2019s seen too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019m not your boss,\u201d William said, then he frowned and clutched his stomach. \u201cSecond, I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d</p><p>The man in charge\u2014Dean Stefano, Galen\u2019s right-hand man, Aeron realized, even as Wrath prowled through his head, ready to hurt, to kill\u2014flicked his attention to William before turning back to the shattered remains of the door. \u201cMake it look like he was mugged. And do it away from the building. I don\u2019t want anyone sniffing around here.\u201d</p><p>A cold, utterly uncaring death sentence for a man they assumed was human. Humans, the very beings they allegedly strove to \u201cprotect.\u201d But then, Stefano was a cold, uncaring man. He blamed the Lords, particularly Sabin, for his wife\u2019s suicide, and wouldn\u2019t rest until all of them were dead.</p><p>Punish...</p><p>In the past, Aeron would have secretly loved the demon\u2019s command and hated himself for it. No matter how much the victim deserved what he dealt. But no longer would he castigate himself. Losing Olivia was reason to rage. Destroying someone evil? A reason to rejoice. And he would.</p><p>He\u2019d have fun.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>The two guards jerked a now-protesting William outside. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Just let me go and we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShut up, asshole, or I\u2019ll cut out your tongue.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when William began sobbing like a child. If Aeron hadn\u2019t known better, he would\u2019ve thought the warrior was truly scared. But he did know better. This was all part of the role William had volunteered to play. And by \u201cvolunteered\u201d he of course meant \u201ccaved to Anya\u2019s threats to burn his book if he didn\u2019t cooperate.\u201d They\u2019d hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to this, to what was about to happen, but deep down they\u2019d all known it would.</p><p>William couldn\u2019t free himself and run; that might raise their suspicions, put them on guard. He had to take whatever was dished, and let the men walk away afterward.</p> <p>The guards rounded a corner and hurried down a back alley, out of sight. Even though Aeron could no longer see them, he could hear what was happening through his earpiece.</p><p>When they reached their destination, their footsteps tapered to quiet.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean any bloody harm,\u201d William cried.</p><p>\u201cSorry, pal, but you\u2019re a liability now.\u201d Next there was a slide of metal against leather, followed by the rip of flesh and muscle. A grunt. Another rip, another grunt.</p><p>William had just been stabbed. Twice.</p> <p>Aeron flinched in sympathy. To take whatever was dished, just to leave an enemy unsuspecting, required guts\u2014guts William was probably spilling all over the pavement. He\u2019d survive, though, and he\u2019d be able to repay the favor. They all would.</p><p>He heard clothing rustle, then a thump. William must have dropped to the ground and slumped over as if dead. The footsteps started up again, and then the two guards\u2014smiling now over a job well done\u2014were once more rounding the corner. They headed back inside.</p><p>Strider kept the hidden car trained on Stefano and the workers even now boarding up the hole. Finally, they finished up.</p><p>\u201cFuckers,\u201d William grumbled in his ear. \u201cThose two are mine. They went for my sweet, innocent little kidneys.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing sweet or innocent about William. Not even his kidneys.</p><p>\u201cJust a few minutes more,\u201d Aeron promised.</p> <p>\u201cI want two guards at this door until morning,\u201d Stefano barked. \u201cThe rest of you go back to what you were doing. And for fuck\u2019s sake, someone contact Galen. Better we tell him what happened than he hear it from someone else.\u201d</p><p>The two who\u2019d stabbed William nodded and claimed their posts.</p><p>So Galen wasn\u2019t there. Disappointing.</p><p>As Aeron watched, the rest of the Hunters filed out of the lobby, through the club and down a hallway. Strider stared at the monitor as he maneuvered the car silently behind them. In that hallway were several doorways. One, the camera showed, led to a room where a few Hunters were relaxing in front of a TV. In the second room, a few were peering at screens and clicking at computer consoles, much like Torin did. In the third, bed after bed stretched. Several Hunters were clearly sleeping in them.</p><p>Stefano entered the fourth, an empty room. There were no people and no furnishings. There was only a rug. A rug that had been flung aside to reveal a dark, yawning void. A void into which Stefano descended.</p><p>An underground tunnel.</p><p>Digging their way to the fortress?</p><p>Planning to sneak inside, never having to deal with the traps on the hill?</p> <p>\u201cWe have the location of their hideaway,\u201d Strider said smugly.</p><p>Go time. For Aeron at least.</p><p>\u201cYou know which way you have to go?\u201d Strider asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d As he\u2019d watched the monitor, he\u2019d memorized his path.</p><p>Strider patted his shoulder. \u201cMay the gods be with you, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you.\u201d Aeron pushed to his feet. He hadn\u2019t worn a shirt because he\u2019d known he would be flying. With a single mental command, he popped his wings free from their slits. Grateful for the freedom, they stretched to full length.</p><p>\u201cGood luck, my man,\u201d Paris said.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d a few others echoed.</p><p>\u201cIf anything happens to me,\u201d he said to no one in particular, \u201cmake sure Olivia returns home safely.\u201d</p><p>Aeron didn\u2019t wait for their replies, but shot into the air.</p><p>Punish...</p><p>He soared high...higher...moving so quickly he would be no more than a blur to any camera in the area. Even one that could cut through shadows. Finally, he leveled out and hovered.</p><p>Punish...</p><p>Below him was the club. He searched the darkness, but there were no Hunters on the roof, and he couldn\u2019t see the Lords he knew were scattered nearby.</p><p>Tonight, victory would be his.</p><p>Punish...</p><p>My pleasure. \u201cDescending now.\u201d Down, down he fell, wind whipping over his skin, wings tucked into his sides, increasing his momentum. When he reached the building, he flattened out and burst through the wooden slats that had just been erected. They brutalized his wings, cutting and breaking them, but they also knocked down the guards.</p><p>Aeron didn\u2019t pause, but flew through the lobby, the dance arena, and then the hallway. Hunters had heard the newest crash and were springing into action, but they were doing so behind him, too slow to catch him. Only when he reached the room with the rug did he finally stop.</p><p>Wrath laughed, images flashing through Aeron\u2019s mind. The sins of his targets. Beatings, stabbings, kidnappings. So much violence, so much hatred. These men deserved what they got.</p><p>\u201cDemon!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop him!\u201d</p><p>He hid his wings\u2014or tried to. Once again they were too mangled to fit into their slots. No matter. He strode toward the repositioned rug just as Hunters reached the doorway. A bullet cut through his back, but he didn\u2019t slow. He simply spun as he walked, withdrawing a gun from his underarm sheath and firing, sending several men ducking for cover.</p><p>A reprieve. He threw back the thick, colorful mat.</p><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Another bullet whizzed behind him and slammed into his side.</p><p>He returned fire.</p><p>Amid the new gunshots, he heard his friends pounding into the building. Soon there were grunts and screams. Shattering glass. No time to rejoice. Yet another bullet hit him, this one in his thigh, dropping him to his knees.</p><p>\u201cSome help,\u201d he gritted into his earpiece. He continued to fire, sending the Hunters back into hiding. He couldn\u2019t hold them off much longer. The gun\u2019s clip was\u2014empty. Shit. He tossed the now-useless piece to the floor.</p><p>Punish. More. More!</p><p>\u201cAlmost there,\u201d Strider panted as the shooting started up again.</p><p>Aeron withdrew a second gun just as his friend arrived. Within moments, bodies were falling forward, motionless, then Strider was peeking inside. Blood splattered his face, but his eyes were gleaming brightly and a smile kicked up the corners of his lips.</p><p>\u201cGet everyone out,\u201d Aeron told him. \u201cIt\u2019s about to blow.\u201d</p><p>Strider nodded and was off, shouting warnings to their fellow warriors.</p><p>Aeron jerked at the latch on the tunnel door; it held. Though his arm was throbbing, trembling, he squeezed his weapon\u2019s trigger over and over until the metal splintered apart.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d Strider\u2019s shout echoed through their earpieces.</p><p>Aeron didn\u2019t allow himself to wallow in the pain he felt\u2014pain that would soon intensify. He didn\u2019t allow himself to acknowledge the drugging lethargy even then working through his bloodstream. Courtesy of the Hunters\u2019 poison, he was sure. He simply grabbed a grenade from the pouch at his waist and pulled the pin with his teeth.</p><p>He tossed open the door\u2014multiple guns fired at him simultaneously, hitting, hitting, peppering his body with holes\u2014and, pushing himself into the air with what strength remained in his legs, he dropped the grenade.</p><p>Wrath uttered another of those joyful laughs. Punish!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The ensuing blast of air sent him crashing through the roof. When he stilled, he grabbed another grenade, pulled the pin, and dropped it through the void he\u2019d created.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Wood and glass shards soared in every direction, cutting him further, knocking him off course. Still he persevered. His wings were now so broken they barely flapped, but he managed to work himself higher. At a safe distance, he stopped. Hovering, though, proved impossible.</p><p>As he fell, he swept his gaze around the surrounding area. Plumes of black smoke shielded the building. But through them, he could see crackling gold flames licking their way toward the sky.</p><p>None of the humans could have survived this kind of carnage. He, however, was unwilling to leave anything to chance. He withdrew the third grenade and as he closed in on the building, he dropped it.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Once again, he was shot upward. The new flames made contact, singeing his skin. He twisted midair, letting his back take the brunt of the damage before twisting again, changing direction and finally falling and hitting the ground where he\u2019d first waited with Strider.</p><p>His friend was already there. \u201cI could kiss you,\u201d was the first thing the warrior said. \u201cEven though you look like shit.\u201d</p><p>Aeron would have laughed, but he\u2019d inhaled smoke and his throat was raw and swollen. He was barely breathing. His eyes teared from the burn, and he didn\u2019t have the strength to swipe the drops away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you want a report,\u201d Strider added, helping him to his feet. \u201cWilliam managed to cut the throats of the guys who cut his guts. Paris took a bullet to the stomach, and Reyes got hammered in the kneecap. They aren\u2019t faring so well, so Maddox and Amun are helping them home. Exactly where you need to be. Lucien\u2019s gonna remain behind to escort the dead souls to hell, and Sabin\u2019s gonna stay with him just in case he has to leave his body behind. Or there are survivors. If the tunnel is deep enough, those who ran could have been protected from the blast. And you know how Stefano likes to run.\u201d</p><p>Dizziness swept through him, mild at first, then raging, flooding, and if it weren\u2019t for Strider\u2019s arm snaking his waist, he would have fallen. Worse, darkness was descending.</p><p>\u201cThey used poisoned bullets, definitely,\u201d Strider said, mirroring his earlier thoughts. \u201cLike the one that almost killed you. How\u2019d you survive? What did you do?

If he passed out before he explained what was needed, his friends would suffer. They might die before he awakened or Olivia explained. \u201cRiver. Drink.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re thirsty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater. Men. Must. Drink. Water. Life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAeron, I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Strider said, his frustration clear. \u201cThe men who were shot need water? How will water save them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWater life. Only need...little. Olivia. Olivia...know.\u201d And then the darkness dragged him under completely.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p> <p>OLIVIA PACED the confines of Aeron\u2019s bedroom. Legion was still sleeping, but she\u2019d been moaning the past hour so Olivia knew she would awaken at any moment. And wouldn\u2019t that just be a treat?</p><p>\u2014can\u2019t give up, Temptation\u2014Lucifer\u2014was saying. He\u2019d been jabbering for hours. You must win Aeron.Allowing a prince of darkness to win, as well. Never. That was something she\u2019d fought against her entire life. Victory was all that truly mattered, even at the expense of her own happiness. And that\u2019s exactly what the price was. Her happiness.</p><p>He needs you.</p><p>\u201cQuiet.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019ll be miserable without you.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019ll deserve every bit of that misery.\u201d Holy Deity, who was she becoming? That kind of attitude wouldn\u2019t serve her well in the heavens. Yes, angels were tolerant and patient, as she\u2019d told Aeron, but that didn\u2019t mean they had to like who she\u2019d become.</p> <p>If you leave, you\u2019ll never be allowed to taste him again.</p><p>A whimper escaped her. She wanted to hit the wall. \u201cYou are a thief, a liar and a destroyer. You will leave me alone. Or by my Deity, I will request Lysander be sent into the depths of hell to silence you. We both know that request will be granted. You are not to consort with the angels.\u201d</p><p>You\u2019re no longer an angel.</p><p>\u201cI will be.\u201d</p><p>Lucifer screamed in frustration, but didn\u2019t say another word.</p><p>\u201cYour voice is so annoying,\u201d Legion mumbled as she sat up. She rubbed the sleep from her eyes. She must have forgotten how she\u2019d fallen asleep, because she didn\u2019t leap up and attack. Either that, or she didn\u2019t care about retribution now that she knew Olivia would be leaving. \u201cWhere\u2019s Aeron?\u201d</p><p>Anger draining as concern swept through her, Olivia stopped at the vanity and plopped into the chair, facing the bed. \u201cHe\u2019s raiding a Hunter camp.\u201d Was he all right? She\u2019d left his balcony doors open so that he could fly straight into this room. Though forever had passed, he hadn\u2019t yet appeared.</p><p>Legion yawned. \u201cOh. Well. He\u2019ll be home soon, then. My man kills quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Her man. Yes. He was now. Once again, Olivia wanted to punch the wall. A hole would leave some reminder of her. A reminder they could patch up when she was gone, but whatever.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t important now.</p><p>A cool breeze had been dancing in through the open door, but for the past few minutes, she\u2019d felt something sinister in the air. A sign of Lucifer\u2019s presence, perhaps, or something else? The dark hints of smoke stung her throat, burned her eyes.</p><p>Perhaps the battle had already erupted.</p><p>Was it over? Was Aeron hurt?</p><p>Licking her lips, she wrapped trembling fingers around the vial she\u2019d slipped into her robe\u2019s pocket. The River of Life. She lifted the cold glass and studied the swirling blue liquid. Only a drop had been used, and there was plenty more. Would he need another drop this night? More than a drop?</p><p>If so, how long would the contents last?</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Legion asked with a yawn.</p><p>No longer did Olivia have to tell the truth, so she could have lied to Legion and kept the healing water a secret. But she wasn\u2019t going to be around much longer, and she wanted the Lords to have access to the contents.</p><p>She explained what it was while reluctantly approaching the girl. When she held out her hand, the precious vial resting in her palm, she said, \u201cHere. I want you to have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no.\u201d With a grimace, the demon batted her hand away.</p><p>The vial slapped against the mattress, and Olivia anchored her fists on her waist. \u201cLegion!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour River of Life ruins our water system. We can\u2019t even bathe after a single drop of that crap has contaminated just one of our five streams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow sad for you. Just make sure the Lords use it sparingly. The longer it lasts, the more times you can bring Aeron back from the brink of death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can save Aeron?\u201d Legion\u2019s distaste had yet to dissipate, but she pinched the vial between her fingers, then smashed it between her cleavage. \u201cI\u2019ll use it sparingly. Promise.\u201d</p><p>Olivia believed her. If anyone would see to Aeron\u2019s health and make sure the warrior came first, it was Legion.</p><p>Should have been me.</p><p>She moved to the terrace but remained just inside, resting her head on the door frame. The moon was still high, still golden, but the stars were hidden behind that smoky film. She couldn\u2019t see the city lights any longer, just trees and hill. Her worry increased.</p><p>You need a distraction. \u201cWhy do you love Aeron?\u201d she asked before she could stop herself.</p><p>A pause, then, \u201cHe plays with me. He makes sure I\u2019m happy. He protects me.\u201d Legion probably didn\u2019t realize it, but she sounded defensive.</p><p>Hinges squeaked as the bedroom door suddenly swung open, and Olivia turned, heart suddenly slamming against her ribs. \u201cAeron?\u201d No one replied because no one was there. And with the door now thrown wide, she could see that the hallway was empty, too. The breeze must have been stronger than she\u2019d thought. When would he return?</p><p>The others, the women, were camped out in the attic with Gwen, Sabin\u2019s wife, acting as their protector. Just in case someone dug through the floor, Torin had explained. Something Olivia didn\u2019t understand, though he\u2019d mentioned a text message. Anyway, she liked Gwen, had from the first moment she\u2019d seen her, scared to be here, hating what she was. Now Gwen was confident. Happy. Like I want to be.</p><p>She\u2019d been grateful for the woman\u2019s offer to join her and the others, but Olivia hadn\u2019t wanted to leave Legion sleeping helplessly. And when Gwen had offered to carry the demon to the upper level, she should have caved, but again, she\u2019d said no. This was her last night inside the fortress. She hadn\u2019t wanted to spend it with a group of women she knew but who didn\u2019t really know her. They would have questioned her about Aeron, and she just couldn\u2019t deal with that right now.</p><p>Besides, Torin watched every inch of this place. He would sound an alarm if anyone besides a Lord even approached it.</p><p>With a sigh, she strode to the door and closed it, then ambled back to the terrace entryway. Her gaze flicked to Legion along the way. The demon was still lounging on the bed, but now she was studying her nails as if she couldn\u2019t believe how pretty they were.</p><p>Where had they left off? \u201cIf you love someone,\u201d Olivia said, \u201cyou want them to be happy. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. Hence the reason I\u2019m going to sleep with Aeron. It\u2019ll make us both happy.\u201d</p><p>Had Olivia ever been this clueless? \u201cNo. It\u2019ll make you happy. He thinks of you as a daughter. By forcing him to do this, you\u2019re going to destroy him. You\u2019re going to keep him wallowing in guilt, just like his tattoos do, a constant reminder of what he is, what he\u2019s done and what he can never have.\u201d</p><p>Those nails ripped into linen. \u201cAnd you think you can make him happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I can,\u201d she said softly. Or knew she would have. The way he\u2019d made love to her that last time...that hadn\u2019t just been about pleasure. That had been about a meeting of souls. A promise of what could never be. \u201cHe needs me.\u201d</p><p>There was a very masculine laugh behind her. \u201cWell, well. A demon Lord in love with an angel. I can\u2019t believe my luck.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyes widened as she spun. She didn\u2019t recognize the voice\u2014not Lucifer, then\u2014nor did she see anyone in the room. Great. Another invisible tormentor. Who was it this time? Was this her payback for all the times she\u2019d spied on Aeron unseen?</p><p>\u201cWho said that?\u201d Legion demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou heard him?\u201d What did that\u2014</p><p>Strong hands suddenly settled atop Olivia\u2019s shoulders, propelling her outside and forcing her to face the sky. Before she had time to resist, those hands shoved her over the railing she\u2019d repaired in Aeron\u2019s absence, and she was falling down, down, down.</p><p>For the first time in her life, falling terrified her. \u201cThe water,\u201d she screamed to Legion. \u201cDon\u2019t forget the\u2014\u201d</p><p>She would have said more, but something hard clamped over her mouth. Something else, just as hard, snaked around her waist, jerking her back into a solid wall. She leveled out, began to lift higher, higher still.</p><p>A man, she realized. A man was holding her. Not Aeron and not Lysander. Menace poured from this one. Using all the strength she possessed, she struggled for her freedom, scratching at the skin she couldn\u2019t see but could now feel, kicking at the legs resting atop hers.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you,\u201d he said. The voice from the room.</p><p>\u201cWho are you? What do you want with me?\u201d</p><p>They broke through a layer of clouds, hiding them from view. \u201cI\u2019m hurt, truly. I thought my reputation preceded me.\u201d</p><p>Galen, she realized. Aeron\u2019s greatest enemy. He had found the Cloak of Invisibility; Aeron had said as much to Torin. That\u2019s how he\u2019d entered the fortress undetected. That\u2019s how he\u2019d snuck into Aeron\u2019s bedroom.</p><p>That\u2019s how he would ruin what was left of her life.</p><p>Torin didn\u2019t have cameras in the bedrooms, but there were cameras outside them and those would have captured her jumping and flying. Anyone watching the feed would believe she\u2019d simply been heading back to the heavens. Unless Legion told him what had really happened, Aeron would assume Olivia had lied to him. He would think she\u2019d left him without saying goodbye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Blood froze in her veins. She had to convince Galen to take her back. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what you hope to accomplish, but I assure you, you won\u2019t get your wish. Aeron doesn\u2019t care about me.\u201d Not the way she dreamed, hoped. \u201cHe\u2019s letting me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt that, but you weren\u2019t the reason I was in the fortress. You were simply a last resort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you hope to accomplish?\u201d</p> <p>His arms tightened around her. \u201cDo you really think I\u2019ll spill all my secrets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to hurt me? Tell me that, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd spoil the surprise?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cNo. I\u2019d rather show you.\u201d His wings snapped closed, and they began to fall....</p><p>AERON CAME AWAKE with a jolt. One moment he\u2019d been lost to the burning pain working its way through him, flaming his organs to ashes, and the next a cool rain had swept through him. A cool rain he\u2019d instantly recognized. The River of Life. Olivia was here, and she had healed him once again.</p><p>Except, when he focused, he saw that it was Legion who loomed over him, and he fought a wave of disappointment.\u201cIt worked.\u201d She smiled, all pearly whites and happiness. \u201cIt really worked.\u201d</p> <p>Though he badly wanted to ask about his fallen angel, he couldn\u2019t. Not without causing all kinds of problems. \u201cThe others?\u201d His voice was rougher than usual, and not because of damage from the smoke inhalation. The water had healed him. But thoughts of Olivia always filled him with need.</p><p>\u201cWho cares? You know,\u201d Legion added, tracing a finger down the line of his breastbone. Her lashes dipped to half-mast, though he could still see her eyes. They weren\u2019t glazed with desire. No, it was determination that swirled in their depths. \u201cNow that you\u2019re healed, we have some unfinished business to attend to.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her wrist and held her hand at bay. \u201cThe others, Legion? How are they?\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, she waved away his concern. \u201cThey\u2019re still sick. Okay? All right? But they\u2019ll get better on their own. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>Not with those bullets spurting poison into their systems. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me they haven\u2019t been given the River of Life?\u201d Perhaps that\u2019s where Olivia was now, seeing to his friends\u2019 well-being. How like her. Caring, helpful.</p><p>\u201cNo, they weren\u2019t.\u201d There was a growing rigidity to Legion\u2019s features. \u201cNow, about that unfinished business...\u201d</p> <p>Damn her. She was going to make him ask. \u201cDoes Olivia have the vial?\u201d</p><p>Finally giving up her attempts at seduction, Legion looked away from him. At least she hadn\u2019t erupted into a rage because he\u2019d mentioned that\u2014beautiful, perfect\u2014name. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we ran out. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Hardly. Last time he\u2019d used it, there\u2019d been enough to save an entire army. Aeron sat up and scrubbed a hand down his face. So. If Olivia didn\u2019t have the water, that meant Legion did, since it had just been given to him and she was the only one here.</p><p>But why would Legion\u2014 The answer slid into place, and he scowled. Of course. She was saving the rest for him.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I change into something more comfortable,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>Not done with the seduction, after all. He shuddered. \u201cGive me the water, Legion, and stop trying to sleep with me. I know we have to, just not now.\u201d</p><p>Wrath stirred inside his head, stretching and yawning.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLegion. I\u2019m giving up my life to save yours. The least you can do is give me the water.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she crossed her arms over her ample chest. \u201cYou make it sound like I\u2019m...I don\u2019t know, ruining you.\u201d</p><p>He cocked a brow, his silence answer enough, and her anger increased. Any life without Olivia would indeed be a ruined one. Legion\u2019s your bratty kid. \u201cBaby girl\u201d no longer seemed appropriate. You can\u2019t hate her. Fine. \u201cGive me the water or I\u2019ll finally give you the spanking you deserve.\u201d</p><p>Now Wrath purred.</p><p>The demon liked the idea of punishing her? He never had before.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she grumbled, and tugged the vial from between her breasts. \u201cThey only get one drop each. No more.\u201d</p><p>Because no more than a drop would be needed, he said, \u201cI promise,\u201d and grabbed the glowing blue vial, the glass so cold it seemed refrigerated. He pushed to a stand and gazed down at himself. He was still blood-soaked and soot-covered from head to foot. His jeans were ripped and he wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt. Good enough.</p><p>\u201cStay here.\u201d With every step toward the door, his blood flowed faster and his strength intensified.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to look for the angel,\u201d Legion called tightly, \u201cyou should know that she left.\u201d</p><p>The purring faded.</p><p>Aeron stopped and turned. \u201cLeft? As in went to another room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. She left the fortress.\u201d</p><p>No. No. She wouldn\u2019t have done that. She\u2019d promised to stay until he returned and they\u2019d spoken.</p><p>Wrath remained deadly quiet.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me, I see.\u201d Legion sighed and flopped back against the mattress. \u201cShe jumped from the balcony and flew away. She didn\u2019t even tell me to tell you goodbye. Which is rude, if you ask me, but I doubt you will,\u201d she added with a grumble.</p><p>No!</p><p>His own protest echoed the demon\u2019s. He pounded out of the room and down the hall. Legion must have followed him, because she was suddenly beside him, her hand resting in his, trying to drag him to a halt.</p><p>His steps never slowed. \u201cOlivia!\u201d he called.</p><p>Heaven!</p><p>\u201cI told you. She left. She\u2019s gone forever.\u201d</p><p>He jerked free from her hold and his hand curled into fists. Olivia wasn\u2019t a liar. Despite the fact that her voice no longer possessed that ring of truth, she wouldn\u2019t have lied to him. It wasn\u2019t in her nature. He knew that. He knew her. Something must have happened. What, he didn\u2019t know, but he would find out.</p><p>\u201cOlivia!\u201d</p><p>Wrath whimpered.</p><p>We\u2019ll find her. He stopped the first warrior he found\u2014Strider\u2014and tossed the vial of water into his hands, tossing instructions, too, but not slowing in his quest to find his angel.</p><p>\u201cAeron,\u201d Legion said, a desperate quality to the word. \u201cPlease. You were going to lose her anyway. And you better give me back that bottle the moment you\u2019re done, Strider, or I will ensure you never have children!\u201d</p><p>Aeron stormed back into his room and weighed himself down with weapons. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m losing her or not.\u201d Olivia, the one woman he realized he would always chase after, pride and circumstances be damned, was out there. \u201cShe\u2019s mine. Ours,\u201d he added before Wrath could protest. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t rest until she\u2019s returned.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>SLAP. Her lip split.</p><p>Punch. Air abandoned her lungs.Crack. A hard fist slammed into her lower arm, shattering bone.</p><p>Olivia remained mute through it all, enduring, but she couldn\u2019t help the tears that swam in her eyes. The torture had begun an hour ago. An eternity. Her wrists were tied to the arms of a small, wooden chair; she was bruised, bleeding and broken.</p><p>Her hair was soaked from the many times the man called Dean Stefano had held her head underwater, preventing her from breathing, forcing her to suck in mouthful after mouthful of liquid. Now those ice-cold droplets covered her, keeping her awake, ensuring she felt every bit of pain.</p><p>Not as bad as hell, she told herself. You\u2019ll survive. You have to survive.</p><p>\u201cGalen left me in charge of your care,\u201d Stefano said, his face streaked with soot and patches of his skin blistered, \u201cspecifically asking that I interrogate you. And I will. I promise you. Your friends did this to me, you see. They burned me and what had become my home. I barely escaped, and owe them one. Or two.\u201d</p><p>She looked away from his wild eyes. She was in a warehouse of some sort. A warehouse with a concrete floor and metal walls. The room she now occupied was small. There was a table piled high with knives she fully expected the bastard to begin using any moment now. There was a basin of water deep enough to drown her in, which she\u2019d already gotten up close and personal with more times than she could count, and the chair she sat upon.</p><p>\u201cReady to talk now, angel?\u201d How calm he suddenly sounded. Not at all like the cruel man he was.</p><p>If only she\u2019d tell him what he wanted to know, she would be saving the Lords the agony of losing a war, she thought, then bit her tongue. No. No! Galen must be nearby. His demon, Hope, must be playing with her, for that thought had not belonged to her.</p><p>Stay strong.</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is tell me where the Lords have hidden the Cage and this stops.\u201d Stefano offered her a kind smile. \u201cSurely you want that.\u201d</p><p>Did she want it to stop? Yes. Who wouldn\u2019t? But once she told him what he wanted to know, he would kill her. Don\u2019t forget that fact. She pressed her lips into a mulish line.</p><p>He plucked a feather that had fallen to the floor when Galen dumped her here and caressed the tip along her jaw. \u201cThe Cage. Where is it? Tell me. Please. I don\u2019t want to hurt you anymore.\u201d</p><p>You know what you have to do, a voice suddenly growled through her head. Not Lucifer, not Galen. The third that day. This time, she fought back a sob of relief. Lysander. He was here. She couldn\u2019t see him, couldn\u2019t sense him, but she knew he was there.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t alone in this any longer.</p><p>\u201cAngel,\u201d Stefano snapped. Directly in front of her, he curled his hand into a fist, preparing to hit her already-shattered arm. The feather had floated to the floor and now mocked her with its softness. \u201cTalk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t...I don\u2019t know where it is,\u201d she rasped. A lie. She\u2019d never thought she would be grateful for the ability to tell them, but she was now. Of course, that meant the human could choose not to believe her.</p><p>Olivia. Say the words, and I\u2019ll take you home.</p><p>Oh, she knew she could leave. Knew she could return to the heavens as planned and escape this. All of it. The pain, the humiliation. But she\u2019d made a promise to Aeron, and it was a promise she intended to keep. She had to tell him goodbye. She would tell him goodbye. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou do know,\u201d Stefano said. \u201cYou traipsed that fortress for weeks without anyone knowing you were there.

I can\u2019t help you any more until you do.</p><p>\u201cYour wife...would not have...wanted this.\u201d This time she was speaking to Stefano and ignoring Lysander. She was glad he was here, yes, but she wouldn\u2019t cave in this matter.</p><p>Through her spying, Olivia knew that Darla, the wife in question, had committed suicide. Because of Sabin, keeper of Doubt, and Stefano\u2014the two men who had loved her. She\u2019d been locked in a tug-of-war between them, death her only escape.</p><p>Stefano\u2019s eyes narrowed, shielding the darkness of his irises. \u201cShe was tricked. The demons tricked her into liking them.\u201d He leaned down, flattening his palms on her bound arms\u2014on her broken bone\u2014and pressed. \u201cIf she\u2019d been in her right mind, she would\u2019ve wanted me to do more.\u201d</p><p>Another cry escaped her. The pain was so sharp, it traveled through her entire body before collecting in her stomach and burning.</p><p>Olivia!</p> <p>\u201cAeron will hate me more than ever, as well, when I send him one of your fingers,\u201d Stefano said, as calm as when he\u2019d caressed her with that feather. \u201cThen he\u2019ll come for you. He\u2019ll end up dying for you. Is that a price you\u2019re willing to pay? Tell me where the Cage is, and I\u2019ll spare his life.\u201d</p><p>There it was again. That hope for a better future. If she told Stefano what he wanted to know, she would go free, return to Aeron, and they could be together forever. They could make love again, and even start a family.</p><p>Did Galen know what his man was doing in a bid for the answers he sought? Did he care? Did he realize what his nearness was doing to her?</p><p>Olivia, damn you. You don\u2019t have to tell him and you don\u2019t have to endure. Just come home.</p><p>In and out she breathed. Fighting herself, her desires. Fighting that silly hope. Fighting the pain. She opened her mouth. What she planned to say, she might never know. Stefano hit her and she couldn\u2019t form a single word...was fading...sinking...blessedly lost...</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S GOING TO TAKE A WHILE and could yield no results.\u201d</p><p>Aeron studied his friend, barely able to stop himself from latching onto those massive shoulders and shaking. Lucien\u2019s mismatched eyes, one brown, one blue, were regarding him with grim resolve. \u201cI don\u2019t care how long it takes. Just do it.\u201dHe wanted to shake himself for not thinking of this sooner.</p><p>Everyone here thought that Olivia had returned to the heavens, as Legion had claimed. Hell, they\u2019d all watched the video Torin\u2019s camera had recorded. The one of her jumping from the balcony in his bedroom.</p> <p>The scene played through his mind constantly. She\u2019d been standing inside his room, staring out at the night. She\u2019d stiffened, turned. Then she\u2019d turned again, walking outside, her mouth moving as if she were talking to someone\u2014Legion said she\u2019d been mumbling about her excitement to rejoin her friends\u2014but it had been terror that had bled from her expression. Then she\u2019d leapt. Fallen, fallen, begun to soar. Without her wings.</p><p>How could she have flown without her wings? Why had she been afraid?</p><p>The others assumed that terror stemmed from the unknown, of wondering how the angels would receive her. Aeron knew better. Olivia wouldn\u2019t fear that. She\u2019d told him the angels were forgiving\u2014patient, had been her word\u2014and that they would welcome her with open arms.</p><p>The only rational conclusion was that Legion was lying. Again. Which meant Olivia had been taken, as he\u2019d first assumed. And there was only one way that could\u2019ve happened. Galen. Galen had used the Cloak of Invisibility.</p><p>Save her. Punish him.</p><p>That the demon wished to save first and punish second proved the depths of his affection.</p><p>Aeron had scoured the entire city of Buda. He had raided buildings, terrorized citizens and killed. Oh, had he killed, and happily, too, no trace of guilt, having discovered many Hunters still lingering nearby. He might never be able to remove the blood from his hands. But there\u2019d been no sign of Olivia. No hint of her scent. No rumors, no sightings. He. Was. Desperate. And only growing more so.</p><p>\u201cCome. There\u2019s no better time to begin.\u201d He led Lucien down the hallway to his bedroom, where he threw open the door.</p><p>Legion, who was once again lounging on the bed, sat up. The sheet fell to her waist, revealing bare breasts. \u201cFinally. Are you ready to do this or what?\u201d</p><p>He ignored her\u2014as he had since tossing that vial at Strider\u2014so angry with her he no longer knew how to treat her, and stepped aside, allowing Lucien deeper inside the room.</p><p>Legion released a frustrated sigh. \u201cCompany? Now?\u201d</p><p>Wrath hissed at her.</p><p>Aeron sensed that the demon liked her still, as he did, despite his rage, because there were no urges to hurt her. But no longer was Wrath calmed by her. She\u2019d destroyed their piece of \u201cheaven,\u201d and neither of them could forget.</p><p>Lucien was careful not to glance toward the bed. He stopped in the center of the room and spun slowly. He was here to lock on to Olivia\u2019s spirit trail\u2014a trail he could then follow to wherever she was being held. Aeron\u2019s hands fisted.</p><p>\u201cGods,\u201d Lucien said, the awe in his tone clear. \u201cShe has the purest spirit I\u2019ve ever beheld.\u201d</p><p>Aeron couldn\u2019t see it, but he could feel it, and nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Legion asked with a pout.</p><p>Again, he ignored her. Six days left until he had to be with her, but just then he wasn\u2019t sure he could do it, even to save his friends.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow it as far as it goes,\u201d Lucien told him, \u201cand if I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you,\u201d Aeron corrected, a low growl forming in his throat. She is fine. She has to be fine.</p><p>The warrior nodded. \u201cWhen I find her, I\u2019ll come back for you.\u201d With that, Lucien disappeared into the spirit realm to follow that trail.</p><p>Gods, he felt helpless. He wanted\u2014needed\u2014to be out there, actively looking for her himself. But his first attempt had wielded no results, and deep down he knew his second wouldn\u2019t, either. Galen could have taken her anywhere, and Lucien would reach her much faster. If Aeron left the fortress now, Lucien would then have to hunt him down, once the warrior discovered her location.</p><p>\u201cAeron!\u201d Legion jumped to her feet, scowling over at him as she clutched the sheet around her. \u201cThis is about the angel, I take it. Well, she\u2019s gone. Let her stay gone. We\u2019re better off. Why can\u2019t you see that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t better off without her,\u201d he shouted, no longer able to temper his ferocity. He faced her, pinning her with the fierceness of his stare. Why couldn\u2019t she see how much he needed Olivia? \u201cShe\u2019s better than any of us.\u201d</p><p>Disbelief glimmered in her eyes like tears. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe her, but she was right. You...you love her.\u201d</p><p>Aeron didn\u2019t allow himself the luxury of answering. If he admitted, even to himself, that he loved Olivia, he wouldn\u2019t be able to let her go when the time came. He would keep her, no matter the consequences. \u201cTell me what happened when she left. Tell me the truth, damn you!\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth. To lie. He knew it; Wrath sensed it. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d With anyone else, the demon would have plagued him with an urge to lie in return. Legion\u2019s sins had never bothered Wrath before, hadn\u2019t even registered, but as pissed as they were with her, things were changing. \u201cThe truth, godsdamn it. Only the truth. After everything I\u2019ve done for you, do I deserve anything less?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you\u2019re right. I\u2014I\u2019m sorry. I just thought...I thought it\u2019d be easier for you if you thought she was...willing to leave you.\u201d</p><p>No. Fuck, no. A raw cry from him, from Wrath. \u201cSo Galen...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas her. Yes. I\u2019m sorry, Aeron. So sorry.\u201d</p><p>Having his suspicions confirmed...well, he might as well have cut the heart from his chest and torched it. His beautiful Olivia was indeed with his enemy, probably hurting unbearably, for mercy was not something Galen\u2019s army practiced.</p><p>He tilted back his head and roared.</p><p>\u201cAeron. Tell me what I can do to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d As he glared over at her, he bit the inside of his cheek until he tasted blood. \u201cYou\u2019ve hurt a woman who gave up her life to save us. Us. Not just me, but you. She\u2019s the reason you\u2019re still here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Legion repeated raggedly, pulling from his gaze and peering down at the floor. \u201cI really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d That didn\u2019t bring Olivia back.</p><p>Punish.</p><p>Wrath\u2019s demand, tossed out so determinedly, threw him. Even though the demon had been edging in that direction already.</p><p>She betrayed us.</p><p>Careful. Wouldn\u2019t you rather save Olivia? Aeron asked.</p><p>Anger morphed into sorrow. Heaven.</p><p>He\u2019d take that as a yes. Pushing Legion from his mind, Aeron stalked to the closet and began to prepare for Lucien\u2019s return, strapping on as many knives and guns as his body could hold.</p><p>Just in case, he also grabbed what remained of the River of Life. Half the bottle. Strider hadn\u2019t heeded his instructions all that well, but a little was better than none. Hopefully, Olivia wouldn\u2019t need any. But if Galen had hurt her, there wasn\u2019t a hole the bastard would be able to hide in or a piece of fabric he\u2019d be able to shield himself with. In the end, Aeron would find him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vengeance.</p><p>Yes. Vengeance would be his.</p><p>WHAT HAVE I DONE? Legion thought, horrified, as Aeron stalked out of the chamber he\u2019d decorated to amuse her. He was suffering. And she was the cause. He was right. He\u2019d only ever treated her with kindness, and she\u2019d reduced him to this. His eyes were bleak, his voice ripe with despair.</p> <p>Her stomach churned with sickness. She would have done anything, anything, to make this better for him. Maybe...maybe even step aside so that he could be with Olivia again. No. Don\u2019t think like that. Because she\u2019d made that wretched bargain with Lucifer, her course was set\u2014and so was Aeron\u2019s.There had to be something else she could do, though. Something that would make him happy again. Something like...</p><p>The answer hit her, and she closed her eyes. No, no, no, she thought. Then, Only way.</p><p>For Aeron.</p><p>With shaky hands, she tugged on her clothes. A pair of pants and a T-shirt she\u2019d borrowed from Danika. She could get the angel back. Not for Aeron to be with, but so that he could finally tell her goodbye. Legion couldn\u2019t follow spirit trails like Lucien, but she could sense her brethren. That\u2019s how she\u2019d found Aeron the day they\u2019d first met. She\u2019d sensed his demon nearby. She could sense Galen, as well.</p><p>I should never have let him leave with the angel. Despite the Cloak hiding him, she\u2019d known the moment he stepped into this room. She\u2019d said nothing, too busy hoping he\u2019d destroy her competition. I\u2019m a bad, bad girl.</p> <p>Find him. Yes. Okay. That\u2019s what she\u2019d do. She\u2019d present Aeron with both Olivia and Galen. And then Aeron would love her again.</p><p>\u201cLEAVE ME ALONE, child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a child.\u201d Gilly placed her hands on her hips, the picture of feminine pique. Too-young feminine pique. \u201cYou need someone to care for your wounds.\u201d\u201cMy wounds,\u201d William told her with a frown, \u201care healing just fine.\u201d Since the moment he\u2019d returned to the fortress, riddled with slices, she\u2019d been fussing over him.</p><p>Yeah, he liked it. What man wouldn\u2019t enjoy being cared for? But the fact that he had to keep reminding himself that Gilly was too young for him was freaking him out. He shouldn\u2019t have to remind himself that he preferred older, more sophisticated women.</p><p>He shouldn\u2019t have to remind himself that he even preferred married women. Gods, did he love married women. The brokenhearted, too. They were easy pickings. Actually, anyone with low self-esteem was an aphrodisiac to him. He seriously jonesed, watching them bloom under his flattery. But adorable little Gilly?</p><p>No. No, no, no. Off-limits. Always. No matter her age. With all the women he\u2019d been with\u2014and yes, there\u2019d been thousands\u2014he knew you didn\u2019t play with the toys in your own home. That left too big a mess. You played with other people\u2019s toys in their homes.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you being this way?\u201d She tucked a dark strand of hair behind her ears. A delicate ear. An ear made for nuzzling.</p><p>Idiot! \u201cGet out,\u201d he said more harshly than he\u2019d intended.</p><p>She flinched, and then a blanket of hurt fell over her lovely features. \u201cAnd go where? The other girls are with their boyfriends, and I don\u2019t like hanging out with the single men.\u201d</p><p>Uh, hello. \u201cI\u2019m single.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you\u2019re not like them,\u201d she said, gazing down at her shoes.</p><p>That was true. He was way more handsome and intelligent. Probably a little more deadly, too. \u201cGilly,\u201d he said on a sigh. \u201cI think it\u2019s time we had a chat. I\u2019ve sensed that you have some...feelings for me. I don\u2019t blame you. Hell, I commend you for your intelligence and keen appreciation of beauty. But we\u2019re friends, you and I, and that\u2019s all we can ever be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Those big eyes with their too-long lashes flicked up, pinning him in place, giving him ideas he shouldn\u2019t be having. Like teaching her that pleasure didn\u2019t have to be ugly.</p><p>You\u2019re worse than an idiot. He made sure to moderate his tone. \u201cBecause you\u2019re too young to be with a man and understand what that means.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed bitterly. \u201cI\u2019ve known for years what that means.\u201d</p><p>There it was again, a verbal confirmation that things had been done to her. Things that should never have been done. \u201cWhoever was with you was wrong,\u201d he said tightly. \u201cVery, very wrong.\u201d</p><p>A blush bloomed in her cheeks, and he wasn\u2019t sure if the color was born of shame, embarrassment or relief that someone recognized the ill-treatment she\u2019d received. She didn\u2019t know that he knew about the stepfather, and he wasn\u2019t going to tell her; she only knew that William blamed the one who had hurt her, not Gilly herself.</p><p>Which was true. Her stepfather should be shot. And gutted. And then hung. And then set on fire. And William would see to it. In fact, that would be his next mission. Her mother wouldn\u2019t fare very well, either.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be wrong with you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Gods, she was killing him. \u201cWhy do you want to hang around me, anyway?\u201d He wouldn\u2019t tell her what he planned. She might try and stop him. \u201cWhat makes me different from the others?\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips, the pink tip of her tongue hiding away before he\u2019d gotten a good enough look at it. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t smoke.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what she found appealing? \u201cNeither do the other men here. But unlike them, I\u2019ve been meaning to take up the habit.\u201d And would do so, immediately. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t be using a filter!\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest and drummed her nails. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that. You\u2019re beautiful, as you\u2019ve already told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs always, there\u2019s no denying that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cModest, too,\u201d she added dryly.</p><p>He was what he was. He knew his appeal, and wasn\u2019t ashamed to admit it. \u201cLooks aren\u2019t everything, though. Especially since I\u2019m as shallow as a rain puddle. I use women, Gilly. I sleep with them and then I\u2019m done with them, even if they want more from me.\u201d He hated to taint her illusions about him, but it had to be done. One of them had to be smart about this.</p><p>She shifted from one foot to the other, once again looking away from him. \u201cI knew all of that. I\u2019ve heard talk about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom who?\u201d Whoever gossiped about him needed to be\u2014</p><p>\u201cAnya.\u201d</p><p>Spanked. Hard. \u201cWhatever she told you, just remember that she\u2019s a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said you can make a woman forget her troubles. So much so that the woman is happier when you leave her than she was when you found her, no matter the broken heart you leave behind.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cWell, for once she spoke true.\u201d His touch was magical. \u201cBut listen. In a few years, the right man is going to come along and make you happier.\u201d Sure, that man would have to meet William\u2019s standards and gain his approval, but they would jump that hurdle when they came to it. \u201cAs for me, I\u2019m not that man. I\u2019m not right for anyone long-term.\u201d</p><p>Again, hurt fell over her face. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We aren\u2019t going to happen, Gilly. Not now, not ever.\u201d</p><p>She gulped, visibly gathering her composure. \u201cFine,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone. As you prefer.\u201d True to her word, she stalked from his bedroom, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>Unfortunately, she left the sweet scent of vanilla in her wake, taunting his bastard of a nose.</p><p>William pushed to his feet. His sides hurt, the wounds still in the process of scabbing over, but he had to get out of here before he followed her. The more distance between himself and Gilly the better. Besides, he had cigarettes to buy.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d help Aeron find his angel\u2014who cared if she was findable or not\u2014and then, when he was at full capacity, he would track and kill Gilly\u2019s family.</p><p>A good plan, if he did say so himself, but why did he suddenly feel so...incomplete?</p><p>A WIFE, GIDEON THOUGHT, dazed. He\u2019d had a wife. A wife he didn\u2019t remember. How was that possible?</p><p>After Scarlet\u2019s announcement, he\u2019d just sort of stumbled from the dungeon. He hadn\u2019t known what to say to her. Hadn\u2019t known whether he could believe her, Lies absolutely no fucking help. All he\u2019d known was that he hadn\u2019t wanted to leave her, but he\u2019d promised to do so, so he had.Except, he\u2019d stayed nearby, in the stairwell. Waiting, thinking, floundering, hoping she would call for him. She hadn\u2019t. Now, hours later, she was sleeping and he was headed...somewhere. He gazed up, meaning to keep track of his surroundings, when he bumped into an equally distracted Strider.</p><p>\u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, my man,\u201d his friend said with a grin. \u201cAnd shouldn\u2019t you be in your room?\u201d</p><p>He had his shoulder propped against the wall for support, was panting and sweating. He hadn\u2019t eaten in forever, and was weakening by the second. \u201cProbably not. No help needed.\u201d</p><p>Concern chased away Strider\u2019s smile. \u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>A strong arm clasped his waist and Gideon shifted his weight. \u201cNo thanks, enemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Along the way, Strider told him about the bombing of The Asylum, and their victory. That explained the happy glow in the warrior\u2019s eyes. But there was something else in his eyes. Something out of place. Something...dark, upsetting.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not great, but what about what\u2019s not troubling you?\u201d</p><p>Strider looked over his shoulder, then scanned the hallway, ensuring they were alone. They were. Even so, he remained silent until he got Gideon inside his room and situated atop his mattress.</p><p>He sat on the chair Ashlyn\u2014and then sweet Olivia\u2014had once occupied, propped his elbows on his knees and leaned forward, head dropping into his upraised hands. \u201cSo get this. We met the Unspoken Ones. They\u2019re bad, dude. Bad. They know where the fourth artifact is, and they\u2019re willing to give it to whoever brings them Cronus\u2019s head. Even the Hunters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we won\u2019t. You remember the painting Danika made of Galen?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shit. Yeah, he remembered. In it, Galen had taken Cronus\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cIf that comes true,\u201d Strider continued, \u201cthe Unspoken Ones, who are extremely powerful, will be freed from Cronus\u2019s rule, and they\u2019ll be able to do whatever they want. Like, I don\u2019t know, eat every human on the planet. I noticed they prefer an organ-rich diet.\u201d</p><p>Shit didn\u2019t cover it. \u201cThat\u2019s awesome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI summoned Cronus, hoping to talk to him about this, to see if there was any way we could destroy the Unspoken Ones before Galen got creative with his blade, but he\u2019s ignoring me. Torin summoned him, too. Nothing. And get this. I just ran into Danika. She\u2019d just finished her newest painting.\u201d</p><p>Dread curled through Gideon. Usually, Strider relished an upcoming challenge. Now he just looked sickened. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might change your mind when you hear this. It was of Cronus and his wife, Rhea. Oh, yeah. Did anyone tell you Rhea is helping the Hunters? Anyway, they were with Lysander, Cronus fuming and Rhea cheering. You know Lysander, right? He\u2019s the angel shacking up with Bianka.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yes.</p><p>\u201cNo biggie, right?\u201d Strider said. \u201cSo what if Cronus is pissed at Lysander and Rhea is pleased with him. The angel doesn\u2019t really concern us. Well, your demon will really dig this. That\u2019s a lie. The angel concerns us big-time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t go on, then. Don\u2019t hurry with the details. I mean, I love that you\u2019re dragging this out.\u201d Which he was probably doing because he didn\u2019t want to drop the bad news at all and was having to work up the courage. Still. Gideon couldn\u2019t take much more.</p><p>Strider looked up, expression grim. \u201cAeron was there, in the painting. Lysander had just taken his head.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>IT WAS THE PAIN that woke her.</p><p>Olivia slowly cracked open her eyes. Beep, beep. At first, the room was hazy, as if someone had smeared it with oil. But then, bit by bit, clarity descended. Not full clarity\u2014her eyes were swollen\u2014but enough to see that she was still in the warehouse, though in another room. This one had hospital gurneys. She was hooked to an IV, and electrodes covered her chest, monitoring her heartbeat. Her broken arm wasn\u2019t in a cast, she noted, but was cuffed to the bedrail.\u201cLysander?\u201d Even speaking those few syllables caused her throat nothing but agony. Tears flooded her ravaged eyes.</p><p>There was no reply.</p> <p>She tried again. \u201cLysander.\u201d</p><p>Again, nothing.</p><p>He was gone, then. He wouldn\u2019t have ignored her, that wasn\u2019t his style. He would have yelled at her some more and right now, that yelling would have been welcome. She was alone and scared.</p><p>No, not alone, she realized as her gaze scanned the rest of the room. Beside her was a man on a gurney of his own. A man she didn\u2019t recognize. He was young, perhaps early twenties, and there were bruises under his eyes. His cheeks were hollowed out and his skin a little jaundiced.</p><p>He was watching her.</p><p>When he realized he\u2019d been found out, he blushed and said, \u201cUh, hi. Glad to see you\u2019re awake. My name\u2019s Dominic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d she replied automatically. Ow. That had hurt even worse.</p><p>\u201cYou sound terrible.\u201d Remorse and guilt poured from him. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be the good guys, you know. Stefano told me you\u2019re Wrath\u2019s girlfriend, but I don\u2019t care. You shouldn\u2019t have been hurt like that. No human should be hurt like that.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t have to ask who \u201cwe\u201d was. The Hunters. Her gaze shifted over the boy\u2019s body, checking for injuries. He was shirtless and there were bandages around his shoulder and middle. The one around his middle was dotted with dried blood. He wore a pair of loose scrub pants. \u201cHurt...you, too?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to hear her, too lost in his own thoughts. \u201cThey told me our leader is a demon, too.\u201d As the last word left him, he began coughing. Coughing so forcefully, he spit up blood. When he finally calmed, he added, \u201cI should have believed them. After what was done to you, I have to believe them.\u201d</p><p>Them. The Lords? She couldn\u2019t sense a lie in his tone, but then, she couldn\u2019t sense the truth, either. Either way, she knew deep in her bones that he wasn\u2019t going to live much longer. She hated that he would die like this, in here. As she probably would.</p><p>No. No. She shouldn\u2019t think like that. She was a joy-bringer at heart, yes, but that didn\u2019t mean she was helpless. She\u2019d withstood the fires of hell. She\u2019d endured having her wings ripped from her body. She could escape this. She would escape this.</p><p>Dominic sat up, wavered a bit and rubbed at his temples. When he steadied, he kicked his legs over the side of the gurney and stood.</p><p>\u201cCareful,\u201d she managed to croak.</p><p>Again, he didn\u2019t seem to hear her. \u201cThey found me on the streets. I was a thief and a whore, and they told me it wasn\u2019t my fault.\u201d There was shame in his voice, shame far greater than his remorse had been. \u201cThey told me it was their fault. The Lords. That the demon of Defeat was feeding off me and my circumstances. I believed them because it was easier than blaming myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLied,\u201d she said. He was making a last confession, and that nearly made her sob. Death shouldn\u2019t bother her. It never had before. But now she knew the finality of it. This kid, for that\u2019s what he was, should have had a chance to live a long and happy life. Instead, he\u2019d known only sorrow and regret.</p><p>One wobbly step, two, he worked his way around his gurney, approaching hers. \u201cI know they lied. Now. The Lords, they sent me back. Set me free. They didn\u2019t want to, but they did it. Defeat did it, and there was compassion in his eyes. I saw it. Evil doesn\u2019t feel compassion, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI studied him, you know? More than the others. I wanted to kill him myself, but he saved me. And Stefano, what he did to you...\u201d Dominic shook his head, scowled. \u201cThere\u2019s no compassion in the act of beating a defenseless woman. Galen was pissed when he found out, but the angel didn\u2019t punish Stefano for his actions.\u201d</p><p>Galen, upset at her mistreatment? Surprising.</p><p>When Dominic finally reached her, he offered her a small smile that managed to be sad and happy at the same time. \u201cThose bastards never thought I\u2019d help you.\u201d He pulled one of the ties from his pants and there at the end hung a thin strip of metal. \u201cThey were wrong. Over the years, I learned to always be prepared for anything.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise as he worked at the cuff holding her captive. They teared again, as well. The pain was unbearable, nearly sending her back into that welcome black void. Thankfully, the metal clicked before she fell, freeing her, easing the agony somewhat.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ten minutes. Maybe. Someone\u2019s always coming in here to check on you.\u201d As he spoke, he helped her sit up. \u201cPlus, I was supposed to call Galen when you woke up. Of course, I won\u2019t do that.\u201d With barely a pause, he added, \u201cAt the door, we\u2019re going to turn left. We\u2019ll walk past all the other doorways, and hopefully my body will block yours. There are men here, only a few, but even though they\u2019re the medical staff, they won\u2019t hesitate to gun you down if they realize who you are and that you\u2019re free.\u201d</p><p>Uncertain, Olivia placed her weight on her left foot, then her right. They held. A sigh of relief parted her lips\u2014and made her cringe. Her lips were cut and the action, small as it had been, split the abrasions apart.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave without the Cloak,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible. Galen keeps it with him at all times. The only way to get it is to confront him, and you won\u2019t survive if you do that.\u201d</p><p>Dominic was right. She didn\u2019t have the strength to defeat Galen. But she couldn\u2019t leave that Cloak in his possession. Someone else could be taken by him. And would be. Galen wouldn\u2019t hesitate, and he might not be so...lenient with the next person.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Dominic said, and with his arm around her waist, he led her toward the only door.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Galen now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I know what you\u2019re thinking, but I already told you. We can\u2019t do it. There\u2019s just no way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to try,\u201d she said, letting her determination seep from her.</p><p>He stilled, closed his eyes. She could feel his heart banging against his ribs, erratic, too hard. \u201cHe\u2019s here. Waiting. Impatient.\u201d He laughed bitterly. \u201cI tried to wake you sooner, but you were pretty out of it.\u201d</p><p>If she left, Galen would leave this warehouse and never return to it, knowing she could bring the Lords here. She\u2019d no longer know where to find him, and that was an edge she wouldn\u2019t give up.</p><p>\u201cI want you to go on without me,\u201d she said. She spouted off directions to the fortress. \u201cThe Lords will spot you once you reach the hill. Ask for Aeron and tell him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dominic shook his head. \u201cHow many times do I have to tell you? You can\u2019t beat Galen. He\u2019ll kill you before he parts with that Cloak. I\u2019m dying, anyway, and don\u2019t care if I do so here or somewhere else. But you...No,\u201d he said again. \u201cI won\u2019t let you. I won\u2019t die knowing I did nothing to help you.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to protest, to tell him anything needed to convince him to do as she wanted, but the sound of pounding footsteps and a distant shout stopped her.</p><p>Dominic stiffened. \u201cHe\u2019s coming back to check on you,\u201d he whispered, horrified. \u201cShit. Shit.\u201d He dragged her to the door and pressed her against the wall next to it, where they would be hidden when that door opened.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave without the Cloak. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Again Dominic closed his eyes, as if he were weighing his options. Only took a second, a second that seemed to drag into eternity, but when he opened them, there was more resolve banked in his expression than she\u2019d ever seen in anyone before. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe Cloak will be in his pocket. As it folds, it shrinks. It\u2019s gray, soft. Grab it and run. Don\u2019t look back. Just run. Okay?\u201d</p><p>Like his, her heart was pounding against her ribs. Sweat was beading over her skin, her limbs were shaking and her mouth drying. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d He claimed he was ready to die, but she wasn\u2019t ready to watch him do so. He was a nice kid who\u2019d seen too many bad things in his short life. He deserved a happily ever after.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle Galen. Okay?\u201d He pulled the other tie from his scrubs and there was a blade attached. His knuckles whitened as he clutched the hilt. \u201cJust reach into his pockets, grab whatever you can and run.\u201d</p><p>Pockets. Galen wore a robe just like Olivia\u2019s, so she knew that there were three pockets. Two on the right and one on the left. It would be impossible to frisk all three at the same time. Still, she said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and prayed she chose correctly.</p> <p>The door swung open, and Galen strode inside. He stopped in the center of the room, head swinging left and right to survey the empty gurneys. She didn\u2019t think about her next actions, just propelled into him and slid her hands along his sides, into two of his pockets.</p><p>He cursed and tried to push her away. Perhaps Lysander was helping her, after all, because Galen did not succeed.</p><p>Her broken arm throbbed, the fingers swollen and slow to react to mental commands, but she grabbed everything she touched, turned and ran. Just ran. Just as Dominic had wanted. Fingers snagged in her hair and jerked, but she kept moving.</p><p>She passed the door, halfway expecting hard hands to settle on her shoulders or tangle in her hair again, but that never happened. Instead, she heard a shout, a roar of pain, and knew Dominic had just stabbed Galen.</p><p>A stabbing wouldn\u2019t keep the immortal down for long.</p> <p>Through the open doorways of the other rooms, several men raced into the hallway. As their confused, panicked gazes hit her, she increased her speed and peered down at her bounty. There, in the center of her palm, was a square of gray material.</p><p>Relief. Excitement. Yes, she experienced both. They gave her strength. Olivia dropped everything else, it wasn\u2019t important right now, and shook the material out. Because of her inattention, she plowed into a solid wall of man.</p><p>The action jarred her, hurt her, but not enough to stop her from continuing to shake out the material as she fell. Just as the man bent down to grab her, she wrapped the Cloak around her shoulders.</p><p>One minute she could see her limbs, the next she couldn\u2019t. Don\u2019t even breathe. Be quiet.</p><p>All of the men spun, frowning, looking for her. They fired at where she\u2019d been, but she\u2019d already moved. She pressed against the wall, and they finally darted past her, shouting for help.</p><p>Galen stomped out of the room, blood spurting from his gut. He was scowling and dragging an unconscious\u2014please, let him be alive\u2014Dominic behind him.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019d she go?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just disappeared.\u201d</p><p>Galen ran his tongue over his teeth. He dropped Dominic, who didn\u2019t even utter a gasp. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t have gotten far. She\u2019s injured. Spread out and move toward the demons\u2019 lair. That\u2019s where she\u2019s headed. If you feel anything you can\u2019t see, shoot. If you hear a woman panting but can\u2019t see her, shoot. Do you understand? I\u2019m done playing nice. She has something that belongs to me. Do not set foot on the hill, though. The Lords will see you, and I\u2019m not ready for that yet.\u201d</p><p>A chorus of yeses rang out, and the men were off.</p><p>Galen stood there for a long while, popping his jaw, breathing deeply. Olivia didn\u2019t dare risk an exhalation; she simply held the oxygen in her nose and waited. Finally, he stormed off, following behind the men.</p><p>She tiptoed forward and placed her fingers at Dominic\u2019s neck. No pulse. Her chin trembled, and tears once again filled her eyes. He\u2019d been ready to die, had wanted it even, but it still broke her heart. He\u2019d never known joy. He should have known joy.</p><p>Pray for his soul. Later. You can\u2019t help anyone if you die, as well. Olivia stood, her tears pouring down her cheeks like rain. She could barely see in front of her, but she stumbled forward, taking the same path as Galen.</p> <p>The hallway led to an empty area, but that empty area led to a closed doorway. The exit? Most likely. The seam between the double doors revealed a stream of sunlight.</p><p>Gulping, she held out her uninjured hand and pushed the panels open. Warm air instantly enveloped her. And sure enough, the sun was shining brightly over a parking lot. Too brightly for her now-sensitive vision. Still, she blinked against those rays as she trudged onward.</p><p>Until a smiling Galen stepped into her path.</p><p>His wings were spread wide, and she was moving too quickly to stop. She knocked into him and careened backward, falling into the metal wall of the warehouse. With a shocked, pained gasp, she slid to the rock-laden ground.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d stay behind to check on the boy,\u201d he said, grin widening. \u201cYour friends caused his death, yet still you thought to return to them. So disappointing. So predictable.\u201d</p><p>Bastard!</p><p>He lunged for the wall, and Olivia rolled out of the way, clutching as many rocks as she could hold. She scrambled to her feet, careful not to make another sound, and Galen ended up slamming into the building.</p><p>He straightened. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. I can see your footprints. It\u2019s just a matter of following you now.\u201d</p><p>Thanks for the warning. She zigzagged left, right, gaze continually moving, searching for a path to safety. Only dirt and gravel greeted her. Which meant anywhere she stepped, he would continue to see her prints. And he did. He followed her.</p><p>\u201cEscape me, and I\u2019ll go after Aeron next. I\u2019ll cut off his head while you watch, helpless.\u201d</p><p>He was taunting her, trying to trick her into retreating.</p><p>Slowly, inch by agonizing inch, Olivia moved backward. Still Galen followed. She threw a glance over her shoulder. A hundred yards away was a busy area, with a high-traffic road and many other buildings. Hunters had probably chosen the location as a way of hiding in plain sight, but what they hadn\u2019t counted on was that it would be easier for their prisoners to hide, as well. All she had to do was make it there, and then she would be safe. He would never be able to pick her out.</p><p>Problem: he was fast, faster than her, and uninjured. If she ran, he could catch her. Worth the risk.</p><p>Drawing on a reservoir of strength she hadn\u2019t known she possessed, she spun around and sprinted forward. There was a crunch of gravel, and she knew that Galen was still hot on her trail. Her entire body screamed in protest each time she threw one leg in front of the other, but she only increased her speed.</p><p>Almost there... Galen gripped the Cloak and jerked. Yelping, fisting the material with her free hand to keep it around her, she rounded a corner and slammed into a group of pedestrians. Two fell backward as her shoulder and arm were revealed. Panting, Olivia refit the material around her, then plastered herself against the nearest wall.</p><p>She tossed her handful of rocks into a pole. Pop, pop, pop. She watched, hopeful, as Galen soared past her toward the pole, giving chase to where he thought she\u2019d gone.</p><p>So close. So close to disaster. But she\u2019d done it. She\u2019d really done it.</p><p>Hot breath slammed in and out of her nose, burning her throat and lungs. Sweat was pouring obscenely now, and she probably smelled. Her limbs were once more shaking. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t go to the fortress. Galen\u2019s men would be surrounding the place by the time she reached it. She couldn\u2019t call Aeron for a pickup because she didn\u2019t know his number.</p><p>She had to do something, go somewhere; she couldn\u2019t stay here. Using the wall to prop herself up, she careened forward, winding around several corners, letting herself become lost in the different crowds and locations. Finally, she spied a shadowed, empty alley and sat. Mistake. The moment her body stilled, she knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to force it into action again. Her muscles clamped down on her bones, and every spark of energy drained.</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d she whispered. Waited.</p><p>Once again, she received no reply.</p><p>Alone. A terrible thought. This wasn\u2019t the best location to hide. Someone could stumble over her invisible legs. More than that, Hunters would probably be searching all the alleys when she failed to reach the fortress. But...</p><p>She\u2019d rest her eyes, she thought. Just for a bit. Catch her breath, too. Then she\u2019d pick herself up and start moving again. Except, she must have fallen asleep, because when she finally opened her eyes, still unable to move, she saw that the sun had set and the moon was glowing prettily.</p><p>Her pain was magnified, her resolve finally shaken. She couldn\u2019t do this. She couldn\u2019t go on. Death would be welcome. She wouldn\u2019t fight. She would\u2014</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d a male voice said, startling her. \u201cCome on, sweetheart. I know you\u2019re here. Your spirit trail ends here, but I can\u2019t see you.\u201d A second later, a body materialized.</p><p>Lucien. She recognized him, though they\u2019d never been properly introduced, and knew he carried the demon of Death. How appropriate. He could escort her\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you. I want to help you. Aeron\u2019s looking for you.\u201d</p><p>Aeron. Death could suck it. With a shaky hand that felt as if boulders anchored it in place, she reached up and tugged the Cloak from her shoulders. \u201cH-here. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Lucien\u2019s eyes widened when she suddenly appeared. \u201cOh, sweetheart. I\u2019m so sorry. Everything will be\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo time to explain what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s a soul at the warehouse where you were tortured, and I need to escort him into the hereafter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis name\u2019s Dominic,\u201d she said in that savaged voice of hers. \u201cHe saved me. Be gentle with him, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Lucien disappeared.</p><p>She folded the Cloak as best she could, expecting\u2014Lucien reappeared with Aeron.</p><p>All other thoughts faded. Aeron. Unexpected. Welcome. \u201cI thought you were...the soul...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m doing next. See you back at the fortress,\u201d Lucien said, and once again disappeared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, baby,\u201d Aeron said gently as he crouched beside her. Despite the gentleness, she could hear his worry and his fury. But he was here, he was safe after the earlier battle. \u201cWhat did they do to you?\u201d</p><p>Like Lucien, she didn\u2019t have time for explanations. \u201cThey\u2019re out here, looking for me. Waiting by the fortress.\u201d</p><p>He immediately stiffened, his gaze sweeping the area. \u201cNo one\u2019s near us. You\u2019re safe. And I\u2019ll call Torin and warn him about what\u2019s going on. Anyone in the area will be taken care of before we get there.\u201d With a tender expression, he withdrew a vial from his pocket and held it to her lips. \u201cDrink, baby, drink.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. There was no need to waste a drop on her. She\u2019d be going home soon and\u2014</p><p>Determined, he parted her lips himself and tipped the glass. The cool liquid slid down her throat, more than a sip, and settled wonderfully in her stomach. Within seconds, that liquid was deluging the rest of her, giving her strength, peace. The pain left her entirely, leaving a cool hum of pleasure in its place.</p><p>Stubborn man. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have given me so much.\u201d Even her throat was healed, the words leaving her smoothly.</p><p>\u201cI would give you all of it.\u201d</p><p>What a sweet thing to say. Sweet and wrong. She didn\u2019t want to hear things like that. Not now. It would make leaving him that much harder. \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p> <p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t leave without saying goodbye, so I had Lucien hunt down your spirit trail. Which means he saw where you\u2019d been, what paths you\u2019d taken. I will never forgive myself for how long it took us to locate you. And I will murder that fucking bastard Galen if it\u2019s the last thing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAeron,\u201d she interjected. She wouldn\u2019t have him endangering himself for her. \u201cJust hold me.\u201d</p><p>His arms settled under her knees and at her back, and he lifted her, cradling her against his chest. \u201cWhen we get home, you\u2019re going to tell me everything that was done to you. You might as well tell me what the demons did to you that first night, as well.\u201d With every word, his voice hardened. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m going to find Galen and the demons and return the favor. No one hurts my woman and lives.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>AERON LAID OLIVIA ON HIS BED as gently as possible. The swelling was gone, her cuts and bones healed, but he wasn\u2019t taking any chances. Legion was absent, and he was glad for that. He didn\u2019t know where she was; all he knew was that he couldn\u2019t deal with her right now. His darling Olivia...when he\u2019d found her...</p><p>His hands fisted. Wrath screamed for vengeance, and Aeron wanted to give it to him. Now. No waiting. He wanted Lucien to flash him to wherever Olivia had been held and just start killing. Actually, the \u201cwant\u201d was more of a need, like breathing and eating. But the cowards had already run away, the warehouse empty. That much Lucien had told him before carting him into that alley. Not that that mattered to his demon.Clearly Olivia had been beaten, tormented. Lucien had told him her energy had been bright red with pain and fear. Aeron didn\u2019t care what he had to do to find Galen. He was going to do it and finally kill the bastard.</p> <p>Slow and painful, Wrath said.</p><p>Slow and painful, he agreed. First, though, he would battle past those dark urges and have his promised chat with Olivia. Her comfort, her needs, came before everything. And also, he couldn\u2019t punish Galen properly until he knew exactly what the asshole had done to his woman.</p><p>He was going to punish him properly.</p><p>Relax. For Olivia. Aeron crouched beside the bed and Olivia rolled to her side, maintaining eye contact. \u201cI would\u2019ve understood if you\u2019d gone...home during Galen\u2019s interrogation,\u201d he said. In fact, he would have preferred it if she had. He would rather have lost her forevermore than know that she\u2019d suffered.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave. Yet. I had to make sure you got this.\u201d She lifted a small piece of folded gray material. \u201cIt\u2019s the Cloak of Invisibility.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, he could only blink in astonishment. Then he shook his head and laughed. His first in forever, it seemed. This tiny woman, this fallen angel, had done what an army of immortals had not been able to do. She\u2019d stolen the third artifact from under the Hunters\u2019 noses\u2014and she\u2019d trounced Galen in the process. Pride swelled his chest.</p><p>Reward.</p><p>First the demon had wanted to chastise Legion, now Wrath wanted to give Olivia a prize. We\u2019re on the same page, demon. \u201cThank you. Not that those two little words express the depths of my gratitude, but thank you all the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. So, what do you think of it? The artifact, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks so small.\u201d He studied it from every angle. So innocuous, too. \u201cHow does it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCover an entire body? It expands as you unfold it.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to leave her, even for a second, but he had to ensure the Cloak\u2019s protection. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute,\u201d he said, and she nodded.</p><p>He kissed her forehead, then stood reluctantly, practically sprinting from the room. The first warrior he ran into was\u2014Strider. Again. Aeron shoved the material into his hands and said, \u201cCloak of Invisibility. Give it to Torin for safekeeping. Thanks.\u201d There. Done. Not his problem anymore. And then he was off, heading back to his room.</p><p>Strider caught up to him just before he reached the door, grabbing his arm and jerking him to a stop. \u201cHow did you get this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Deets about the Cloak are on hold. We\u2019ve got more important things to discuss, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d He only had five days left with Olivia\u2014if he could convince her to stay for the rest of that time. If not... Hell, no. He would. He was a warrior. He would act like one. Victory, at any cost.</p><p>Heaven. Any cost.</p><p>Two against one. He liked his odds. Then, when their time was up, then he\u2019d finally have his vengeance.</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t wait,\u201d Strider insisted.</p><p>\u201cToo bad.\u201d His fingers curled around the knob.</p><p>His friend gave another jerk.</p><p>Aeron swung around, scowling. \u201cLet go of me, man. I\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor news like I\u2019ve got, you need to make time for me. \u2019Cause, here we go. You\u2019re about to lose your head. Literally. I wanted to break it to you gently, but you were too much of an ass.\u201d</p><p>He froze. \u201cWhat do you mean, lose my head? How do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDanika painted a new picture. In it, your head was detached from your body.\u201d</p><p>He was going to die? So far, Danika\u2019s paintings had never been proven wrong. The Lords hoped they could change some of their outcomes, sure, but had never really learned whether they could or not. Which meant it was more than likely that he was going to die.</p><p>He waited for rage to fill him. It didn\u2019t. He waited for sadness to overwhelm him. It didn\u2019t. He waited for the urge to drop to his knees and cry and beg for more time to claim him. Again, it didn\u2019t.</p><p>He\u2019d lived for thousands of years. And now, having met Olivia, he\u2019d led a full and glorious life. Because he\u2019d loved. His friends, definitely. His surrogate daughter, Legion, despite her recent actions. But mostly Olivia. He loved her. He could deny the emotion no longer. She was his. She was Wrath\u2019s. Their reason for being. The source of their happiness. Their obsession.</p><p>Their heaven.</p><p>He would have chased her all over the world, just for a few more minutes of her time. Minutes. Perhaps all they had left now, he mused, rather than the days he\u2019d thought to fight for. She was his everything, and he wasn\u2019t going to waste any more of their remaining time away from her.</p><p>Finally, he understood the humans. They didn\u2019t beg for more time because they wanted to spend what they had left enjoying each other. Not wishing for what could have been.</p><p>Wrath must have understood, as well. The demon wasn\u2019t crying, wasn\u2019t urging him to change his course. Without the angel, they had nothing. And as long as they completed their mission\u2014Galen\u2019s destruction\u2014they could die happy.</p><p>\u201cAeron,\u201d Strider prompted.</p><p>He forced himself back to the present. \u201cWho takes my head?\u201d He would still have to be with Legion. That couldn\u2019t change. He wouldn\u2019t allow his friends to deal with a mess of his creation without him, but he would take care of that once Olivia was gone and avenged. And then, then he could die in peace. It would be better that way, anyway. He didn\u2019t want to live without his Olivia.</p><p>Now he wouldn\u2019t have to.</p><p>\u201cLysander. I think. Cronus and Rhea are there. I\u2019ve talked to the others and we decided\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he said. What the others speculated didn\u2019t matter right now. If they didn\u2019t have facts, they didn\u2019t have anything he needed. \u201cTell me later. I appreciate the warning, but like I said, I\u2019m busy now.\u201d He pushed his way back into his bedroom and shut the door, his gaze remaining on Strider until the wood blocked them.</p><p>Any other time, the confusion and concern on Strider\u2019s face would have made him laugh.</p><p>There was a knock. \u201cAeron. Come on, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away or I swear to the gods I\u2019ll cut out your tongue and nail it to my wall.\u201d</p><p>That earned a growl. \u201cShut your mouth, Wrath. I\u2019m trying to ignore the challenge in your tone, but it\u2019s not working. Now listen. We can\u2019t lose you. We can\u2019t go through something like that again. We just can\u2019t.\u201d As he spoke, Strider pounded at the wood. \u201cYou remember how it was after Baden.\u201d</p><p>Not going there. Aeron opened the door, punched his friend in the face and shut it again.</p><p>Only a heartbeat later, Strider opened the door himself, punched Aeron twice, smiled sweetly, although a bit sadly, and replaced the block between them. \u201cI won. As for the other thing, you\u2019ve got thirty minutes, and then every single one of us will be inside that room to talk to you. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Unfortunately.</p><p>Footsteps echoed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Behind him, Aeron heard Olivia sit up. \u201cWhat\u2019s he talking about? Losing you? And why were you punching each other?\u201d</p><p>At the sound of her voice, Wrath uttered a sigh of contentment.</p><p>Slowly Aeron turned and faced her. Having her worry wasn\u2019t something he would allow, so he offered her a grin, one he hoped conveyed everything he felt for her. Perhaps it did. Her eyes widened, and she nervously licked her lips.</p> <p>\u201cIgnore him. I think he\u2019s suffering from brain damage.\u201d Which wasn\u2019t necessarily a lie. Aeron had always considered the warrior a bit deranged. \u201cBesides, we have unfinished business. I\u2019ve never had you in a bed, and I really want you in a bed.\u201d</p><p>Yes!</p><p>At first, she gave no reaction. Then, before panic could bloom inside him at the thought of a rejection\u2014no!\u2014she reached up to the collar of her robe and pulled. The material parted, revealing those beautiful breasts with their pink, pearled nipples, that smooth stomach and those long, perfect legs.</p><p>\u201cI would like that.\u201d</p><p>Yes, yes.</p> <p>A tremor traveled the length of him, his shaft filling, hardening. He stalked toward her, stripping along the way. A process that included kicking off his boots and stumbling over himself because he refused to stop, even for a second. Skin to skin. That\u2019s what he needed. When he reached her, he was as naked as she was. He crawled up her luscious body, settling some of his weight atop her.</p><p>Perfect. Heat, so much heat. They both hissed in a breath. She closed her eyes and arched against him, even as her hands clutched at his back. Her neck was exposed, her pulse hammering wildly. Her lips were parted, and her hair in tangles around her shoulders.</p><p>Passion had never looked more exquisite.</p><p>He should have spent every minute of their half hour pleasuring her senseless. Licking her, tasting her, sucking her. He should have started at her toes and worked his way to her mouth. He should have lingered over her thighs and her breasts. But he didn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t. He had to be inside her, couldn\u2019t go another minute without being joined, totally and completely, with her.</p><p>\u201cLock your ankles on my back,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate. Obeyed instantly.</p> <p>The moment she was opened up to him, he was shoving inside. Deep, so deep. As deep as he could go. A moan left her, because it wasn\u2019t the easiest of fits. His second thrust was a little smoother, though, and his third a rapturous glide.</p><p>\u201cAeron,\u201d she gasped out.</p><p>Mine.</p><p>Ours. Learn to share, Wrath. I\u2019ve had to. He braced his hands at her temples and rose, just a little, drinking her in while he moved in and out, in and out. He couldn\u2019t have stilled had Galen burst into the room and placed a gun to his head. This woman delighted him, frustrated him, enraptured him, angered him...belonged to him. As he belonged to her. He wanted to brand her, so that she\u2019d never forget him. He wanted to erase himself from her memory, so that she\u2019d never remember him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her to suffer when they parted. He wanted her to find someone else\u2014just as much as he wanted to kill that someone else. But mostly, he wanted her to be happy. To smile. To have her fun.</p><p>Fun. Yes. That\u2019s what he\u2019d give her this day. Fun.</p><p>\u201cDid I ever tell you why it\u2019s bad to be a penis?\u201d he asked, slowing his thrusts.</p><p>Her eyes blinked open. Passion still glowed in those sky-blue depths, but mixed with it was sudden confusion. \u201cWh-what?\u201d</p> <p>Paris had told him a lot of jokes over the years, but he only recalled this one. He\u2019d never been able to scrub the thing from his mind. \u201cWhy it\u2019s bad to be a penis.\u201d He twisted his hips on the inward glide, hitting her in a new spot.</p><p>A cry of delight parted her lips. \u201cNo. No, but it doesn\u2019t matter right now, I want you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad to be a penis because there\u2019s a hole in your head.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched as she clutched at him. \u201cI never thought of it like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it gets worse. Your owner is always strangling you.\u201d</p><p>The twitching became a half smile. Her knees tightened at his hips, and she bit her bottom lip. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shrink in cold water.\u201d</p><p>There was a strangled chuckle.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re forced to hang around with two nuts.\u201d</p><p>The chuckle became a full-fledged laugh. Gods, he loved the sound of her laughter. It was pure and magical, washing over him like a caress, dessert for his ears. He felt like a king, that he had been the one to cause that reaction in her.</p><p>\u201cWell, your penis can hang out with me anytime he wants.\u201d</p><p>Now he chuckled. He wished. Oh, how he wished. \u201cBaby, sweet baby,\u201d he said. \u201cMy baby.\u201d</p><p>Ours. Learn to share.</p><p>He twisted his hips again, and she again closed her eyes and cried out. She reached for the headboard, meshing her breasts into his chest, and met him thrust for thrust. Common sense slipped away, the need for completion taking over. Yes, yes, so good.</p><p>Her body squeezed at him, wet and warm and silky smooth. Faster and faster he pumped inside her, unable to slow, unable to savor. He had to hear her cries of abandon. Had to spurt his seed inside her. Had to brand her, just as he\u2019d wanted.</p><p>Soon she was thrashing beneath him. Soon she was calling his name over and over. She was all he could see, all he could hear, all he could smell, and he wanted that to last forever. But the more he pounded into her, the closer he came to the end. His muscles tensed, his blood heated to boiling, burning him up, ruining him for anything else. Anyone else. This was it. All he existed for. All his demon craved.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he roared, pushed over the edge.</p><p>Just like that, she climaxed as well, spasming around his shaft, hands back on him, nails digging deep. She even leaned up and bit the cord of his neck. Perhaps she drew blood. He didn\u2019t know, didn\u2019t care. Only knew that his body continued to rock into her, spurting and clenching and burning some more, his demon humming, purring, as lost as he was.</p><p>And when Olivia finally settled, when he finally caught his breath, he collapsed atop her before rolling to the side. Immediately she burrowed against him, several minutes passing in silence. Never had an orgasm been so intense, so consuming.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to brand her, but he was the one who\u2019d been branded. She was all over him, inside him, his everything. His every breath. With her, he was calm, the demon was calm, and life was everything he\u2019d ever dreamed.</p><p>\u201cThat was...that was...\u201d She sighed with contentment. One of her fingertips traced a heart on his chest.</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. You are, too. But...but...did you mean what you said?\u201d</p><p>Tread carefully. If he told her the truth, she might decide to stay, even though he had to be with Legion, even though his end was near, forcing her to witness both his betrayal and his death. Forcing her to live without him if\u2014when\u2014Danika\u2019s vision proved true.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, then cursed under his breath. Still, regret wouldn\u2019t come. She deserved to know. She was more to him than sex. She was more to him than, well, anything. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Aeron. I love\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not say another word, Olivia,\u201d a male growled from the center of the room.</p><p>At the interruption, Wrath snarled in fury.</p><p>Aeron stiffened, already reaching for the blades resting on his nightstand. He didn\u2019t relax when he spotted Lysander, gold wings outstretched, white robe glowing in the moonlight. The man\u2019s eyes were narrowed with fury.</p><p>Who takes my head? he\u2019d asked Strider.</p><p>Lysander. I think.</p><p>\u201cLysander,\u201d Olivia gasped out, holding the bedsheet to her chest. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to her like that.\u201d Aeron stood, jerked on a pair of pants, and said, \u201cTell us what you want and leave.\u201d Don\u2019t be here for the reason I think you\u2019re here. I\u2019m not ready yet.</p><p>Lysander met his stare and uttered the words Aeron dreaded hearing. \u201cI want your head. And I won\u2019t leave until I\u2019ve taken it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p>FINALLY, LEGION FOUND GALEN. He was in a dingy pub in London. She\u2019d been flashing all over the place, from Buda to Belgium to the Netherlands, and now London. The coward had flown himself here and was nursing a glass of whiskey in a shadowed corner. She could smell the ambrosia he\u2019d already consumed; she recognized the sweet scent because Paris always smelled like that, and she knew Galen would be drunk very soon. She had only to wait.</p><p>She was too impatient to wait.Her gaze raked over her own body. She still wore that T-shirt and jeans. They were plain but clean. And though they weren\u2019t revealing, her breasts were so large they stretched the material. Several men had noticed her already and whistled as she strolled by. Outwardly, she\u2019d paid them no heed. Inwardly, she\u2019d thrilled at being viewed as something other than ugly, disgusting or at best, something to be tolerated.</p><p>She stopped at Galen\u2019s table, and he looked up through the dark shield of his lashes. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>Steady. Instinct demanded she attack first and ask questions later. Resist. Galen delighted in tricking the Lords, in sending Bait to distract them before acting. Today, she would be their Bait.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d she said, and he was. With his pale hair and pale blue eyes, with his flawless features and sensual mouth, he was every woman\u2019s fantasy. But he\u2019d helped destroy her Aeron\u2019s life, and for that he would pay. \u201cI want you.\u201d Dead, but she didn\u2019t add that part.</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cOf course you do. You can\u2019t help yourself. None of you can.\u201d He almost sounded...upset by that. \u201cHere\u2019s a little news flash for you. No matter what I make you feel, hopeful for a future, a wedding, babies, you\u2019re not going to get it from me.\u201d There at the end, he\u2019d been sneering. He drained the rest of his drink. \u201cNow go away like I told you. I came here for peace and quiet.\u201d</p><p>He was the second man to turn her away since her transformation. She couldn\u2019t help herself; she slapped him. His head whipped to the side, and a trickle of blood formed at the corner of his mouth. Guess I\u2019m stronger than I thought, she mused smugly. Good. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he faced her this next time, his expression was lit with interest. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you didn\u2019t hear me when I said I wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you thought slapping me would win me over?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re still here, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He studied her before moving his gaze across the bar. \u201cSo where do you want me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathroom.\u201d No witnesses. Not for what she had planned. \u201cAnd by the way. I don\u2019t want to wed you and I don\u2019t want your babies. We\u2019re gonna have sex, and you\u2019re gonna like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForceful little thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea. So we doing this or not?\u201d</p> <p>Those lush lips twitched. \u201cLet me get this straight. We\u2019re going to the bathroom, and I\u2019m going to fuck you, and you don\u2019t even care to know my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d actually prefer it if you\u2019d keep your stupid mouth closed.\u201d Oops. Her hatred was slipping out.</p><p>\u201cWell, well. You might just be my soul mate.\u201d He was on his feet a second later, his chair skidding over the sticky floor. He didn\u2019t say another word as he kicked into motion, arm snaking around her waist and pulling her along with him.</p><p>There was a woman in the bathroom, washing her hands, and Galen pushed her out without preamble.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the girl cried in irritation. She softened as her gaze raked him. \u201cHey.\u201d Sultry now.</p><p>\u201cStay out or die,\u201d he told her flatly. And then he slammed the door closed and whipped around to face Legion.</p> <p>She trembled, she just couldn\u2019t help herself. There was so much heat in his eyes she was momentarily shocked stupid. It was what she\u2019d wanted from Aeron. What she might never get.</p><p>One step, two, he approached her. She backed away. Attack now. Kill him. But she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d he asked silkily. \u201cYou should be.\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin, looked behind her\u2014and saw the counter and the mirror. Her reflection stunned her. The fall of golden hair, just begging for a man\u2019s hands. The wide, dark eyes so filled with longing.</p><p>Longing? She wanted him? Him? How could she want Hope? He was her enemy. He was Aeron\u2019s enemy.</p><p>Strong hands banded around her waist and hefted her up. She gasped as she returned her focus to him. He was already working the button of her jeans. That button gave easily and then he was jerking them off her legs.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cNo panties. You are eager for me.\u201d</p><p>His amusement irritated her\u2014even as it spiced her desire up another notch. That wasn\u2019t because of him, she told herself. She refused to believe so. She\u2019d wanted to have sex; that was one of the reasons she\u2019d bargained for this body. She\u2019d expected it to be with Aeron, though.</p> <p>Yet he might never want her that way. Not really.</p><p>\u201cWho said I was eager for you? You\u2019re beautiful, yeah, but you\u2019re just a substitute for someone else.\u201d Truth. A truth she liked. She could use him. Have the sex she wanted and then kill him.</p><p>Galen\u2019s eyes narrowed to tiny slits. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go, talking again. I thought I told you how much I hated that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who better watch her mouth.\u201d With a growl, he ripped off her shirt. She wasn\u2019t wearing a bra, either. He didn\u2019t ask for permission, but leaned forward and sucked a nipple into his mouth. A mouth that was hot as fire and had her moaning. In pleasure.</p><p>This was...wonderful.</p><p>Yes. Yes, she\u2019d have the sex she wanted. It would distract him so that she could more easily go in for the kill. That was all the rationale she needed to spread her legs and jerk him into her. His pants-clad erection hit her sweet spot, and she cried out.</p><p>Wonderful was not the word to describe that. Perfection was. How much better would it have been with Aeron, then? Aeron. She didn\u2019t want to think about him right now. She only wanted to feel.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she found herself commanding. She arched into him, rubbing herself against him. Her skin was sensitized and only growing more so. There was an ache inside her, a heat like the one she\u2019d seen in his eyes. Both were building.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even want foreplay?\u201d Galen worked at his pants, freeing his erection. It was big. So deliciously big. Demons often had sex while in hell\u2014with each other, the damned souls\u2014so she knew big was preferred and small ridiculed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s foreplay?\u201d Truly. She had no clue.</p><p>He chuckled again. \u201cI like you, female. I really do.\u201d He tried to kiss her, but she turned her head. He followed the movement, and she turned her head again.</p><p>\u201cNo kissing,\u201d she rasped. She wanted to, oh, did she want to, but kissing would kill him before she was finished with him. She looked like a human, yes, but her teeth were pure poison. She could taste it.</p><p>She settled her ankles on his lower back, digging in, forcing him to move against her. Mind...fogging...body...burning...</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Not like it\u2019s anything special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCease...talking!\u201d she growled.</p><p>His snarl was like a caress. \u201cFine. You want a quick fuck, that\u2019s all you\u2019ll get.\u201d He gripped the base of his erection and aimed it between her legs, then he was thrusting forward, all the way inside her.</p><p>She cried out in pain, but the pain disappeared as quickly as it had sprouted, leaving only a feeling of utter possession. \u201cMore.\u201d He stretched her, filled her up, and it was heady. No wonder all manner of beings did this so often.</p><p>\u201cVirgin?\u201d he gasped out, clearly shocked. Wonder of wonders, it appeared as if his expression was softening.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business. Finish.\u201d</p><p>He bared his teeth at her, but in and out he pumped. The stretching and the fullness only increased, pushing her toward...something. Soon she was thrashing against him, desperate for that something, willing to kill everyone in this building if she didn\u2019t get it.</p><p>\u201cHurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGods, you feel good.\u201d</p><p>She clawed at him, hurtling over...finally over...drifting, spinning, floating, seeing stars winking over her eyes. Every muscle in her body clamped down, let go, clamped down again. It was powerful, it was moving, but all too soon it faded. Leaving her strangely shattered.</p><p>Her eyelids flickered open. She was panting. Galen was still inside her, still moving in and out. Absolute pleasure consumed every inch of his features. He must be getting close to his end, as she had done.</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t allow that, she thought. He didn\u2019t deserve to feel like that. Even though he\u2019d made her feel better than she ever had before. Even though sex was her new favorite game and she planned to have it as often as possible.</p><p>\u201cGalen,\u201d she said, and his shocked gaze met hers. A tremor moved through her, reigniting the fire in her blood. How odd. But there was no time to enjoy another round. \u201cSee you in hell.\u201d</p><p>With that, she sank her teeth into his neck, clamping down as he roared. A roar born of pain rather than completion. He shoved at her, trying to rip her away, but she held tight, pumping her poison deep into his vein. Only when the last drop left her did she lift her head and smile at him. He\u2019d gone pale, almost green.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you...do to me?\u201d His knees gave out and he sank to the floor.</p><p>Silent, she hopped to her feet and dressed. Her knees trembled the entire time. Part of her wanted to stay, to ease him, but she couldn\u2019t forget who and what he was\u2014not again. This had to be done. For Aeron. She owed him this much, at the very least.</p><p>\u201cI planned to take you to my man and have him kill you, but this is better. Have a nice life,\u201d she said, and then blew Galen a kiss. \u201cNot that it\u2019ll last much longer.\u201d</p><p>AERON STARED over at Lysander. The threat of decapitation had been issued, the angel\u2019s determination unwavering. \u201cOlivia,\u201d he said. He hadn\u2019t moved from beside the bed. He and Wrath were both oddly calm. \u201cReturn home. Now. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No.\u201d She threw her arms around his waist, pressing her cheek into his back. The wet warmth of her tears scalded him. \u201cDon\u2019t do this. Please, don\u2019t do this.\u201d\u201cYou have caused her nothing but pain, demon,\u201d Lysander gritted out. \u201cYou did not see her tortured at your enemy\u2019s hand. I did. You didn\u2019t beg her to return home to save herself the pain. I did. And why did she deny me? Because she\u2019d made a promise to you. Because she wanted to say goodbye. Again, to you. I will not give you time to wheedle another promise from her. I will not give you another opportunity to make a mockery of my pact with you. This ends now. Today.\u201d One moment his hands were empty, the next he clutched that sword of fire. A sword he twirled, sparks of flame crackling from it.</p><p>Not yet, Wrath cried. Not yet. We must kill Galen first.</p><p>\u201cLysander, no!\u201d Olivia cried. Realizing she\u2019d get nowhere with Aeron, she attempted to move in front of him. \u201cNot the sword. Anything but the sword. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>Reeling from the force of his guilt, Aeron pushed her back onto the bed and spread his wings to full length. He wanted this battle out of the room and away from Olivia. And there would be a battle. He wouldn\u2019t simply lie down and die. Not yet, as his demon had reminded him. He had too much to do.</p><p>\u201cYou want me,\u201d he told the warrior angel, \u201cthen come and get me.\u201d With that, he launched himself out the window, breaking the glass with the force of his momentum before soaring high into the sky.</p><p>Along the way, he dropped his daggers, watching them thump harmlessly on the ground. Olivia loved Lysander. No matter what, even to save himself, Aeron wouldn\u2019t kill the warrior. That would hurt Olivia, and Aeron vowed then and there never to do so again.</p><p>No matter the consequences.</p><p>Lysander was quick to follow. He knew because Olivia screamed, \u201cNo, Lysander. Don\u2019t do this! Come back.\u201d</p><p>He hated her worry, her despair. Later, if he still lived, he would soothe her. Give her anything she desired. He would also find a way to save Legion from Lucifer\u2019s possession without having to touch her. He had to. He couldn\u2019t give himself to any woman but Olivia. He had no illusions about that now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d stayed for him. She\u2019d endured a Hunter\u2019s brutality for him. He would not penalize her for that.</p><p>Reward.</p><p>Always. Aeron twisted midair, and sure enough, a scowling Lysander was only a few feet away. He no longer held the sword, his hands empty but balled. The moment their gazes met, both of them stilled, hovering, not quite within striking distance.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d Aeron said.</p><p>\u201cIt can be no other way. You claim to love her,\u201d the angel snarled, \u201cand yet you would keep her here while you bed another. You would ruin her spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had planned to let her go first!\u201d But would he ever have been able to do so? He\u2019d wanted to kill something every time he\u2019d considered it. And when she\u2019d wanted to go, he\u2019d convinced her to stay a little longer. Despite the danger.</p><p>No, he never would have been able to let her go. He never would have been able to sleep with Legion.</p><p>He would have reached this decision eventually. Lysander had merely sped it along.</p> <p>\u201cI will only ever be with her,\u201d he said with a proud tilt of his chin.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s worth continuing to allow her to put herself at risk? Do you know what the Hunters did to her?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, stomach clenched painfully. \u201cNo. But I saw her, saw the end results, and I will be haunted by that image for all eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not enough! Listen. And know. Stefano hit her with a closed fist, as well as an open palm. He broke her bones. Tried to drown her. She, who has not a single thread of malice inside her. And the demons, the ones she battled to reach you? They touched her in places only a lover should. But she endured it all. For you.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that, Aeron spread his arms, face lifted to the highest part of the sky and roared. Roared with fury so potent he had never known its like. He\u2019d known Olivia had been hurt; as he\u2019d said, he\u2019d seen the evidence. He\u2019d raged even then. But now, having the details tossed at him, sharper than any blade...that rage intensified. Grew. She was so delicate, so fragile. She could have died, alone and human. Wrecked by pain.</p><p>Punish.</p> <p>\u201cStefano will pay. By my hand.\u201d Target, switched. End result, the same. Another vow. He\u2019d already decided to kill anyone involved, but this...Stefano would be brought to the brink of death over and over again, only to be revived so they could start again. \u201cThe demons, too.\u201d</p><p>PUNISH!</p><p>\u201cI have stood back and watched all of this, helpless to stop it from happening.\u201d Some of Lysander\u2019s own rage seemed to cool. \u201cI tried bargaining with you. I tried helping your cause, even distracting the gods who pulled your strings. But no longer. You will feel pain by my hand. You will suffer as my Olivia has suffered.\u201d</p><p>Pinpricks of red dotted Aeron\u2019s vision. \u201cShe is not your Olivia. She is mine.\u201d</p><p>Ours. Ours to protect, ours to reward.</p><p>\u201cFor how much longer?\u201d the angel snapped.</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you understand?\u201d Lysander shouted. \u201cYou can\u2019t give her forever. You decided not to bed the demon Legion, only Olivia, so Lucifer will be coming for you. There\u2019s no way around that. Your friends will die, one by one. Their demons will not be able to defeat their master. And that\u2019s what Lucifer is to them. Master. The women will be next. Think that your woman, your human woman, will be overlooked? Only your death can fix the problems you have wrought.\u201d</p> <p>Wings flapped, a war cry sounded, and then Lysander was there, all distance between them conquered. They collided, rolling through the air. Fists hammered at him, even as his own hammered at the angel in defense. There were grunts and groans, explosions of breath. Their legs tangled, kicked.</p><p>So engrossed did they become, they forgot to flap their wings and began to fall toward a rocky cliff in a clashing heap. Just before contact, Aeron realized what was happening and latched onto the angel\u2019s hair, pushing his wings with all his might. The two of them darted back into the sky.</p><p>Lysander ripped free and nailed Aeron in the mouth. Pain exploded through his teeth and gums, blood trickling down his throat. As the angel came at him again, Aeron kicked him in the stomach, sending him propelling backward. They\u2019d reached the fortress, and the angel slammed into a wall. Stones crumbled and dust plumed around him.</p><p>Through that dust, he shot forward, knocking into Aeron and sending him hurtling back toward the ground. This time, he didn\u2019t catch himself and hit full force. Oxygen abandoned him, nothing more than a sweet dream. A few bones even snapped apart.</p><p>He quickly stood\u2014cringed as his ankle gave\u2014and pushed back into the air. One of his wings was broken. Not again, he thought, ignoring the pain screaming through him. Where was Lysander? His gaze circled the area, but he\u2014 A hard weight punted him in the back, spinning him through the air.</p><p>He knew Lysander would be waiting, ready to punch him the moment he stilled. And so when that inevitable moment of stillness came, he slashed first, managing to make contact with Lysander\u2019s side. Perhaps smashing a kidney.</p><p>That would have felled anyone else. The angel merely grunted. But he didn\u2019t attack again. He remained in place, golden wings gliding smoothly up and down. \u201cYou want to save both Olivia and Legion, as well as your friends?\u201d</p><p>Aeron, too, remained in place, panting, sweating. \u201cYes.\u201d More than anything.</p><p>\u201cWell, the only way to do that is to die.\u201d</p><p>Of course Lysander would say so. \u201cLegion\u2019s bargain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs voided if you die before the allotted time. That was part of their terms.\u201d</p><p>Voided. Voided with his death. She would be free. His friends could live without the threat she now presented. But... \u201cOlivia?\u201d he asked through the sudden knot in his throat.</p><p>\u201cWill be able to go home, without the guilt of knowing you hurt someone you loved because of her. Without the burden of wondering if you will one day resent her. Without the shame of leaving you behind, if she decided you would one day resent her. Without being captured once more by your enemy. Without fearing she\u2019ll be forced to kill you.\u201d</p><p>She would do anything for Aeron. He knew that now. She would endure any hardship, any mental or physical pain. And that\u2019s what his life would bring her. Pain. No matter what he did, how he lived, he would bring her pain. Key word: lived.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t do that to her. Couldn\u2019t give her that choice. She shouldn\u2019t have to endure anything, whether she was willing or not.</p><p>Without him, she could live without guilt and shame. Without pain. And that was what got him. The thought of her living as she was meant to: happy, free, safe.</p><p>We are to die now? Wrath asked, knowing, as he always did, the direction of Aeron\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>I am.</p><p>And me?</p><p>You will continue on. Crazed, but Aeron didn\u2019t remind the demon of that.</p><p>To punish. A statement, not a question.</p><p>Yes. To punish. He prayed the demon remembered this after their parting. They hurt her.</p><p>So they will die.</p><p>So simple. Thank you for everything. Now, for the rest. \u201cYou\u2019ll protect her?\u201d he asked Lysander. \u201cAlways?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd my demon?\u201d If the angel meant to\u2014</p><p>\u201cYour demon will be contained. Galen now has Distrust, therefore to balance the scales, I will capture Wrath and give him to Cronus. I have already spoken to the god king, and he has chosen a body. A body that belongs to someone he\u2019ll be able to monitor himself, ensuring she doesn\u2019t aid your enemy or hurt your friends.\u201d</p><p>Panic bloomed. \u201cShe?\u201d Not Olivia, not Legion. Surely.</p><p>\u201cNo, not Olivia or Legion,\u201d Lysander assured him, clearly sensing his thoughts. \u201cHave no worries on that score. Legion will return home. And as I told you, I will see to Olivia\u2019s care myself, now and always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrath has a mission to complete. Will you ensure that Cronus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sense the nature of the mission, and I will ensure it\u2019s completed. In a manner you would find highly satisfactory.\u201d</p><p>Very well, then. Though he hated that he would have no part in the upcoming massacre, and that\u2019s what it would be. \u201cI have one last request, before I allow you to end my life.\u201d</p><p>A nod. \u201cAsk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia craves fun. She needs to have fun.\u201d</p><p>Before the last word had left Aeron\u2019s mouth, Lysander had begun shaking his head. \u201cSuch a need stemmed from her association with you. Once you are gone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVow it or the fight continues!\u201d On this, too, he would not bend.</p><p>Lysander scowled at him. \u201cI will do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t good enough,\u201d he gritted out. \u201cYou live with Bianka, a Harpy. I know the little witch is fun incarnate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lysander said, and there was pride in his tone. Pride Aeron probably exhibited himself when he spoke of Olivia. \u201cVery well. I will make certain they spend time together.\u201d</p><p>All the details were taken care of, then.</p><p>Death, he thought next. Here it was, staring him in the eye. It had finally caught up with him, and he was willing. There was no resistance on his part. Again, he waited for emotions to consume him but again, they remained absent.</p><p>He would have liked to say goodbye to Olivia, to remind her that he loved her. But she would try and talk him out of this. He knew it, just as he knew he would crumble. This had to happen now.</p><p>Aeron drew in a deep breath, held it...held it...Then, as he slowly released it, he splayed his arms. \u201cDo it. Take my head.\u201d</p><p>Lysander merely looked at him, head tilting to the side curiously, as if he hadn\u2019t expected Aeron to comply. \u201cYou are sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The angel stretched out his arm and the fiery sword once more appeared.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Olivia screamed from below them. \u201cNo! Aeron! Lysander! Please, no!\u201d</p><p>Aeron didn\u2019t want her to see this, but it was too late to ask Lysander to whisk them to another location. That sword of fire was already arcing toward him.</p><p>Goodbye, Aeron, Wrath said softly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He felt the first sizzle of contact, and then he knew nothing more.</p><p>OLIVIA SCREAMED and screamed and screamed. Aeron. Dead. Gone forever. His beautiful warrior\u2019s body had gone limp, had fallen from the sky. A fall that had seemed to last forever, slow and agonizing, taunting her and making her hope that maybe, maybe, he would land softly, and he would be okay. She had only to reach him...</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she sobbed, racing out of his bedroom and heading outside. But deep down, she knew. Reaching him wouldn\u2019t make a difference. Aeron. Dead. Gone forever.</p> <p>LEGION HAD JUST FLASHED BACK to the fortress to tell Aeron what she\u2019d done when she felt her bond to him break. And she knew. Knew. Only one thing would break a bond like theirs.</p><p>Death.She was alive, so that meant\u2014 No. No! Never. She shook her head violently. \u201cAeron! Aeron!\u201d Without their bond, she couldn\u2019t remain here. She would\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she screamed, even as she was tugged from the fortress and back into hell.</p><p>As the flames enveloped her, she heard Lucifer\u2019s scream echo her own. \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p> <p>OLIVIA CRIED until she had no more tears left, Aeron\u2019s body clutched in her arms. She barely noticed as the sun fell and rose again. Barely noticed as Aeron\u2019s friends descended. Upon seeing what had become of the warrior, Strider had dropped to his knees and howled. Torin had wept. Lucien had waited to escort his soul, but was never summoned, and no one knew why. Maddox had raged for answers, and most of the others had stood staring in shock and disbelief, pallid, shaking. Even Gideon had stumbled his way outside, and oh, his tears had destroyed her. But the reaction that had slayed her most, the one that had torn her up and left her raw, was Sabin\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNot him,\u201d the warrior had uttered brokenly. \u201cNot this man. Take me instead.\u201dA sentiment she, too, wallowed in.</p><p>Like her, they refused to leave the hill. Cameo tried to convince her to rise, to let Aeron go, so that others could hold him and say their goodbyes. She refused. Even slapped those strong arms away from her. Finally, they left her alone, but she knew they waited nearby, watching, wanting their turn.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be the end, she thought, dazed. It simply couldn\u2019t be. No immortal could recover from decapitation. She knew that. But this just couldn\u2019t be the end.</p><p>Aeron couldn\u2019t die alone.</p><p>The words drifted through her mind once, then a second and third time. Aeron couldn\u2019t die alone.</p> <p>Aeron couldn\u2019t die alone.</p><p>On every level, this death was wrong. Needless, senseless.</p><p>Aeron couldn\u2019t die alone\u2014and he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Hope suddenly bloomed from the darkness of her soul, and though it required every ounce of strength she possessed, Olivia at last released the warrior\u2014no, hold him, never let go\u2014and picked herself up off the ground. Oh, no. He wouldn\u2019t die alone, she vowed.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d one of his waiting friends said, closing in on her, projecting so much sorrow, so much regret, so much pain.</p><p>Ignore. Closing her eyes, she splayed her arms and lifted her head to the gleaming sun. Act. \u201cI\u2019m ready to return home. To claim my rightful place in the sky. To be the angel I was created to be.\u201d</p><p>Instantly she was caught up in the sky, wings sprouting from her back in one glorious wave. She curled them around herself and looked them over, shocked to see no threads of gold. No longer a warrior, then. Funny. No longer a warrior, yet never in her life had she been more intent on fighting for something.</p><p>Aeron wouldn\u2019t die alone.</p> <p>Lysander was beside her a second later, his expression so tortured he looked as if he were in physical pain. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Olivia, but it had to be done. It was the only way.\u201d</p><p>There was true remorse in his voice, and she nodded to acknowledge it. \u201cYou did what you had to do, just as I will.\u201d She didn\u2019t give him time to question her. No, she marched toward the tribunal chamber, ready to face the Council.</p><p>AERON SLOWLY OPENED HIS EYES. The first thought to hit him: how was he able to do so? Frowning, he reached up, and wonder of wonders, he had eyes, a nose and a mouth. His head was attached to his body, but strangely enough, there were no scabs on his neck\u2014or tattoos on his arms, he realized with shock when he spotted smooth, tanned skin.</p><p>Frown intensifying, he sat up. He experienced no dizziness, no pain, just a cool breeze that wrapped around him as if hugging him in welcome. His gaze moved over his body. Intact. Unharmed. He was lying on a marble dais, and he was wearing a white robe, much like Olivia\u2019s. His legs were also devoid of tattoos.How was that possible? How was any of it possible?</p><p>Lysander hadn\u2019t missed. He\u2019d felt the burn.</p><p>So what had happened? And where was he? He studied his surroundings. There was a mistlike quality to the air, as if he were trapped inside a dream. There were no houses, no streets, only alabaster column after alabaster column with dewy ivy that climbed the sides.</p><p>Heaven? Had he somehow been made into an angel? He reached around and felt his back. No. No wings. Disappointment rocked him. As an angel, he would have been able to search for Olivia, to be with her.</p><p>Olivia. Sweet, sweet Olivia. His chest ached and his hands itched to touch her. He would miss her every day of his...life? Death? Utterly and without waning. Where was she now? What was she doing?</p><p>\u201cAeron.\u201d</p><p>The deep voice hit him, and he shook in recognition and shock.</p><p>Though thousands of years had passed since he\u2019d heard that raspy timbre, he knew who it belonged to instantly. Baden. Once his best friend, but centuries deceased. Aeron pushed to his feet and turned, unsure of what he\u2019d find. How...?</p><p>Baden stood only a few feet away.</p><p>Aeron battled through the shock. His friend looked the same as when he\u2019d been alive. Tall, muscled, bright red hair that shagged around his face. Brown eyes, sun-darkened skin. Like Aeron, he wore a white robe.</p><p>\u201cHow are you...how are we...?\u201d Still the questions wouldn\u2019t form, so great was his astonishment.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed. A lot.\u201d Baden grinned, revealing straight white teeth, and rather than answer, he raked Aeron with his gaze. \u201cBut gods, I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>And then they were running toward each other, wrapping their arms around each other. Aeron held tight. He\u2019d never thought to see this man again. Yet here he was, holding his best friend close.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too,\u201d he managed to choke past the hard lump in his throat.</p><p>A long while passed before they pulled back. Aeron still couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. That he was here, with Baden. Touching him, seeing him.</p><p>Last time they\u2019d been together, before Baden\u2019s beheading, Aeron had wanted to set the man on fire. Or rather, Wrath had wanted him to do so. Baden had torched an entire village, certain they plotted his murder, and Aeron\u2019s demon had yearned to repay him in kind, fire for fire, even though guilt had ravaged Baden, perhaps even leading to his \u201ctrust\u201d in Hadiee, the Bait who\u2019d led him to his slaughter.</p><p>Now Aeron felt...nothing but kinship. No menace of any kind. No urge to grab a match. There were no images inside his head, either. No screams in his ears. Actually, he didn\u2019t sense Wrath at all.</p><p>That made no sense. He still had his head, so Wrath had to be inside him. Right?</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd how are we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the afterlife, my friend. Created by Zeus after our possession, just in case our demons killed us. He didn\u2019t want our tainted souls able to reach him. And yeah, I know it would have been nice to know we had a place to stay, but the old bastard never breathed a word.\u201d Baden pivoted and waved his hand over their surroundings. \u201cI call it Bad\u2019s Land. Get it? Baden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill no sense of humor, I see. We\u2019ll have to work on that. Anyway, I know it\u2019s not much to look at and the place is boring as shit, but it\u2019s better than the alternative.\u201d</p><p>The alternative? \u201cSo I really am dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid so.\u201d</p><p>His shoulders slumped, a paltry motion for the sense of crushing loss suddenly plaguing him. No chance to search for Olivia, then.</p><p>And no Wrath, he realized with a sharp inhalation. His demon had been taken from him, released when he died. He was alone. Truly alone, for the first time in centuries.</p><p>He was...saddened. Yes, saddened. There at the end, they\u2019d reached an accord.</p><p>\u201cAre you and I the only ones here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There are a few others, but they keep their distance from me. I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m as sweet as a sugar cookie. Not that I\u2019ve gotten to enjoy one lately,\u201d Baden grumbled. \u201cPandora, though...\u201d He shuddered. \u201cShe also resides here and she does not keep her distance. Unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>Again Aeron battled back his shock. Pandora. The woman who\u2019d been given charge of dimOuniak, the box holding all the escaped demon High Lords captive. The woman who had taunted him and his friends with her elevated status, reminding them over and over again that the gods had overlooked them.</p><p>Once he\u2019d despised her. Now...so many years had passed since he\u2019d even thought of her, he couldn\u2019t dredge up the hate. Was he overjoyed to know she was here and nearby, however? Hell, no.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you killed her?\u201d he asked. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not strong enough,\u201d a female said from behind them.</p><p>In unison, they spun. Pandora rested against one of the columns, arms crossed over her chest.</p><p>Seeing her, even though he\u2019d been warned of her presence, was like being punched in the face with brass knuckles. Aeron looked her over. Like him and Baden, she was tall and muscled, though on a much smaller scale. Her brown hair hit her chin and trapped her face. A face too harsh to be pretty. Her eyes were gold. Too gold. Too bright. Otherworldly. And filled with disdain.</p><p>The same look she\u2019d always given him in the heavens.</p><p>Ah. There was his old sense of loathing, rising inside him, filling him. Even in death he was to have an enemy, it seemed.</p><p>\u201cMust be my birthday,\u201d she said with a cruel smile. \u201cOne by one the men who sent me here have decided to join me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re mistaken. The gift is mine. Now your eternal torment can be ensured.\u201d</p><p>She stepped toward him\u2014to attack?\u2014but stopped herself and offered another smile. \u201cSo. How\u2019s Maddox? Dying, I hope.\u201d</p><p>Maddox had been the one to kill her. The warrior had been lost to his demon, Violence, and had stabbed her, over and over again. \u201cYou\u2019ll be disappointed to know he\u2019s well. He\u2019s even expecting a child.\u201d</p> <p>Breath hitched in her throat. \u201cIs he now? How wonderful.\u201d She exhaled, and with the release, a dam seemed to break inside her. \u201cThat bastard! He doesn\u2019t deserve to be happy! He killed me, allowed my box to be stolen, and now no one knows where it is. It\u2019s our ticket out of here, but nooo. Even I can\u2019t find it. He ruined everything and now his dreams are coming true? You think I didn\u2019t know that he always wanted a family? I knew! But he was supposed to die! He was the one who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, get over yourself already.\u201d Baden tossed Aeron a see-what-I\u2019ve-had-to-endure look. \u201cGods. You\u2019re just as much of a bitch now as you were then.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Panting. Her eyes narrowed on the redhead. \u201cFeeling invincible now that you have a friend to protect you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly. I\u2019m invincible either way.\u201d</p><p>They continued to bicker, but Aeron tuned them out, his attention locked on part of Pandora\u2019s impassioned speech. Finding the box, dimOuniak, would free them from this realm? Truth or lie, he didn\u2019t know. What he did know? If he could escape, he could search for Olivia, as he\u2019d wanted.</p> <p>Would she be able to see him?</p><p>Yes or no, he didn\u2019t care. He would be able to see her.</p><p>That box is mine.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p><p>OLIVIA STOOD in front of the Heavenly High Council, life and death in their hands for the second time. For days she\u2019d pleaded her case, refusing to give up or leave, but they\u2019d continued to reject her, too satisfied with the outcome. Aeron was dead, as they\u2019d wanted, and Legion returned to hell. Her home. Something Lysander hadn\u2019t fully explained to Aeron.</p><p>She splayed her arms, her wings, and turned, letting them see her. All of her. Aeron\u2019s blood had been cleaned from her robe, but not her hands. She hadn\u2019t let her hands even graze the material. She wanted those in charge to see what they had wrought.Her gaze locked with every member, perched as they were atop their thrones. They were beautiful, each of them. Strong and proud and pure. They felt justified. They felt exonerated. They did not flinch under her probing stare.</p> <p>Do not waver. You are confident, aggressive. \u201cBy punishing him,\u201d she called, \u201cyou have punished me. Eternally. I fell, yes, but you allowed me to return. I am once again like you. An angel. That means my soul is as pure as yours. Therefore I ask you\u2014what have I done to earn such a punishment?\u201d</p><p>At last, a murmur arose.</p><p>Hope bloomed once again.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d one of the males asked her.</p><p>\u201cAllowing you to return here was not meant to be a punishment, but a privilege.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Aeron. I cannot be happy without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can,\u201d one of the females said. \u201cYou just need time to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No time. I deserve to be as joyful as I have made thousands of others, and I have told you what that will entail.\u201d</p> <p>This time, there were no murmurs. Only silence. Heavy silence. Defeating silence. Still she didn\u2019t bow her head or apologize for her impudence. She wouldn\u2019t back down. Not about this. If they would not give Aeron back to her, she would die with him.</p><p>He would not die alone.</p><p>Confident. \u201cIf you leave things as they are, a good man slain, you will be no better than the ones you protect the humans against.\u201d They would be like the demons. She left that unsaid, but her meaning was clear.</p><p>\u201cGood men are slain all the time, Olivia. That is the price of free will.\u201d Another of the females, her tone softer now, bearing a hint of compassion.</p><p>Aggressive. \u201cWe punished Aeron for his choices. Why can\u2019t we reward him, as well? For that is what truly sets us apart. Our compassion, our kindness. Our love. Love he himself has demonstrated to a humbling extent. He gave up his life for mine. Does that sacrifice not outweigh his crime? Has he not proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that he\u2019s worthy of redemption?\u201d</p><p>Murmurs again. And then, finally, a sigh.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps something can be arranged....\u201d</p><p>THE DAYS PASSED in quick succession, one fading into another. Aeron spent all of his time with Baden. They talked, laughed, cried and caught up, all the while dissecting possible locations for Pandora\u2019s box. His determination to find that box was stronger than ever. Not to stop the Hunters\u2014though that would be a wonderful bonus\u2014but for Olivia.</p><p>He found that he didn\u2019t need to sleep, and he didn\u2019t need to eat. He merely existed in the endless white, his resolve unwavering.So far, they\u2019d developed a few good theories. The box was hidden in plain sight. Perhaps stored in a realm like this one, no one able to flash inside. Perhaps buried at the bottom of the sea. Who had taken it, though, and why, they still hadn\u2019t figured out.</p><p>\u201cI want to go back so badly,\u201d Baden said as they walked through the mist. They did their best thinking this way. \u201cEvery so often, at random times, we\u2019re given glimpses of life down there, but they\u2019re never enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you seen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few of Sabin\u2019s battles with Hunters before he moved to Budapest. Your fortress. The explosion that brought you all back together. Each of the women who\u2019ve helped you. Lucien is a lucky bastard. His woman is my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d probably offer him condolences if you actually met Anya.\u201d</p><p>Baden laughed. \u201cA troublemaker, is she? But then, aren\u2019t they all.\u201d As his amusement faded, he slapped Aeron on the back. \u201cI think I miss a woman\u2019s softness most of all.\u201d</p><p>Thinking of Hadiee? \u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d Finally Aeron asked what he\u2019d wondered for centuries. \u201cWhy did you allow the Hunters to take your head?\u201d</p><p>His friend shrugged. \u201cI was tired, so tired of constantly looking over my shoulder, suspicious about anything and everything. I\u2019d even begun to doubt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of you, really.\u201d Baden sighed. \u201cI hated it. I hated that I expected each of you to turn on me when I knew in my heart that it would never happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. We never would have hurt you.\u201d They\u2019d loved this man too fiercely. Despite his demon, Baden had been the one each man relied on. The one each man sought for guidance and support.</p><p>\u201cAnd then the woman came,\u201d his friend continued. \u201cI suspected she was Bait, but what made it worse was that I hoped she was. So I did it. I escorted her home, let her seduce me, even though I knew the Hunters would show up. I was...relieved when they finally approached. I didn\u2019t even fight them.\u201d</p><p>Like he had ultimately refused to fight Lysander. \u201cAre you happy with the way things ended?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know. Pandora is all I have for amusement and as you saw, she isn\u2019t very amusing.\u201d</p><p>There was no denying that. \u201cSpeaking of Pandora, she seems to have disappeared. I\u2019ve caught no glimpse of her since I first arrived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way she works. She gives you a few days of peace, lulling you with a false sense of security, and then strikes. But enough of her. Why did you do it?\u201d Baden asked, flicking him a glance. \u201cWhy did you allow yourself to be killed? And yes, I know you allowed yourself to die. You\u2019re too good a soldier to have been taken any other way.\u201d</p><p>Aeron sighed, the weary sound a mimic of Baden\u2019s. \u201cAll these years I\u2019ve feared death, but there at the end, you\u2019re right. I, too, welcomed it. Not because I was tired but because I wanted to save my woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, a woman. The downfall of us all. Tell me about her. I have yet to be given a glimpse.\u201d Baden rubbed his hands together, ripe with anticipation. \u201cI want to know what kind of creature captivated so leery a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Aeron, I want to hear this, too.\u201d</p><p>Aeron stilled. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d He spun, gaze searching wildly for the woman he craved more than life. He found no sign of her.</p><p>\u201cI heard,\u201d Baden said, frowning now. \u201cA female voice, right?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t insane, then. \u201cOlivia?\u201d he shouted. He would have sworn his heart began pounding in his chest. \u201cOlivia!\u201d</p><p>Several yards away, the air began to shimmer, dappled glitter in a canvas of pearl, and a shape took form. Dark curls. Bright blue eyes. Flawless skin. Heart-shaped lips. Circles of rose painted her cheeks, and glorious white wings were stretched behind her.</p><p>Wings. Angel. She\u2019d gone home.</p><p>\u201cCan you see me?\u201d Desperate, he kicked into motion. \u201cCan you see the dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. I can see you.\u201d</p><p>When he reached her, his arms banded around her and lifted her up. He held on to her as he\u2019d never held on to another, spinning her. Here, she was here. With him. Never would he let her go.</p><p>Her head fell back and she laughed with carefree abandon. That laughter...how it soothed his soul.</p><p>\u201cOlivia.\u201d Desperate to taste her, he meshed their lips together. She opened willingly, eagerly, and he fed her kiss after kiss, savoring everything about her. The warmth of her body, the sweetness of her curves. His. And his alone.</p><p>\u201cAeron. There\u2019s so much I have to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Trembling, he set her down and cupped her face, never losing contact. \u201cSweetheart, what are you doing here? How are you here? And I see you\u2019re an angel once again.\u201d My angel.</p><p>\u201cYes. A joy-bringer, no longer a warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were always my joy-bringer, but how... I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>She beamed up at him and traced her fingers all over his face, as if she, too, couldn\u2019t bear to let go. \u201cMy Deity is the creator of life, and He has offered you a new one. Just as the Heavenly High Council offered me my old job back\u2014even though they say I\u2019m now better suited for the warrior class. From now on, I will be your personal joy-bringer. They realized you couldn\u2019t be happy without me, and I would have no joy without you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He still couldn\u2019t wrap his head around the details. \u201cWhy would they care? They were the ones who wanted me dead in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sacrificed everything. For me. My Deity acknowledged your sacrifice and sought to reward you. He will return you to your body, heal that body, and you may return to the fortress. We can be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTogether.\u201d He wanted to fall to his knees in thanks. He wanted to shout and to dance. He could only marvel. Olivia was his.</p> <p>Her gaze became questioning, unsure. \u201cAre you happy about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happier than I\u2019ve ever been, sweetheart. You are all I want, all I need.\u201d</p><p>Another smile bloomed. \u201cI feel the same.\u201d That smile dimmed somewhat. \u201cWrath...your demon cannot be returned to you, I\u2019m afraid. I tried. But he\u2019s been given to another already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman named Sienna Blackstone. Once a mortal, killed by gunshot. But Cronus saved her soul and has kept her with him.\u201d</p> <p>Paris\u2019s Sienna. Of all the outcomes... What did that mean for poor Paris? He could have his female back, after all, it seemed, but she would be crazed by Wrath for many years to come. She would exist only to exact vengeance upon those who sinned.</p><p>Aeron would do everything he could to ease her transition. And hopefully, the demon would recognize him. They still had a job to do, after all. Stefano\u2019s punishment. The demons who hurt her, too.</p><p>\u201cWill I be mortal?\u201d he asked. Not that he cared. He would be with Olivia. What did an aging body matter?</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019ll be immortal, just as before. In fact, your body will be restored to what it was at its creation. You will be without your tattoos, without your butterflies. Without your wings.\u201d Again she appeared unsure. \u201cIs that okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay? That is magnificent.\u201d Laughing now, he spun her a second time. Could life get any better? Maybe not. She didn\u2019t look as happy as she should have. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked as he stilled.</p><p>\u201cLegion. She\u2019s back in hell, bound once more to its flames because her bond to you was destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>Ice crystallized in his veins\u2014right along with realization. That\u2019s what Lysander had meant by the words \u201cshe will return home.\u201d He should have known, suspected at the very least.</p><p>\u201cLucifer is so angry with her, he\u2019s left her in her human body and the demons are tormenting her ceaselessly. Galen\u2019s looking for her, and I think...I think he\u2019ll even venture into hell for her. He wants to kill her because apparently she tried to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Aeron\u2019s eyes widened. Legion had tried to kill Galen? So much had happened since his passing. \u201cI can\u2019t leave her there,\u201d he said. Despite everything that had happened, he still loved the little demon.</p><p>\u201cI know. Which is why I\u2019ve spoken to the Council about my new duties. As your joy-bringer, I explained that you need the demon in your life or that life will not be complete. They have agreed that if you decide to go get her, they will let her stay with you, because what she is enduring now is a hell that will last her a thousand lifetimes. Upon her rescue, though, she will be assigned a guardian angel to ensure she harms no humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I accept for her.\u201d Legion hated angels, but she could deal. She\u2019d have to get used to his Olivia, anyway. \u201cYes,\u201d he said again. He didn\u2019t even have to think about it. \u201cYou, Olivia, are even more amazing than I realized. You did this, and I can never thank you enough.\u201d He rained little kisses all over her face. \u201cYou have given me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust as you have given me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will spend the rest of my days ensuring you have your fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I need is your love.\u201d</p> <p>Aeron dove in for another deep, penetrating kiss, and soon they were lost in it, their hands all over each other, eager, ready for more, determined\u2014</p><p>\u201cUh, guys.\u201d Baden\u2019s voice pushed through the illusion of privacy and both of them turned toward him. He waved at Olivia. \u201cHi. I hate to break this up, because wow, but what about me? I want in on this action. I want to go back to my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have made no sacrifice. I\u2019m afraid you have to remain here.\u201d</p><p>Regret and sorrow instantly tainted Aeron\u2019s newfound peace. He\u2019d only just found Baden, and now he was supposed to abandon him?</p><p>Baden\u2019s shoulders sagged. \u201cIs there anything\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Olivia interjected softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You are already dead. There\u2019s no sacrifice you can make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find a way to get you out,\u201d Aeron vowed. \u201cPandora mentioned the box. I\u2019ll never stop searching for it, I swear on my life.\u201d</p><p>His friend nodded, but there was sadness in his voice as he said, \u201cI will miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I you.\u201d Tears now burned his eyes.</p><p>Baden smiled, though even that was sad. \u201cTell Torin he owes me a sword. Tell Sabin I haven\u2019t forgotten how he cheated at chess. And tell Gideon I want a rematch. He\u2019ll know what you mean.\u201d He rattled off a message for every warrior, and damn if they didn\u2019t break Aeron\u2019s heart. By the end, his tears were flowing freely. \u201cUntil we meet again, Aeron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will. Meet again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never lose hope.\u201d Without another word, Baden walked backward, step by agonizing step. So badly Aeron wanted to shout for him to stop, but just as he opened his mouth to do so, unable to take the grief, the warrior disappeared in the mist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Olivia said, petting his chest.</p><p>Aeron jerked her back into his arms, grip tightening. \u201cThis is not the end. I swear it.\u201d He buried his face in the hollow of her neck. He could never repay her for all that she\u2019d done for him. \u201cI love you. So much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make you happy. Of all the things I\u2019ve sworn, that is the most important to me.\u201d</p><p>She pushed to her tiptoes and kissed him. \u201cYou already have made me happy. Now let\u2019s go home. There are lots of people eager to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, and I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but fly us to my bedroom. We need a proper reuniting. Then we\u2019ll meet with the others.\u201d</p><p>That earned him another laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I have wings now and you do not. Guess that means I\u2019m in charge of our more...illicit activities, too. So you can consider it done. Seeing to your happiness is my job, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor which I will be eternally grateful.\u201d</p><p>They kissed again before heading home. </p> </body></html>"]
