That\u2019s from Hamlet\u2019s\u2014maybe Shakespeare\u2019s\u2014most famous soliloquy. I had to memorize the whole speech for sophomore English, and I can still remember every word. I didn\u2019t give it much thought back then. I just wanted to get all the words right and collect my A. But what if Shakespeare\u2014and Hamlet\u2014were asking the wrong question? What if the real question is not whether to be, but how to be?</p><p>The thing is, I don\u2019t know if I would have asked myself that question\u2014how to be\u2014if it wasn\u2019t for Hamlet. Maybe I would have gone along being the Allyson Healey I had been. Doing just what I was supposed to do, which, in this case, was going to see Hamlet.</p><p>\u201cGod, it\u2019s so hot. I thought it wasn\u2019t supposed to get this hot in England.\u201d My friend Melanie loops her blond hair into a bun and fans her sweaty neck. \u201cWhat time are they opening the doors, anyhow?\u201d</p> <p>I look over at Ms. Foley, who Melanie and pretty much the rest of our group has christened Our Fearless Leader behind her back. But she is talking to Todd, one of the history grad students co-leading the trip, probably telling him off for something or other. In the Teen Tours! Cultural Extravaganza brochure that my parents presented to me upon my high school graduation two months ago, the Todd-like graduate students were called \u201chistorical consultants\u201d and were meant to bolster the \u201ceducational value\u201d of the Teen Tours! But so far, Todd has been more valuable in bolstering the hangovers, taking everyone out drinking almost every night. I\u2019m sure tonight everyone else will go extra wild. It is, after all, our last stop, Stratford-upon-Avon, a city full of Culture! Which seems to translate into a disproportionate number of pubs named after Shakespeare and frequented by people in blaring white sneakers.</p><p>Ms. Foley is wearing her own snow-white sneakers\u2014along with a pair of neatly pressed blue jeans and a Teen Tours! polo shirt\u2014as she reprimands Todd. Sometimes, at night, when everyone else is out on the town, she will tell me she ought to call the head office on him. But she never seems to follow through. I think partly because when she scolds, he flirts. Even with Ms. Foley. Especially with Ms. Foley.</p><p>\u201cI think it starts at seven,\u201d I say to Melanie. I look at my watch, another graduation present, thick gold, the back engraved Going Places. It weighs heavy against my sweaty wrist. \u201cIt\u2019s six thirty now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, the Brits do love to line up. Or queue. Or whatever. They should take a lesson from the Italians, who just mob. Or maybe the Italians should take a lesson from the Brits.\u201d Melanie tugs on her miniskirt\u2014her bandage skirt, she calls it\u2014and adjusts her cami-top. \u201cGod, Rome. It feels like a year ago.\u201d</p><p>Rome? Was it six days ago? Or sixteen? All of Europe has become a blur of airports, buses, old buildings, and prix-fixe menus serving chicken in various kinds of sauce. When my parents gave me this trip as a big high-school graduation present, I was a little reluctant to go. But Mom had reassured me that she\u2019d done her research. Teen Tours! was very well regarded, noted for its high-quality educational component, as well as the care that was taken of its students. I would be well looked after. \u201cYou\u2019ll never be alone,\u201d my parents had promised me. And, of course, Melanie was coming too.</p><p>And they were right. I know everyone else gives Ms. Foley crap for the eagle eye she keeps on us, but I appreciate how she is always doing a head count, even appreciate how she disapproves of the nightly jaunts to local bars, though most of us are of legal drinking age in Europe\u2014not that anyone over here seems to care about such things anyway.</p> <p>I don\u2019t go to the bars. I usually just go back to the hotel rooms Melanie and I share and watch TV. You can almost always find American movies, the same kinds of movies which, back at home, Melanie and I often watched together on weekends, in one of our rooms, with lots of popcorn.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m roasting out here,\u201d Melanie moans. \u201cIt\u2019s like middle of the afternoon still.\u201d</p><p>I look up. The sun is hot, and the clouds race across the sky. I like how fast they go, nothing in their way. You can tell from the sky that England\u2019s an island. \u201cAt least it\u2019s not pouring like it was when we got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a pony holder?\u201d Melanie asks. \u201cNo, of course you don\u2019t. I bet you\u2019re loving your hair now.\u201d</p><p>My hand drifts to the back of my neck, which still feels strange, oddly exposed. The Teen Tour! had begun in London, and on the second afternoon, we\u2019d had a few free hours for shopping, which I guess qualifies as culture. During that time, Melanie had convinced me to get my hair bobbed. It was all part of her precollege reinvention scheme, which she\u2019d explained to me on the flight over: \u201cNo one at college will know that we were AP automatons. I mean, we\u2019re too pretty to just be brainiacs, and at college, everyone will be smart. So we can be cool and smart. Those two things will no longer be mutually exclusive.\u201d</p><p>For Melanie, this reinvention apparently meant the new heavy-on-skimp wardrobe she\u2019d blown half her spending money on at Topshop, and the truncating of her name from Melanie to Mel\u2014something I can\u2019t quite remember to do, no matter how many times she kicks me under the table. For me, I guess it meant the haircut she talked me into.</p><p>I\u2019d freaked out when I\u2019d seen myself. I\u2019ve had long black hair and no bangs for as long as I can remember, and the girl staring back at me in the salon mirror didn\u2019t look like anything like me. At that point, we\u2019d only been gone two days, but my stomach went hollow with homesickness. I wanted to be back in my bedroom at home, with my familiar peach walls, my collection of vintage alarm clocks. I\u2019d wondered how I was ever going to handle college if I couldn\u2019t handle this.</p><p>But I\u2019ve gotten used to the hair, and the homesickness has mostly gone away, and even if it hasn\u2019t, the tour is ending. Tomorrow, almost everyone else is taking the coach straight to the airport to fly home. Melanie and I are catching a train down to London to stay with her cousin for three days. Melanie is talking about going back to the salon where I got my bob to get a pink streak in her hair, and we\u2019re going to see Let It Be in the West End. On Sunday, we fly home, and soon after that, we start college\u2014me near Boston, Melanie in New York.</p> <p>\u201cSet Shakespeare free!\u201d</p><p>I look up. A group of about a dozen people are coming up and down the line, handing out multicolored neon flyers. I can tell straightaway that they\u2019re not American\u2014no bright white tennis shoes or cargo shorts in sight. They are all impossibly tall, and thin, and different looking, somehow. It\u2019s like even their bone structure is foreign.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll take one of those.\u201d Melanie reaches out for a flyer and uses it to fan her neck.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it say?\u201d I ask her, looking at the group. Here in touristy Stratford-upon-Avon, they stand out like fire-orange poppies in a field of green.</p><p>Melanie looks at the flyer and wrinkles her nose. \u201cGuerrilla Will?\u201d</p><p>A girl with the kind of magenta streaks Melanie has been coveting comes up to us. \u201cIt\u2019s Shakespeare for the masses.\u201d</p><p>I peer at the card. It reads Guerrilla Will. Shakespeare Without Borders. Shakespeare Unleashed. Shakespeare For Free. Shakespeare For All.</p><p>\u201cShakespeare for free?\u201d Melanie reads.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d the magenta-haired girl says in accented English. \u201cNot for capitalist gain. How Shakespeare would\u2019ve wanted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he\u2019d want to actually sell tickets and make money from his plays?\u201d I\u2019m not trying to be a smart-ass, but I remember that movie Shakespeare in Love and how he was always owing money to somebody or other.</p><p>The girl rolls her eyes, and I start to feel foolish. I look down. A shadow falls over me, momentarily blocking out the glare of the sun. And then I hear laughter. I look up. I can\u2019t see the person in front of me because he\u2019s backlit by the still-bright evening sun. But I can hear him.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s right,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing a starving artist is not so romantic, maybe, when you\u2019re actually starving.\u201d</p><p>I blink a few times. My eyes adjust, and I see that the guy is tall, maybe a full foot taller than I am, and thin. His hair is a hundred shades of blond, and his eyes so brown as to almost be black. I have to tilt my head up to look at him, and he\u2019s tilting his head down to look at me.</p><p>\u201cBut Shakespeare is dead; he\u2019s not collecting royalties from the grave. And we, we are alive.\u201d He opens his arms, as if to embrace the universe. \u201cWhat are you seeing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHamlet,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAh, Hamlet.\u201d His accent is so slight as to be almost imperceptible. \u201cI think a night like this, you don\u2019t waste on tragedy.\u201d He looks at me, like it\u2019s a question. Then he smiles. \u201cOr indoors. We are doing Twelfth Night. Outside.\u201d He hands me a flyer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Melanie says in her coy voice.</p><p>The guy raises one shoulder and cocks his head toward it so his ear is almost touching his very angular shoulder blade. \u201cWhat you will,\u201d he says, though he\u2019s looking at me. Then he saunters off to join the rest of his troupe.</p><p>Melanie watches them go. \u201cWow, why are they not on the Teen Tours! Cultural Extravaganza? That\u2019s some culture I could get into!\u201d</p><p>I watch them leave, feeling a strange tug. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Hamlet before, you know.\u201d</p><p>Melanie looks at me, her eyebrows, which she has overly plucked into a thin line, raised. \u201cMe too. It was on TV, but still . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could go . . . to this. I mean, it would be different. A cultural experience, which is why our parents sent us on this tour.\u201d</p><p>Melanie laughs. \u201cLook at you, getting all bad! But what about Our Fearless Leader? It looks like she\u2019s gearing up for one of her head counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the heat was really bothering you . . . \u201d I begin.</p><p>Melanie looks at me for a second, then something clicks. She licks her lips, grins, and then crosses her eyes. \u201cOh, yeah. I totally have heatstroke.\u201d She turns to Paula, who\u2019s from Maine and is studiously reading a Fodor\u2019s guide. \u201cPaula, I\u2019m feeling so dizzy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s way hot,\u201d Paula says, nodding sympathetically. \u201cYou should hydrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I might faint or something. I\u2019m seeing black spots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pile it on,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to build a case,\u201d Melanie whispers, enjoying this now. \u201cOh, I think I\u2019m going to pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Foley,\u201d I call.</p><p>Ms. Foley looks up from ticking names off her roll-call sheet. She comes over, her face so full of concern, I feel bad for lying. \u201cI think Melanie, I mean Mel, is getting heatstroke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you poorly? It shouldn\u2019t be much longer now. And it\u2019s lovely and cool inside the theater.\u201d Ms. Foley speaks in a strange hybrid of Britishisms with a Midwestern accent that everyone makes fun of because they think it\u2019s pretentious. But I think it\u2019s just that she\u2019s from Michigan and spends a lot of time in Europe.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to puke.\u201d Melanie pushes on. \u201cI would hate to do that inside the Swan Theatre.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Foley\u2019s face wrinkles in displeasure, though I can\u2019t tell if it is from the idea of Melanie barfing inside the Swan or using the word puke in such close proximity to the Royal Shakespeare Company. \u201cOh, dear. I\u2019d better escort you back to the hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take her,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cReally? Oh, no. I couldn\u2019t. You should see Hamlet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll take her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! It\u2019s my responsibility to take her. I simply couldn\u2019t burden you like that.\u201d I can see the argument she\u2019s having with herself play out over her pinched features. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Ms. Foley. I\u2019ve seen Hamlet before, and the hotel is just over the square from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Oh, that would be lovely. Would you believe in all the years I\u2019ve been doing this, I have never seen the Bard\u2019s Hamlet done by the RSC?\u201d</p><p>Melanie gives a little moan for dramatic effect. I gently elbow her. I smile at Ms. Foley. \u201cWell, then, you definitely shouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>She nods solemnly, as though we are discussing important business here, order of succession to the throne or something. Then she reaches for my hand. \u201cIt has been such a pleasure traveling with you, Allyson. I shall miss you. If only more young people today were like you. You are such a . . .\u201d She pauses for a moment, searching for the right word. \u201cSuch a good girl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say automatically. But her compliment leaves me empty. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because that\u2019s the nicest thing she could think to say about me, or if it\u2019s because I\u2019m not being such a good girl right now.</p><p>\u201cGood girl, my ass.\u201d Melanie laughs once we are clear of the queue and she can give up her swooning act.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet. I don\u2019t like pretending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re awfully good at it. You could have a promising acting career of your own, if you ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t ask you. Now, where is this place?\u201d I look at the flyer. \u201cCanal Basin? What is that?\u201d</p> <p>Melanie pulls out her phone, which, unlike my cell phone, works in Europe. She opens the map app. \u201cIt appears to be a basin by the canal.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later, we arrive at a waterfront. It feels like a carnival, full of people hanging about. There are barges moored to the side of the water, different boats selling everything from ice cream to paintings. What there isn\u2019t is any kind of theater. Or stage. Or chairs. Or actors. I look at the flyer again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s on the bridge?\u201d Melanie asks.</p><p>We walk back over to the medieval arched bridge, but it\u2019s just more of the same: tourists like us, milling around in the hot night.</p><p>\u201cThey did say it was tonight?\u201d Melanie asks.</p><p>I think of that one guy, his eyes so impossibly dark, specifically saying that tonight was too nice for tragedy. But when I look around, there\u2019s no play here, obviously. It was probably some kind of joke\u2014fool the stupid tourist.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s get an ice cream so the night\u2019s not a total write-off,\u201d I say.</p><p>We are queuing up for ice cream when we hear it, a hum of acoustic guitars and the echoey beat of bongo drums. My ears perk up, my sonar rises. I stand on a nearby bench to look around. It\u2019s not like a stage has magically appeared, but what has just materialized is a crowd, a pretty big one, under a stand of trees.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s starting,\u201d I say, grabbing Melanie\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cBut the ice cream,\u201d she complains.</p><p>\u201cAfter,\u201d I say, yanking her toward the crowd.</p><p>\u201cIf music be the food of love, play on.\u201d</p><p>The guy playing Duke Orsino looks nothing like any Shakespearian actor I\u2019ve ever seen, except maybe the movie version of Romeo + Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio. He is tall, black, dreadlocked, and dressed like a glam rock-star in tight vinyl pants, pointy-toed shoes, and a sort of mesh tank top that shows off his ripped chest.</p><p>\u201cOh, we so made the right choice,\u201d Melanie whispers in my ear.</p> <p>As Orsino gives his opening soliloquy to the sounds of the guitars and bongo drums, I feel a shiver go up my spine.</p><p>We watch the entire first act, chasing the actors around the waterfront. When they move, we move, which makes it feel like we are a part of the play. And maybe that\u2019s what makes it so different. Because I\u2019ve seen Shakespeare before. School productions and a few plays at the Philadelphia Shakespeare Theatre. But it\u2019s always felt like listening to something in a foreign language I didn\u2019t know that well. I had to force myself to pay attention, and half the time, I wound up rereading the program over and over again, as if it would impart some deeper understanding.</p><p>This time, it clicks. It\u2019s like my ear attunes to the weird language and I\u2019m sucked fully into the story, the same way I am when I watch a movie, so that I feel it. When Orsino pines for the cool Olivia, I feel that pang in my gut from all the times I\u2019ve crushed on guys I was invisible to. And when Viola mourns her brother, I feel her loneliness. And when she falls for Orsino, who thinks she\u2019s a man, it\u2019s actually funny and also moving.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t show up until act two. He\u2019s playing Sebastian, Viola\u2019s twin brother, thought dead. Which makes a certain sense, because by the time he does arrive, I am beginning to think he never really existed, that I\u2019ve merely conjured him.</p><p>As he races through the green, chased after by the ever-loyal Antonio, we chase after him. After a while, I work up my nerve. \u201cLet\u2019s get closer,\u201d I say to Melanie. She grabs my hand, and we go to the front of the crowd right at the part where Olivia\u2019s clown comes for Sebastian and they argue before Sebastian sends him away. Right before he does, he seems to catch my eye for half a second.</p><p>As the hot day softens into twilight and I\u2019m sucked deeper into the illusory world of Illyria, I feel like I\u2019ve entered some weird otherworldly space, where anything can happen, where identities can be swapped like shoes. Where those thought dead are alive again. Where everyone gets their happily-ever-afters. I recognize it\u2019s kind of corny, but the air is soft and warm, and the trees are lush and full, and the crickets are singing, and it seems like, for once, maybe it can happen.</p><p>All too soon, the play is ending. Sebastian and Viola are reunited. Viola comes clean to Orsino that she\u2019s actually a girl, and of course he now wants to marry her. And Olivia realizes that Sebastian isn\u2019t the person she thought she married\u2014but she doesn\u2019t care; she loves him anyway. The musicians are playing again as the clown gives the final soliloquy. And then the actors are out and bowing, each one doing something a little silly with his or her bow. One flips. One plays air guitar. When Sebastian bows, he scans the audience and stops dead on me. He smiles this funny little half smile, takes one of the prop coins out of his pocket, and flips it to me. It\u2019s pretty dark, and the coin is small, but I catch it, and people clap for me too, it now seems.</p><p>With the coin in my hand, I clap. I clap until my hands sting. I clap as if doing so can prolong the evening, can transform Twelfth Night into Twenty-Fourth Night. I clap so that I can hold on to this feeling. I clap because I know what will happen when I stop. It\u2019s the same thing that happens when I turn off a really good movie\u2014one that I\u2019ve lost myself to\u2014which is that I\u2019ll be thrown back to my own reality and something hollow will settle in my chest. Sometimes, I\u2019ll watch a movie all over again just to recapture that feeling of being inside something real. Which, I know, doesn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>But there\u2019s no restarting tonight. The crowd is dispersing; the actors drifting off. The only people left from the show are a couple of musicians passing around the donation hat. I reach into my wallet for a ten-pound note.</p><p>Melanie and I stand together in silence. \u201cWhoa,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Whoa,\u201d I say back.</p><p>\u201cThat was pretty cool. And I hate Shakespeare.\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd was it me, or was that hot guy from the line earlier, the one who played Sebastian, was he totally checking us out?\u201d</p><p>Us? But he threw me the coin. Or had I just been the one to catch it? Why wouldn\u2019t it have been Melanie with her blond hair and her camisole top that he\u2019d been checking out? Mel 2.0, as she calls herself, so much more appealing than Allyson 1.0.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t tell,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cAnd he threw the coin at us! Nice catch, by the way. Maybe we should go find them. Go hang out with them or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but those guys are still here.\u201d She gestures to the money collectors. \u201cWe could ask where they hang out.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI doubt they want to hang out with stupid American teenagers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not stupid, and most of them didn\u2019t seem that much older than teenagers themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And besides, Ms. Foley might check in on us. We should get back to the room.\u201d</p><p>Melanie rolls her eyes. \u201cWhy do you always do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no to everything. It\u2019s like you\u2019re averse to adventure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t always say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine times out of ten. We\u2019re about to start college. Let\u2019s live a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live just plenty,\u201d I snap. \u201cAnd besides, it never bothered you before.\u201d</p><p>Melanie and I have been best friends since her family moved two houses down from ours the summer before second grade. Since then, we\u2019ve done everything together: we lost our teeth at the same time, we got our periods at the same time, even our boyfriends came in tandem. I started going out with Evan a few weeks after she started going out with Alex (who was Evan\u2019s best friend), though she and Alex broke up in January and Evan and I made it until April.</p><p>We\u2019ve spent so much time together, we almost have a secret language of inside jokes and looks. We\u2019ve fought plenty, of course. We\u2019re both only children, so sometimes we\u2019re like sisters. We once even broke a lamp in a tussle. But it\u2019s never been like this. I\u2019m not even sure what this is, only that since we got on the tour, being with Melanie makes me feel like I\u2019m losing a race I didn\u2019t even know I\u2019d entered.</p><p>\u201cI came out here tonight,\u201d I say, my voice brittle and defensive. \u201cI lied to Ms. Foley so we could come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight? And we\u2019ve had so much fun! So why don\u2019t we keep it going?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>She shuffles through her bag and pulls out her phone, scrolls through her texts. \u201cHamlet just let out too. Craig says that Todd\u2019s taken the gang to a pub called the Dirty Duck. I like the sound of that. Come out with us. It\u2019ll be a blast.\u201d</p><p>The thing is, I did go out with Melanie and everyone from the tour once, about a week into the trip. By this time, they\u2019d already gone out a couple times. And even though Melanie had known these guys only a week\u2014the same amount of time I\u2019d known them\u2014she had all these inside jokes with them, jokes I didn\u2019t understand. I\u2019d sat there around the crowded table, nursing a drink, feeling like the unlucky kid who had to start a new school midway into the year.</p><p>I look at my watch, which has slid all the way down my wrist. I slide it back up, so it covers the ugly red birthmark right on my pulse. \u201cIt\u2019s almost eleven, and we have to be up early tomorrow for our train. So if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to take my adventure-averse self back to the room.\u201d With the huffiness in my voice, I sound just like my mom.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll walk you back and then go to the pub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what if Ms. Foley checks in on us?\u201d</p><p>Melanie laughs. \u201cTell her I had heatstroke. And it\u2019s not hot anymore.\u201d She starts to walk up the slope back toward the bridge. \u201cWhat? Are you waiting for something?\u201d</p><p>I look back down toward the water, the barges, now emptying out from the evening rush. Trash collectors are out in force. The day is ending; it\u2019s not coming back.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>Our train to London is at eight fifteen\u2014Melanie\u2019s idea, so we will have maximum shopping time. But when the alarm clock starts beeping at six, Melanie pulls the pillow over her head.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get a later train,\u201d she moans.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s already all arranged. You can sleep on the train. Anyway, you promised to be downstairs at six thirty to say good-bye to everyone.\u201d And I promised to say good-bye to Ms. Foley.</p><p>I drag Melanie out of bed and shove her under the hotel\u2019s weak excuse for a shower. I brew her some instant coffee and quickly talk to my mom, who stayed up until one in the morning Pennsylvania time to call. At six thirty, we trudge downstairs. Ms. Foley, in her jeans and Teen Tours! polo shirt as usual, shakes Melanie\u2019s hand. Then she embraces me in a bony hug, slips me her business card, and says I shouldn\u2019t hesitate to call if I need anything while in London. Her next tour starts on Sunday, and she\u2019ll be there too until it begins. Then she tells me she\u2019s arranged a seven-thirty taxi to take me and Melanie to the train station, asks once again if we\u2019re being met in London (yes, we are), tells me yet again that I\u2019m a good girl, and warns me against pickpockets on the Tube. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I let Melanie go back to bed for another half hour, which means she skips her usual primp time, and at seven thirty I load us into the waiting taxi. When our train arrives, I drag our bags onto it and find a pair of empty seats. Melanie slumps into the one next to the window. \u201cWake me when we get to London.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her for a second, but she\u2019s already snuggled up against the window, shutting her eyes. I sigh and stow her shoulder bag under her feet and put my cardigan down on the seat next to hers to discourage any thieves or lecherous old men. Then I make my way to the caf\u00e9 car. I missed the hotel\u2019s breakfast, and now my stomach is growling and my temples are starting to throb with the beginnings of a hunger headache.</p><p>Even though Europe is the land of trains, we haven\u2019t taken any on the tour, only airplanes for the long distances and buses to get us everywhere in between. As I walk through the cars, the automatic doors open with a satisfying whoosh, and the train rocks gently under my feet. Outside, the green countryside whizzes by.</p><p>In the caf\u00e9 car, I examine the sad offerings and wind up ordering a cheese sandwich and tea and the salt and vinegar crisps I\u2019ve become addicted to. I get a can of Coke for Melanie. I put the meal in one of those cardboard carriers and am about to go back to my seat when one of the tables right next to the window opens up. I hesitate for a second. I should get back to Melanie. Then again, she\u2019s asleep; she doesn\u2019t care, so I sit at the table and stare out the window. The countryside seems so fundamentally English, all green and tidy and divvied up with hedges, the fluffy sheep like clouds mirroring the ever-present ones in the sky.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very confused breakfast.\u201d</p><p>That voice. After listening to it for four acts last night, I recognize it immediately.</p><p>I look up, and he\u2019s right there, grinning a sort of lazy half smile that makes him seem like he just this second woke up.</p><p>\u201cHow is it confused?\u201d I ask. I should be surprised, but somehow, I\u2019m not. I do have to bite my lip to keep from grinning.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t answer. He goes to the counter and orders a coffee. Then he gestures with his head toward my table. I nod.</p> <p>\u201cIn so many ways,\u201d he says, sitting down opposite me. \u201cIt is like a jet-lagged expatriate.\u201d</p><p>I look down at my sandwich, my tea, my chips. \u201cThis is a jet-lagged expatriate? How do you get that from this?\u201d</p><p>He blows on his coffee. \u201cEasy. For one, it\u2019s not even nine in the morning. So tea makes sense. But sandwich and crisps. Those are lunch foods. I won\u2019t even mention the Coke.\u201d He taps the can. \u201cSee, the timing is all mixed up. Your breakfast has jet lag.\u201d</p><p>I have to laugh at that. \u201cThe doughnuts looked disgusting.\u201d I gesture toward the counter.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. That\u2019s why I bring my own breakfast.\u201d He reaches into his bag and starts unwrapping something from a wrinkled piece of waxed paper.</p><p>\u201cWait, that looks suspiciously like a sandwich too,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not, really. It\u2019s bread and hagelslag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHachuh what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHach-el-slach.\u201d He opens the sandwich for me to see. Inside is butter and some kind of chocolate sprinkles.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re calling my breakfast confused? You\u2019re eating dessert for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Holland, this is breakfast. Very typical. That or uitsmijter, which is basically fried egg with ham.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be on the test, will it? Because I can\u2019t even begin to try to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut. Smy. Ter. We can practice that later. But that brings me to my second point. Your breakfast is like an expatriate. And, go ahead, eat. I can talk while you eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m glad you can multitask,\u201d I say. Then I laugh. And it\u2019s all just the weirdest thing, because this is just happening, so naturally. I think I am actually flirting, over breakfast. About breakfast. \u201cWhat do you even mean, an expatriate?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomeone who lives outside of their native country. You know, you have a sandwich. Very American. And the tea, very English. But then you have the crisps, or chips, or whatever you want to call them, and they can go either way, but you\u2019re having salt and vinegar, which is very English, but you\u2019re eating them for breakfast, and that seems American. And Coke for breakfast. Coke and chips, is that what you eat for breakfast in America?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you even know I\u2019m from America?\u201d I challenge.</p><p>\u201cAside from the fact that you were in a tour group of Americans and you speak with an American accent?\u201d He takes a bite of his hagu-whatever sandwich and drinks more of his coffee.</p><p>I bite my lip to keep from grinning again. \u201cRight. Aside from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose were the only clues, really. You actually don\u2019t look so American.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I pop open my crisps, and a sharp tang of artificial vinegar wafts through the air. I offer him one. He declines it and takes another bite of his sandwich. \u201cWhat looks American?\u201d</p><p>He shrugs. \u201cBlond,\u201d he says. \u201cBig . . .\u201d He mimes boobs. \u201cSoft features.\u201d He waves his hands in front of his face. \u201cPretty. Like your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t look that way?\u201d I don\u2019t know why I bother to ask this. I know what I look like. Dark hair. Dark eyes. Sharp features. No curves, not much in the boob department. A little of the fizz goes out of my step. Was all this just buttering me up so he could hit on Melanie?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He peers at me with those eyes of his. They\u2019d looked so dark yesterday, but now that I\u2019m up close, I can see that they have all kinds of colors in them\u2014gray, brown, even gold dancing in the darkness. \u201cYou know who you look like? Louise Brooks.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him blankly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know her? The silent film star?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. I never did get into silent films.</p><p>\u201cShe was a huge star in the nineteen twenties. American. Amazing actress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd not blond.\u201d I mean for it to come out as a joke, but it doesn\u2019t.</p><p>He takes another bite of his sandwich. A tiny chocolate sprinkle sticks to the corner of his mouth. \u201cWe have lots of blondes in Holland. I see blond when I look in a mirror. Louise Brooks was dark. She had these incredible sad eyes and very defined features and the same hair like you.\u201d He touches his own hair, as tousled as it was last night. \u201cYou look so much like her. I should just call you Louise.\u201d</p><p>Louise. I like that.</p><p>\u201cNo, not Louise. Lulu. That was her nickname.\u201d</p><p>Lulu. I like that even better.</p><p>He reaches out his hand. \u201cHi, Lulu, I\u2019m Willem.\u201d</p><p>His hand is warm, and his grasp is firm. \u201cNice to meet you, Willem. Though I could call you Sebastian if we\u2019re taking on new identities.\u201d</p><p>When he laughs, little crinkles flower along his eyes. \u201cNo. I prefer Willem. Sebastian\u2019s kind of, what\u2019s the word . . . passive, when you think about it. He gets married to Olivia, who really wants to be with his sister. That happens a lot with Shakespeare. The women go after what they want; the men wind up suckered into things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was glad when everyone got their happy ending last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s a nice fairy tale, but that\u2019s what it is. A fairy tale. But I figure Shakespeare owes his comedy characters those happy endings because he is so cruel in his tragedies. I mean, Hamlet. Or Romeo and Juliet. It\u2019s almost sadistic.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cSebastian\u2019s okay, he\u2019s just not really in charge of his own destiny so much. Shakespeare gives that privilege to Viola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re in charge of your own destiny?\u201d I ask. And again, I hear myself and can hardly believe it. When I was little, I used to go to the local ice-skating rink. In my mind, I always felt like I could twirl and jump, but when I got out onto the ice, I could barely keep my blades straight. When I got older, that\u2019s how it was with people: In my mind, I am bold and forthright, but what comes out always seems to be so meek and polite. Even with Evan, my boyfriend for junior and most of senior year, I never quite managed to be that skating, twirling, leaping person I suspected I could be. But today, apparently, I can skate.</p><p>\u201cOh, not at all. I go where the wind blows me.\u201d He pauses to consider that. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a good reason I play Sebastian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where is the wind blowing you?\u201d I ask, hoping he\u2019s staying in London.</p><p>\u201cFrom London, I catch another train back to Holland. Last night was the end of the season for me.\u201d</p><p>I deflate. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten your sandwich. Be warned, they put butter on the cheese sandwiches here. The fake kind, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I pull off the sad wilted tomatoes and smear off some of the excess butter/margarine with my napkin.</p><p>\u201cIt would be better with mayonnaise,\u201d Willem tells me.</p><p>\u201cOnly if there was turkey on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, cheese and mayonnaise is very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds foul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019ve never had the proper sort of mayonnaise. I\u2019ve heard the kind they have in America is not the proper sort.\u201d</p><p>I laugh so hard that tea comes spurting out my nose.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Willem asks. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe proper sort of mayonnaise,\u201d I say in between gasps of laughter. \u201cIt makes me think that there\u2019s, like, a bad-girl mayonnaise who\u2019s slutty and steals, and a good-girl mayonnaise, who is proper and crosses her legs, and my problem is that I\u2019ve never been introduced to the right one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is exactly correct,\u201d he says. And then he starts laughing too.</p><p>We are both cracking up when Melanie trudges into the caf\u00e9 car, carrying her stuff, plus my sweater. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find you,\u201d she says sullenly.</p><p>\u201cYou said to wake you in London.\u201d I look out the window then. The pretty English countryside has given way to the ugly gray outskirts of the city.</p><p>Melanie looks over at Willem, and her eyes widen. \u201cYou\u2019re not shipwrecked after all,\u201d she says to him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he says, but he\u2019s looking at me. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad at Lulu. It\u2019s my fault. I kept her here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLulu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, short for Louise. It\u2019s my new alter ego, Mel.\u201d I look at her, my eyes imploring her not to give me away. I\u2019m liking being Lulu. I\u2019m not ready to give her up just yet.</p><p>Melanie rubs her eyes, like maybe she\u2019s still sleeping. Then she shrugs and slumps into the seat next to Willem. \u201cFine. Be whoever you want. I\u2019d like to be someone with a new head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s new to this hangover thing,\u201d I tell Willem.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Melanie snaps.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you want me say that \u2018it\u2019s old hat for you\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you Miss Sassy-pants this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Willem reaches into his backpack for a small white container and shakes out a few white balls into Melanie\u2019s hand. \u201cPut these under your tongue to dissolve. You\u2019ll feel better soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asks suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s herbal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s not some date-rape drug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Because he wants you to pass out in the middle of the train,\u201d I say.</p><p>Willem shows the label to Melanie. \u201cMy mother is a naturopathic doctor. She uses these for headaches. I don\u2019t think to rape me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, my father is a doctor too,\u201d I say. Though the opposite of naturopathic. He\u2019s a pulmonologist, Western medicine all the way.</p><p>Melanie eyes the pills for a second before finally popping them under her tongue. By the time the train chugs into the station ten minutes later, her headache is better.</p><p>By some unspoken agreement, the three of us disembark together: Melanie and I with our overstuffed roller bags, Willem with his compact backpack. We push out onto the platform into the already-hot summer sun and then into the relative cool of Marylebone Station. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cVeronica texted that she\u2019s running late,\u201d Melanie says. \u201cShe says to meet her by the WHSmith. Whatever that is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bookstore,\u201d Willem says, pointing across the interior of the station.</p><p>The inside of the station is pretty and redbricked, but I\u2019m disappointed that it\u2019s not one of those grand stations with the clattering destination boards I was hoping for. Instead, there\u2019s just a TV departure monitor. I go over to look at it. The destinations are nowhere that exotic: places like High Wycombe and Banbury, which might be very nice for all I know. It\u2019s silly, really. I\u2019ve just finished up a tour of big European cities\u2014Rome, Florence, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Berlin, Edinburgh, and now I\u2019m in London again\u2014and for most of it, I was counting the days until we went home. I don\u2019t know why now all of a sudden I should be struck with wanderlust.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Melanie asks me.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I was just hoping for one of those big departure boards, like they had at some of the airports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmsterdam\u2019s Centraal Station has one of those,\u201d Willem says. \u201cI always like to stand in front of it and just imagine I can pick any place and go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight? Exactly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Melanie asks, looking at the TV monitors. \u201cDon\u2019t like the idea of Bicester North?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not quite as exciting as Paris,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cOh, come on. You\u2019re not still moping about that?\u201d Melanie turns to Willem. \u201cWe were supposed to go to Paris after Rome, but the air traffic controllers went on strike and all the flights got canceled, and it was too far to go on the bus. She\u2019s still bummed out about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re always on strike for something in France,\u201d Willem says, nodding his head.</p><p>\u201cThey subbed Budapest in for Paris,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd I liked Budapest, but I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m this close to Paris and not going.\u201d</p><p>Willem looks at me intently. He twists the tie on his backpack around his finger. \u201cSo go,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cGo where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Paris.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t. It got canceled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tour\u2019s over. And anyhow, they\u2019re probably still striking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can go by train. It takes two hours from London to Paris.\u201d He looks at the big clock on the wall. \u201cYou could be in Paris by lunchtime. Much better sandwiches over there, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, but, I don\u2019t speak French. I don\u2019t have a guidebook. I don\u2019t even have any French money. They use euros there, right?\u201d I\u2019m giving all these reasons as if these are why I can\u2019t go, when in truth, Willem might as well be suggesting I hop a rocket to the moon. I know Europe is small and some people do things like this. But I don\u2019t.</p><p>He\u2019s still looking at me, his head tilted slightly to the side.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d I conclude. \u201cI don\u2019t know Paris at all.\u201d</p><p>Willem glances at the clock on the wall. And then, after a beat, he turns to me. \u201cI know Paris.\u201d</p> <p>My heart starts doing the most ridiculous flippy things, but my ever-rational mind continues to click off all the reasons this won\u2019t work. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I have enough money. How much are the tickets?\u201d I reach into my bag to count my remaining cash. I have some pounds to get me through the weekend, a credit card for emergencies, and a hundred-dollar bill that Mom gave me for absolute emergencies if the credit card wouldn\u2019t work. But this is hardly an emergency. And using the card would alert my parents.</p><p>Willem reaches into his pocket, pulls out a fistful of foreign currencies. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. It was a good summer.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the bills in his hand. Would he really do that? Take me to Paris? Why would he do that?</p><p>\u201cWe have tickets for Let It Be tomorrow night,\u201d Melanie says, assuming the Voice of Reason. \u201cAnd we\u2019re leaving on Sunday. And your mom would freak out. Seriously, she\u2019d kill you.\u201d</p><p>I look at Willem, but he just shrugs, like he cannot deny the truth to this.</p><p>And I\u2019m about to back down, say thanks for the offer, but then it\u2019s like Lulu grabs the wheel, because I turn to Melanie and say, \u201cShe can\u2019t kill me if she doesn\u2019t find out.\u201d</p><p>Melanie\u2019s scoffs. \u201cYour mom? She\u2019d find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you covered for me.\u201d</p><p>Melanie doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019ve covered for you plenty on this trip.\u201d</p><p>Melanie sighs dramatically. \u201cThat was at a pub. Not in an entirely different country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just criticized me for never doing things like this.\u201d</p><p>I have her there. She switches tacks. \u201cHow am I supposed to cover when she calls my phone looking for you? Which she\u2019ll do. You know she will.\u201d</p><p>Mom had been furious that my cell phone didn\u2019t work over here. We\u2019d been told it would, and when it didn\u2019t, she called the company up in a tizzy, but apparently there was nothing to be done, something about it being the wrong band. It didn\u2019t really matter in the end. She had a copy of our itinerary and knew when to get me in the hotel rooms, and when she couldn\u2019t manage that, she called Melanie\u2019s cell.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could leave your phone off, so it goes to voice mail?\u201d I suggest. I look at Willem, who still has the fistful of cash spilling out of his hand. \u201cAre you sure about this? I thought you were going back to Holland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so too. The winds are maybe blowing me in a different direction.\u201d</p><p>I turn to Melanie. It\u2019s on her now. She narrows her green eyes at Willem. \u201cIf you rape or murder my friend, I will kill you.\u201d</p><p>Willem tsk-tsks. \u201cYou Americans are so violent. I\u2019m Dutch. The worst I will do is run her over with a bicycle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile stoned!\u201d Melanie adds.</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe there\u2019s that,\u201d Willem admits. Then he looks at me, and I feel a ripple of something flutter through me. Am I really going to do this?</p><p>\u201cSo, Lulu? What do you say? You want to go to Paris? For just one day?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s totally crazy. I don\u2019t even know him. And I could get caught. And how much of Paris can you see in just one day? And this could all go disastrously wrong in so many ways. All of that is true. I know it is. But it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I want to go.</p><p>So this time, instead of saying no, I try something different.</p><p>I say yes.</p><p>Three</p><p>The Eurostar is a snub-nosed, mud-splattered, yellow train, and by the time we board it, I am sweaty and breathless. Since saying good-bye to Melanie and hastily exchanging plans and info and meeting places for tomorrow, Willem and I have been running. Out of Marylebone. Down the crowded London streets and into the Tube, where I got into some sort of duel with the gates, which refused to open for me three times, then finally did, before snapping shut on my suitcase, sending my Teen Tours! baggage tag flying underneath the automatic ticket machine. \u201cI guess I\u2019m really going rogue now,\u201d I joked to Willem.</p><p>At the cavernous St. Pancras station, Willem pointed out the destination boards doing that shuffling thing before hustling us to the Eurostar ticket lines, where he worked his charm on the ticket agent and managed to exchange his ticket home for a ticket to Paris and then used far too many of his pound notes to buy me mine. Then we rushed through the check-in process, showing our passports. For a second, I was worried that Willem would see my passport, which doesn\u2019t belong to Lulu so much as to Allyson\u2014not just Allyson, but fifteen-year-old Allyson in the midst of some acne issues. But he didn\u2019t, and we went downstairs to the futuristic departure lounge just in time to go back upstairs to our train.</p><p>It\u2019s only once we sit down in our assigned seats on the train that I catch my breath and realize what I\u2019ve done. I am going to Paris. With a stranger. With this stranger.</p><p>I pretend to fuss with my suitcase while I steal looks at him. His face reminds me of one of those outfits that only girls with a certain style can pull off: mismatched pieces that don\u2019t work on their own but somehow all come together. The angles are deep, almost sharp, but his lips are pillowy and red, and there are enough apples in his cheeks to make pie. He looks both old and young; both grizzled and delicate. He\u2019s not good-looking in the way that Brent Harper, who was voted Best Looking in the senior awards, is which is to say predictably so. But I can\u2019t stop looking at him.</p><p>Apparently I\u2019m not the only one. A couple of girls with backpacks stroll down the aisle, their eyes dark and drowsy and seeming to say, We eat sex for breakfast. One of them smiles at Willem as she passes and says something in French. He replies, also in French, and helps her lift her bag into the overhead bin. The girls sit across the aisle, a row behind ours, and the shorter one says something, and they all laugh. I want to ask what was said, but all at once, I feel incredibly young and out of place, stuck at the children\u2019s table for Thanksgiving.</p><p>If only I\u2019d studied French in high school. I\u2019d wanted to, at the start of ninth grade, but my parents had urged me to take Mandarin. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the Chinese century; you\u2019ll be so much better able to compete if you speak the language,\u201d Mom had said. Compete for what? I\u2019d wondered. But I\u2019ve studied Mandarin for the last four years and am due to continue next month when I start college.</p><p>I\u2019m waiting for Willem to sit down, but instead he looks at me and then at the French girls, who, having deposited their things, are sashaying down the aisle.</p><p>\u201cTrains make me hungry. And you never ate your sandwich,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the caf\u00e9 for more provisions. What would you like, Lulu?\u201d</p><p>Lulu would probably want something exotic. Chocolate-covered strawberries. Oysters. Allyson is more of a peanut-butter-sandwich girl. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m hungry for.</p><p>\u201cWhatever is fine.\u201d</p><p>I watch him walk away. I pick up a magazine from the seat pocket and read a bunch of facts about the train: The Channel Tunnel is fifty kilometers long. It opened in 1994 and took six years to complete. The Eurostar\u2019s top speeds are three hundred kilometers per hour, which is one hundred and eighty-six miles per hour. If I were still on the tour, this would be exactly the kind of Trivial-Pursuit fodder Ms. Foley would read to us from one of her printouts. I put the magazine away.</p><p>The train starts to move, though it\u2019s so smooth that it\u2019s only when I see the platform is pulling away from us, as though it\u2019s moving, not the train, that I realize we\u2019ve departed. I hear the horn blow. Out the window, the grand arches of St. Pancras glitter their farewell before we plunge into a tunnel. I look around the car. Everyone else seems happy and engaged: reading magazines or typing on laptops, texting, talking on their phones or to their seatmates. I peer over my seat back, but there is no sign of Willem. The French girls are still gone too.</p><p>I pick up the magazine again and read a restaurant review that I don\u2019t absorb at all. More minutes tick by. The train is going faster now, arrogantly bypassing London\u2019s ugly warehouses. The conductor announces the first stop, and an inspector comes through to take my ticket. \u201cAnyone here?\u201d he asks, gesturing to Willem\u2019s empty seat.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Only his things aren\u2019t there. There\u2019s no evidence he ever was here.</p><p>I glance at my watch. It\u2019s ten forty-three. Almost fifteen minutes since we left London. A few minutes later, we pull into Ebbsfleet, a sleek, modern station. A crowd of people get on. An older man with a briefcase stops next to Willem\u2019s seat as if to sit there, but then he glances at his ticket again and keeps moving up the aisle. The train doors beep and then shut, and we are off again. The London cityscape gives way to green. In the distance, I see a castle. The train greedily gobbles up the landscape; I imagine it leaving a churned-up pile of earth in its wake. I grip the armrests, my nails digging in as if this were that first endlessly steep incline up one of those lunch-losing roller coasters that Melanie loves to drag me on. In spite of the blasting AC, a line of perspiration pearls along my brow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Our train passes another oncoming train with a startling whoomp. I jump in my seat. After two seconds, the train is speeding past us. But I have the weirdest sensation that Willem is on it. Which is impossible. He would\u2019ve had to fast-forward to another station to get that train.</p><p>But that\u2019s not to say he\u2019s on this train.</p><p>I look at my watch. It\u2019s been twenty minutes since he went to the caf\u00e9 car. Our train had not yet left the platform. He might\u2019ve gotten off with those girls even before we departed. Or at this last station. Maybe that\u2019s what they were saying. Why don\u2019t you ditch that boring American girl and hang out with us?</p><p>He is not on this train.</p> <p>The certainty hits me with that same whoomp as the oncoming train. He changed his mind. About Paris. About me.</p><p>Taking me to Paris was an impulse buy, like all those useless gadgets grocery stores put at the checkout aisle so you\u2019re out the door before you realize what a piece of crap you just bought.</p><p>But then another thought hits me: What if this is all some sort of master plan? Find the most na\u00efve American you can and lure her onto a train, then ditch her and send in the . . . I don\u2019t know . . . the thugs to nab her? Mom DVR\u2019d a segment about something just like this on 20/20. What if that\u2019s why he was looking at me last night, that\u2019s why he sought me out earlier today on the train from Stratford-upon-Avon? Could he have chosen easier prey? I\u2019ve seen enough of those Animal Planet nature shows to know that the lions always go for the weakest gazelles.</p><p>And yet, as unrealistic as this possibility is, on a certain level, there\u2019s a nugget of cold comfort in it. The world makes sense again. That at least would explain why I am on this train.</p><p>Something lands on my head, soft and crackly, but in my panic, it makes me jump.</p> <p>And there\u2019s another one. I pick up the projectile, a packet of Walker\u2019s salt-and-vinegar crisps.</p><p>I look up. Willem has the guilty grin of a bank robber, not to mention loot spilling out of his hands: a candy bar, three cups of assorted hot beverages, a bottle of orange juice under one armpit, a can of Coke under the other. \u201cSorry about the wait. The caf\u00e9 is at the other end of the train, and they wouldn\u2019t open it until the train left St. Pancras, and there was already a queue. Then I wasn\u2019t sure if you liked coffee or tea, so I got you both. But then I remembered your Coke from earlier, so I went back for that. And then on the way back, I stumbled onto a very cranky Belgian and spilled coffee all over myself, so I had to detour to the loo, but I think I just made things worse.\u201d He plunks down two of the small cardboard cups and the can of soda on the tray table in front of me. He gestures to the front of his jeans, which now have a huge wet splodge down the front of them.</p><p>I am not the sort of person to laugh at fart jokes or gross-out humor. When Jonathan Spalicki let one rip in physiology last year and Mrs. Huberman had to let the hysterical class out early, she actually thanked me for being the only one to exhibit any self-control.</p><p>So it\u2019s not like me to lose it. Over a wet spot.</p><p>And yet, when I open my mouth to inform Willem that I actually don\u2019t like soda, that the Coke before was for Melanie\u2019s hangover, what comes out is a yelp. And once I hear my own laughter, it sets off fireworks. I\u2019m laughing so hard, I am gasping for air. The panicked tears that were threatening to spill out of my eyes now have a safe excuse to stream down my face.</p><p>Willem rolls his eyes and gives his jeans a yeah-yeah look. He grabs some of the napkins from the tray. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was so bad.\u201d He dabs at his jeans. \u201cDoes coffee leave a stain?\u201d</p> <p>This sends me into further paroxysms of laughter. Willem offers a wry, patient smile. He is big enough to accept the joke at his expense.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m. Sorry.\u201d I gasp. \u201cNot. Laughing. At. Your. Pants.\u201d</p><p>Pants! In her tutorial of British English versus American English, Ms. Foley had informed us that the English call underwear pants and pants trousers, and we should be mindful of announcing anything to do with pants to avoid any embarrassing misunderstandings. She went pink as she explained it.</p><p>I am doubled over now. When I manage to sit upright, I see one of the French girls coming back down the aisle. As she edges behind Willem, she rests a hand on his arm; it lingers there for a second. Then she says something in French, before slipping into her seat.</p><p>Willem doesn\u2019t even look at her. Instead, he turns back to me. His dark eyes dangle question marks.</p><p>\u201cI thought you got off the train.\u201d The admission just slips out on the champagne bubbles of my relief.</p><p>Oh, my God. Did I actually say that? The giggles shock right out of me. I\u2019m afraid to look at him. Because if he didn\u2019t want to leave me on the train before, I\u2019ve remedied that now.</p><p>I feel the give of the seat as Willem sits down, and when I gather up the courage to peer over at him, I\u2019m surprised to find that he doesn\u2019t look shocked or disgusted. He just has that amused private smile on his face.</p> <p>He begins to unpack the junk food and pulls a bent baguette out of his backpack. After he\u2019s laid everything out over the trays, he looks right at me. \u201cAnd why would I get off the train?\u201d he asks at last, his voice light and teasing.</p><p>I could make up a lie. Because he forgot something. Or because he realized he needed to get back to Holland after all, and there wasn\u2019t time to tell me. Something ridiculous but less incriminating. But I don\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cBecause you changed your mind.\u201d I await his disgust, his shock, his pity, but he still looks amused, maybe a little intrigued now too. And I feel this unexpected rush, like I just took a hit of some drug, my own personal truth serum. So I tell him the rest. \u201cBut then for a brief minute, I thought maybe this was all some sort of scam and you were going to sell me into sex slavery or something.\u201d</p><p>I look at him, wondering if I\u2019ve pushed too far. But he is smiling as he strokes his chin. \u201cHow would I do that?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. You\u2019d have to make me pass out or something. What\u2019s that stuff they use? Chloroform? They put it on a handkerchief and put up against your nose, and you fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s just in movies. Probably easier for me to drug your drink like your friend suspected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you got me three drinks, one of them unopened.\u201d I hold up the can of Coke. \u201cI don\u2019t drink Coke, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy plan is foiled then.\u201d He exaggerates a sigh. \u201cToo bad. I could get good money for you on the black market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much do you think I\u2019m worth?\u201d I ask, amazed at how quickly fear has become fodder.</p><p>He looks me up and looks me down, appraising me. \u201cWell, it would depend on various factors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAge. How old are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cMeasurements?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive feet four. One hundred and fifteen pounds. I don\u2019t know metric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny unusual body parts or scars or false limbs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFetishists. They pay extra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no prosthetic limbs or anything.\u201d But then I remember my birthmark, which is ugly, almost like a scar, so I usually keep it hidden under my watch. But there\u2019s something oddly tempting about exposing it, exposing me. So I slide my watch down. \u201cI do have this.\u201d</p><p>He takes it in, nodding his head. Then casually asks, \u201cAnd are you a virgin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that make me more or less valuable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt all depends on the market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem to know a lot about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grew up in Amsterdam,\u201d he says, like this explains it.</p><p>\u201cSo what am I worth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer all the questions.\u201d\u2018</p><p>I have the strangest sensation then, like I\u2019m holding the belt to a bathrobe and I can tie it tighter\u2014or let it drop. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. A virgin.\u201d</p><p>He nods, stares in a way that unsettles me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Boris will be disappointed,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Boris?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thuggish Ukrainian who\u2019s going to do the dirty work. You were just the bait.\u201d</p><p>Now he laughs, tilting his long neck back. When he comes up for air, he says, \u201cI usually work with Bulgarians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tease all you want, but there was a thing on TV about it. And it\u2019s not like I know you.\u201d</p><p>He pauses, looks straight at me, then says: \u201cTwenty. One point nine meters. Seventy-five kilos, last time I checked. This,\u201d he points to a zigzag scar on his foot. Then he looks me dead in the eye. \u201cAnd no.\u201d</p><p>It takes me a minute to realize that he\u2019s answering the same four questions he asked me. When I do, I feel a flush start to creep up my neck.</p><p>\u201cAlso, we had breakfast together. Usually the people I have breakfast with, I know very well.\u201d</p><p>Now the flush tidal-waves into a full-on blush. I try to think of something quippy to say back. But it\u2019s hard to be witty when someone is looking at you like that.</p><p>\u201cDid you really believe I would leave you on the train?\u201d he asks.</p><p>The question is oddly jarring after all that hilarity about black-market sex slavery. I think about it. Did I really think he\u2019d do that?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer. \u201cMaybe I was just having a minor panic because doing something impulsive like this, it\u2019s not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou\u2019re here, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I repeat. And I am. Here. On my way to Paris. With him. I look at him. He\u2019s got that half smile, as if there\u2019s something about me that\u2019s endlessly amusing. And maybe it\u2019s that, or the rocking of the train, or the fact that I\u2019ll never see him again after the one day, or maybe once you open the trapdoor of honesty, there\u2019s no going back. Or maybe it\u2019s just because I want to. But I let the robe drop to the floor. \u201cI thought you got off the train because I was having a hard time believing you\u2019d be on the train in the first place. With me. Without some ulterior motive.\u201d</p><p>And this is the truth. Because I may be only eighteen, but it already seems pretty obvious that the world is divided into two groups: the doers and the watchers. The people things happen to and the rest of us, who just sort of plod on with things. The Lulus and the Allysons.</p><p>It never occurred to me that by pretending to be Lulu, I might slip into that other column, even for just a day.</p><p>I turn to Willem, to see what he\u2019ll say to this, but before he responds, the train plunges into darkness as we enter the Channel Tunnel. According to the factoids I read, in less than twenty minutes, we will be in Calais and then, an hour later, Paris. But right now, I have a feeling that this train is not just delivering me to Paris, but to someplace entirely new.</p><p>Four</p><p>Paris</p><p>Immediately, there are problems. The luggage storage place in the basement of the train station is shuttered; the workers who run the X-ray machines the bags have to pass through before they go into storage are on strike. As a result, all the automated lockers large enough for my bag are full. Willem says there\u2019s another station that\u2019s not so far from here we might try, but if the baggage handlers are on strike, we might have the same problem there too.</p><p>\u201cI can just drag it behind me. Or toss it into the Seine.\u201d I\u2019m joking, though there is something appealing about abandoning all vestiges of Allyson.</p><p>\u201cI have a friend who works in a nightclub not so far from here. . . .\u201d He reaches into his backpack and pulls out a battered leather notebook. I\u2019m about to make a joke about it being his little black book, but then I see all the names and numbers and email addresses scrawled in there, and he adds, \u201cShe does the books, so she\u2019s usually there in the afternoons,\u201d and I realize that it actually is a little black book.</p><p>After finding the number he\u2019s after, he pulls out an ancient cell phone, presses the power key a few times. \u201cNo battery. Does yours work?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head. \u201cIt\u2019s useless in Europe. Except as a camera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can walk. It\u2019s close to here.\u201d</p><p>We head back up the escalators. Before we get to the automatic doors, Willem turns to me and asks, \u201cAre you ready for Paris?\u201d</p><p>In all the stress of dealing with my luggage, I\u2019d sort of forgotten that the point of all this was Paris. Suddenly, I\u2019m a little nervous. \u201cI hope so,\u201d I say weakly.</p> <p>We walk out the front of the train station and step into the shimmering heat. I squint, as if preparing for blinding disappointment. Because the truth of it is, so far on this tour, I\u2019ve been let down by pretty much everywhere we went. Maybe I watch too many movies. In Rome, I really wanted an Audrey Hepburn Roman Holiday experience, but the Trevi Fountain was crowded, there was a McDonald\u2019s at the base of the Spanish Steps, and the ruins smelled like cat pee because of all the strays. The same thing happened in Prague, where I\u2019d been yearning for some of the bohemianism of The Unbearable Lightness of Being. But no, there were no fabulous artists, no guys who looked remotely like a young Daniel Day-Lewis. I saw one mysterious-looking guy reading Sartre in a caf\u00e9, but then his cell phone rang and he started talking in a loud Texas twang.</p><p>And London. Melanie and I got ourselves completely lost on the Tube just so we could visit Notting Hill, but all we found was a fancy, expensive area full of upscale shops. No quaint bookstores, no groups of lovable friends I\u2019d want to have dinner parties with. It seemed like there was a direct link between number of movies I\u2019d seen about a city and the degree of my disappointment. And I\u2019ve seen a lot of movies about Paris.</p><p>The Paris that greets me outside Gare du Nord is not the Paris of the movies. There\u2019s no Eiffel Tower or fancy couture stores here. It\u2019s just a regular street, with a bunch of hotels and exchange bureaus, clogged with taxis and buses.</p><p>I look around. There are rows and rows of old grayish-brown buildings. They are uniform, seeming to ripple into one another, their windows and French doors thrown open, flowers spilling out. Right across from the station are two caf\u00e9s, catty-corner. Neither one is fancy, but both are packed\u2014people clustered at round glass tables, under the awnings and umbrellas. It\u2019s both so normal and so completely foreign.</p><p>Willem and I start walking. We cross the street and pass one of caf\u00e9s. There\u2019s a woman sitting alone at one of the tables, drinking pink wine and smoking a cigarette, a small bulldog panting by her legs. As we walk by, the dog jumps up and starts sniffing under my skirt, tangling me and him in his leash.</p> <p>The woman must be around my mom\u2019s age, but is wearing a short skirt and high-heeled espadrilles that lace up her shapely legs. She scolds the dog and untangles the leash. I bend over to scratch behind its ears, and the woman says something in French that makes Willem laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d I ask as we walk away.</p><p>\u201cShe said her dog is like a truffle hog when it comes to beautiful girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I feel flush with pleasure. Which is a little silly, because it was a dog, and also I\u2019m not entirely sure what a truffle hog is.</p><p>Willem and I walk down a block full of sex shops and travel agencies and turn a corner onto some unpronounceable boulevard, and for the first time, I understand that boulevard is actually a French word, that all the big streets called boulevards at home are actually just busy roads. Because here is a boulevard: a river of life, grand, broad, and flowing, a plaza running down the middle and graceful trees arcing out toward one another overhead.</p><p>At a redlight, a cute guy in a skinny suit riding a moped in the bike lane stops to check me out, looking me up and down until the moped behind him beeps its horn for him to move on.</p> <p>Okay, this is, like, twice in five minutes. Granted, the first one was a dog, but it feels significant. For the past three weeks, it\u2019s been Melanie getting the catcalls\u2014a result of her blond hair and LOOK AT ME wardrobe, I cattily assumed. Once or twice, I huffed about the objectification of women, but Melanie rolled her eyes and said I was missing the point.</p><p>As this lightness buoys me, I wonder if maybe she was right. Maybe it\u2019s not about looking hot for guys, but about feeling like a place acknowledged you, winked at you, accepted you. It\u2019s strange because, of all the people in all the cities, I\u2019d have thought that to Parisians I\u2019d be invisible, but apparently I\u2019m not. Apparently, in Paris, not only can I skate, but I practically qualify for the Olympics!</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s official,\u201d I declare. \u201cI love Paris!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you know, you know. It\u2019s just become my favorite city in the whole world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt tends to have that effect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should add that there wasn\u2019t much competition, seeing as I didn\u2019t actually enjoy most of the places on the tour.\u201d</p><p>And again, it just slips out. Apparently when you only have one day, you can say anything and live to tell. The trip has been a bust. How good it feels to finally admit this to someone. Because I couldn\u2019t tell my parents, who had paid for what they believed was the Trip of a Lifetime. And I couldn\u2019t tell Melanie, who really was on the Trip of a Lifetime. And not Ms. Foley, whose job it was to ensure I had the Trip of a Lifetime. But it\u2019s true. I\u2019ve spent the last three weeks trying to have fun\u2014and failing.</p> <p>\u201cI think maybe traveling is a talent, like whistling or dancing,\u201d I continue. \u201cAnd some people have it\u2014you seem to. I mean, how long have you been traveling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo years,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cTwo years with breaks?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cTwo years since I\u2019ve been back to Holland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? And you were supposed to go back today? After two years?\u201d</p><p>He throws his arms up into the air. \u201cWhat\u2019s one more day after two years?\u201d</p><p>I suppose to him, not a lot. But to me, maybe something else. \u201cThat just proves my point. You have the talent for traveling. I\u2019m not sure that I do. I keep hearing everyone go on about how travel broadens your horizons. I\u2019m not even sure what that means, but it hasn\u2019t broadened anything for me, because I\u2019m no good at it.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s mostly silent as we walk over a long bridge spanning dozens of railroad tracks, graffiti everywhere. Then he says, \u201cTraveling\u2019s not something you\u2019re good at. It\u2019s something you do. Like breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I breathe just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Have you ever thought about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably more than most people. My father\u2019s a pulmonologist. A lung doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I mean is, have you ever thought about how it is that you do it? Day and night? While you sleep. While you eat. While you talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think about breathing?\u201d But then all of sudden I do. I get tangled up in thoughts about breathing, the mechanics of it, how is it that my body knows to do it even when I\u2019m sleeping, or crying, or hiccupping. What would happen if my body somehow forgot? And sure enough, my breath grows a little labored, as if I\u2019m walking uphill, even though I\u2019m walking down the slope of the bridge.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that was weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Willem asks. \u201cYou thought too hard. Same with travel. You can\u2019t work too much at it, or it feels like work. You have to surrender yourself to the chaos. To the accidents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to walk in front of a bus and then I\u2019ll have a good time?\u201d</p><p>Willem chuckles. \u201cNot those accidents. The little things that happen. Sometimes they\u2019re insignificant; other times, they change everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis all sounds very Jedi. Can you be more specific?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guy picks up a girl hitchhiking in a faraway country. A year later, she runs out of money and winds up on his doorstep. Six months after that, they get married. Accidents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you marry a hitchhiker or something?\u201d</p><p>His smile unfurls like a sail. \u201cI\u2019m giving examples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me a real one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that\u2019s not real?\u201d he teases. \u201cOkay, this happened to me. Last year when I was in Berlin, I missed my train to Bucharest and caught a ride to Slovakia instead. The people I rode with were in a theater troupe, and one of the guys had just broken his ankle and they needed a replacement. On the six-hour ride to Bratislava, I learned his part. I stayed with the troupe until his ankle got better, and then a while after that, I met some people from Guerrilla Will, and they were in desperate need of someone who could do Shakespeare in French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you could?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cAre you some kind of language savant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just Dutch. So I joined Guerrilla Will.\u201d He snaps his fingers. \u201cNow I\u2019m an actor.\u201d</p><p>This surprises me. \u201cYou seemed like you\u2019d been doing it a lot longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just accidental, just temporary. Until the next accident sends me somewhere new. That\u2019s how life works.\u201d</p><p>Something quickens in my chest. \u201cDo you really think that\u2019s how it works? That life can change justlikethat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think everything is happening all the time, but if you don\u2019t put yourself in the path of it, you miss it. When you travel, you put yourself out there. It\u2019s not always great. Sometimes it\u2019s terrible. But other times . . .\u201d He lifts his shoulders and gestures out to Paris, then sneaks me a sidelong glance. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo long as you don\u2019t get hit by a bus,\u201d I say.</p><p>He laughs. Then gives me the point. \u201cSo long as you don\u2019t get hit by a bus,\u201d he says back.</p><p>Five</p><p>We arrive at the club where Willem\u2019s friend works; it seems completely dead, but when Willem pounds on the door, a tall man with blue-black skin opens up. Willem speaks to him in French, and after a minute, we\u2019re allowed into a huge dank room with a small stage, a narrow bar, and a bunch of tables with chairs stacked on them. Willem and the Giant confer a bit more in French and then Willem turns to me.</p><p>\u201cC\u00e9line doesn\u2019t like surprises. Maybe it\u2019s better if I go down first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d In the hushed dim, my voice seems to clang, and I realize I\u2019m nervous again.</p><p>Willem heads to a staircase at the back of the club. The Giant resumes his work polishing bottles behind the bar. Obviously, he didn\u2019t get the message that Paris loves me. I take a seat on the barstool. They twirl all the way around, like the barstools at Whipple\u2019s, the ice-cream place I used to go to with my grandparents. The Giant is ignoring me, so I just sort of spin myself this way and that. And then I guess I do it a little fast, because I go spinning and the barstool comes clear off its base.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit! Ow!\u201d</p><p>The Giant comes out to where I am sprawled on the floor. His face is a picture of blas\u00e9. He picks up the stool and screws it back in, then goes back behind the bar. I stay on the floor for a second, wondering which is more humiliating, remaining down here or getting back on the stool.</p><p>\u201cYou are American?\u201d</p><p>What gives it away? Because I\u2019m clumsy? Aren\u2019t French people ever clumsy? I\u2019m actually pretty graceful. I took ballet for eight years. I should tell him to fix the stool before someone sues. No, if I say that, I\u2019ll definitely sound American.</p><p>\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d I don\u2019t know why I bother to ask. Since the moment our plane touched down in London, it\u2019s like there\u2019s been a neon sign above my head, blinking: TOURIST, AMERICAN, OUTSIDER. I should be used to it. Except since arriving in Paris, it felt like it had maybe dimmed. Clearly not.</p><p>\u201cYour friend tells me,\u201d he says. \u201cMy brother lives in Roch\u00e9 Estair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Am I supposed to know where this is? \u201cIs that near Paris?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughs, a big loud belly laugh. \u201cNo. It is in New York. Near the big lake.\u201d</p><p>Roch\u00e9 Estair? \u201cOh! Rochester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Roch\u00e9 Estair,\u201d he repeats. \u201cIt is very cold up there. Very much snow. My brother\u2019s name is Aliou Mjodi. Maybe you know him?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI live in Pennsylvania, next to New York.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs there much snow in Penisvania?\u201d</p><p>I suppress a laugh. \u201cThere\u2019s a fair amount in Penn-syl-vania,\u201d I say, emphasizing the pronunciation. \u201cBut not as much as Rochester.\u201d</p><p>He shivers. \u201cToo cold. Especially for us. We have Senegalese blood in our veins, though we both are born in Paris. But now my brother he goes to study computers in Roch\u00e9 Estair, at university.\u201d The Giant looks very proud. \u201cHe does not like the snow. And he says, in summer, the mosquitoes are as big as those in Senegal.\u201d</p><p>I laugh.</p><p>The Giant\u2019s face breaks open into a jack-o\u2019-lantern\u2019s smile. \u201cHow long in Paris?\u201d</p> <p>I look at my watch. \u201cI\u2019ve been here one hour, and I\u2019ll be here for one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day? Why are you here?\u201d He gestures to the bar.</p><p>I point to my bag. \u201cWe need a place to store this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it downstairs. You must not waste your one day here. When the sun shines, you let it shine on you. Snow is always waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWillem told me to wait, that C\u00e9line\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPff,\u201d he interrupts, waving his hand. He comes out from behind the bar and easily hoists my bag over his shoulder. \u201cCome, I take it downstairs for you.\u201d</p> <p>At the bottom of the stairs is a dark hallway crowded with speakers, amplifiers, cables, and lights. Upstairs, there\u2019s rapping on the door, and the Giant bounds back up, telling me to leave the bag in the office.</p><p>There are a couple of doors, so I go to the first one and knock on it. It opens to a small room with a metal desk, an old computer, a pile of papers. Willem\u2019s backpack is there, but he\u2019s not. I go back in the hall and hear the sound of a woman\u2019s rapid-fire French, and then Willem\u2019s voice, languid in response.</p><p>\u201cWillem?\u201d I call out. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>He says something back, but I don\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He says something else, but I can\u2019t hear him so I crack open the door to find a small supply closet full of boxes and in it, Willem standing right up close to a girl\u2014C\u00e9line\u2014who even in the half darkness, I can see is beautiful in a way I can never even pretend to be. She is talking to Willem in a throaty voice while tugging his shirt over his head. He, of course, is laughing.</p><p>I slam the door shut and retreat back toward the stairs, tipping over my suitcase in my haste.</p><p>I hear something rattle. \u201cLulu, open the door. It\u2019s stuck.\u201d</p> <p>I turn around. My suitcase is lodged underneath the handle. I scurry back to kick it out of the way and turn back toward the stairs as the door flies open.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Willem asks.</p><p>\u201cLeaving.\u201d It\u2019s not like Willem and I are anything to each other, but still, he left me upstairs to come downstairs for a quickie?</p><p>\u201cCome back.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ve heard about the French. I\u2019ve seen plenty of French films. A lot of them are sexy; some of them are kinky. I want to be Lulu, but not that much.</p><p>\u201cLulu!\u201d Willem\u2019s voice is firm. \u201cC\u00e9line refuses to hold your bags unless I change my clothes,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe says I look like a dirty old man coming out of a sex shop.\u201d He points to his crotch.</p><p>It takes me a minute to understand what she means, and when I do, I flush.</p><p>C\u00e9line says something to Willem in French, and he laughs. And fine, maybe it\u2019s not what I thought it was. But it\u2019s still pretty clear that I\u2019ve intruded upon something.</p><p>Willem turns back to me. \u201cI said I will change my jeans, but all my other shirts are just as dirty, so she is finding me one.\u201d</p><p>C\u00e9line continues yapping away at Willem in French, and it\u2019s like I don\u2019t even exist.</p><p>Finally, she finds what she\u2019s looking for, a heather-gray T-shirt with a giant red SOS emblazoned on it. Willem takes it and yanks off his own T-shirt. C\u00e9line says something else and reaches out to undo his belt buckle. He holds his hands up in surrender and then undoes the buttons himself. The jeans fall to the floor and Willem just stands there, all miles and miles of him, in nothing but a pair of fitted boxer shorts.</p><p>\u201cExcusez-moi,\u201d he says as he brushes past me so close his bare torso slides up against my arm. It\u2019s dark in here, but I\u2019m fairly certain C\u00e9line can tell I\u2019m blushing and has marked this as a point against me. A few seconds later, Willem returns with his backpack. He digs in it for a rumpled-but-stain-free pair of jeans. I try not to stare as he slips them on and threads his worn brown leather belt through the loops. Then he puts on the T-shirt. C\u00e9line glances at me looking at him, and I look away as though she\u2019s caught me at something. Which she has. Watching him get dressed feels more illicit than seeing him strip.</p><p>\u201cD\u2019accord?\u201d he asks C\u00e9line. She appraises him, her hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cMieux,\u201d she says back, sounding like a cat. Mew.</p><p>\u201cLulu?\u201d Willem asks.</p><p>\u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>Finally, C\u00e9line acknowledges me. She says something, gesticulating wildly, then stops.</p><p>When I fail to answer, one of C\u00e9line\u2019s eyebrows shoots up into a perfect arch, while the other one stays in neutral. I\u2019ve seen women from Florence to Prague do this same thing. It must be some skill they teach in European schools.</p><p>\u201cShe is asking you if you have ever heard of Sous ou Sur,\u201d Willem says, pointing to the SOS on the shirt. \u201cThey are a famous punk-rap band with strong lyrics about justice.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, feeling like a double loser for not having heard of the cool French anarchist whatever justice band. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t speak French.\u201d</p><p>C\u00e9line looks disdainful. Another stupid American who can\u2019t be bothered to learn any other languages.</p><p>\u201cI speak a little Mandarin,\u201d I offer hopefully, but this fails to impress.</p><p>C\u00e9line deigns to switch to English: \u201cBut your name. Lulu, it is French, non?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a small pause. Like at a concert in between songs. A perfect time to say, ever so casually, \u201cActually, my name is Allyson.\u201d</p><p>But then Willem answers for me. \u201cIt\u2019s short for Louise.\u201d And he winks at me.</p><p>C\u00e9line points at my suitcase with a manicured purple fingernail. \u201cThat is the bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. This is it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is so big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that big.\u201d I think about some of the bags other girls brought on the tour, the hair dryers and adapters and three changes of clothes per day. I look at her in her black mesh tunic that stops at her thighs, a tiny black skirt that Melanie would pay too much for, and suspect this knowledge would fail to impress her.</p><p>\u201cIt can live in the storage room, not in my office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Just so long as I can get it tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cleaner will be here at ten o\u2019clock. And here, we have so many extra, you can have one too,\u201d she says, handing me the same T-shirt she gave Willem, only mine is at least a size larger than his.</p><p>I\u2019m about to open my suitcase and stuff it in, but then I visualize the contents: the sensible A-line skirts and T-shirts that Mom picked out for me. My travel journal, the entries I hoped would be breathless accounts of adventure but wound up reading like a series of telegrams: Today we went to the Prague Castle. Stop. Then we saw The Magic Flute at the State Opera House. Stop. Had chicken cutlets for dinner. Stop. The postcards from Famous European Cities, blank because after I\u2019d mailed the obligatory few to my parents and grandmother, I\u2019d had no one left to send them to. And then there\u2019s the Ziploc bag with one lone piece of paper inside. Before the trip, my mom made me a master inventory of all the things to bring and then she made copies, one for every stop, so each time I packed, I could check off each item, to ensure I didn\u2019t leave anything behind. There is one sheet left for my supposed last stop in London.</p><p>I stuff the T-shirt into my shoulder bag. \u201cI\u2019ll just hang on to this. To sleep in tonight.\u201d</p><p>C\u00e9line\u2019s eyebrow shoots up again. She probably never sleeps in a T-shirt. She probably sleeps in the silky nude, even on the coldest of winter nights. I get a flash of her sleeping naked next to Willem.</p><p>\u201cThanks. For the shirt. For storing my bag,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cMerci,\u201d C\u00e9line says back, and I wonder why it is that she\u2019s thanking me, but then I realize she wants me to say thank you in French, so I do, only it comes out sounding like mercy.</p><p>We go upstairs. C\u00e9line is nattering away to Willem. I\u2019m beginning to understand how his French got so fluent. As if this didn\u2019t make it clear enough that she was a dog and Willem her hydrant, when we get upstairs, she links arms with him and walks him slowly to the front of the bar. I feel like waving my arms and saying \u201cHello! Remember me?\u201d</p><p>When they do that cheek-cheek-kiss-kiss thing, I feel so much of the excitement from earlier dwindle. Next to C\u00e9line, with her mile-high stilettos, her black hair, the underneath dyed blond, her perfectly symmetrical face, which is both marred and enhanced by so many piercings, I feel short as a midget and plain as a mop. And once again, I wonder, Why did he bring me here? Then I think of Shane Michaels.</p><p>All through tenth grade, I\u2019d had a huge crush on Shane, a senior. We\u2019d hang out, and he\u2019d flirt with me and invite me lots of places and pay for me even, and he\u2019d confide all kinds of personal things, including, yes, about the girls he was dating. But those relationships never lasted more than a few weeks, and I\u2019d told myself that all the while, he and I were growing closer and that he\u2019d eventually fall for me. When months went by and nothing happened between us, Melanie said it was never going to happen. \u201cYou have Sidekick Syndrome,\u201d she said. At the time, I thought she was jealous, but of course, she was right. It hits me that, Evan notwithstanding, it might be a lifetime affliction.</p><p>I can feel myself shriveling, feel the welcome Paris bestowed on me earlier fading away, if it even really happened. How stupid to think a dog sniffing my crotch and a quick look from some random guy meant anything. Paris adores girls like C\u00e9line. Genuine Lulus, not counterfeits.</p><p>But then, just as we\u2019re at the door, the Giant comes out from behind the bar and takes my hand and, with a jaunty \u201c\u00e0 bient\u00f4t,\u201d kisses both my cheeks.</p><p>A warm feeling tickles my chest. This is the first time on the trip a local has been unabashedly nice to me\u2014because he wanted to, not because I was paying him to. And it doesn\u2019t escape my notice that Willem is no longer looking at C\u00e9line but is watching me, a curious expression lighting up his face. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s these things or something else, but it makes that kiss, which I get was just platonic\u2014a friendly, cheek-handshake thing\u2014feel momentous. A kiss from all of Paris.</p><p>Six</p><p>Lulu, we have something very important to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Willem looks at me solemnly, and I feel my stomach bottom out in anxiety over another unpleasant surprise.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d I ask, trying not to sound nervous.</p><p>He crosses his arms in front of his chest and then he strokes his chin. Is he going to send me back? No! I\u2019ve already had that freak-out once today.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ask again, my voice rising in spite of my best efforts.</p><p>\u201cWe lost an hour coming to France, so it\u2019s after two o\u2019clock. Lunchtime. And this is Paris. And we just have the day. So we must consider this very seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I exhale relief. Is he trying to mess with me now? \u201cI don\u2019t care. Anything except chocolate and bread, please. Those might be your staples, but they don\u2019t seem particularly French,\u201d I snap, not entirely sure why I\u2019m so peeved except that even though we\u2019ve now walked several blocks away from C\u00e9line\u2019s club, it\u2019s like she\u2019s following us somehow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Willem feigns offense. \u201cBread and chocolate are not my staple foods.\u201d He grins. \u201cNot the only ones. And they are very French. Chocolate croissants? We can have those for breakfast tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Breakfast. Tomorrow. After tonight. C\u00e9line beings to feel a little farther away now.</p><p>\u201cUnless, that is, you prefer crisps for breakfast,\u201d he continues. \u201cOr pancakes. That\u2019s American. Maybe crisps with your pancakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t eat chips for breakfast. I do occasionally eat pancakes for dinner. I\u2019m a rebel that way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCr\u00eapes,\u201d he says, snapping his fingers. \u201cWe will have cr\u00eapes. Very French. And you can be rebellious.\u201d</p><p>We walk along, menu-browsing the caf\u00e9s until we find one on a quiet triangle corner that serves cr\u00eapes. The menu is hand-scrawled, in French, but I don\u2019t ask Willem to translate. After that whole thing with C\u00e9line, my lack of fluency is starting to feel like a handicap. So I stumble through the menu, settling on citron, which I\u2019m pretty sure means lemon, or orange, or citrus of some kind. I decide on a citron cr\u00eape and a citron press\u00e9 drink, hoping it\u2019s some kind of lemonade.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He scratches his chin. There is a tiny patch of golden stubble there. \u201cI was thinking of getting a chocolate cr\u00eape, but that is so close to chocolate and bread that I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll lose respect for me.\u201d He flashes me that lazy half smile.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t sweat it. I already lost respect for you when I found you undressing for C\u00e9line in her office,\u201d I joke.</p> <p>And there\u2019s that look: surprise, amusement. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t her office,\u201d he says slowly, drawing out his words. \u201cAnd I would say she was more undressing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, never mind, then. By all means, order the chocolate.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a long look. \u201cNo. To repent, I will order mine with Nutella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s hardly repenting. Nutella is practically chocolate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s made from nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd chocolate! It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou just say that because you\u2019re American.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat has nothing to do with it! You seem to have a bottomless appetite for chocolate and bread, but I don\u2019t assume it\u2019s because you\u2019re Dutch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would it be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDutch Cocoa? You guys have the lock on it.\u201d</p><p>Willem laughs. \u201cI think you have us confused with the Belgians. And I get my sweet tooth from my mother, who\u2019s not even Dutch. She says she craved chocolate all through her pregnancy with me and that\u2019s why I like it so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures. Blame the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s blaming?\u201d</p><p>The waitress comes over with our drinks.</p> <p>\u201cSo, C\u00e9line,\u201d I begin, knowing I should let this go but am somehow unable to. \u201cShe\u2019s, like, the bookkeeper? At the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I know it\u2019s catty, but I\u2019m gratified that it\u2019s such a dull job. Until Willem elaborates. \u201cNot the bookkeeper. She books all the bands, so she knows all these musicians.\u201d And if that\u2019s not bad enough, he adds, \u201cShe does some of the artwork for the posters too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I deflate. \u201cShe must be very talented. Do you know her from the acting thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, how did you meet?\u201d</p><p>He plays with the wrapper from my straw.</p><p>\u201cI get it,\u201d I say, wondering why I\u2019m bothering to ask what is so painfully clear. \u201cYou guys were an item.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Surprise. And relief.</p><p>And then Willem says, ever so casually, \u201cWe just fell in love once.\u201d</p><p>I take a gulp of my citron press\u00e9\u2014and choke on it. It turns out it\u2019s not lemonade so much as lemon juice and water. Willem hands me a cube of sugar and a napkin.</p><p>\u201cOnce?\u201d I say when I recover.</p><p>\u201cIt was a while ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are good friends. As you saw.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s exactly what I saw.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not in love with her anymore?\u201d I run my fingers along the rim of my glass.</p><p>Willem looks at me. \u201cI never said I was in love with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said you fell in love with her once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I did.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, confused.</p><p>\u201cThere is a world of difference, Lulu, between falling in love and being in love.\u201d</p><p>I feel my face go hot, and I\u2019m not entirely sure why. \u201cIsn\u2019t it just sequential\u2014A follows B?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to fall in love to be in love, but falling in love isn\u2019t the same as being in love.\u201d Willem peers at me from under his lashes. \u201cHave you ever fallen in love?\u201d</p><p>Evan and I broke up the day after he mailed in his college tuition deposit. It wasn\u2019t unexpected. Not really. We had already agreed we would break up when we went to college if we didn\u2019t wind up in the same geographical area. And he was going to school in St. Louis. I was going to school in Boston. The thing I hadn\u2019t expected was the timing. Evan decided it made more sense to \u201crip the bandage off\u201d and break up not in June, when we graduated, or in August, when we\u2019d leave for school, but in April.</p><p>But the thing is, aside from being sort of humiliated by the rumor that I\u2019d been dumped and disappointed about missing prom, I wasn\u2019t actually sad about losing Evan. I was surprisingly neutral about breaking up with my first boyfriend. It was like he\u2019d never even been there. I didn\u2019t miss him, and Melanie quickly filled up whatever gaps he\u2019d left in the schedule.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I reply. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in love.\u201d</p><p>Just then the waitress arrives with our cr\u00eapes. Mine is golden brown, wafting with the sweet tartness of lemon and sugar. I concentrate on that, cutting off a slice and popping it in my mouth. It melts on the tip of my tongue like a warm, sweet snowdrop.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked,\u201d Willem says. \u201cI asked if you\u2019ve ever fallen in love.\u201d</p><p>The playfulness is his voice is like an itch I just can\u2019t scratch. I look at him, wondering if he always parses semantics like this.</p><p>Willem puts down his fork and knife. \u201cThis is falling in love.\u201d With his finger, he swipes a bit of the Nutella from inside his cr\u00eape and puts a dollop on the inside of my wrist. It is hot and oozy and starts to melt against my sticky skin, but before it has a chance to slither away, Willem licks his thumb and wipes the smear of Nutella off and pops it into his mouth. It all happens fast, like a lizard zapping a fly. \u201cThis is being in love.\u201d And here he takes my other wrist, the one with my watch on it, and moves the watchband around until he sees what he\u2019s looking for. Once again, he licks his thumb. Only this time, he rubs it against my birthmark, hard, as if trying to scrub it off.</p><p>\u201cBeing in love is a birthmark?\u201d I joke as I retract my arm. But my voice has a tremble in it, and the place where his wet thumbprint is drying against my skin burns somehow.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something that never comes off, no matter how much you might want it to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re comparing love to a . . . stain?\u201d</p><p>He leans so far back in his seat that the front legs of his chair scrape off the floor. He looks very satisfied, with the cr\u00eape or with himself, I\u2019m not sure. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>I think of the coffee stain on his jeans. I think of Lady Macbeth and her \u201cOut, damned spot,\u201d stain, another speech I had to memorize for English. \u201cStain seems like an ugly word to describe love,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>Willem just shrugs. \u201cMaybe just in English. In Dutch, it\u2019s vlek. In French, it\u2019s tache.\u201d He shakes his head, laughs. \u201cNo, still ugly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many languages have you been stained in?\u201d</p><p>He licks his thumb again and reaches across the table for my wrist, where he missed the tiniest smudge of Nutella. This time he wipes it\u2014me\u2014clean. \u201cNone. It always comes off.\u201d He scoops the rest of the cr\u00eape into his mouth, taking the dull edge of his knife to scrape the Nutella off the plate. Then he runs his finger around the rim, smearing the last of it away.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd why get stained when getting dirty is so much more fun?\u201d I taste lemons in my mouth again, and I wonder where all the sweetness went.</p><p>Willem doesn\u2019t say anything. Just sips his coffee.</p><p>Three women wander into the caf\u00e9. They are all impossibly tall, almost as tall as Willem, and thin, with legs that seem to end at their boobs. They are like some strange race of human-giraffes. Models. I\u2019ve never seen one in the wild before, but it is obvious what they are. One of them is wearing a tiny pair of shorts and platform sandals; she checks Willem out, and he gives her his little half smile, but then it\u2019s like he catches himself and looks back at me.</p><p>\u201cYou know what it sounds like to me?\u201d I ask. \u201cIt sounds like you just like to screw around. Which is fine. But at least own that about yourself. Don\u2019t make up some bogus distinctions about falling in love versus being in love.\u201d</p><p>I hear my voice. I sound like Little Miss Muffet, all goody-two-shoes and sanctimonious. So not like Lulu. And I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m upset. What is it to me if he believes in falling in love versus being in love, or if he believes that love is something the tooth fairy shoves under your pillow?</p><p>When I look up, Willem\u2019s eyes are half lidded and smiling, like I\u2019m his court jester here to amuse him. It makes me feel covetous, a toddler about to tantrum for being refused something outrageous\u2014a pony\u2014she knows she can\u2019t have.</p><p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t even believe in love.\u201d My voice is petulant.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d His voice is quiet.</p><p>\u201cReally? Define love. What would \u2018being stained\u2019\u201d\u2014I make air quotes and roll my eyes\u2014\u201clook like?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t even pause to think about it. \u201cLike Yael and Bram.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that? Some Dutch Brangelina? That doesn\u2019t count, because who knows what it\u2019s really like for them?\u201d I watch the herd of models disappear inside the caf\u00e9, where they will no doubt feast on coffee and air. I imagine them one day fat and ordinary. Because nothing that beautiful lasts forever.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Brangelina?\u201d Willem asks absently. He reaches into his pocket for a coin and balances it between two knuckles, then flips it from knuckle to knuckle.</p><p>I watch the coin, watch his hands. They are big, but his fingers are delicate. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYael and Bram are my parents,\u201d he says quietly.</p><p>\u201cYour parents?\u201d</p><p>He completes a revolution with the coin and then tosses it into the air. \u201cStained. I like how you put it. Yael and Bram: Stained for twenty-five years.\u201d</p><p>He says it with both affection and sadness, and something in my stomach twists.</p><p>\u201cAre your parents like that?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re still married after nearly twenty-five years, but stained?\u201d I can\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they ever were. They were set up on a blind date in college. And they\u2019ve always seemed less like lovebirds than like amiable business partners, for whom I\u2019m the sole product.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSole. So you are alone?\u201d</p><p>Alone? I think he must mean only. And I\u2019m never alone, not with Mom and her color-coded calendar on the fridge, making sure every spare moment of my time is accounted for, making sure every aspect of my life is happily well managed. Except when I pause for a second and think about how I feel, at home, at the dinner table with Mom and Dad talking at me, not to me, at school with a bunch of people who never really became my friends, I understand that even if he didn\u2019t mean to, he got it right. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur parents quit while they were ahead,\u201d I say, repeating the line Mom and Dad always use when people ask if I\u2019m an only child. We quit while we were ahead.</p><p>\u201cI never understand some English sayings,\u201d Willem replies. \u201cIf you\u2019re ahead, why would you quit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a gambling term.\u201d</p><p>But Willem is shaking his head. \u201cI think it\u2019s human nature to keep going when you\u2019re ahead, no matter what. You quit while you\u2019re behind.\u201d Then he looks at me again, and as if realizing that he has maybe insulted me, he hastily adds, \u201cI\u2019m sure with you it was different.\u201d</p><p>When I was little, my parents had tried to have more children. First they went the natural route, then they went the fertility route, Mom going through a bunch of horrible procedures that never worked. Then they looked into adoption and were in the process of filling out all the paperwork when Mom got pregnant. She was so happy. I was in first grade at the time, and she\u2019d worked since I was a baby, but when the baby came, she was going to go on an extended leave from her job at a pharmaceutical company, then maybe only go back half time. But then in her fifth month, she lost the baby. That\u2019s when she and Dad decided to quit while they were ahead. That\u2019s what they told me. Except even back then, I think I\u2019d recognized it as a lie. They\u2019d wanted more, but they\u2019d had to settle with just me, and I had to be good enough so that we could all pretend that we weren\u2019t actually settling.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d I tell Willem now. \u201cMaybe nobody quits while they\u2019re really ahead. My parents always say that, but the truth is, they only stopped with me because they couldn\u2019t have any more. Not because I was enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you were enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWere you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cMaybe more than enough,\u201d he says cryptically. It almost sounds like he\u2019s bragging, except it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s bragging.</p><p>He starts doing the thing with the coin again. As we sit silently, I watch the coin, feeling something like suspense build in my stomach, wondering if he\u2019ll let it fall. But he doesn\u2019t. He just keeps spinning it. When he finishes, he flips it in the air and tosses it to me, just like he did last night.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d I say after a minute.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it part of the show?\u201d</p> <p>He cocks his head.</p><p>\u201cI mean, do you throw a coin to a girl at every performance, or was I special?\u201d</p><p>Last night after I got back to the hotel, I spent a long time examining the coin he\u2019d tossed me. It was a Czech koruna, worth about a nickel. But still, I\u2019d put it in a separate corner of my wallet, away from all the other foreign coins. I pull it out now. It glints in the bright afternoon sun.</p><p>Willem looks at it too. I\u2019m not sure if his answer is true or just maddeningly ambiguous, or maybe both. Because that\u2019s exactly what he says: \u201cMaybe both.\u201d</p><p>Seven</p><p>When we leave the restaurant, Willem asks me the time. I twist the watch around my wrist. It feels heavier than ever, the skin underneath itchy and pale from being stuck under the piece of chunky metal for the past three weeks. I haven\u2019t taken it off once.</p><p>It was a present, from my parents, though it was Mom who\u2019d given it to me on graduation night, after the party at the Italian restaurant with Melanie\u2019s family, where they told us about the tour.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I\u2019d asked. We were sitting at the kitchen table, decompressing from the day. \u201cYou already gave me a graduation present.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d smiled. \u201cI got you another.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d opened the box, seen the watch, fingered the heavy gold links. Read the engraving.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too much.\u201d And it was. In every way.</p><p>\u201cTime stops for no one,\u201d Mom had said, smiling a little sadly. \u201cYou deserve a good watch to keep up.\u201d Then she\u2019d snapped the watch on my wrist, shown me how she had an extra safety clasp installed, pointed out that it was waterproof too. \u201cIt\u2019ll never fall off. So you can take it to Europe with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. It\u2019s way too valuable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s insured. Besides, I threw away your Swatch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d I\u2019d worn my zebra-striped Swatch all through high school.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a grown-up now. You need a grown-up watch.\u201d</p><p>I look at my watch now. It\u2019s almost four. Back on the tour, I\u2019d be breathing a sigh of relief, because the busy part of the day would be winding down. Usually we had a rest around five, and most nights, by eight o\u2019clock, I could be back in my hotel room watching some movie.</p><p>\u201cWe should probably start seeing some of the sights,\u201d Willem says. \u201cDo you know what you want to do?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cWe could start with the Seine. Isn\u2019t that it?\u201d I point to a concrete embankment, underneath which is a river of sorts.</p><p>Willem laughs. \u201cNo, that\u2019s a canal.\u201d</p><p>We walk down the cobblestoned pathway, and Willem pulls out a thick Rough Guide to Europe. He opens to a small map of Paris, points out, more or less, where we are, an area called Villette.</p><p>\u201cThe Seine is here,\u201d he says, tracing a line down the map.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I look out at the boat, which is stuck now between two big metal gates; the area is filling up with water. Willem explains that this is a lock, basically an elevator that lifts and drops the boats down differing depths of the canals.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know so much about everything?\u201d</p><p>He laughs. \u201cI\u2019m Dutch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that means you\u2019re a genius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly about canals. They say \u2018God made the world, but the Dutch made Holland.\u2019\u201d And then he goes on to tell me about how so much of the country was reclaimed from the sea, about riding your bike along the low embankments that keep the water out of Holland. How it\u2019s an act of faith to ride your bike around, with the dikes above you, knowing somehow, even though you\u2019re below sea level, you\u2019re not under water. When he talks about it, he seems so young that I can almost see him as a towheaded little kid, eyes wide, staring out at the endless waterways and wondering where they all led to.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can go on one of those boats?\u201d I ask, pointing to the barge we just watched go through the lock.</p><p>Willem\u2019s eyes light up, and for a second, I see that boy again. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He looks inside the guidebook. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really cover this neighborhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we ask?\u201d</p><p>Willem asks someone in French and is given a very complicated answer full of hand gestures. He turns to me, clearly excited. \u201cYou\u2019re right. He says that they have boat rides leaving from the basin.\u201d</p><p>We go along the cobblestoned walkway until it lets out in a large lake, where people are paddling in canoes. Off to one side, next to a cement pier, a couple of boats are moored. But when we get over there, we find out that they\u2019re private boats. The tourist boats have left for the day.</p><p>\u201cWe can take a boat along the Seine,\u201d Willem says. \u201cIt\u2019s much more popular, and the boats run all day.\u201d His eyes are downcast. I can see he\u2019s disappointed, as if he let me down.</p><p>\u201cOh, no big deal. I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019s staring wistfully out at the water, and I see that he cares. And I know I don\u2019t know him, but I swear the boy is homesick. For boats and canals and watery things. And for a second, I think of what it must be like\u2014away from home for two years, and here he postponed his return for another day. He did that. For me.</p><p>There\u2019s a row of boats and barges tied up, bobbing in the breeze that\u2019s kicked up. I look at Willem; a melancholy expression is deepening the lines on his face. I look back at the boats.</p><p>\u201cActually, I do care,\u201d I say. I reach into my bag for my wallet, for the hundred-dollar bill folded inside. I hold it up in the air and call out, \u201cI\u2019m looking for a ride down the canals. And I can pay.\u201d</p><p>Willem\u2019s head jerks toward me. \u201cLulu, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>But I\u2019m walking away from him. \u201cAnyone willing to give us a lift down the canals?\u201d I call. \u201cI got good old-fashioned American greenbacks.\u201d</p><p>A pock-faced guy with sharp features and a scrubby goatee pops onto the side of a blue-canopied barge. \u201cHow many greenbacks?\u201d he asks in a very thick French accent.</p><p>\u201cAll of them!\u201d</p><p>He takes the C-note and stares at it up close. Then he smells it.</p><p>It must smell legit, because he says, \u201cIf my passengers agree, I will take you down the canal to Arsenal, close to Bastille. It is where we dock for the night.\u201d He gestures to the back of the boat where a quartet of gray-haired people are sitting around a small table, playing bridge or something. He calls out to one of them.</p><p>\u201cAye, Captain Jack,\u201d the man answers. He must be sixty. His hair is white, and his face is burnished red from the sun.</p><p>\u201cWe have some hitchhikers who want to come aboard with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan they play poker?\u201d one of the women asks.</p><p>I used to play seven-card stud for nickels with my grandfather before he died. He said I was an excellent bluffer.</p><p>\u201cDo not bother. She gave all her money to me,\u201d Captain Jack says.</p><p>\u201cHow much is he charging you?\u201d one of the men asks.</p><p>\u201cI offered him a hundred dollars,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cTo go where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown the canals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is why we call him Captain Jack,\u201d one of the men says. \u201cBecause he\u2019s a pirate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It is because my name is Jacques, and I am your captain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hundred dollars, Jacques?\u201d a woman with a long gray braid and startlingly blue eyes asks. \u201cThat seems a little much, even for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe offered this much.\u201d Jacques shrugs. \u201cAlso, now I will have more money to lose to you in poker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAhh, good point,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cAre you leaving now?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen is soon?\u201d It\u2019s after four. The day is speeding by.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot rush these things.\u201d He flicks his hand in the air. \u201cTime is like the water. Fluid.\u201d</p><p>Time doesn\u2019t seem fluid to me. It seems real and animate and hard as a rock.</p><p>\u201cWhat he means,\u201d says the guy with the ponytail, \u201cis that the trip to Arsenal takes a while and we were just about to open a bottle of claret. Come on, Captain Jack, let\u2019s shove off. For a hundred bucks, you can have your wine later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll continue with this fine French gin,\u201d the braided lady says.</p><p>He shrugs and then pockets my bill. I turn to Willem and grin. Then I nod at Captain Jack. He reaches out for my hand to escort me onboard.</p><p>The four passengers introduce themselves. They are Danish, retirees, and every year, they tell us, they rent a barge and cruise a European country for four weeks. Agnethe has the braid and Karin has short spiked hair. Bert has a shock of white hair and Gustav has the bald spot and the rat\u2019s tail of a ponytail and is sporting the ever-stylish socks-with-sandals look. Willem introduces himself, and almost automatically, I introduce myself as Lulu. It\u2019s almost as if I\u2019ve become her. Maybe I have. Never in a million years would Allyson have done what I just did.</p><p>Captain Jack and Willem untie the line, and I\u2019m about to say that maybe I should get some of my money back if Willem is going to play first mate but then I see that Willem is bounding about, having a blast. He clearly knows his way around a boat.</p><p>The barge chugs out of the broad basin, giving a wide view of a white-columned old building and a silver-domed modern-looking one. The Danes return to their poker game.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lose all your money,\u201d Captain Jack calls to them. \u201cOr you won\u2019t have any left to lose to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I slip away to the bow of the boat and watch the scenery slip by. It\u2019s cooler down here in the canals, under the narrow arched footbridges. And it smells different too. Older, mustier, like generations of history are stored in the wet walls. If these walls could talk, I wonder what secrets they\u2019d tell.</p><p>When we get to the first lock, Willem clambers to the side of the barge to show me how the mechanism works. The ancient-looking metal gates, rusted the same brackish color as the water, close behind us, the water drains out from beneath us, the gates reopen to a lower section.</p><p>This part of the canal is so narrow that the barge takes up almost the entire width. Steep embankments lead up to the streets, and above those, poplar and elm trees (per Captain Jack) form an arbor, a gentle respite from the hot afternoon sun.</p><p>A gust of wind shakes the trees, sending a scrim of leaves shimmying onto the deck. \u201cRain is coming,\u201d Captain Jack says, sniffing the air like a rabbit. I look up and then over at Willem and roll my eyes. The sky is cloudless, and there hasn\u2019t been rain in this part of Europe for ten days.</p> <p>Up above, Paris carries on, doing her thing. Mothers sip coffee, keeping eyes on their kids as they scooter along the sidewalks. Vendors at outdoor stalls hawk fruits and vegetables. Lovers wrap their arms around each other, never mind the heat. A clarinet player stands atop the bridge, serenading it all.</p><p>I\u2019ve hardly taken any pictures on this trip. Melanie teased me about it, to which I always said I preferred to experience something rather than obsessively record it. Though, really, the truth of it was, unlike Melanie (who wanted to remember the shoe salesman and the mime and the cute waiter and all the other people on the tour), none of that really mattered to me. At the start of the trip, I took shots of the sights. The Colosseum. Belvedere Palace. Mozart Square. But I stopped. They never came out very well, and you could get postcards of these things.</p><p>But there are no postcards of this. Of life.</p><p>I snap a picture of a bald man walking four bushy-haired dogs. Of a little girl in the most absurdly frilly skirt, plucking petals off a flower. Of a couple, unabashedly making out on the fake beach along the waterside. Of the Danes, ignoring all of this, but having the time of their lives playing cards.</p><p>\u201cOh, let me take one of the two of you,\u201d Agnethe says, rising, a little wobbly, from the game. \u201cAren\u2019t you golden?\u201d She turns to the table. \u201cBert, was I ever that golden?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou still are, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been married?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThirteen years,\u201d she says, and I\u2019m wondering if they\u2019re stained, but then she adds, \u201cOf course, we\u2019ve been divorced for ten.\u201d</p><p>She sees the look of confusion on my face. \u201cOur divorce is more successful than most marriages.\u201d</p><p>I turn to Willem. \u201cWhat kind of stain is that?\u201d I whisper, and he laughs just as Agnethe takes the picture.</p><p>A church bell rings in the distance. Agnethe hands back the phone, and I take a picture of her and Bert. \u201cYou will send me that one? All of the ones?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. As soon as I have reception.\u201d I turn to Willem. \u201cI\u2019ll text them to you too, if you give me your number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy phone is so old, it doesn\u2019t work with pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I get home, then, I\u2019ll put the pictures on my computer and email them to you,\u201d I say, though I\u2019ll have to figure out a place to hide the pictures from Mom; it wouldn\u2019t be beyond her to look through my phone\u2014or computer. Though, I realize now, only for another month. And then I\u2019ll be free. Just like today I\u2019m free.</p><p>He looks at one of the pictures for a long time. Then he looks at me. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you up here.\u201d He taps his temple. \u201cWhere you can\u2019t get lost.\u201d</p><p>I bite my lip to hide my smile and pretend to put the phone away, but when Captain Jack calls to Willem to take the wheel while he visits the head, I pull it back out and scroll through the photos, stopping at the one of the two of us that Agnethe took. I\u2019m in profile, my mouth open. He\u2019s laughing. Always laughing. I run my thumb over his face, halfway expecting it to emanate some sort of heat.</p><p>I put the phone away and watch Paris drift by, feeling relaxed, almost drunk with a sleepy joy. After a while, Willem returns to me. We sit quietly, listening to the lapping of the water, the babble of the Danes. Willem pulls a coin out and does that thing, flipping it from knuckle to knuckle. I watch, hypnotized by his hand, by the gentle rocking of the water. It\u2019s peaceful until the Danes start bickering, loudly. Willem translates: Apparently they\u2019re hotly debating whether some famous French actress has ever made a p**n ographic film.</p><p>\u201cYou speak Danish too?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s just close to Dutch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow many languages do you speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFluently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. I\u2019m sorry I asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour fluently. I get by in German and Spanish too.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, amazed.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you said you speak Chinese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I speak it so much as murder it. I\u2019m kind of tone deaf, and Mandarin is all about tone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me hear.\u201d</p><p>I look at him. \u201cNi zhen shuai.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWo xiang wen ni.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I hear it.\u201d He covers his head. \u201cStop. I\u2019m bleeding from my ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up or you will be.\u201d I pretend to shove him.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I give him a look. No way I\u2019m telling.</p><p>\u201cYou just made it up.\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cYou\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to look it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you write it too?\u201d He pulls out his little black book and opens to a blank page near the back. He rifles back into his bag. \u201cDo you have a pen?\u201d</p><p>I have one of those fancy roller balls I swiped from my dad, this one emblazoned BREATHE EASY WITH PULMOCLEAR. I write the character for sun, moon, stars. Willem nods admiringly.</p><p>\u201cAnd look, I love this one. It\u2019s double happiness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee how the characters are symmetrical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDouble happiness,\u201d Willem repeats, tracing the lines with his index finger.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a popular phrase. You\u2019ll see it on restaurants and things. I think it has to do with luck. In China, it\u2019s apparently big at weddings. Probably because of the story of its origin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA young man was traveling to take a very important exam to become a minister. On the way, he gets sick in a mountain village. So this mountain doctor takes care of him, and while he\u2019s recovering, he meets the doctor\u2019s daughter, and they fall in love. Right before he leaves, the girl tells him a line of verse. The boy heads off to the capital to take his exam and does well, and the emperor\u2019s all impressed. So, I guess to test him further, he says a line of verse. Of course, the boy immediately recognizes this mysterious line as the other half of the couplet the girl told him, so he repeats what the girl said. The emperor\u2019s doubly impressed, and the boy gets the job. Then he goes back and marries the girl. So, double happiness, I guess. He gets the job and the girl. You know, the Chinese are very big on luck.\u201d</p><p>Willem shakes his head. \u201cI think the double happiness is the two halves finding each other. Like the couplet.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never thought of it, but of course that\u2019s what it is.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember how it goes?\u201d Willem asks.</p><p>I nod. \u201cGreen trees against the sky in the spring rain while the sky set off the spring trees in the obscuration. Red flowers dot the land in the breeze\u2019s chase while the land colored up in red after the kiss.\u201d</p><p>The final section of the canal is underground. The walls are arched, and so low that I can reach up and touch the slick, wet bricks. It\u2019s eerie, hushed but echoey down here. Even the boisterous Danes have shushed. Willem and I sit with our legs dangling over the edge of the boat, kicking the side of the tunnel wall when we can.</p><p>He nudges my ankle with his toe. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor arranging this.\u201d He gestures to the boat.</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure. Thank you for arranging this.\u201d I point above us, to where Paris is no doubt going about its business.</p><p>\u201cAny time.\u201d He looks around. \u201cIt\u2019s nice, this. The canal.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet you say that to all the canals.\u201d But I flush in the musty, rich darkness.</p><p>We stay like that for the rest of the ride, swinging our legs against the side of the boat, listening as the odd bit of laughter or music from Paris seeps underground. It feels like the city is telling secrets down here, privy only to those who think to listen.</p><p>Eight</p><p>Arsenal Marina is like a parking lot for boats, tightly packed into cement piers on both sides of the water. Willem helps Captain Jack guide the barge into its narrow mooring, hopping out to tie the lines in complicated knots. We bid farewell to the Danes, who are now truly soused, and I take down Agnethe\u2019s cell phone number, promising to text her the pictures as soon as I can.</p><p>As we get off, Captain Jack shakes our hands. \u201cI feel a little bad to take your money,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t feel bad.\u201d I think of the look on Willem\u2019s face, of being in the tunnel. That alone was worth a hundred bucks.</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ll take it off you soon enough,\u201d Gustav calls.</p><p>Jacques shrugs. He kisses my hand before he helps me off the boat, and he practically hugs Willem.</p><p>As we walk away, Willem taps my shoulder. \u201cDid you see what the boat is named?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s right on the back, etched in blue lettering, next to the vertical red, white, and blue stripes of the French flag. Viola. Deauville.</p><p>\u201cViola? After Shakespeare\u2019s Viola?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Jacques meant for it be called Voil\u00e0, but his cousin painted it wrong, and he liked the name, so he registered her as Viola.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkaaay\u2014that\u2019s still a little weird,\u201d I say.</p><p>As always, Willem smiles.</p><p>\u201cAccidents?\u201d Immediately, a strange little tremor goes up my spine.</p><p>Willem nods, almost solemnly. \u201cAccidents,\u201d he confirms.</p><p>\u201cBut what does it mean? Does it mean we were meant to take that boat? Does it mean something better or worse would\u2019ve happened to us if we hadn\u2019t taken that boat? Did taking that boat alter the course of our lives? Is life really that random?\u201d</p><p>Willem just shrugs.</p><p>\u201cOr does it mean that Jacques\u2019s cousin can\u2019t spell?\u201d I say.</p><p>Willem laughs again. The sound is clear and strong as a bell, and it fills me with joy, and it\u2019s like, for the first time in my life, I understand that this is the point of laughter, to spread happiness.</p><p>\u201cSometimes you can\u2019t know until you know,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very helpful.\u201d</p><p>He laughs and looks at me for a long moment. \u201cYou know, I think you might be good at traveling after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? I\u2019m not. Today is a total anomaly. I was miserable on the tour. Trust me, I didn\u2019t flag down a single boat. Not even a taxi. Not even a bicycle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about before the tour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t traveled much, and the kind I\u2019ve done . . . not a lot of room for accidents.\u201d</p><p>Willem raises a questioning eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been places. Florida. Skiing. And to Mexico, but even that sounds more exotic than it is. Every year, we go to this time-share resort south of Canc\u00fan. It\u2019s meant to look like a giant Mayan temple, but I swear the only clue that you\u2019re not in America is the piped-in mariachi Christmas carols along the fake river waterslide thing. We stay in the same unit. We go to the same beach. We eat at the same restaurants. We barely even leave the gates, and when we do, it\u2019s to visit the ruins, but we go to the same ones every single year. It\u2019s like the calendar flips but nothing else changes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSame, same, but different,\u201d Willem says.</p><p>\u201cMore like same, same, but same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time when you go to Canc\u00fan, you can sneak out into the real Mexico,\u201d he suggests. \u201cTempt fate. See what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I allow, just imagining my mom\u2019s response if I suggested a little freelance traveling.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go to Mexico one day,\u201d Willem says. \u201cI\u2019ll bump into you, and we\u2019ll escape into the wilds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that would happen? We\u2019d just randomly bump into each other?\u201d</p><p>Willem lifts his hands up in the air. \u201cThere would have to be another accident. A big one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re saying that I\u2019m an accident?\u201d</p><p>His smile stretches like caramel. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p> <p>I rub my toe against the curb. I think of my Ziploc bags. I think of the color-coded schedule of all my activities that we\u2019ve kept tacked to the fridge since I was, like, eight. I think of my neat files with all my college application materials. Everything ordered. Everything planned. I look at Willem, so the opposite of that, of me, today, also the opposite of that.</p><p>\u201cI think that might possibly be one of the most flattering things anyone has ever said to me.\u201d I pause. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what that says about me, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says that you haven\u2019t been flattered enough.\u201d</p><p>I bow and give a sweeping be-my-guest gesture.</p><p>He stops and looks at me, and it\u2019s like his eyes are scanners. I have that same sensation I did on the train earlier, that he\u2019s appraising me, only this time not for looks and black-market value, but for something else.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say that you\u2019re pretty, because that dog already did. And I won\u2019t say you\u2019re funny, because you have had me laughing since I met you.\u201d</p> <p>Evan used to tell me that he and I were \u201cso compatible,\u201d as if being like him was the highest form of praise. Pretty and funny\u2014Willem could stop right there, and it would be enough.</p><p>But he doesn\u2019t stop there. \u201cI think you\u2019re the sort of person who finds money on the ground and waves it in the air and asks if anyone has lost it. I think you cry in movies that aren\u2019t even sad because you have a soft heart, though you don\u2019t let it show. I think you do things that scare you, and that makes you braver than those adrenaline junkies who bungee-jump off bridges.\u201d</p><p>He stops then. I open my mouth to say something, but nothing comes out and there\u2019s a lump in my throat and for one small second, I\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to cry.</p><p>Because I\u2019d hoped for baubles, trinkets, fizzy things: You have a nice smile. You have pretty legs. You\u2019re sexy.</p><p>But what he said . . . I did once turn in forty dollars I found at the food court to mall security. I have cried in every single Jason Bourne movie. As for the last thing he said, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true. But I hope more than anything that it is.</p><p>\u201cWe should get going,\u201d I say, clearing my throat. \u201cIf we want to get to the Louvre. How far is it from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe a few kilometers. But it\u2019s fast by bike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to wave one down?\u201d I joke.</p> <p>\u201cNo, we\u2019ll just get a V\u00e9lib\u2019.\u201d Willem looks around and walks toward a stand of gray bicycles. \u201cHave you ever heard of the White Bicycle?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I shake my head, and Willem starts explaining how for a brief time in Amsterdam in the 1960s, there used to be white bicycles, and they were free and everywhere. When you wanted a bike, you grabbed one, and when you were done, you left it. But it didn\u2019t work because there weren\u2019t enough bikes, and people stole them. \u201cIn Paris, you can borrow a bike for free for a half hour, but you have to lock it back up, or you get charged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think I just read they started something like this back home. So, it\u2019s free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you need is a credit card for the deposit.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have a credit card\u2014well, not one that doesn\u2019t link back to my parents\u2019 account, but Willem has his bank card, though he says he isn\u2019t sure if there\u2019s enough. When he runs it through the little keypad, one of the bikes unlocks, but when he tries it again for a second bike, the card is declined. I\u2019m not entirely disappointed. Cycling around Paris, sans helmet, seems vaguely suicidal.</p><p>But Willem\u2019s not replacing the bike. He\u2019s wheeling it over to where I\u2019m standing and raising the seat. He looks at me. Then pats the saddle.</p><p>\u201cWait, you want me to ride the bike?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll what? Run alongside me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll ride you.\u201d His eyebrows shoot up, and I feel myself blush. \u201cOn the bike,\u201d he clarifies.</p><p>I climb onto the wide seat. Willem steps in front of me. \u201cWhere exactly are you going to go?\u201d I ask</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. You just get comfortable,\u201d he says, as if it\u2019s possible in the current situation, with his back inches from my face, so close I can feel the heat radiating off of him, so close I can smell the new-clothes aroma of his T-shirt mingling with the light musk of his sweat. He puts one foot on one of the pedals. Then he turns around, an impish grin on his face. \u201cWarn me if you see police. This isn\u2019t quite legal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what\u2019s not legal?\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019s already pushed off. I shut my eyes. This is insane. We\u2019re going to die. And then my parents really will kill me.</p><p>A block later, we\u2019re still alive. I squint an eye open. Willem is leaning all the way forward over handlebars, effortlessly standing on the pedals, while I lean back, my legs dangling alongside the rear wheel. I open my other eye, release my clammy grip on the hem of his T-shirt. The marina is well behind us, and we are on a regular street, in a bike lane, cruising along with all the other gray bicycles.</p><p>We turn onto a choked street full of construction, half the avenue blocked by scaffolding and blockades, and I\u2019m looking at all the graffiti; the SOS, just like on the T-shirt for that band Sous ou Sur is scrawled there. I\u2019m about to point it out to Willem, but then I turn in the other direction and there\u2019s the Seine. And there\u2019s Paris. Postcard Paris! Paris from French Kiss and from Midnight in Paris and from Charade and every other Paris film I\u2019ve ever seen. I gape at the Seine, which is rippling in the breeze and glimmering in the early-evening sun. Down the expanse of it, I can see a series of arched bridges, draped like expensive bracelets over an elegant wrist. Willem points out Notre Dame Cathedral, just towering there, in the middle of an island in the middle of a river, like it\u2019s nothing. Like it\u2019s any other day, and it\u2019s not the freaking Notre Dame! We pass by another building, a wedding-cake confection that looks like it might house royalty. But, no, it\u2019s just City Hall.</p><p>It\u2019s funny how on the tour, we often saw sights like this as we whizzed by on a bus. Ms. Foley would stand at the front of the coach, microphone in hand, and tell us facts about this cathedral or that opera house. Sometimes, we\u2019d stop and go in, but with one or two days per city, most of the time, we drove on by.</p><p>I\u2019m driving by them now too. But somehow, it feels different. Like, being here, outside, on the back of this bike, with the wind in my hair and the sounds singing in my ears and the centuries-old cobblestones rattling beneath my butt, I\u2019m not missing anything. On the contrary, I\u2019m inhaling it, consuming it, becoming it.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how to account for the change, for all the changes today. Is it Paris? Is it Lulu? Or is it Willem? Is it his nearness that makes the city so intoxicating or the city that makes his nearness so irresistible?</p><p>A loud whistle cuts through my reverie, and the bike comes to an abrupt halt.</p><p>\u201cRide\u2019s over,\u201d Willem says. I hop off, and Willem starts wheeling the bicycle down the street.</p><p>A policeman with a thin mustache and a constipated expression comes chasing after us. He starts yelling at Willem, gesticulating, wagging a finger at me. His face is turning a bright red, and when he pulls out his little book and starts pointing to me and Willem, I get nervous. I thought Willem had been joking about the illegal thing.</p><p>Then Willem says something to the cop that stops the tirade cold.</p><p>The cop starts nattering on, and I don\u2019t understand a word, except I\u2019m pretty sure he says \u201cShakespeare!\u201d while holding a finger up in an aha motion. Willem nods, and the cop\u2019s tone softens. He still wagging his finger at us, but the little book goes back into his satchel. With a tip of his funny little hat, he walks away.</p><p>\u201cDid you just quote Shakespeare to a cop?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Willem nods.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s crazier: That Willem did that. Or that the cops here know Shakespeare.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLa beaut\u00e9 est une enchanteresse, et la bonne foi qui s\u2019expose \u00e0 ses charmes se dissout en sang,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s from Much Ado About Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d</p><p>Willem gives me that look of his, licks his lips, smiles. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to look it up.\u201d</p><p>We walk along the river and onto a main road full of restaurants, art galleries, and high-end boutiques. Willem parks the bike in a stand, and we take off on foot under a long portico and then make a few more turns into what, at first, seems like it should be a presidential residence or a royal palace, Versailles or something, the buildings are so huge and grand. Then I spot the glass pyramid in the middle of the courtyard, so I know we have arrived at the Louvre.</p><p>It\u2019s mobbed. Thousands of people are flooding out of the buildings, like they\u2019re evacuating it, clutching poster tubes and large black-and-white shopping bags. Some are energized, chatty, but many more look shell-shocked, weary, glazed after a day spent ingesting epic portions of Culture! I know that look. The Teen Tours! brochure bragged that it offered \u201cyoung people the full-on European immersion experience! We\u2019ll expose your teen to a maximum number of cultures in a short period of time, broadening their view of history, language, art, heritage, cuisine.\u201d It was supposed to be enlightening, but it mostly felt exhausting.</p><p>So when we discover that the Louvre just closed, I\u2019m actually relieved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Willem says.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if this qualifies as an accident or not, but I\u2019m happy either way.</p><p>We do an about-face and cross over a bridge and turn up the other bank of the river. Alongside the embankment there are all kinds of vendors selling books and old magazines, pristine issues of Paris Match with Jackie Kennedy on the cover and old pulp paperbacks with lurid covers, titled in both English and French. There\u2019s one vendor with a bunch of bric-a-brac, old vases, costume jewelry, and in a box on the side, a collection of dusty vintage alarm clocks. I paw through and find a vintage SMI in Bakelite. \u201cTwenty euro,\u201d the kerchiefed saleslady says to me. I try to keep a poker face. Twenty euro is about thirty bucks. The clock is easily worth two hundred dollars.</p><p>\u201cDo you want it?\u201d Willem asks.</p><p>My mom would go nuts if I brought this home, and she\u2019d never have to know where it was from. The woman winds the clock, to show me that it works, but hearing it tick, I\u2019m reminded of what Jacques said, about time being fluid. I look out at the Seine, which is now glowing pink, reflecting the color of the clouds that are rolling in. I put the clock back in the box.</p><p>We head up off the embankment, into the twisty, narrow warren of streets that Willem tells me is the Latin Quarter, where students live. It\u2019s different over here. Not so many grand avenues and boulevards but alley-like lanes, barely wide enough for even the tiny, space-age two-person Smart Cars that are zooming around everywhere. Tiny churches, hidden corners, alleys. It\u2019s a whole different Paris. And just as dazzling.</p><p>\u201cShall we take a drink?\u201d Willem asks.</p><p>I nod. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We cross onto a crowded avenue, full of cinemas, outdoor caf\u00e9s, all of them packed, and also a handful of small hotels, not too expensive judging by the prices advertised on the sandwich boards. Most of the signs say complet, which I\u2019m pretty sure means full, but some don\u2019t, and some of the rooms we might be able to afford if I were to exchange the last of my cash, about forty pounds.</p><p>I haven\u2019t been able to broach tonight with Willem. Where we\u2019re staying. He hasn\u2019t seemed too worried about it, which has me worried our fallback is C\u00e9line. We pass an exchange bureau. I tell Willem I want to change some money.</p><p>\u201cI have some money left,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you just paid for the boat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t have a single euro on me. What if I wanted to, I don\u2019t know, buy a postcard?\u201d I stop to spin a postcard caddy. \u201cAlso, there\u2019s drinks and dinner, and we\u2019ll need somewhere for, for . . .\u201d I trail off before getting the courage to finish. \u201cTonight.\u201d I feel my neck go warm.</p> <p>The word seems to hang out there as I wait for Willem\u2019s response, some clue of what he\u2019s thinking. But he\u2019s looking over at one of the caf\u00e9s, where a group of girls at a table seem to be waving at him. Finally, he turns back to me. \u201cSorry?\u201d he asks.</p><p>The girls are still waving. One of them is beckoning him over. \u201cDo you know them?\u201d</p><p>He looks over at the caf\u00e9, then back at me, then back at the restaurant. \u201cCan you wait here for a minute?\u201d</p><p>My stomach sinks. \u201cYeah, no problem.\u201d</p><p>He leaves me at a souvenir shop, where I spin the postcard caddy and spy. When he gets to the group of girls, they do the cheek-cheek-kiss-kiss thing\u2014three times, though, instead of twice like he did with C\u00e9line. He sits down next to the girl who was gesturing to him. It\u2019s clear they know each other; she keeps putting her hand on his knee. He throws darting glances in my direction, and I wait for him to wave me over, but he doesn\u2019t, and after an endless five minutes, the touchy girl writes something down on a bit of paper and gives it to him. He jams the slip deep into his pocket. Then he stands up, and they do another cheek-cheek-kiss-kiss thing, and he strides back to me, where I am feigning a deep interest in a Toulouse-Lautrec postcard.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he says as he grabs my elbow.</p><p>\u201cFriends of yours?\u201d I ask, jogging to keep up with his long stride.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew them once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just randomly bumped into them?\u201d</p> <p>He spins toward me, and for the first time today, he\u2019s annoyed. \u201cIt\u2019s Paris, Lulu, the most touristy city in the world. It happens.\u201d</p><p>Accidents, I think. But I feel jealous, possessive, not just over the girl\u2014whose number, I suspect, he now has in his hip pocket if he hasn\u2019t already transcribed it into his little black book\u2014but over accidents. Because today it has felt like accidents belonged solely to us.</p><p>Willem softens. \u201cThey\u2019re just people I knew from Holland.\u201d</p><p>Something in Willem\u2019s whole demeanor has changed, like a lamp whose bulb is dimming before it burns out. And it\u2019s then that I notice the final and defeated way he says Holland, and it makes me realize that all day along, not once has he said he was going home. And then another thought hits me. Today, he was meant to be going home\u2014or to Holland, where he\u2019s from\u2014for the first time in two years.</p><p>In three days, I will go home, and there will be a crowd at the airport. Back at my house, there will be a welcome-home banner, a celebratory dinner I\u2019ll probably be too jet-lagged to eat. After only three weeks on a tour in which I was led around like a show pony, I\u2019ll be given a hero\u2019s welcome.</p><p>He\u2019s been gone two years. Why isn\u2019t Willem getting a hero\u2019s welcome? Is anyone even waiting for him?</p><p>\u201cWhen we were at C\u00e9line\u2019s,\u201d I ask him now, \u201cdid you call anyone?\u201d</p><p>He turns to me, his dark eyes furrowed and confused. \u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p> <p>Because how does anyone know you\u2019re delayed? Because how do they know to postpone your hero\u2019s welcome until tomorrow?</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t anyone expecting you?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Something happens to his face, for just the slightest of moments, a slip of his jaunty mask, which I hadn\u2019t realized was a mask until I see how tired, how uncertain\u2014how much like me\u2014he looks underneath it.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think?\u201d Willem asks.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got news for you, but I\u2019ve been lost all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is different. This is getting on purpose lost. It\u2019s something I do when I first come to a new city. I\u2019ll go into the metro or on a tramline and randomly pick a stop and go.\u201d</p><p>I can see what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s changing the scenery, changing the subject. And I get that, in some way, he needs to do this. So I let him. \u201cLike traveler\u2019s pin the tail on the donkey?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Willem gives me a quizzical look. His English is so good that I forget not everything computes.</p><p>\u201cIs this about accidents?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He looks at me, and for half a second, the mask slips again. But then just like that, it\u2019s back in place. It doesn\u2019t matter. It slipped, and I saw. And I understand. Willem is alone, like I am alone. And now this ache that I can\u2019t quite distinguish as his or mine has opened up inside of me.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always about the accidents,\u201d he says.</p><p>Nine</p><p>I pick a doozy.</p><p>Using the pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey strategy, I close my eyes and spin in front of the Metro map and land my finger on the benign-sounding Ch\u00e2teau Rouge.</p><p>When we come out of the Metro, we are in yet another Paris altogether, and there\u2019s not a chateau, rouge or otherwise, in sight.</p><p>The streets are narrow, like in the Latin Quarter, but grittier. Tinny, drum-heavy music blares out from the shop windows, and there\u2019s such an onslaught of smells, my nose doesn\u2019t know what to breathe first: curry coming out of the patisseries, the ferric tang of blood from the giant animal carcasses being trundled through the street, the sweet and exotic smell of incense smoke, exhaust from the cars and motos, the ubiquitous smell of coffee\u2014though there aren\u2019t so many of the big caf\u00e9s here, the kind that take up an entire corner, but more smaller, ad-hoc ones, bistro tables shoved onto the sidewalk. And they\u2019re all packed with men smoking and drinking coffee. The women, some wearing full black veils with only their eyes showing through the slits, others in colorful dresses, sleeping babies tied to their backs, bustle in and out of the stores. We are the only tourists in this area, and people are looking at us, not menacingly, but just curiously, like we\u2019re lost. Which we are. This is precisely why, on my own, I would never in a million years do this.</p><p>But Willem is loving it here. So I try to take a cue from him and relax, and just gape at this part of Paris meets Middle East meets Africa.</p><p>We go past a mosque, then a hulking church, all spires and buttresses, that seems like it landed in this neighborhood the same way we did. We twist and turn until we wind up in some sort of park: a quadrangle of grass and paths and handball courts sandwiched in between the apartment buildings. It\u2019s packed with girls in head scarves playing some version of hopscotch and boys on the handball courts and people walking dogs and playing chess and sitting out for a smoke at the end of a summer afternoon.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea where we are?\u201d I ask Willem.</p><p>\u201cI am as lost as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we are so screwed.\u201d But I laugh. It feels kind of nice to be lost, together.</p><p>We flop down under a stand of trees in a quiet corner of the park under a mural of children playing in the clouds. I slide off my sandals. I have tan lines made from dirt and sweat. \u201cI think my feet are broken.\u201d</p><p>Willem kicks off his flip-flops. I see the zigzag scar running up his left foot. \u201cMine too.\u201d</p><p>We lie on our backs as the sun throws shadows down between the clouds that are really starting to roll in on the cooling breeze, bringing with them the electric smell of rain. Maybe Jacques was right, after all.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Willem asks.</p><p>I shut my eyes and stick my arm out for him to see. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me. I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>He takes my arm, checks the time. But then he doesn\u2019t let go. He examines my wrist, rotating it forward and back, as if it were some rare object, the first wrist he has ever seen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very nice watch,\u201d he says finally.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say dutifully.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not that. I mean, it was a really generous gift from my parents, who\u2019d already given me the tour, and it\u2019s a very expensive watch.\u201d I stop myself. It\u2019s Willem, and something compels me to tell him the truth. \u201cBut, no, I don\u2019t really like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s heavy. It makes my wrist sweaty. And it ticks loudly, like it\u2019s always trying to remind me that time is passing. Like I can\u2019t ever forget about time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why do you wear it?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s such a simple question. Why do I wear a watch that I hate? Even here, thousands of miles from home, with no one to see me wearing it, why do I still wear it? Because my parents bought it for me with the best of intentions. Because I can\u2019t let them down.</p><p>I feel the gentle pressure of Willem\u2019s fingers on my wrist again. The clasp opens, and the watch falls away, leaving a white ghost imprint. I can feel the refreshing breeze tickle against my birthmark.</p><p>Willem examines the watch, the Going Places engraving. \u201cWhere are you going, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you know. To Europe. To college. To medical school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMedical school?\u201d There\u2019s surprise in his voice.</p><p>I nod. That\u2019s been the plan ever since eighth grade, when I gave the Heimlich maneuver to some guy who was choking on his lamb shank at the next table. Dad had been out front, answering a call from the service when I\u2019d seen the guy next to us go purple. So I just got up and calmly put my arms around the guy\u2019s diaphragm and pushed until a piece of meat arced out. Mom was beyond impressed. She\u2019d started talking about my becoming a doctor like Dad. After a while, I started talking about it too.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll take care of me?\u201d</p><p>His voice has the usual teasing tone, so I get that he\u2019s joking, but this wave comes over me. Because who takes care of him now? I look at him, and he makes everything seem effortless, but I remember that feeling before\u2014a certainty\u2014that he is alone.</p><p>\u201cWho takes care of you now?\u201d</p><p>At first I\u2019m not sure I said it aloud and, if I did, that he heard me, because he doesn\u2019t answer for a long time. But then finally, he says, \u201cI take care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about when you can\u2019t? When you get sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverybody gets sick. What happens when you\u2019re on the road and you get the flu or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get sick. I get better,\u201d he replies, waving the question away.</p><p>I prop myself up on my elbow. This weird chasm of feeling has opened in my chest, making my breath come shallow and my words dance like scattered leaves. \u201cI keep thinking about the double happiness story. That boy was traveling alone and got sick, but someone took care of him. Is that what happens to you when you get sick? Or are you alone in some gross hotel room?\u201d I try to picture Willem in a mountain village, but all I get is an image of him in a dingy room. I think of how I get when I\u2019m sick, that deep sadness, that aloneness that strikes\u2014and I have Mom to take care of me. What about him? Does anyone bring him soup? Does anyone tell him about the green trees against the sky in the spring rain?</p><p>Willem doesn\u2019t answer. In the distance, I can hear the pop of the handball slamming against the wall, the coquettish sound of women\u2019s laughter. I think of C\u00e9line. The girls on the train. The models at the caf\u00e9. The slip of paper in his pocket. There\u2019s probably no shortage of girls wanting to play nurse with him. I get a weird feeling in my stomach. I\u2019ve made a wrong turn, like when I am skiing and I accidentally swerve onto a black-diamond run full of moguls. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just the doctor in me coming out. Or the Jewish mother.\u201d</p><p>Willem gives me a peculiar look. Another wrong turn. I keep forgetting that in Europe, there are hardly any Jewish people, so jokes like that don\u2019t make sense.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Jewish, and apparently that means when I get older, I\u2019m doomed to fuss about everyone\u2019s health,\u201d I hastily explain. \u201cThat\u2019s what \u2018Jewish mother\u2019 means.\u201d</p><p>Willem lies on his back and holds my watch up to his face. \u201cIt\u2019s strange you mention the double happiness story. Sometimes I do get sick and wind up puking into squat toilets, and it\u2019s not so nice.\u201d</p> <p>I wince at the thought of it.</p><p>\u201cBut there was this one time, I was traveling from Morocco to Algeria by bus, and I got dysentery, a pretty bad case. So bad I had no choice but to get off the bus in the middle of nowhere. It was some town at the edge of the Sahara, not even mentioned in any book. I was dehydrated, hallucinating, I think, stumbling around for a place to stay when I saw a hotel and restaurant called Saba. Saba was what I used to call my grandfather. It seemed like a sign, like he was saying \u2018go here.\u2019 The restaurant was empty. I went straight to the toilets to throw up again. When I came out, there was a man with a short gray beard wearing a long djellaba. I asked for some tea and ginger, which is what my mother always uses for upset stomachs. He shook his head and told me I was in the desert now and had to use desert remedies. He disappeared into the kitchen and returned with a grilled lemon, cut in half. He sprinkled it with salt and told me to squeeze the juice into my mouth. I thought I would lose it again, but in twenty minutes, my stomach was okay. He gave me some terrible tea that tasted like tree bark and sent me upstairs, where I slept maybe eighteen hours. Every day, I came downstairs, and he would ask how I was feeling and then prepare me a meal specifically based on my symptoms. After that we would talk, just as I had done with Saba as a child. I stayed there for a week, in this town on the edge of the map that I am not even sure exists. So it is a lot like your story from before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept he didn\u2019t have a daughter,\u201d I say. \u201cOr you\u2019d be married by now.\u201d</p><p>We are on our sides, facing each other, so close I can feel the warmth radiating off him, so close it\u2019s like we are breathing the same air.</p><p>\u201cYou be the daughter. Tell me that couplet again,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cGreen trees against the sky in the spring rain while the sky set off the spring trees in the obscuration. Red flowers dot the land in the breeze\u2019s chase while the land colored up in red after the kiss.\u201d</p><p>The last word, kiss, hangs in the air.</p><p>\u201cNext time I get sick, you can tell that to me. You can be my girl in the mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019ll be your mountain girl and take care of you.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, like it\u2019s another joke, another volley in our flirtation, and I smile back, even though I\u2019m not joking.</p><p>\u201cAnd in return, I will relieve you of the burden of time.\u201d He slips my watch onto his lanky wrist, where it doesn\u2019t seem quite so much like a prison shackle. \u201cFor now, time doesn\u2019t exist. It is, what did Jacques say . . . fluid?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFluid,\u201d I repeat, like an incantation. Because if time can be fluid, then maybe something that is just one day can go on indefinitely.</p><p>Ten</p><p>I fall asleep. And then I wake up, and everything feels different. The park is quiet now. The sound of laughter and echoes of handballs have disappeared into the long dusky twilight. Fat, gray rainclouds have overtaken the darkening sky.</p><p>But something else has shifted, something less quantifiable yet somehow elemental. I feel it as soon as I wake; the atoms and molecules have rearranged themselves, rendering the whole world irrevocably changed.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I notice Willem\u2019s hand.</p><p>Willem has also fallen asleep; his long body is curved in the space around mine like a question mark. We aren\u2019t touching at all except for his one hand, which is tucked into the crease of my hip, casually, like a dropped scarf, like it blew there on the soft breeze of sleep. And yet now that it\u2019s there, it feels like it belongs there. Like it\u2019s always belonged there.</p><p>I hold myself perfectly still, listening to the wind rustle through the trees, to the soft in-out of Willem\u2019s rhythmic breathing. I concentrate on his hand, which feels like it\u2019s delivering a direct line of electricity from his fingertips into some core part of me I didn\u2019t even know existed until just now.</p><p>Willem stirs in his sleep, and I wonder if he\u2019s feeling this too. How can he not? The electricity is so real, so palpable, that if someone waved a meter around, it would spin off the dial.</p> <p>He shifts again, and his fingertips dig in right there into that tender flesh in the hollow of my hip, sending a shock and a zing so deliciously intense that I buck, kicking his leg behind me.</p><p>I swear, somehow I can feel his eyelashes flutter open, followed by the heat of his breath against the back of my neck. \u201cGoeiemorgen,\u201d he says, his voice still pliant with sleep.</p><p>I roll over to face him, thankful that his hand remains slung over my hip. His ruddy cheeks bear little indentations from the grass, like tribal initiation scars. I want to touch them, to feel the grooves of his otherwise smooth skin. I want to touch every part of him. It\u2019s like his body is a giant sun, emitting its own gravitational pull.</p><p>\u201cI think that means good morning, though technically it\u2019s still evening.\u201d My words come out sounding gaspy. I\u2019ve forgotten how to talk and breathe at the same time.</p><p>\u201cYou forget, time doesn\u2019t exist anymore. You gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave it you,\u201d I repeat. There\u2019s such delicious surrender in the words, and I feel myself slipping away to him. Some small part of me warns against this. This is just one day. I am just one girl. But the part that can resist, that would resist, I woke up finally liberated of her.</p><p>Willem blinks at me, his eyes dark, lazy, and sexy. I can feel us kissing already. I can feel his lips all over me. I can feel the jut of his sharp hipbones against me. The park is almost deserted. There are a couple of younger girls in jeans and head scarves talking to some guys. But they are off in a corner of their own. And I don\u2019t care about propriety.</p><p>My thoughts must be like a movie projected on a screen. He watches it all. I can tell by his knowing smile. We inch closer to each other. Beneath the chirp of cicadas, I can practically hear the energy between us humming, like the power lines that buzz overhead in the countryside.</p><p>But then I hear something else. At first, I don\u2019t know how to place it, so discordant is it from the sounds in this bubble of electricity we are generating. But then I hear it a second time, cold and jagged and bracingly clear, and I know exactly what it is. Because fear needs no translation. A scream is the same in any language.</p><p>Willem jumps up. I jump up. \u201cStay here!\u201d he commands. And before I know what has happened, he is striding away on those long legs of his, leaving me whiplashed between lust and terror.</p><p>There\u2019s another scream. A girl\u2019s scream. Everything seems to slow down then, like a slow-motion sequence in a movie. I see the girls, the ones with the head scarves, there are two of them, only now one isn\u2019t wearing her scarf anymore. It is on the ground, revealing a fall of black hair that is wild and staticky, as if her hair is frightened too. She is huddled with the other girl, as if trying to disappear from the boys. Who I now see aren\u2019t boys at all, but are men, the kind who sport shaved heads, and combat fatigues, and big black boots. The essential wrongness of these men with these girls in this now-quiet park hits me all at once. I pick up Willem\u2019s backpack, which he\u2019s just abandoned there, and creep closer.</p><p>I hear the soft cries of one of the girls and the men\u2019s guttural laughter. Then they speak again. I never knew French could sound so ugly.</p><p>Just as I\u2019m wondering where he went, Willem steps between the men and the girls and starts saying something. He\u2019s speaking softly, but I can hear him all the way over here, which must be a kind of actor\u2019s trick. But he\u2019s also speaking in French, so I have no idea what he\u2019s saying. Whatever it is, it\u2019s gotten the skinheads\u2019 attention. They answer him back, in loud staccato voices that echo off the empty handball courts. Willem replies in a voice as calm and quiet as a breeze, and I strain to understand just a word of it, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>They go back and forth and as they do, the girls use the cover as it was intended and slip away. The skinheads don\u2019t even notice. Or don\u2019t care. It\u2019s Willem they are interested in now. At first, I think that Willem\u2019s powers of charm must know no bounds. That he has even made friends with skinheads. But then my ear attunes to the tone of what he is saying as opposed to the words. And I recognize the tone because it\u2019s one I\u2019ve been privy to all day. He\u2019s teasing them. He is mocking them in that way that I\u2019m not even sure they fully recognize. Because there are three of them and one of him, and if they knew what he was doing, they wouldn\u2019t still be standing there talking.</p><p>I can smell the sickly sweet odor of booze and the acrid tang of adrenaline, and all at once, I can feel what they are going to do to Willem. I can feel it as if they are going to do it to me. And this should paralyze me with fear. It doesn\u2019t. Instead it fills me with something hot and tender and vicious.</p><p>Who takes care of you?</p><p>Without even thinking about it, I\u2019m reaching into Willem\u2019s bag and grabbing the thickest thing I can find\u2014the Rough Guide\u2014and I\u2019m striding toward them. No one sees me coming, not even Willem, so I have the element of surprise on my side. Also, apparently, some serious fight-or-flight strength. Because when I hurl that book at that guy closest to Willem, the one holding a beer bottle, it hits him with such force that he drops the bottle. And when he raises his hand to his brow, there\u2019s a welt of blood blooming like a red flower.</p><p>I know I should be scared, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m oddly calm, happy to be back in Willem\u2019s presence after those interminable seconds apart. Willem, however, is staring at me wide-eyed and slack-jawed. The skinheads are looking right past me, surveying the park, as if they can\u2019t quite believe that I could be the source of the attack.</p><p>It\u2019s their moment of confusion that saves us. Because in that moment, Willem\u2019s hand finds mine. And we run.</p><p>Out of the park, past the church, and back into that crazy mishmash neighborhood, past the tea shops and caf\u00e9s and the animal carcasses. We leap over the overflowing gutters, past the congregation of motorcycles and bicycles, dodging delivery vans disgorging racks of clothing heavily bejeweled with glitter and sparkles.</p><p>The neighborhood\u2019s residents stop to watch us, parting to let us through like we are a spectator sport, an Olympic event\u2014the Crazy-White-People Chase.</p><p>I should be scared. I am being chased by angry skinheads; the only person who\u2019s ever run after me before is my dad when we\u2019ve gone out jogging. I can hear the clomp of their boots beat in time with the heartbeat in my head. But I\u2019m not scared. I feel my legs magically lengthen, allowing me to match Willem\u2019s long stride. I feel the ground undulating under our feet, as if it too is on our side. I feel like we are barely touching the earth, like we might just take off into the sky and run right over the Paris rooftops, where no one can ever touch us.</p><p>I hear them shouting behind us. I hear the sound of glass breaking. I hear something whizz past my ear and then something wet on my neck, as if my sweat glands have all opened up and released at once. And then I hear more laughter and the boot steps abruptly stop.</p><p>But Willem keeps going. He pulls me through the tiny jigsaw streets until they open up onto a large boulevard. We dash across as the light changes, running by a police car. It\u2019s crowded now. I\u2019m pretty sure we aren\u2019t being chased. We are safe. But still, Willem carries on running, yanking me this way and that down a series of smaller, quieter streets until, like a bookcase revealing a secret door, a gap in the streetscape emerges. It\u2019s the keypadded opening to one of those grand apartment houses. An old man with a wheeled cart leaves the inner courtyard just as Willem skids us into the entryway. Our momentum crashes from sixty to zero as we slam together against a stone wall just as the door clicks shut behind us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We stand there, our bodies pressed together, barely an inch of space separating us. I can feel the fast, steady thud of his heart, the sharp in-out of his breath. I can see the rivulet of perspiration trickling down his neck. I feel my blood, thrumming, like a river about to spill over its banks. It\u2019s as if my body can no longer contain me. I have become too big for it somehow.</p><p>\u201cWillem,\u201d I begin. There is so much I need to say to him.</p><p>He puts a finger up to my neck, and I fall silent, his touch at once calming and electrifying. But then he removes his finger and it\u2019s red with blood. I reach up to touch my neck. My blood.</p><p>\u201cGodverdomme!\u201d he swears under his breath. With one hand, he reaches into his backpack for a bandanna, and with the other, he licks the blood on his finger clean.</p> <p>He holds the bandanna against the side of my neck. I\u2019m definitely bleeding, but not badly. I\u2019m not even sure what happened.</p><p>\u201cThey threw a broken bottle at you.\u201d Willem\u2019s voice is pure fury.</p><p>But it doesn\u2019t hurt. I\u2019m not hurt. Not really. It\u2019s just a little nick.</p><p>He\u2019s standing so close to me now, gently pressing the bandanna against my neck. And then the cut on my neck is not the point of exit for blood, but the point of entry for this weird line of electricity that is surging between us.</p><p>I want him, all of him. I want to taste his mouth, his mouth that just tasted my blood. I lean into him.</p> <p>But he pushes me away, pulls himself back. His hand drops from my neck. The bandanna, now clotted with blood, hangs there limply.</p><p>I look up then, into his eyes. All the color has drained out of them, so they just seem black. But more disconcerting is what I see in them, something instantly recognizable: fear. And more than anything, I want to do something, to take that away. Because I should be scared. But today, I\u2019m not.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I begin. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking?\u201d he interrupts, his voice icy as a stranger\u2019s. And maybe it\u2019s that or maybe it\u2019s just relief, but now I feel like I might cry.</p><p>\u201cThey were going to hurt you,\u201d I say. My voice breaks. I look at him, to see if he understands, but his expression has only hardened, fear having been joined by its twin brother, anger. \u201cAnd I promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromised what?\u201d</p> <p>An instant replay runs through my head: No punches had been exchanged. I hadn\u2019t even been able to understand what they\u2019d been saying. But they were going to hurt him. I could feel it in my bones.</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019d take care of you.\u201d My voice goes quiet as the certainty drains out of me.</p><p>\u201cTake care of me? How does this take care of me?\u201d He opens his hand, which is stained with my blood.</p><p>He takes a step away from me, and with the twilight blinking between us now, it hits me how utterly wrong I have gotten this. I haven\u2019t just skied onto the diamond run; I\u2019ve flown off the face of the cliff. It was a joke, this request to take care of him. When have I ever taken care of anybody? And he certainly never said he needed taking care of.</p><p>We stand there, the silence curdling around us. The last of the sunlight slips away, and then, almost as if waiting for cover of darkness to sneak in, the rain starts to fall. Willem looks at the sky and then looks at his watch\u2014my watch\u2014still snug around his wrist.</p><p>I think of those forty pounds I have left. I imagine a quiet, clean hotel room. I think of us in it, not as I imagined it an hour before in that Paris park, but just quiet, listening to the rain. Please, I silently implore. Let\u2019s just go somewhere and make this better.</p><p>But then Willem is reaching into his bag for the Eurostar schedule. And then he\u2019s unclasping my watch. And then I realize, he\u2019s giving time back to me. Which really means he\u2019s taking it away.</p><p>Eleven</p> <p>There are two more trains back to London tonight. Willem tells me it\u2019s after nine, so there\u2019s probably not enough time for me to exchange my ticket and get on the next one, but I can definitely catch the last train. Because I gain an hour back going to England, I should get to London just before the Tube stops running. Willem tells me all this in a friendly helpful way, like I\u2019m a stranger on the street who stopped him for directions. And I nod along, like I\u2019m the kind of person who actually takes the Tube alone, day or night.</p><p>He is oddly formal as he opens the door to the apartment courtyard for me, like he\u2019s letting the dog out for its nightly pee. It\u2019s late, the night edge of the long summer twilight, and the Paris I walk out into seems wholly changed from the one I left a half hour ago, though once again, I know that it\u2019s not the rain or all the lights that have come on. Something has shifted. Or maybe shifted back. Or maybe it never shifted in the first place and I was just fooling myself.</p><p>Still, seeing this new Paris, it brings tears to my eyes that turn all the lights into a big red scar. I wipe my face with my dampening cardigan, my returned watch still grasped in my hand. Somehow I cannot bear to put it back on. It feels like it would hurt me, far more than the cut on my neck. I attempt to walk ahead of Willem, to put space between us.</p><p>\u201cLulu,\u201d he calls after me.</p><p>I don\u2019t answer. That\u2019s not me. It never was.</p><p>He jogs to catch up. \u201cI think Gare du Nord is that way.\u201d He takes me by the elbow, and I steel myself against the zing, but, like tensing against a doctor\u2019s shot, that only makes it worse.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me how to get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you follow this street for a few blocks and then turn left. But first we have to go to C\u00e9line\u2019s club.\u201d</p><p>Right. C\u00e9line. He\u2019s acting so normal now, not normal like Willem, but normal compared to how he was twenty minutes ago, the fear gone out of his eyes, replaced with some kind of relief. The relief of unloading me. I wonder if this was always the plan. Drop me off and circle back for C\u00e9line for the evening shift. Or maybe it\u2019s the other girl, the one whose number is sitting snugly in his hip pocket. With so many options, why would he choose me?</p><p>You\u2019re a good kid. That\u2019s what my crush, Shane Michaels, had told me when I\u2019d come as close as I ever would to admitting my feelings for him. You\u2019re a good kid. That\u2019s me. Shane used to hold my hand and say flirty, sweet things. I\u2019d always thought it meant something. And then he went off with some other girl and did things that actually did mean something.</p><p>We follow a large boulevard back toward the station, but after a few blocks, we turn back off into the smaller streets. I look for the club, but this isn\u2019t an industrial neighborhood. It\u2019s residential, full of apartment houses, their flowering window boxes soaking up the rain, their fat cats happily dozing inside closed windows. There\u2019s a restaurant on the corner, its fogged-up windows glowing. Even from across the street, I can make out the sound of laughter and silverware clanking against plates. People, dry and warm, enjoying a Thursday-night dinner in Paris.</p><p>The rain is coming down harder now. My sweater is soaking through to my T-shirt. I pull the sleeves down over my fists. My teeth start to chatter; I clench my jaw to keep it from showing, but that just detours the shivering to the rest of my body. I pull the bandanna off my neck. The bleeding has stopped, but my neck is now grimy with blood and sweat.</p><p>Willem looks at me with dismay, or maybe it\u2019s disgust. \u201cWe need to clean you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have clean clothes in my suitcase.\u201d</p><p>Willem peers at my neck and winces. Then he takes my elbow and crosses the street and opens the door to the restaurant. Inside, candlelight flickers, illuminating the wine bottles lined up against a zinc bar and the menus scribbled on little chalkboards. I stop at the threshold. We don\u2019t belong in here.</p><p>\u201cWe can clean your cut here. See if they have an emergency kit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it on the train.\u201d Mom packed me a first-aid kit, naturally.</p><p>We just stand there, facing off. A waiter appears. I expect him to ream us out for letting in the chilly air, or for looking like dirty, bloodied riffraff. But he ushers me inside like he\u2019s the host to a party, and I\u2019m the guest of honor. He sees my neck, and his eyes go wide. Willem says something in French, and he nods at once, gesturing to a corner table.</p><p>The restaurant is warm, the air tangy with onions and sweet with vanilla, and I am too defeated to resist. I slump down into a chair, covering my cut with one hand. My other hand relaxes and releases my watch onto the white cloth, where it ticks malevolently.</p><p>The waiter returns with a small, white first-aid box and a blackboard menu. Willem opens the kit and pulls out a medicated wipe, but I snatch it from him.</p><p>\u201cI can do it myself!\u201d I say.</p><p>I dab the wound with ointment and cover it with an oversize bandage. The waiter returns to check my work. He nods approvingly. Then he says something to me in French. \u201cHe\u2019s asking if you want to hang your sweater in the kitchen so it can dry,\u201d Willem says.</p><p>I have to fight the urge to bury my face into his long, crisp, white apron and weep with gratitude for his kindness. Instead, I hand over my soaked sweater. Underneath, my damp T-shirt clings to me; there are bloodstains on the collar. I have the T-shirt C\u00e9line gave me, the same obscure, too-cool-for-school band T-shirt Willem is wearing, but I\u2019d rather parade around in my bra than put that on. Willem says something else in French, and moments later, a large carafe of red wine is delivered to our table.</p><p>\u201cI thought I had a train to catch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have time to eat a little something.\u201d Willem pours a glass of wine and hands it to me.</p><p>I am technically of age to drink all over Europe, but I haven\u2019t, not even when, at some of the prepaid lunches, wine was offered as a matter of course and some of the kids sneaked glasses when Ms. Foley wasn\u2019t looking. Tonight, I don\u2019t hesitate. The wine glints shades of blood in the candlelight, and drinking it is like receiving a transfusion. The warmth goes from my throat to my stomach before setting to work on the chill that has settled in my bones. I drain half a glass in one go.</p><p>\u201cEasy there,\u201d Willem cautions.</p><p>I gulp the rest of it and thrust out my glass like a middle finger. Willem appraises me for a second, then fills the glass to the rim.</p><p>The waiter returns and makes a formal show of handing us a chalkboard menu and a basket of bread with a small silver ramekin.</p><p>\u201cEt pour vous, le p\u00e2t\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean, merci.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cDe rien.\u201d</p><p>Willem breaks off a piece of bread and spreads it with the brown paste and offers it to me. I just glare at him.</p><p>\u201cBetter than Nutella,\u201d he teases in an almost singsong voice.</p><p>Maybe it is the wine or the prospect of getting rid of me, but Willem, the Willem I\u2019ve been with all day, is back. And somehow, this makes me furious. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry,\u201d I say, even though I am, in fact, famished. I haven\u2019t eaten anything since that cr\u00eape. \u201cAnd it looks like dog food,\u201d I add for good measure.</p><p>\u201cJust try.\u201d He holds the bread and p\u00e2t\u00e9 up to my mouth. I snatch it from his hands, take a tiny sample. The flavor is both delicate and intense, like meat butter. But I refuse to give him the satisfaction of seeing me enjoy it. I nibble a bite and make a face. Then I put the bread back down again.</p><p>The waiter returns, sees our emptying wine carafe, gestures to it. Willem nods. He returns with a full one. \u201cThe sole is . . . it is finis,\u201d he says in English, wiping the entry off the chalkboard. He looks at me. \u201cYou are cold and have lost blood,\u201d he says, as if I hemorrhaged or something. \u201cI recommend something with force.\u201d He makes a fist. \u201cThe beef bourguignon is excellent. We also have a fish pot au feu, very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust keep it coming,\u201d I say, gesturing to the wine.</p><p>The waiter frowns slightly and looks to me, then Willem, like I am somehow their joint responsibility. \u201cMay I suggest to start, a salad with some asparagus and smoked salmon.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My traitorous stomach gurgles. Willem nods, then orders for both of us, the two things that the waiter recommended. He doesn\u2019t even bother to ask me what I want. Which is fine, because right now all I want is wine. I reach out for another glass, but Willem puts his hand on top of the opening of the carafe. \u201cYou have to eat something first,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s from duck, not pig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d I shove a whole piece of baguette and p\u00e2t\u00e9 into my mouth, defiantly and noisily chomping on it, hiding any satisfaction I\u2019m actually taking from it. Then I hold out my glass.</p><p>Willem looks at me for a long moment. But he does oblige with a refill and then that lazy half smile. In one day, I\u2019ve come to love that smile. And now I want to murder it.</p><p>We sit in silence until the waiter returns to deliver the salad with a flourish befitting the beautiful dish: a still life of pink salmon, green asparagus, yellow mustard sauce, and toast points scattered around the side of the plate like blossoms. My mouth waters, and it\u2019s like my body is waving the white flag, telling me to just give in, to quit while I\u2019m ahead, to accept the nice day I had, which really, is far more than I had any right to hope for. But there\u2019s another part of me that is still hungry, hungry not just for food, but for everything that\u2019s been laid out in front of me today. On behalf of that hungry girl, I refuse the salad.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re still upset,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so bad as I thought. It won\u2019t even scar.\u201d</p><p>Yes, it will. Even if it heals up next week, it\u2019ll scar, although maybe not in the way he means. \u201cYou think I\u2019m upset about this?\u201d I touch the bandage on my neck.</p><p>He won\u2019t look at me. He knows damn well I\u2019m not upset about that. \u201cLet\u2019s just eat something, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sending me back. Do what you have to do, but don\u2019t ask me to be happy about it.\u201d</p><p>Over the dancing candlelight, I see his expressions pass by like fast clouds: surprise, amusement, frustration, and tenderness\u2014or maybe it\u2019s pity. \u201cYou were going to leave tomorrow, so what\u2019s the difference?\u201d He brushes some bread crumbs off the tablecloth.</p> <p>The difference, Willem? The difference is the night.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d is my stellar reply.</p><p>\u201cWhatever?\u201d Willem asks. He runs his finger along the rim of his glass; it makes a low sound, like a foghorn. \u201cDid you think about what would happen?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s all I\u2019ve been thinking about, and all I\u2019ve been trying not to think about: What would happen tonight.</p><p>But again, I\u2019ve misunderstood him. \u201cDid you think about what would happen if they caught us?\u201d he continues.</p><p>I could feel what they wanted to do to him. I could taste their violence in my own mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s why I threw the book at them; they wanted to hurt you,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat did you say to them to get them so angry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were already angry,\u201d he says, evading my question. \u201cI just gave them a different reason.\u201d But by his answer and the look on his face, I can tell that I\u2019m not wrong. That they were going to hurt him. What I felt about that, at least, was real.</p><p>\u201cCan you imagine if they\u2019d caught us? You?\u201d Willem voice is so quiet I have to lean in to hear him. \u201cLook what they did.\u201d He reaches over as if to touch my neck, but then pulls back.</p><p>In the adrenaline of the chase and the weird euphoria that followed, I hadn\u2019t thought about them catching me. Maybe because it hadn\u2019t seemed possible. We had wings on our feet; they had leaden boots. But now, here, with Willem sitting across from me, wearing this strange, somber expression, with his bloody bandanna crumpled into a ball on the side of the table, I can hear those boots getting closer, can hear them stomping, can hear bones cracking.</p><p>\u201cBut they didn\u2019t catch us.\u201d I swallow the tremble in my voice with another gulp of wine.</p><p>He finishes his wine and stares at the empty glass for a moment. \u201cThis is not what I brought you here for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you bring me here for?\u201d Because he never answered that. Never said why he asked me to come to Paris with him for the day.</p><p>He rubs his eyes with the heel of his hands. When he removes his hands, he looks different somehow. Stripped bare of all the masks. \u201cNot for things to get out of control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, a little late for that.\u201d I\u2019m trying to be flip, to summon whatever dregs of Lulu I have left. But when I say it, the truth of it wallops me in the stomach. We, or at least, I, have long since passed the point of no return.</p> <p>I look back at him. His eyes lock on mine. The current clicks back on.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it is,\u201d Willem says.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Maybe Jacques was right, and time really is fluid. Because as we eat, my watch sits there on the table and seems to bend and distort like a Salvador Dal\u00ed painting. And then at one point, somewhere between the beef bourguignon and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, Willem reaches for it and looks at me for a long moment before slipping it back on his wrist. I feel this profound sense of relief. Not just that I\u2019m not being sent back to London tonight, but that he is taking charge of time again. My surrender is now complete.</p><p>It is late when we spill out onto the streets, and Paris has turned into a sepia-toned photograph. It\u2019s too late to get a hotel or youth hostel, and there\u2019s no money left, anyhow. I gave the rest of my cash, my forty pounds, to Willem to help pay for dinner. The waiter protested when we paid, not because we gave him a grab-bag of euros and pounds, but because we gave him the equivalent of a twenty-five-dollar tip. \u201cToo much,\u201d he protested.\u201d Wholly insufficient, I thought.</p><p>But now here I am: No money. No place to stay. It should be my worst nightmare. But I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s funny the things you think you\u2019re scared of until they\u2019re upon you, and then you\u2019re not.</p><p>And so we walk. The streets are quiet. It seems to be just us and street sweepers in their bright-green jumpsuits, their twig-like neon-green brooms looking like they were plucked from a magical forest. There\u2019s the flash of headlights as cars and taxis pass by, splashing through the puddles left by the earlier downpour, which has now softened to a misty drizzle.</p><p>We walk along the quiet canals and then along the park with the lake where we hitched a ride earlier in the day. We walk under the elevated railroad tracks.</p><p>Eventually, we wind up in a small Chinatown. It\u2019s closed up for the night, but the signs are all lit up.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d I say to Willem, pointing to one. \u201cIt\u2019s double happiness.\u201d</p><p>Willem stops and looks at the sign. His face is beautiful, even reflected in the bright neon glow.</p><p>\u201cDouble happiness.\u201d He smiles. Then he takes my hand.</p><p>My heart somersaults. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never got to see any art.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Paris!\u201d</p><p>We wend deeper into Chinatown, cutting up and down the streets until Willem finds what he\u2019s looking for: a series of tall, dilapidated buildings with barred windows. They all look the same except for the building on the far right; it is covered in red scaffolding from which hangs a series of very modern, very distorted portraits. The front door is completely covered in colorful graffiti and flyers.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn art squat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Willem tells me about squats, abandoned buildings that artists or musicians or punks or activists take over. \u201cUsually, they\u2019ll put you up for the night. I haven\u2019t slept here, but I\u2019ve been inside once, and they were pretty nice.\u201d</p><p>But when Willem tries the heavy steel front door, it\u2019s locked and chained from the outside. He steps back to look at the windows, but the whole place, like the surrounding neighborhood, is tucked in for the night.</p><p>Willem looks at me apologetically. \u201cI thought someone would be here tonight.\u201d He sighs. \u201cWe can stay with C\u00e9line.\u201d But even he looks less than thrilled at that prospect.</p><p>I shake my head. I would rather walk all night in the pouring rain. And, anyway, the rain has stopped. A thin sliver of moon is dodging in and out of the clouds. It looks so fundamentally Parisian hanging over the slanting rooftops that it\u2019s hard to believe this is the same moon that will shine in my bedroom window back home tonight. Willem follows my gaze up to the sky. Then his eyes lock on something.</p><p>He walks back toward the building, and I follow him. Along one corner, a piece of scaffolding runs up to a ledge that leads to an open window. A curtain billows in the breeze.</p><p>Willem looks at the window. Then at me. \u201cCan you climb?\u201d</p><p>Yesterday I would\u2019ve said no. Too high. Too dangerous. But today I say, \u201cI can try.\u201d</p><p>I sling my bag over my shoulder and step onto the ladder Willem has made with the loop of his hands. He heaves me halfway up, and I get a foothold in a groove in the plaster and use the scaffolding to get myself to the ledge. I sort of belly-slide across it and grab at the spiral railings by the window, heaving myself through headfirst.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay!\u201d I call. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>I poke my head out the window. Willem is standing just below. He has that private little half smile again. And then as effortlessly as a squirrel, he shimmies up, steps upright onto the ledge, crosses it with his arms out like a tightrope walker, bends his knees, and slips into the window.</p><p>It takes a minute for my eyes to adjust to the darkness, but once they do, I see white everywhere: white walls, white shelves, white desk, white clay sculptures.</p><p>\u201cSomeone left us a key,\u201d Willem says.</p><p>We are both quiet. I like to think it\u2019s a moment of thanksgiving for the providence of accidents.</p><p>Willem pulls out a small flashlight. \u201cShall we explore?\u201d</p><p>I nod. We set off, examining a sculpture that looks like it\u2019s made of marshmallows, a series of black-and-white photos of naked fat girls, a series of oil paintings of naked skinny girls. He shines the flashlight around a giant sculpture, very futuristic, metal and tubes, all twisted and turning, like an artist\u2019s rendition of a space station.</p><p>We pad down the creaking stairs to a room with black walls and enormous photographs of people floating in deep blue water. I stand there and can almost feel the soft water, the way the waves caress when I sometimes go swimming in Mexico at night to escape the crowds.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Willem asks.</p><p>\u201cBetter than the Louvre.\u201d</p><p>We go back upstairs. Willem clicks off the flashlight.</p><p>\u201cYou know? One day one of these might be in the Louvre,\u201d he says. He touches an elliptical white sculpture that seems to glow in the darkness. \u201cYou think Shakespeare ever guessed Guerrilla Will would be doing his plays four hundred years later?\u201d He laughs a little, but there\u2019s something in his voice that sounds almost reverent. \u201cYou never know what will last.\u201d</p><p>He said that earlier, about accidents, about never knowing which one is just a kink in the road and which one is a fork, about never knowing your life is changing until it\u2019s already happened.</p><p>\u201cI think sometimes you do know,\u201d I say, my voice filling with emotion.</p><p>Willem turns to me, fingers the strap on my shoulder bag. For a second, I can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t breathe. He lifts my bag and drops it to the floor. An eddy of dust flies up and tickles my nose. I sneeze.</p><p>\u201cGezondheid,\u201d Willem says.</p><p>\u201cHagelslag,\u201d I say back.</p><p>\u201cYou remember that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember everything from today.\u201d There\u2019s a lump in my throat as I understand just how true this is.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you remember?\u201d He drops his backpack next to my messenger bag. They slump into each other like old war buddies.</p><p>I lean back against the worktable. The day flashes before me: From Willem\u2019s playful voice over my breakfast on the first train to the exhilaration of making my strange admission to him on the next train to the Giant\u2019s amiable kiss in the club to the cooling stickiness of Willem\u2019s saliva on my wrist at the caf\u00e9 to the sound of secrets underneath Paris to the release I experienced when my watch came off to the electricity I felt when Willem\u2019s hand found me to the shattering fear of that girl\u2019s scream to Willem\u2019s brave and immediate reaction to it to our flight through Paris, which felt just like that, like flight, to his eyes: the way they watch me, tease me, test me, and, yet, somehow understand me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s what I see before my eyes when I think of this day.</p><p>It has to do with Paris, but more than that, it has to do with the person who brought me here. And with the person he allowed me to become here. I\u2019m too overcome to explain it all, so instead I say the one word that encapsulates it: \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about this?\u201d He touches the bandage on my neck. I feel a jolt that has nothing to do with the wound.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about that,\u201d I whisper.</p> <p>\u201cI care,\u201d he whispers back.</p><p>What Willem doesn\u2019t know\u2014what he can\u2019t know, because he didn\u2019t know me before today\u2014is that none of that matters. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in danger today,\u201d I tell him in a choked voice. \u201cI escaped danger today.\u201d And I did. Not just getting away from the skinheads, but I feel like the whole day has been an electrical shock, paddles straight to my heart, bringing me out of a lifelong torpor I hadn\u2019t even known I was in. \u201cI escaped,\u201d I repeat.</p><p>\u201cYou escaped.\u201d He comes closer so he towers over me. My back is pressed into the worktable, and my heart starts to pound because there\u2019s no escaping this. I don\u2019t want to escape this.</p><p>As if disconnected from the rest of my body, my hand raises in the air and goes to touch his cheek. But before it arrives, Willem\u2019s hand whips around and grabs my wrist. For one confused second, I think I\u2019ve misread the situation again, am about to be refused.</p><p>Willem holds my wrist for a long moment, looking at that birthmark. Then he lifts it to his mouth. And though his lips are soft and his kiss is gentle, it feels like a knife jamming into the electrical socket. It feels like the moment when I go live.</p> <p>Willem kisses my wrist, then moves upward, along the inside of my arm to the tickly crook of my elbow, to my armpit, to places that never seemed deserving of kisses. My breath grows ragged as his lips graze my shoulder blade now, stopping to drink at the pool of my clavicle before turning their attention to the cords of my neck, to the area around the bandage, then gently to the top of the bandage. Parts of my body I never even realized existed come alive as the circuits click on.</p><p>When he finally kisses my mouth, everything goes oddly quiet, like the moment of silence between lightning and thunder. One Mississippi. Two Mississippi. Three Mississippi. Four Mississippi. Five Mississippi.</p><p>Bang.</p><p>We kiss again. This next kiss is the kind that breaks open the sky. It steals my breath and gives it back. It shows me that every other kiss I\u2019ve had in my life has been wrong.</p><p>I tangle my hands into that hair of his and pull him toward me. Willem cups the back of my neck, runs his fingers along the little outcroppings of my vertebrae. Ping. Ping. Ping, go the electric shocks.</p><p>His hands encircle my waist as he boosts me onto the table, so we are face-to-face, kissing hard now. My cardigan comes off. Then my T-shirt. Then his. His chest is smooth and cut, and I bury my head in it, kissing down the indentation at his centerline. I\u2019m unbuckling his belt, tugging down his jeans with hunger I don\u2019t recognize.</p> <p>My legs loop around his waist. His hands are all over me, migrating down to the crease of my hip where they\u2019d rested during our nap. I make a sound that doesn\u2019t seem like it could come from me.</p><p>A condom materializes. My underwear is shimmied down over my sandaled feet and my skirt is bunched into a petticoat around my waist. Willem\u2019s boxers fall away. Then he lifts me off the table. And then I realize that I was wrong before. Only now is my surrender complete.</p><p>After, we fall to the floor, Willem on his back, me resting next to him. His fingers graze my birthmark, which feels like it is flashing heat, and mine tickle his wrist, the hairs so soft against the heavy links of my watch.</p><p>\u201cSo this is how you\u2019d take care of me?\u201d he jokes, pointing to a red mark on his neck where I think I bit him.</p><p>Like with everything, he\u2019s turned my promise into something funny, something to tease me with. But I don\u2019t feel like laughing, not now, not about this, not after that.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s not how.\u201d Part of me wants to disavow the whole thing. But I won\u2019t. Because he asked me if I\u2019d take care of him, and even if it was a joke, I made a promise that I would, and that wasn\u2019t a joke. When I said I\u2019d be his mountain girl, I knew I wasn\u2019t going to see him again. That wasn\u2019t the point. I wanted him to know that when felt alone out there in the world . . . I was there too.</p><p>But that was yesterday. With a clench of my chest that makes me truly understand why it\u2019s called heartbreak, I wonder if it\u2019s not him being alone that I\u2019m worried about.</p><p>Willem fingers the fine film of white clay dust that covers my body. \u201cYou\u2019re like a ghost,\u201d he says. \u201cSoon you disappear.\u201d His voice is light, but when I try to catch his eye, he won\u2019t meet my gaze.</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d There\u2019s a lump in my throat. If we keep talking about this, it\u2019ll become a sob.</p><p>Willem wipes off a bit of the dust and my darker, tour-tanned skin reemerges. But other things, I now realize, won\u2019t come off so readily. I take Willem\u2019s chin in my hands and turn him to face me. In the wispy glow of the streetlamp, his planes and angles are both shadowed and illuminated. And then he looks at me, really looks at me, and the expression on his face is sad and wistful and tender and yearning, and it tells me everything I need to know.</p><p>My hand shakes as I raise it to my mouth. I lick my thumb and rub it against my wrist, against my birthmark. Then I rub again. I look up, look him right in his eyes, which are as dark as this night I don\u2019t want to end.</p><p>Willem\u2019s face falters for a moment, then he grows solemn, the way he did after we were chased. Then he reaches over and rubs my birthmark. It\u2019s not coming off, is what he is telling me.</p><p>\u201cBut you leave tomorrow,\u201d he says.</p><p>I can hear the drumbeat of my heart echo in my temples. \u201cI don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>For a second, he looks confused.</p><p>\u201cI can stay for another day,\u201d I explain.</p><p>Another day. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking. Just one more day. I can\u2019t think beyond that. Beyond that things get complicated. Flights get delayed. Parents go ballistic. But one more day. One more day I can swing with minimal hassle, without upsetting anyone but Melanie. Who will understand. Eventually.</p><p>Part of me knows one more day won\u2019t do anything except postpone the heartbreak. But another part of me believes differently. We are born in one day. We die in one day. We can change in one day. And we can fall in love in one day. Anything can happen in just one day.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I ask Willem. \u201cOne more day?\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t answer. Instead, he flips me under him. I sink into the cement floor, submitting to the weight of him. Until something sharp jabs into my rib cage.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>Willem reaches under me and pulls out a small metal chisel.</p><p>\u201cWe should find somewhere else to stay,\u201d I say. \u201cNot with C\u00e9line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Willem quiets me with his lips.</p><p>Later, after we have taken our time, exploring every hidden crease of each other\u2019s bodies, after we have kissed and licked and whispered and laughed until our limbs are heavy and the sky outside has started to purple with predawn light, Willem pulls a tarp over us.</p><p>\u201cGoeienacht, Lulu,\u201d he says, his eyes fluttering with exhaustion.</p><p>I trace the creases of his face with my fingers. \u201cGoeienacht, Willem,\u201d I reply. I lean into his ear, push the messy bramble of his hair aside and whisper, \u201cAllyson. My name is Allyson.\u201d But by then, he is already asleep. I rest my head in the crook between his arm and shoulder, tracing the letters of my true name onto his forearm, where I imagine their outlines will remain until morning.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>After a ten-day heat wave, I\u2019m used to waking up sweaty, but I wake up to a cool breeze gusting through an open window. I reach for a blanket, but instead of getting something warm and feathery, I get something hard and crinkly. A tarp. And in that hazy space between wake and sleep, it all comes back to me. Where I am. Who I\u2019m with. The happiness warms me from the inside.</p><p>I reach for Willem, but he\u2019s not there. I open my eyes, squinting against the gray light, bouncing off the bright white of the studio walls.</p><p>Instinctively, I check my watch, but my wrist is bare. I pad over to the window, pulling my skirt around my naked chest. The streets are still quiet, the stores and caf\u00e9s still shut. It\u2019s still early.</p><p>I want to call to him, but there\u2019s a church-like hush, and to disrupt it feels wrong. He must be downstairs, maybe in the bathroom. I could sort of use it myself. I pull on my clothes and tiptoe down the stairs. But Willem isn\u2019t in the bathroom, either. I quickly pee and throw water on my face and try to drink away the beginnings of my hangover.</p><p>He must be exploring the studios by daylight. Or maybe he went back up the staircase. Calm down, I tell myself. He\u2019s probably back upstairs right now.</p><p>\u201cWillem?\u201d I call.</p><p>There\u2019s no answer.</p><p>I run back upstairs to the studio we slept in. It\u2019s messy. On the floor is my bag, its contents spilling out. But his bag, his stuff, is all gone.</p><p>My hearts starts to pound. I run over to my bag and open it up, checking for my wallet and passport, my minimal cash. Immediately I feel stupid. He paid for me to come over here. He isn\u2019t going to rip me off. I remind myself of the tizzy I got myself into yesterday on the train.</p><p>I run up and down the stairs, calling his name now. But it just echoes back to me\u2014Willem, Willem!\u2014like the walls are laughing at me.</p><p>Panic is coming. I try to push it away with logic. He went out to get us something to eat. To find us somewhere to sleep.</p><p>I go stand next to the window and wait.</p><p>Paris begins to wake. Store grates go up, sidewalks are swept. Car horns start honking, bicycles chime, the sound of footfalls on the rainy pavement multiply.</p><p>If stores are open, it must be nine o\u2019clock? Ten? Soon the artists will arrive, and what will they do when they find me squatting in their squat like Goldilocks?</p><p>I decide to wait outside. I put on my shoes and sling my bag over my shoulder and head to the open window. But in the cold light of day, without wine emboldening me or Willem helping me, the distance between the second floor and the ground seems like an awfully long way to fall.</p><p>You got up, you can get back down, I chastise myself. But when I hoist myself onto the ledge and reach for the scaffolding, my hand slips and I feel dizzy. I imagine my parents getting the news of me falling to my death from a Paris building. I collapse back into the studio, hyperventilating into the cave of my hands.</p><p>Where is he? Where the hell is he? My mind pinballs through rationales for his delay. He went to get more money. He went to fetch my suitcase. What if he fell going out the window? I jump up, full of twisted optimism that I will find him sprawled underneath the drain pipe, hurt but okay, and then I can make good on my promise to take care of him. But there\u2019s nothing under the window except a puddle of dirty water.</p><p>I sink back down onto the studio floor, breathless with fear, which is now on an entirely different Richter scale than my little scare on the train.</p><p>More time goes by. I hug my knees, shivering in the damp morning. I creep downstairs. I try the front door, but it\u2019s locked, from the outside. I have the sense that I\u2019m going to be trapped here forever, that I\u2019ll grow old and wither and die locked in this squat.</p><p>How late can artists sleep? What time is it? But I don\u2019t need a clock to tell me Willem has been gone too long. With each passing minute, the explanations I keep concocting ring increasingly hollow.</p><p>Finally, I hear the clank of the chain and keys jangle in the locks, but when the door swings open, it\u2019s a woman with two long braids carrying a bunch of rolled up canvases. She looks at me and starts talking to me in French, but I just spring past her.</p><p>Out on the street, I look around for Willem, but he\u2019s not here. It seems like he would never be here, on this ugly stretch of cheap Chinese restaurants and auto garages and apartment blocks, all gray in the gray rain. Why did I ever think this place was beautiful? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I run into the street. The cars honk at me, their horns strange and foreign sounding, as if even they speak another language. I spin around, having absolutely no idea where I am, no idea where to go, but desperately wanting to be home. Home in my bed. Safe.</p><p>The tears make it hard to see, but somehow I stumble across the street, down the sidewalk, ricocheting from block to block. This time no one is chasing me. But this time I am scared.</p><p>I run for several blocks, up a bunch of stairs and onto a square of sorts, with a rack of those gray-white bicycles, a real estate agency, a pharmacy, and a caf\u00e9, in front of which is a phone booth. Melanie! I can call Melanie. I take some deep breaths, swallow my sobs, and follow the instructions to get the international operator. But the call goes straight to voice mail. Of course it does. She left the phone off to avoid calls from my mother.</p><p>An operator comes on the line to tell me I can\u2019t leave a message because the call is collect. I start to cry. The operator asks me if she should call the police for me. I hiccup out a no, and she asks if perhaps there is someone else I might call. And that\u2019s when I remember Ms. Foley\u2019s business card.</p> <p>She picks up with a brisk \u201cPat Foley.\u201d The operator has to ask her if she\u2019ll accept the collect call three times because I start crying harder the minute she answers, so she can\u2019t hear the request.</p><p>\u201cAllyson. Allyson. What\u2019s the matter? Are you hurt?\u201d she asks over the line.</p><p>I\u2019m too scared, too numb to be hurt. That will come later.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say in the tiniest of voices. \u201cI need help.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Foley manages to pull the basics out of me. That I went to Paris with a boy I met on the train. That I\u2019m stuck here, lost, with no money, no clue where I am.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I beg her. \u201cI just want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s work on getting you back to England, shall we?\u201d she says calmly. \u201cDo you have a ticket?\u201d</p><p>Willem bought me a round trip, I think. I rifle through my bag and pull out my passport. The ticket is still folded neatly inside. \u201cI think so,\u201d I tell Ms. Foley in a quivery voice.</p><p>\u201cWhen is the return booked for?\u201d</p><p>I look at it. The numbers and dates all swim together. \u201cI can\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTop left corner. It\u2019ll be in military time. The twenty-four-hour clock.\u201d</p> <p>And there I see it. \u201cThirteen-thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirteen-thirty,\u201d Ms. Foley says in that comfortingly efficient voice of hers. \u201cExcellent. That\u2019s one-thirty. It\u2019s just past noon now in Paris, so you have time to catch that train. Can you get yourself to the train station? Or to a Metro?\u201d</p><p>I have no idea how. And no money. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about a taxi? Take a taxi to the Gare du Nord?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. I don\u2019t have any euros to pay for a taxi. I tell Ms. Foley that. I can hear the disapproval in her silence. As if nothing I\u2019ve told her before has lowered me in her esteem, but coming to Paris without sufficient funds? She sighs. \u201cI can order you a taxi from here and have it prepaid to bring you to the train station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where I am,\u201d I bellow. I paid absolutely no attention to where Willem took me yesterday. I surrendered.</p> <p>\u201cAllyson!\u201d Her voice is a slap across the face, and it has just the intended effect. It stops my caterwauling. \u201cCalm down. Now put the phone down for a moment and go write down the nearest intersection.\u201d</p><p>I reach into my bag for my pen, but it\u2019s not there. I put the phone down and memorize the street names. \u201cI\u2019m at Avenue Simon Bolivar and Rue de l\u2019Equerre.\u201d I\u2019m butchering the pronunciation. \u201cIn front of a pharmacy.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Foley repeats back the information, then tells me not to move, that a car will be there within a half hour and that I\u2019m to call her back if one doesn\u2019t arrive. That if she doesn\u2019t hear from me, she will assume that I will be on the one-thirty train to St. Pancras, and she will meet me in London right at edge of the platform at two forty-five. I\u2019m not to leave the train station without her.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, a black Mercedes cruises up to the corner. The driver holds a sign, and when I see my name\u2014Allyson Healey\u2014I feel both relieved and bereft. Lulu, wherever she came from, is truly gone now.</p><p>I slide into the backseat, and we take off for what turns out to be all of a ten-minute drive to the train station. Ms. Foley has arranged for the driver to take me inside, to show me right where to board. I\u2019m in a daze as we make our way through the station, and it\u2019s only when I am slumped into my seat and I see people wheeling bags through the aisles that I realize that I\u2019ve left my suitcase at the club. All my clothes and all the souvenirs from the trip are in there. And I don\u2019t even care. I have lost something far more valuable in Paris.</p><p>I keep it together until the train goes into the Tunnel. And then maybe it\u2019s the safety of the darkness or the memory of yesterday\u2019s underwater journey that sets everything loose, but once we leave Calais and the windows darken, I again start to quietly sob, my tears salty and endless as the sea I\u2019m traveling through.</p><p>At St. Pancras, Ms. Foley escorts me to a caf\u00e9, stations me at a corner table, and buys me tea that grows cold in its cup. I tell her everything now: The underground Shakespeare play in Stratford-upon-Avon. Meeting Willem on the train. The trip to Paris. The perfect day. His mysterious disappearance this morning that I still do not understand. My panicked flight.</p><p>I expect her to be stern\u2014disapproving, for deceiving her, for being such a not-good girl\u2014but instead she is sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cOh, Allyson,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know what could\u2019ve happened to him. I waited and waited for a few hours at least, and I got so scared. I panicked. I don\u2019t know, maybe I should\u2019ve waited longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve waited until next Christmas, and I scarcely imagine it would have done a spot of good,\u201d Ms. Foley says.</p><p>I look at her. I can feel my eyes beseeching.</p><p>\u201cHe was an actor, Allyson. An actor. They are the worst of the lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think the whole thing was an act? Was fake?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cYesterday wasn\u2019t fake.\u201d My voice is emphatic, though I\u2019m no longer sure who I\u2019m trying to convince.</p><p>\u201cI daresay it was real in the moment,\u201d she says, measuring her words. \u201cBut men are different from women. Their emotions are capricious. And actors turn it on and turn it right back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an act,\u201d I repeat, but my argument is losing steam.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep with him?\u201d</p><p>For a second, I can still feel him on me. I push the thought away, look at Ms. Foley, nod.</p><p>\u201cThen he got what he came for.\u201d Her words are matter-of-fact, but not unkind. \u201cI imagine he never planned on it being more than a one-day fling. That was exactly what he proposed, after all.\u201d</p><p>It was. Until it wasn\u2019t. Last night, we declared our feelings for each other. I am about to tell Ms. Foley this. But then I stop cold: Did we declare anything? Or did I just lick some spit on myself?</p><p>I think about Willem. Really think about him. What do I actually know about him? Only a handful of facts\u2014how old he is, how tall he is, what he weighs, his nationality, except I don\u2019t even know that because he said his mother wasn\u2019t Dutch. He\u2019s a traveler. A drifter, really. Accidents are the defining force in his life.</p><p>I don\u2019t know his birthday. Or his favorite color, or favorite book, or favorite type of music. Or if he had a pet growing up. I don\u2019t know if he ever broke a bone. Or how he got the scar on his foot or why he hasn\u2019t been home in so long. I don\u2019t even know his last name! And that\u2019s still more than he has on me. He doesn\u2019t even know my first name!</p><p>In this ugly little caf\u00e9, without the romantic gleam of Paris turning everything rose-colored pretty, I begin to see things as they truly are: Willem invited me to Paris for one day. He never promised me anything more. Last night, he\u2019d even tried to send me home. He knew Lulu wasn\u2019t my real name, and he made absolutely no attempt to ever find out who I really was. When I\u2019d mentioned texting or emailing him the picture of the two of us, he\u2019d cleverly refused to give out his contact details.</p><p>And it wasn\u2019t like he\u2019d lied. He said he\u2019d fallen in love many times, but had never been in love. He\u2019d offered it up about himself. I think of the girls on the train, C\u00e9line, the models, the girl at the caf\u00e9. And that was just in a single day together. How many of us were out there? And rather than accept my lot and enjoy my one day and move on, I\u2019d dug in my heels. I\u2019d told him I was in love with him. That I wanted to take care of him. I\u2019d begged for another day, assumed he wanted it too. But he never answered me. He never actually said yes.</p><p>Oh, my God! It all makes sense now. How could I have been so na\u00efve? Fall in love? In a day? Everything from yesterday, it was all fake. All an illusion. As reality crystallizes into place, the shame and humiliation make me so sick, I feel dizzy. I cradle my head in my hands.</p><p>Ms. Foley reaches out to pat my head. \u201cThere, there, dear. Let it out. Predictable, yes, but still brutal. He could have at least seen you off at the train station, waved you away and then never called again. A bit more civilized.\u201d She squeezes my hand. \u201cThis too shall pass.\u201d She pauses, leans in closer. \u201cWhat happened to your neck, dear?\u201d</p><p>My hand flies up to my neck. The bandage has come off, and the scabby cut is starting to itch. \u201cNothing,\u201d I say. \u201cIt was an . . . \u201d I\u2019m about to say accident, but I stop myself. \u201cA tree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where\u2019s your lovely watch?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I look down at my wrist. I see my birthmark, ugly, naked, blaring. I yank down my sweater sleeve to cover it. \u201cHe has it.\u201d</p><p>She clucks her tongue. \u201cThey\u2019ll do that, sometimes. Take things as a sort of trophy. Like serial killers.\u201d She takes a final slurp of her tea. \u201cNow, shall we take you to Melanie?\u201d</p><p>I hand Ms. Foley the scrap of paper with Veronica\u2019s address, and she pulls out a London A\u2013Z book to chart our way. I fall asleep on the Tube, my tears wrung out, the blankness of exhaustion the only comfort I have now. Ms. Foley shakes me awake at Veronica\u2019s stop and leads me to the redbricked Victorian house where her flat is.</p><p>Melanie comes bounding to the door, already dressed up for tonight\u2019s trip to the theater. Her face is lit up with anticipation, waiting to hear a really good story. But then she sees Ms. Foley, and her expression skids. Without knowing anything, she knows everything: She bid Lulu farewell at the train station yesterday, and it\u2019s Allyson being returned to her like damaged goods. She gives the slightest of nods, as if none of this surprises her. Then she kicks off her heels and opens her arms to me, and when I step into them, the humiliation and heartbreak bring me to my knees. Melanie sinks to the ground alongside me, her arms hugging me tight. Behind me, I hear Ms. Foley\u2019s retreating footsteps. I let her leave without saying a word. I don\u2019t thank her. And I already know that I never will, and that is wrong considering the great kindness she\u2019s done me. But if I am to survive, I can never, ever visit this day again.</p><p>PART TWO</p><p>One Year</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>SEPTEMBER</p><p>College</p><p>Allyson. Allyson. Are you there?\u201d</p><p>I pull the pillow over my head and scrunch my eyes shut, faking sleep.</p><p>The key turns in the lock as my roommate Kali pushes open the door. \u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t lock the door when you are here. And I know you\u2019re not asleep. You\u2019re just playing dead. Like Buster.\u201d</p><p>Buster is Kali\u2019s dog. A Lhasa apso. She has pictures of him among the dozens tacked up on the wall. She told me all about Buster last July when we had our initial howdy-roommate phone call. Back then, I thought Buster sounded cute, and I found it quirky that Kali was named for her home state, and the way she talked\u2014as if she were punching her words somehow\u2014seemed sweet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkaay, Allyson. Fine. Don\u2019t answer, but look, can you call your parents back? Your mother called my cell looking for you.\u201d</p><p>From under the pillows, I open my eyes. I\u2019d wondered how long I could leave my phone uncharged before something would happen. Already there\u2019s been a mysterious UPS delivery. I was half expecting a carrier pigeon to arrive. But calling my roommates?</p><p>I hide under the pillow as Kali changes into going-out clothes, applying makeup and spritzing herself with that vanilla-scented perfume that gets into everything. After she leaves, I take the pillow off my head and swing my legs over the side of the bed. I push aside my chemistry textbook, the highlighter sitting in the crease, uncapped, ever hopeful it\u2019ll get used before it dries up from neglect. I locate my dead phone in my sock drawer and kick through the dirty laundry piled in my closet for the charger. When it charges back to life, the voice mail box tells me I have twenty-two new messages. I scroll through the missed calls. Eighteen are from my parents. Two from my grandmother. One from Melanie, and one from the registrar.</p><p>\u201cHi, Allyson, it\u2019s your mother. Just calling to check in to see how everything is going. Give me a call.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi, Allyson. It\u2019s Mom. I got the new Boden catalog, and there are some cute skirts. And some warm corduroy jeans. I\u2019ll just order some and bring them up for Parents\u2019 Weekend. Call me back!\u201d</p><p>Then there\u2019s one from my dad. \u201cYour mother wants to know where we should make reservations for Parents\u2019 Weekend: Italian or French or maybe Japanese. I told her you\u2019d be grateful for anything. I can\u2019t imagine dorm food has improved that much in twenty-five years.\u201d</p><p>Then we\u2019re back to Mom: \u201cAllyson, is your phone broken? Please tell me you did not lose that too. Can you please touch base? I\u2019m trying to schedule Parents\u2019 Weekend. I thought I might to come to classes with you. . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Ally, it\u2019s Grandma. I\u2019m on Facebook now. I\u2019m not sure how it works, so make me your friend. Or you could call me. But I want to do it how you kids do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllyson, it\u2019s Dad. Call your mother. Also, we are trying to get reservations at Prezzo. . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAllyson, are you ill? Because I can really think of no other explanation for the radio silence. . . .\u201d</p><p>The messages go downhill from there, Mom acting like three months, not three days, have gone by since our last phone call. I wind up deleting the last batch without even listening, stopping only for Melanie\u2019s rambling account about school and hot New York City guys and the superiority of the pizza there.</p><p>I look at the time on my phone. It\u2019s six o\u2019clock. If I call home, maybe Mom will be out and I\u2019ll get the machine. I\u2019m not quite sure what she does with her days now. When I was seven, she wound up leaving her job, even though she didn\u2019t take that maternity leave after all. The plan had been to go back to work once I went to college, but it hasn\u2019t quite got off the ground yet.</p><p>She picks up on the second ring. \u201cAllyson, where have you been?\u201d Mom\u2019s voice is officious, a little impatient.</p><p>\u201cI ran off to join a cult.\u201d There\u2019s a brief pause, as if she\u2019s actually considering the possibility of this. \u201cI\u2019m at college, Mom. I\u2019m busy. Trying to adjust to the workload.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think this is bad, wait until medical school. Wait until your residency! I hardly saw your father.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen you should be used to it.\u201d</p><p>Mom pauses. This snarkiness of mine is new. Dad says ever since I came back from Europe, I have come down with a case of delayed teenageritis. I never acted like this before, but now I apparently have a bad attitude and a bad haircut and an irresponsibility streak, as evidenced by the fact that I lost not just my suitcase and all its contents, but my graduation watch too, even though, according to the story Melanie and I told them, the suitcase and the watch inside it were stolen off the train. Which theoretically should make me blameless. But it doesn\u2019t. Perhaps because I\u2019m not.</p><p>Mom changes the subject. \u201cDid you get the package? It\u2019s one thing if you ignore me, but your grandmother would appreciate a note.\u201d</p><p>I kick through the rumpled sour clothes for the UPS box. Wrapped in bubble wrap is an antique Betty Boop alarm clock and a box of black-and-white cookies from Shriner\u2019s, a bakery in our town. The sticky note on the cookies says These are from Grandma.</p><p>\u201cI thought the clock would go perfect in your collection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I look at the still-packed boxes in my closet, where my alarm clock collection, and all my nonessential stuff from home, still remains.</p><p>\u201cAnd I ordered you a bunch of new clothes. Shall I send them or just bring them up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust bring them, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking of Parents\u2019 Weekend, we\u2019re firming up plans. Saturday night we are trying to get dinner reservations at Prezzo. Sunday is the brunch, and after that, before we fly home, your father has an alumni thing, so I thought I\u2019d splurge on spa treatments for us. Oh, and Saturday morning, before the luncheon, I\u2019m having coffee with Kali\u2019s mother, Lynn. We\u2019ve been emailing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you emailing my roommate\u2019s mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Mom\u2019s voice is snippy, as if there is no reason for me to be asking about this, as if there is no reason for her not to be present in every single part of my life.</p><p>\u201cWell, can you not call Kali\u2019s cell? It\u2019s a little weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little weird to have your daughter go incommunicado for a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree days, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were counting too.\u201d She pauses, scoring herself the point. \u201cAnd if you would let me install a house phone, we wouldn\u2019t have this issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has landlines anymore. We all have cells. Our own numbers. Please don\u2019t call me on hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen return my calls, Allyson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I just lost my charger,\u201d I lie.</p><p>Her aggrieved sigh on the other end of the line makes me realize I\u2019ve picked the wrong lie. \u201cMust we tie your belongings to you with a rope these days?\u201d she asks.</p><p>\u201cI just loaned it to my roommate, and it got put away with her stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Kali?\u201d</p><p>Kali and I have barely shared a bar of soap. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to meeting her and her family. They seem lovely. They invited us to La Jolla.\u201d</p><p>I almost ask my mother if she really wants to get chummy with people who named their daughter Kali for California. Mom has a thing about names; she hates nicknames. When I was growing up, she was kind of fascist about it, always trying to prevent anyone from shortening my name to Ally or Al. Grandma ignored her, but everyone else, even teachers at school, toed the line. I never got why, if it bothered her so much, she didn\u2019t just name me something that couldn\u2019t be truncated, even if Allyson is a family name. But I don\u2019t say anything about Kali because if I get bitchy, I\u2019ll blow my cover as Happy College Student. And my mother especially, whose parents couldn\u2019t afford to send her to the college of her choice and who had to work her way through college and later support Dad while he was in medical school, is very intent that I be a Happy College Student.</p><p>\u201cI should go,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019m going out with my roommates tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how fun! Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo a party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA keg party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just saw a great one with Kate Winslet. You should see that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me tomorrow. And leave your phone on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProfessors tend to frown on calls in classes.\u201d The snark comes out again.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow\u2019s Saturday. And I know your schedule, Allyson. All your classes are in the mornings.\u201d</p><p>She would know my schedule. She basically created it. All those morning classes because she said they\u2019d be less attended and I\u2019d get more attention and then I\u2019d have the whole rest of the day for studying. Or, as it turns out, for sleeping.</p><p>After we hang up, I shove the alarm clock into a box in my closet and take the cookies and bring them into the lounge where the rest of my roommates have started in on a six-pack. They\u2019re all dressed up and ready to go out.</p><p>When school started, the rest of them were so excited. They really were Happy College Students. Jenn made organic brownies, and Kendra drew up a little sign on our door with all our names and a moniker, the Fab Four, atop it. Kali, for her part, gave us coupons to a tanning salon to ward off the inevitable seasonal affective disorder.</p><p>Now, a month in, the three of them are a solid unit. And I\u2019m like a goiter. I want to tell Kendra that it\u2019s okay if she takes down the little sign or replaces it with one that says something like Terrific Trio* and Allyson.</p><p>I shuffle into the lounge. \u201cHere,\u201d I say, handing over the cookies to Kali, even though I know she watches her carbs and even though black-and-whites are my favorites. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about my mom.\u201d</p><p>Kendra and Jenn cluck sympathetically, but Kali narrows her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a bitch or anything, but it\u2019s bad enough having to fend off my own parents, okaay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s having Empty Nest or something.\u201d That\u2019s what Dad keeps telling me. \u201cShe won\u2019t do it again,\u201d I add with more confidence than I possess.</p><p>\u201cMy mom turned my bedroom into a craft room two days after I left,\u201d Jenn says. \u201cAt least you\u2019re missed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of cookies are they?\u201d Kendra asks.</p><p>\u201cBlack-and-whites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like us,\u201d Kendra jokes. She\u2019s black, or African American; I\u2019m never sure which is right, and she uses both.</p><p>\u201cThe racial harmony of cookies,\u201d I say.</p><p>Jenn and Kendra laugh. \u201cYou should come out with us tonight,\u201d Jenn says.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to a party over at Henderson and then there\u2019s this bar over on Central that apparently has a very liberal carding policy,\u201d Kendra says, twisting her just-straightened black hair up into a bun, then thinking twice about it and pulling it down. \u201cLots of fine male specimen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd female specimen, if that\u2019s your thing,\u201d Jenn adds.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my thing. I mean, none of it is my thing.\u201d</p><p>Kali gives me a bitchy smirk. \u201cThink you enrolled in the wrong school. I believe there\u2019s a convent in Boston.\u201d</p><p>Something twists in my stomach. \u201cThey don\u2019t take Jews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off, you two,\u201d Kendra says, ever the diplomat. She turns to me. \u201cWhy not come out for a few hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChemistry. Physics.\u201d The room goes silent. They\u2019re all liberal arts or business majors, so invoking Science shuts them up.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d better get back to my room. I have a date with the Third Law of Thermodynamics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds hot,\u201d Jenn says.</p><p>I smile to show I actually get the joke, then shuffle back to my room, where I diligently pick up Foundations of Chemistry, but by the time the Terrific Trio are heading out the door, my eyes have sandbags in them. I fall asleep under a mountain of unread science. And thus begins another weekend in the life of the Happy College Student.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>OCTOBER</p><p>College</p><p>I put off thinking about Parents\u2019 Weekend as long as I can and then the Thursday before they\u2019re due to arrive, I look around my dorm and see it not as I see it\u2014walls, a bed, a desk, a dresser\u2014but as my parents will see it. This is not the dorm of a Happy College Student. There\u2019s dirty laundry spilling out of every drawer, and my papers are everywhere. My mother despises clutter. I ditch my classes and spend the day cleaning. I haul all the dirty laundry down to the washing machines and sit with it as it turns and gyrates. I wipe down the dusty surfaces. In the closet, I hide away all my current schoolwork\u2014the Mandarin worksheets, piling up like unread newspapers, the Scantron chemistry and physics exams with their ominously low scores scrawled in red; the lab reports with comments like \u201cNeed to be more thorough\u201d and \u201cCheck your calculations!\u201d and the dreaded \u201cSee me.\u201d In their place, I set out a bunch of decoy notes and graphs from early in the term, before I started obviously bombing. I unwrap the duvet cover we bought at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond last summer and put it over the plain quilt I\u2019ve been sleeping under. I grab some of the photos from the boxes and scatter them around the room. I even drop by the U bookstore and buy one of the stupid banners with the school name on it and tack it above my bed. Voil\u00e0. School Spirit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But somehow I forget the clocks. And this gives me away.</p><p>When Mom comes into the dorm, after cooing over our tiny dump of a lounge, she oohs over Kali\u2019s pictures of Buster and then looks at my relatively bare walls and gasps. By her look of horror, you\u2019d think I\u2019d decorated with crime-scene photos. \u201cWhere\u2019s your collection?\u201d</p><p>I point to the boxes in the closet, unopened.</p><p>\u201cWhy are they there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re too noisy,\u201d I quickly lie. \u201cI don\u2019t want to bother Kali with them.\u201d Never mind the fact that Kali blasts her radio at seven in the morning.</p><p>\u201cYou could put them out and not wind them,\u201d she says. \u201cThose clocks are you.\u201d</p><p>Are they? I don\u2019t remember when I started collecting them. Mom liked to go to flea markets on weekends and then one day, I was a clock collector. I got really into it for a while, but I don\u2019t remember the moment I saw an old alarm clock and thought, I want to collect these.</p><p>\u201cYour half looks terribly barren next to Kali\u2019s,\u201d Mom says.</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve seen my dorm,\u201d Dad says, lost in his haze of nostalgia. \u201cMy roommate put tinfoil on the windows. It looked like a spaceship. He called it the \u2018Future Dorm.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was going for Minimalist Dorm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has a certain penitentiary charm,\u201d Dad says.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a before/after on one of those home d\u00e9cor shows.\u201d Mom points to Kali\u2019s half of the room, over which every inch of wall space is covered either with posters, art prints, or photos. \u201cYou\u2019re the before,\u201d she says. As if I didn\u2019t already get that.</p><p>We head off to one of the special workshops, something insanely dull on the changing face of technology in the classroom. Mom actually takes notes. Dad points out every little thing that he remembers and every little thing that is new. This is what he did when we toured the school last year; both he and Mom were so excited about the prospect of me going here. Creating a legacy. Somehow, back then, I was excited too.</p><p>After the workshop, Dad meets up with other legacy parents, and Mom has coffee with Kali\u2019s mom, Lynn. They seem to get along famously. Either Kali hasn\u2019t told her mom what a dud I am, or if she has, her mom has the good grace to shut up about it.</p><p>Before the President\u2019s Luncheon, all four members of the Fab Four and their respective families meet back at the suite and the parents all introduce themselves and cluck over the tininess of our rooms and admire what we\u2019ve done with our tiny lounge and take pictures of THE FAB FOUR WELCOMES THE FAB EIGHT sign that the rest of the group made. Then we all walk out onto the quad together and tour the campus, going the long way around to point out some of the older, statelier buildings, reddening ivy creeping up old bricks. And everyone looks nice together in flannel skirts and tall black boots and cashmere sweaters and shearling jackets as we swish through the autumnal leaves. We really do look like the Happy College Students in the catalogs.</p> <p>The luncheon is fine and boring, rubber chicken and rubber speeches in a big, cold echoey hall. It\u2019s only after the luncheon that the myth of the Fab Four starts to unravel. Ever so subtly, Kendra\u2019s and Jenn\u2019s and Kali\u2019s families all peel off together. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re talking about Christmas and Thanksgiving holidays and spring breaks and potlucks and things like that. My mom gives them a look but doesn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>She and Dad go back to the hotel to get ready for dinner. Mom tells me the place is fancy and suggests I wear my black and red wrap dress. And that I wash my hair, which is looking greasy.</p><p>When they come back to pick me up, there\u2019s an awkward moment as my family meets up with the rest of the Fab Four and their Fab Families, who are all going together to a big group dinner at some famous seafood place in downtown Boston. There\u2019s a sort of standoff as my parents face the other parents. The rest of my roommates, their faces pinking, take a huge interest in the industrial gray carpeting. Finally, Jenn\u2019s dad steps in and offers a belated invitation for us to join the rest of them for dinner. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can squeeze three more in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Mom says in her haughtiest voice. \u201cWe have reservations at Prezzo in Back Bay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow! How\u2019d you manage that?\u201d Lynn asks. \u201cWe tried and couldn\u2019t get in until next month.\u201d Prezzo, according to Mom, is the hottest restaurant in town.</p><p>Mom smiles mysteriously. She won\u2019t tell, though Dad told me one of his golf buddies had a friend on the faculty at a hospital in Boston and he pulled some strings to get us in. Mom had been so pleased about it, but I can see now the victory is sullied.</p><p>\u201cEnjoy your chowdah,\u201d she says. Only Dad and I catch how condescending she\u2019s being.</p><p>Dinner is painful. Even sitting at this chichi place with all the best Bostonians, I can tell Mom and, by extension, Dad feel like rejects. And they\u2019re not. It\u2019s my rejection they\u2019re feeling.</p> <p>They ask me about my classes, and I dutifully tell them about chemistry, physics, biology, and Mandarin, neglecting to tell them how hard it is stay awake in class, no matter how early I go to bed, or how badly I\u2019m doing in subjects I aced in high school. Talking about, or not talking about, all this makes me so tired I want to put my head down into my thirteen-dollar salad.</p><p>When the entrees come, Mom orders a glass of Chardonnay, Dad a Shiraz. I try not to look at the way the candlelight dances against the colors of the wine. Even that hurts. I look down at my plate of ravioli. It smells good, but I have no desire to eat it.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming down with something?\u201d Mom asks.</p><p>And for just the tiniest of seconds, I wonder what would happen if I told them the truth. That school is nothing like I imagined it would be. That I\u2019m not the girl in the catalog at all. I\u2019m not a Happy College Student. I don\u2019t know who I am. Or maybe I do know who I am and I just don\u2019t want to be her anymore.</p><p>But this is not an option. Mom would just be aggrieved, disappointed, as if my unhappiness were some personal insult to her parenting. And then she\u2019d guilt me out about how I\u2019m so lucky. This is college! The college experience she didn\u2019t get to have. Which was one of the reasons she spent all of high school like an army general, plotting my extracurriculars, getting me tutors for weak subjects, signing me up for SAT prep.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just tired,\u201d I say. This, at least, isn\u2019t a lie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably spending too much time in the library,\u201d Dad interjects. \u201cAre you getting enough sunlight? That can really affect your circadian rhythms.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. This too is true.</p><p>\u201cHave you been running? There are some nice tracks around here. And it\u2019s not too far to the river.\u201d</p><p>I think the last time I went running was with Dad, a couple days before I left for the tour.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go out tomorrow morning, before the brunch. Burn off dinner. Get some air in those lungs.\u201d</p><p>Just the thought of it makes me exhausted, but this isn\u2019t an invitation so much as an expectation, and the plans are being made even before I\u2019ve agreed to them.</p><p>The following morning, the rest of the girls are sitting in the lounge drinking coffee, happily chattering about their dinner, which included some incident with a cute waiter and a lobster mallet that\u2019s already being mythologized into a tale called \u201cThe Hammer and the Hottie.\u201d They double-take when they see me in tracksuit bottoms and a fleece sweatshirt, looking around for my running shoes. Our dorm has a state-of-the-art gym that Kendra and Kali are addicted to and Jenn gets dragged along to, but I have yet to set foot in.</p><p>I just expect my dad, but Mom is there too, all perky in her black wool pants, a cashmere cape. \u201cI thought we were meeting at brunch,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh, I just wanted to spend some time in your dorm. It\u2019ll help me to picture where you are when I\u2019m not with you.\u201d She turns to Kali. \u201cIf that\u2019s okay with you.\u201d Her voice is so polite, Kali might never catch the bitchiness in it.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s sweet,\u201d Kali says.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, Allyson?\u201d Dad asks me.</p><p>\u201cAlmost. I can\u2019t find my running shoes.\u201d</p><p>Mom gives me a look, like I obviously lose everything all the time now.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the last place you left them?\u201d Dad asks. \u201cJust picture it. That\u2019s how you find missing things.\u201d This is his typical advice, but it usually works. And sure enough, when I picture my shoes, still packed in the suitcase under my bed, that\u2019s where they are.</p><p>When we get downstairs, Dad does some halfhearted stretches. \u201cLet\u2019s see if I remember how to do this,\u201d he jokes. He\u2019s not much of a runner, but he\u2019s always telling his patients to exercise, so he tries to practice what he preaches.</p><p>We take off on a path toward the river. It is a true autumn day, clear and brisk with a sharp bite of winter in the air. I don\u2019t love running, not at first, but usually after ten minutes or so, that thing kicks in and I sort of zone out and forget what I\u2019m doing. Today, though, every time I even begin to lose myself, it\u2019s like my mind defaults to that other run, the best run, the run of my life, the run for my life. And then my legs turn into waterlogged tree trunks, and all the beautiful fall colors fade to gray.</p><p>After about a mile, I have to stop. I claim a cramp. I want to go back, but Dad wants to check out the downtown and see what\u2019s changed, so we do. We stop at a caf\u00e9 for cappuccinos, and Dad asks me about my classes and waxes nostalgic for his days in organic chemistry. Then he tells me how busy he\u2019s been and that Mom is having a really hard time and I should go easy on her.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t she supposed to be going back to work?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Dad looks at his watch. \u201cTime to go,\u201d he says.</p><p>Dad leaves me at the dorm to change before brunch. As soon as I step inside, I know something\u2019s wrong. I hear ticking. And then I look around, and for a second, I\u2019m confused because the dorm no longer looks like my dorm but like my bedroom at home. Mom has dug up all the posters from my closet and put them up in the exact same configuration as at home. She\u2019s moved my photos around, so they too are a mirror image of my old room. She\u2019s made the bed with a mountain of throw pillows, the throw pillows I specifically said I didn\u2019t want to bring because I hate throw pillows. You have to take them off and reorganize them every day. On top of the bed are clothes that Mom is folding into neat piles and laying out for me, just like she did when I was in fourth grade.</p><p>And along my windowsills and bookcases are all my clocks. All of them wound up and ticking.</p><p>Mom looks up from snipping the tags off a pair of pants I haven\u2019t even tried on. \u201cYou seemed so glum last night. I thought it might perk you up if it looked more like home in here. This is so much cheerier,\u201d she declares.</p><p>I begin to protest. But I\u2019m not sure what to protest.</p><p>\u201cAnd I spoke to Kali, and she finds the sound of the clocks soothing. Like a white-noise machine.\u201d</p><p>They don\u2019t sound soothing to me at all. They sound like a hundred time bombs waiting to explode.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>NOVEMBER</p><p>New York City</p><p>The last time I saw Melanie, she had a fading pink streak in her blond hair and was wearing her micro-skimp Topshop uniform with some teetering platform sandals she\u2019d picked up at the end-of-season sale at Macy\u2019s. So when she charges at me on a crowded street corner in New York\u2019s Chinatown as soon as I\u2019m disgorged from the bus, I hardly recognize her. Now the pink streak is gone; her hair is dyed dark brown with a reddish tint. She has severe bangs cut short across her forehead, and the rest of her hair is secured back into a bun with a pair of enamel chopsticks. She\u2019s wearing this weird, funky, flowered dress and a pair of beat-up cowboy boots, and she has cat-shaped granny eyeglasses on. Her lips are painted blood red. She looks amazing, even if she looks nothing like my Melanie. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At least when she hugs me, she still smells like Melanie: hair conditioner and baby powder. \u201cGod, you got skinny,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to gain your freshman fifteen, not lose it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you had dining hall food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hello, all-you-can-eat ice-cream bar. That alone makes the tuition worthwhile!\u201d</p><p>I pull back. Look at her again. Everything is new. Including the eyewear. \u201cYou need glasses?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re fake. Look, no lenses.\u201d She pokes through the air right to her eyes to demonstrate. \u201cIt\u2019s part of my whole punk-rock librarian look. The musician guys love it!\u201d She pulls off her glasses, sweeps down her hair. Laughs.</p><p>\u201cAnd no more blond hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want people to take me seriously.\u201d She puts her glasses back on and grabs the handle of my suitcase. \u201cSo, how\u2019s almost-Boston?\u201d</p><p>When I chose my college, Melanie made fun of the fact it was five miles outside of Boston, like the town we grew up in was twenty miles outside of Philadelphia. She\u2019d said I was circling urban life. She meanwhile, dove right in. Her school is in downtown Manhattan.</p><p>\u201cAlmost good,\u201d I answer. \u201cHow\u2019s New York?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeyond good! So much to do! Like tonight, we have options: There\u2019s a party at the dorm, a decent club with eighteen-and-over night on Lafayette, or a friend of a friend invited us to a loft party in Greenpoint, where this awesome band is playing. Or we could go to the last-minute tickets place in Times Square and see a Broadway show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m just here to see you.\u201d</p><p>I feel the slightest pang when I say that. Even though it is technically true that I\u2019m here to see her, it\u2019s not the whole story. I was going to see Melanie at home for Thanksgiving in a few days anyway, but when my parents booked my tickets, they said I had to take the train because flights were too unreliable and expensive on a holiday weekend.</p><p>When I imagined six hours on a train, I almost felt sick. Six hours of pushing back memories. Then Melanie mentioned that her parents were driving down the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to do some shopping and driving her back, so I got the brilliant idea to take the cheap Chinatown bus to New York and catch a lift back home with Melanie. I\u2019ll get the bus back to Boston too.</p><p>\u201cAww, I\u2019m happy to see you as well. Have we ever gone this long without seeing each other?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. Not since we met.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, so dorm party, Broadway show, club, or really kick-ass band in Brooklyn?\u201d</p><p>What I really want to do is go back to her room and watch movies and hang out like in the old days, but I suspect that if I suggested that, Melanie would accuse me of being adventure averse. The party in Brooklyn sounds the least appealing, and is probably what Melanie wants to do, so it\u2019s probably what I should choose. So I do.</p><p>It\u2019s like I picked the right answer on a test, the way her eyes light up. \u201cExcellent! Some of my friends from school are going. We\u2019ll eat first, then go back and drop your stuff and get ready and trek out together. Sound good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re already in Chinatown, and my favorite Vietnamese place is nearby.\u201d</p><p>As we wind through the twisty, crowded streets, full of red lanterns and paper umbrellas and fake pagodas, I try to keep my eyes on the sidewalk. There are signs everywhere. One of them will inevitably say double happiness. Paris is more than three thousand miles away, but the memories . . . One pops up, I push it away. But then another appears. I never know when one is going to jump out at me. They are buried everywhere, like land mines.</p><p>We go into a tiny restaurant, all fluorescent lights and Formica tables, and sit down at a corner table. Melanie orders us some spring rolls and a chicken dish and tea and then she folds up her glasses and puts them into a case (to better protect the imaginary lenses?). After she pours us each a cup of tea, she looks at me and says, \u201cSo, you\u2019re doing better?\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not so much a question as a command. Melanie saw me at my absolute lowest. When I got back from Paris and completely lost it, she let me cry all night long, cursing Willem for being a sleazy scoundrel just like she\u2019d suspected all along. On the flight home, she cast scathing looks at anyone on the plane who looked at me funny when I kept crying for the entire eight-hour trip. When, somewhere over Greenland, I started hyperventilating, wondering if maybe I hadn\u2019t made an epic mistake, if maybe something hadn\u2019t happened, if maybe he hadn\u2019t got waylaid, she\u2019d set me straight.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. He did. He got way laid. By you! And then he got the hell out of Dodge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if . . . \u201d I\u2019d begun.</p><p>\u201cAllyson, come on. In one day, you saw him get undressed by one girl, take a secret note from another, and God knows what happened on the train with those other girls; how you think he really got that stain on his jeans?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t even thought of that.</p><p>She\u2019d taken me into the tiny airplane bathroom and shoved the Sous ou Sur T-shirt in the garbage. Then we\u2019d flushed the coin he\u2019d given me down the toilet, where I imagined it falling all those thousands of feet, sinking into the ocean below.</p><p>\u201cThere, we\u2019ve destroyed all evidence of him,\u201d she\u2019d said.</p><p>Well, almost. I hadn\u2019t told her about the photo on my phone, the one Agnethe took of the two of us. I still haven\u2019t deleted it, though I haven\u2019t looked at it, not even once.</p><p>When we got back home, Melanie was ready to put the trip behind her and turn her attention to our next chapter: college. I understood. I should\u2019ve been excited too. I just wasn\u2019t. Every day we schlepped to IKEA and Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, to American Apparel and J. Crew with our moms. But it was like I had a permanent case of jet lag; all I wanted to do was take naps on the display beds. When Melanie left for school two days before me, I burst into tears. Everyone else thought I was crying for the pending separation from my best friend, but Melanie knew better, which was maybe why she sounded a little impatient when she hugged me and whispered into my ear, \u201cIt was just one day, Allyson. You\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>So when Melanie asks me now if I\u2019m better, I can\u2019t let her down. \u201cYes,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019m great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She claps her hands together and pulls out her phone. She fires off a text. \u201cThere\u2019s a guy going tonight, a friend of my friend Trevor. I think you\u2019ll like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said you\u2019re over the Dutch dickwad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>She stares at me. \u201cThe first three months of college are the most action you\u2019re supposed to get in your life. Have you so much as blinked at a guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve mostly kept my eyes closed during all the wild orgies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Nice try. You forget I know you better than anyone. I\u2019ll bet you haven\u2019t even kissed anyone.\u201d</p><p>I pull the weird innardy parts out of the spring roll, wiping the excess grease on a paper napkin. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the guy I want you to meet tonight. He\u2019s way more your type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Though I know what it means. It was absurd to think that he was ever my type. Or I his.</p><p>\u201cNice. Normal. I showed him your picture and he said you looked dark and mysterious.\u201d She reaches out to touch my hair. \u201cThough you should cut your hair into the bob again. Right now it\u2019s more of a blob.\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t cut my hair since London, and it hangs down my neck in a messy curtain.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the look I\u2019m going for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re achieving it. But anyhow he\u2019s really nice, Mason\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMason? What kind of name is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting hung up on a name? You sound just like your mother.\u201d</p><p>I resist the urge to stab her through the eye with a chopstick.</p><p>\u201cAnyhow, who cares? Maybe his name is really Jason but he just wanted to call himself Mason,\u201d Melanie continues. \u201cSpeaking of, no one calls me Melanie here. They call me Mel or Lainie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo names for the price of one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s college, Allyson. No one knows who you were. There\u2019s never a better time to reinvent yourself. You should try it.\u201d She gives me a pointed look.</p><p>I want to tell her that I did. It just didn\u2019t take.</p><p>Mason actually turns out to be not that bad. He\u2019s smart and slightly nerdy, and from the South, which explains the name, I guess, and he speaks in a lilting accent, which he makes fun of. When we get to the party on a desolate stretch of windblown street, miles from the subway stop, he jokes that he\u2019s from the hipster police and do I have enough tattoos to be in this part of town. At which point Trevor shows off his tribal armband and Melanie starts talking about the \u201ctat\u201d she\u2019s thinking of getting on her ankle or butt or other places girls get them, and Mason looks at me and rolls his eyes a little.</p><p>At the party, an elevator opens up directly into a loft, which is both huge and decrepit, with giant canvases all over the walls and the smell of oil paint and turpentine. It smelled like this in the squat. Another land mine. I kick it away before it explodes.</p><p>Melanie and Trevor are going on and on about this kick-ass band, whose grainy video they show me on Melanie\u2019s phone. They\u2019re congratulating themselves on seeing them at a place like this, before the whole world discovers them. When the band fires up, Melanie\u2014Mel, Lainie, whoever\u2014and Trevor hop to the front and start dancing like crazy. Mason hangs back with me. It\u2019s too loud to attempt conversation, which I\u2019m glad about, but I\u2019m also glad that someone stayed with me. I feel my tourist sign flashing, and I\u2019m on native soil.</p><p>After what seems like forever, the band finally takes a break; the ringing in my ears is so loud it\u2019s like they\u2019re still playing.</p><p>\u201cCare for a libation?\u201d Mason asks me.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I\u2019m still half deaf.</p><p>He mimes drinking something.</p><p>\u201cOh, no thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll. Be. Right. Back,\u201d he says, exaggerating the words like we\u2019re lip-reading.</p><p>Meanwhile, Melanie and Trevor are doing a kind of lip-reading of their own. They\u2019re in a corner on a couch, making out. It\u2019s like they don\u2019t notice anyone else in the room. I don\u2019t want to watch them, but I can\u2019t seem to stop myself. Seeing them kiss makes me physically ill. It\u2019s hard to push that memory down. The hardest. It\u2019s why I keep it buried the deepest.</p><p>Mason comes back with a beer for himself and a water for me. He sees Melanie and Trevor. \u201cIt was bound to happen,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThose two have been circling each other for weeks like a pair of dogs in heat. I wondered what was going to trip the wire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlcohol and \u2018kick-ass\u2019 music,\u201d I say, making air quotes.</p><p>\u201cVacations. Easier to start something up when you know you don\u2019t have to see someone for a while. Takes the pressure off.\u201d He glances at them. \u201cI give them two weeks, tops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks? That\u2019s pretty generous. Some guys wouldn\u2019t give it more than a night.\u201d Even over the din, I can hear my bitterness. I can taste it in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give you more than a night,\u201d Mason says.</p><p>And, oh, it is so the right thing to say. And who knows? Maybe he\u2019s even sincere, though by now I know that I cannot be trusted to discern sincerity from fakery.</p><p>But still, I want to be over this. I want all those memories to disappear or to be supplanted with something else, to stop haunting me. So when Mason leans in to kiss me, I close my eyes, and I let him. I try to lose myself in it, try not to worry if the bitterness in my mouth has actually given me bad breath. I try to be kissed by someone else, try to be someone else.</p><p>But then Mason touches my neck, to the spot on it where the cut from that night has since healed, and I pull away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He was right, after all; it didn\u2019t leave a scar, though part of me wishes it had.

It\u2019s like our vacation baptism. We\u2019ve done it for every one of the last nine years we\u2019ve come down here.</p><p>But this year, when Melanie digs through her suitcase for a bikini, I go to the little desk next to the kitchen that normally holds nothing but cookbooks and prop open my textbooks. Every day, from four to six, I am to have study hall. I get New Year\u2019s Day off, but that\u2019s it. These are the terms of my parole.</p><p>I kept my grades a secret throughout the entire semester, so when the report cards showed up at the end of the term, it was kind of a shocker. I\u2019d tried. I really had. After my midterms were so dismal, I\u2019d tried harder, but it wasn\u2019t like my bad grades were a result of slacking off. Or skipping classes. Or partying.</p><p>But I might as well have been partying, given how tired I was all the time. It didn\u2019t matter if I got ten hours of sleep the night before\u2014once I set foot in the lecture hall and the professor started droning on about wave motion, writing up equations on the monitor, the numbers would start dancing before my eyes and then I\u2019d feel my lids grow heavy, and I\u2019d wake to other students tripping over my legs to get to their next class.</p><p>During Reading Week, I drank so much espresso that I got no sleep at all, as if I was using up all the credits from the class naps. I crammed as hard as I could, but by that point, I\u2019d fallen so behind, I was beyond help.</p> <p>Given all that, I thought it was miraculous I finished the semester with a 2.7.</p><p>Needless to say, my parents thought otherwise.</p><p>When my grades came through last week, they flipped out. And when my parents flip out, they don\u2019t yell\u2014they get quiet. But their disappointment and anger is deafening.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think we should do about this, Allyson?\u201d they asked me as we sat at the dining room table, as if they were truly soliciting my opinion. Then they presented two options. We could cancel the trip, which would be terribly unfair for the rest of them, or I could agree to go under certain conditions.</p><p>Melanie shoots me sympathy looks as she disappears to change into her suit. Part of me wishes she\u2019d boycott the beach in solidarity, though I know that\u2019s selfish, but it seems like something the old Melanie would\u2019ve done.</p><p>But this is the new Melanie. Or the new, new Melanie. In the month since Thanksgiving, she looks totally different. Again. She cut her hair all asymmetrical and fringy, and she got a nose ring, which her parents gave her crap about until she told them it was between that and a tattoo. Now that she\u2019s changed into a bikini, I see that she\u2019s let her armpit hair grow, though her hair is so fine and blond, it barely shows.</p> <p>\u201cBye,\u201d she mouths as she slips out the front door, her mom, Susan, thrusting a tube of SPF-40 into her hands. My mom is digging through a suitcase for her special magnifying glass so she can check all mattresses for bedbugs. When she finds it, she walks by me and pretends to look at my chem book with it. I snap the book shut. She gives me a pissy look.</p><p>\u201cYou think I want to be your warden? I thought I\u2019d have all this free time now that you\u2019re in college, but it\u2019s like keeping you on track is its own full-time job.\u201d</p><p>Who asked you to keep me on track? I fume. In my head. But I bite my lip and open the chemistry textbook out and dutifully reread the first chapters as Mom has instructed me to do for catch-up. They make no more sense to me now than they did the first time I attempted them.</p><p>That night, we all six go out to dinner at the Mexican restaurant, one of the eight restaurants attached to the resort. We go here every year for our first night out. The waiters wear giant sombreros, and there\u2019s a traveling mariachi band, but the food tastes the same as it does at El Torrito back home. When the waiter takes our drink orders, Melanie asks for a beer.</p><p>The parents gawk at her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re legal to drink here,\u201d she says casually.</p><p>Mom gives Susan a look. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s wise,\u201d Mom says.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I challenge.</p> <p>\u201cIf you want my opinion, it has to less to do with the age than the expectation. You\u2019ve grown up with a drinking age of twenty-one, so you\u2019re not necessarily prepared for drinking now,\u201d is Susan\u2019s therapist answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but did you not go to college?\u201d I ask. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s changed that much. Do you not remember how all anyone does is drink?\u201d</p><p>My parents look at each other, then at Susan and Steve.</p><p>\u201cIs that\u2019s what going on with you? Have you been drinking too much at school?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>Melanie laughs so hard that the special bottled water Mom brings sprays through her nose. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Frank, but do you not even know Allyson?\u201d They continue to stare. \u201cOn the tour last summer, everyone drank.\u201d There is a moment of shocked silence. \u201cOh, spare me! The legal drinking age in Europe is eighteen! Anyhow, everyone drank but Allyson. She\u2019s totally straight and narrow. And you\u2019re asking if she\u2019s boozing it up at college? That\u2019s ludicrous.\u201d</p><p>My dad stares at me, then at Melanie. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to understand what\u2019s going on with her. Why she got a two-seven GPA.\u201d</p><p>Now it\u2019s Melanie\u2019s turn to gawk. \u201cYou got a two-seven?\u201d She clamps her hand over her lips and mouths, \u201cSorry.\u201d The look she gives me is one part surprise, one part respect.</p><p>\u201cMelanie got a three-point-eight,\u201d Mom brags.</p><p>\u201cYes, Melanie is a genius, and I am an idiot. It\u2019s official.\u201d</p><p>Melanie looks wounded. \u201cI go to the Gallatin School. Everyone gets As,\u201d she says apologetically.</p><p>\u201cAnd Melanie probably drinks,\u201d I say, knowing full well she does.</p><p>She looks nervous for a second. \u201cOf course I do. I don\u2019t pass out or anything. But it\u2019s college. I drink. Everyone drinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd Melanie has the A average, and I have the C, so maybe I should go on a few benders and things will even out. Maybe that\u2019s a much better idea than this stupid study hall you have me in.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m really into this now, which is kind of crazy, because I don\u2019t even want a beer. One of the few things I like about this restaurant is the virgin margaritas\u2014they\u2019re made with fresh fruit.</p><p>Mom turns to me, her mouth ready to catch some flies. \u201cAllyson, do you have a drinking problem?\u201d</p><p>I smack my hand to my head. \u201cMother, do you have a hearing problem? Because I don\u2019t know that you heard a word I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s saying that you might ease up a little and let them have a beer with dinner,\u201d Susan says.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d I say to Susan.</p><p>My mom looks to my dad. \u201cLet the girls have a beer,\u201d he says expansively as he waves the waiter back over and asks for a couple of Tecates.</p><p>It\u2019s a victory of sorts. Except that I don\u2019t actually like beer, so in the end, I have to pretend to sip from mine as it grows sweaty on the table, and I don\u2019t order the virgin margarita I really wanted.</p><p>The next day, Melanie and I are sitting at the giant pool together. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve managed to be alone since we got here.</p><p>\u201cI think we should do something different,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I say. \u201cEvery year we come down here and we do the same things. We go to the same frigging ruins, even. Tulum is nice, but I was thinking we could branch out. Talk our parents into going somewhere new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike swimming with the dolphins?\u201d Melanie asks.</p><p>Dolphin swimming is different, but it\u2019s not what I\u2019m after. Yesterday, I was looking at the map of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in the lobby, and some of the ruins are inland, more off the beaten path. Maybe we\u2019d find a bit more of the real Mexico. \u201cI was thinking we could go to Coba or Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. Different ruins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re so wild,\u201d Melanie teases. She takes a slurp of iced tea. \u201cAnyhow, I\u2019m talking about New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. You mean you don\u2019t want to do the Macarena with Johnny Maximo?\u201d Johnny Maximo is this washed-up Mexican movie star who now has some job with the resort. All the mothers love him because he\u2019s handsome and macho and is always pretending to mistake them for our sisters.</p><p>\u201cAnything but the Macarena!\u201d Melanie puts down her book, something by Rita Mae Brown that looks like it\u2019s for school but Melanie says is not. \u201cOne of the bartenders told me about some big party on the beach in Puerto Morelos. It\u2019s a local thing, though he says lots of tourists come, but people like us. Young people. There\u2019s going to be a Mexican reggae band, which sounds bizarre. In a good way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just looking for a guy under sixty to make out with come midnight.\u201d</p><p>Melanie shrugs. \u201cUnder sixty, yes. A guy? Maybe not.\u201d She gives me a look.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve sort of being doing the girl thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d It comes out a shout. \u201cSorry. Since when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince right after Thanksgiving. There was this one girl and we met in film theory class and we were friends and one night we went out and it just happened.\u201d</p><p>I look at the new haircut, the nose ring, the hairy armpits. It all makes sense. \u201cSo, are you a lesbian now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer not to label it,\u201d she says, somewhat sanctimoniously, the implication being that I need to label everything. She\u2019s the one who\u2019s constantly branding herself: Mel, Mel 2.0. Punk-rock librarian. I ask her girlfriend\u2019s name. She tells me they\u2019re not into defining it like that, but her name is Zanne.</p><p>\u201cIs that with an X?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZ. Short for Suzanne.\u201d</p><p>Doesn\u2019t anybody use a real name anymore?</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell my parents, okay? You know my mom. She\u2019d make us process it and talk about it as a phase of my development. I want to make sure this is more than a fling before I subject myself to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, you don\u2019t have to tell me about parental overanalysis.\u201d</p><p>She pushes her sunglasses up her nose and turns to me. \u201cYeah, so what\u2019s that all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? You\u2019ve met my parents. Is there a part of my life they\u2019re not involved in? They must be freaking out to not have their fingers literally in every aspect of what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And when I heard about the study hall, I figured it was that. I thought maybe you had a low B average. But a two\u2014point\u2014seven? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you start on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m just surprised. You\u2019ve always been such a kick-ass student. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d She takes a loud slurp of her mostly melted iced tea. \u201cThe Therapist says you\u2019re depressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom? She told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard her mention it to your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did my mom say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you weren\u2019t depressed. That you were pouting because you weren\u2019t used to being punished. Sometimes I really want to smack your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyhow, later on my mom asked me if I thought you were depressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019d you tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said lots of people have a hard time freshman year.\u201d She gives me a sharp look from behind her dark glasses. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell her the truth, could I? That I thought you were still pining for some guy you had a one-night stand with in Paris.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pause, listening to the shriek of a little kid jumping off the high dive. When Melanie and I were little, we used to hold hands and jump together, over and over again.</p><p>\u201cBut what if it\u2019s not him? Not Willem.\u201d It\u2019s weird saying his name out loud. Here. After embargoing it for so long. Willem. I scarcely even allow myself to think it in my head.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me another guy dicked you over!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m talking about me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s, like, the me I was that day. I was different somehow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was Lulu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that was just a name. Just pretend.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe it was. But still, that whole day, being with Willem, being Lulu, it made me realize that all my life I\u2019ve been living in a small, square room, with no windows and no doors. And I was fine. I was happy, even. I thought. Then someone came along and showed me there was a door in the room. One that I\u2019d never even seen before. Then he opened it for me. Held my hand as I walked through it. And for one perfect day, I was on the other side. I was somewhere else. Someone else. And then he was gone, and I was thrown back into my little room. And now, no matter what I do, I can\u2019t seem to find that door.</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel pretend,\u201d I tell Melanie.</p><p>Melanie arranges her face in sympathy. \u201cOh, sweetie. It\u2019s because you were all hopped up on the fumes of infatuation. And Paris. But people don\u2019t change overnight. Especially you. You\u2019re Allyson. You\u2019re so solid. It\u2019s one of the things I love about you\u2014how reliably you are.\u201d</p><p>I want to protest. What about transformations? What about the reinvention she\u2019s always going on about? Are those only reserved for her? Is there a different standard for me?</p><p>\u201cYou know what you need? Some Ani DeFranco.\u201d She pulls out her iPhone and shoves the buds in my ears, and as Ani goes on about finding your voice and making it heard, I feel so frustrated with myself. Like I want to pull my skin wide open and step out of it. I scrape my feet against the hot cement floor and sigh, wishing there was someone I could explain this to. Someone who might understand what I\u2019m feeling.</p><p>And for one small second, I do imagine the person I could talk to, about finding this door, and losing it. He would understand.</p> <p>But that\u2019s the one door that needs to stay shut.</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Somehow, using the same we\u2019re-adults-you-have-to-treat-us-that-way argument from the Beer Dinner, plus promising to hire a hotel-approved taxi for the entire night, Melanie and I manage to procure parental permission to go to that New Year\u2019s Eve party. It\u2019s being held on a narrow crescent of sand, all lit up with tiki torches, and at ten o\u2019clock, it\u2019s already slamming. There is a low stage on which the touted Mexican reggae band will play, though right now a d.j. is playing techno.</p><p>There are several giant piles of discarded shoes. Melanie tosses off her bright-orange flip-flops. I hesitate before taking off my less conspicuous black leather sandals, hoping I\u2019ll find them again, because if I lose anything else, I swear I will never hear the end of it.</p><p>\u201cQuite the bacchanal,\u201d Melanie says approvingly, nodding to the guys in swim trunks holding bottles of tequila by the neck, the girls in sarongs with their hair freshly cornrowed. There are even actual Mexicans here, the guys smartly dressed in sheer white shirts, hair slicked back, and the girls in fancy party dresses, cut up to there, legs long and brown.</p><p>\u201cDance first or drink first?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t want to dance. So I say drink. We line up at the packed bar. Behind us is a group of French-speaking people, which makes me do a double take. There\u2019s hardly anyone but Americans at our hotel, but of course people from everywhere come to Mexico.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Melanie shoves a drink into my hand. It\u2019s in a hollowed-out piece of pineapple. I take a sniff. It smells like suntan lotion. It is sweet and warm and burns slightly going down. \u201cGood girl.\u201d</p> <p>I think of Ms. Foley. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that either.\u201d</p><p>She looks peeved. \u201cNothing girl.\u201d</p><p>We drink our drinks in silence, taking in the growing party. \u201cLet\u2019s dance,\u201d Melanie says, yanking me toward the ring of sand that has been allocated as the dance floor.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p><p>And there\u2019s that sigh again. \u201cAre you going to be like this all night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I think of what she called me on the tour\u2014adventure averse\u2014and what she said at the pool. \u201cSo like me? I thought that\u2019s what you loved about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your problem? You\u2019ve had a stick up your ass this whole trip! It\u2019s not my fault your mom is Study-Hall Nazi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it is your fault for making me feel like crap because I don\u2019t want to dance. I hate techno. I have always hated techno, so you should know that, what with me being so reliably me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Why don\u2019t you be reliably you and sit on the sidelines while I dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>She leaves me on the perimeter of the circle and goes off and just starts dancing with random people. First she dances with some guy with dreadlocks and then turns and dances with a girl with super-short hair. She seems to be having a fine time out there, swirling, twirling, and it strikes me that if I didn\u2019t already know her, she would no longer be someone I would know.</p><p>I watch her for at least twenty minutes. In between the monotonous techno songs, she talks to other people, laughs. After a half hour, I\u2019m getting a headache. I try to catch her eye, but I eventually give up and slip away.</p><p>The party stretches all the way down the curve of the water\u2014and into it\u2014where a bunch of people are skinny-dipping in the moonlit sea. A little way\u2019s farther down, it gets more mellow, with a bonfire and people around it playing guitar. I plant myself a few feet away from the bonfire, close enough to feel its heat and hear the crackle of wood. I dig my feet into the sand; the top layer is cool, but underneath it\u2019s still warm from the day\u2019s sunshine.</p><p>Down the beach, the techno stops, and the reggae band takes the stage. The more mellow bump-bump-thump is nice. In the water, a girl starts dancing on a guy\u2019s shoulder, pulls off her bikini top, and stands there, half naked like a moonshine mermaid, before diving in with a quiet splash. Behind me, the guys on guitars start up with \u201cStairway to Heaven.\u201d It mingles strangely well with the reggae.</p><p>I lie down in the sand and look up at the sky. From this vantage point, it\u2019s like I have the beach all to myself. The band finishes a song, and the singer announces that it\u2019s a half hour until the New Year. \u201cNew Year. A\u00f1o nuevo. It\u2019s a tabula rasa. Time to hacer borr\u00f3n y cuenta nueva,\u201d he chants. \u201cOne chance to wipe the board clean.\u201d</p><p>Can you really do that? Wipe the board clean? Would I even want to? Would I wipe all of last year away if I could?</p><p>\u201cTabula rasa,\u201d the singer repeats. \u201cA new chance to start over. Start fresh, baby. Make amends. Make ch-ch-changes. To be who you want to be. Come the stroke of midnight, before you kiss your amor, save un beso para t\u00ed. Close your eyes, think of the year ahead. This is your chance. This can be the day it all changes.\u201d</p><p>Really? It\u2019s a nice idea, but why January first? You might as well say April nineteenth is the day that everything changes. A day is a day is a day. It means nothing.</p><p>\u201cAt the stroke of midnight, make your wish. Qu\u00e9 es tu deseo? For yourself. For the world.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s New Year\u2019s. Not a birthday cake. And I\u2019m not eight anymore. I don\u2019t believe in wishes coming true. But if I did, what would I wish for? To undo that day? To see him again?</p><p>Normally I have such willpower. Like a dieter resisting a cookie, I don\u2019t even let myself go there. But for the briefest second, I do. I picture him right here, walking down the beach, hair reflecting in the flames, eyes dark and light and full of teasing, and of so many other things. And for a second, I almost see him.</p><p>As I open myself to the fantasy, I wait for the accompanying clench of pain. But it doesn\u2019t come. Instead my breath slows and something warms inside me. I abandon caution and all good sense and wrap myself in thoughts of him. My own hands circle around my chest, as if he were holding me. For one brief moment, everything feels right.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d never find you!\u201d</p><p>I look up. Melanie is striding toward me. \u201cI\u2019ve been right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you for the last half hour! Up and down the beach. I had no idea where you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI looked everywhere for you. The party\u2019s getting totally out of control, like roofies-in-the-punch wild. Some girl just puked six inches from my feet, and guys are hitting on me with the worst pickup lines in the world. I\u2019ve had my ass pinched more times than I can count, and one charming guy just asked me if I wanted a bite of his sandwich\u2014and he wasn\u2019t talking about food!\u201d She shakes her head as if trying to dislodge the memory. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to have each other\u2019s backs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. You were having fun, and I guess I just lost track of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost track of time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so. I\u2019m really sorry you were worried. But I\u2019m fine. Do you want to go back to the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I\u2019m over it. Let\u2019s leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to.\u201d I look toward the bonfire. The flames are dancing, making it hard to pull my gaze away. \u201cI don\u2019t mind staying.\u201d For the first time in a long while, I am having an okay time, I\u2019m okay being where I am.</p><p>\u201cWell, I do. I\u2019ve spent the last half hour panicking, and now I\u2019m sober, and I\u2019m beyond over this place. It\u2019s like a Telemundo frat party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay. Let\u2019s go then.\u201d</p><p>I follow her back to the shoe piles, where it takes ages for her to find her flip-flops, and then we get into our waiting taxi. By the time I think to look at the dashboard clock, it\u2019s twenty past twelve. I don\u2019t really believe what the singer said about midnight wishes, but now that I\u2019ve missed mine, I feel like I should\u2019ve tried before the window of opportunity closed.</p><p>We ride home in silence, save for the cab driver softly singing to his radio. When we pull into the gates of the resort, Melanie hands him some bills, and for a minute, I get an idea.</p><p>\u201cMelanie. What if we hire this guy in a day or two and go off somewhere, away from the tourists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would we want to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. To see what would happen if we tried something different. Excuse me, se\u00f1or, how much would it be for us to hire you for a whole day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLo siento. No hablo ingl\u00e9s.\u201d</p><p>Melanie rolls her eyes at me. \u201cI guess you have to be satisfied with your one big adventure.\u201d</p><p>At first I think she means this party, but then I realize she means the ruins. Because I did actually manage to get our families to visit a different ruin. We went to Coba instead of Tulum. And just as I\u2019d hoped, we stopped at a small village along the way, and for a moment there, I\u2019d gotten excited, thinking this was it, I had actually escaped into the real Mexico. Okay, my whole family was in tow, but it was a Mayan village. Except then Susan and my mom went crazy buying beaded jewelry, and the villagers came out and played drums for us, and we all were invited to dance in a circle and then there was even a traditional spiritual cleansing. But everyone was videoing everything, and after his cleansing, my dad \u201cdonated\u201d ten dollars to a hat that was conspicuously put in front of us, and I realized that this was no different from being on the tour.</p><p>The condo is quiet. The parents are all in bed, though as soon as the door closes Mom pops out of her bedroom. \u201cYou\u2019re early,\u201d she says. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was tired,\u201d Melanie lies. \u201cGood night. Happy New Year.\u201d She pads off toward our room, and Mom gives me a New Year\u2019s kiss and goes back to hers.</p><p>I\u2019m nowhere near tired, so I sit out on the balcony and listen to the dwindling sounds of the hotel\u2019s party. On the horizon, a lightning storm is brewing. I reach into my purse for my phone and, for the first time in months, open the photo album.</p><p>His face is so beautiful, it makes my stomach twist. But he seems unreal, not someone I would ever know. But then I look at me, the me in the photo, and I hardly recognize her, either, and not just because the hair is different, but because she seems different. That\u2019s not me. That\u2019s Lulu. And she\u2019s just as gone as he is.</p><p>Tabula rasa. That\u2019s what the reggae singer said. Maybe I can\u2019t get my wish, but I can try to wipe the slate clean, try to get over this.</p> <p>I allow myself look at the picture of Willem and Lulu in Paris for a long minute.</p><p>\u201cHappy New Year,\u201d I tell them.</p><p>And then I erase them.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>JANUARY</p> <p>College</p><p>Two feet of snow fall in Boston while I\u2019m in Mexico, and the temperature never rises above freezing, so when I get back two weeks later, campus looks like a depressing gray tundra. I arrive a few days before classes start, with excuses of getting prepped for the new semester, but really because I could not handle being at home, under the watchful eye of the warden, one day longer. It had been bad enough in Canc\u00fan, but home, without Melanie to distract me\u2014she took off for New York City the day after we got back, before we got a chance to ever resolve the weirdness that had settled between us\u2014it was unbearable.</p><p>The Terrific Trio comes back from break full of stories and inside jokes. They spent New Year\u2019s together at Kendra\u2019s family\u2019s Virginia Beach condo and went swimming in the snow, and now they are ordering themselves Polar Bear T-shirts. They\u2019re nice enough, asking about my trip, but I find it hard to breathe with all that bonhomie, so I pile on my sweaters and parkas and trudge over to the U bookstore to pick up a new Mandarin workbook.</p><p>I\u2019m in the foreign languages section when my cell phone rings. I don\u2019t even need to look at the caller ID. Mom has been calling at least twice a day since I got back.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllyson Healey.\u201d The voice on the other end is high and winsome, the opposite of Mom.</p> <p>\u201cYes, this is Allyson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hello, Allyson. This is Gretchen Price from the guidance office.\u201d</p><p>I pause, breathing through the sickening feeling in my stomach. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering if you might like to stop by my office. Say hello.\u201d</p><p>Now I feel like I\u2019m going to throw up right on the stacks of Buon Giorno Italiano. \u201cDid my mother call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d I hear the sound of something knocking over. \u201cDamn. Hang on.\u201d There\u2019s more shuffling and then she\u2019s back on the line. \u201cLook, I apologize for the last-minute notice, but that seems to be my MO these days. I\u2019d love for you to come in before the term starts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm, the terms starts the day after tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it does. How about today, then?\u201d</p> <p>They are going to kick me out. I\u2019ve blown it in one term. They know I\u2019m not a Happy College Student. I don\u2019t belong in the catalog. Or here. \u201cAm I in some kind of trouble?\u201d</p><p>That tinkling laugh again. \u201cNot with me. Why don\u2019t you come by\u2014hang on.\u201d There\u2019s more shuffling of paper. \u201cHow about four?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure my mother didn\u2019t call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Allyson, I\u2019m quite sure. So four?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just getting-to-know-you stuff. I\u2019ll see you at four.\u201d</p><p>Gretchen Price\u2019s office is in a crowded corner of the ivy-covered administration buildings. Stacks of books and papers and magazines are scattered everywhere, on the round table and chairs by the window, on the love seat, on her messy desk.</p><p>She is on the phone when I\u2019m ushered in, so I just stand there in the doorway. She gestures for me to come inside. \u201cYou must be Allyson. Just move a pile off the chair and take a seat. I\u2019ll be with you in a second.\u201d</p><p>I move a dirty Raggedy Ann doll with one of the braids chopped off and a stack of folders from one of the chairs. Some of the folders have sticky notes on them: Yes. No. Maybe. Paperwork slips out of one. It\u2019s a printout of a college application, like the one I sent in a year ago. I shove it back into the folder and put it on the next chair.</p><p>Gretchen hangs up the phone. \u201cSo, Allyson, how\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going fine.\u201d I glance at all the applications, all the comers who want a spot like mine. \u201cGreat in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She picks up a file, and I have the distinct impression my goose is cooked.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I say with all the chipperness I can muster.</p><p>\u201cSee, the thing is, I\u2019ve been looking at your first-term grades.\u201d</p><p>I feel tears spring to my eyes. She lured me here under false pretenses. She said I wasn\u2019t in trouble, it was just a getting-to-know-you session. And I didn\u2019t fail. I just got Cs!</p><p>She looks at my stricken face and motions for me to calm down with her hands. \u201cRelax, Allyson,\u201d she says in a soothing voice. \u201cI\u2019m not here to bust you. I just want to see if you need some help, and to offer it if that\u2019s the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my first term. I was adjusting.\u201d I\u2019ve used this excuse so much I\u2019ve almost come to believe it.</p><p>She leans back in her chair. \u201cYou know, people tend think that college admissions is inherently unfair. That you can\u2019t judge people from paper. But the thing is, paper can actually tell you an awful lot.\u201d She takes a gulp from one of those coffee cups that kids paint. Hers is covered in smudgy pastel thumbprints. \u201cHaving never met you before, but judging just from what I\u2019m seeing on paper, I suspect that you\u2019re struggling a bit.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s not asking me if I\u2019m struggling. She\u2019s not asking why I\u2019m struggling. She just knows. The tears come, and I let them. Relief is more powerful than shame.</p><p>\u201cLet me be clear,\u201d Gretchen continues, sliding over a box of tissues. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about your GPA. First-term slides are as common as the freshman fifteen. Oh, man, you should\u2019ve seen my first-semester GPA.\u201d She shakes her head and laughs. \u201cGenerally, struggling students here fall into two categories: Those getting used to the freedom, maybe spending a little too much time at the keg parties, not enough time in the library. They generally straighten out after a term or two.\u201d She looks at me. \u201cAre you pounding too many shots of J\u00e4germeister, Allyson?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head, even though by the tone of her question, it seems like she already knows the answer.</p><p>She nods. \u201cSo the other pattern is a bit more insidious. But it\u2019s actually a predictor for dropouts. And that\u2019s why I wanted to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m going to drop out?\u201d</p><p>She stares hard at me. \u201cNo. But looking at your records from high school and your first term, you fit a pattern.\u201d She waves around a file, which obviously contains my whole academic history. \u201cStudents like you, young women, in particular, do extraordinarily well in high school. Look at your grades. Across the board, they\u2019re excellent. AP, science classes, humanities classes, all As. Extremely high SAT scores. Then you get into college, which is supposedly why you\u2019ve been working so hard, right?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cWell you get here, and you crumple. You\u2019d be surprised how many of my straight-A, straight-and-narrow students wind up dropping out.\u201d She shakes her head in dismay. \u201cI hate it when that happens. I help choose who goes here. It reflects badly on me if they crash and burn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a doctor losing a patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat analogy. See how smart you are?\u201d</p><p>I offer a rueful smile.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, Allyson, college is supposed to be . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best years of my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to say nourishing. An adventure. An exploration. I\u2019m looking at you, and you don\u2019t seem nourished. And I\u2019m looking at your schedule. . . .\u201d She peers at her computer screen. \u201cBiology, chemistry. Physics. Mandarin. Labs. It\u2019s very ambitious for your first year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pre-med,\u201d I say. \u201cI have to take those classes.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t say anything. She takes another gulp of coffee. Then she says. \u201cAre those the classes you want to take?\u201d</p><p>I pause. Nobody has ever asked me that. When we got the course catalog in the mail, it was just assumed I\u2019d tackle all the pre-med requirements. Mom knew just what I should take when. I\u2019d looked at some electives, had mentioned that I thought pottery sounded cool, but I may as well have said I was planning on majoring in underwater basket weaving.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I want to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a look and see about switching things up a bit. Registration is still in flux, and I might be able to pull some strings.\u201d She stops and pushes the catalog clear across the desk. \u201cEven if you do wind up pre-med, you have four years to take these classes, and you have a lot of humanities requisites to get in too. You don\u2019t need to jam everything together all at once. This isn\u2019t medical school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let them down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if it means letting yourself down? Which I doubt they\u2019d want for you.\u201d</p><p>The tears come again. She hands me another tissue.</p><p>\u201cI understand about wanting to please your parents, to make them proud. It\u2019s a noble impulse, and I commend you for it. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s your education, Allyson. You have to own it. And you should enjoy it.\u201d She pauses, slurps some more coffee. \u201cAnd somehow I imagine that your parents will be happier if they see your GPA come up.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s right about that. I nod. She turns to her computer screen. \u201cSo, let\u2019s just pretend we\u2019re going to jiggle some classes around. Any idea of what you might like to take?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head.</p><p>She grabs the course catalog and flips through it. \u201cCome on. It\u2019s an intellectual buffet. Archaeology. Salsa dancing. Child development. Painting. Intro to finance. Journalism. Anthropology. Ceramics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that like pottery?\u201d I interrupt.</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d She widens her eyes and taps on her computer. \u201cBeginning Ceramics, Tuesdays at eleven. It\u2019s open. Oh, but it conflicts with your physics lab. Shall we postpone the lab, and maybe physics, for another term?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut them.\u201d Saying it feels wonderful, like letting go of a bunch of helium balloons and watching them disappear into the sky.</p><p>\u201cSee? You\u2019re already getting the hang of it,\u201d Gretchen says. \u201cHow about some humanities, to balance you out? You\u2019re going to need those to graduate anyway as part of your core curriculum. Are you more interested in ancient history or modern history? There\u2019s a wonderful European survey. And a great seminar on the Russian Revolution. Or a fascinating American Pre-Revolution class that makes excellent use of our being so close to Boston. Or you could get started on some of your literature classes. Let\u2019s see. Your AP exams tested you out of the basic writing requirement. You know, we could be devilish and slip you into one of the more interesting seminar classes.\u201d She scrolls down her computer. \u201cBeat Poetry. Holocaust Literature. Politics in Prose. Medieval Verse. Shakespeare Out Loud.\u201d</p><p>I feel something jolt up my spine. An old circuit-breaker long since forgotten being tested out and sparking in the darkness.</p><p>Gretchen must see my expression, because she starts telling me about how this isn\u2019t just any Shakespeare class, how Professor Glenny has very strong opinions on how Shakespeare should be taught, and how he has a cult following on campus. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I can\u2019t help but think of him. And then I think of the tabula rasa. The resolution I made on New Year\u2019s. The fact that I am pre-med. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to take this class.\u201d</p><p>This makes her smile. \u201cSometimes the best way to find out what you\u2019re supposed to do is by doing the thing you\u2019re not supposed to do.\u201d She taps on her keyboard. \u201cIt\u2019s full, as usual, so you\u2019ll have to fight your way in off the wait list. Why not give it a shot? Leave it up to the fates.\u201d</p><p>The fates. I think that\u2019s another word for accidents.</p><p>Which I don\u2019t believe in anymore.</p> <p>But I let her register me for the class just the same.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>Stepping into the classroom for Shakespeare Out Loud is like stepping into an entirely different school than the one I\u2019ve attended for the past four months. Instead of a giant lecture hall, which is where all my science courses were located, or even a large classroom like Mandarin, it\u2019s in a tiny, intimate classroom, the kind we had in high school. There are maybe twenty-five desks arced into a U, around a lectern in the middle. And the students sitting at them, they look different too. Lip rings and hair dyed colors not found naturally on the human head. It\u2019s a sea of well-manicured alienation. The arty crowd, I guess. When I come in and look for a seat\u2014they\u2019re all taken\u2014no one looks at me.</p><p>I take a seat on the floor, near the door, for an easier escape. I may not belong in chemistry, but I don\u2019t belong here either. When Professor Glenny strides in five minutes late and looking like a rock star\u2014shaggy graying hair, beat-up leather boots, he even has pouty Mick Jagger lips\u2014he steps on me. As in, literally treads on my hand. As bad as my other classes have been, no one has ever stepped on me. Not an auspicious start, and I almost leave right then and there, but my way is now blocked by the overflow of other students.</p><p>\u201cShow of hands,\u201d Professor Glenny begins after he has dropped his artfully worn leather satchel on top of the lectern. \u201cHow many of you have ever read a Shakespeare play for the sheer pleasure of it?\u201d He has a British accent, though not the Masterpiece Theatre kind.</p> <p>About half the hands in the class shoot up. I almost consider raising mine, but it\u2019s just too much of a lie, and there\u2019s no point in brown-nosing if I\u2019m not staying.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Ancillary question: How many of you have fallen asleep while attempting to read a Shakespeare play by yourself?\u201d</p><p>The class goes silent. No hands go up. Then Professor Glenny looks right at me, and I\u2019m wondering how he knows, but then I realize he\u2019s not looking at me but the guy behind me, who is the only person who\u2019s raised a hand. Along with everyone else in the class, I turn and stare at him. He\u2019s one of two African American students in the room, though he\u2019s the only one sporting a huge halo of an afro covered in bejeweled barrettes, and bubble-gum-pink gloss on his lips. Otherwise, he\u2019s dressed like a soccer mom, in sweats and pink Uggs. In a field of carefully cultivated weirdness, he\u2019s a wildflower, or maybe a weed.</p><p>\u201cWhich play bored you to sleep?\u201d Professor Glenny asks.</p><p>\u201cTake your pick. Hamlet. Macbeth. Othello. I napped to the best of them.\u201d</p><p>The class titters, as if falling asleep while studying is so d\u00e9class\u00e9.</p> <p>Professor Glenny nods. \u201cSo why, then, please\u2014sorry, your name . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cD\u2019Angelo Harrison, but my friends call me Dee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be presumptuous and call you Dee. Dee, why take this class? Unless you\u2019re here to catch up on your sleep.\u201d</p><p>Again, the class laughs.</p><p>\u201cBy my count, this class costs about five grand a semester,\u201d Dee says. \u201cI can sleep for free.\u201d</p><p>I attempt the math. Is that how much one class costs?</p><p>\u201cQuite prudent,\u201d Professor Glenny says. \u201cSo, again, why take this class, given the expenditure and given Shakespeare\u2019s soporific track record?</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not actually in the class yet. I\u2019m on your wait list.\u201d</p> <p>At this point, I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s stalling or parrying with the professor, but either way, I\u2019m impressed. Everyone else here seems eager to give the right answer, and this guy is stringing the professor along. To his credit, Professor Glenny seems more amused than annoyed.</p><p>\u201cMy point is, Dee, why attempt it even?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a long pause. You can hear the fluorescent lights humming, the throat-clearing of a few students who clearly have a ready answer. And then Dee says, \u201cBecause the movie of Romeo and Juliet makes me cry harder than just about anything else. Every damn time I see it.\u201d</p><p>Again, the class laughs. It\u2019s not a kind laugh. Professor Glenny turns back toward the lectern and pulls a paper and pen out of his satchel. It\u2019s a list. He stares at it ominously and then checks off a name\u2014and I wonder if this Dee just got himself kicked off the wait list. What kind of class did Gretchen Price put me in? Gladiator Shakespeare?</p><p>Then Professor Glenny turns to a girl with weird pink Tootsie Roll twists who has her nose in a copy of the collected works of Shakespeare, the kind of girl who probably never deigned to watch Leo and Claire\u2019s version of Romeo and Juliet or fall asleep while reading Macbeth. He looms over her for a moment. She looks up at him and smiles bashfully, like, oh-you-caught-me-reading-my-book. He flashes a thousand-watt smile back at her. And then he slams her book shut. It\u2019s a big book. It makes a loud noise.</p><p>Professor Glenny returns to the lectern. \u201cShakespeare is a mysterious character. There is so much written about this man about whom we truly know so little. Sometimes I think only Jesus has had more ink spilled with less fruitful result. So I resist making any characterizations about the man. But I will go out on a limb and say this: Shakespeare did not write his plays so that you could sit in in a library carrel and read them in silence.\u201d He pauses, lets that sink in before continuing. \u201cPlaywrights are not novelists. They create works that need to be performed, interpreted. To be reinterpreted through the ages. It is credit to Shakespeare\u2019s genius that he gave us such great raw material that really could survive the ages, withstand the myriad reinterpretations we throw at it. But to truly appreciate Shakespeare, to understand why he has endured, you must hear it out loud, or better yet, see it performed, whether you see it performed in period costume or done naked, a dubious pleasure I\u2019ve had. Though a good film production can do the trick, as our friend Dee has so aptly demonstrated. And Mr. Harrison,\u201d he looks at Dee again. \u201cThank you for your honesty. I too have fallen asleep while reading Shakespeare. My college textbook still bears some drool marks. You\u2019re off the wait list.\u201d</p><p>Striding back to the whiteboard, Professor Glenny scrawls English 317\u2014Shakespeare Out Loud on it. \u201cThe name of this class is not accidental. It is quite literal. For in this class, we do not read Shakespeare quietly to ourselves or in the privacy of our bedrooms or libraries. We perform it. We see it performed. We read it aloud, in class or with partners. Every last one of us will become actors in this class, interpreters for one another, in front of one another. For those of you not prepared for this or who prefer a more conventional approach, this fine institution offers plenty of Shakespeare survey courses, and I suggest you avail yourself of one of them.\u201d</p><p>He pauses, as if to give people a chance to escape. Here would be my chance to go, but something roots me in place.</p><p>\u201cIf you know anything about this class, it\u2019s that I coordinate our readings to go with whatever Shakespeare is being performed during the term, be it by a community group or professional theater company. I expect attendance at all the plays, and I get us excellent group rates. As it happens, this winter and spring bring a delightful selection of plays.\u201d</p><p>He starts handing out the syllabus, and before one gets to me, before he finishes writing the order of plays on the board, I know it will be among them, even though Shakespeare wrote more than thirty plays, I know this one will be on our list.</p><p>It\u2019s midway through the syllabus, after Henry V and The Winter\u2019s Tale and before As You Like It and Cymbeline and Measure for Measure. But there on the page, it seems to jump out at me like a billboard. Twelfth Night. And whether I want to take this class or not is irrelevant. I can\u2019t stand up here and read those lines. That is the opposite of tabula rasa.</p><p>Professor Glenny goes on for a while about the plays, pointing to them one by one with his hand, erasing the ink in his enthusiasm. \u201cMy absolute favorite thing about this class is that we, in effect, let the themes choose us by letting the plays choose us. The dean was skeptical at first of this academia via serendipity, but it always seems to work out. Take this sampling.\u201d He points to the list of plays again. \u201cCan anyone surmise this semester\u2019s theme based on these particular plays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all comedies?\u201d the girl up front with the Tootsie Roll twists asks.</p><p>\u201cGood guess. The Winter\u2019s Tale, Measure for Measure, and Cymbeline, though all have much humor, are not considered comedies so much as problem plays, a category we shall discuss later. And Henry V, though it has many funny bits, is quite a serious play. Any other takers?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a hint. It\u2019s most obvious in Twelfth Night or As You Like It, which are comedies\u2014which isn\u2019t to say they\u2019re not also quite moving plays.\u201d</p><p>More silence.</p><p>\u201cCome now. Some of you fine scholars must have seen one of these. Who here has seen As You Like It or Twelfth Night?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t realize I\u2019ve raised my hand until it\u2019s too late. Until Professor Glenny has seen me and nodded to me with those bright, curious eyes of his. I want to say that I\u2019ve made a mistake, that it was some other version of Allyson who used to raise her hand in class who temporarily reappeared. But I can\u2019t, so I blurt out that I saw Twelfth Night over the summer.</p><p>Professor Glenny stands there, as if waiting for me to finish my thought. But that was it; that\u2019s all I have to say. There\u2019s an awkward silence, like I just announced I was an alcoholic\u2014at a Daughters of the American Revolution meeting.</p><p>But Professor Glenny refuses to give up on me: \u201cAnd, what was the main source of tension and humor in that particular play?\u201d</p><p>For the briefest of seconds, I\u2019m not in this overheated classroom on a winter\u2019s morning. It\u2019s the hot English night, and I\u2019m at the canal basin in Stratford-upon-Avon. And then I\u2019m in a Paris park. And then I\u2019m back here. In all three places, the answer remains the same: \u201cNo one is who they pretend to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllyson,\u201d I finish. \u201cAllyson Healey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllyson. Perhaps a slight overgeneralization, but for our purposes, it hits the nail right on the head.\u201d He turns to the board and scrawls Altering Identity, Altering Reality on it. Then he checks something else off on his sheet of paper.</p><p>Professor Glenny continues, \u201cNow, before we part ways, one last piece of housekeeping. We won\u2019t have time to read each play completely in class, though we will make quite a dent. I believe I\u2019ve made my point about reading alone to yourselves, so I\u2019d like you to read the remaining sections aloud with partners. This is not optional. Please pair up now. If you\u2019re on the wait list, find a partner also on the wait list. Allyson, you\u2019re no longer on the wait list. As you can see, class participation is rewarded in here.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s bustle as everyone pairs off. I look around. Next to me is a normalish-girl with cat-eye glasses. I could ask her.</p><p>Or I could get up and walk out of the class. Even though I\u2019m off the wait list, I could just drop the class, leave my spot for someone else.</p><p>But for some reason, I don\u2019t do either of those things. I turn away from the girl in the glasses and look behind me. That guy, Dee, is sitting there, like the unpopular and unathletic kid who always wound up the remainder during team picking for grade-school kickball games. He\u2019s wearing a bemused look, as if he knows no one will ask him and he\u2019s saving everyone the trouble. So when I ask him if he wants to be partners, his arch expression falls away for a moment and he appears genuinely surprised. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust so happens my dance card is none too full at the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a yes?\u201d</p><p>He nods.</p><p>\u201cGood. I do have one condition. It\u2019s more of a favor. Two favors, actually.\u201d</p> <p>He frowns for a moment, then arches his plucked eyebrow so high, it disappears into the halo of hair.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to read Twelfth Night out loud. You can do all the parts, if you want, and I\u2019ll listen, and then I\u2019ll read one of the other plays. Or we can rent a movie version and read along. I just don\u2019t want to have to say it. Not a word of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you gonna get away with that in class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you got against Twelfth Night?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the other thing. I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>He sighs as if considering. \u201cAre you a flake or a diva? Diva I can work with, but I got no time for flakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m either.\u201d Dee looks skeptical. \u201cIt\u2019s just that one play, I swear. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a DVD for it.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me for a long minute, as if trying to X-ray my true self. Then he either decides I\u2019m okay or recognizes he has no other options, because he rolls his eyes and sighs loudly. \u201cThere are several versions of Twelfth Night, actually.\u201d Suddenly, his voice and diction have completely changed. Even his expression has gone professorial. \u201cThere\u2019s a film version with Helena Bonham Carter, who is magnificent. But if we\u2019re going to cheat like this, we should rent the stage version.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him a moment, baffled. He stares back, then his mouth cracks into the smallest of grins. And I realize what I said before was right: No one is who they pretend to be.</p><p>Twenty-one</p> <p>FEBRUARY</p><p>College</p><p>For the first few weeks of class, Dee and I tried meeting in the library, but we got dirty looks, especially when Dee broke out into his voices. And he has lots of voices: a solemn En-glish accent when doing Henry, a weird Irish brogue\u2014his take on a Welsh accent, I guess\u2014as Fluellen, exaggerated French accents when doing the French characters. I don\u2019t bother with accents. It\u2019s enough for me to get the words right.</p><p>After getting shushed in the library one too many times, we switched to the Student Union, but Dee couldn\u2019t hear me over the din. He projected so well, you\u2019d think he was a theater major or something. But I think he\u2019s history or political science. Not that he\u2019s told me this; we don\u2019t talk aside from the reading. But I\u2019ve glimpsed his textbooks, and they\u2019re all tomes about the history of the labor movement or treatises on government.</p><p>So right before we start reading the second play, The Winter\u2019s Tale, I suggest that we move to my dorm, where it\u2019s generally quiet in the afternoons. Dee gives me a long look and then says okay. I tell him to come over at four.</p><p>That afternoon, I lay out a plate of the cookies that Grandma keeps sending me, and I make tea. I have no idea what Dee expects, but this is the first time I\u2019ve ever entertained in my room, though I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m doing qualifies as entertaining or if Dee is company.</p><p>But when Dee sees the cookies, he gives me a funny little smile. Then he takes off his coat and hangs it in the closet, even though mine is tossed over a chair. He kicks off his boots. Then he looks around my room.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a clock?\u201d he asks. \u201cMy phone\u2019s dead.\u201d</p> <p>I get up and show him the box of alarm clocks, which I have since put back in the closet. \u201cTake your pick.\u201d</p><p>He takes a long time choosing, finally settling on a 1940s mahogany deco number. I show him how to wind it. He asks how to set the alarm. I show him. Then he sets it for five fifty, explaining he has to be at his job at the dining hall at six. The reading usually doesn\u2019t take more than a half hour, so I\u2019m not sure why he sets the alarm. But I don\u2019t say anything. About that. Or about his job, even though I\u2019m curious about it.</p><p>He sits down on my desk chair. I sit on my bed. He picks up a tube of fruit flies from the desk, examining it with a slightly amused expression. \u201cThey\u2019re Drosophila,\u201d I explain. \u201cI\u2019m breeding them for a class.\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cIf you run out, you can come get more in my mama\u2019s kitchen.\u201d</p><p>I want to ask him where that kitchen is. Where he\u2019s from. But he seems guarded. Or maybe it\u2019s me. Maybe making friends is a specific skill, and I missed the lesson. \u201cOkay, time for work. See you later, my dropsillas,\u201d he says to the bugs. I don\u2019t correct his pronunciation.</p><p>We read a really good scene at the beginning of The Winter\u2019s Tale, when Leontes freaks out and thinks that Hermione is cheating on him. When we get to the end point, Dee packs up his Shakespeare textbook, and I think he\u2019s going to leave, but instead he pulls out a book by someone called Marcuse. He gives me the quickest of looks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make more tea,\u201d I say.</p><p>We study together in silence. It\u2019s nice. At five fifty, the alarm goes off and Dee packs up to go to work.</p><p>\u201cWednesday?\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Two days later, we go through the same routine, cookies, tea, hello to the \u201cdropsillas,\u201d Shakespeare out loud, and silent study. We don\u2019t talk. We just work. On Friday, Kali comes into the room. It\u2019s the first time she\u2019s seen Dee, seen anyone, in the room with me, and she looks at him for a long moment. I introduce them.</p><p>\u201cHi, Dee. Pleasure to meet you,\u201d she says in a strangely flirty voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, the pleasure is all mine,\u201d Dee says, his voice all exaggeratedly animated.</p><p>Kali looks at him and then smiles. Then she goes to her closet and pulls out a camel coat and a pair of tawny suede boots. \u201cDee, can I ask you something? What do you think of these boots with this jacket? Too matchy matchy?\u201d</p><p>I look at Dee. He is wearing sky-blue sweats and a T-shirt with sparkly lettering spelling out I BELIEVE. I\u2019m not clear how this reads Fashion Expert to Kali.</p><p>But Dee gets right into it. \u201cOh, girl, those boots are fine. I might have to take them from you.\u201d</p><p>I look at him, sort of shocked. I mean I figured Dee was g*y, but I\u2019ve never heard him talk all sassy-gay-sidekick before.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you won\u2019t,\u201d Kali replies, her strange ways of KO\u2019ing words now blending with some latent Valley Girl tendencies. \u201cThey cost me, like, four hundred dollars. You can borrow them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re a doll baby. But you got Cinderella feet, and ole Dee\u2019s like one of them ugly stepsisters.\u201d</p><p>Kali laughs, and they go on like this for some time, talking about fashion. I feel kind of bad. I guess I never realized Dee was so into this kind of thing. Kali got it right away. It\u2019s like she has some radar, the one that tells you how to pick up on things with people, how to be friends. I don\u2019t really care about fashion, but that night, when the alarm goes off and Dee packs up to leave, I show him the latest skirt my mom sent me and ask if he thinks it\u2019s too preppy. But he barely gives it half a glance. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>After that, Kali starts showing up more often, and she and Dee go all Project Runway, and Dee always switches into that voice. I write it off as just a fashion thing. But then a few days after that, as we\u2019re leaving, Kendra walks in, and I introduce them. Kendra sizes Dee up, like she does with people, and puts on her flight-attendant smile and asks Dee where he\u2019s from.</p><p>\u201cNew York,\u201d he says. I make a note of that. I\u2019ve known him for almost three weeks, and I\u2019m just now finding out the basics.</p><p>\u201cWhere in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Bronx.\u201d</p><p>The flight attendant smile is gone, replaced by a tight line that looks penciled on.</p><p>\u201cOh, like the South Bronx? Well. You must be so glad to be living here.\u201d</p><p>Now it\u2019s Dee who gives Kendra the once-over. They\u2019re eyeing each other like dogs, and I wonder if it\u2019s because they\u2019re both black. Then, he switches to a different voice from the one he talks to Kali or me in. \u201cYou from the South Bronx?\u201d</p><p>Kendra recoils a little. \u201cNo! I\u2019m from Washington.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike where they got all the rain and shit?\u201d</p><p>Rain and shit?</p><p>\u201cNo, not state. DC.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I got some cousins in DC. Down in Anacostia. Shit, those are some nasty-ass projects. Even worse than where I came up. There\u2019s a shooting at their school every damn week.\u201d</p><p>Kendra looks horrified. \u201cI\u2019ve never even been to Anacostia. I live in Georgetown. And I went to Sidwell Friends, where the Obama girls go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to South Bronx High. Most wack school in America. Ever heard of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid I haven\u2019t.\u201d She gives me a quick look. \u201cWell, I have to go. I\u2019m meeting Jeb soon.\u201d Jeb is her new boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cCatch you later, homegirl,\u201d Dee calls as Kendra disappears into her room. As Dee picks up his backpack to leave, he is quaking with laughter.</p><p>I decide to walk him to the dining hall, maybe eat there for a change. Eating alone sucks, but there are only so many microwave burritos a girl can stomach. When we get downstairs, I ask him if he really went to South Bronx High School.</p><p>When he speaks again, he sounds like Dee. Or the Dee I know. \u201cThey closed South Bronx High School a year ago, not that I ever went there. I went to a charter school. Then I got snagged in Prep for Prep\u2014scholarship thing\u2014by a private school that\u2019s even more expensive than Sidwell Friends. Take that, Miss Thang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just tell her where you went?\u201d</p><p>He looks at me and then, reverting to the voice he\u2019d used with Kendra, says, \u201cIf homegirls wanna see me as ghetto trash\u201d\u2014he stops and switches to his lispy, sassy voice\u2014\u201cor big-ass queer\u201d\u2014now he switches to his deepest Shakespeare voice\u2014\u201cI shall not take it upon myself to disabuse them.\u201d</p><p>When we reach the dining hall, I feel like I should say something to him. But I\u2019m not sure what. In the end, I just ask him if he wants chocolate chip or butter cookies next time. Grandma sent me both.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll supply cookies. My mama sent up some homemade molasses spice ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 nice about it. She\u2019s throwing down. She wasn\u2019t about to be outdone by somebody\u2019s grandma.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. It\u2019s a strange sound, like an old car being started after a long time in the garage. \u201cWe won\u2019t tell my grandma that. If she accepts the challenge and bakes her own cookies, we might get food poisoning. She\u2019s the worst cook in the world.\u201d</p><p>It becomes a routine then. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday: cookies, tea, alarm clock, Shakespeare, study. We still don\u2019t talk much about ourselves, but little things slip through the cracks. His mother works at a hospital. He has no siblings, but five zillion cousins. He\u2019s on a full scholarship. He has a rather huge crush on Professor Glenny. He is double-majoring in history and literature, and maybe a minor in political science. He hums when he\u2019s bored, and when he\u2019s really into his reading, he twists his hair around his index finger so tight, it turns pink. And just as I suspected from that first day in class, he\u2019s smart. That he doesn\u2019t tell me, but it\u2019s obvious. He\u2019s the only one in the entire class to get an A on Glenny\u2019s first assignment, a paper on Henry V; Professor Glenny announces it to the class and reads snippets of Dee\u2019s paper to the class as an example of what the rest of us should strive for. Dee looks mortified, and I feel sort of bad, but the Glenny groupies regard Dee with such looks of naked envy that it\u2019s almost worth it. I, meanwhile, get a very solid B on my paper about Perdita and themes of lost and found.</p><p>I tell Dee little things about me too, but half the time, I find myself censoring what I want to say. I like him. I do. But I\u2019m trying to make good on my tabula-rasa promise. Still, I sort of wish I could ask Dee\u2019s opinion about Melanie. I sent her the very first piece I made from ceramics class, along with a note about how I\u2019d completely upended my schedule. I sent it Priority Mail, and then a week went by, and I didn\u2019t hear anything. So I\u2019d called her up to make sure she\u2019d gotten it\u2014it was just a crappy, handmade bowl, but it had a beautiful crackly turquoise glaze\u2014and she apologized for not responding, saying she was busy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I told her all about my new classes, and about the crazy lengths I was going to so my parents wouldn\u2019t find out: sending them biology tests with improving scores (Dee\u2019s and my lengthy study sessions are paying off) but also sending them my old chemistry lab partner\u2019s tests, with my name on them. I figured she\u2019d get a good laugh about this, but instead her voice had stayed flat, and she\u2019d warned me about the kind of trouble I\u2019d be in if I got caught\u2014as if I didn\u2019t already know that. Then I\u2019d switched gears, telling her all about Professor Glenny and Dee and reading out loud and how mortifying I\u2019d thought it would be to read in front of the class but how everyone does it and it isn\u2019t so bad. I\u2019d expected her to be excited for me, but her voice had been practically monotone, and I\u2019d found myself getting so angry. We haven\u2019t talked or emailed in a couple of weeks, and I\u2019m both upset about it and relieved too.</p><p>I\u2019d kind of like to tell Dee about this, but I\u2019m not sure how to do it. Aside from Melanie, I\u2019ve never had a really close friend, and I\u2019m unclear how you make one. It\u2019s silly, I know. I\u2019ve seen other people do it. They make it seem so easy: Have fun, open up, share stories. But how am I supposed to do that when the one story I really want to tell is the very one I\u2019m supposed to be wiping clean? And besides, the last time I did open up to somebody . . . well, that\u2019s precisely why I\u2019m in need of a tabula rasa in the first place. It just seems safer to keep it like it is\u2014friendly, cordial, nice and simple.</p><p>At the end of February, my parents come up for Presidents\u2019 Weekend. It\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve been up since Parents\u2019 Weekend, and having learned my lesson, I go to elaborate lengths to keep up the image they expect of me. I put my clocks back out. I highlight pages in my unused chemistry textbook and copy labs out of my old lab partners\u2019 book. I make us lots of plans in Boston to keep us off campus, away from incriminating evidence and the Terrific Trio (who now have become more of a Dynamic Duo anyway because Kendra\u2019s always with her boyfriend). And I tell Dee, with whom I now study on weekends sometimes, that I won\u2019t be around and that I can\u2019t get together Friday and Monday.</p><p>\u201cYou throwing me over for Drew?\u201d Drew is the second best Shakespeare reader in the class.</p> <p>\u201cNo. Of course not,\u201d I reply, my voice all pinched and panicked. \u201cIt\u2019s just I have one of those trips with my ceramics class Friday.\u201d This isn\u2019t entirely untrue. My ceramics class does go on field trips occasionally. We\u2019re experimenting with glazes, using different kinds of organic materials in the kiln, and sometimes even firing our pottery outside in earthen furnaces we build. I do have field trips, just not in the next couple of days.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll probably work on a paper this weekend.\u201d Another lie; the only class I have papers for is Shakespeare. It\u2019s amazing how good at lying I\u2019ve become. \u201cI\u2019ll see you Wednesday, okay? I\u2019ll bring the cookies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell your grandma to send some more of those twisty ones with the poppy seeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRugelach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say it. I just eat it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell her.\u201d</p><p>The weekend with my parents goes decently enough. We go to the Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Science. We go ice skating (I can\u2019t keep my blades straight). We go to the movies. We take tons of pictures. There\u2019s an awkward moment or two when Mom pulls out next year\u2019s course catalog and starts going over class schedules with me and then asks me about my summer plans, but I just listen to her suggestions like I always have and don\u2019t say anything. By the end of the weekend, I feel drained in the same way that I do after a marathon session of reading Shakespeare aloud and trying to be all those different people.</p><p>On Sunday afternoon, we\u2019re back at my dorm before dinner when Dee pops by. And though I haven\u2019t told him one single thing about my family, not even that they were coming, let alone what they believe about me, what they expect of me, he still shows up in a pair of plain jeans and a sweater, something I\u2019ve never seen him wear before. His hair is pulled back into a cap and he\u2019s not wearing lip gloss. I almost don\u2019t recognize him.</p><p>\u201cSo, how do you two know each other?\u201d Mom asks after I nervously introduce them.</p><p>I freeze, in a panic.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re biology lab partners,\u201d Dee says, not missing a beat. \u201cWe\u2019re raising the Drosophila together.\u201d It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever heard him pronounce it correctly. He picks up the tube. \u201cBreeding all kinds of genetic abnormalities here.\u201d</p> <p>My dad laughs. \u201cThey had us do the same experiment when I went here too.\u201d He looks at Dee. \u201cAre you pre-med also?\u201d</p><p>Dee\u2019s eyebrows flicker up, the slightest ripple of surprise. \u201cI\u2019m still undeclared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no rush,\u201d Mom says. Which almost makes me laugh out loud.</p><p>Dad turns to puts the tube back next to a cylinder of pottery I forgot to hide away. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I made that,\u201d Dee says, picking up the piece. And then he starts explaining how he\u2019s taking a pottery class, and this year\u2019s class is experimenting with different kinds of glazes and firing methods, and for these pieces, they fired everything in an earthen kiln fueled by cow patties.</p><p>\u201cCow patties?\u201d Mom asks. \u201cAs in . . . feces?\u201d</p><p>Dee nods. \u201cYes, we went to local farms and asked if we could collect their cow manure. They actually don\u2019t smell that bad. They\u2019re grass-fed cows.\u201d</p><p>And it hits me then that Dee is using another voice, but this time, the person he\u2019s playing is me. I had told him all about the cow patties, the earthy smell, collecting them from the farms . . . though when I\u2019d done it, he\u2019d laughed his head off at the thought of all us rich kids at our forty-thousand-dollar-a-year school paying for a class in which we went to farms and picked up after cows. I\u2019ve told Dee more about myself than I guess I realized. And he listened. He paid attention, absorbed a bit of me. And now he\u2019s saving my ass with it.</p> <p>\u201cCow feces. How fascinating,\u201d my mother tells him.</p><p>The next day, my parents leave, and on Wednesday, our Shakespeare class starts on Twelfth Night. Dee has checked out two different versions from the media center for us to watch. He feels that as penance for not doing our homework, we should at least watch several. He hands me the stage version as I fire up my laptop.</p><p>\u201cThank you for getting these,\u201d I say. \u201cI would have done it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was at the media center anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thank you. Also, thank you for how completely awesome you were with my parents.\u201d I pause for a second, more than a little embarrassed. \u201cHow\u2019d you know they were coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy girlfriend Kali. She tell me. She tell me everything, because we be besties.\u201d He narrows his eyes. \u201cSee? Wasn\u2019t no need to hide Miss Dee from the folks. I clean up real nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>Dee stares at me, waiting for more.</p><p>\u201cReally. It\u2019s just my parents. There\u2019s a lot . . . well, it\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t so complicated. I gets it just fine. Okay to slum with Dee but not to bring out the good silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You\u2019ve got it wrong!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cI\u2019m not slumming. I really like you.\u201d</p><p>He crosses his arms and stares at me. \u201cHow was your field trip?\u201d he asks acidly.</p><p>I want to explain, I do. But how? How do I do that without giving myself away? Because I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m trying to be a new person here, a different person, a tabula rasa. But if I explain about my parents, about Melanie, about Willem, if I show who I really am, then aren\u2019t I just stuck back where I started?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I lied. But I swear, it\u2019s not about you. I can\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate what you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t no thang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I really mean it. You were great. My parents loved you. And you were so smooth, about everything. They didn\u2019t suspect a thing.\u201d</p><p>He whips the lip gloss out of his pocket and, with painstaking precision, applies it first to his top lip, then his bottom. Then he smacks them together, noisily like some kind of rebuke. \u201cWhat\u2019s to suspect? I don\u2019t know nothin\u2019 \u2019bout nobody. I just be the help.\u201d</p><p>I want to make it right. For him to know that I care about him. That I\u2019m not ashamed of him. That he is safe with me. \u201cYou know,\u201d I begin, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to do that with me. The voices. You can just be yourself.\u201d</p><p>I mean it as a compliment, so he\u2019ll know that I like him as is. But he doesn\u2019t take it that way. He purses his lips and shakes his head. \u201cThis is myself, baby. All of my selves. I own each and every one of them. I know who I\u2019m pretending to be and who I am.\u201d The look he gives me is withering. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>I purposely tried to keep all of that from him, but Dee\u2014smart, sharp Dee\u2014he got it. All of it. He knows what a big fat fake I am. I\u2019m so ashamed I don\u2019t even know what to say. After a while, he slips Twelfth Night into my computer. We watch the entire thing in silence, no voices, no commentary, no laughing, just four eyeballs staring at a screen. And that\u2019s how I know I\u2019ve blown it with Dee.</p><p>I\u2019m so miserable about this that I forget to be upset about Willem.</p><p>Twenty-two</p><p>MARCH</p><p>College</p><p>The winter drags on, no matter what the groundhog says. Dee stops coming over in the afternoons, ostensibly because we\u2019re not reading Twelfth Night aloud, but I know that\u2019s not really it. The cookies from my grandmother pile up. I get a bad cold, which I can\u2019t seem to shake, though it does have the side benefit of getting me out of reading any of Twelfth Night in front of the class. Professor Glenny, who is stuffy himself, gives me a packet of something called Lemsips and tells me to get in shape so I can pull a double shift as Rosalind in As You Like It, one of his favorite plays.</p><p>We finish Twelfth Night. I thought I\u2019d feel relieved, as if I\u2019d dodged a bullet. But I don\u2019t. With Dee out of my life, I feel like I took the bullet, even without reading the play. Tabula rasa was the right move. Taking this class was the wrong move. Now I just have to buckle through. I\u2019m getting used to that.</p><p>We move on to As You Like It. In his introductory spiel, Professor Glenny goes on about how this is one of Shakespeare\u2019s most romantic plays, his sexiest, and this gets all the Glenny groupies up front swooning. I take vacant notes as he outlines the plot: A deposed duke\u2019s daughter named Rosalind and a gentleman named Orlando meet and fall in love at first sight. But then Rosalind\u2019s uncle kicks her out of his house, and she flees with her cousin Celia to the Forest of Arden. There, Rosalind takes on the identity of a boy named Ganymede. Orlando, who has also fled to Arden, meets Ganymede, and the two strike up a friendship. Rosalind as Ganymede uses her disguise and their friendship to test Orlando\u2019s proclaimed love for Rosalind. Meanwhile, all sorts of people take on different identities and fall in love. As always, Professor Glenny tells us to pay attention to specific themes and passages, specifically how emboldened Rosalind becomes when she is Ganymede and how that alters both her and the courtship with Orlando. It kind of all sounds like a sitcom, and I have to work hard to keep it straight.</p><p>Dee and I start reading together again, but now we\u2019re back in the Student Union, and he packs up as soon as we finish our assignment. He\u2019s stopped doing all the crazy voices, which makes me realize just how helpful they were in \u201cinterpreting\u201d the plays because now, with both of us reading in monotones, the words sort of drift over me like a foreign language. We may as well be reading it to ourselves for how boring it has become. The only time Dee uses his voices now is when he has to speak to me. I get a different voice, or two, or three, every day. The message is clear: I\u2019ve been demoted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I want to undo this. To make it right. But I have no idea how. I don\u2019t seem to know how to open up to people without getting the door slammed in my face. So I do nothing.</p><p>\u201cToday we will read one of my favorite scenes in As You Like It, the beginning of act four,\u201d Professor Glenny says, one bone-chillingly cold March day that makes it seem like we\u2019re heading into winter, not out of it. \u201cOrlando and Ganymede/Rosalind are meeting again in the Forest of Arden, and the chemistry between them reaches its boiling point. Which is kind of confusing and amusing, given that Orlando believes himself to be speaking to Ganymede, who is male. But it\u2019s equally confusing for Rosalind, who is in a kind of delicious torment, torn between two identities, the male and the female, and two desires: a desire to protect herself and remain Orlando\u2019s equal, and the exquisite desire to simply submit.\u201d Up in the front of the classroom, the groupies seem to emit a little joint sigh. If Dee and I were still friends, it would be the kind of thing that would make us look at each other and roll our eyes. But we\u2019re not, so I don\u2019t even look at him.</p><p>\u201cSo, Orlando comes to Ganymede in the forest, and the two perform a sort of Kabuki theater together, and in doing so, they fall deeper in love, even as they don\u2019t entirely know whom they\u2019re falling in love with,\u201d Professor Glenny continues. \u201cThe line between true self and feigned self is blurred on all sides. Which I think is a rather handy metaphor for falling in love. So, it\u2019s a good day to read. Who\u2019s up?\u201d He scans the class. People are actually raising their hands. \u201cDrew, why don\u2019t you read Orlando.\u201d There\u2019s a smattering of applause as Drew walks up the front of the room. He\u2019s one of the best readers in the class. Normally, Professor Glenny pairs him with Nell or Kaitlin, two of the best girls. But not today. \u201cAllyson, I believe you owe me a Rosalind.\u201d</p><p>I shuffle up to the front of the room, along with the other readers he\u2019s chosen. I\u2019ve never loved this part of the class, but at least before, I could feel Dee cheering me on. Once we\u2019re assembled, Professor Glenny turns into a director, which apparently is what he used to do before becoming an academic. He offers us notes: \u201cDrew, in these scenes, Orlando is ardent and steadfast, completely in love. Allyson, your Ganymede is torn: smitten, but also toying with Orlando, like a cat with a mouse. What makes this scene so fascinating to me is that as Ganymede questions Orlando, challenges him to prove his love, you can feel the wall between Rosalind and Ganymede drop. I love that moment in Shakespeare\u2019s plays. When the identities and false identities become a morass of emotion. Both characters feel it here. It gets very charged. Let\u2019s see how you two do.\u201d</p> <p>The scene opens with Rosalind/Ganymede/me asking Orlando/Drew where he\u2019s been, why he\u2019s taken so long to come see me\u2014I\u2019m \u201cpretending\u201d to be Rosalind. That\u2019s the gimmick. Rosalind has been pretending to be Ganymede, who must now pretend to be Rosalind. And she tries to talk Orlando out of loving Rosalind, even though she really is Rosalind and even though she really does love him back. Trying to keep track of all the pretending makes my head spin.</p><p>Drew/Orlando replies that he came within an hour of his promised time. I say to be even an hour late when you\u2019ve made a promise in love\u2019s name puts in question whether you\u2019re truly in love. He begs my forgiveness. We banter a bit more, and then I, as Rosalind as Ganymede feigning Rosalind, ask, \u201cWhat would you say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?\u201d</p><p>Drew pauses, and I find that I\u2019m waiting, holding my breath, even, for his answer.</p><p>And then he replies, \u201cI would kiss before I spoke.\u201d</p><p>Drew\u2019s eyes are blue, nothing like his, but for a second, it\u2019s his dark eyes I see. Electric and charged, right before he kissed me.</p> <p>I\u2019m kind of rattled as I deliver my next lines, advising Orlando that he should speak before he kisses. We go back and forth, and when we get to the part when Orlando says he would marry me\u2014her\u2014I don\u2019t know about Rosalind, but I\u2019m feeling dizzy. Luckily, Rosalind has more grit than I do. She, as Ganymede, says, \u201cWell, in her person, I say I will not have you.\u201d</p><p>Then Drew says, \u201cThen in mine own person I die.\u201d</p><p>And then something in me just comes undone. I can\u2019t find the right line or the right page. And I seem to have lost something else too. My grip on myself, on this place. On time. I\u2019m not sure how much of it elapses while I stand there frozen. I hear Drew clear his throat, waiting for me to say my next line. I hear Professor Glenny shift in his chair. Drew whispers my line to me, and I repeat it and somehow manage to regain my bearings. I continue to question Orlando. Continue to ask him to prove his love. But I am no longer acting, no longer pretending.</p><p>\u201cNow tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her?\u201d I ask as Rosalind. My voice no longer sounds like mine. It is rich and resonant with emotion\u2014full of the questions I should\u2019ve asked back when I had the chance.</p><p>He answers, \u201cFor ever and a day.\u201d</p><p>All the breath whooshes out of me. This is the answer that I need. Even if it doesn\u2019t happen to be true.</p> <p>I try to read the next line, but I can\u2019t speak. I can\u2019t breathe. I hear a roar of wind in my ears and blink to stop the words from dancing all over the page. After a few moments, I manage to choke out the next sentence, \u201cSay \u2018a day\u2019 without the \u2018ever,\u2019\u201d before my voice breaks.</p><p>Because Rosalind understands. Say a day without the ever. That after the one day comes heartbreak. No wonder she won\u2019t tell him who she truly is.</p><p>I feel the hot tears in my eyes and through their veil see the class, silent, gaping at me. I drop my book to the floor and bolt toward the door. I run out into the hallway, past the classrooms, and into the ladies\u2019 room. Crouching in a corner stall, I gulp deep breaths and listen to the hum of the fluorescent lights, trying desperately to push back against this hollowness that threatens to swallow me alive.</p><p>I have a full life. How can I be this empty? Because of one guy? Because of one day? But as I hold back my tears, I see the days before Willem. I see myself with Melanie at school, feeling all cocooned and smug, gossiping about girls we didn\u2019t bother to get to know or, later on, on the tour, pantomiming a friendship sputtering on fumes. I see myself with my parents, at the dinner table, Mom with her ever-present calendar, scheduling dance class or SAT prep or some other enrichment activity, leafing through catalogs for a new pair of snow boots, talking at each other but not to each other. I see myself with Evan, after we slept together for the first time and he said something about how this meant we were the closest people to each other, and it had been a sweet thing to say, but it felt like something he\u2019d gotten out of a book. Or maybe it was that I hadn\u2019t felt it because I\u2019d begun to suspect that we\u2019d only gotten together because Melanie had started dating his best friend. When I\u2019d started to cry, Evan had mistaken my tears for joy, which had only made it worse. And, yet, I\u2019d stayed with him.</p><p>I have been empty for a long time. Long before Willem entered and exited my life so abruptly.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure how long I\u2019m in there before I hear the squeak of the door. Then I see Dee\u2019s pink Ugg knockoffs under the stall.</p><p>\u201cYou in here?\u201d he asks quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d</p><p>I unlock the stall. There\u2019s Dee, holding all my stuff.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d I tell him.</p><p>\u201cSorry? You were stupendous. You got a standing ovation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you my parents were coming. I\u2019m sorry I lied to you. I\u2019m sorry I bungled everything. I don\u2019t know how to be a friend. I don\u2019t know how to be anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how to be Rosalind,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m an expert faker.\u201d I swipe a tear with my hand. \u201cI\u2019m so good at faking I don\u2019t even know when I\u2019m doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, have you learned nothing from these plays? Ain\u2019t such a line between faking and being.\u201d He opens his arms, and I step into them. \u201cI\u2019m sorry too,\u201d he says. \u201cI might\u2019ve overreacted a hair. I can be dramatic, in case you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Dee holds my coat, and I slip into it. \u201cI don\u2019t like being lied to, but I do appreciate what you tried to say to me. People have never known what to make of me\u2014not in my neighborhood, not at high school, not here\u2014so they\u2019re always trying to figure it out and tell me what I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know something about that.\u201d</p><p>We look at each other for a long minute. A whole lot gets said in that silence. Then Dee asks, \u201cYou wanna tell me what all that was about in there?\u201d</p><p>And I do. So much it\u2019s squeezing my chest. I\u2019ve been wanting to tell him this, everything about me, for weeks now. I nod.</p><p>Dee offers me his arm, and I loop mine through it, and we leave the bathroom as a pair of girls come in, giving us a strange look.</p><p>\u201cWell, there was this guy . . .\u201d I begin.</p><p>He shakes his head and gently clucks his tongue like a sweetly scolding grandmother. \u201cThere always is.\u201d</p><p>I take Dee back to my dorm. I serve him a backlog of cookies. And I tell him everything. When I finish, we\u2019ve munched our way through black-and-whites and peanut butter. He wipes the crumbs off his lap and asks me if I ever thought about Romeo and Juliet.</p><p>\u201cNot everything tracks back to Shakespeare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes it does. Did you ever think what might\u2019ve happened if they weren\u2019t so damn impatient? If maybe Romeo had stopped for a second and gotten a doctor, or waited for Juliet to wake up? Not jumped to conclusions and gone and poisoned himself thinking she was dead when she was just sleeping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see you have.\u201d And I can. He\u2019s pretty worked up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen that movie so many times, and every damn time, it\u2019s like screaming at the girl in the horror movie. Stop. Don\u2019t go in the basement. The killer\u2019s down there. With Romeo and Juliet, I yell, \u2018Don\u2019t jump to conclusions.\u2019 But do those fools ever listen to me?\u201d He shakes his head in dismay. \u201cI always imagine what might\u2019ve happened if they\u2019d waited. Juliet would\u2019ve woken up. They\u2019d already be married. They might\u2019ve moved away, far away from the Montagues and the Capulets, gotten themselves a cute castle of their own. Decorated it up nice. Maybe it would\u2019ve been like The Winter\u2019s Tale. By thinking Hermione was dead, Leontes had time to stop acting like a fool and then later he was so happy to find out she was alive. Maybe the Montagues and Capulets would find out later that their beloved kids weren\u2019t dead, and wasn\u2019t it stupid to feud, and everyone would be happy. Maybe it would\u2019ve turned the whole tragedy into a comedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Winter\u2019s Tale isn\u2019t a comedy; it\u2019s a problem play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you hush up. You see where I\u2019m going with this.\u201d</p><p>And I do. And maybe I hadn\u2019t thought about this with Romeo and Juliet, but I had briefly gone to the what-if place with me and Willem. On the train back to England and then on the flight home, I\u2019d had second thoughts. What if something had happened to him? But both times, I\u2019d voiced my doubts\u2014first to Ms. Foley and then to Melanie\u2014and both times I\u2019d been set straight. Willem wasn\u2019t Romeo. He was a romeo. And I\u2019m no Juliet. I tell Dee this. I enumerate all the examples of him being a player, beginning with the fact that he picked up a random girl on a train and, an hour later, invited her to Paris for the day.</p><p>\u201cNormal people don\u2019t do that,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about normal? And maybe you weren\u2019t random. Maybe you were something to him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t even know me. I was someone else that day. I was Lulu. That\u2019s who he liked. And besides, let\u2019s pretend something did happen, he didn\u2019t ditch me. I only know his first name. He doesn\u2019t even know my name. He lives a continent away. He\u2019s irretrievably lost. How do you find someone like that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dee looks at me as if the answer is obvious. \u201cYou look.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-three</p><p>NAME: Willem</p><p>NATIONALITY: Dutch</p> <p>AGE: 20 as of last August</p><p>GREW UP IN AMSTERDAM.</p><p>PARENTS: Yael and Bram.

It takes up barely a third of a page in one of my abandoned lab notebooks. When I finish, the list is like a taunt, reality\u2019s bitchslap. You think you fell in love with someone, and this is what you know about him? Eight things? And how would I find him with these eight things? Forget looking for a needle in a haystack. That\u2019s easy. At least it would stand out. I\u2019m looking for one specific needle in a needle factory.</p><p>Eight things. It\u2019s humiliating. I stare at the page and am about to tear it out and crumple it up.</p><p>But instead, I turn the page and start writing a different list. Random things. Like the amused look on his face when I admitted I\u2019d thought he was a kidnapper. And the way he looked at the caf\u00e9 when he found out I was an only child and asked if I was alone. The goofy happiness as he bounded around the barge with Captain Jack. How good it felt to know that I was responsible for him looking that way. The way Paris sounded under the canal. The way it looked from the back of the bike. The way his hand felt in the crook of my hip. The fierceness in his eyes when he jumped up to help those girls in the park. The reassurance of his hand, grasping mine as we ran through the streets of Paris. The raw expression on his face at the dinner table when I\u2019d asked him why he\u2019d brought me there. And later, at the squat, how he looked at me and I felt so big and strong and capable and brave.</p><p>I let the memories flood me as I fill one page. Then another. And then I\u2019m not even writing about him anymore. I\u2019m writing about me. About all the things I felt that day, including panic and jealousy, but more about feeling like the world was full of nothing but possibility.</p><p>I fill three pages. None of what I\u2019m writing will help me find him. But in writing, I feel good\u2014no, not just good, but full. Right, somehow. It\u2019s a feeling I haven\u2019t experienced in a long, long time, and it\u2019s this more than anything that convinces me to look for him.</p><p>The most concrete thing on the list is Guerrilla Will, so I start there. They have a bare-basics website, which gets me pretty excited\u2014until I see how out of date it is. It\u2019s advertising plays from two summers ago. But still, there\u2019s a contact tab with an email address. I spend hours composing ten different emails and then finally just delete them in favor of a simple one:</p> <p>Hello:</p><p>I am trying to find a Dutch guy named Willem, age 20, who performed in last summer\u2019s run of Twelfth Night. I saw it and met him, in Stratford-upon-Avon, and went to Paris with him last August. If anyone knows where he is, please tell him that Lulu, also known as Allyson Healey, would like him to get in touch with her. This is very important.</p><p>I list all my contact info and then I pause there for a moment, imagining the ones and zeros or whatever it is that emails are made of, traveling across oceans and mountains, landing somewhere in someone\u2019s inbox. Who knows? Maybe even his.</p><p>And then I press Send.</p><p>Thirty seconds later, my inbox chimes. Could it be? Could it be that fast? That easy? Someone knows where he is. Or maybe he\u2019s been looking for me all this time.</p><p>My hand shakes as I go to my inbox. Only all that\u2019s there is the message I just sent, bounced. I check the address. I send it again. It bounces again.</p><p>\u201cStrike one,\u201d I tell Dee before class the next day. I explain about the bounced email.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do sports metaphors, but I\u2019m pretty sure baseball games are generally nine innings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMeaning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDig in for the long haul.\u201d</p><p>Professor Glenny sweeps in and starts talking about Cymbeline, the play we\u2019re about to start, and announcing last call for tickets for As You Like It before giving a brief warning to start thinking about oral presentations at the end of the year. \u201cYou can either work alone or with your partners, do a regular presentation or something more theatrical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do theatrical,\u201d Dee whispers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Glenny way.\u201d</p><p>And then we look at each other as if both getting the same idea. After class, we go up to the lectern where the usual coterie of groupies are simpering.</p><p>\u201cWell, Rosalind, here to buy your As You Like It tickets?\u201d</p><p>I blush. \u201cI already bought mine. I\u2019m actually trying to get ahold of someone I lost touch with, and I don\u2019t have very many leads, but the one I do have is through this Shakespeare troupe that I saw in Stratford-upon-Avon last year, and they have a website, but the email bounced, but I saw them do a play less than a year ago . . . \u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Stratford-upon-Avon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But not at a theater. It was sort of an underground thing. It was called Guerrilla Will. They performed at the canal basin. They were really good. I actually ditched the RSC\u2019s Hamlet to watch them do Twelfth Night.\u201d</p><p>Professor Glenny likes this. \u201cI see. And you\u2019ve lost a Sebastian, have you?\u201d I gasp and I blush but then I realize he\u2019s just referring to the play. \u201cI have an old mate in the tourist bureau there. Guerrilla Will, you say?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can dig up.\u201d</p><p>The following week, right before spring break, Professor Glenny hands me an address. \u201cThis is what my friend found. It\u2019s from police records. Apparently your Guerrilla Will friends have a habit of performing without permits, and this is from an old arrest. Not sure how current it is.\u201d I look at the address. It\u2019s for a city in England called Leeds.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. Let me know how it ends.\u201d</p><p>That night, I print out the copy of the email I sent to Guerrilla Will but then I change my mind and write a handwritten letter to Willem.</p><p>Dear Willem:</p><p>I\u2019ve been trying to forget about you and our day in Paris for nine months now, but as you can see, it\u2019s not going all that well. I guess more than anything, I want to know, did you just leave? If you did, it\u2019s okay. I mean it\u2019s not, but if I can know the truth, I can get over it. And if you didn\u2019t leave, I don\u2019t know what to say. Except I\u2019m sorry that I did.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what your response will be at getting this letter, like a ghost from your past. But no matter what happened, I hope you\u2019re okay.</p><p>I sign Lulu and Allyson and leave all my various contact details. I put it inside an envelope and write Forward to Willem, in care of Guerrilla Will. The night before I leave for spring break, I mail it.</p><p>I spend a boring break at home. Melanie\u2019s vacation doesn\u2019t coincide with mine, and I both miss her and feel relieved not to have to see her. I hole up in my room and prop my old science books all around me and spend the time doing Facebook searches and Twitter searches and every imaginable social networking search, but it turns out, only having a first name is kind of a problem. Especially because Willem is a pretty common Dutch name. Still, I go through hundreds of pages, staring at pictures of all different Willems, but none of them are him.</p><p>I post a Facebook page as Lulu with pictures of Louise Brooks and of me. I change the status every day, to something only he\u2019d understand. Do you believe in accidents of the universe? Is Nutella chocolate? Is falling in love the same as being in love? I get friend requests from New Age freaks. I get requests from perverts. I get requests from a Nutella fan club in Minnesota (who knew?). But nothing from him.</p><p>I try searching for his parents. I do combination searches: Willem, Bram, Yael and then just Bram, Yael. But without a last name, I get nothing. I search every Dutch naturopathic site I can find for a Yael but come up with nothing. I Google the name Yael, and it\u2019s a Hebrew name. Is his Mom Jewish? Israeli? Why didn\u2019t I think to ask him any of these questions when I had the chance? But I know why. Because when I was with him, I felt like I already knew him.</p><p>Twenty-four</p><p>Spring break ends, and in Shakespeare class we start reading Cymbeline. Dee and I are halfway through, at the really juicy part where Posthumus, Imogen\u2019s husband, sees Iachimo with the secret bracelet that he gave Imogen and decides this is proof that she cheated on him, though of course, the bracelet was stolen by Iachimo, precisely so he could win his bet with Posthumus that he could get Imogen to cheat.</p><p>\u201cAnother jumped conclusion,\u201d Dee says, looking at me pointedly.</p><p>\u201cWell, he did have good reason to suspect,\u201d I say. \u201cIachimo totally knew things about her, what her bedroom looked like, that she had a mole on her boob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he spied on her when she was sleeping,\u201d Dee says. \u201cThere was an explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. Just like you say there might be a good explanation for Willem disappearing. But you know, sometimes you do have accept the evidence at face value. In one day, I saw Willem flirt with, get undressed by, and get a telephone number from a minimum of three girls, not counting me. That says \u2018player\u2019 to me. And I got played.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a player, boy talked a lot about falling in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalling in love, not being in love,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd with C\u00e9line.\u201d Though when he spoke of his parents, of being stained, I recall the look on his face, one of unmasked yearning. And then I feel the heat on my wrist, as if his saliva were still wet there.</p><p>\u201cC\u00e9line,\u201d Dee says, snapping his fingers. \u201cThe hottie French girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t that hot.\u201d</p><p>Dee rolls his eyes. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we think of this? What\u2019s the name of the club she worked at? Where you left your bag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Where was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear the train station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich train station?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. I\u2019ve sort of blocked it all out.</p><p>Dee grabs my laptop. \u201cNow you\u2019re just being ornery.\u201d He taps away. \u201cIf you came from London, you arrived at Gare du Nord.\u201d He pronounces it Gary du Nord.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you clever?\u201d</p><p>He pulls up Google Maps and then types something in. A cluster of red flags appear. \u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are the nightclubs near Gare du Nord. You call them. Presumably C\u00e9line works in one of them. Find her, find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, maybe in the same bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllyson, you just said you had to have your eyes wide open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I just don\u2019t ever want to see C\u00e9line again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad do you want to find him?\u201d Dee asks.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess, more than anything, I want to find out what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to call this C\u00e9line person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m supposed to call all these clubs and ask for her? You forget, I don\u2019t speak French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow hard can it be?\u201d He stops and arranges his face into a puckered expression. \u201cBon lacroix monsoir oui, tres, chic chic croissant French Ho-bag.\u201d He smirks. \u201cSee? Easy peasy lemon squeezy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that French too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s Latin. And you can ask for the other guy too, the African.\u201d</p><p>The Giant. Him I wouldn\u2019t mind talking to, but of course, I don\u2019t even know his name.</p><p>\u201cYou do it. You\u2019re better at all that than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you on about? I studied Spanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just mean you\u2019re better at voices, pretending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you do Rosalind. And you spent a day playing Lulu, and you\u2019re currently masquerading as a pre-med student to your parents.\u201d</p><p>I look down, pick at my nail. \u201cThat just makes me a liar.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo it doesn\u2019t. You\u2019re just trying on different identities, like everyone in those Shakespeare plays. And the people we pretend at, they\u2019re already in us. That\u2019s why we pretend them in the first place.\u201d</p><p>Kali is taking first-year French, so I ask her, as casually as possible, how one might ask for C\u00e9line or a Senegalese bartender whose brother lives in Rochester. At first she looks at me, shocked. It\u2019s probably the first time I\u2019ve asked her something more involved than \u201cAre these socks yours?\u201d since school started.</p><p>\u201cWell, that would depend on lots of factors,\u201d she says. \u201cWho are these people? What is your relationship to them? French is a language of nuance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, can\u2019t they just be people I\u2019m wanting to get on the phone?\u201d</p> <p>Kali narrows her eyes at me, turns back to her work. \u201cTry an online translation program.\u201d</p><p>I take a deep breath, sigh out a gust. \u201cFine. They are, respectively, a total bitchy beauty and a really nice guy I met once. They both work at some Parisian night club, and I feel like they might hold the key to my . . . my happiness. Does that help you with your nuance?\u201d</p><p>Kali closes her textbook and turns to me. \u201cYes. And no.\u201d She grabs a piece of paper and taps it against her chin. \u201cDo you happen to know the brother from Rochester\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cHe told it to me once, really fast. Why?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cJust seems if you had it, you could track him down in Rochester and then find his brother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, my God, I didn\u2019t even think of that. Maybe I can remember it and try that too. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing things happen when you ask for help.\u201d She gives me a pointed look.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to know the whole story?\u201d</p><p>Her raised eyebrow says Do pigs like mud?</p><p>So I tell her, Kali, the unlikeliest of confidantes, a brief version of the saga.</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God. So that explains it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExplains what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you have been such a loner, always saying no to us. We thought you hated us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! I don\u2019t hate you. I just felt like a reject and felt so bad you guys got stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>Kali rolls her eyes. \u201cI broke up with my boyfriend right before I got here, and Jenn split with her girlfriend. Why do you think I have so many pictures of Buster? Everyone was feeling sad and homesick. That\u2019s why we partied so much.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t think to know. And then I laugh. \u201cI\u2019ve had the same best friend since I was seven. She\u2019s the only girlfriend I\u2019ve ever really hung out with, so it\u2019s like I missed the integral years of learning how to be friends with people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou missed nothing. Unless you missed kindergarten too.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her helplessly. Of course I went to kindergarten.</p><p>\u201cIf you went to kindergarten, you learned how to make friends. It\u2019s like the first thing they teach you.\u201d She stares at me. \u201cTo make a friend . . .\u201d she begins.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to be a friend,\u201d I finish, remembering the saying I was taught in Mrs. Finn\u2019s class. Or maybe it was from Barney.</p><p>She smiles as she picks up the pen. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be simpler if you just ask for this C\u00e9line chick and the bartender from Senegal, leave out the brother, because how many Senegalese bartenders are there? Then if you get the bartender, you can ask if he has a brother in Rochester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoch\u00e9 Estair,\u201d I correct. \u201cThat\u2019s what he called it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why. It sounds much classier that way. Here.\u201d She hands me a piece of paper. Je voudrais parler \u00e0 C\u00e9line ou au barman qui vient du Senegal, s\u2019il vous plait. She has written both the French and the phonetic translations. \u201cThat\u2019s how you ask for them in French. If you want help making the calls, let me know. Friends do that.\u201d</p><p>Je voudrais parler \u00e0 C\u00e9line ou au barman qui vient du Senegal, s\u2019il vous plait. One week later, I\u2019ve uttered this phrase so many times\u2014first to practice, then in a series of increasingly depressing phone calls\u2014that I swear I\u2019m saying it in my sleep. I make twenty-three phone calls. Je voudrais parler \u00e0 C\u00e9line ou au barman qui vient du Senegal, s\u2019il vous plait. . . . That\u2019s what I say. And then one of three things happens: One, I get hung up on. Two, I get some form of non\u2014and then hung up on. Those I cross off the list, a definitive no. But three is when the people launch into turbo-French, to which I am helpless to respond. C\u00e9line? Barman? Senegal? I repeat into the receiver, the words sinking like defective life rafts. I have no idea what these people are saying. Maybe they\u2019re saying C\u00e9line and the Giant are at lunch but will be back soon. Or maybe they\u2019re saying that C\u00e9line is here but she\u2019s downstairs having sex with a tall Dutchman.</p><p>I take Kali up on her offer of help, and sometimes she can suss out that there is no C\u00e9line, no Senegalese bartender, but more often than not, she\u2019s as baffled as I am. Meanwhile, she and Dee start Googling every potential Senegalese name in Rochester. We make a few embarrassing calls but come up empty.</p><p>After the twenty-fourth miserable phone call, I run out of nightclubs anywhere in the vicinity of Gare du Nord. Then I remember the name of the band on the T-shirt C\u00e9line had in the club, the one she gave to Willem\u2014and me. I Google Sous ou Sur and look up all their tour dates. But if they played at C\u00e9line\u2019s nightclub, it was a long time ago, because now they\u2019re apparently broken up.</p><p>By this point, more than three weeks have passed since I mailed my letter, so I\u2019m losing hope on that front too. The chances of finding him, never all that great, dim. But the strangest thing is, that feeling of rightness, it doesn\u2019t. If anything, it grows brighter.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your search for Sebastian going?\u201d Professor Glenny calls after class one day as we\u2019re lining up to get our Cymbeline papers back. The groupies all look at me with envy. Ever since I told him about Guerrilla Will, he has a newfound respect for me. And, of course, he\u2019s always loved Dee.</p><p>\u201cSort of dried up,\u201d I tell him. \u201cNo more leads.\u201d</p><p>He grins. \u201cAlways more leads. What is it the detectives in film always say? \u2018Gotta think outside the box.\u2019\u201d He says the last part in a terrible New York accent. He hands me my paper. \u201cNice work.\u201d</p><p>I look at the paper, at the big red A minus on it, and feel a huge rush of pride. As Dee and I walk to our next classes, I keep peeking at it, to make sure it doesn\u2019t shape-shift into a C, though I know it won\u2019t. I still can\u2019t stop looking. And grinning. Dee catches me and laughs.</p><p>\u201cFor some of us, these A grades are novel,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cOh, cry me a river. See you at four?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be counting the moments.\u201d</p><p>When Dee comes in at four, he\u2019s bouncing off the walls. \u201cNever mind thinking outside the box\u2014we got to look inside the box.\u201d He holds up two DVDs from the media center. The title on one reads Pandora\u2019s Box, and there\u2019s a picture of a beautiful woman with sad, dark eyes and a sleek helmet of black hair. I immediately know who she is.</p><p>\u201cHow are these going to help us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But when you open up Pandora\u2019s Box, you never know what\u2019s gonna fly out. We can watch them tonight. After I get off work.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019ll make popcorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take some leftover cakes from the dining hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know how to party on a Friday night.\u201d</p><p>Later, as I\u2019m getting ready for Dee, I see Kali in the lounge. She looks at the popcorn. \u201cHaving a snack attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDee and I are watching some movies.\u201d I\u2019ve never invited Kali anywhere. And she almost always goes out on weekend nights. But I think of the help she\u2019s offered, and what she said about being a friend, and so I invite her to join us. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a movie/fact-finding mission. We could use your help. You were so smart with your idea of trying to find the brother in Rochester.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen. \u201cI\u2019d love to help. I\u2019m so over keg parties. Jenn, wanna watch a movie with Allyson and Dee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you say yes, be warned, they\u2019re silent movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool,\u201d Jenn says. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen one before.\u201d</p><p>Neither have I, and turns out to be a little like watching Shakespeare. You have to adjust to it, to get into a rhythm. There are no words, but it\u2019s not like a foreign film, either, where all the dialogue is subtitled. Only major pieces of dialogue are shown with words. The rest you sort of have to figure out from the actors\u2019 expressions, from the context, from the swell of the orchestral music. You have to work a little bit.</p><p>We watch all of Pandora\u2019s Box, which is about a beautiful party girl named Lulu, who goes from man to man. First she marries her lover, then shoots him on the eve of her wedding. She\u2019s tried for murder but escapes jail, going into exile with her murdered husband\u2019s son. She winds up sold into prostitution. It ends with her getting killed on Christmas Eve, by Jack the Ripper, no less. We all watch it like you\u2019d watch a slow-motion train wreck.</p><p>After we finish, Dee pulls out the next one, Diary of a Lost Girl. \u201cThis one\u2019s a comedy,\u201d he jokes.</p><p>It\u2019s not quite as bad. Lulu, though she\u2019s not called that in this one, doesn\u2019t die in the end. But she does get seduced, have a baby out of wedlock, get the baby taken away from her, wind up cast out and dumped in a horrible reform school. She too dabbles in prostitution.</p><p>It\u2019s almost two in the morning when we flick on the lights. We all look at each other, bleary-eyed.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Jenn asks.</p><p>\u201cI like her outfits,\u201d Kali says.</p><p>\u201cThe outfits were indeed extraordinary, but not exactly enlightening.\u201d Dee turns to me. \u201cAny clues?\u201d</p><p>I look around. \u201cI got nothin\u2019.\u201d And really, I don\u2019t. All this time, I\u2019ve been thinking I was like Lulu. But I\u2019m nothing like the girl in those movies. I wouldn\u2019t want to be.</p><p>Jenn yawns and opens a laptop and pulls up a page on Louise Brooks, who apparently had a life as tumultuous as Lulu\u2019s, going from A-list movie star to a shopgirl at Saks, winding up a kept woman, and finally a recluse. \u201cBut it says here she was always a rebel. She always did things her own way. And she had a lesbian affair with Greta Garbo!\u201d Jenn smiles at that.</p><p>Kali grabs the computer and reads. \u201cAlso, she pioneered the short bobbed haircut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hair was cut into a bob when we met. I probably should\u2019ve mentioned that.\u201d</p><p>Kali puts the computer down and takes my hair out of its ponytail and folds it up to my chin. \u201cHmm. With your hair bobbed, you do sort of look like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what he said. That I looked like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he saw you that way,\u201d Jenn says, \u201cit means he thought you were very beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Maybe. Or maybe this is all some game to him. Or calling me Lulu was a way to distance me, so he never had to learn anything about me.\u201d But as I throw out the less romantic scenarios\u2014and let\u2019s be honest, the more likely ones\u2014I don\u2019t feel that usual clutch of shame and humiliation. With these guys at my back, nothing feels quite so fraught.</p><p>Kendra\u2019s staying over at Jeb\u2019s, so Kali offers her bed to Dee, and she crashes on Kendra\u2019s bed. When all of us nestle under our covers, we call out good night to each other, like we\u2019re in summer camp or something, and I feel that sense of rightness, stronger than ever.</p><p>Dee starts snoring straightaway, but it takes me a long time to drift off, because I\u2019m still wondering about Lulu. Maybe it was just a name. Maybe it was just pretend. But at some point, it stopped being pretend. Because for that day, I really did become Lulu. Maybe not the Lulu from the film or the real Louise Brooks, but my own idea of what Lulu represented. Freedom. Daring. Adventure. Saying yes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I realize it\u2019s not just Willem I\u2019m looking for; it\u2019s Lulu, too.</p><p>Twenty-five</p><p>APRIL</p><p>Miami Beach</p> <p>Mom and Dad are waiting for me at my gate in the Miami airport, Mom having arranged for their flight to get in a half hour before mine.

Tradition is tradition, and Passover is the one time of year we go to Grandma\u2019s.</p><p>I love Grandma, and even if the Seders are always mind-numbingly dull and you take your life in your own hands eating so much of Grandma\u2019s home cooking, that\u2019s not why I dread them.</p><p>Grandma makes Mom crazy, which means that whenever we\u2019re visiting, Mom makes us crazy. When Grandma visits us at home, it\u2019s dealable. Mom can get away, go vent to Susan, play tennis, organize the calendar, go to the mall to buy me a new wardrobe I don\u2019t need. But when we\u2019re at Grandma\u2019s old-people condo in Miami Beach, it\u2019s like being trapped on a geriatric island.</p><p>Mom starts in on me at the baggage claim, sniping at me for not sending thank-you notes out for my birthday presents, which means she must have asked Grandma and Susan if they\u2019d gotten theirs. Because other than Jenn and Kali\u2014who baked me a cake\u2014and Dee\u2014who took me out to his favorite food truck in Boston for dinner\u2014and Mom and Dad, of course, there was no one else to send thank-you cards to this year. Melanie didn\u2019t send anything. She just posted a greeting on my Facebook page.</p><p>Once we get into a cab (the second one, Mom having rejected the first one because the AC was too weak\u2014no one is safe from Mom when she\u2019s on a Grandma trajectory)\u2014she starts in on me about my summer plans.</p> <p>Back in February, when she first brought this up, asking what I was going to do over the summer, I told her I had no idea. Then, a few weeks later, at the end of spring break, she announced that she had made some inquiries on my behalf and used some connections and now had two promising offers. One is working in a lab at one of the pharmaceutical companies near Philadelphia. The other is working in one of Dad\u2019s doctor friend\u2019s offices, a proctologist named Dr. Baumgartner (Melanie used to call him Dr. Bum-Gardner). Neither job would be paid, she explained, but she and Dad had discussed it and decided they\u2019d counter the loss with a generous allowance. She looked so pleased with herself. Both jobs would look excellent on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, would go a long way toward offsetting what she referred to as the \u201cdebacle\u201d of my first term.</p><p>I\u2019d been so irritated, I\u2019d almost told her that I couldn\u2019t take those internships because I wasn\u2019t qualified; I wasn\u2019t pre-med. Just to spite her. Just to see the look on her face. But then I\u2019d gotten scared. I was getting an A in Shakespeare Out Loud. An A minus in Mandarin, which was a first for me. A solid B in my biology class and labs, and an A in ceramics. I realized I was actually proud of how well I was doing in my classes and I didn\u2019t want Mom\u2019s inevitable and perennial disappointment to poison that. But that was going to happen no matter what, though I was sticking to my plan A\u2014to show her my final grades when I made the announcement.</p><p>But finals are still three weeks away, and Mom is breathing down my neck right now about these jobs. So as we pull into Grandma\u2019s high-rise, I tell her that I\u2019m still mulling it over and then I skip out of the cab to help Dad with the bags.</p><p>It\u2019s so strange. Mom is the most formidable person I know, but when Grandma opens the door, Mom seems to shrink, as if Grandma is some ogre instead of a five-foot bottle blonde in a yellow tracksuit and a KISS THE MESHUGGENEH COOK apron. Grandma grabs me in a fierce hug that smells of Shalimar and chicken fat. \u201cAlly! Let me look at you! You\u2019re doing something different with your hair! I saw the pictures on Facebook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on Facebook?\u201d Mom asks.</p><p>\u201cAlly and I are friends, aren\u2019t we?\u201d She winks at me.</p> <p>I see Mom wince. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because Grandma and I are FB friends or because Grandma insists on shortening my name.</p><p>We step inside. Grandma\u2019s boyfriend, Phil, is asleep on the big floral couch. A basketball game blares from the giant television.</p><p>Grandma touches my hair. It\u2019s to my shoulders now. I haven\u2019t cut it since last summer. \u201cIt was shorter before,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of in between.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better than it was. That bob was awful!\u201d Mom says.</p><p>\u201cIt was a bob, Mom. Not a Mohawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it was. But it made you look like a boy.\u201d</p><p>I turn to Grandma. \u201cWas she traumatized by a bad haircut in her youth? Because she seems unwilling to let this go.\u201d</p><p>Grandma claps her hands. \u201cOh, Ally, you might be right. When she was ten, she saw Rosemary\u2019s Baby and begged me to take her to the children\u2019s beauty parlor. She kept making the lady go shorter until it was all off, and as we were leaving the salon, another mother pointed Ellie out to her son and said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you get a haircut like that nice little boy?\u2019\u201d She looks at Mom, smiling. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that still upset you, Ellie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t upset me, because it never happened, Mother. I never saw Rosemary\u2019s Baby. And if I had, at ten, that would\u2019ve been entirely inappropriate, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can show you the pictures!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d</p><p>Grandma eyes Mom\u2019s hair. \u201cYou might think of trying that pixie again now. I think you\u2019ve been wearing the same style since Bill Clinton was president.\u201d Grandma gives another wicked grin.</p><p>Mom seems to shrink another inch as she touches her hair\u2014straight, brown, in a low ponytail. Grandma leaves her like that, pulling me into the kitchen. \u201cYou want some cookies? I have some macaroons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacaroons are not cookies, Grandma. They\u2019re coconut cookie substitutes. And they\u2019re disgusting.\u201d Grandma doesn\u2019t keep anything in the house with flour during Passover.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see what else I have.\u201d I follow Grandma into the kitchen. She pours me some of her diet lemonade. \u201cYour mom is having such a hard time,\u201d Grandma says. When Mom\u2019s out of sight, she\u2019s sympathetic, almost defending her, like I was the one who riled her up.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why. She has a charmed life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, that\u2019s what she says about you whenever she thinks you\u2019re being ungrateful.\u201d Grandma opens the oven door to check on something. \u201cShe\u2019s having a hard time adjusting, with you being gone. You\u2019re all she\u2019s got.\u201d</p><p>I feel a pit in my stomach. Another way I\u2019ve let Mom down.</p><p>Grandma puts out a plate of those gross jelly candies I can never resist. \u201cI told her she should have another child, give her something to do with herself.\u201d</p><p>I spit out my lemonade. \u201cShe\u2019s forty-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could adopt.\u201d Grandma waves her hand. \u201cOne of those Chinese orphans. Lucy Rosenbaum got a cute one as a granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not dogs, Grandma!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. Still, she could get an older one. It\u2019s a real mitzvah then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell Mom that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d</p><p>Grandma always brings up things the rest of us don\u2019t. Like she lights a memorial candle on the anniversary of when Mom had her miscarriage all those years ago. This, too, drives Mom crazy.</p><p>\u201cShe needs to do something if she\u2019s not going back to work.\u201d She glances out toward the living room. I know Mom and Grandma fight about Mom not working. Once, Grandma sent a clipping from a news magazine about how badly the ex-wives of doctors fared financially in the event of divorce. They didn\u2019t speak for months after that.</p><p>Mom comes into the kitchen. She glances at the jelly candy. \u201cMother, can you feed her some real food, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, cool your jets. She can feed herself. She\u2019s nineteen now.\u201d She winks at me, then turns to Mom. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take some cold cuts out?\u201d</p><p>Mom pokes in Grandma\u2019s refrigerator. \u201cWhere\u2019s the brisket? It\u2019s almost two now. We should put it in soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s already cooking,\u201d Grandma says.</p><p>\u201cWhat time did you put in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry. I got a nice recipe from the paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been in?\u201d Mom peeks in the oven. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big. It shouldn\u2019t take longer than three hours. And you have to cover it in foil. Also you have the heat way up. Brisket\u2019s meant to slow-cook. We\u2019re starting the Seder at five? When did it go in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever you mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be like leather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I tell you how to cook in your kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. All the time. But I don\u2019t listen. And we\u2019ve dodged many a case of food poisoning because of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough of your smart mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll go change,\u201d I announce. But neither one is paying attention to me anymore.</p><p>I go into the spare room and find Dad hiding in there, looking wistfully at a golf shirt. \u201cWhat are the chances I can escape for a round?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to throw down some plagues at the Pharaoh first.\u201d I look out the window to the silver-blue strip of sea.</p><p>He puts the golf shirt back in the suitcase. How quickly we all give in to her. This Seder means nothing to him. Dad\u2019s not even Jewish, though he celebrates all the holidays with Mom. Grandma was supposedly furious when Mom got engaged to him, though after Grandpa died, she took up with Phil, who\u2019s not Jewish, either.</p><p>\u201cI was just kidding,\u201d I say, even though I wasn\u2019t. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go?\u201d</p><p>Dad shakes his head. \u201cYour mom needs backup.\u201d</p><p>I scoff, as if Mom needs anything from anyone.</p><p>Dad changes the subject. \u201cWe saw Melanie last weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer band had a gig in Philadelphia, so she made a rare appearance.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s in a band now? So she can become Mel 4.0\u2014and I\u2019m supposed to stay reliably me? I smile tightly at my dad, pretending like I know this.</p><p>\u201cFrank, I can\u2019t find my Seder plate,\u201d Grandma calls. \u201cI had it out for a polish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust visualize the last place you had it,\u201d Dad says. Then he gives me a little shrug and heads off to help. After the Seder plate is located, he helps Grandma get down serving bowls, and then I hear Mom tell him to keep Phil company, so he sits and watches the basketball with napping Phil. So much for golf. I go out onto the balcony and listen to the competing sounds of Mom and Grandma\u2019s bickering and the game on the TV. My life feels so small it itches, like a too-tight wool sweater.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going for a walk,\u201d I announce, even though there\u2019s no one on the balcony but me. I put on my shoes and slip out the door and walk down to the beach. I take off my shoes and run up and down the shore. The rhythmic beat of my feet on the wet sand seems to churn something out of me, pushing it through the sweat on my sticky skin. After a while, I stop and sit down and look out over the water. On the other side is Europe. Somewhere over there is him. And somewhere over there, a different version of me.</p><p>When I get back, Mom tells me to shower and set the table. At five, we sit down, settling in for a long night of reenacting the Jews\u2019 escape from slavery in ancient Egypt, which is supposed to be an act of liberation, but somehow with Mom and Grandma glowering at each other, it always winds up feeling just like more oppression. At least the adults can get drunk. You have to down, like, four glasses of wine during the night. I, of course, get grape juice, in my own crystal carafe. At least I usually do. This time when I go to drink my first sip of juice after the first blessing, I almost choke. It\u2019s wine. I think it\u2019s a mistake, except Grandma catches my eye and winks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Seder carries on as usual. Mom, who, in every other part of her life, is respectful, assumes the mantle of rebellious teenager. When Grandma reads the part about the Jews wandering through the desert for forty years, Mom cracks it\u2019s because Moses was a man who refused to ask directions. When the talk to turns to Israel, Mom harps on about politics, even though she knows this gets Grandma crazy. When we eat matzo-ball soup, they argue about the cholesterol content of matzo balls.</p><p>Dad knows enough to keep quiet. And Phil plays with his hearing aids and dozes in and out of consciousness. I refill my \u201cjuice\u201d glass many, many times.</p><p>After two hours, we get to the brisket, which means we get to stop talking about Exodus for a while, which is a relief, even if the brisket isn\u2019t. It\u2019s so dry it looks like beef jerky and tastes charred. I move it around my plate, while Grandma chitchats about her bridge club and the cruise she and Phil are taking. Then she asks about our annual summer trip to Rehoboth Beach, which she usually comes up for a portion of.</p><p>\u201cWhat else do you have planned for the summer?\u201d she asks me casually.</p> <p>It\u2019s a throwaway question, really. Along the lines of how are you? Or what\u2019s new? I\u2019m about to say, \u201cOh, this and that,\u201d when Mom interrupts to say that I\u2019m working in a lab. Then she tells Grandma all about it. A research lab at a pharmaceutical company. Apparently, I accepted the position just today.</p><p>It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t know she would do this. It\u2019s not like she hasn\u2019t done this my entire life. It\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t let her.</p><p>The fury that fills me feels hot and cold, liquid and metal, coating my insides like a second skeleton, one stronger than my own. Maybe this is what allows me to say, \u201cI\u2019m not working in a lab this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s too late,\u201d Mom snaps back. \u201cI already called Dr. Baumgartner to decline his offer. If you\u2019d had a preference, you had three weeks to make it known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not working at Dr. Baumgartner\u2019s, either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you line up something else?\u201d Dad asks.</p><p>Mom scoffs, as if that\u2019s unthinkable. And maybe it is. I\u2019ve never had a job. Never had to get one. Never had to do anything for myself. I am helpless. I am a void. A disappointment. My helplessness, my dependency, my passivity, I feel it whorling into a little fiery ball, and I harness that ball, somewhere wondering how something made of weakness can feel so strong. But the ball grows hotter, so hot, the only thing I can do with it is hurl it. At her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think your lab would want me anymore, given that I\u2019ve dropped most of my science courses and am going to drop the rest of them come fall,\u201d I say, spite dripping from my voice. \u201cSee, I\u2019m not pre-med anymore. So sorry to disappoint you.\u201d</p><p>My sarcasm hangs in the humid air\u2014and then, like a vapor, it floats away as I realize that, for the first time in my life, I\u2019m not sorry to disappoint her. Maybe it\u2019s the spite talking, or maybe Grandma\u2019s secret wine, but I\u2019m almost glad of it. I\u2019m so tired of avoiding the unavoidable, because I feel like I\u2019ve been disappointing her for such a long time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve dropped pre-med?\u201d Her voice is quiet, that lethal mix of fury and woundedness that could always take me down like a bullet to the heart.</p><p>\u201cThat was always your dream, Ellie,\u201d Grandma says, shielding me. She turns to me. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t answered my question, Ally. What are you doing this summer?\u201d</p> <p>Mom is looking so fragile and so angry, and I feel my will starting to break, feel myself starting to give in. But then I hear a voice\u2014my voice\u2014announcing this:</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going back to Paris.\u201d</p><p>It comes out, as if the idea were fully formed, something plotted for months, when in fact, it just slipped out, the same way all those admissions to Willem did. But when it does, I feel a thousand pounds lighter, my anger now fully dissipated, replaced by exhilaration flowing through me like sunlight and air.</p><p>This is how I felt that day in Paris with Willem. And this is how I know that it\u2019s the right thing to do.</p><p>\u201cAlso, I\u2019m learning French,\u201d I add. And for some reason, this announcement makes the table erupt into pandemonium. Mom starts screaming at me about lying to her and throwing my whole future away. Dad is yelling about switching majors and who\u2019s going to pay for my exchange program to Paris. Grandma is yelling at Mom for ruining yet another Seder.</p><p>So with all the commotion, it\u2019s a little strange that anyone can hear Phil, who has barely said a word since the soup, when he pipes up, \u201cBack to Paris, Ally? I thought Helen said your trip to Paris got canceled because they were striking.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cThey always seem to be striking over there.\u201d</p><p>The table goes silent. Phil picks up a piece of matzo and starts munching on it. Mom, Dad, and Grandma all stare at me.</p><p>I could so easily cover this up. Phil\u2019s hearing aid was turned down. He heard wrong. I could say that I want to go to Paris because I never made it there on the last trip. I\u2019ve told so many lies. What\u2019s one more?</p> <p>But I don\u2019t want to lie. I don\u2019t want to cover up. I don\u2019t want to pretend anymore. Because that day with Willem, I may have pretended to be someone named Lulu, but I had never been more honest in my life.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s the thing with liberation. It comes at a price. Forty years wandering through the desert. Or incurring the wrath of two very pissed-off parents.</p><p>I take a breath. I brave up.</p><p>\u201cBack to Paris,\u201d I say.</p><p>Twenty-six</p><p>MAY</p><p>Home</p><p>I make a new list.</p><p> Airfare to Paris: $1200</p><p> French class at community college: $400</p><p> Spending money for two weeks in Europe: $1000.</p><p>All together that\u2019s $2,600. That\u2019s how much money I\u2019ll need to save to get to Europe. Mom and Dad are not helping with the trip, obviously, and they\u2019re refusing to let me use any of the money in my savings account, from gifts through the years, because that\u2019s supposed to be for educational purposes, and they\u2019re the trustees on the account, so I can\u2019t argue. Besides, it\u2019s only through Grandma\u2019s intervention, coupled with my threat to go live at Dee\u2019s for the summer that Mom has even agreed to let me live at home. She\u2019s that mad. She\u2019s that mad without even knowing the entire story. I told them I went to Paris. I didn\u2019t tell them why. Or with whom. Or why I need to go back, except that I left something important there\u2014they think it\u2019s the suitcase.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what infuriates her more. Last summer\u2019s deceit or the fact that I won\u2019t tell her everything about it. She refused to speak to me after the Seder and then four weeks went by with barely a word from her. Now that I\u2019m back home for the start of the summer she basically avoids me. Which is both a relief and also kind of scary, because she\u2019s never done anything like this before.</p><p>Dee says that twenty-six hundred dollars is a lot for two months, but not impossible. He suggests skipping the French class. But I feel like I need to do that. I\u2019ve always wanted to learn French. And I\u2019m not going back to Paris\u2014not facing down C\u00e9line\u2014without it.</p><p>So, twenty-six hundred bucks. Doable. If I get a job. But the thing is, I\u2019ve never had a job before. Nothing remotely job-like, beyond babysitting and filing at Dad\u2019s office, which hardly fills the spiffy new r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that I\u2019ve printed on beautiful card stock. Maybe this explains why, after dropping it off at every business in town with a job opening, I get zero response.</p><p>I decide to sell my clock collection. I take them to an antique dealer in Philadelphia. He offers me five hundred bucks for the lot. I\u2019ve easily spent double that on the clocks over the years, but he just looks at me and says that maybe I\u2019ll do better on eBay. But that would take months, and I just want to be rid of them. So I hand over the clocks, except for a Betty Boop one, which I send to Dee.</p><p>When Mom finds out what I\u2019ve done, she shakes her head with such profound disgust, like I have just sold my body, not my clocks. The disapproval intensifies. It wafts through the house like a radiation cloud. Nowhere is safe to hide.</p><p>I have to get a job. Not just to earn the money but to get out of this house. Escaping to Melanie\u2019s isn\u2019t an option. Number one, we\u2019re not speaking, and number two, she\u2019s at a music program in Maine for the first half of summer\u2014this according to my dad.</p><p>\u201cYou just gotta keep trying,?? Dee advises when I call him for job advice from our landline. As part of my punishment, my cell phone has been turned off, and the family Internet password protected, so I have to ask them to log me onto the web or else go to the library. \u201cDrop your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 at every business in town, not just the ones saying they\u2019re hiring, \u2019cause usually places that are desperate enough to hire someone like you don\u2019t have time to advertise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a job? Swallow your pride. And drop off a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven the car wash?\u201d I joke.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Even the car wash.\u201d Dee isn\u2019t kidding. \u201cAnd ask to speak to the manager of the car wash and treat him like the King of All Car Washes.\u201d</p><p>I imagine myself scrubbing hubcaps. But then I think of Dee, working in a pillow factory this summer or hosing off dishes in the dining hall. He does what he has to do. So the next day, I print out fifty new r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and just go door to door, from bookstore to sewing shop to grocery store, CPA firm to the liquor store to, yes, the car wash. I don\u2019t just drop my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I ask to speak to managers. Sometimes the managers come out. They ask me about my experience. They ask me how long I want to be employed for. I listen to my own answers: No real job experience to speak of. Two months. I get why nobody\u2019s hiring me.</p><p>I\u2019m almost out of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s when I pass by Caf\u00e9 Finlay. It\u2019s a small restaurant on the edge of town, all done up in 1950s d\u00e9cor, with black-and-white-checked floors and a mishmash of Formica tables. Every other time I\u2019ve gone past, it seemed to be closed.</p><p>But today music is blasting from inside so loud the windows are vibrating. I push the door, and it nudges open. I shout \u201chello.\u201d No one replies. The chairs are all stacked up on the tables. There\u2019s a pile of fresh linens on one of the booths. Yesterday\u2019s specials are scrawled on a chalkboard on the wall. Things like halibut with an orange tequila jalape\u00f1o beurre blanc with kiwi fruit. Mom calls the food here \u201ceclectic,\u201d her code for weird, which is why we\u2019ve never eaten here. I don\u2019t know anyone who eats here.</p><p>\u201cYou here with the bread?\u201d</p><p>I spin around. There\u2019s a woman, Amazon tall and just as broad, with wild red hair poking out from under a blue bandanna.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker!\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I hold out a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. She waves it away. \u201cEver work in a kitchen?\u201d I shake my head.</p><p>\u201cSorry. No,\u201d she says.</p><p>She looks at the Marilyn Monroe wall clock. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, Jonas!\u201d She shakes her fist at the door.</p><p>I turn to leave, but then I stop. \u201cWhat\u2019s the bread order?\u201d I ask. \u201cI\u2019ll run and get it for you.\u201d</p><p>She glances at the clock again and sighs dramatically. \u201cGrimaldi\u2019s. I need eighteen French baguettes, six loaves of the Harvest. And a couple of day-old brioche. You got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink so\u2019s not gonna butter the bread, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen baguettes. Six loaves of Harvest and a couple of day-old brioche.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake sure it\u2019s stale brioche. Can\u2019t make bread pudding with fresh bread. And ask for Jonas. Tell him it\u2019s for Babs and tell him he can throw in the brioche for free and knock twenty percent off the rest because his damn delivery guy was a no-show again. Also, make sure I don\u2019t get any sourdough. I hate that shit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She grabs a wad of cash from the vintage register. I take it from her and sprint to the bakery as fast as I can, get Jonas, bark the order, and run back with it, which is harder than it sounds, carrying thirty loaves of bread.</p><p>I pant as Babs looks over the bread order. \u201cYou know how to wash dishes?\u201d</p><p>I nod. That much I can do.</p><p>She shakes her head in resignation. \u201cGo to the back and ask Nathaniel to introduce you to Hobart.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHobart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. You two\u2019ll be getting intimate.\u201d</p><p>Hobart turns out to be the name of the industrial dish washer, and once the restaurant opens, I spend hours with it, rinsing dishes with a giant hose, loading them in Hobart, unloading them while they\u2019re still scalding hot and repeating the whole enterprise. By some miracle, I manage to stay on top of the never-ending flow of dishes and not drop anything or burn my fingers too badly. When there\u2019s a lull, Babs orders me to cut bread or whip cream by hand (she insists it tastes better that way) or mop the floor or find the tenderloins from one of the walk-in coolers. I spend the night in an adrenaline panic, thinking I\u2019m about to screw up.</p><p>Nathaniel, the prep cook, helps me as much as he can, telling me where things are, helping me scrub saut\u00e9 pans when I get too slammed. \u201cJust wait till the weekend,\u201d he warns.</p><p>\u201cI thought no one ever ate here.\u201d I put my hand over my mouth, instinctually knowing Babs would be mad to hear that.</p> <p>But Nathaniel just laughs. \u201cAre you kidding? Babs is worshipped by the Philadelphia foodies. They make the trek out here just for her. She\u2019d make way more money if she moved to Philly, but she says her dogs would hate it in the city. And by dogs, I think she means us.\u201d</p><p>When the last of the diners leave, the kitchen staff and the waiters seem to all exhale at once. Someone blasts some old Rolling Stones. A bunch of tables are pushed together and everyone sits down. It\u2019s well past midnight, and I have a long walk home. I start to pack up my things, but Nathaniel motions for me to join them. I sit at the table, feeling shy even though I\u2019ve been bumping hips with these people all night.</p><p>\u201cYou want a beer?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe have to pay for them, but only cost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you can have some of the reject wine the distributors bring by,\u201d a waitress named Gillian says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take some wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like someone died on you,\u201d says one of the waiters. I look down. My nice skirt and top\u2014my good job- hunting outfit\u2014are covered in sauces that look vaguely like bodily fluids.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m the one who died,\u201d I say. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been this tired. My muscles ache. My hands are red from the near-scalding water. And my feet? Don\u2019t get me started.</p><p>Gillian laughs. \u201cSpoken like a true kitchen slave.\u201d</p><p>Babs appears with the big bowls of steaming pasta and small chunks of leftover fish and steak. My stomach lets out a gurgle. The platters get passed around. I don\u2019t know if her cooking is \u201ceclectic,\u201d but the food is amazing, the orange tequila jalape\u00f1o sauce is only faintly orange, and it\u2019s smoky rather than spicy. I clear my plate, and then sop up any remaining sauce with a hunk of Jonas\u2019s not-sourdough bread.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d Babs asks me when I\u2019ve finished.</p><p>All eyes turn to me. \u201cIt\u2019s the second best meal I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d I say. Which is the truth.</p><p>Everyone else oohs, like I\u2019ve just insulted Babs. But she just smirks. \u201cI\u2019ll bet your first best was with a lover,\u201d she says, and I go as red as her hair.</p><p>Babs instructs me to return the next day at five, and the routine starts all over again. I work harder than I ever have, eat an amazing meal, and pour myself into bed. I have no idea if I\u2019m filling in for someone or maybe being auditioned. Babs screams at me constantly, for using soap on her cast-iron saut\u00e9 pan or not getting the lipstick off the coffee cups before they go into Hobart or making the whipped cream too stiff or not stiff enough or not adding the exact right amount of vanilla extract. But by the fourth night, I\u2019m learning not to take it so personally.</p><p>On the fifth night, before the dinner rush, Babs calls me to the back near the walk-in refrigerator. She\u2019s sucking on a bottle of vodka, which is what she does before the rush begins. Her lipstick leaves smudges on the rim. For a second, I think this is it, that she\u2019s going to fire me. But instead she hands me a sheaf of documents.</p> <p>\u201cTax forms,\u201d she explains. \u201cI pay minimum wage, but you\u2019ll get tips. Which reminds me. You keep forgetting to collect yours.\u201d She reaches under the counter for an envelope with my name on it.</p><p>I open up the envelope. There\u2019s a wad of cash in there. Easily a hundred dollars. \u201cThis is mine?\u201d</p><p>She nods. \u201cWe pool tips. Everyone gets a cut.\u201d</p><p>I run my fingers over the money. The bills snag on my ragged hangnails. My hands are beyond thrashed, but I don\u2019t care because they\u2019re thrashed from my job. Which has earned me this money. I feel something well up inside me that has nothing to do with airplane tickets or Paris trips or money at all, really.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll go up in the fall,\u201d Babs says. \u201cSummer\u2019s our slow season.\u201d</p><p>I hesitate. \u201cThat\u2019s great. Except I won\u2019t be here in the fall.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkles her red brows. \u201cBut I just broke you in.\u201d</p><p>I feel bad, guilty, but it was right there on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, the first line\u2014Objective: To obtain short-term employment. Of course, Babs never read my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cI go to college,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work around your schedule. Gillian\u2019s a student too. And Nathaniel, on and off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She pauses. \u201cOh, well. I think Gordon\u2019s coming back after Labor Day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping to leave by the end of July. But only if I can save two thousand dollars by then.\u201d And as I say it, I do the math. More than a hundred bucks a week in tips, plus wages\u2014I actually might be able to pull it off.</p><p>\u201cSaving for a car?\u201d she asks absentmindedly. She takes another swig of her vodka. \u201cYou can buy mine. That beast\u2019ll be the death of me.\u201d Babs drives an ancient Thunderbird.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m saving for Paris.\u201d</p><p>She puts her bottle down. \u201cParis?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in Paris?\u201d</p><p>I look at her. I think of him for the first time in a while. In the craziness of the kitchen, he became a little abstract. \u201cAnswers.\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head with such vehemence her auburn curls come loose from her bandanna. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to Paris looking for answers. You have to go looking for questions\u2014or, at the very least, macarons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacaroons? The coconut things?\u201d I think of the gross cookie replacements we eat on Passover.</p><p>\u201cNot macaroons. Macarons. They\u2019re meringue cookies in pastel colors. They are edible angel\u2019s kisses.\u201d She looks at me. \u201cYou need two thousand bucks by when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAugust.\u201d</p><p>She narrows her eyes at me. They\u2019re always a little bit bloodshot, though, oddly, more so at the beginning of a shift than at the end, when they take on a sort of manic gleam. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal. If you don\u2019t mind working some doubles for weekend brunch, I\u2019ll make sure you earn your two grand by July twenty-fifth, which is when I close the restaurant for two weeks for my summer vacation. On one condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery day in Paris, you eat a macaron. They have to be fresh, so no buying a pack and eating one a day.\u201d She stops and closes her eyes. \u201cI ate my first macaron in Paris on my honeymoon. I\u2019m divorced now, but some loves are enduring. Especially if they happen in Paris.\u201d</p><p>A tiny chill prickles up my neck. \u201cDo you really believe that?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>She takes a slug of vodka, her eyes glinting knowingly. \u201cAhh, it\u2019s those kind of answers you\u2019re after. Well, I can\u2019t help you with that, but if you hustle into the walk-in and find the buttermilk and the cream, I can give you the answer to the proverbial question of how to make the perfect cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-seven</p><p>JUNE</p><p>Home</p><p>Intro to French runs three days a week for six weeks, from eleven thirty to one, giving me yet another reason to be out of the House of Disapproval. Though I\u2019m at Caf\u00e9 Finlay five nights a week these days, and all day on weekends, on weekdays, I still don\u2019t go in until five. And the restaurant is closed on Monday and Tuesday, so there\u2019s a lot of dead time for Mom and me to avoid each other in.</p><p>On the first day of class, I arrive a half hour early and grab an iced tea from the little kiosk and find the classroom and start looking through my book. There\u2019s lots of pictures of France, many from Paris.</p><p>The other students start to filter in. I expected college kids, but everyone except me is my parents\u2019 age. One woman with frosted blond hair plops down at the desk next to mine and introduces herself as Carol and offers me a piece of gum. I gladly accept her handshake but decline the gum\u2014it doesn\u2019t seem very French to chew gum in class.</p><p>A birdlike woman with cropped gray hair strides in. She looks like she stepped out of a magazine in her tight linen pencil skirt and little silk blouse, both perfectly pressed, which seems impossible, given the ninety percent humidity outside. Plus, she\u2019s wearing a scarf, also strange, given the ninety percent humidity.</p><p>Clearly, she is French. And if the scarf wasn\u2019t a giveaway, then there\u2019s the fact that she marches up to the front of the room and starts speaking. In French.</p><p>\u201cAre we in the wrong class?\u201d Carol whispers. Then the teacher goes to the board and writes her name, Madame Lambert, and the name of the class, Intro to French. She also writes it in French. \u201cOh, no such luck,\u201d Carol says.</p><p>Madame Lambert turns to us and in the thickest accent imaginable tells us in English that this is beginning French, but that the best way to learn French is to speak and hear it. And that is about the only English I hear for the next hour and a half.</p><p>\u201cJe m\u2019appelle Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Lambert,\u201d she says, making it sound like this: Teh-rez. Lomb-behr. \u201cComment vous appelez-vous?\u201d</p><p>The class stares at her. She repeats the question, gesturing to herself, then pointing to us. Still no one answers. She rolls her eyes and does this clicking with her teeth. She points to me. Clicks again, gestures for me to stand up. \u201cJe m\u2019appelle Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Lambert,\u201d she repeats, enunciating slowly and tapping her chest. \u201cComment t\u2019appelles-tu?\u201d</p><p>I stand there for a second frozen, feeling like it\u2019s C\u00e9line again jabbering away at me disdainfully. Madame Lambert repeats the question. I get that she\u2019s asking me my name. But I don\u2019t speak French. If I did, I wouldn\u2019t be here. In Intro to French.</p><p>But she\u2019s just waiting now. She\u2019s not letting me sit down.</p><p>\u201cJe m\u2019appelle Allyson?\u201d I try.</p><p>She beams, as though I\u2019ve just explained the origins of the French Revolution, in French. \u201cBravo! Enchant\u00e9e, Allyson.\u201d</p><p>And she goes around the class asking everyone else\u2019s name the same way.</p><p>That was round one. Then comes round two: \u201cPourquoi voulez-vous apprendre le fran\u00e7ais?\u201d</p><p>She repeats the question, writing it down on the board, circling certain words and writing their English translations. Pourquoi: why. Apprendre: learn. Voulez-vous: do you want. Oh, I see. She\u2019s asking why we want to learn French.</p><p>I have no clue how to begin to answer that. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.</p><p>But then she continues.</p><p>\u201cJe veux apprendre le fran\u00e7ais parce que . . .\u201d She circles Je veux: I want. Parce que: because. She repeats it three times. Then points to us.</p><p>\u201cI can do this one. I know this word from the movie,\u201d Carol whispers. She raises her hand. \u201cJe veux apprendre le fran\u00e7ais parce que,\u201d she stumbles over the words and her accent is awful, but Madame just watches her expectantly. \u201cParce que le divorce!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Madame Lambert says, only she says it in the French way, which makes it sound even more excellent. Le divorce, she writes on the board. \u201cDivorce. La m\u00eame,\u201d she says. The same, she writes. Then she writes down le mariage and explains that this is the antonym.</p><p>Carol leans in. \u201cWhen I divorced my husband, I told myself I was going to let myself get fat and I was going to learn French. If I do as well with the French as I\u2019m doing with the fat, I\u2019ll be fluent by September!\u201d</p><p>Madame Lambert goes around the room, and people stumble to explain why they want to learn French. Two of the people are going on vacation in France. One is going to study art history and needs some French. One thinks it\u2019s pretty. In each case, Madame writes down the word, its translation, and its opposite. Vacation: vacances. Work: travail.</p><p>I went first last time, and this time I\u2019m last. I\u2019m in a bit of panic by then, trying to think of what to say. How do you say accidents in French? Or because I think I might have made a mistake. Or Romeo and Juliet. Or to find a lost thing. Or because I don\u2019t want to compete, I just want to speak French. But I don\u2019t know how to say that in French. If I did, I wouldn\u2019t be here.</p> <p>Then I remember Willem. The Nutella. Falling in love versus being in love. How did he say it? Stain in French? Sash? Tache?</p><p>\u201cAllyson,\u201d she says. \u201cPourquoi veux-tu apprendre le fran\u00e7ais?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJe veux apprendre le fran\u00e7ais,\u201d I begin, mimicking what I\u2019ve just heard everyone else say. I\u2019ve got that part down. \u201cParce que . . .\u201d I stop to think. \u201cLe tache,\u201d I say finally.</p><p>It\u2019s such a weird thing to say, if that\u2019s what I\u2019ve said. A stain. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. But Madame Lambert gives a stern nod and writes la t\u00e2che on the board. Then she writes task. I wonder if I remembered the word wrong. She looks at me, at my confusion. And then she writes another word on the board. La tache: stain.</p><p>I nod my head. Yes, that\u2019s it. She doesn\u2019t write down an opposite. There is no opposite of stain.</p> <p>When we\u2019re all done, Madame smiles and claps. \u201cC\u2019est courageux d\u2019aller dans l\u2019inconnu,\u201d she says, writing it down on the board. She has us write it down and deconstruct it with a dictionary. Courageux we get is courageous. Dans is into. L'inconnu is the unknown. D\u2019aller. It takes us twenty minutes, but we finally get it: It\u2019s courageous to go into territory unknown. When we figure this out, the class is as proud as Madame.</p><p>Still, I spend the first week of class living in a state of half terror of being called on\u2014because everyone gets called on a lot; there are only six of us, and Madame is a big fan of class participation. Whenever we get shy, she reminds us, \u201cC\u2019est courageux d\u2019aller dans l\u2019inconnu.\u201d Eventually, I just sort of get over myself. I blunder every time I speak, and I know I\u2019m butchering the grammar, and my pronunciation is awful, but then we\u2019re all in the same boat. The more I do it, the less self-conscious I get and the easier it is to just try.</p><p>\u201cI feel like a damn fool, but it might just be working,\u201d Carol says one afternoon after class.</p><p>She and I and a few of the other students have started getting together for coffee or lunch after class to practice, to recover from Madame Lambert\u2019s verbal barrages, and to deconstruct what she really means when she goes \u201cpff\u201d and blows air through her lips. There\u2019s a whole language in her pffs.</p><p>\u201cI think I had a dream in French,\u201d Carol says. \u201cI was telling my ex terrible things in perfect French.\u201d She grins at the memory.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m that advanced, but I\u2019m definitely getting the hang of it,\u201d I reply. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019m just getting the hang of feeling like an idiot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUn idiot,\u201d Carol says it in French. \u201cHalf the time, you add a French accent and it works. But getting over feeling like un idiot might just be half the battle.\u201d</p><p>I imagine myself, alone in Paris. There are so many battles I\u2019m going to have to fight, traveling alone, facing C\u00e9line, speaking French\u2014all of it is so daunting, some days I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually even attempting it. But I think Carol might be right about this, and the more I flub and get over it in class, somehow, the better prepared I feel for the trip. Not just the French. All of it. C\u2019est courageux d\u2019aller dans l\u2019inconnu.</p><p>At the restaurant, Babs blabs to the entire staff that I\u2019m saving to go to Paris to meet my lover, and I\u2019m learning French because he speaks no English, so now Gillian and Nathaniel have taken it upon themselves to tutor me. Babs is doing her part by adding a bunch of French items to the specials menu, including macarons, which apparently take hours to make, but when I eat them\u2014oh, my God, I get what all the fuss is about. Pale pink, hard outside, but spongy and light and delicate inside, with a raspberry deliciousness filling.</p><p>In between classes, hanging with my fellow students, and being at work, I\u2019m spending a fair amount of time, if not speaking French, then thinking about it. When Gillian buses plates into the kitchen, she\u2019ll drill me on verbs. \u201cEat,\u201d she\u2019ll call out. \u201cJe mange, tu manges, il mange, nous man- geons, vous mangez, ils mangent,\u201d I\u2019ll call back. Nathaniel, who doesn\u2019t actually speak French but used to have a French girlfriend, teaches me how to swear. Specifically, how to fight with your girlfriend.</p><p>T\u2019es toujours aussi salope? Are you always such a bitch?</p><p>T\u2019as tes r\u00e8gles ou quoi? Are you on the rag or what?</p><p>And ferme ta gueule! Which he claims means: Shut your piehole!</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t say \u2018shut your piehole\u2019 in France,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s not a direct translation, but it\u2019s pretty damn close,\u201d he replies.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s so crass. The French are tasteful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, those people sainted Jerry Lewis. They\u2019re human just like you and me.\u201d He pauses, then grins. \u201cExcept for the women. They\u2019re superhuman.\u201d</p><p>I think of C\u00e9line and get a bad feeling in my stomach.</p><p>Another one of the waiters loans me his Rosetta Stone CDs, and I start practicing with those too. After a few weeks, I start to notice that my French is improving, that when Madame Lambert calls on me to describe what I\u2019m eating for lunch, I can handle it. I start to speak in phrases, then sentences, sentences I don\u2019t have to map out beforehand like I do with Mandarin. Somehow, it\u2019s happening. I\u2019m doing it.</p><p>One morning, toward the end of the month, I come downstairs to find Mom at the kitchen table. In front of her is the catalog from the community college and her checkbook. I say good morning and go the fridge for some orange juice. Mom just watches me. I\u2019m about to take my juice out to the back patio, which is sort of what we\u2019ve done if Dad\u2019s not home as a buffer\u2014if she\u2019s in one room, I go into another\u2014when she tells me to sit down.</p><p>\u201cYour father and I have decided to reimburse you for your French class,\u201d she says, ripping off the check. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we condone any part of this trip. Or condone your duplicity. We absolutely don\u2019t. But the French class is part of your education, and you\u2019re obviously taking it seriously, so you shouldn\u2019t have to pay for it.\u201d</p><p>She hands me the check. It\u2019s for four hundred dollars. It\u2019s a lot of money. But I\u2019ve already saved nearly a thousand dollars, even with the money I paid for my class, and I just put a deposit down on an airplane ticket to Paris, and Babs is advancing me a week\u2019s wages so I can buy it next week. And I have a month yet to save. The four hundred dollars would take the edge off. But the thing is, maybe I don\u2019t need the edge to be off.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I tell Mom, handing back the check. \u201cBut thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t want it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you need it,\u201d she retorts. \u201cParis is expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019m saving a lot of money from my job, and I\u2019m hardly spending anything this summer. I don\u2019t even have to pay for gas.\u201d I try to make a joke out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s another thing. If you\u2019re going to be working until all hours, you should take the car at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t want to leave you stranded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, call me for a ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late. And I usually get a lift home from someone.\u201d</p><p>She takes the check back and with a violence that surprises me, rips it up. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t do anything for you anymore, can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want my money or my car or my ride. I tried to help you get a job, and you don\u2019t need me for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m nineteen,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cI am aware of how old you are, Allyson. I did give birth to you!\u201d Her voice cracks like a whip, and the snap of it seems to startle even her.</p><p>Sometimes, you can only feel something by its absence. By the empty space it leaves behind. As I look at Mom, all pissed and pinched, I finally get that she\u2019s not just angry. She\u2019s hurt. A wave of sympathy washes over me, taking away a chink of my anger. Once it\u2019s gone, I realize how much of it I have. How angry I am at her. Have been for this past year. Maybe a lot longer.</p><p>\u201cI know you gave birth to me,\u201d I tell her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just I\u2019ve spent nineteen years raising you, and now I\u2019m being shut out of your life. I can\u2019t know anything about you. I don\u2019t know what classes you\u2019re taking. I don\u2019t know who you\u2019re friends with anymore. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re going to Paris.\u201d She lets out something between a shudder and a sigh.</p><p>\u201cBut I know,\u201d I tell her. \u201cAnd for now, can\u2019t that be enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it can\u2019t,\u201d she snaps.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019ll have to be,\u201d I snap back.</p><p>\u201cSo you dictate the rules now, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any rules. I\u2019m not dictating anything. I\u2019m just saying you have to trust the job you did raising me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid. Past tense. I wish you\u2019d stop talking like you\u2019re laying me off from my job.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m startled by that, not by her thinking of me as a job, so much as by the implication that I am in a position to do the firing. \u201cI thought you were going to go back to some kind of PR job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d She guffaws. \u201cI said I\u2019d do it when you started middle school. When you started high school. When you got your driver\u2019s license.\u201d She rubs her eyes with the heels of her hands. \u201cDon\u2019t you think if I\u2019d wanted to go back, I\u2019d have done it by now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor things to be how they were.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, this makes me angry. Because it\u2019s both true\u2014she wants to keep me fossilized\u2014and such a lie. \u201cEven when things were \u2018how they were,\u2019 it was never enough. I was never enough.\u201d</p><p>Mom looks up, her eyes tired and surprised at the same time. \u201cOf course you were,\u201d she says. \u201cYou are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what bothers me? How you and Dad always say you quit while you were ahead. There\u2019s no such thing as quitting while you\u2019re ahead. You quit while you were behind. That\u2019s why you quit!\u201d</p><p>Mom frowns, exasperated; it\u2019s her dealing-with-a-crazy-teenager look, one I\u2019ve gotten to know well this past year, my last year of actually being a teenager. Oddly enough, it wasn\u2019t something she had to zing me with much before. Which I now realize was maybe part of the problem.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted more kids,\u201d I continue. \u201cAnd you had to settle for just me. And you\u2019ve spent my whole life trying make me be enough.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That gets her attention. \u201cWhat are you talking about? You are enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. How can I be? I\u2019m the one shot, the heir and the spare, so you have to make damn sure your one investment pays off because there\u2019s no backup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. You\u2019re not an investment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou treat me like one. You\u2019ve poured all your expectations into me. It\u2019s like I have to carry the load of hopes and dreams for all the kids you didn\u2019t get to have.\u201d</p> <p>She shakes her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she says in a quiet voice.</p><p>\u201cReally? Medical school at thirteen. Come. On! What thirteen-year-old wants to go to medical school?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Mom looks likes she\u2019s been punched in the gut. Then she places her hand on her stomach, as if covering the place of impact. \u201cThis thirteen-year-old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019m totally confused now. But then I remember how in high school, Dad always sent me to Mom when I needed help with chem or bio, even though he was the doctor. And I can hear Mom reciting the pre-med requisites by heart when the college catalog came. And I think about the job she once had, doing public relations, but for a drug company. Then I remember what Grandma said to her at the disastrous Seder: That was always your dream.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou wanted to be a doctor.\u201d</p> <p>She nods. \u201cI was studying for the MCATs when I met your father. He was just in his first year of medical school and somehow found the time to tutor in his spare time. I took the tests, applied to ten schools, and didn\u2019t get into one. Your father said it was because I didn\u2019t have any lab experience. So I went to work at Glaxo, and I thought I\u2019d apply again, but then your father and I got married, and I wound up moving over to PR, and then a few years went by, and we decided to start a family, and I didn\u2019t want your father and me to both be in the midst of school and residencies with a small baby and then we had all the fertility issues. When we gave up on having another child, I quit working\u2014because we could afford to live on your father\u2019s income. I thought about applying again, but then I discovered I liked spending time with you. I didn\u2019t want to be away from you.\u201d</p><p>My head is spinning. \u201cYou always said you and Dad were set up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were. By the campus tutoring center. I never told you everything because I didn\u2019t want you to feel like I\u2019d given up on account of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want me to know you\u2019d quit when you were behind,\u201d I clarify. Because isn\u2019t that exactly what she did do?</p><p>Mom reaches out to grab my wrists. \u201cNo! Allyson, you\u2019re wrong about quitting while you\u2019re ahead. It means being grateful. Stopping when you realize what you have is enough.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t entirely believe her. \u201cIf that\u2019s true, maybe you should quit while you\u2019re ahead now\u2014before things between us get really messed up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you asking me to quit being your mother?\u201d</p><p>At first I think the question is rhetorical, but then I see her looking at me, her eyes wide and fearful, and a little bit of my heart breaks to think she\u2019d ever truly think that.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I say quietly. There\u2019s a moment of silence as I steel myself to say the next thing. Mom stiffens, like she\u2019s maybe steeling herself too. \u201cBut I am asking you to be a different kind of mother.\u201d</p><p>She slumps back in her chair, I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s in relief or defeat. \u201cAnd what do I get out of this?\u201d</p><p>For a brief second, I can picture us one day, having tea, me telling her all about what happened in Paris last summer, what will happen on this trip I\u2019m about to take. One day. Just not yet.</p><p>\u201cA different kind of daughter,\u201d I say.</p><p>Twenty-eight</p><p>JULY</p> <p>Home</p><p>I\u2019ve bought my airplane ticket. I\u2019ve paid for my French class, and even with both of those expenditures, I still have five hundred dollars saved by the end of a surprisingly busy and lucrative July Fourth weekend. Caf\u00e9 Finlay closes on July 25, but unless things go disastrously in the next three weeks, I should have enough money saved by then.</p><p>Right after the Fourth of July, Melanie comes home. My parents told me she\u2019d be back from camp for a week before heading off to a rafting trip in Colorado. By the time she gets back from that, I\u2019ll be gone. And by the time I come back from Europe, it\u2019ll be time for school. I wonder if the entire summer is going to pass, as the last six months have, as if our friendship never existed. When I see Melanie\u2019s car in her driveway, I don\u2019t say anything. Mom doesn\u2019t either, which is how I know that she and Susan have discussed our falling-out.</p><p>French class comes to an end. During the last week, each of us has to give an oral presentation about something particularly French. I give mine on macarons, explaining their origins and how they\u2019re made. I dress up in one of Babs\u2019s chef aprons and wear a beret, and when I\u2019m done, I hand out macarons that Babs made special for the class, along with Caf\u00e9 Finlay postcards.</p><p>I am coming home from class in Mom\u2019s car, which I\u2019ve borrowed to lug all my presentation stuff, when I see Melanie in her driveway. She sees me too, and we look at each other for a moment. It\u2019s like we\u2019re asking each other, Are we both going to pretend the other doesn\u2019t exist? That we don\u2019t exist?</p><p>But we do exist. At least we used to. And so I wave to her. Then I walk toward the neutral territory of the sidewalk. Melanie does too. When she gets closer, her eyes widen. I look at my silly costume.</p><p>\u201cFrench class,\u201d I explain. \u201cHere, do you want a macaron?\u201d I pull out one of the extras that I was bringing home for Mom and Dad.</p><p>\u201cOh, thanks.\u201d She takes a bite, and her eyes widen. I want to say, I know. But with all the months gone by, I don\u2019t. Because maybe I don\u2019t know. Not anymore.</p><p>\u201cSo French class?\u201d she says. \u201cWe both did the summer-school thing this year, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight, you were in Portland. At a music program?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes light up. \u201cYeah. It was intense. Not just playing, but composing and learning about different facets of the industry. We had these professionals come in to work with us. I composed an experimental piece that I\u2019m going to produce at school next year.\u201d Her whole face glows. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to major in music theory. What about you?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I think I like languages.\u201d In addition to Mandarin, this fall, I\u2019ll take French, along with another Shakespeare class with Professor Glenny. Intro to Semiotics. And African Dance.</p><p>She looks up, hesitates for a second. \u201cSo, no Rehoboth Beach this summer?\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ve gone to the same summer house since I was five. But not this year. \u201cDad was invited to a conference in Hawaii, and he convinced Mom to go with him. As a personal favor to me, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re going to Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019m going to Paris.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a pause. In the background, I can hear the neighbor kids splashing around in the sprinklers. Just like Melanie and I used to.</p><p>\u201cTo find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to know. If something happened. I just need to find out.\u201d</p><p>I brace myself for Melanie\u2019s derision, for her to scoff or laugh at me. But she just considers what I\u2019ve said. And when she says the next thing, it\u2019s not snide so much as matter-of-fact: \u201cEven if you find him. Even if he didn\u2019t leave you on purpose, he can\u2019t possibly live up to the person you\u2019ve built him into.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not like the thought hasn\u2019t occurred to me. I get that the chances of finding him are small, but the chances of finding him as I remember him are even smaller. But I just keep going back to what my dad always says, about how when you lose something, you have to visualize the last place you had it. And I found\u2014and then lost\u2014so many things in Paris.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I tell Melanie. And it\u2019s weird because I don\u2019t feel defensive. I feel a little bit relieved because it almost seems like Melanie is worrying about me again. And also relieved because I\u2019m not worrying about me. Not about this, anyhow. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it matters.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widen at that. Then she narrows them, looks me up and down. \u201cYou look different.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cNo. I still look like me. It\u2019s just this outfit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the outfit,\u201d Melanie says, almost harshly. \u201cYou just seem different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well . . . thanks?\u201d</p><p>I look at Melanie, and for the first time, I notice how she seems. Which is utterly familiar. Like Melanie again. Her hair is growing out and is back to its natural color. She\u2019s wearing cutoff shorts, a cute embroidered tee. No nose rings. No tats. No multicolored hair. No slutty-chic outfits. Of course, just because she looks the same has no bearing on whether she actually is the same. It hits me that Melanie\u2019s year was probably was just as tumultuous as mine in ways that I didn\u2019t understand, either.</p><p>Melanie is still staring at me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says at last.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cFor forcing you to cut your hair in London when you weren\u2019t ready. I felt so bad when you cried like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. And I\u2019m glad I did it.\u201d And I am. Maybe he never would\u2019ve stopped me had I not had the Louise Brooks hair. Or maybe he would\u2019ve, and we would\u2019ve exchanged actual names. I\u2019ll never know. Once accidents happen, there\u2019s no backtracking.</p><p>We both just stand there on the sidewalk, hands at our sides, unsure of what to say. I hear the neighbor kids yelp in the sprinklers. I think of me and Melanie when we were younger, on the high dive at the pool in Mexico. We would always hold hands as we jumped, but by the time we swam back up to the surface, we\u2019d have let go. No matter how we tried, once we started swimming, we always let go. But after we bobbed to the surface, we\u2019d climb out of the pool, clamber up the high-dive ladder, clasp hands, and do it again.</p><p>We\u2019re swimming separately now. I get that. Maybe it\u2019s just what you have to do to keep above water. But who knows? Maybe one day, we\u2019ll climb out, grab hands, and jump again.</p><p>Twenty-nine</p><p>New York City</p><p>My parents want to drive me to JFK, but I\u2019ve made plans to spend the day with Dee before I go, so they drop me off at 30th Street Station in Philadelphia. I\u2019m going to take the train\u2014my first train in a year\u2014to Manhattan, and Dee will meet me at Penn Station. Tomorrow night, I catch my flight to London and then onward to Paris.</p><p>When my train is announced, we walk toward the platform. Dad taps his toes impatiently, visions of Maui golf courses dancing through his head. They leave on Monday. Mom just paces. Then when my train\u2019s headlights are visible in the distance, she pulls a box out of her purse.</p><p>\u201cI thought we weren\u2019t doing presents this time.\u201d Last year, there\u2019d been the big dinner out, lots of little last-minute gadgets. Last night was more low-key. Homemade lasagna in the dining room. Both Mom and I pushed it around our plates.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s less for you than for me.\u201d</p><p>I open the box. Inside is a small cell phone with a charger and a plug adapter.</p><p>\u201cYou got me a new phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean yes. I mean, your old phone, we\u2019ll unfreeze the plan when you get back. But this is a special quad-band phone. It definitely works in Europe. You just have to buy a . . . what are they called?\u201d she asks Dad.</p><p>\u201cSIM card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d She fumbles to flick open the back. \u201cThey\u2019re very inexpensive, apparently. So you can get a local number anywhere you go and have a phone if you need one, and you can call us in an emergency or text us\u2014but only if you choose to. It\u2019s more for you, so you have a way to reach us. If you need to. But you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMom,\u201d I interrupt, \u201cit\u2019s okay.

He scoops me up in a big hug.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your suitcase?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I turn around, show off the olive backpack I got from the Army-Navy surplus store in Philadelphia.</p> <p>Dee whistles. \u201cHow\u2019d you fit your ball gown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt folds down really small.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d have a bigger bag, and I told Mama we\u2019d come back home before we went out exploring, so she made lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like lunch.\u201d</p><p>Dee throws up his hands. \u201cActually, Mama planned a surprise party for you. Don\u2019t tell her I told.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA party? She doesn\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe thinks she does by how much I talk about you, and she\u2019ll use any excuse to cook. My family\u2019s coming, including my cousin Tanya. I told you about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one who does hair?\u201d</p><p>Dee nods. \u201cI asked her if she\u2019d do yours. She does white-girl hair too, works in a fancy salon in Manhattan. I thought maybe you could get a bob again, go all Louise Brooks. Look just like you did when you met. You gotta do something with that mop.\u201d He fingers my hair, up, as usual, in a clip.</p><p>We take the subway all the way uptown, to the last stop on the train. We get out and transfer to a bus. I look out the window, expecting the rough-and-tumble streets of the South Bronx, but the bus passes a bunch of pretty brick buildings all shaded by mature trees.</p><p>\u201cThis is the South Bronx?\u201d I ask Dee.</p><p>\u201cI never said I lived in the South Bronx.\u201d</p><p>I look at him. \u201cAre you serious? I\u2019ve heard you say a bunch of times that you\u2019re from the South Bronx.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only said that I was from the Bronx. This is the Bronx, technically. It\u2019s Riverdale.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you told Kendra you were from the South Bronx. You told her you went to South Bronx High School. . . .\u201d I pause, remembering that first conversation. \u201cWhich does not even exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left the girl to her own jumped conclusions.\u201d He gives me a knowing smirk. He rings the bell to get off the bus. We exit onto a busy street full of tall apartment buildings. It\u2019s not fancy, but it\u2019s nice.</p><p>\u201cYou are a master pretender, D\u2019Angelo Harrison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakes one to know one. I am from the Bronx. And I am poor. If people want to translate that as ghetto boy, that\u2019s their choice.\u201d He smiles. \u201cEspecially if they want to throw scholarship money my way.\u201d</p><p>We arrive at a pretty brick building with cracked gargoyles hanging over the front entrance. Dee rings the buzzer\u2014\u201cso they know we\u2019re coming\u201d\u2014and then we take one of those ancient caged-in elevators to the fifth floor. Outside the front door, he looks at me and tucks some strands of stray hair behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cAct surprised,\u201d he whispers and opens the door.</p><p>We step into a party, about a dozen people crowded into the small living room where there\u2019s a BON VOYAGE ALLYSON sign tacked up over a table laden with food. I look at Dee, eyes wide in shock.</p><p>\u201cSurprise!\u201d he says, twinkling jazz hands.</p><p>Dee\u2019s mother, Sandra, comes up to me and wraps me in a gardenia-scented bear hug. \u201cHe told you, didn\u2019t he? That was the worst look of surprise I ever saw. My baby couldn\u2019t keep a secret if was stapled to him. Well, come on, then, meet the folk, have some food.\u201d</p><p>Sandra, introduces me to various aunts and uncles and cousins and gives me a plate of barbecued chicken and mac and cheese and some greens and sits me down at a table. \u201cNow you hold court.\u201d</p><p>Dee has pretty much told everyone about Willem, so they all have advice on how to track him down. Then they start peppering me with questions about the trip. How I\u2019m getting there\u2014a flight from New York to London and then on to Paris\u2014and where I\u2019m staying\u2014a youth hostel in the Villette area Willem and I hung out in, twenty-five bucks a night for a dorm\u2014and how I\u2019ll get around\u2014with the help of a guidebook, and I will brave the Metro. And they ask about Paris, and I tell them about what I saw last year, and they\u2019re very interested to hear how diverse it was, about the sections that were full of Africans and then this starts a big debate about which African countries France colonized until someone goes for a map to figure it out.</p><p>While everyone pores over the atlas, Sandra comes up with a plate of peach cobbler. \u201cI got you a little something,\u201d she says, handing me a thin package.</p><p>\u201cOh, you shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>She waves away my objections like stale air. I open the package. Inside is a laminated map of Paris. \u201cThe man at the store said this would be \u2018indispensable.\u2019 It has all the subway stops and an index of major streets.\u201d She opens the map to show me. \u201cAnd D\u2019Angelo and I spent so many hours looking at it, it has our good blessings coursing through it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll never get lost again.\u201d</p><p>She folds the map up and puts it in my hands. She has the same eyes as Dee. \u201cI want to thank you for helping my boy this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe helping Dee?\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI think you have it the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly the way I have it,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cNo, seriously. All Dee has done is help me. It\u2019s almost embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop with such nonsense. D\u2019Angelo is both brilliant and blessed with the road life has taken him on. But it\u2019s not been easy for him. In his four years of high school and one year of college, you are the first friend from school he\u2019s ever talked about, much less brought home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are talking about me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Dee asks. He puts an arm around each of us. \u201cExtolling my brilliance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtolling your something,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t either of you believe a word!\u201d He turns around to introduce a tall, regal girl with a head full of intricate twists. \u201cI was telling you about Tanya.\u201d</p><p>We exchange hellos, and Sandra goes off to fetch some more cobbler. Tanya reaches out to free my hair from its clip. She fingers the ends and shakes her head, clucking her tongue the same disapproving way Dee so often does.</p><p>\u201cI know. I know. It\u2019s been a year,\u201d I say. And then I realize it has. A year.</p><p>\u201cWas it short or long?\u201d Dee asks. He turns to Tanya. \u201cYou have to make her look just the same. For when she finds him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I find him,\u201d I clarify. \u201cIt was to here.\u201d I point to the base of my skull, where the stylist in London had cut my hair to last year. But then I drop my hand. \u201cYou know, though. I don\u2019t think I want the bob.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want a haircut?\u201d Tanya asks.</p><p>\u201cNo, I would love a haircut,\u201d I tell her. \u201cBut not a bob. I want to try something totally new.\u201d</p><p>Thirty</p><p>Paris</p><p>It takes approximately thirteen hours and six time zones for me to freak out.</p><p>It happens when I stumble into the arrivals hall of Charles de Gaulle airport. All around me, other passengers are being greeted by hugging relatives or drivers with signs. I\u2019m not being met by anyone. No one is expecting me. No one is watching out for me. I know I have people out there in the world who love me, but right now, I\u2019ve never felt so alone. I feel that flashing sign click on over my head, the one that used to read TOURIST. Only now it also reads WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?</p><p>I pull my backpack straps tighter around my chest, like they could hug me. I take a deep breath. I pick up one leg and put it in front the other. A step. I take another. And another. I pull out the to-do list I made on the plane. Number one: exchange money.</p><p>I go to one of the many foreign exchange bureaus and in halting French ask if I can exchange my dollars. \u201cOf course. This is a bank,\u201d the man behind the counter answers in French. I hand over a hundred dollars and am too relieved to bother to count the euros I get in return.</p><p>Next on the list: find youth hostel. I\u2019ve mapped the route, a train to the city, then a Metro to the Jaur\u00e8s stop. I follow the signs for the RER, the train to central Paris, but it turns out I have to take an airport train to get to the RER station, and I go the wrong way and wind up at a different terminal and have to double back around, so it takes me almost an hour just to get to the airport train station.</p><p>When I get up to the automated ticket machines, it\u2019s like facing off against an enemy. Even with choosing English as the language, the instructions are bewildering. Do I need a Metro ticket? A train ticket? Two tickets? I feel that neon sign over my flash brighter. Now it says WHAT THE HELL HAVE YOU DONE?</p><p>I open the guidebook again to the section about getting into Paris. Okay, one ticket will get me into Paris and transfer to the Metro. I look at the map of the Paris Metro. The different lines knot together like snakes. Finally, I locate my stop, Jaur\u00e8s. I trace the RER line to the airport to the transfer point and realize with a start that it\u2019s at Gare du Nord. Someplace familiar, someplace to tie me to that day.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Allyson, no way through it but through it,\u201d I tell myself. And then I face the ticket machine, shoulders back, like we are competitors in a duel. I punch the touch screen, feed it a ten-euro note and then it spits me back some change and a tiny ticket. A small victory against an impassive opponent, but I am flush with satisfaction.</p><p>I follow the throngs to the gates, which work like the Tube gates, though it turns out, it\u2019s much easier to get through them when you\u2019re not lugging a giant suitcase. Ha! Another enemy foiled.</p><p>In the Metro/RER interchange beneath Gare du Nord, I get lost again trying to find the right Metro line, and then I misplace my little ticket, which you need not only to get out of RER but into the Metro. Then I almost get on the Metro going the wrong direction but figure it out right before the doors close and jump off. When I finally arrive at my stop, I\u2019m completely exhausted and totally disoriented. It takes about fifteen minutes poring over the map just to figure where I am. I take a half dozen more wrong turns until I hit the canals, which is the first sign that I\u2019m in the right area.</p><p>But I still have no idea where the hostel is, and I\u2019m exhausted, frustrated, and near tears. I can\u2019t even find the hostel. And I have an address. And a map. What in the world makes me think I can find him?</p><p>But then just when I\u2019m about to lose it, I stop, look out at the canals, and I just breathe. And my panic subsides. Because this place, it feels familiar. It is familiar, because I\u2019ve been here before.</p><p>I fold up my map and put it away. I breathe some more. I look around. There are the same gray bicycles. There are the same stylish women, teetering across the cobblestones on heels. The caf\u00e9s, crowded, as though no one ever has to work. I take another deep breath, and a sort of sense memory takes over. And somehow I just know where I am. To the left is the park with the lake where we met Jacques and the Danes. To my right, a few blocks back, is the cafe where we had cr\u00eapes. I take the map out again. I find myself. Five minutes later, I\u2019m at the youth hostel.</p><p>My room is on the sixth floor, and the elevator is out of order, so I walk up a winding stairway. A guy with a tattoo of some sort of Greek god on his arm points out the breakfast room, the communal bathrooms (coed), and then my room, with seven beds. He gives me a lock and shows me where I can store my stuff when I go out. Then he leaves me with a bonne chance, which means good luck, and I wonder if he says that to everyone or if he senses that I\u2019ll need it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I sit down on the bed and unhook the sleeping bag from the top of my backpack, and as I slump into the springy mattress, I wonder if Willem has stayed here. Has slept in this very bed. It\u2019s not likely, but it\u2019s not impossible either. This is the neighborhood he introduced me to. And everything seems possible right now, this feeling of rightness, throbbing right alongside my heartbeat, soothing me to sleep.</p><p>I wake up a few hours later with drool on my pillow and static in my head. I take a lukewarm shower, shampooing the jet lag out of my hair. Then I towel it try and put in the gel like Tanya showed me\u2014wash and wear, she said. It\u2019s very different, all chunks and layers, and I like it.</p><p>Downstairs, the clock on the lobby wall behind the giant spray-painted peace sign reads seven o\u2019clock; I haven\u2019t eaten anything since the hard roll and yogurt they gave me on the plane over from London, and I\u2019m woozy with hunger. The little caf\u00e9 in the lobby only serves drinks. I know that part of traveling alone means eating alone and ordering in French, and I practiced that a lot with Madame Lambert. And it\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t eaten alone plenty of times in the dining hall this past year. But I decide I\u2019ve conquered enough things for one day. Tonight, I can get a sandwich and eat in my room.</p><p>In front of the hostel, a bunch of people are hanging out in the drizzle. They\u2019re speaking English in what I think are Australian accents. I take a breath and walk over and ask them if they know of a place to get a good sandwich nearby.</p> <p>One muscular girl with streaky brown hair and a ruddy face turns to me and smiles brightly. \u201cOh, there\u2019s a place over the canal that makes gorgeous smoked salmon sandwiches,\u201d she says. She points out the way and then she resumes talking to her friend about a bistro that supposedly sells a prix fixe for twelve euro, fifteen with a glass of wine.</p><p>My mouth waters at the mere thought of it, the food, the company. It seems incredibly presumptuous to invite myself, the kind of thing I would never do.</p><p>But then again, I\u2019m alone in Paris, so this is all virgin territory. I tap the Australian girl on her sunburnt shoulder and ask if I can tag along with them for dinner. \u201cIt\u2019s my first day traveling, and I\u2019m not sure where to go,\u201d I explain.</p><p>\u201cGood on you,\u201d she replies. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been at it for ages. We\u2019re on our OAs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOAs?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOverseas Adventures. It\u2019s so bloody expensive to get out of Australia that once you go, you stay gone. I\u2019m Kelly, by the way. This is Mick, that\u2019s Nick, that\u2019s Nico, short for Nicola, and that\u2019s Shazzer. She\u2019s from England, but we love her anyway.\u201d</p><p>Shazzer sticks her tongue out at Kelly, smiles at me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Allyson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my mum\u2019s name!\u201d Kelly says. \u201cAnd I was just saying I was missing my mum! Wasn\u2019t I? It\u2019s karma!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKismet,\u201d Nico corrects.</p><p>\u201cThat too.\u201d</p> <p>Kelly looks at me, and for half a second, I stand there, because she hasn\u2019t said yes and I\u2019m going to feel like an idiot if she says no. Still, maybe it\u2019s all that prep in French class, but I\u2019m kind of okay with feeling like an idiot. The group starts to walk off, and I start to turn toward the sandwich place. Then Kelly turns around.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then,\u201d she says to me. \u201cDon\u2019t know about you, but I could eat a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might do. They eat those here,\u201d Shazzer says.</p><p>\u201cNo they don\u2019t,\u201d one of the guys says. Mick or Nick. I\u2019m not quite sure who\u2019s who.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Japan,\u201d Nico says. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicacy there.\u201d</p><p>We start walking, and I listen as the rest of them argue over whether or not the French eat horse meat, and as I amble along, it hits me that I\u2019m doing it. Going to dinner. In Paris. With people I met five minutes ago. Somehow, more than anything else that\u2019s happened in the last year, this blows my mind.</p><p>On the way to the restaurant, we stop so I can get a SIM card for my phone. Then, after getting slightly lost, we find the place and wait for a table big enough to seat us all. The menu\u2019s in French, but I can understand it. I order a delicious salad with beets that\u2019s so beautiful I take a picture of it to text my mom. She immediately texts me back the less artful looking loco moco that Dad is having for breakfast. For my entr\u00e9e, it\u2019s some kind of mystery fish in a peppery sauce. I\u2019m having such a nice time, mostly listening to their outrageous travel tales, that it\u2019s only when it\u2019s time for dessert that I remember my promise to Babs. I check out the menu, but there are no macarons on it. It\u2019s already ten o\u2019clock, and the shops are closed. Day one, and I\u2019ve already blown my promise.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I say. \u201cOr make that merde!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mick/Nick asks.\u2019\u2019</p><p>I explain about the macarons, and everyone listens, rapt.</p><p>\u201cYou should ask the waiter,\u201d Nico says. \u201cI used to work at a place in Sydney, and we had a whole menu that wasn\u2019t on the menu. For VIPs.\u201d We all give her a look. \u201cIt never hurts to ask.\u201d</p><p>So I do. I explain, in French that would make Madame Lambert proud, about ma promesse du manger des macarons tous les jours. The waiter listens intently, as though this is serious business and goes into the kitchen. He returns with everyone else\u2019s dessert\u2014cr\u00e8mes br\u00fbl\u00e9e and chocolate mousse\u2014and, miraculously, one perfect creamy macaron just for me. The inside is filled with brown, sweet, gritty paste, figs I think. It\u2019s dusted with powdered sugar so artfully it\u2019s like a painting. I take another picture. Then I eat it.</p><p>By eleven o\u2019clock, I\u2019m falling asleep into my plate. The rest of the group drops me off back at the hostel before going out to hear some French all-girl band play. I fall into a dead sleep and wake up in the morning to discover that Kelly, Nico, and Shazzer are my dorm mates.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cLate! Ten o\u2019clock,\u201d says Kelly. \u201cYou slept ages. And through such a racket. There\u2019s a Russian girl who blow-dries her hair for an hour every day. I waited for you to see if you wanted to come with us. We\u2019re all going to P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery today. We\u2019re going to have a picnic. Which sounds bloody morbid to me, but apparently French people do it all the time.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s tempting: to go with Kelly and her friends and spend my two weeks in Paris being a tourist, having fun. I wouldn\u2019t have to go to dank nightclubs. I wouldn\u2019t have to face C\u00e9line. I wouldn\u2019t have to risk getting my heart broken all over again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll meet up with you later,\u201d I tell her. \u201cI\u2019ve got something to do today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. You\u2019re on an epic quest for macarons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d I say. \u201cThat.\u201d</p><p>At breakfast, I spend a little time with my map, figuring out the route between the hostel and Gare du Nord. It\u2019s walking distance, so I set out. The route seems familiar, the big wide boulevard with the bike paths and sidewalks in the middle. But as I get closer to the station, I start to feel sick to my stomach, the tea I had a while ago coming back to my mouth, all acidic with fear.</p><p>At Gare du Nord, I stall for time. I go in the station. I wander over to the Eurostar tracks. There\u2019s one there, like a horse waiting to leave the gate. I think of when I was here a year ago, broken, scared, running back to Ms. Foley.</p><p>I force myself to leave the station, letting my memory guide me again. I turn. I turn again. I turn once more. Over the train tracks and into the industrial neighborhood. And then, there it is. It\u2019s kind of shocking, after all that searching online, how easy it is to find. I wonder if this one wasn\u2019t listed on Google, or if it was and maybe my French was so mangled that no one understood me.</p><p>Or maybe that\u2019s not it at all. Maybe I was perfectly understood and C\u00e9line and the Giant simply don\u2019t work here anymore. A year is a long time. A lot can change!</p><p>When I open the door and see a younger-looking man with hair in a ponytail behind the bar, I almost cry out in disappointment. Where is the Giant? What if he\u2019s not here? What if she\u2019s not here?</p><p>\u201cExcusez moi, je cherche C\u00e9line ou un barman qui vient du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal.\u201d</p><p>He says nothing. Doesn\u2019t even respond. He just continues washing glasses in soapy water.</p><p>Did I speak? Was it in French? I try again: I add a s\u2019il vous pla\u00eet this time. He gives me a quick look, pulls out his phone, texts something, and then goes back to dishes.</p><p>Con, I mutter in French, another of Nathaniel\u2019s teachings. I shove open the door, adrenaline pushing through me. I\u2019m so angry at that jerk behind the counter who wouldn\u2019t even answer me, at myself, for coming all this way for nothing.</p><p>\u201cYou came back!\u201d</p><p>And I look up. And it\u2019s him.</p><p>\u201cI knew you would come back.\u201d The Giant takes my hand and kisses me on each cheek, just like the last time. \u201cFor the suitcase, non?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m speechless. So I just nod. Then I throw my arms around him. Because I\u2019m so happy to see him again. I tell him so.</p><p>\u201cAs am I. And so happy I save your suitcase. C\u00e9line insist to take it away, but I say no, she will come back to Paris and want her things.\u201d</p><p>I find my voice. \u201cWait, how\u2019d you know I was here? I mean, today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco just text me an American girl was looking for me. I knew it had to be you. Come.\u201d</p><p>I follow him back inside the club, where this Marco is now mopping the floor and refusing to look at me. I have a hard time looking at him after calling him an ass**le in French.</p><p>\u201cJe suis tr\u00e8s d\u00e9sol\u00e9e,\u201d I apologize as I shuffle past him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Latvian. His French is new, so he\u2019s timid to speak,\u201d Yves says. \u201cHe is the cleaner. Come downstairs, that is where your suitcase is.\u201d I glance at Marco and think of Dee, and Shakespeare, and remind myself that things are rarely what they appear. I hope he didn\u2019t understand my French curses, either. I apologize again. The Giant beckons downstairs to the storeroom. In a corner, behind a stack of boxes, is my suitcase.</p><p>Everything is as I left it. The Ziploc with the list. The souvenirs. My travel diary with the bag of blank postcards inside. I half expect it all be covered in a layer of dust. I finger the diary. The souvenirs from last year\u2019s trip. They\u2019re not the memories that matter, the ones that lasted.</p><p>\u201cIt is very nice suitcase,\u201d the Giant says.</p><p>\u201cYou want it?\u201d I ask. I don\u2019t want to lug it around with me. I can ship the souvenirs home. The suitcase is just extra baggage.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no, no. It is for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it. I\u2019ll take the important things, but I can\u2019t carry all this with me.\u201d</p><p>He looks at me seriously. \u201cBut I save it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe saving is the best part, but I really don\u2019t need it anymore.\u201d</p><p>He smiles, the whites of his teeth gleaming. \u201cI am going to Roch\u00e9 Estair in the spring, to celebrate my brother\u2019s graduation.\u201d</p><p>I fish out the important things\u2014my diary, my favorite T-shirt, earrings I\u2019ve missed\u2014and put them in my bag. I put all the souvenirs, the unwritten postcards in a cardboard box to ship home. \u201cYou take this to Roch\u00e9 Estair for the graduation,\u201d I tell him. \u201cIt would make me happy.\u201d</p><p>He nods solemnly. \u201cYou did not come back for your suitcase.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cHave you seen him?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He looks at me for a long moment. He nods again. \u201cOne time. The day after I meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know where I might find him?\u201d</p><p>He strokes the goatee on his chin and looks at me with a sympathy I could really do without. After a long moment, he says, \u201cMaybe you should better speak with C\u00e9line.\u201d</p><p>And the way he says it, it implies all the things I already know. That Willem and C\u00e9line have a history. That I might\u2019ve been right to doubt him all along. But if the Giant knows any of that, he\u2019s not saying. \u201cShe is off today, but sometimes she comes to the shows at night. Androgynie is playing, and she is very good friends with them. I will see if she is coming and let you know. Then you can find out what you need. You can call me later, and I will let you know if she will be here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I pull out my Paris phone, and we exchange numbers. \u201cYou never told me your name, by the way?\u201d</p><p>He laughs at that. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. I am Modou Mjodi. And I never learned your name. I looked on the suitcase but there was nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.

I hadn\u2019t really planned on being a tourist in Paris, but I decide to do it. I brave the Metro and get off in the Marais quarter and go to one of the caf\u00e9s along the beautiful Place des Vosges, where I order a salad and a citron press\u00e9, adding plenty of sugar this time. I sit there for hours, waiting for the waiter to kick me out, but he leaves me alone until I ask for my check. At a patisserie, I get a ridiculously expensive macaron\u2014this one a pale tangerine, like the last whispers of a sunset. I eat it and walk, in and out of the narrow streets, through a lively Jewish section, full of Orthodox men with black hats and stylish skinny suits. I snap a few pictures for my mom and text them to her and tell her to forward them to Grandma, who\u2019ll get a kick out of it. Then I wander around looking at the boutiques, gazing at clothing I can barely afford to touch. When the salesladies ask me in French if I need help, I answer in French that I am just browsing.</p><p>I buy some postcards and go back to Place des Vosges and sit down in the park inside the square. Amid the mothers playing with their babies and the old men reading their newspapers, puffing away on cigarettes, I write them out. I have a lot to send. One to my parents, one to my grandmother, one to Dee, one to Kali, one to Jenn, one to Caf\u00e9 Finlay, one to Carol. And then, at the last minute, I decide to write one to Melanie too.</p><p>It\u2019s kind of a perfect day. I feel totally relaxed, and though I\u2019m undoubtedly a tourist, I also feel like a Parisian. I\u2019m almost relieved that I haven\u2019t heard from Modou. Kelly sends me a text about meeting up for dinner, and I\u2019m getting ready to make my way back to the hostel when my phone chirps. It\u2019s from Modou. C\u00e9line will be at the club after ten o\u2019clock.</p> <p>I feel like the mellow relaxing vibe of the afternoon disappears behind a storm cloud. It\u2019s only seven. I have several hours to kill, and I could go meet the Oz gang for dinner, but I\u2019m too nervous. So, I walk the city in my nervousness. I get to the club at nine thirty and stand outside, the heavy bass thump of live music making my heart pound. She\u2019s probably already there, but it feels like being early is some kind of faux pas. So I linger outside, watching the stylishly edgy Parisians with razored haircuts and angular clothes filter into the club. I look down at myself: khaki skirt, black T-shirt, leather flip-flops. Why didn\u2019t I dress for battle?</p><p>At ten fifteen, I pay my (ten-euro) entry and go in. The club is packed, and there\u2019s a band on the stage, all heavy guitars and a violin screeching feedback, and the tiniest Asian girl singing in this high, squeaky voice. All alone, surrounded by these hipsters, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt so out of place, and every part of me is telling me to leave before I make a fool of myself. But I don\u2019t. I haven\u2019t come this far to chicken out. I fight my way to the bar, and when I see Modou, I greet him like a long-lost brother. He smiles at me and pours me a glass of wine. When I try to pay, he waves the bill away, and immediately, I feel better.</p><p>\u201cAhh, C\u00e9line is there,\u201d he says, pointing to a table up front. She sits, alone, watching the band with a strange intensity, the smoke from her cigarette curling witchily around her.</p><p>I walk over to her table. She doesn\u2019t acknowledge me, though I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s because she\u2019s snubbing me or concentrating on the band. I stand next to the open chair waiting for her to invite me to sit down, but then I just give up. I pull the chair out and sit. She gives me the slightest of nods, takes a puff of the cigarette, and blows smoke all over me, which I suppose counts as a greeting. Then she turns back to the band.</p><p>We sit there, listening. We are sitting right up close to the speakers, so the sound is extra deafening; my ears are already beginning to ring. It\u2019s hard to tell if she\u2019s enjoying the music. She doesn\u2019t tap her toes or sway or anything. She just stares and smokes.</p><p>Finally, when the band takes a break, she looks at me. \u201cYour name is Allyson.\u201d She pronounces it Aleeseesyoohn, which makes it sound ridiculous somehow, an SUV of an American name with too many syllables.</p> <p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cSo, not French at all?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. I never claimed it was.</p><p>We stare at each other, and I realize she won\u2019t give me a thing. I have to take it. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Willem. Do you know where I can find him?\u201d I\u2019d meant to come in guns blazing, French spouting, but my nerves have sent me scurrying back to the comforts of my mother tongue.</p><p>She lights a new cigarette and blows more smoke on me. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, but he said you were good friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that? No. I am just like you.\u201d</p><p>I cannot imagine in what way she would think she is even remotely like me, aside from us both possessing two X chromosomes. \u201cHow, how are we anything alike?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am just one of the girls. There are many of us.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t know this about him. Not like he hid it. But hearing it out loud, from her, I feel exhausted, jet lag dropping me like a plummeting elevator.</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t know where he is?\u201d</p><p>She shakes her head.</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t know where I can find him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd would you even tell me if you did?\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrow goes up into that perfect arch as smoke curls out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cCan you even tell me his last name? Can you tell me that much?\u201d</p><p>And here she smiles. Because in this little game we are playing, have been playing since last summer, I just showed my hand. And what a rotten hand it is. She takes a pen and a scrap of paper and writes something down. She slides the paper over to me. His name is on there. His full name! But I won\u2019t give her the satisfaction of my eagerness, so I casually tuck it in my pocket without even glancing at it.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything else?\u201d Her tone, haughty and gloating, manages to carry over the sounds of the band, who have started playing again. I can already hear her laughing about me with all her hipster pals.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019ve done quite enough.\u201d</p><p>She eyes me for a long second. Her eyes aren\u2019t so much blue as violet. \u201cWhat will you do now?\u201d</p><p>I force a bitchy smile, which I expect doesn\u2019t look bitchy so much as constipated. \u201cOh, you know, see the sights.\u201d</p><p>She blows more smoke on me. \u201cYes, you can be a touriste,\u201d she says, as though tourist were an epithet. Then she begins ticking off all the places lowly people like us go. The Eiffel Tower. Sacr\u00e9-Coeur. The Louvre.</p><p>I search her face for hidden meaning. Did he tell her about our day? I can just picture them laughing about me throwing the book at the skinheads, telling Willem I\u2019d take care of him.</p><p>C\u00e9line is still talking about all the things I can do in Paris. \u201cYou can go shopping,\u201d she is saying. Buy a new handbag. Some jewelry. Another watch. Some shoes. I can\u2019t quite fathom how someone spouting off Ms. Foley\u2013like advice can be so condescending.</p><p>\u201cThank you for your time,\u201d I say. In French. Annoyance has made me bilingual.</p><p>Thirty-one</p><p>Willem de Ruiter.</p><p>His name is Willem de Ruiter. I rush to an Internet caf\u00e9 and start Googling him. But Willem de Ruiter turns out to be a popular name in Holland. There\u2019s a Dutch cinematographer with that name. There\u2019s some famous diplomat with that name. And hundreds of other nonfamous people who nevertheless have some reason to be on the Internet. I go through hundreds of pages, in English, in Dutch, and I find not one link to him, not one piece of evidence that he actually he exists. I Google his parents\u2019 names Bram de Ruiter. Yael de Ruiter. Naturopath. Actor. Anything I can think of. All these combinations. I get vaguely excited when some weird theater thing comes up, but when I click through, the website is down.</p><p>How can it be this hard to find someone? It occurs to me that maybe C\u00e9line intentionally gave me the wrong name.</p><p>But then I Google myself, \u201cAllyson Healey,\u201d and I don\u2019t come up, either. You have to add the name of my college before you get my Facebook page.</p><p>I realize then it\u2019s not enough to know what someone is called.</p><p>You have to know who they are.</p><p>Thirty-two</p><p>The next morning, Kelly and her friends ask me if I want to join them for a trip to the Rodin Museum, followed by some shopping. And I almost say yes. Because that\u2019s what I would like. But there is still one more stop. It\u2019s not even that I think I\u2019ll find anything; it\u2019s just that, if I\u2019m facing down demons, I have go to there too.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure where it is, exactly, but I do know the intersection where Ms. Foley had me picked up. It is seared into my brain. Avenue Simon Bolivar and Rue de l\u2019Equerre, the cross streets of Humiliation and Defeat.</p><p>When I get out of the Metro, nothing seems familiar. Maybe because the last time I was here, I was flipping out in such a panic. But I know I didn\u2019t run that far before finding the pay phone, so I know it can\u2019t be that far to the art squat. I methodically go up one block. Down the next. Up and back. But nothing seems familiar. I attempt to ask directions, but how do you say \u201cart squat\u201d in French? Old building with artists? That doesn\u2019t work. I remember the Chinese restaurants in the vicinity and ask for them. One young guy gets really excited and, I think, offers a recommendation to one supposedly good place across on Rue de Belleville. I find it. And from there, I find a sign for double happiness. It could be one of many, but I have a feeling it\u2019s the one.</p><p>I wander around for fifteen more minutes and, on a quiet triangle of streets, find the squat. It has the same scaffolding, same distorted portraits, maybe a little more weather-beaten. I knock on the steel door. No one answers, but there are obviously people inside. Music wafts out from the open windows. I give the door a push. It creaks open. I push it farther. I walk inside. No one pays me any notice. I go up the creaking staircase, to the place where it all happened.</p><p>I see the clay first, bright white, yet at the same time, golden and warm. Inside, a man is working. He is petite, Asian, a study in contrasts: His hair white with black roots, his clothes all black and strangely antiquated, like he stepped out of a Charles Dickens novel, and all covered in the same white dust that covered me that night.</p><p>He is carving at a piece of clay with a scalpel, his attention so focused I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll startle with the merest sound. I clear my throat and knock quietly on the door.</p><p>He looks up and rubs his eyes, which are bleary with concentration. \u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBonjour,\u201d I begin. And then I sputter. My limited French is no match for what I need to explain to him. I crashed your squat, with a guy. I had the most intimate night of my life, and I woke up utterly alone. \u201cUmm, I\u2019m looking for a friend who I think you might know. Oh, I\u2019m sorry\u2014parlez-vous anglais?\u201d</p><p>He lifts his head and nods, slightly, with the delicacy and control of a ballet dancer. \u201cYes,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a friend of mine, and I wonder if you might know him. His name is Willem de Ruiter. He\u2019s Dutch?\u201d I watch his face for a flicker of recognition, but it remains impassive, as smooth as the clay sculptures that surround us.</p><p>\u201cNo? Well, he and I stayed here one night. Not exactly stayed here . . .\u201d I trail off, looking around the studio, and it all comes back to me: the smell of the rain against the thirsty pavement, the swirl of dust, the smooth wood of his worktable pressing into my back. Willem towering over me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did you say your name was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllyson,\u201d I hear myself say as if from a distance away.</p><p>\u201cVan,\u201d he says, introducing himself while fingering an old pocket watch on a chain.</p><p>I\u2019m staring at the table, remembering the intense sharpness of it against my back, the ease with which Willem hoisted me onto it. The table is, as it was then, meticulously clean, the neat pile of papers, the half-finished pieces in the corner, the mesh cup of charcoals, and pens. Wait, what? I grab for the pens.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s my pen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Van asks.</p><p>I reach over to grab the pen out of the cup. The Rollerball, inscribed BREATHE EASY WITH PULMOCLEAR. \u201cThis is my pen! From my dad\u2019s practice.\u201d</p><p>Van is looking at me, perplexed. But he doesn\u2019t understand. The pen was in my bag. I never took it out. It just went missing. I had it on the barge. I wrote double happiness with it. And then the next day, when I was on the phone with Ms. Foley, it was gone.</p><p>\u201cLast summer, my friend Willem and I, well, we came here hoping someone might put us up for the night. He said that squats will do that.\u201d I pause. Van nods slightly. \u201cBut no one was here. Except a window was open. So we slept here, in your studio, and when I woke up the next morning, my friend, Willem, he was gone.\u201d</p> <p>I wait for Van to get upset about our trespassing, but he is looking at me, still trying to understand why I\u2019m gripping the Pulmoclear pen in my hand like it\u2019s a sword. \u201cThis pen was in my purse and then it was gone and now it\u2019s here, and I\u2019m wondering, maybe there was a note or something. . . .\u201d</p><p>Van\u2019s face remains blank, and I\u2019m about to apologize, for trespassing before, and now again, but then I see something, like the faint glimmers of light before a sunrise, as some sort of recognition illuminates his face. He taps his index finger to the bridge of his nose.</p><p>\u201cI did find something; I thought it was a shopping list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA shopping list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt said something about, about . . . I don\u2019t recall, perhaps chocolate and bread?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChocolate and bread?\u201d Those were Willem\u2019s staple foods. My heart starts to pound.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember. I thought it came in from the garbage. I had been away for holiday, and when I came back, everything was disarrayed. I disposed of it. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He looks stricken.</p><p>We snuck into his studio, made a mess of it, and he looks guilty.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t be sorry. This is so helpful. Would there have been any reason for a shopping list to be in here? I mean, might you have written it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And if I did, it would not have contained bread and chocolate.\u201d</p><p>I smile at that. \u201cCould the list have been, maybe, a note?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were supposed to have bread and chocolate for breakfast. And my pen is here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, take your pen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you can have the pen,\u201d I say, and out escapes a whoop of laughter. A note. Could he have left me a note?</p><p>I throw my arms around Van, who stiffens for a moment in surprise but then relaxes into my embrace and reaches around to hug me back. It feels good, and he smells nice, like oil paint and turpentine and dust and old wood\u2014smells that, like everything from that day, are stitched into the fabric of me now. For the first time in a long time, this doesn\u2019t seem like a curse.</p><p>When I leave Van, it\u2019s mid-afternoon. The Oz crew is probably still at the Rodin Museum; I could meet up with them. But instead, I decide to try something else. I go to the nearest Metro station and close my eyes and spin around and then I pick a stop. I land on Jules Joffrin and then I figure out the series of trains that will take me there.</p><p>I wind up in a very Parisian-seeming neighborhood, lots of narrow, uphill streets and everyday shops: shoe stores, barbershops, little neighborhood bars. I meander a ways, no idea where I am, but surprisingly enjoying the feeling of being lost. Eventually, I come across a broad staircase, carved into the steep hillside, forming a little canyon between the apartment buildings and green foliage hanging down on either side. I have no idea where the stairs lead. I can practically hear Willem\u2019s voice: All the more reason to take them.</p><p>So I do. And take them, and take them. No sooner do I reach one landing than I find another set of stairs. At the top of the stairs, I cross a small cobblestoned medieval street and then, boom, it\u2019s like I\u2019m back in the world of the tour. There are idling coaches and sardine-packed caf\u00e9s, and an accordion player doing Edith Piaf covers.</p><p>I follow the crowds around the corner, and at the end of a street full of caf\u00e9s advertising menus in English, Spanish, French, and German is a huge white-domed cathedral.</p><p>\u201cExcusez-moi, qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est?\u201d I ask a man standing outside of one of the caf\u00e9s.</p><p>He rolls his eyes. \u201cC\u2019est Sacr\u00e9-Coeur!\u201d</p><p>Oh, Sacr\u00e9-Coeur. Of course. I walk closer and see three domes, two smaller ones flanking the big one the middle, reigning regal over the rooftops of Paris. In front of the cathedral, which is glowing golden in the afternoon sun, is a grassy hillside esplanade, bisected by marble staircases leading down the other side of the hill. There are people everywhere: the tourists with their video cameras rolling, backpackers lolling in the sun, artists with easels out, young couples leaning into each other, whispering secrets. Paris! Life!</p><p>At the end of the tour, I\u2019d sworn off setting foot in another moldering old church. But for some reason, I follow the crowds inside. Even with the golden mosaics, looming statues and swelling crowds, it somehow still manages to feel like a neighborhood church, with people quietly praying, fingering rosaries, or just lost in thought.</p><p>There\u2019s a stand of candles, and you can pay a few euros and light one yourself. I\u2019m not Catholic, and I\u2019m not entirely clear on this ritual, but I feel the need to commemorate this somehow. I hand over some change and am given a candle, and when I light it, it occurs to me that I should say a prayer. Should I pray for someone who\u2019s died, like my grandfather? Or should I pray for Dee? For my mom? Should I pray to find Willem?</p><p>But none of that feels right. What feels right is just this. Being here. Again. By myself, this time. I\u2019m not sure what the word for this is, but I say a prayer for it anyway.</p><p>I\u2019m getting hungry, and the long twilight is starting. I decide to go down the back steps into that typical neighborhood and try to find an inexpensive bistro for dinner. But first, I need to get a macaron before all the patisseries close for the day.</p><p>At the base of the steps, I wander for a few blocks before I find a patisserie. At first I think it\u2019s closed because a shade is drawn down the door, but I hear voices, lots and lots of voices, inside, so hesitantly, I push the door open.</p><p>It seems like a party is going on. The air is humid with so many people crammed together, and there are bottles of booze and bouquets of flowers. I begin to edge back out, but there is a huge booming protest from inside, so I open it up again, and they wave me in. Inside, there are maybe ten people, some of them still in bakers\u2019 aprons, others in street clothes. They all have cups in hands, faces flushed with excitement.</p><p>In halting French, I ask if it might be possible to buy a macaron. There is much shuffling, and a macaron is produced. When I reach for my wallet, my money is refused. I start to head for the door, but before I get to it, I\u2019m handed some Champagne in a paper cup. I raise the cup and everyone clinks with me and drinks. Then a burly guy with a handlebar mustache starts to cry and everyone pats him on the back.</p><p>I have no idea what\u2019s going on. I look around questioningly, and one of the women starts talking very fast, in a very strong accent, so I don\u2019t catch much, but I do catch b\u00e9b\u00e9.</p><p>\u201cBaby?\u201d I exclaim in English.</p><p>The guy with the handlebar mustache hands me his telephone. On it is a photo of a puckered, red-faced thing in a blue cap. \u201cR\u00e9my!\u201d he declares.</p><p>\u201cYour son?\u201d I ask. \u201cVotre fils?\u201d</p><p>Handlebar Mustache nods, then his eyes fill with tears.</p><p>\u201cF\u00e9licitations!\u201d I say. And then Handlebar Mustache embraces me in a huge hug, and the crowd claps and cheers.</p><p>A bottle of amber booze is passed around. When all our paper cups have been filled, people hold them up and offer different toasts or just say some version of cheers. Everyone takes a turn, and when it gets to me, I shout out what Jewish people say at times like this: \u201cL\u2019chaim!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means \u2018to life,\u2019\u201d I explain. And as I say it, I think that maybe this is what I was saying a prayer for back in the cathedral. To life.</p><p>\u201cL\u2019chaim,\u201d the rowdy bakers repeat back to me. And then we drink.</p><p>Thirty-three</p><p>The next day, I accept Kelly\u2019s invitation to join the Oz crew. Today they\u2019re going to brave the Louvre. Tomorrow they\u2019re going to Versailles. The day after that, they\u2019re taking the train to Nice. I\u2019m invited to come with them for all of it. I have ten days left on my ticket, and it feels like I\u2019ve found as much as I\u2019m going to find. I found out that he left me a note. Which is almost more than I could\u2019ve hoped for. I am considering going with them to Nice. And, after my wonderful day yesterday, I\u2019m also considering going off on my own somewhere.</p><p>After breakfast, we all get onto the Metro toward the Louvre. Nico and Shazzer are showing off some of their new clothes, which they got from a street market, and Kelly is making fun of them for coming to Paris to buy clothes made in China. \u201cAt least I got something local.\u201d She thrusts out her wrist to show off her new high-tech digital French- manufactured watch. \u201cThere\u2019s this huge store near Vend\u00d4me, all they sell is watches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you need a watch when you\u2019re traveling?\u201d Nick asks.</p><p>\u201cHow many bloody trains have we missed because someone\u2019s phone alarm failed to go off?\u201d</p><p>Nick gives her that one.</p><p>\u201cYou should see this place. It\u2019s bloody enormous. They sell watches from all over; some of them cost a hundred thousand euros. Imagine spending that on a watch,\u201d Kelly goes on, but I\u2019ve stopped listening because I\u2019m suddenly thinking of C\u00e9line. About what she said. About how I could get another watch. Another. Like she knew I lost my last one.</p><p>The Metro is pulling into a station, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I tell Kelly and the gang. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my watch? And where\u2019s Willem?\u201d</p><p>I find C\u00e9line in the club\u2019s office, surrounded by stacks of paperwork, wearing a thick pair of eyeglasses that somehow makes her both more and less intimidating.</p><p>She looks up from her papers, all sleepy-eyed and, maddeningly, unsurprised.</p><p>\u201cYou said I could get another watch, which means you knew Willem had my watch,\u201d I continue.</p><p>I expect her to deny it, to shoot me down. Instead, she gives me a dismissive little shrug. \u201cWhy would you do that? Give him such an expensive watch after one day? It is a little desperate, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs desperate as lying to me?\u201d</p><p>She shrugs again, lazily taps on her computer. \u201cI did not lie. You asked if I knew where to find him. I do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t tell me everything, either. You saw him, after . . . after he, he left me.\u201d</p><p>She does this thing, neither a nod nor a shake of the head, somewhere in between. A perfect expression of ambiguity. A diamond-encrusted stonewall.</p><p>And at just that moment, another one of Nathaniel\u2019s French lessons comes back to me: \u201cT\u2019es toujours aussi salope?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>One eyebrow goes up, but her cigarette goes into the ashtray. \u201cYou speak French now?\u201d she asks, in French.</p><p>\u201cUn petit peu.\u201d A little bit.</p><p>She shuffles the paperwork, stubs out the smoldering cigarette. \u201cIl faut mieux \u00eatre salope que l\u00e2che,\u201d she says. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I have no idea what she said.

But then I remember Madame\u2019s refrain about venturing into the unknown being an act of bravery and her teaching us, as always, the opposite of courageux: l\u00e2che.</p><p>Did C\u00e9line just call me a coward? I feel the indignation travel from the back of my neck up to my ears to the top of my head. \u201cYou can\u2019t call me that,\u201d I sputter in English. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to call me that. You don\u2019t even know me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know enough,\u201d she replies in English. \u201cI know that you forfeited.\u201d Forfeit. I see myself waving a white flag.</p><p>\u201cForfeit? How did I forfeit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou ran away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did the note say?\u201d I am practically screaming now.</p><p>But the more excited I become, the more aloof she becomes. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know something.\u201d</p><p>She lights another cigarette and blows smoke on me. I wave it away. \u201cPlease, C\u00e9line, for a whole year, I\u2019ve assumed the worst, and now I\u2019m wondering if I assumed the wrong worst.\u201d</p> <p>More silence. Then \u201cHe had the, how do you say it, sue-tours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSue-tours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike with sewing on skin.\u201d She points to her cheek.</p><p>\u201cSutures? Stitches? He had stitches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and his face was very swollen, and his eye black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe would not tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me this yesterday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did not ask me this yesterday.\u201d</p><p>I want to be furious with her. Not just for this, but for being such a bitch that first day in Paris, for accusing me of cowardice. But I finally get that none of this is about C\u00e9line; it never was. I\u2019m the one who told Willem I was in love with him. I\u2019m the one who said that I\u2019d take care of him. I\u2019m the one who bailed.</p><p>I look up at C\u00e9line, who is watching me with the cagey expression of a cat eyeing a sleeping dog. \u201cJe suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9e,\u201d I apologize. And then I pull the macaron out of my bag and give it to her. It\u2019s raspberry, and I was saving it as a reward for confronting C\u00e9line. It is cheating Babs\u2019s rule to give it to someone else, but somehow, I feel she\u2019d approve.</p><p>She eyes it suspiciously, then takes it, pinching it between her fingers as though it were contagious. She gingerly lays it on a stack of CD cases.</p><p>\u201cSo, what happened?\u201d I ask. \u201cHe came back here all banged up?\u201d</p><p>She nods, barely.</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>She frowns. \u201cHe would not say.\u201d</p><p>Silence. She looks down, then quickly glances at me. \u201cHe looked through your suitcase.\u201d</p><p>What was in there? A packing list. Clothes. Souvenirs. Unwritten postcards. My luggage tag? No, that snapped off in the Tube station back in London. My diary? Which I now have. I grab it out of my bag, leaf through a few entries. There\u2019s something about Rome and feral cats. Vienna and the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace. The opera in Prague. But there is nothing, nothing of me. Not my name. My address. My email address. Not the addresses of any of the people I met on the tour. We didn\u2019t even bother with the pretense of keeping in touch. I shove the diary back in my bag. C\u00e9line is peering through narrowed eyes, watching while pretending not to.</p><p>\u201cDid he take anything from my bag? Find anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He only smelled. . . .\u201d She stops, as if in pain.</p><p>\u201cHe smelled what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe smelled terrible,\u201d she says solemnly. \u201cHe took your watch. I told him to leave it. My uncle is a jeweler, so I know it was expensive. But he refused.\u201d</p><p>I sigh. \u201cWhere can I find him, C\u00e9line? Please. You can help me with that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat much? I help you with so much already,\u201d she says, all huffy with her own indignation. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know where to find him. I don\u2019t lie.\u201d She looks hard at me. \u201cI tell you the truth, and that is that Willem is the kind of man who comes when he comes. And mostly, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I wish I could tell her that she\u2019s wrong. That with us, it was different. But if he didn\u2019t stay in love with C\u00e9line, what makes me think that after one day, even if he did like me, I haven\u2019t been completely licked clean?</p><p>\u201cSo you did not have any luck? On the Internet?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I start to gather my things. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWillem de Ruiter is a common name, n\u2019est-ce pas?\u201d she says. Then she does something I wouldn\u2019t have thought her capable of. She blushes. And that is how I know she\u2019s looked for him too. And she didn\u2019t find him, either. And all at once, I wonder if I haven\u2019t gotten C\u00e9line, if not altogether wrong, then a little bit wrong.</p><p>I take one of my extra Paris postcards. I write my name, address, all my details on it, and hand it to her. \u201cIf you see Willem. Or if you\u2019re ever in Boston and need a place to crash\u2014or store your stuff.\u201d</p><p>She takes the postcard and looks at it. Then she shoves it in a drawer. \u201cBoss-tone. I think I prefer New York,\u201d she sniffs. I\u2019m almost relieved that she\u2019s sounding like her haughty self again.</p><p>I think of Dee. He could handle C\u00e9line. \u201cThat can probably be arranged.\u201d</p><p>When I get to the door, C\u00e9line calls out my name. I turn around. I see that she\u2019s taken a bite of the macaron, the round cookie now a half moon.</p><p>\u201cI am sorry I called you a coward,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d I say. \u201cI am sometimes. But I\u2019m trying to be braver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBon.\u201d She pauses, and if I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d think she maybe almost was considering a smile. \u201cIf you find Willem again, you will need to be brave.\u201d</p><p>I go sit down on the edge of a fountain to consider what C\u00e9line said. I can\u2019t quite make out if it was meant in support or warning, or maybe both. But it all seems academic, anyhow, because I\u2019ve reached a dead end. She doesn\u2019t know where he is. I can try some more Internet searching and send another letter to Guerrilla Will, but other than that, I\u2019m tapped.</p><p>You will need to be brave.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s all for the best. Maybe I end here. Tomorrow I will go to Versailles with the Oz crew. And that feels okay. I pull out the map Dee and Sandra gave me to plot my route back to the hostel. It\u2019s not too far. I can walk. I trace the route with my finger. When I do, my finger runs over not one but two big pink squares. The big pink squares on this map are hospitals. I pull the map closer to my face. There are pink squares all over the place. Paris is crazy with hospitals. I run my finger to the art squat. There are several hospitals within a thumb\u2019s width of the squat too.</p><p>If Willem got hurt near the art squat, and he got stitches, there\u2019s a good chance it happened at one of these hospitals. \u201cThank you, Dee!\u201d I call out into the Paris afternoon. \u201cAnd thank you, C\u00e9line,\u201d I add a bit more quietly. And then I get up and go.</p><p>The next day, Kelly greets me coolly, which I can tell is hard work for her. I apologize for going MIA yesterday.</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay,\u201d she says, \u201cbut you\u2019re coming with us today to Versailles?\u201d</p><p>I grimace. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her face hardens into hurt. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to hang with us, it\u2019s fine, but don\u2019t make plans to spare our feelings.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure why I haven\u2019t told her. It feels sort of silly, being over here, going to all this trouble, for a guy I knew for a day. But as I tell Kelly a short version of the long story, including today\u2019s mad quest, her face grows serious. When I\u2019m done, she just gives a little nod of her head. \u201cI understand,\u201d she says solemnly. \u201cI\u2019ll see you down at brekkie.\u201d</p><p>When I get down to the breakfast room, Kelly and the group are huddled around one of the big wooden tables, maps spread out in front of them. I take my croissant and tea and yogurt and join them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re coming with you,\u201d she declares. \u201cAll of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you need an army for this.\u201d The rest of the group sloppy salute me, and then they all start talking at once. Very loudly. People look over at us, but these guys are irrepressible. Only the pale petite girl at the edge of our table ignores us, keeping her nose in a book.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you guys want to miss Versailles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVersailles is a relic,\u201d Kelly insists. \u201cIt\u2019s not going anywhere. But this is real life. Real romance. What could be more French than that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re coming with you, like it or not. If we have to follow you to every French hospital between here and Nice,\u201d Shazzer says.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019ll be necessary,\u201d I say \u201cI\u2019ve looked on the map. I\u2019ve narrowed it down to three likely hospitals.\u201d</p><p>The elfin girl looks up. Her eyes are so pale they seem to be made of water. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but did you say you were going to a hospital?\u201d she asks.</p><p>I look at the Australians, my ragtag army, all of them gung ho. \u201cApparently so.\u201d</p><p>The elfin girl looks at me with a weird intensity. \u201cI know hospitals,\u201d she says in a quiet voice.</p><p>I look back at her. Really, I can\u2019t think of anything more boring than this, except maybe a visit to a French unemployment office. I can\u2019t imagine that she would want to come along. Except maybe she\u2019s lonely. And that I understand.</p><p>\u201cDo you, do you want to go with us?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNot particularly,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think I should.\u201d</p><p>The first hospital on the map turns out to some sort of private hospital, where, after an hour of being sent from one office to the next, we find out that, while there is an emergency room, it does not take most cases off the street, but rather sends them to the public hospitals. They send us to H\u00f4pital Lariboisi\u00e8re. We head straight for the urgences, the French version of the emergency room, and after being given a number and told to wait, we sit for ages in uncomfortable chairs, along with all the people with broken elbows and coughs that sound really ugly and contagious.</p><p>The initial enthusiasm of the group starts to flag when they realize that going to an emergency room is as boring in France as it is anywhere else. They are reduced to entertaining themselves with spitballs and card games of War, which does not endear the nurses to them. Wren, the strange, pale, pixie girl we\u2019ve picked up, participates in none of the silliness. She just keeps reading her book.</p><p>By the time we are called to the front counter, the nurses are hating us, and the feeling is pretty much mutual. Shazzer, who apparently speaks the best French, is anointed ambassador, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s her French skills or her diplomatic ones that are lacking, but within five minutes, she is heatedly arguing with the nurse, and within ten, we are being escorted to the street.</p><p>It\u2019s now three o\u2019clock. The day is half gone, and I can see the group is antsy, tired, hungry, wishing that they\u2019d gone to Versailles. And now that I think about it, I realize how ridiculous this is. The front desk at my father\u2019s practice is manned by a nurse named Leona, who won\u2019t let even me go back into the office unless my father is in there and waiting for me. Leona would never give out a record to me\u2014her boss\u2019s daughter, who speaks the same language as she does\u2014let alone a foreign stranger.</p><p>\u201cThat was a bust,\u201d I tell them when we come out onto the pavement. The cloud layer that has been sitting over Paris for the last few days has burned off while we were waiting inside, and the day has turned hot and clear. \u201cAt least you can salvage the rest of the afternoon. Get some food and have a picnic in the Luxembourg Gardens.\u201d</p><p>I can see the idea is tempting. No one rebuffs it. \u201cBut we promised we\u2019d be your wingmen,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cWe can\u2019t let you do this alone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I hold up my hands in surrender. \u201cYou\u2019re not. I\u2019m done. This is a lost cause.\u201d</p><p>Maps are taken out. Metro routes are debated. Picnic items are discussed.</p><p>\u201cPeople mix up their patron saints, you know?\u201d I look up. Wren, our pixie tagalong, who has been all but silent all day, has finally spoken.</p><p>\u201cThey do?\u201d</p> <p>She nods. \u201cSaint Anthony is the patron saint of lost things. But Saint Jude is the patron saint of lost causes. You have to make sure you ask the right saint for help.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a moment as everyone looks at Wren. Is she some kind of religious nut?</p><p>\u201cWho would be in charge of a lost person?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Wren stops to consider. \u201cThat would depend. What kind of lost?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s lost at all. Maybe he\u2019s exactly where he wants to be. Maybe I\u2019m the lost one, chasing someone who has no desire to be found. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p> <p>Wren twirls her bracelet, fingering the charms. \u201cPerhaps you should just pray to both.\u201d She shows me the little charms with each patron saint. There are many more charms, one with a date, another with a clover, one with a bird.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m Jewish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they don\u2019t care.\u201d Wren looks up at me. Her eyes don\u2019t seem blue so much as the absence of blue. Like the sky just before dawn. \u201cYou should ask the saints for help. And you should go to that third hospital.\u201d</p><p>H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis turns out to be a four-hundred-year-old hospital. Wren and I make our way into the modern wing that sits adjacent. I\u2019ve sent the others on to Luxembourg Gardens without much of an argument. Sunlight filters in through the glass atrium, throwing prisms of light onto the floor.</p><p>It\u2019s quiet in the ER, only a few people sitting among rows of empty chairs. Wren goes right up to the two male nurses behind the desk and that weirdly mellifluous voice of hers breaks out in perfect French. I stand behind her, catching enough of what she says to get that she is telling my story, mesmerizing them with it. Even the people in the chairs are leaning in to hear her quiet voice. I have no idea how Wren even knows the story; I didn\u2019t tell her. Maybe she picked it up at breakfast or among the others. She finishes, and there is silence. The nurses stare at her, then look down and start typing.</p><p>\u201cHow do you speak French so well?\u201d I whisper.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m from Quebec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you translate at the other hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t the right one.\u201d</p><p>The nurses ask me his name. I say it. I spell it. I hear the tap of the computer keys as they input it.</p><p>\u201cNon,\u201d one nurse says. \u201cPas ici.\u201d He shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cAttendez,\u201d the other says. Wait.</p><p>He types some more. He says a bunch of things to Wren, and I lose track, but then one phrase floats to the top: a date. The day after the day Willem and I spent together. The day we got separated.</p><p>My breath stops. He looks up, repeats the date to me.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. That would\u2019ve been when he was here. \u201cOui.\u201d</p><p>The nurse says something and something else I don\u2019t understand. I turn to Wren. \u201cCan they tell us how to find him?\u201d</p><p>Wren asks a questions, then translates back. \u201cThe records are sealed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they don\u2019t have to give us anything written. They must have something on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey say it\u2019s all in the billing department now. They don\u2019t keep much here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has to be something. Now\u2019s the time to ask Saint Jude for help.\u201d</p><p>Wren fingers the charm on her bracelet. A pair of doctors in scrubs and lab coats come through the double doors, coffee cups in hand. Wren and I look at each other, Saint Jude apparently deciding to bestow twin inspiration.</p><p>\u201cCan I speak to a doctor?\u201d I ask the nurses in my horrible French. \u201cMaybe the . . .\u201d I turn to Wren. \u201cHow do you say \u2018attending physician\u2019 in French? Or the doctor who treated Willem?\u201d</p><p>The nurse must understand some English because he rubs his chin and goes back to the computer. \u201cAhh, Dr. Robinet,\u201d he says, and picks up a phone. A few minutes later, a pair of double doors swing open, and it\u2019s like this time Saint Jude decided to send us a bonus, because the doctor is TV-handsome: curly salt-and-pepper hair, a face that\u2019s both delicate and rugged. Wren starts to explain the situation, but then I realize that, lost cause or not, I have to make my own case. In the most labored French imaginable, I attempt to explain: Friend hurt. At this hospital. Lost friend. Need to find. I\u2019m frazzled, and with my bare-basics phrases, I must sound like a cavewoman.</p><p>Dr. Robinet looks at me for a while. Then he beckons for us to follow him through the double doors into an empty examination room, where he gestures for us to sit on the table while he settles on a rolling stool.</p><p>\u201cI understand your dilemma,\u201d he replies in perfect British-accented English. \u201cBut we can\u2019t just give out files about a patient.\u201d He turns to look directly at me. His eyes are bright green, both sharp and kind. \u201cI understand you\u2019ve come all the way from America, but I am sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you at least tell me what happened to him? Without actually looking into his chart? Would that be breaking protocol?\u201d</p><p>Dr. Robinet smiles patiently. \u201cI see dozens of patients a day. And this was, you say, a year ago?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYes.\u201d I bury my head in my hands. The folly of it hits me anew. One day. One year.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps if you described him.\u201d Dr. Robinet feeds me some rope.</p><p>I snatch it up. \u201cHe was Dutch. Very tall, six foot three\u2014it\u2019s one point nine in metric. Seventy-five kilos. He had very light hair, almost like straw, but very dark eyes, almost like coals. He was skinny. His fingers were long. He had a scar, like a zigzag, right on the top of his foot.\u201d As I continue to describe him, details I thought I\u2019d forgotten come back to me, and an image of him emerges.</p><p>But Dr. Robinet can\u2019t see it. He looks puzzled, and I realize that from his point of view, I\u2019ve described a tall blond guy, one person among thousands.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps if you had a photograph?\u201d</p><p>I feel as if the image I\u2019ve created of Willem is alive in the room. He\u2019d been right about not needing a camera to record the important things. He\u2019d been there inside me all this time.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cOh, but he had stitches. And a black eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat describes a majority of the people we treat,\u201d Dr. Robinet says. \u201cI am very sorry.\u201d He stands up off the stool; something clinks to the ground. Wren retrieves a euro coin off the floor and starts to hand it back to him.</p><p>\u201cWait! He did this thing with coins,\u201d I say. \u201cHe could balance a coin along his knuckles. Like this. May I?\u201d I reach out for the euro and show how he flipped a coin across his knuckles.</p><p>I hand Dr. Robinet back his euro, and he holds it in his hand, examining it as if it were a rare coin. Then he flips it up in the air and catches it. \u201cCommotion c\u00e9r\u00e9brale!\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcussion!\u201d Wren translates.</p><p>\u201cConcussion?\u201d</p><p>He holds up his index finger and turns it around slowly, like he\u2019s spooling information from a deep well. \u201cHe had a concussion. And if I recall, a facial laceration. We wanted him to stay for observation\u2014concussions can be serious\u2014and we wanted to report it to the police because he\u2019d been assaulted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssaulted? Why? By whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know. It is customary to file a police report, but he refused. He was very agitated. I remember now! He wouldn\u2019t stay beyond a few hours. He wanted to leave straight away, but we insisted he stay for a CT scan. But as soon as we stitched him up and saw there was no cerebral bleeding, he insisted he had to go. He said it was very important. Someone he was going to lose.\u201d He turns to me, his eyes huge now. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Wren says.</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d I say. Black spots dance in my vision, and my head feels liquid.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s going to faint,\u201d Wren says.</p><p>\u201cPut your head between your legs,\u201d Dr. Robinet advises. He calls out into the hall, and a nurse brings me a glass of water. I drink it. The world stops spinning. Slowly, I sit back up. Dr. Robinet is looking at me now, and it\u2019s like the shade of professionalism has dropped.</p><p>\u201cBut this was a year ago,\u201d he asks in a blanket-soft voice. \u201cYou lost each other a year ago?\u201d</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been looking all this time?\u201d</p><p>I nod again. In some way, I have.</p><p>\u201cAnd do you think he\u2019s been looking for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d And I don\u2019t. Just because he tried to find me a year ago doesn\u2019t me he wants to find me now. Or wants me to find him.</p><p>\u201cBut you must know,\u201d he replies. And for a minute I think he\u2019s reprimanding me that I ought to know, but then he picks up the phone and makes a call. When he\u2019s done, he turns to me. \u201cYou must know,\u201d he repeats. \u201cGo to window two in the billing office now. They cannot release his chart, but I have instructed them to release his address.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have it? They have his address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have an address. Go collect it now. And then find him.\u201d He looks at me again. \u201cNo matter what, you must know.\u201d</p><p>I walk out of the hospital, past where the cancer patients are taking their chemotherapy treatments in the late afternoon sun. The printout with Willem\u2019s address is clenched in my fist. I haven\u2019t looked at it yet. I tell Wren that I need a moment alone and make my way toward the old hospital walls.</p><p>I sit down on a bench alongside the quadrangle of grass, between the old brick buildings. Bees dance between the flower bushes, and children play\u2014there\u2019s so much life in these old hospital walls. I look at the paper in my hand. It could have any address. He could be anywhere in the world. How far am I willing to take this?</p><p>I think of Willem, beaten\u2014beaten!\u2014and still trying to find me. I take a deep breath. The smell of fresh-cut grass mingles with pollen and the fumes from trucks idling on the street. I look at the birthmark on my wrist.</p><p>I open the paper, not sure where I\u2019m going next, only sure that I\u2019m going.</p><p>Thirty-four</p><p>AUGUST</p><p>Utrecht, Holland</p><p>My guidebook has all of two pages on Utrecht, so I expect it to be tiny or ugly or industrial, but it turns out to be a gorgeous, twisting medieval city full of gabled row houses and canals with houseboats, and tiny little alley streets that look like they might house humans or might house dolls. There aren\u2019t many youth hostels, but when I turn up at the only one I can afford, I learn that before it was a hostel, it was a squat. And I get that sense, almost like a radar communicating from some secret part of the world just to me: Yes, this is where you\u2019re meant to be.</p><p>The guys at the youth hostel are friendly and helpful and speak perfect English, just like Willem did. One of them even looks like him\u2014that same angular face, those puffy red lips. I actually ask him if he knows Willem; he doesn\u2019t and when I explain that he looks like someone I\u2019m looking for, he laughs and says he and half of Holland. He gives me a map of Utrecht and shows me how to get to the address the hospital gave me, a few kilometers from here, and suggests I rent a bike.</p><p>I opt for the bus. The house is out of the center, in an area full of record stores, ethnic restaurants with meat turning on spits, and graffiti. After a couple of wrong turns, I find the street, opposite some railroad tracks, on which sits an abandoned freight car, almost completely graffitied over. Right across the street is a skinny town house, which according to my printout, is the last known address of Willem de Ruiter.</p><p>I have to push my way past six bikes locked to the front rail to get to the door, which is painted electric blue. I hesitate before pressing the doorbell, which looks like an eyeball. I feel strangely calm as I press. I hear the ring. Then the heavy clump of feet. I\u2019ve only known Willem for a day, but I recognize that those are not his footsteps. His would be lighter, somehow. A pretty, tall girl with a long brown braid opens the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHi. Do you speak English?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she answers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Willem de Ruiter. I\u2019m told he lives here.\u201d I hold up the piece of paper as if in proof.</p><p>Somehow I knew he wasn\u2019t here. Maybe because I wasn\u2019t nervous enough. So when her expression doesn\u2019t register, I\u2019m not all that surprised. \u201cI don\u2019t know him. I\u2019m just renting here for the summer,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She starts to close the door.</p> <p>By now, I\u2019ve learned no or sorry or I can\u2019t help you\u2014these are opening offers. \u201cIs there someone else here who might know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaskia,\u201d she calls. From the top of a stairway so narrow it looks like a ladder, a girl appears. She climbs down. She has blond hair and rosy cheeks and blue eyes, and there\u2019s something vaguely farm-fresh about her, as though she just this minute finished riding a horse or plowing a field, even though her hair is cut in spikes and she\u2019s dressed in a woven black sweater that is anything but traditional.</p><p>Once again I explain that I\u2019m looking for Willem de Ruiter. Then, even though she doesn\u2019t know me, Saskia invites me in and offers me a cup of coffee or tea.</p><p>The three of us sit down at a messy wooden table, piled high with stacks of magazines and envelopes. There are clothes strewn everywhere. It\u2019s clear a lot of people live here. But apparently not Willem.</p><p>\u201cHe never really lived here,\u201d Saskia explains after she serves me tea and chocolates.</p> <p>\u201cBut you know him?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met him a few times. I was friends with Lien, who was the girlfriend of one of Robert-Jan\u2019s friends. But I don\u2019t really know Willem. Like Anamiek, I just moved in over the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know why he would use this as his address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably because of Robert-Jan,\u201d Saskia says.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Robert-Jan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe goes to the University of Utrecht, same as me. He used to live here,\u201d Saskia explains. \u201cBut he moved out. I took over his room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you did,\u201d I mutter to myself.</p><p>\u201cIn student houses, people come and go. But Robert-Jan will be back to Utrecht. Not here but to a new flat. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t know where that will be. I just took over his room.\u201d She shrugs as if to say, that\u2019s all.</p><p>I drum my fingers on the old wooden table. I look at the pile of mail. \u201cDo you think maybe I could look through the mail? See if there\u2019s anything with a clue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Saskia says.</p><p>I go through the piles. They are mostly bills and magazines and catalogs, addressed to various people who live or have lived at this address. I count at least a half dozen names, including Robert-Jan. But Willem doesn\u2019t have a single piece of mail.</p><p>\u201cDid Willem ever get mail here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere used to be some,\u201d Saskia replies. \u201cBut someone organized the mail a few days ago, so maybe they threw his away. Like I said, he hasn\u2019t been around in months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Anamiek says. \u201cI think I saw some new mail with his name on it. It\u2019s still in the box by the door.\u201d</p> <p>She returns with an envelope. This one isn\u2019t junk mail. It\u2019s a letter, with the address handwritten. The stamps are Dutch. I want to find him, but not enough to open his personal correspondence. I put the envelope down on the piles, but then I double-take. Because the return address in the upper left-hand corner, written in a swirling unfamiliar script, is mine.</p><p>I take the envelope and hold it up to the lamp. There\u2019s another envelope inside. I open the outer envelope and out of that spills my letter, the one I sent to Guerrilla Will in En-gland, looking for Willem. From the looks of the stamps and crossed-out addresses and tape on the envelope, it\u2019s been forwarded a few times. I open up the original letter to see if anyone has added anything to it, but they haven\u2019t. It\u2019s just been read and passed on.</p><p>Still, I feel overjoyed somehow. All this time, my scrappy little letter has been trying to find him too. I want to kiss it for its tenacity.</p><p>I show the letter to Saskia and Anamiek. They read it and look at me confused. \u201cI wrote this letter,\u201d I say. \u201cFive months ago. When I first tried to find him. I sent it to an address in England, and somehow it found its way here. Same as me.\u201d As I say it, I get that sense again. I\u2019m on the right path. My letter and I landed in the same place, even if it\u2019s the wrong place.</p><p>Saskia and Anamiek look at each other.</p><p>\u201cWe will make some calls,\u201d Saskia says. \u201cWe can certainly help you find Robert-Jan.\u201d</p><p>The girls disappear up the stairs. I hear a computer chime on. I hear the sounds of one-sided conversations, Saskia on the phone. About twenty minutes later, they come back down. \u201cIt\u2019s August, so almost everyone is away, but I am sure I can get you contact information for Robert-Jan in a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I say.</p><p>Her eyes flicker up. I don\u2019t like the way they look at me. \u201cThough I might have found a faster way to find Willem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What?\u201d</p><p>She hesitates. \u201cHis girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-five</p><p>Ana Lucia Aureliano. That\u2019s her name. Willem\u2019s girlfriend. She goes to some honors college connected to the University of Utrecht.</p><p>In all the time I\u2019ve been looking, I never dreamed of getting this far. So I didn\u2019t let myself imagine actually finding him. And while I have imagined him having lots of girls, I hadn\u2019t thought of him having just one. Which, in retrospect, seems awfully stupid.</p><p>It\u2019s not like I\u2019m here to get back together. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s a together to get back to. But if I came this close, only to leave, I think I\u2019d regret it for the rest of my life.</p><p>Ironically, it\u2019s C\u00e9line\u2019s words that finally convince me to go find the girlfriend: You will need to be brave.</p><p>University College\u2019s campus is small and self-contained, unlike the University of Utrecht, which sprawls through the city center, Saskia explained. It\u2019s on the outskirts of town, and as I ride out there on a pink bike that Saskia insisted I borrow, I practice what I\u2019m going to say if I find her. Or find him.</p><p>The school has very few students, and they all live on campus, and it\u2019s also an international school, drawing students from all over the world, with all the classes taught in English. Which means it only takes asking two people about Ana Lucia before I\u2019m given directions to her dorm.</p><p>A dorm that seems less like a college residence than an IKEA showroom. I peer inside the sliding-glass door; it\u2019s all sleek wood and modern furniture, a million miles away from the industrial blah of the room I shared with Kali. The lights are out, and when I knock, no one answers. There\u2019s a little cement landing outside the door that has some embroidered cushions, so I sit down and wait.</p><p>I must have dozed off because I wake up falling backward. Someone has opened the door behind me. I look up. The girl\u2014Ana Lucia, I assume\u2014is beautiful, with long wavy brown hair and rosebud lips, accentuated with red lipstick. Between her and C\u00e9line, I should feel flattered to be in such company, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m feeling at the moment.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d she asks, hovering over me, eyeing me as you might eye a vagrant you caught sleeping on your stoop.</p><p>The sun has come out from behind the clouds and it reflects off the glass window, creating a glare. I shield my eyes with my hands and heave myself up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I must\u2019ve fallen asleep. I\u2019m looking for Ana Lucia Aureliano.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ana Lucia,\u201d she says, emphasizing the correct pronunciation with the strength of her Spanish lisp: Ana Lu-thee-uh. She squints her eyes, studying me. \u201cHave we met before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I\u2019m Allyson Healey. I\u2019m . . . I\u2019m sorry. This is weird. I\u2019m from America, and I\u2019m trying to find someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this your first term here? There is an online student directory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, no. I don\u2019t go here. I go to school in Boston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you search for?\u201d</p><p>I almost don\u2019t want to say his name. I could make up a name and then she\u2019d be none the wiser. I wouldn\u2019t have to hear her ask in that adorable accent of hers why I want to know where her boyfriend is. But then I would go home, and I\u2019d have come this far and would never know. So I say it.</p><p>\u201cWillem de Ruiter.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me for a long moment and then her pretty face puckers, her cosmetic-ad lips part. And then out of those perfect lips comes a spew of what I assume is invective. I can\u2019t be sure. It\u2019s in Spanish. But she\u2019s waving her arms and talking a mile a minute, and her face has gone red. Vate! D\u00e9jame, puta! And then she picks me up by my shoulders and throws me off the stoop, like a bouncer ejecting a drunk. She throws my backpack after me, so that everything spills out. Then she slams the door shut, as much as you can slam a sliding-glass door. Locks it. And draws the shades.</p><p>I sit there agape for a moment. Then, in a daze, I start putting my things back in my bag. I examine my elbow, which has a scrape from where I landed, and my arm, which bears the half-moons of her nail marks.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I look up and see a pretty girl with dreadlocks who has bent down beside me and is handing me my sunglasses.</p><p>I nod.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need ice or anything? I have some in my room.\u201d She starts to walk back to her stoop.</p><p>I touch my head. There\u2019s a bump there too, but nothing serious. \u201cI think I\u2019m okay. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>She looks at me and shakes her head. \u201cYou were not, by any chance, asking about Willem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know him?\u201d I ask. \u201cYou know Willem?\u201d I come over to her stoop. There\u2019s a laptop and a textbook sitting there. It\u2019s a physics book. She has it open to the section on quantum entanglement.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen him around. This is only my second year, so I didn\u2019t know him when he went here. But only one person makes Ana Lucia crazy like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Here? He went to college? Here?\u201d I try to reconcile the Willem I met, the itinerant traveling actor, with an honors college student, and it hits me again how little I know this person.</p><p>\u201cFor one year. Before I got here. He studied economics, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d I meant with the college, but she starts telling me about Ana Lucia. About how she and Willem got back together last year but then how she found out that he\u2019d been cheating on her with some French girl the whole time. She\u2019s very casual about it, like none of it is all that surprising.</p><p>But my head is reeling. Willem went here. He studied economics. So it takes a minute to finally digest the last part. The cheating-on-Ana-Lucia-with-a-French-girl part.</p><p>\u201cA French girl?\u201d I repeat.</p><p>\u201cYes. Apparently, Willem was going to meet her for some secret tryst, in Spain, I think. Ana Lucia saw him shopping for flights on her computer, and thought he was planning to take her as a surprise because she has relatives there. So she canceled her vacation to Switzerland, and then told her family all about it, and they planned a big party, only to discover that the tickets were never for her. They were for the French girl. She freaked out, confronted him right in the middle of the campus\u2014it was quite a scene. He hasn\u2019t been around since, obviously. Are you sure you don\u2019t need some ice for your head?\u201d</p><p>I sink onto the stoop next to her. C\u00e9line? But she claimed she hadn\u2019t seen him since last year. But then she\u2019d said a lot of things. Including that we were both just ports that Willem visited. Maybe there were a bunch of us out there. A French girl. Or two or three. A Spaniard. An American. A whole United Nations of girls waving from their ports. I think of C\u00e9line\u2019s parting words to me, and now they seem ominous.</p><p>I always knew that Willem was a player and that I was one of many. But now I also know that he didn\u2019t ditch me that day. He wrote me a note. He tried, however halfheartedly, to find me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I think of what my mom said. About being grateful for what you have instead of yearning for what you think you want. Standing here, on the campus where he once walked, I think I finally get what she was talking about. I think I finally understand what it truly means to quit while you\u2019re ahead.</p><p>Thirty-six</p><p>Amsterdam</p><p>Forward momentum. That\u2019s my new motto. No regrets. And no going back.</p> <p>I cancel the Paris-London portion of my flight home so I can fly home straight from London. I don\u2019t want to go back to Paris. I want to go somewhere else. I have five more days in Europe, and there are all these low-cost airlines. I could go to Ireland. Or Romania. I could take a train to Nice and hook up with the Oz crew. I could go anywhere.</p><p>But to get to any of those places, I have to go to Amsterdam. So that\u2019s where I\u2019m going first. On the pink bike.</p><p>When I went to deliver the bike to Saskia, along with a box of chocolates to say thank you, I told her that I didn\u2019t need her to find me Robert-Jan\u2019s contact information.</p><p>\u201cYou found what you needed?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes and no.\u201d</p> <p>She seemed to understand. She took the chocolates but told me to keep the bike. It didn\u2019t belong to anyone, and I\u2019d need it in Amsterdam, and I could take it with me on the train or pass it along to someone else.</p><p>\u201cThe pink White Bicycle,\u201d I said.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou know about the White Bicycle?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cI wish it still existed.\u201d</p><p>I thought about my travels, about all the things that people had passed on to me: friendship, help, ideas, encouragement, macarons. \u201cI think it still does,\u201d I told her.</p> <p>Anamiek has written me instructions on biking from Utrecht to Amsterdam. It\u2019s only twenty-five miles, and there are bike paths the whole, flat way. Once I get to the eastern end of the city, I\u2019ll hook up with the tram line nine, and I can just follow that all the way to Centraal Station, which is where most of the budget youth hostels are.</p><p>Once out of Utrecht, the landscape turns industrial and then to farms. Cows lolling in green fields, big stone windmills\u2014I even catch a farmer in clogs. But it doesn\u2019t take long for the bucolic to meld with office parks and then I\u2019m on the outskirts of Amsterdam, going past a huge stadium that says Ajax and then the bike path dumps me onto the street and things get a little confusing. I hear the bring-bring of a tram, and it\u2019s the number nine, just as Anamiek promised. I follow it up the long stretches past the Oosterpark and what I assume is the zoo\u2014a flock of pink flamingos in the middle of the city\u2014but then things get a little confusing at an intersection by a big flea market and I lose the tram. Behind me, motos are beeping, and the traffic of bicycles seems twice that of cars, and I keep trying to find the tram, but the canals all seem to go in circles, each one looking like the last, with tall stone banks and every kind of boat\u2014from houseboat to rowboat to glass-domed tour boat\u2014on its brackish waters. I pass by improbably skinny gabled row houses and cozy little caf\u00e9s, doors flung open to reveal walls a hundred years\u2019 worth of brown. I turn right and wind up at a flower market, the colorful blooms popping in the gray morning.</p><p>I pull out my map and turn it around. This whole city seems to turn in circles, and the names of the streets read like all the letters in the alphabet got into a car accident: Oudezijds Voorburgwal. Nieuwebrugsteeg. Completely lost, I pedal up next to a tall guy in a leather jacket who\u2019s strapping a blond toddler into a bike seat. When I see his face, I do another double take because he\u2019s another, albeit older, Willem clone.</p><p>I ask him for directions, and he has me follow him to Dam Square and from there points me around the dizzying traffic circle to the Warmoesstraat. I pedal up a street full of sex shops, brazen with their lurid window displays. At the end of the block is one of the city\u2019s cheaper youth hostels.</p><p>The lobby is boisterous with activity: people are playing pool and Ping-Pong, and there\u2019s a card game going, and everyone seems to have a beer in hand, even though it\u2019s barely lunchtime. I ask for a dormitory room, and wordlessly, the dark-eyed girl at the desk takes my passport info and money. Upstairs in my room, in spite of the NO DRUG USE IN THE DORMS sign, the air is thick with hash smoke, and a bleary-eyed guy is smoking something through a tube on a piece of tinfoil, which I\u2019m pretty sure is neither hash nor legal. I lock my backpack in the locker and head back downstairs and out onto the street to a crowded Internet caf\u00e9.</p><p>I pay for a half hour and check out the budget airline sites. It\u2019s Thursday now. I fly home out of London on Monday. There\u2019s a flight to Lisbon for forty-six euros. One to Milan, and one to somewhere in Croatia! I Google Croatia and look at pictures of rocky beaches and old lighthouses. There are even cheap hotels in the lighthouses. I could stay in a lighthouse. I could do anything!</p><p>I know almost nothing about Croatia, so I decide to go there. I pull out my debit card to pay for the ticket, but I notice a new email has popped up in the other window I have open. I toggle over. It\u2019s from Wren. The subject line reads WHERE ARE YOU?</p><p>I quickly write back that I\u2019m in Amsterdam. When I said good-bye to Wren and the Oz gang in Paris last week, she was planning on catching a train to Madrid, and Kelly and the crew were heading to Nice, and they were talking about maybe meeting up in Barcelona, so I\u2019m a little surprised when, thirty seconds later, I get an email back from her that reads NO WAY. ME TOO!!!! The message has her cell number.</p> <p>I\u2019m grinning as I call her. \u201cI knew you were here,\u201d she says. \u201cI could feel it! Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt an Internet caf\u00e9 on the Warmoesstraat. Where are you? I thought you were going to Spain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI changed my plans. Winston, how far is Warmoesstraat?\u201d she calls. \u201cWinston\u2019s the cute guy who works here,\u201d she whispers to me. I hear a male voice in the background. Then Wren squeals. \u201cWe\u2019re, like, five minutes from each other. Meet me at Dam Square, in front of the white tower thing that looks like a penis.\u201d</p><p>I close the browser window, and ten minutes later, I\u2019m hugging Wren like she\u2019s a long-lost relative.</p><p>\u201cBoy, that Saint Anthony works fast,\u201d she says.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p><p>I give her the quick rundown about finding Ana Lucia, almost finding Willem, and deciding not to find him. \u201cSo now I\u2019m going to Croatia.\u201d</p><p>She looks disappointed. \u201cYou are. When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to fly out tomorrow morning. I was just booking my ticket when you called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, stay a few more days. We can explore together. We can rent bikes. Or rent one bike and have the other ride sidesaddle like the Dutch girls do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have a bike,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it have a rack on the back where I can sit?\u201d</p><p>Her grin is too infectious to resist. \u201cIt does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. You have to stay. I\u2019m at a hostel up near the Jordaan. My room is the size of a bathtub, but it\u2019s sweet and the bed\u2019s a double. Come share with me.\u201d</p><p>I look up. It is threatening rain again, and it\u2019s freezing for August, and the web said Croatia was mid-eighties and sunny. But Wren is here, and what are the chances of that? She believes in saints. I believe in accidents. I think we basically believe in the same thing.</p><p>We get my stuff out of my room at the hostel, where that one guy is now passed out, and move it to her hostel. It\u2019s much cozier than mine, especially since tall-dark-and- grinning Winston is there checking in on us. Upstairs, her bed is covered with guidebooks, not just from Europe but from all over the world.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinston loaned them to me. They\u2019re for my bucket list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBucket list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the things I want to do before I die.\u201d</p><p>That curious cryptic thing Wren said when we first met in Paris comes back to me: I know hospitals. I\u2019ve only known Wren a day and a half, but that\u2019s enough for the thought of losing her to be inconceivable. She must see something on my face, because she gently touches my arm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I plan on living a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you making a bucket list, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you wait until you\u2019re really dying, it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>I look at her. I know hospitals. The saints. \u201cWho?\u201d I ask softly.</p><p>\u201cMy sister, Francesca.\u201d She pulls out a piece of paper. It has a bunch of titles and locations, La Belle Ang\u00e8le (Paris), The Music Lesson (London), The Resurrection (Madrid). It goes on like that.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d I hand back the paper.</p><p>\u201cFrancesca didn\u2019t have much of a chance to be good at a lot of things, but she was a totally dedicated artist. She\u2019d be in the hospital, a chemo drip in one arm, a sketchpad in the other. She made hundreds of paintings and drawings, her legacy, she liked to say, because at least when she died, they\u2019d live on\u2014if only in the attic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know,\u201d I say, thinking of those paintings and sculptures in the art squat that might one day be in the Louvre.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s exactly it. She found a lot of comfort in the fact that artists like Van Gogh and Vermeer were obscure in life but famous in death. And she wanted to see their paintings in person, so the last time she was in remission, we made a pilgrimage to Toronto and New York to see a bunch of them. After that, she made a bigger list.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the list again. \u201cSo which painting is here? A Van Gogh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a Van Gogh on her list. The Starry Night, which we saw together in New York, and she has some Vermeers on here, though the one she loved best is in London. But that\u2019s her list, which has been back-burnered since Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Francesca, and I will see those paintings for her, one day. But I\u2019ve spent a lot of my life in her shadow. It had to be that way. But now she\u2019s gone\u2014and it\u2019s like I\u2019m still in her shadow, you know?\u201d</p><p>Strangely, I sort of do. I nod.</p><p>\u201cThere was something about seeing you in Paris. You\u2019re just this normal girl who\u2019s doing something kind of crazy. It inspired me. I changed my plans. And now I\u2019ve started to wonder if meeting you isn\u2019t the whole reason I\u2019m on this trip. That maybe Francesca, the saints, they wanted us to meet.\u201d</p><p>I get a chill from that. \u201cYou really think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I do. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell my parents you\u2019re the reason I\u2019m coming home a month later. They\u2019re a tad upset.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. I understand that too. \u201cSo what\u2019s on your list?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s far less noble than Francesca\u2019s.\u201d She reaches into her travel journal and pulls out a creased piece of paper. Kiss a boy on top of the Eiffel Tower. Roll in a field of tulips. Swim with dolphins. See the northern lights. Climb a volcano. Sing in a rock band. Cobble my own boots. Cook a feast for 25 friends. Make 25 friends. \u201cIt\u2019s a work in progress. I keep adding to it, and already I\u2019ve had some hiccups. I came here for tulip fields, but they only bloom in the springtime. So now I\u2019ll have to figure something else out. Oh, well. I think I can catch the northern lights in this place called Bod\u00f8 in Norway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you manage to kiss a boy on top of the Eiffel Tower?\u201d</p><p>Her lips prick up into a slightly wicked pixie elf grin. \u201cI did. I went up the morning you left. There was a group of Italians. They can be very obliging, those Italians.\u201d She lowers her voice to a whisper. \u201cI didn\u2019t even get a name.\u201d</p><p>I whisper back, \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-seven</p><p>We go to a late lunch at an Indonesian restaurant that serves one of those massive rijsttafel meals, and we stuff ourselves silly, and as we\u2019re wobbling along on the bike, I get an idea. It\u2019s not quite the flower fields at Keukenhof, but maybe it\u2019ll do. I get us lost for about twenty minutes until I find the flower market I passed this morning. The vendors are closing up their stalls and leaving behind a good number of throwaways. Wren and I steal a bunch of them and lay them out on the crooked sidewalk above the canal bank. She rolls around in them, happy as can be. I laugh as I snap some pictures with her camera and with my phone and text them to my mom. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The vendors look at her with mild amusement, as if this type of thing happens at least twice a week. Then a big bearded guy wearing suspenders over his butte of a belly comes over with some wilting lavender. \u201cShe can have these too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, Wren.\u201d I throw the fragrant purple blooms her way.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I say to the guy. Then I explain to him about Wren and her bucket list and the big fields of tulips being out of season so we had to settle for this.</p><p>He looks at Wren, who\u2019s attempting to extract the petals and leaves from her sweater. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a card. \u201cTulips in August is not so easy. But if you and your friend don\u2019t mind to wake up early, I can maybe get you a small field of them.\u201d</p> <p>The next morning, Wren and I set our alarm for four, and fifteen minutes later, go downstairs to the deserted street to find Wolfgang waiting with his mini truck. Every warning I\u2019ve ever had from my parents about not getting into cars with strangers comes to me, but I realize, as improbable as it is, Wolfgang isn\u2019t a stranger. We all three squeeze into the front seat as we trundle toward a greenhouse in Aalsmeer. Wren is practically bouncing with excitement, which seems unnatural for four fifteen in the morning, and she hasn\u2019t even had any coffee yet, though Wolfgang has thoughtfully brought a thermos of it along with some hard-boiled eggs and bread.</p><p>We spend the drive listening to cheesy europop and Wolfgang\u2019s tales of spending thirty years in the merchant marines before moving to the Jordaan neighborhood in Amsterdam. \u201cI\u2019m German by birth, but I\u2019ll be an Amsterdammer by death,\u201d he says with a big toothy grin.</p><p>By five o\u2019clock, we pull up to Bioflor, which hardly looks like the pictures of Keukenhof Gardens, with its carpets of color, but instead looks like some kind of industrial farm. I look at Wren and shrug. Wolfgang pulls in and stops alongside a football-field-sized greenhouse with a row of solar panels on top. A rosy-faced guy named Jos greets us. And then he unlocks the door, and Wren and I gasp.</p><p>There are rows and rows of flowers in every color. Acres of them. We walk down the tiny paths in between the beds, the air thick with humidity and manure until Wolfgang points out a section of tulips in fuchsia, sunburst, and one explosive citrusy combo that looks like a blood orange. I walk away, leaving Wren to her flowers.</p><p>She just stands there for a while. Then I hear her call out: \u201cThis is incredible. Can you see this?\u201d Wolfgang looks at me but I don\u2019t answer because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s us she\u2019s talking to.</p> <p>Wren runs around this greenhouse, and another one full of fragrant freesia, and I snap a bunch of pictures. And then Wolfgang has to get back. We belt Abba songs all the way, Wolfgang saying Abba is Esperanto for happiness, and the United Nations should play their songs at general assemblies.</p><p>It\u2019s only when we get to a warehouse outside Amsterdam that I notice that the back of Wolfgang\u2019s truck is still empty. \u201cDidn\u2019t you buy flowers for your stall?\u201d</p><p>He shakes his head. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t buy flowers directly from the farms. I buy at auction via wholesalers who deliver here.\u201d He points to where people are loading up their trucks with flowers.</p><p>\u201cSo you just went all the way out there for us?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He gives me a little shrug, like, of course, why else? And at this point, I really have no right to be surprised by people\u2019s capacity for kindness and generosity, but still, I am. I\u2019m floored every time.</p><p>\u201cCan we take you out to dinner tonight?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>He shakes his head. \u201cNot tonight. I\u2019m going to see a play in Vondelpark.\u201d He looks at us. \u201cYou should come. It\u2019s in English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would a play in Holland be in English?\u201d Wren asks.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the difference between the Germans and the Dutch,\u201d Wolfgang replies. \u201cThe Germans translate Shakespeare. The Dutch leave him in English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShakespeare?\u201d I ask, feeling every hair on my body rise. \u201cWhich play?\u201d</p><p>And before Wolfgang finishes telling me the title, I just start laughing. Because it\u2019s simply not possible. It\u2019s less possible than finding that one needle in a needle factory. Less possible than finding a lone star in the universe. It\u2019s less possible than finding that one person in all the billions who you might love.</p><p>Because tonight, playing in Vondelpark, is As You Like It. And I know with a certainty I cannot explain but that I would stake my life on, that he will be in it.</p><p>Thirty-eight</p><p>And so, after a year, I find him as I first found him: In a park, in the sultry dusk, speaking the words of William Shakespeare.</p> <p>Except tonight, after this year, everything is different. This is no Guerrilla Will. This is a real production, with a stage, with seats, with lights, with a crowd. A large crowd. Such that by the time we get there, we are shunted off to a low wall on the edge of the small amphitheater.</p><p>And this year, he is no longer in a supporting role. This year, he is a star. He is Orlando, as I knew he would be. He is the first actor to take the stage, and from that moment on, he owns it. He is riveting. Not just to me. To everyone. A hush falls over the crowd as soon as he delivers the first soliloquy and continues for the rest of the performance. The sky darkens, and the moths and mosquitoes dance in the spotlights, and Amsterdam\u2019s Vondelpark is transformed into the Forest of Arden, a magical place where that which was lost can be found.</p><p>As I watch him, it\u2019s as though it is only us two. Just Willem and me. Everything else disappears: The sound of bicycle bells and tram chimes disappears. The mosquitoes buzzing around the fountain in the pond disappear. The group of rowdy guys sitting next to us disappears. The other actors disappear. The last year disappears. All my doubts disappear. The feeling of being on the right path fills every part of me. I have found him. Here. As Orlando. Everything has led me to this.</p><p>His Orlando is different from the way we played it in class or from the way the actor in Boston played it. His is sexy and vulnerable, the yearning for Rosalind so palpable it becomes physical, a pheromone that wafts off him and drifts through the swirl of floodlights, where it lands on my damp and welcoming skin. I feel my lust, my yearning and, yes, my love, coming off me in pulses, swimming toward the stage, where I imagine them being fed to him, like lines.</p><p>He can\u2019t know I\u2019m here. But as crazy as it sounds, I feel like he does. I sense he feels me somewhere in the words he speaks, the same way I felt him when I first spoke them in Professor Glenny\u2019s class.</p><p>I remember so many of Rosalind\u2019s lines, of Orlando\u2019s too, that I can mouth them along with the actors. It feels like a private call-and-response chorus between me and Willem.</p><p>The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.</p><p>Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!</p><p>Then love me, Rosalind.</p><p>And wilt thou have me?</p><p>Are you not good?</p><p>I hope so.</p><p>Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her?</p><p>For ever and a day.</p><p>For ever and a day.</p><p>I hold Wren\u2019s hand in one of my hands and Wolfgang\u2019s with the other. We make a chain, us three. Standing there like that until the play is over. Until everyone gets their happy endings: Rosalind marries Orlando, and Celia marries Oliver, who reconciles with Orlando, and Phoebe marries Silvius, and the bad duke is redeemed, and the exiled duke is returned home.</p><p>After Rosalind gives her final soliloquy, it\u2019s over, and people are going crazy, just nuts, clapping and whistling, and I\u2019m turning and throwing my arms around Wren and then Wolfgang, pressing my cheek against the broadcloth of his cotton shirt, inhaling the smoky tobacco scent mingled with flower nectar and dirt. And then someone is hugging Wren and me, the rowdy guys from next to us. \u201cThat\u2019s my best friend!\u201d one of the guys shouts. He\u2019s got impish blue eyes, and he\u2019s a head shorter than the others, more Hobbit than Dutchman.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Wren asks. She\u2019s now being passed around in hugs by the rowdy, and it appears, drunk, Dutch guys.</p><p>\u201cOrlando!\u201d the Hobbit answers.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Wren says, her eyes so wide and pale they gleam like pearls. \u201cOh,\u201d she says to me.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be Robert-Jan, by any chance?\u201d I ask.</p><p>The Hobbit looks surprised for a second. Then he just grins. \u201cBroodje to my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroodje,\u201d Wolfgang chuckles. He turns to me. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of sandwich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich Broodje loves to eat,\u201d one of his friends says, patting his belly.</p><p>Broodje/Robert-Jan pushes the hand away. \u201cYou should come to our party tonight. It\u2019s going to be the party to end all parties. He was fantastic, was he not?\u201d</p><p>Wren and I both nod. Broodje/Robert-Jan goes on about how great Willem was and then his friend says something to him in Dutch, something, I think, about Willem.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d I whisper to Wolfgang.</p><p>\u201cHe said he hasn\u2019t seen him, Orlando, I think, so happy, since, I didn\u2019t hear it all, something about his father.\u201d</p><p>Wolfgang takes out a packet of tobacco from a leather pouch and begins to roll a cigarette. Without looking at me, he says in his rumbly voice, \u201cI think the actors come out over there.\u201d He points to the little metal gate on the far side of the stage.</p><p>He lights his cigarette. His eyes flash. He points to the gate again.</p><p>My body feels like it\u2019s no longer solid matter. It is particle dust. It is pure electricity. It dances me across the theater, toward the side of the stage. There is a crowd of well-wishers awaiting the actors. People holding bouquets of flowers, bottles of champagne. The actress who played Celia comes out to whoops and hugs. Next comes Adam, then Rosalind, who gets a heap of bouquets. My heart starts to thunder. Could I have come this close only to miss him?</p><p>But then I hear him. He is, as always, laughing; this time at something the guy who played Jacques said. And then I see his hair, shorter than it was, his eyes, dark and light all at once, his face, a small scar on his cheek, which only makes him more strikingly handsome.</p><p>My breath catches in my throat. I\u2019d thought I\u2019d embellished him. But really, if anything, the opposite is true. I\u2019d forgotten how truly beautiful he is. How intrinsically Willem.</p><p>Willem. His name forms in my throat.</p><p>\u201cWillem!\u201d His name rings out loud and clear.</p><p>But it\u2019s not my voice that said it.</p><p>I touch my fingers to my throat to be sure.</p><p>\u201cWillem!\u201d</p><p>I hear the voice again. And then I see the blur of movement. A young woman races out from the crowd. The flowers she is carrying drop to the ground as she hurls herself into his arms. And he takes her in. He lifts her off the ground, holds her tight. His arms clutch into her auburn hair, laughing at whatever it is she\u2019s whispering into his ear. They spin around, a tangle of happiness. Of love.</p><p>I stand there rooted, watching this very private public display. Finally, someone comes up to Willem and taps him on the shoulder, and the woman slides to the ground. She picks up the flowers\u2014sunflowers, exactly what I would\u2019ve chosen for him\u2014and dusts them off. Willem slides an easy arm around her and kisses her hand. She snakes her arm around his waist. And I realize then that I wasn\u2019t wrong about the love wafting off him during the performance. I was just wrong about who it was for.</p><p>They walk off, so close I can feel the breeze as he passes by. We are so close, but he\u2019s looking at her, so he doesn\u2019t see me at all. They go off, hand in hand, toward a gazebo, away from the fray. I just stand there.</p><p>I feel a gentle tap on my shoulder. It\u2019s Wolfgang. He looks at me, tilts his head to the side. \u201cFinished?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I look back at Willem and the girl. Maybe this is the French girl. Or someone altogether new. They are sitting facing each other, knees touching, talking, holding hands. It\u2019s like the rest of the world doesn\u2019t exist. That\u2019s how it felt when I was with him last year. Maybe if an outsider saw us then, that\u2019s exactly how we would\u2019ve looked. But now I\u2019m the one who\u2019s the outsider. I look at them again. Even from here, I can tell she is someone special to him. Someone he loves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wait for the fist of devastation, the collapse of a year\u2019s worth of hopes, the roar of sadness. And I do feel it. The pain of losing him. Or the idea of him. But along with that pain is something else, something quiet at first, so I have to strain for it. But when I do, I hear the sound of a door quietly clicking shut. And then the most amazing thing happens: The night is calm, but I feel a rush of wind, as if a thousand other doors have just simultaneously flung open.</p><p>I give one last glance toward Willem. Then I turn to Wolfgang. \u201cFinished,\u201d I say.</p><p>But I suspect the opposite is true. That really, I\u2019m just beginning.</p><p>Thirty-nine</p> <p>I wake up to bright blinking sunlight. I squint at the travel alarm. It\u2019s almost noon. In four hours, I\u2019m leaving. Wren has decided to stay on a few more days. There\u2019s a bunch of weird museums she just found out about that she wants to see, one devoted to medieval torture, another to handbags, and Winston has told her that he knows someone who can teach her how to cobble shoes, which might keep her here another week. But I have three days left, and I\u2019ve decided to go to Croatia.</p><p>I won\u2019t get there till tonight, and I\u2019ll have to leave first thing Monday morning to make my flight back home. So I\u2019ll have just one full day there. But I now know what can happen it just one day. Absolutely anything.</p><p>Wren thinks I\u2019m making a mistake. She didn\u2019t see Willem with the redhead, and she keeps arguing that she could be anyone\u2014his sister, for instance. I don\u2019t tell her that Willem, like me, like Wren herself now, is an only child. All last night, she begged me to go to the party, to see how it played out. \u201cI know where it is. Robert-Jan told me. It\u2019s on, oh, I can\u2019t remember the street name, but he said it means \u2018belt\u2019 in Dutch. Number one eighty-nine.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d held up my hand. \u201cStop! I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut just imagine,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cWhat if you\u2019d never met Willem before, and Broodje invited us to the party, and we went, and you two met there for the first time and fell in love? Maybe that\u2019s what happens.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a nice theory. And I can\u2019t help but wonder if that would\u2019ve happened. Would we fall in love if we met today? Had I really fallen in love with him in the first place? Or was it just infatuation fueled by mystery?</p><p>But I\u2019m also starting to wonder something else. If maybe the point of this crazy quest I\u2019m on wasn\u2019t to help me find Willem. Maybe it was to help me find someone else entirely.</p><p>I\u2019m getting dressed when Wren opens the door, clutching a paper bag. \u201cHi, sleepyhead. I made you some breakfast. Or rather Winston did. He said it\u2019s very Dutch.\u201d</p><p>I take the bag. \u201cThanks.\u201d I look Wren, who\u2019s grinning like crazy. \u201cWinston, huh?\u201d</p><p>Now she\u2019s blushing. \u201cHe just got off work and he\u2019s going to take me for a bike ride and introduce me to his cobbler friend as soon as you leave,\u201d she says, her grin now threatening to split her face. \u201cAnd tomorrow he says I have to go to an Ajax football game with him.\u201d She pauses to consider. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t on my list, but you never know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Well, I should go soon. Let you get to your, um, cobbling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut your flight\u2019s not for ages yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I want to leave enough time, and I hear the airport is amazing.\u201d</p><p>I pack up the rest of my things and go downstairs with Wren. Winston points me toward the train station.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want me to come with you to the station or the airport?\u201d Wren asks.</p><p>I shake my head. I want to see Wren ride away on the pink bike as if I\u2019ll see her again tomorrow. She hugs me tight and then kisses me three times like the Dutch do. \u201cTot ziens,\u201d she calls. \u201cIt means \u2018see you later\u2019 in Dutch, because we aren\u2019t saying good-bye.\u201d I swallow the lump in my throat. And then Winston gets on his big black bike and Wren gets on the little pink bike, and they pedal away.</p><p>I hoist my backpack up and make the short walk to the train station. There are trains every fifteen minutes or so to Schiphol, and I buy a ticket and a cup of tea and go sit under the clattering destination board to eat my breakfast. When I see what\u2019s inside, I have to laugh. Because Winston has made me a hagelslag sandwich. For all our talk, I never did get to try this particular delicacy.</p><p>I take a bite. The hagelslag crunches, then melts into the butter and still-warm bread. And what\u2019s left over tastes just like him.</p><p>All at once, I finally understand what it means for time to be fluid. Because suddenly the entire last year flows before me, condensing and expanding, so that I\u2019m here in Amsterdam eating hagelslag, and at the same time, I\u2019m in Paris, his hand on my hip, and at the same time, I\u2019m on that first train to London, watching the countryside whiz by, and at the same time, I\u2019m in the line for Hamlet. I see Willem. At the canal basin, catching my eye. On the train, his jeans still unstained, me still unstained. On the train to Paris, his thousand shades of laughter.</p> <p>The destination board shuffles, and I look up at it, and as I do, imagine a different version of time. One in which Willem quits while he\u2019s ahead. One in which he never makes that remark about my breakfast. One in which he just says good-bye on that platform in London instead of inviting me to Paris. Or one in which he never stops to talk to me in Stratford-upon-Avon.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I understand that I have been stained. Whether I\u2019m still in love with him, whether he was ever in love with me, and no matter who he\u2019s in love with now, Willem changed my life. He showed me how to get lost, and then I showed myself how to get found.</p><p>Maybe accident isn\u2019t the right word after all. Maybe miracle is.</p><p>Or maybe it\u2019s not a miracle. Maybe this is just life. When you open yourself up to it. When you put yourself in the path of it. When you say yes.</p><p>How can I come this far and not tell him\u2014he, who would understand it best\u2014that by giving me the that flyer, by inviting me to skip Hamlet, he helped me realize that it\u2019s not to be that matters, but how to be?</p><p>How can I come this far and not be brave?</p><p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d I say to a woman in a polka-dot dress and cowboy boots. \u201cIs there a street in Amsterdam named after a belt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCeintuurbaan,\u201d she answers. \u201cTram line twenty-five. Right outside the station.\u201d</p><p>I race out of the train station and jump onto the tram, asking the driver where to get off for Ceintuurbaan number one eighty-nine. \u201cNear Sarphatipark,\u201d he replies. \u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>Twenty minutes later, I get off at the park. Inside, there\u2019s a small playground with a large sandpit, and I go sit down under a tree to summon my bravery. A couple of children are putting the finishing touches on an elaborate sand castle, several feet high, with towers and turrets and moats.</p><p>I stand up and make my way to the building. I don\u2019t even know for sure that he lives here, except that the feeling of rightness, it has never been stronger. There are three bells. I ring the bottom one. An intercom squawks with a woman\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I call. Before I say anything else, the door clicks open.</p><p>I walk inside the dark, musty hallway. A door swings open, and my heart skips a beat, but it\u2019s not him. It\u2019s an older woman with a yappy dog at her heels.</p><p>\u201cWillem?\u201d I ask her. She points a thumb up and shuts her door.</p><p>I climb the steep stairs to the second floor. There are two other flats in the building, so this could be his, or the one upstairs. So I just stand there on the doorstep for a moment, listening for sounds inside. It is quiet, save for the faint strains of music. But my heart is beating fast and strong, like a radar pinging: Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>My hand shakes a little bit as I knock, and at first the sound is faint, as if I\u2019m knocking on a hollowed-out log. But then I tighten my grip, and I knock again. I hear his footsteps. I remember the scar on his foot. Was it on the right foot or the left? The footsteps come closer. I feel my heart speed up, in double time to those footsteps.</p><p>And then the door swings open, and he\u2019s there.</p><p>Willem.</p><p>His tall body casts a shadow over me, just like it did that first day, that only other day, really, when we met. His eyes, those dark, dark eyes, hiding a spectrum of hidden things, they widen, and his mouth drops. I hear his gasp of breath, the shock of it all.</p><p>He just stands there, his body taking up the doorway, looking at me like I am a ghost, which I suppose I am. But if he knows anything at all about Shakespeare, it\u2019s that the ghosts always come haunting.</p><p>I look at him as the questions and answers collide all over his face. There is so much I want to tell him. Where do I even begin?</p><p>\u201cHi, Willem,\u201d I say. \u201cMy name is Allyson.\u201d</p><p>He says nothing in response. He just stays there for a minute, looking at me. And then he steps to the side, opens the door wider, wide enough for me to walk through.</p><p>And so I do. </p> </body></html>"]
