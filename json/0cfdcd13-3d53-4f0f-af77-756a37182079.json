Everything depended upon this letter: his honor, his estates, his family\u2019s future\u2014and his life.</p> <p>But as he wrote, he began to hear a woman weeping. Annoyed, he got up from the crude little table and looked out the tiny open window to the courtyard below. There were four men walking about, but there was no woman. Besides, Nicholas was three stories up, so he could not have heard her. The room he was in had walls so thick he could hear nothing from outside, and the oak door was heavy and bound with iron.</p><p>\u201cShe is not of this world,\u201d he told himself, then gave a shiver as he crossed himself. He sat back down at the table and again began to write.</p><p>But the moment he sat down, he heard her again. Her weeping had been soft at first, but it was growing louder.</p><p>For a moment, Nicholas cocked his head to one side and listened. Yes, she was weeping, but her tears were not from fear, or even from grief. No, he could feel that the source of her pain came from something deeper.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said aloud. He did not have the time to try to understand this woman, whether she was of flesh or spirit. Right now, his need was as great as hers. He gave his attention back to the letter, but he could not concentrate. The woman\u2019s tears were pulling him to her. She needed something, but he could not tell what. Did she need comfort? Soothing? What did she want of him?</p> <p>Putting down his quill, he ran his hand over his eyes. The woman\u2019s tears were filling his head. No, he thought, what she needed was hope. The weeping was from a person who no longer had hope.</p><p>Determined to turn his mind back to his own problems, Nicholas looked back at the letter. The woman\u2019s problems were not his. If he did not finish this letter and give it to the waiting messenger soon, his own life would be without hope.</p><p>Nicholas wrote two more lines, but then he had to stop. The crying was increasing, growing louder. As it increased in volume, it seemed to grow inside until it filled every corner of the room\u2014and every nook inside his brain.</p><p>\u201cLady,\u201d he whispered, his voice filled with desperation, \u201cgive me peace. I would give my life to help you, but I cannot. My life is pledged elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Again, he picked up the pen and tried to write, this time with his other hand over his ear, doing his best to block out the sounds from the woman.</p><p>But Nicholas couldn\u2019t stop hearing her. He dropped the quill, ink running across the document as he put both hands over his ears and closed his eyes tight. \u201cWhat would you have of me?\u201d he cried. \u201cI would give you all that I can, but I have nothing left to give.\u201d</p> <p>But his pleas meant nothing, for the woman\u2019s weeping grew and grew until the inside of Nicholas\u2019s head began to go round and round. Slowly, he opened his eyes, but he saw nothing. Before him was only darkness. He could not see the walls of the room or the door. He could feel the chair beneath him, but he could no longer see the table or the letter that was so important to him.</p><p>But as he sat there, a small, bright light appeared in the far distance, and Nicholas felt himself drawn to the light. As he looked at that tiny speck so far away, it was as though nothing in his life had ever mattered but that light.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered. Then he closed his eyes and gave himself over to the sound of the woman\u2019s tears. Slowly, his body relaxed and he put his head down beside the letter he had been writing. \u201cYes,\u201d he whispered again as he surrendered himself.</p><p>ONE</p><p>ENGLAND</p><p>1988</p><p>Dougless Montgomery sat in the backseat of the rental car, Robert and his pudgy thirteen-year-old daughter, Gloria, in the front. As usual, Gloria was eating. Dougless shifted her slim legs to try to make herself more comfortable around Gloria\u2019s luggage. There were six large pieces of matched leather luggage to hold Gloria\u2019s belongings, and since they wouldn\u2019t fit in the trunk of the little car, they were piled in the back with Dougless. There was a makeup case under her feet and a big wardrobe on the seat beside her. Every time she moved, she scraped against a buckle, a welt, or a handle. Right now, she had an itch under her left knee, but she couldn\u2019t reach it.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d Gloria whined, sounding like an invalid four-year-old, \u201cshe\u2019s scratching the pretty suitcases you bought me.\u201d</p> <p>Dougless clenched her fists, closed her eyes, and counted to ten. She. Gloria never said Dougless\u2019s name, but just called her She.</p><p>Robert glanced over his shoulder at Dougless. \u201cDougless, could you please be a bit more careful? That luggage is quite expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am aware of that,\u201d Dougless said, trying to keep the anger out of her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m having a difficult time sitting back here. There isn\u2019t much room.\u201d</p><p>Robert gave a great sigh of weariness. \u201cDougless, do you have to complain about everything? Can\u2019t you even allow a vacation to be pleasant? All I asked was that you make an effort.\u201d</p><p>Dougless opened her mouth to reply but closed it. She didn\u2019t want to start another argument. Besides, she knew that it would do no good. So, instead of replying, she swallowed her anger\u2014then rubbed her stomach. It was hurting again. She wanted to ask Robert to stop to get something to drink so she could take one of the tranquilizers the doctor had prescribed for her nervous stomach. \u201cKeep this up and you\u2019ll give yourself an ulcer,\u201d the doctor had warned her. But Dougless wouldn\u2019t give Gloria the satisfaction of knowing that she\u2019d yet again managed to upset Dougless and to, yet again, drive a wedge between Dougless and Robert.</p><p>But when Dougless glanced up, she saw Gloria smirking at her in the makeup mirror on the sun visor. With determination, Dougless looked away and tried to concentrate on the beauty of the English countryside.</p><p>Outside the car window she saw green fields, old stone fences, cows and more cows, picturesque little houses, magnificent mansions, and . . . and Gloria, she thought. Dougless seemed to see Gloria everywhere. Robert kept saying, \u201cShe\u2019s just a child and her daddy has left her. It\u2019s only natural that she\u2019s going to have some hostility toward you. But please try to show some sympathy for her, will you? She\u2019s really a sweet kid when you get to know her.\u201d</p><p>A sweet kid, Dougless thought as she looked out the window. At thirteen, Gloria wore more makeup than Dougless did at twenty-six\u2014and Gloria spent hours in the hotel bathroom applying it. Gloria sat in the front of the car. \u201cShe\u2019s just a kid and it\u2019s her first trip to England,\u201d Robert said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve been to England before, so why not be generous?\u201d That Dougless was supposed to read the road map when she could hardly see around Gloria\u2019s head didn\u2019t seem to count for much.</p><p>Dougless tried to concentrate on the scenery. Robert said Dougless was jealous of his daughter. He said that she didn\u2019t want to share him with anyone else, but that if she\u2019d just relax, they\u2019d be a very happy threesome. \u201cWe could be a second family for a little girl who has lost so much,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dougless had tried to like Gloria. She\u2019d tried hard to be an adult and ignore, and even understand, Gloria\u2019s hostility, but it was more than Dougless could do. In the year she and Robert had been living together, Dougless had made every possible effort to find that \u201csweet kid\u201d that Robert had told her of. Several times, she\u2019d taken Gloria shopping and spent more money on Gloria than Dougless\u2019s small elementary school teacher\u2019s salary allowed her to spend on herself. Several Saturday nights Dougless had stayed at the house she shared with Robert, babysitting Gloria while he went to professional functions, usually cocktail parties or dinners. When Dougless had said she\u2019d like to attend with him, Robert had said, \u201cBut time alone is what you two need. You need to get to know each other. And, remember, babe, I\u2019m a package deal. Love me, love my kid.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes Dougless had started to believe that it was beginning to work because she and Gloria were cordial, even friendly, to each other when they were alone. But the minute Robert appeared, Gloria changed into a whining, lying brat. She sat on Robert\u2019s lap, all five foot two inches, one hundred and forty pounds of her, and wailed that She had been \u201cawfully mean\u201d to her.</p><p>At first Dougless had laughed at what Gloria was saying. How absurd to think she would ever harm a child! Anyone could see that the girl was just trying to get her father\u2019s attention.</p><p>But to Dougless\u2019s utter disbelief, Robert believed every word his daughter said. He didn\u2019t accuse Dougless. No, instead, he just asked her to be a \u201clittle kinder\u201d to \u201cthe poor kid.\u201d Immediately, Dougless\u2019s defenses had gone up. \u201cIs that supposed to mean you don\u2019t think I\u2019m a kind person? You do think I would mistreat a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just asking you to be the adult and have a little patience and understanding, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>When Dougless asked what he meant by that, Robert had thrown up his hands and said that he couldn\u2019t talk to her; then he\u2019d walked out of the room. Dougless had taken two of her stomach tranquilizers.</p><p>After the arguments, Dougless had wavered between guilt and rage. She had a classroom of children who adored her, yet Gloria seemed to hate her. Was Dougless jealous? Was she somehow unconsciously letting this child know she didn\u2019t want to share Robert with his own daughter? Every time Dougless thought of her possible jealousy she vowed to try harder to make Gloria like her, which usually meant she bought Gloria another expensive gift. And she\u2019d again agree to babysit on the weekends when Gloria stayed with them. While Gloria\u2019s mother had a life, Dougless thought with bitterness.</p><p>At other times, all Dougless felt was rage. Couldn\u2019t Robert just once\u2014one time\u2014take Dougless\u2019s side? Couldn\u2019t he tell Gloria that Dougless\u2019s comfort was more important than the blasted suitcases? Or maybe he could tell Gloria that Dougless had a name and wasn\u2019t always to be referred to as she or her? But every time Dougless said something like that to Robert, she ended up apologizing. Robert said, \u201cMy God, Dougless, you\u2019re the adult. And I only see her on alternate weekends, so of course I\u2019m going to favor her over you. You and I are together every day, so why can\u2019t you stand to play second fiddle now and then?\u201d</p><p>His words sounded right, but at the same time, Dougless fantasized about Robert telling his daughter to \u201cbe more respectful\u201d toward the \u201cwoman I love.\u201d</p><p>But that didn\u2019t happen, so Dougless kept her mouth shut and enjoyed the time she and Robert had when Gloria wasn\u2019t around. When Gloria wasn\u2019t with them, she and Robert were perfectly suited, and she knew, through age old intuition, that very soon she was going to receive what she wanted so much: a marriage proposal.</p><p>Truthfully, marriage was what Dougless wanted most in life. She\u2019d never been burning with ambition the way her older sisters were. Dougless just wanted a nice home and a husband, and a few children. Maybe someday, after the kids were in school, she\u2019d write children\u2019s books, something about talking animals, but she had no desire to fight her way up a corporate ladder.</p><p>Already, she\u2019d invested eighteen months of her life in Robert, and he was perfect husband material. He was tall, handsome, well-dressed, and an excellent orthopedic surgeon. He always hung up his clothes, and he helped with the housework; he didn\u2019t chase after women, and he always came home when he said he would. He was reliable, dependable, faithful\u2014but, most important, he needed her so very much.</p><p>Not long after they met, Robert had told Dougless his life story. As a child, he hadn\u2019t been loved very much, and he told Dougless that her sweet, generous heart was what he\u2019d been looking for all his life. His first wife, whom he\u2019d divorced over four years ago, was a cold fish, a woman who Robert said was incapable of love. Just three months after he met Dougless, he told her he wanted a \u201cpermanent relationship\u201d with her\u2014which she took to mean marriage\u2014but first he wanted to know how they \u201crelated\u201d to each other. After all, he\u2019d been hurt so badly the first time. In other words, he wanted them to live together.</p><p>What he said made sense to her, and since Dougless had had a number of \u201cunfortunate\u201d previous relationships with men, she happily moved into Robert\u2019s big, beautiful, expensive house, then set about doing everything she could to prove to Robert that she was as warm and generous and loving as his mother and wife had been cold.</p><p>With the exception of dealing with Gloria, living with Robert had been great. He was an energetic man and they often went dancing, hiking, bicycle riding. They entertained a great deal and often went to parties. She\u2019d never lived with a man before, but she had easily settled into a domestic routine, feeling as though it was what she was made for.</p><p>They had problems other than Gloria, of course, but Robert was so much better than any of the other men Dougless had dated that she forgave him his little quirks\u2014most of which revolved around money. True, it was annoying that when they went to the grocery together he nearly always \u201cforgot\u201d his checkbook. And at the ticket window of theaters and when the check was presented in restaurants, half the time Robert found he\u2019d left his wallet at home. If Dougless complained, he\u2019d talk to her about the new age of liberated women and how most women were fighting to pay half the expenses. Then he\u2019d kiss her sweetly and take her somewhere expensive for dinner\u2014and he\u2019d pay. And Dougless forgave him.</p><p>Dougless knew she could stand the small problems\u2014everyone had idiosyncracies\u2014but it was Gloria that sent her screaming. When Gloria was with them, their life turned into a battleground. According to Robert, his daughter was perfection on earth, and because Dougless didn\u2019t see her that way, Robert began to see Dougless as the enemy. When the three of them were together, it was Robert and Gloria on one team and Dougless on the other.</p><p>Now, on this holiday in England, in the front seat Gloria offered her father a piece of candy from the box on her lap. Neither of them seemed to think of offering any to Dougless.</p><p>Still looking out the window, Dougless gritted her teeth. Perhaps it was the combination of Gloria and money that was making her so angry, because, with this trip, Robert\u2019s little \u201cmoney quirk\u201d as Dougless had always thought of it, had turned into something more.</p><p>When Dougless had first met Robert, they had talked for hours about their dreams and they\u2019d talked many times of taking a trip to England. As a child, she had often traveled to England with her family, but she hadn\u2019t been back in years. When she and Robert had moved in together, in September of last year, Robert had said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to England one year from today. By then we\u2019ll know.\u201d He hadn\u2019t elaborated on what they would \u201cknow,\u201d but Dougless was sure that he meant that, in a year, they\u2019d know whether or not they were compatible for marriage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a whole year, Dougless had worked on planning the trip, which she\u2019d come to think of as their honeymoon. A \u201cpre-honeymoon,\u201d she called it in her mind. \u201cThe decision maker,\u201d she said to herself, then smiled. She made reservations at the most romantic, most exclusive country house hotels England had to offer. When she had asked Robert\u2019s opinion of a hotel, he\u2019d winked at her and said, \u201cSpare no expense for this trip.\u201d She had ordered brochures, bought travel books, read and researched until she knew the names of half the villages in England. Robert\u2019s only stipulation had been that he wanted an educational trip as well as fun, so she\u2019d compiled a list of many things to do that were close to their lovely hotels\u2014which was easy to do, since Great Britain is like a Disneyland for history lovers.</p><p>Then, three months before they were to leave, Robert said that he had a surprise for her on this trip, a very, very special surprise that was going to fill her with joy. His words had made Dougless work even harder on the plans, and she found their little game of secrecy exciting. As Dougless planned, she thought, Will he propose here? Or maybe here. This place would be nice.</p><p>Three weeks before they left, she was balancing Robert\u2019s household-accounts checkbook when she saw a canceled check for five thousand dollars made out to a jewelry store.</p><p>As she held the check, tears of happiness came to her eyes. \u201cAn engagement ring,\u201d she\u2019d whispered. That Robert had spent so much was proof that even though he was a tad stingy on small things, when something really counted, he was generous.</p> <p>For the next few weeks Dougless had walked on clouds. She cooked wonderful meals for Robert and had been especially energetic in the bedroom, doing everything she could think of to please him.</p><p>Two days before they were to leave, Robert punctured her bubble a bit\u2014not enough to burst it, but it had certainly been deflated. He had asked to see the bills for the trip, plane tickets, advance reservations, whatever she had. He had then added the amounts and handed her the calculator tape.</p><p>\u201cThis is your half of the cost,\u201d he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cMine?\u201d she\u2019d asked stupidly, not understanding what he was saying.</p><p>\u201cI know how important it is to you women today to pay your own way, so I don\u2019t want to be accused of being a male chauvinist pig,\u201d he\u2019d said with a smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be a burden to a man, do you? You don\u2019t want to add to all my responsibilities at the hospital and to my ex-wife, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, of course not,\u201d Dougless had mumbled, feeling confused, as she often did when confronted with Robert\u2019s reasoning. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t have any money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDougless, baby, please tell me that you don\u2019t spend everything you make. Maybe you should take a course in accounting.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cBut then your family has money, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>That was one of the times Dougless\u2019s stomach had begun to hurt, and she remembered the doctor\u2019s warning about giving herself an ulcer. She had explained to Robert about her family a hundred times. Yes, her family had money\u2014lots of it\u2014but her father believed his daughters should know how to support themselves, so Dougless was on her own until she was thirty-five; then she\u2019d inherit. She knew that if there was an emergency, her father would help her, but a pleasure trip to England hardly counted as an emergency.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Dougless,\u201d Robert had said with a smile when Dougless didn\u2019t reply to his question. \u201cI keep hearing what a paragon of love and support that family of yours is, so why can\u2019t they help you now?\u201d Before she could speak, Robert raised her hand to his lips and kissed it. \u201cAh, baby, please try to get the money. I so much want us to go on this trip because I have such a very, very special surprise for you.\u201d</p><p>Part of Dougless had wanted to shout that he wasn\u2019t being fair. He should have made it clear that she was going to be required to pay for half of the trip before she\u2019d made reservations at such expensive hotels. But another part of her asked why she\u2019d expected him to pay for her share. They weren\u2019t married. They were, as Robert often called them, \u201cpartners.\u201d \u201cSounds like John Wayne and a sidekick,\u201d Dougless had muttered the first time he\u2019d said that, but Robert had just laughed.</p><p>In the end Dougless couldn\u2019t bear to ask her father for money. It would be like admitting defeat to him. Instead, she\u2019d called a cousin in Colorado and asked him for a loan. The money had been given to her freely, no interest, but she\u2019d had to endure her cousin\u2019s lecture. \u201cHe\u2019s a surgeon, you\u2019re an underpaid teacher, you\u2019ve been living together for a year, but he expects you to pay for half of an expensive trip?\u201d her cousin had said. Dougless had wanted to explain about Robert\u2019s mother, who had used money to punish her son, and about his cold ex-wife, who had spent everything Robert earned. Dougless had wanted to explain that money was just a small part of their lives and that she was pretty sure that Robert was going to propose marriage on this trip.</p> <p>But Dougless said none of that. \u201cJust send the money, will you?\u201d she\u2019d snapped.</p><p>But her cousin\u2019s words had upset her, so, during the few days remaining before they left, Dougless gave herself several little lectures. It was only fair that she pay her own way, wasn\u2019t it? And Robert was right: it was the day of the liberated woman. Her father, by not dropping millions in her lap before she could handle them, was teaching her to take care of herself and, now, so was Robert. And, most of all, she told herself that she had been an idiot for not realizing beforehand that she was supposed to pay her own way.</p><p>After Dougless had contributed her half to the bills, for the most part, she recovered her good humor, and by the time she\u2019d packed their suitcases, she was again looking forward to the trip. Happily, she filled her tote bag with necessary toiletries, travel books, and as many gadgets as she could cram into it.</p><p>In the taxi on the way to the airport, Robert had been especially nice to her. He\u2019d nuzzled her neck until she\u2019d pushed him away in embarrassment when she saw the taxi driver watching.</p><p>\u201cHave you guessed the surprise yet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou won the lottery,\u201d Dougless answered, still playing the game and pretending ignorance.</p><p>\u201cBetter than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see . . . You\u2019ve bought a castle and we\u2019ll live in it forever as lord and lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMuch better than that,\u201d Robert said seriously. \u201cDo you have any idea what the upkeep on one of those places is? I\u2019ll bet you can\u2019t guess anything as good as this surprise.\u201d</p><p>Dougless had looked at him with love. She knew just what her wedding dress would look like, and she imagined all her relatives smiling at her in approval. Would their children have Robert\u2019s blue eyes or her green? His brown hair or her auburn? \u201cI have no idea what the surprise is,\u201d she said, lying.</p><p>Leaning back against the seat, Robert smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll soon find out,\u201d he\u2019d said enigmatically.</p><p>At the airport Dougless dealt with checking the luggage while Robert kept looking about the terminal as though he were searching for something. As Dougless tipped the porter, Robert threw up his hand to wave to someone. At first Dougless was too busy to realize what was happening.</p><p>She looked up at the cry, \u201cDaddy!\u201d and saw Gloria running across the terminal, a porter trailing behind her pushing a hand truck loaded with six new suitcases.</p><p>What a coincidence, Dougless thought as she checked the tags the baggage handler gave her. Imagine meeting Gloria at the airport. Distractedly, Dougless watched as Gloria flung herself on her father. Moments later they broke apart, Robert keeping his arm tightly around his precious daughter\u2019s plump shoulders.</p><p>Once Dougless had finished with the bags, she gave her attention to Robert\u2019s daughter, and it was difficult to keep the frown off her face. Gloria was wearing a fringed jacket and cowboy boots, and a too-short leather skirt. She looked like an overweight stripper from the sixties.</p><p>Where was her mother and how could she allow the child to dress like that? Dougless thought as she glanced about the airport for Robert\u2019s ex-wife.</p><p>\u201cHello, Gloria,\u201d Dougless said. \u201cAre you and your mother going somewhere too?\u201d</p><p>Gloria and her father nearly collapsed with laughter at Dougless\u2019s words. \u201cYou haven\u2019t told her,\u201d Gloria squealed.</p><p>It took Robert a moment to sober himself. \u201cThis is the surprise,\u201d he said, pushing Gloria forward as though she were some huge trophy Dougless had just won. \u201cIsn\u2019t this the most wonderful surprise you could imagine?\u201d</p><p>Dougless still didn\u2019t understand\u2014or maybe she was too horrified to want to understand. All she could do was stand there and stare at the two of them, speechless.</p><p>Robert put his other arm around Dougless and drew her close to him. \u201cBoth of my girls are going with me,\u201d he said with pride.</p><p>\u201cBoth?\u201d Dougless whispered, her throat closing down on her.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Robert said, his voice joyous. \u201cGloria is the surprise I\u2019ve been hinting at for weeks. She\u2019s going with us to England. I knew you\u2019d never guess! You didn\u2019t, did you?\u201d</p><p>No, Dougless had not come close to guessing. And now that she was finally understanding that the beautiful, romantic trip she\u2019d dreamed of wasn\u2019t going to happen, she wanted to scream, to yell, and to refuse to go. But she did none of those things. \u201cAll the hotel rooms are just for two people,\u201d she\u2019d managed to say at last.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll have a rollaway bed brought in,\u201d Robert said in dismissal. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll manage, because we have love going for us and that\u2019s all we need.\u201d He dropped his arm from Dougless\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNow for business. Dougless, you won\u2019t mind getting Gloria\u2019s luggage checked in while I catch up with lambykins, will you?\u201d</p><p>Dougless could only shake her head. Numbly she went off to the ticket counter, the porter and the suitcases following her. She had to pay two hundred and eighty dollars in overcharge for Gloria\u2019s four extra bags, and she had to tip the porter.</p><p>They didn\u2019t have much time to spare before the plane took off, and Robert and his daughter were absorbed in each other so, thankfully, Dougless wasn\u2019t asked to speak. If she had been asked anything, she wasn\u2019t sure she could have answered. With each passing minute, she saw one dream after another disappear. Champagne dinners gave way to fast food eaten in the car. Afternoons spent lazily strolling on wooded paths turned into visions of arguments about \u201cfinding something Gloria can enjoy, too\u201d\u2014a request that Dougless had already heard too many times.</p><p>And then there was the privacy issue. The three of them would share one room. When could she and Robert be alone?</p><p>It was when they boarded the plane that Dougless saw that Robert had put quite a bit of work into Gloria\u2019s trip. Her boarding pass said she was in the same row as they were, in the aisle seat.</p><p>But Robert set Gloria between them, so Dougless ended up on the aisle, which she hated because no matter where she put her arms or her legs, she was always told by the flight attendant that she was blocking the passage of the cart.</p><p>It was during the long flight that Robert, smiling, had handed Dougless Gloria\u2019s ticket. \u201cAdd this to our list of expenses, will you? And I\u2019ll need a penny by penny\u2014or should I say shilling by shilling,\u201d he added, winking at Gloria, \u201caccounting of all the money spent. My accountant thinks I can deduct this whole trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s a pleasure trip, not business.\u201d</p><p>Robert frowned. \u201cDougless, please don\u2019t start on me already. Would you please just keep track of the money we spend so that when we get home, you and I can split the expenses in half?\u201d</p><p>Dougless looked at Gloria\u2019s ticket she was holding. \u201cYou mean in thirds, don\u2019t you? Me one third, two thirds for you and Gloria.\u201d</p><p>Robert gave her a look of horror as he put his arm around Gloria protectively, as though Dougless had tried to hit the kid. \u201cI meant in half. Gloria is for you to enjoy, too. Money spent is nothing compared to the joy you\u2019ll receive from her company.\u201d</p><p>Dougless turned away. She wasn\u2019t going to get into an argument now; they\u2019d discuss this further later\u2014when they were in private and Gloria wasn\u2019t watching them with interest.</p><p>For the rest of the long flight, she read while Gloria and Robert played cards and ignored her. Twice Dougless took a tranquilizer to keep her stomach from eating itself.</p><p>Now, in the car, Dougless rubbed her aching stomach. In the four days they\u2019d been in England she\u2019d tried to enjoy herself. She\u2019d tried not to complain when the first night in their beautiful hotel room, Gloria had moaned so much about the trundle bed the hotel had put in the room\u2014after the owner had crossly lectured Dougless about not having expected Gloria\u2014that Robert had asked Gloria to get into their four poster with them. After nearly being pushed out of bed twice, Dougless had ended up sleeping on the trundle bed. Nor had Dougless complained when Gloria ordered three entrees at the expensive restaurant. \u201cI just want my baby to have a taste of everything,\u201d Robert said. \u201cAnd, Dougless, please stop being so stingy. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s come over you. I always thought you were a generous person,\u201d Robert said, then handed Dougless the enormous bill that Dougless was to pay half of.</p><p>Dougless managed to keep her mouth shut by constantly reminding herself that she was the adult and Gloria was just a child. And Dougless consoled herself with the knowledge that somewhere in Robert\u2019s baggage was a five-thousand-dollar engagement ring. The thought of that ring made her remember that he did love her. And she reminded herself that all the things he did for Gloria were done out of love, too.</p><p>But after last night, Dougless was finding it impossible to keep up her appearance of good humor. Last night at yet another hundred-and-fifty-dollar dinner, Robert had presented Gloria with a long blue velvet box. As Dougless watched Gloria open the box, she had a sinking feeling.</p><p>Gloria\u2019s eyes lit up when she saw what was inside. \u201cBut it\u2019s not my birthday, Daddy,\u201d she\u2019d whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know, Muffin,\u201d Robert said softly. \u201cIt\u2019s just to say, \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Gloria withdrew from the box a wide bracelet made of twisted wires of gold and silver, from which dripped diamonds and emeralds.</p><p>Dougless couldn\u2019t prevent the gasp that escaped her, for she knew that her engagement ring was being fastened about Gloria\u2019s chubby wrist.</p><p>Gloria held her arm up triumphantly. \u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I see,\u201d Dougless said coolly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After dinner, in the hall outside their room, Robert had been furious with her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t show much enthusiasm about the bracelet I gave my daughter. Gloria was trying to show it to you. She was trying to make overtures of friendship to you, but you snubbed her. You\u2019ve hurt her deeply.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you paid five thousand dollars for? A diamond bracelet for a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloria happens to be a young woman, a very beautiful young woman, and she deserves beautiful things. And besides, it\u2019s my money. It\u2019s not as though you and I were married and you had any legal rights to my money.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time they\u2019d been alone in days, and Dougless wanted to keep her pride, wanted to tell herself that it didn\u2019t matter that Robert bought his young daughter diamonds but gave the woman he lived with half his bills. But Dougless had never been able to conceal her true feelings. With her eyes filling with unshed tears, Dougless put her hands on his arms. \u201cAre we going to get married?\u201d she whispered. \u201cIs it ever going to happen?\u201d</p> <p>Angrily, he jerked away from her touch. \u201cNot if you don\u2019t start showing a little love and generosity to both my daughter and me.\u201d He gave her a cold look. \u201cYou know, I thought you were different, but now I\u2019m beginning to think that you\u2019re as cold as my ex-wife. Now, if you\u2019ll please excuse me, I have to go comfort my daughter. She\u2019s probably crying her little eyes out after the way you treated her.\u201d After one last glare at Dougless, he turned and went into their room.</p><p>Dougless slumped against the wall. \u201cEmerald earrings should dry her tears,\u201d she whispered to no one.</p><p>So now, in the car, she sat with her body twisted around Gloria\u2019s suitcases and knew that no marriage proposal, and certainly no engagement ring, was going to be given to her. Instead she knew that she was going to spend the month-long trip acting as a secretary and navigator for Robert, and being taunted by his daughter. At the moment Dougless wasn\u2019t sure what she was going to do, but the thought of taking the first plane home appealed to her.</p><p>Even as she thought of leaving, she looked at the back of Robert\u2019s head and her heart lurched. If she got on a plane in a rage, she knew she\u2019d have to return to the U.S. and move out of Robert\u2019s house. She\u2019d have to find an apartment; then she\u2019d\u2014 What? Start dating again? As a schoolteacher, she didn\u2019t meet too many men. She could go to her family and\u2014 Admit that she\u2019d had yet another relationship fail?</p><p>\u201cDougless,\u201d Robert said. \u201cI think maybe we\u2019re lost. Where is this church? I thought you were going to watch the road maps. I can\u2019t drive and navigate.\u201d There was an edge to his voice that hadn\u2019t been there yesterday and Dougless knew he was still angry about her reaction to the bracelet.</p> <p>Quickly, Dougless fumbled with the map, then looked around Gloria\u2019s head to try to see the road signs. \u201cHere!\u201d she said. \u201cTake a right.\u201d</p><p>Robert turned down one of the narrow English lanes, bushes on either side nearly covering the road, and drove toward the remote village of Ashburton, a place that looked as though it hadn\u2019t changed in hundreds of years.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a thirteenth-century church here containing the tomb of an Elizabethan earl.\u201d Dougless checked her notebook. \u201cLord Nicholas Stafford, died 1564.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have to see another church?\u201d Gloria wailed. \u201cI\u2019m sick of churches. Couldn\u2019t she find something better to look at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was told to search out historic sights,\u201d Dougless snapped before she thought to modulate her tone.</p><p>Robert stopped the car in front of the church and looked back at Dougless. \u201cGloria\u2019s statement was valid, and I see no call for your bad temper. Dougless, you are making me begin to regret bringing you with us,\u201d he said, then got out of the car and walked away.</p> <p>\u201cBringing me?\u201d Dougless said, but he was already halfway to the church, his arm around Gloria. \u201cBut I\u2019m paying my own way,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t go inside the church with Robert and Gloria. Instead she stayed outside, walking around the lumpy graveyard, absently looking at the ancient grave markers. She had some serious decisions to make and she wanted time to think. Should she stay and be miserable, or should she leave? If she left now, she knew Robert would never forgive her and all the time and effort she\u2019d invested in him would have been for nothing.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>Dougless jumped at the voice, then turned to see Gloria just behind her. Maybe it was Dougless\u2019s imagination, but the girl\u2019s diamond bracelet seemed to flash in the sun.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Dougless asked suspiciously.</p><p>Gloria stuck her lower lip out. \u201cYou hate me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Dougless sighed. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t hate you. I just . . . It\u2019s a grown-up thing.\u201d She took a deep breath. She wanted to be alone so she could think. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you inside looking at the church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got bored. That\u2019s a pretty blouse,\u201d Gloria said, her eyelids lowered in a sly way that Dougless had seen too many times before. \u201cIt looks expensive. Did your rich family buy it for you?\u201d</p> <p>Dougless wasn\u2019t about to take the bait and let the girl get to her. Instead, she gave her a quelling look, then turned and walked away.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Gloria cried out, then yelled, \u201cOw!\u201d</p><p>Dougless turned back to see Gloria crumpled in a heap beside a rough-surfaced tombstone. Dougless doubted if the girl was actually hurt because Gloria loved drama. Sighing, Dougless went back to help her up, but as soon as she was upright, Gloria burst into tears. Dougless couldn\u2019t quite bring herself to hug Gloria, but she did manage to pat her shoulder. She even gave a little expression of sympathy because Gloria\u2019s arm was raw where she\u2019d hit the stone. Gloria looked at her arm and began to cry louder.</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t hurt that much,\u201d Dougless said, trying to soothe the girl. \u201cI know. Why don\u2019t you put your new bracelet on that arm? I\u2019ll bet the pain\u2019ll stop instantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d Gloria said, sniffing. \u201cI\u2019m upset because you hate me. Daddy said you thought my bracelet was going to be an engagement ring.\u201d</p><p>Dougless dropped her hand from Gloria\u2019s arm and stiffened. \u201cWhat made him think such a ridiculous thing as that?\u201d she asked, trying to sound convincing.</p><p>Gloria looked at Dougless out of the corner of her eye. \u201cOh, my daddy knows everything about you,\u201d she said, her voice sly. \u201cHe knows you thought his surprise was going to be a marriage proposal, and he knows that you thought the check to the jeweler was for an engagement ring.\u201d Gloria gave a little smile. \u201cDaddy and I laugh all the time about you and how much you want to marry him. He says you\u2019ll do anything he tells you to if he makes you think he\u2019s going to ask you to marry him.\u201d</p><p>Dougless was standing so rigid that her body began to tremble.</p><p>Gloria\u2019s little smile turned malicious and her voice lowered. \u201cDaddy says that if you weren\u2019t going to inherit so much money, he\u2019d get rid of you.\u201d</p><p>At that remark, Dougless slapped Gloria\u2019s smug, fat face.</p><p>Robert appeared from inside the church just in time to see the slap, and Gloria went screaming into her father\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cShe hit me over and over,\u201d Gloria screamed, \u201cand she scratched my arm. Look at it, Daddy, it\u2019s bleeding. She did this to me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, Dougless,\u201d Robert said, his eyes wide in horror. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this of you. To beat a child, to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChild! I\u2019ve had enough of that child! And I\u2019ve had enough of the way you baby her. And I\u2019ve had enough of the way you two treat me!\u201d</p><p>Robert glared at her coldly. \u201cWe have been nothing but kind and thoughtful to you this entire trip, while you have been jealous and spiteful. We have gone out of our way to please you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t made any effort to please me. Everything has been for Gloria.\u201d Tears came to Dougless\u2019s eyes and filled her throat until she almost choked. She kept hearing Gloria\u2019s words ringing in her head. \u201cYou two have laughed at me behind my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re fantasizing,\u201d Robert said, still glaring at her, still holding Gloria protectively under his arm as though Dougless might attack the girl at any moment. \u201cBut since we are so displeasing to you, perhaps you\u2019d rather do without our company.\u201d Turning, Gloria huddled against his side, he started walking toward the car.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Dougless said. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go home.\u201d Bending, she reached for her handbag where she\u2019d set it down by a gravestone. But her bag wasn\u2019t there. Quickly, she looked behind a few tombstones, but there was no sign of her bag. She looked up when she heard a car start.</p><p>At first she couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing. Robert was driving away and leaving her!</p><p>Dougless ran toward the gate, but the car had already pulled onto the road. Then, to Dougless\u2019s horror, she saw Gloria stick her arm out the window\u2014and dangling from her fingertips was Dougless\u2019s handbag.</p><p>In a futile attempt to reach them, Dougless ran after the car, but it was soon out of sight. Dazed, numb, disbelieving, she walked back to the church. She was in a foreign country with no money, no credit cards, no passport. But, worst of all, the man she loved had just walked out on her.</p><p>The heavy oak door of the church was standing open, so Dougless went inside. It was cool and damp and dim inside the church, and the tall stone walls made the place feel calm and reverent.</p><p>She had to think about her situation and make some plans about what she should do. But, then, surely, Robert would return for her. Maybe even now he was turning around and driving back to get her. Maybe any minute he\u2019d come running into the church, pull Dougless into his arms, and tell her he was sorry and he hoped she could forgive him.</p><p>But, somehow, Dougless didn\u2019t believe any of that was going to happen. No, Robert had been too angry\u2014and Gloria was too much of a liar. Dougless was sure the girl would elaborate on how Dougless had injured her arm, and Robert\u2019s anger would be refueled.</p><p>No, it would be better if Dougless made some plans about how to get herself out of this mess. She\u2019d have to call her father, collect, and have him send her money. And again she would have to tell him that his youngest daughter had failed at something. She\u2019d have to tell him that his daughter couldn\u2019t so much as go on a holiday without getting herself into trouble.</p><p>Tears started in her eyes as she imagined hearing her oldest sister, Elizabeth, say, \u201cWhat has our little scatterbrained Dougless done now?\u201d Robert had been Dougless\u2019s attempt at making her family proud of her. Robert wasn\u2019t like the other stray-cat men Dougless had fallen for. Robert was so respectable, so very suitable, but she\u2019d lost him. Maybe if she\u2019d just held her temper with Gloria . . . Maybe . . .</p><p>Tears blurred Dougless\u2019s eyes as she looked around the church. Sun was streaming through the old windows high above her head, and sharp, clear rays lit the white marble tomb in the archway to the left. Dougless walked forward. Lying on top of the tomb was a full-length, white marble sculpture of a man wearing the top half of a suit of armor and an odd-looking pair of shorts, his ankles crossed, a helmet tucked under his arm. \u201c \u2018Nicholas Stafford,\u2019\u201d she read aloud, \u201c\u2018Earl of Thornwyck.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Dougless was congratulating herself for holding up so well under her current circumstances when, suddenly, everything that had happened hit her, and her knees collapsed. She fell to the floor, her hands on the tomb, her forehead resting against the cold marble.</p><p>She began to cry in earnest, to cry deeply from far down inside herself. She felt as though she were a failure, a complete and absolute failure.Her tears were not just for today, but it seemed that everything she\u2019d ever touched in her life had failed. Since she\u2019d reached puberty, her father had had to bail her out of what had to be hundreds of scrapes.</p><p>There was the \u201cboy\u201d she\u2019d fallen madly in love with when she was sixteen. She had defied her entire family because they hadn\u2019t liked him. But her sister Elizabeth\u2014wise, never-made-a-mistake-in-her-life Elizabeth\u2014showed Dougless some papers. The boy she loved was twenty-five years old and had a prison record. Defiantly, Dougless declared that she loved him no matter what flaws he had. They broke up when he was arrested for grand theft.</p><p>Then there was the minister she\u2019d fallen for when she was nineteen. A minister had seemed a safe person for her to love. She ended their relationship when his pictur(</p><p><a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a>_9_ed</p><p>on the front page of the newspapers. He was already married to three other women.</p><p>And then there was . . . Dougless was crying so hard that she couldn\u2019t remember all the others. But she knew that the list was endless. Robert had seemed so different, so ordinary, so respectable\u2014but she hadn\u2019t been able to hold on to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with me?\u201d she cried.</p><p>Through her tears, she looked at the marble face of the man on the tomb. In the Middle Ages they had arranged marriages. When she was twenty-two and had just found out that her latest love, a stockbroker, had been arrested for insider trading, she\u2019d crawled onto her father\u2019s lap and asked him if he\u2019d choose a man for her.</p><p>Adam Montgomery had laughed. \u201cYour problem, sweetheart, is that you fall in love with men who need you too much. You ought to find a man who doesn\u2019t need you, but just wants you.\u201d</p><p>Dougless had sniffed. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I want: a Knight in Shining Armor to swoop down off his white horse and want me so much that he carries me back to his castle, where we live happily ever after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d her father had said, smiling. \u201cArmor\u2019s okay but, Dougless, sweetheart, if he gets mysterious phone calls in the night, then jumps on his Harley and doesn\u2019t return for days at a time, get out, okay?\u201d</p><p>Dougless cried harder as she remembered the many times she\u2019d had to go to her family for help. And now she was going to have to ask for their help again. Once again she was going to have to admit that she\u2019d made a fool of herself over a man. But this time was worse, because this man had been someone who had her family\u2019s approval. But somehow Dougless had lost him.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d she whispered, her hand on the marble hand of the sculpture. \u201cHelp me find my Knight in Shining Armor. Help me find a man who wants me.\u201d</p><p>Sitting back on her heels, with her hands covering her face, Dougless began to cry harder.</p><p>After a long while, she slowly came to realize that someone was near her. When she turned her head, a stream of sunlight coming from a high window hit metal and so blinded her that she sat back on the stone floor with a thud. She put her hand up to shield her eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Standing before her was a man, a man who appeared to be wearing. . . armor.</p><p>He was standing so still, and glaring down at Dougless so fiercely, that at first she thought he wasn\u2019t real. She couldn\u2019t help staring up at him in openmouthed astonishment. He was an extraordinarily good looking man, and he was wearing the most authentic-looking stage costume she\u2019d ever seen. There was a small ruff about his neck, then armor to his waist. But what armor! The shiny metal looked almost as though it was silver. Down the front of the armor were many rows of etched flower designs, each design filled with a gold-colored metal. From his waist to mid-thigh he wore a type of shorts that ballooned out about his body. Below the shorts, his legs\u2014his big, muscular legs\u2014were clad in stockings that looked to be knitted of . . . there was only one fiber on earth that reflected light in just that way: silk. Tied above his left knee was a garter made of blue silk and beautifully embroidered. His feet sported odd, soft shoes that had little cut-outs across the toes.</p><p>\u201cWell, witch,\u201d the man said in a deep baritone, \u201cyou have conjured me, so what now do you ask of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitch?\u201d Dougless asked, sniffing and wiping away tears.</p> <p>From inside his ballooned shorts, the man pulled out a white linen handkerchief and handed it to her. Dougless blew her nose noisily.</p><p>\u201cHave my enemies hired you?\u201d the man asked. \u201cDo they plot against me more? Is not my head enough for them? Stand, madam, and explain yourself.\u201d</p><p>Gorgeous, but off his rocker, Dougless thought. \u201cListen, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Slowly, she stood up. \u201cNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say any more because he drew a thin-bladed sword that had to be a yard long, then held the sharp point against her throat. \u201cReverse your spell, witch. I would return!\u201d</p><p>It was all too much for Dougless. First Robert and his lying daughter, and now this mad Hamlet. She burst into tears again and slumped against the cold stone wall.</p> <p>\u201cDamnation!\u201d the man muttered, and the next thing Dougless knew he had picked her up and was carrying her to a church pew.</p><p>He put her down to sit on the hard pew, then stood over her, still glaring. Dougless couldn\u2019t seem to stop crying. \u201cThis has been the worst day of my life,\u201d she wailed. The man was scowling down at her like an actor out of an old Bette Davis movie. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she managed to say. \u201cI don\u2019t usually cry so much, but to be abandoned by the man I love and attacked\u2014at sword point, no less\u2014all in the same day, sets me off.\u201d As she wiped her eyes, she glanced down at the handkerchief. It was a large linen square, and around the border was an inch and a half band of intricate silk embroidery of what looked to be flowers and dragons. \u201cHow pretty,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>\u201cThere is no time for trivialities. My soul is at stake\u2014as is yours. I tell you again: Reverse your spell.\u201d</p><p>Dougless was recovering herself. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I was having a good cry all alone, and you, wearing that absurd outfit, came in here and started yelling at me. I\u2019ve a good mind to call the police\u2014or the bobbies, or whatever they have in rural England. Is it legal for you to carry a sword like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegal?\u201d the man asked. He was looking at her arm. \u201cIs that a clock on your arm? And what manner of dress is it that you wear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s a clock, and these are my traveling-to-England clothes. Conservative. No jeans or T-shirts. Nice blouse, nice skirt. You know, Miss Marple\u2013type clothes.\u201d</p> <p>He was frowning at her, but there seemed to be less anger about him. \u201cYou talk uncommonly strangely. What manner of witch are you?\u201d</p><p>Throwing up her hands in despair, Dougless stood up and faced him. He was quite a bit taller than she was, so she had to look up. His black, curling hair just reached the stiff little ruff he wore, and he had a black mustache above a trim, pointed, short beard. \u201cI am not a witch, and I am not part of your Elizabethan drama,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m going to leave this church, and I can promise you that if you try anything fancy with that sword of yours, I\u2019ll scream the windows out. Here\u2019s your handkerchief. I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s so wet, but I thank you for lending it to me. Good-bye, and I hope your play gets great reviews.\u201d Turning sharply, she walked out of the church.</p><p>\u201cAt least nothing more horrible than what I\u2019ve already been through can happen to me today,\u201d Dougless murmured as she left the churchyard. There was a telephone booth beyond the gate, within sight of the church door, and Dougless used it to make a collect call to her parents\u2019 home in the U.S. It was early in the morning in Maine, and a sleepy Elizabeth answered the phone.</p><p>Anybody but her, Dougless thought, rolling her eyes skyward. She\u2019d rather talk to anyone on earth than her perfect older sister.</p><p>\u201cDougless, is that you?\u201d Elizabeth asked, waking up. \u201cAre you all right? You\u2019re not in trouble again, are you?\u201d</p><p>Dougless grit her teeth. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not in trouble. Is Dad there? Or Mom?\u201d Or a stranger off the street, she thought. Anybody but Elizabeth.</p><p>Elizabeth yawned. \u201cNo, they went up to the mountains. I\u2019m here house-sitting and working on a paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink it\u2019ll win a Nobel prize?\u201d Dougless asked, trying to make a joke and sound carefree.</p> <p>Elizabeth wasn\u2019t fooled. \u201cAll right, Dougless, what\u2019s wrong? Has that surgeon of yours stranded you somewhere?\u201d</p><p>Dougless gave a little laugh. \u201cElizabeth, you do say the funniest things. Robert and Gloria and I are having a wonderful time. There are so many fantastic things to see and do here. Why, just this morning we saw a medieval play. The actors were so good. And you wouldn\u2019t believe how good the costumes are!\u201d</p><p>Elizabeth paused. \u201cDougless, you\u2019re lying. I can hear it over the phone. What\u2019s wrong? Do you need money?\u201d</p><p>Try as she might, Dougless could not make her lips form the word \u201cyes.\u201d Her family loved to tell what they called Dougless-stories. They loved the one about the time Dougless got locked out of her hotel room when she was wearing only a towel. Then there was the time Dougless went to the bank to deposit a check and walked into a bank robbery. What they especially loved about this story was that when the police arrived, they discovered that the robbers were carrying toy guns.</p><p>Now she could imagine Elizabeth\u2019s laughter when she told all the Montgomery cousins how funny little Dougless had gone to England and been left at a church with no money, no passport, nothing. \u201cAnd, oh, yes,\u201d Elizabeth would say over the howls of laughter, \u201cshe was attacked by a crazed Shakespearean actor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t need money,\u201d Dougless said at last. \u201cI just wanted to say hello. I hope you get your paper done. See ya.\u201d She heard Elizabeth say, \u201cDougless\u201d as she dropped the receiver into the cradle.</p><p>For a moment Dougless leaned back against the booth and closed her eyes. She could feel the tears starting again. She had the Montgomery pride, but she\u2019d never done anything to be proud of. She had three older sisters who were paragons of success: Elizabeth was a research chemist, Catherine was a professor of physics, and Anne was a criminal attorney. Dougless, with her lowly elementary school teaching job and her disastrous history with men, was the family jester. She was an endless source of material for laughter among the relatives.</p><p>As she was leaning against the telephone booth, her eyes blurred with tears, she saw the man in the armor leave the church and walk down the path. He glanced quickly at the ancient gravestones, but didn\u2019t seem to have much interest in them as he headed past the gate.</p><p>Coming down the lane was one of the little English buses, as usual doing about fifty miles an hour on the narrow street.</p><p>Suddenly, Dougless stood up straight. The bus was coming, the man was walking very fast, and, somehow, she instinctively knew he was going to walk in front of the bus. Without another thought, Dougless started to run. Just as she took flight, the vicar walked from behind the church in time to see the man and the fast-moving vehicle. He too started running.</p><p>Dougless reached the man first. She made her best flying tackle, the one she\u2019d learned from playing football with her Colorado cousins, and landed on top of him. The two of them skidded across the graveled path on his armor as though it were a little rowboat as the bus flew past them. If Dougless had been only one second later, the man would have been hit by the bus.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d the vicar asked, offering his hand to help Dougless up.</p><p>\u201cI . . . I think so,\u201d she said as she stood up and dusted herself off. \u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked the man on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat manner of chariot was that?\u201d he asked, sitting up, but not attempting to stand. He looked dazed. \u201cI did not hear it coming.\u201d His voice lowered. \u201cAnd there were no horses.\u201d</p><p>Dougless exchanged looks with the vicar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get him a glass of water,\u201d the vicar said, giving a little smile to Dougless as though to say, You saved him, so he\u2019s yours.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d the man said. \u201cWhat year is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNineteen eighty-eight,\u201d the vicar answered, and when the man lay back on the ground as if exhausted, the vicar looked at Dougless. \u201cI\u2019ll get the water,\u201d he said, then went hurrying off, leaving them alone.</p><p>Dougless offered her hand to the man on the ground, but he refused it and stood up on his own.</p><p>\u201cI think you ought to sit down,\u201d she said kindly as she motioned to an iron bench inside the low stone wall. He wouldn\u2019t go first but followed her through the open gate, then wouldn\u2019t sit until she had. But Dougless pushed him to sit down. He looked too pale and too bewildered to pay attention to courtesy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dangerous, you know that? Listen, you sit right here and</p><p>I\u2019m going to call a doctor. You are not well.\u201d</p><p>She turned away, but his words halted her. \u201cI think perhaps I am dead,\u201d he said softly. She looked back at him in speculation. If he was suicidal, then she couldn\u2019t leave him alone. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with me?\u201d she said quietly. \u201cWe\u2019ll go together to find you some help.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move from the bench. \u201cWhat manner of conveyance was it that nearly struck me down?\u201d</p><p>Dougless moved to sit beside him. If he was suicidal, maybe what he needed most was someone to talk to. \u201cWhere are you from? You sound English, but you have an accent I\u2019ve never heard before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am English. What was the chariot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said with a sigh. She could play along with him. \u201cThat was what the English call a coach. In America, it\u2019s called a minibus. It was going entirely too fast, but it\u2019s my opinion that the only thing of the twentieth century the English have really accepted is the speed of the motor vehicle.\u201d She grimaced. \u201cSo what else don\u2019t you know about? Airplanes? Trains?\u201d</p><p>It was one thing to offer help, but she had important things of her own to take care of. \u201cLook, I really need to go. Let\u2019s go to the rectory and have the vicar call a doctor.\u201d She paused. \u201cOr maybe we should call your mother.\u201d Surely the people of this village knew of this crazy man who ran about in armor and pretended he\u2019d never seen a wristwatch or a bus.</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d the man said, his lips forming a little smile. \u201cI would imagine my mother is dead now.\u201d</p><p>Maybe grief had made him lose his memory. Dougless softened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Did she die recently?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at the sky for a moment before answering. \u201cAbout four hundred years ago.\u201d</p><p>At that Dougless started to rise. \u201cI\u2019m calling someone.\u201d</p><p>But he caught her hand and wouldn\u2019t let her leave. \u201cI was sitting . . . in a room writing my mother a letter when I heard a woman weeping. The room darkened, my head swam; then I was standing over a woman\u2014you.\u201d He looked up at her with pleading eyes.</p><p>Dougless thought that leaving this man alone would be so much easier if he weren\u2019t so utterly divine looking. \u201cMaybe you blacked out and don\u2019t remember dressing up and going to the church. Why don\u2019t you tell me where you live so I can walk you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was in the room, it was the year of our Lord 1564.\u201d</p><p>Delusional, Dougless thought. Beautiful but crazy. My luck.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d she said softly, as though speaking to a child about to step over a cliff. \u201cWe\u2019ll find someone to help you.\u201d</p><p>The man came off the bench quickly, his blue eyes blazing. The size of him, the anger of him, not to mention that he was steel-covered and carried a sword that looked to be razor sharp, made Dougless step back.</p><p>\u201cI am not yet ready for Bedlam, mistress. I know not why I am here or how I came to be here, but I know who I am and from whence I came.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, laughter began to rumble deep inside Dougless. \u201cAnd you came from the sixteenth century. Queen Elizabeth\u2019s time, right? The first Elizabeth, of course. Oh, boy! This is going to be the best Dougless-story ever. I\u2019m jilted in the morning and an hour later a ghost holds a sword to my throat.\u201d She stood up. \u201cThanks a lot, mister. You\u2019ve cheered me up immensely. I am now going to call my sister and ask her to wire me ten pounds\u2014no more, no less\u2014then I\u2019m catching a train to the hotel where Robert and I are staying. I\u2019ll get my plane ticket, then I\u2019m going home. I\u2019m sure that after today the rest of my life is going to be uneventful.\u201d</p><p>She turned away from him, but he blocked her path. From inside his balloon shorts he withdrew a leather pouch, looked in it, took out a few coins, and pressed them into Dougless\u2019s hand, closing her fingers over them.</p><p>\u201cTake the ten pounds, woman, and be gone. It is worth that and more to be rid of your spiteful tongue. I will beseech God to reverse your wickedness.\u201d</p><p>She was tempted to throw the money at him, but her alternative was to call her sister again. \u201cThat\u2019s me, Wicked Witch Dougless. I don\u2019t know why I want a train when I have a perfectly good broomstick. I\u2019ll send your money back in care of the vicar. So long, and I hope we never meet again.\u201d</p><p>She turned and left the churchyard just as the vicar returned with the man\u2019s water. Let someone else deal with his fantasies, she thought. The man probably had a whole trunk full of costumes. Today he\u2019s an Elizabethan knight, tomorrow he\u2019s Abraham Lincoln\u2014or Horatio Nelson, since he\u2019s English.</p><p>It was easy to find the train station in the little village, and she went to the window to purchase her ticket. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be three pounds six,\u201d the man behind the window said.</p><p>Dougless had never been able to figure out the English money. There seemed to be so many coins that had the same value, so she shoved the coins the man had given her under the cage window. \u201cIs this enough?\u201d</p><p>The man looked at the three coins one by one, slowly turning them over, examining them carefully. After a moment, he looked back at Dougless, then excused himself.</p><p>I\u2019ll probably be arrested for passing counterfeit money, Dougless thought as she waited for the man to return. Being arrested would be a fitting end to a perfect day.</p> <p>After a few minutes a man with an official-looking hat came to the window. \u201cWe can\u2019t take these, miss. I think you ought to take them to Oliver Samuelson. He\u2019s just around the corner to your right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he give me train fare for the coins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI \u2019spect he will that,\u201d the man said, seeming to be amused at some private joke.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Dougless murmured as she took the coins. Maybe she should call her sister and forget about the coins. She looked at them, but they looked as foreign as all foreign coins did. With a sigh, she turned right and came to a shop. \u201cOliver Samuelson, Coin Dealer\u201d the painted window said.</p><p>Inside the shop, a bald-headed little man was sitting behind a desk, a jeweler\u2019s loupe about his shiny forehead. \u201cYes?\u201d he asked when Dougless entered.</p> <p>\u201cThe man in the train station sent me to you. He said you might give me train fare for these.\u201d</p><p>The man took the coins and looked at them under the jeweler\u2019s loupe. After a moment he began to softly chuckle. \u201cTrain fare, indeed.\u201d</p><p>He looked up. \u201cAll right, miss,\u201d he said. \u201cI will give you five hundred pounds each for these, and this one is worth about, say, five thousand pounds. But I don\u2019t have that much money here. I\u2019ll have to call some people in London. Can you wait a few days for the money?\u201d</p><p>Dougless couldn\u2019t speak for a moment. \u201cFive thousand pounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, six thousand, but not a shilling more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to sell them or not? They\u2019re not ill-gotten are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, at least I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Dougless whispered. \u201cBut I have to talk to someone before I sell them. You\u2019re sure they\u2019re genuine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a rule medieval coins aren\u2019t so valuable, but these are rare and in mint condition. You don\u2019t by chance have more, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I believe there are a few more.\u201d Maybe a whole bag full of them, she thought.</p><p>The man smiled at her as though she were the light of his life. \u201cIf you have a fifteen-shilling piece with a queen in a ship on it, let me see it. I can\u2019t afford it, but I\u2019m sure I can find a buyer.\u201d</p><p>Dougless started backing toward the door.</p><p>\u201cOr a double,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to have an Edward the Sixth double.\u201d</p><p>Nodding at him, Dougless left his shop. In a daze, she walked back to the church. The man wasn\u2019t in the churchyard, so she hoped he hadn\u2019t left. She went into the church, and there he was, on his knees before the white tomb of the earl, his hands clasped, his head bowed in prayer.</p> <p>The vicar stepped from the shadows to stand beside her. \u201cHe\u2019s been there since you left. I tried, but I couldn\u2019t get him to stand up. Something is deeply troubling that poor man.\u201d He turned to her. \u201cHe\u2019s your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, actually, I just met him this morning. I thought he was from here.\u201d</p><p>The vicar smiled. \u201cMy parishioners seldom wear armor.\u201d He looked at his watch. \u201cI must go, but you\u2019ll stay with him? For some reason, I hate to see him left alone.\u201d</p><p>Dougless said that she would stay by him, then the vicar left the church, and she was alone with the praying man. Quietly, she walked to stand behind him. \u201cWho are you?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He didn\u2019t open his eyes, unclasp his hands, or even lift his head. \u201cI am Nicholas Stafford, earl of Thornwyck.\u201d</p><p>It took Dougless a moment to remember where she\u2019d heard that name before, then she looked at the marble tomb. Carved deeply in Gothic letters was the name, Nicholas Stafford, Earl of Thornwyck. And the full-length sculpture of the man on top of the tomb was wearing exactly what this man was wearing. And the face carved in the marble was this man\u2019s face.</p><p>The idea that this man really was from the past, really was a living, breathing ghost, was more than Dougless could comprehend. She took a deep breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any identification, do you?\u201d she asked, trying to lighten the moment.</p><p>Lifting his head, the man opened his eyes and glared at her. \u201cDo you doubt my word?\u201d he asked angrily. \u201cYou, the witch who has done this to me, can doubt me? If I did not fear being accused of sorcery myself, I would denounce you and stay to watch you burn.\u201d</p><p>Standing there, silent, her thoughts in turmoil, Dougless watched as the man turned away and began to pray again.</p><p>TWO</p><p>When at last Nicholas Stafford stood up, he stared at the young woman before him. Her manner, her dress, and her speech were so strange to him that he could hardly keep his thoughts together. She looked to be the witch he knew her to be: she was as beautiful as any woman he\u2019d ever seen, her uncased hair flowing to her shoulders, her eyes as green as emeralds, and her skin was white, flawless. But she was wearing an indecently short skirt, as though she were daring the contempt of man and God alike.</p><p>In spite of the fact that he felt dizzy and weak, he did not allow himself to waver from his firm stance. He returned her straightforward glare with one of his own.</p><p>He still could not believe what had happened to him. At the lowest point in his life, when there seemed to be no hope in his life, his mother had written him that at last she had discovered something that would give them the hope they had nearly abandoned. He had been writing her, questioning her, and revealing some information when he\u2019d heard a woman weeping. The sound of tears in a place of confinement was not so unusual, but something about this woman\u2019s weeping had made him put down his pen.</p><p>When the woman\u2019s sobs had grown until they\u2019d filled the little room, echoing off the stone walls and ceiling, Nicholas had put his hands over his ears to shut out the sound. But he had still heard her. Her weeping had grown louder, until he could no longer hear his own thoughts. Overwhelmed, he\u2019d put his head down on the table and given himself over to the pull of the woman.</p><p>Then, it had been as though he were dreaming. He knew he was still sitting, his head still on the table, but at the same time, he was trying to stand up. When he was at last on his feet, the floor seemed to fall away from under him. He felt light, as though he were floating. Then he held out his hand and saw, to his horror, that his hand seemed to have lost substance. He could see through his hand. Staggering toward the door, he tried to call out, but no sound came from his mouth. As he watched, the door seemed to fall away, and with it went the room. For a moment Nicholas appeared to be standing on nothing. There was a void around him, his body naught but a shadow through which he could see the darkness of nothing.</p><p>He had no idea how long he drifted in the nothingness, feeling neither hot nor cold, hearing nothing but the woman\u2019s deep weeping.</p><p>One moment he was nowhere, was but a shadow, and the next moment he was standing in the sunlight in a church. He had on different clothes. Now he was wearing demi-armor, the armor he wore only for the most auspicious occasions, and he had on his emerald satin slops.</p><p>Before him, weeping next to a tomb was a girl or woman, he could not tell which, for her hair was hanging slovenly over her face. She was weeping so hard, so intent on her own misery, that she did not see him.</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s eyes moved from her to look up at the tomb she was clutching\u2014and it was the sight of the tomb that made him step backward. On top of it was a white marble sculpture of . . . himself. Carved beneath was his name and today\u2019s date. They have buried me before I am dead? he wondered in horror.</p><p>Feeling sick from his experience and at seeing his own tomb, he looked about the church. There were burial plaques set in the walls. The dates read, 1734,1812,1902.</p><p>No, he thought, it could not be. But as he looked at the church he could see that everything was different. The church was so very plain. The beams were bare wood; the stone corbels were unpainted. The altar cloth looked as though it had been embroidered by a clumsy child.</p><p>He looked back down at the sobbing woman. A witch! he thought. She was the witch who had called him forth to another time and place. When she had at last stopped her sobbing long enough to become aware of his presence, he had immediately demanded that she return him\u2014he had to return, he thought, for his honor and the future of his family depended upon his returning. But at his words, she had once again collapsed into helpless sobbing.</p><p>It did not take him long to discover that she was as vile-tempered and sharp-tongued as she was evil. She had even been bold enough to say she had no knowledge of how he came to be in this place, and that she knew nothing of why he was there.</p><p>At last she had left the church, and Nicholas had been relieved when she\u2019d gone. He was feeling more steady, and he was beginning to believe that he had dreamed that flight through the void. Perhaps all that he was experiencing was merely a dream of remarkable reality.</p><p>By the time he left the church, he was feeling much stronger, and he was glad to see that the churchyard looked the same as all churchyards\u2014but he did not pause to examine the gravestones\u2019 dates. One of those in the church had been 1982\u2014a date he could not fathom.</p><p>He left through the church gate and walked into the silent road. Where were the people? he wondered. And the horses? Where were the carts carrying goods?</p><p>What happened next had happened too quickly for him to remember clearly. There was a sound to his left, a loud, fast sound such as he\u2019d never heard before; then, to his right, came the witch, running faster than a woman should. Nicholas was unprepared when the woman leaped on him. He was weaker than he realized because the frail weight of the woman knocked him to the ground.</p><p>Seconds after they fell to the earth together, close by them roared an obscenly fast horseless chariot. Afterward, Nicholas had asked the woman and the vicar\u2014who was properly dressed in an unadorned, long robe as befitted his station\u2014questions, but they had seemed to believe that Nicholas was without sanity. He allowed the witch to lead him back inside the churchyard. Was this his fate? he wondered. Was he destined to die alone in a strange place . . . in a strange time?</p><p>He had tried to explain to the witch that she must return him to his own time. He told her of his need, but she persisted in pretending that she knew nothing of how or why he was in this place. He\u2019d had difficulty understanding her speech, and that, combined with the ordinariness of her dress\u2014no jewels, no gold, no silver\u2014told him she was of peasant stock. Because of the strangeness of her speech, it had taken him a while to understand that she was begging money from him. She was demanding of him the outrageous sum of ten pounds! But he did not dare refuse her demand for fear of what other spells she might perform.</p><p>The instant she had the money, she left, and Nicholas went back inside the church. Slowly, he walked to the tomb, his tomb, and ran his fingers over the carving of the death date. Had he died when he\u2019d traveled through the void? When the witch had conjured him forth to this time\u2014the churchman had said it was now 1988, four hundred and twenty-four years later\u2014did that mean she had killed him in 1564?</p><p>How could he make her understand that he had to return? If he had died on 6 September 1564, that meant he had proven nothing. It would mean he had left too much undone. What horror had befallen the people he\u2019d left behind?</p><p>Nicholas had dropped to his knees on the cold stone floor and begun to pray. Perhaps if his prayers were as strong as the witch\u2019s magic, he could overrule her power and return himself.</p><p>But as he prayed, his mind raced. Phrases ran through his head: The woman is the key. You need to know. These words were what he heard over and over.</p><p>After a while he stopped reciting prayers and opened his mind to his thoughts. Witch or no, the woman had brought him forward, therefore only she had the power to return him to his own time.</p><p>Yet, for all that she had brought him forward, she did not seem to have a use for him. Perhaps, Nicholas thought, she had not meant to call him forth. Perhaps she had great power, but knew not how to use it.</p><p>But, again, perhaps he had been pulled across time for some reason neither of them knew.</p><p>So why had he come forward? he wondered. Was he to learn something? Was this witch to teach him something? Could it be possible that she was as innocent as she claimed to be? Had she been weeping over some base lovers\u2019 quarrel, and, for some reason neither of them knew, she had conjured him forward to this dangerous time when chariots drove at unimagined speeds? If he learned what he needed to know here, would he then return to his proper time?</p><p>The witch was the key. The phrase kept running through his mind. Whether she had brought him forth through malicious intent or by unhappy accident, he was sure that she held the power to return him. And if that were true, then, through her, he was to learn what he must in this time.</p><p>He must bind her to him, he thought. No matter what the cost to his peace, no matter if he had to lie, slander, blaspheme, he knew that he must bind the woman to him. He had to see to it that she did not leave him until he discovered what he needed to know from her.</p><p>He remained on his knees, praying for God\u2019s guidance, asking advice, and pleading with God to stay with him as he did what he must do and learned what he needed to know.</p><p>When the woman returned to the church, Nicholas was still praying, and while she was complaining about the money Nicholas had given her, he offered God his thanks for the woman\u2019s return.</p><p>THREE</p><p>Who are you?\u201d Dougless asked the man wearing the ridiculous costume. \u201cAnd where did you get these coins?\u201d She watched him get off his knees, and from the ease with which he moved in the heavy armor, she knew he must have been rehearsing with it for a long time. \u201cAre the coins stolen?\u201d</p><p>When she saw his eyes ignite, she stepped back. She didn\u2019t want him to press a sword against her throat again. But she saw him calm himself.</p><p>\u201cNay, madam, the coins are my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t accept them,\u201d Dougless said firmly, holding out the coins. \u201cThey\u2019re quite valuable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are not enough for your needs?\u201d he asked softly, even giving a slight smile.</p><p>Dougless gave him a suspicious look. A few minutes ago he was attacking her with a sword, but now he was smiling at her as though he meant to . . . well, to seduce her. The sooner she got away from this crazy man the better off she would be, she thought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the man made no effort to take the coins, she put them on the edge of the tomb. \u201cThanks for offering them to me, but no thanks. I\u2019ll make do some other way.\u201d She turned to leave the church.</p><p>\u201cPause, madam!\u201d he said loudly.</p><p>Dougless clenched her fists at her sides. This man\u2019s pseudo-Elizabethan grammar was getting on her nerves. She turned to face him. \u201cLook, I know you have problems. I mean, maybe you cracked your head and can\u2019t remember who you are, but that\u2019s not my problem. I have problems of my own. I don\u2019t have a penny to my name, I\u2019m hungry, I don\u2019t know anyone in this country, and I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m going to get a bed tonight, even if I could afford one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor do I,\u201d the man said softly, looking at her with sad, hopeful eyes.</p> <p>Dougless sighed. Needy men, she thought, the bane of my life. But this time, she told herself, she wasn\u2019t going to fall for it. This time she wasn\u2019t going to help an insane man who, when angry, pulled a sword on her. \u201cGo outside the church, take a right\u2014be sure and watch out for cars\u2014walk two blocks, then take a left. Three blocks past the train station is a coin dealer. He\u2019ll give you lots of modern money for your old coins. Then take the money, buy yourself some proper clothes, and check into a good hotel. Miss Marple says there are few problems in life that can\u2019t be solved by a week in a good hotel. If you take a long, hot bath, I\u2019ll bet your memory will return in no time.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas could only stare at her. Did this woman speak English? What was a \u201cblock\u201d? Who was \u201cMiss Marple\u201d?</p><p>At his blank look, Dougless sighed again. She could no more leave him alone than she could leave an injured puppy in the middle of the highway. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said at last. \u201cCome with me to the telephone and I\u2019ll point you on your way. But that\u2019s it. That\u2019s all I\u2019m doing! You\u2019re on your own after that.\u201d</p><p>Quietly, Nicholas followed her out of the church, but he stopped in his tracks when they stepped outside the gate. What he was seeing was too horrifying to believe.</p><p>After only a few steps, Dougless realized the man wasn\u2019t behind her. Turning, she saw him gaping at a young girl on the opposite side of the road. She was dressed in the current English idea of chic: all in black. She wore tall black high heels, black hose, a tiny black leather skirt, and a huge black sweater that reached to the top of her thighs. Her short hair was sprayed purple and red, and stuck up like a porcupine\u2019s quills.</p> <p>Dougless smiled. The punk rocker-influenced fashions were a shock to anyone, much less to a crazy man under the illusion that he was from the sixteenth century. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said good-naturedly. \u201cShe\u2019s ordinary. You should see the people attending a rock concert.\u201d</p><p>They walked to the phone booth, and Dougless again gave him directions but, to her annoyance, he didn\u2019t leave, but stood outside the booth. \u201cPlease go away,\u201d she said, but he didn\u2019t move. I\u2019ll ignore him, she thought as she picked up the telephone, but she put it down quickly and turned to him. \u201cI think we need to get some things straight between us. If this is an English pickup, I\u2019m not interested. I already have a guy. Or did have one.\u201d Dougless took a breath. \u201cI do have a man in my life. In fact I\u2019m going to call him right now, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll come and get me.\u201d</p><p>The man didn\u2019t reply to her little speech, but just stood there looking at her. With a sigh, Dougless called the operator to place a collect call to Robert at their hotel. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, the hotel clerk informed her that Robert and his daughter had checked out an hour ago.</p><p>Dougless hung up, then slumped against the telephone cubicle. Now what do I do? she thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d the man asked, looking at the telephone with great interest. \u201cYou talked to this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break, will you?\u201d she half-yelled, taking her anger out on him. Turning back, she jerked the phone up, called the operator, and got information for the number of the hotel that was next on the itinerary she\u2019d made for Robert and her. The clerk at the second hotel informed her that Robert Whitley had canceled his reservation only moments before.</p> <p>Dougless leaned against the phone cubicle and, in spite of herself, tears came to her eyes. \u201cSo where\u2019s my Knight in Shining Armor?\u201d she whispered. As she said the words, she looked at the man standing before her. A fading ray of sunlight struck his armor, a shadow fell across his blue-black hair, and a jewel in his sword hilt twinkled. This man had appeared the last time she\u2019d cried and begged for a Knight in Shining Armor.</p><p>\u201cYou have had bad news?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She straightened. \u201cIt looks as though I\u2019ve been abandoned,\u201d she said softly, looking at him. No, it couldn\u2019t be, and she wasn\u2019t going to even consider it. It was a one in a million chance that this actor, who was so involved in his role that he believed it, should appear exactly at the moment she\u2019d asked for a Knight in Shining Armor. The truth was that Dougless was a magnet for strange men. Men who had problems seemed to have radar for finding her.</p><p>\u201cI, too, seem to have lost all,\u201d he said so softly she hardly heard him.</p><p>Oh, no! she thought. She was not going to fall for that line. \u201cSomeone around here must know who you are. Maybe if you ask at the post office, someone can tell you how to get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPost office?\u201d</p><p>He looked so genuinely lost that she could feel herself softening toward him. No, Dougless, no, she told herself, but the next moment she heard herself say, \u201cCome on. I\u2019ll take you to the coin dealer so you can exchange your coins.\u201d</p><p>They walked together, and his erect, perfect carriage made Dougless straighten her shoulders. None of the English people they passed stared at them\u2014as far as Dougless could tell, the English stared only at people wearing sunglasses\u2014but then she and Nicholas passed a couple of American tourists with their two adolescent children. The man had two cameras about his neck.</p> <p>\u201cLookit that, Myrt,\u201d the man said, the adults rudely gaping at Nicholas in his armor, and the children laughing and pointing.</p><p>\u201cIll-mannered louts,\u201d Nicholas said under his breath. \u201cSomeone should teach them how to behave in the presence of their betters.\u201d</p><p>Things happened very quickly after that. A bus stopped just a few feet from them, and out stepped fifty Japanese tourists, their cameras clicking as they photographed every inch of the quaint little English village. When they saw Nicholas, they advanced on him, cameras covering their faces.</p><p>At the sight of the approaching tourists, Nicholas drew his sword and stepped forward. Watching from the sidelines, the American woman tourist yelled in fear, but the Japanese kept moving closer, their cameras clicking like cicadas on a hot summer night.</p><p>To prevent the coming clash, Dougless did the only thing she knew worked: she flung herself against the armor-clad man and yelled, \u201cNo!\u201d Unfortunately, when she hit him, the edge of his sword slashed the upper sleeve of her blouse and cut her arm. Startled by the pain, Dougless tripped and nearly fell, but the knight caught her, lifted her into his arms for the second time, and carried her back to the sidewalk. Behind them, the Japanese cameras were still clicking and the Americans applauded.</p><p>\u201cGee, Daddy, this is better than Warwick Castle,\u201d an American kid said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not in the guidebook, George,\u201d the woman said. \u201cI think they should put things like this in the guidebook, or otherwise a body could think it was real.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas set the woman down. Somehow, he did not know how, but he had made a fool of himself. Did this century allow a nobleman to be defamed? And what manner of weapon were the small black machines these people held before their faces? For that matter, what manner of little people were they who held the machines?</p><p>He did not ask his questions, as questions seemed to annoy the witch-woman. \u201cMadam, you are injured,\u201d he said, and Dougless could tell by the way he stiffened that he was mortified that he\u2019d injured her.</p><p>Her arm was bleeding and the wound hurt, but she decided to let him off the hook. \u201cIt\u2019s only a flesh wound,\u201d she said, parodying the TV westerns. But the man didn\u2019t smile at her joke. Instead, he continued to look embarrassed. \u201cIt\u2019s not anything,\u201d she said, looking at the bloody place on her arm. She took a tissue from her skirt pocket and pressed it over the cut. \u201cThe coin shop is down there. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>When Dougless entered the little shop, the dealer smiled at her in welcome. \u201cI hoped to see you again. I\u2014\u201d He broke off when he saw Nicholas. Slowly, without a word, the man came forward and began to walk around Nicholas, examining his clothing. After one circuit, he dropped the jeweler\u2019s loupe down over his eye and looked at the armor, murmuring, \u201cMmm hmm,\u201d over and over. While Nicholas stood stiffly erect, looking at the man in distaste, but also looking as though he didn\u2019t want to commit another faux pas, the coin dealer examined the jewels on Nicholas\u2019s sword hilt, the jewels of the ring on the hand that rested on the sword, and the jewels on the dagger in his belt\u2014a weapon Dougless hadn\u2019t noticed before. Flipping up his loupe, the man went to his knees and examined the embroidery on the garter about Nicholas\u2019s knee, then looked at the knitting of his hose, and, last of all, at his soft slippers.</p><p>Finally, the coin dealer straightened and peered at Nicholas\u2019s face, examining his beard and hair.</p><p>Throughout this, Nicholas had been enduring the tradesman\u2019s scrutiny with ill-concealed distaste.</p><p>At last the coin dealer stepped back. \u201cRemarkable,\u201d he said. \u201cI have never seen anything like it. I must get the jeweler from next door to see this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will do no such thing!\u201d Nicholas snapped. \u201cDo you think I wait all day here to be inspected like a hog at a fair? Will you do business, or do I go elsewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d the coin dealer muttered, scurrying back behind his counter.</p><p>Nicholas dropped a sackful of coins onto the counter. \u201cWhat do you trade me for these, and remember, man, I take care of those who cheat me.\u201d</p><p>At Nicholas\u2019s tone of voice, Dougless found herself cowering to one side. This armored man had a way of giving orders that could frighten one into doing his bidding. After he\u2019d dropped the coins, Nicholas went to stand before the window while the dealer, with trembling hands, opened the bag.</p><p>Dougless moved to the counter. \u201cWell?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhat did you see when you examined him?\u201d</p><p>The dealer glanced nervously at Nicholas\u2019s back, then leaned toward Dougless to whisper, \u201cHis armor is silver\u2014remarkably pure\u2014and it\u2019s etched with gold. Those emeralds on his sword are worth a fortune, as are the rubies and diamonds on his fingers.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cWhoever made his costume spent a great deal. Oh, my,\u201d he said, holding up a coin. \u201cHere it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA queen in a ship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust so,\u201d he said, holding the coin in a caressing way. \u201cI can find a buyer, but it will take a few days.\u201d His voice was like that of a lover.</p><p>Dougless took the coin out of his hand, and slipped it and all but one of the others back into the bag. Before these were sold, she wanted to do a little research and compare prices. \u201cYou said you\u2019d give me five hundred pounds for that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the others?\u201d the dealer asked, his voice almost begging.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll . . . I mean, we will think about it.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, the man went to the back of the store, then returned a few moments later and counted out five hundred pounds\u2019 worth of the large, pretty English money.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here if you should change your mind,\u201d the dealer called as Nicholas and Dougless left the shop.</p><p>On the street, Dougless handed Nicholas the bag of coins plus the modern bills. \u201cI sold one coin for five hundred pounds, but the rest of them are worth a fortune. In fact, it seems that everything you\u2019re wearing is worth a king\u2019s ransom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am an earl, not a king,\u201d Nicholas said, puzzled as he looked at the paper money with interest.</p><p>She peered closely at his armor. \u201cIs that really silver, and is the yellow metal actually gold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a pauper, madam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t seem so.\u201d She stepped back from him. \u201cI guess I better go now.\u201d Suddenly, she realized that she had wasted most of the day with this man, yet she still had no money nor any place to go. And there was no one in England she could call to get the immediate help she needed. Robert and his daughter had checked out of one hotel and had canceled the next one. Dougless grimaced. No doubt dear little Gloria had balked at staying at another historic hotel and spending the day looking at castles and other educational sights.</p><p>\u201cYou will help me choose?\u201d the man said at the end of what she realized had been a rather long speech.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p><p>The man seemed to be trying to say something that was very difficult for him. He swallowed as though his own words were poison. \u201cYou will help me choose clothes and find lodging for the night? I will pay you for your services.\u201d</p><p>It took Dougless a moment to understand what he meant. \u201cAre you offering me a job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmployment, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a job; I just need . . .\u201d Trailing off, she turned away and blinked back tears. Her tear ducts seemed to be attached to Niagara Falls.</p><p>\u201cMoney?\u201d he offered.</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cNo. Yes. I guess I do need money, but I also need to find Robert and explain.\u201d He thinks I hit his daughter, she thought. No wonder he\u2019s furious. But how does someone say, \u201cYour daughter is a liar,\u201d in a nice way?</p><p>\u201cI will pay you money if you will help me,\u201d the man said.</p><p>Dougless turned to look at him. There was something in his eyes, something lost and lonely that made her sway a little toward him. No! she told herself. You cannot hook up with a man who you are dead certain is crazy. There is absolutely no doubt with this one. He\u2019s undoubtedly rich, but he is insane. He\u2019s probably a rich eccentric who had his costume made by some medieval historian and he now wears it as he goes from village to village hitting on lone females.</p><p>But then there were his eyes. What if he had lost his memory?</p><p>And, besides, what were her alternatives? She could almost hear her sister Elizabeth\u2019s derisive laughter if Dougless called and asked for money. Elizabeth would certainly never consider taking a job from a man wearing armor. No doubt Elizabeth would know exactly what to do, and how to do it, in this situation, because Elizabeth was perfect. As were her other two sisters, Catherine and Anne. In fact, all the Montgomerys seemed to be perfect\u2014except for Dougless. She\u2019d often wondered if she\u2019d been put in the wrong crib in the hospital. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Dougless said abruptly. \u201cI might as well lose the rest of the day. I\u2019ll help you get some clothes and find a place to stay, but that\u2019s it. And I\u2019ll do it for, say . . . fifty dollars.\u201d That should be enough to get her a bed-and-breakfast for the night, she thought, and tomorrow she\u2019d screw up her courage and call Elizabeth again.</p><p>Swallowing his rising anger, Nicholas gave the woman a curt nod. He understood her meaning if not her words, but at least he had made her agree to stay with him for a few more hours. Later, he would have to find something else to keep her by his side until he discovered how to get back to his own time. And when he found what he needed to know, he would rejoice to leave this woman.</p><p>\u201cClothes,\u201d she was saying. \u201cWe\u2019ll get you clothes, then it\u2019ll be tea time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea? What is tea?\u201d</p> <p>Dougless stopped walking. An Englishman who pretended he didn\u2019t know about tea? This man was more than she could bear. She\u2019d help him until she got him checked into a hotel, then she\u2019d be glad to get rid of him.</p><p>FOUR</p><p>They walked together down the wide sidewalk in silence, the man looking in shop windows, at the people, and at the cars on the street. His handsome face wore such an expression of astonishment that Dougless could almost believe he had never seen the modern world before. He asked her no questions, but often halted for a moment to stare at a car or at a group of young girls in short skirts.</p><p>It was only a block to a small clothing store for men. \u201cHere\u2019s where we can buy you something less conspicuous to wear,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, I would see a tailor,\u201d he said, looking up over the door and frowning as though something were missing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a tailor, just ready-made clothes.\u201d</p><p>When they were inside the little shop, Nicholas stood still, gaping at the shirts and trousers hanging from the racks. \u201cThese clothes have been made,\u201d he said, his eyes wide.</p><p>Dougless started to reply, but instead turned to the clerk who\u2019d come forward to greet them. The man was small, thin, and had to be at least ninety years old. \u201cWe need clothing for him from the skin out. And he\u2019ll have to be measured for size.\u201d Even if the man did remember his sizes, he\u2019d no doubt pretend he didn\u2019t, she thought.</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d the clerk said, then looked at Nicholas. \u201cIf you\u2019ll step over here, sir, we can begin measuring.\u201d</p><p>When she saw that the man was leading the way to a semi-private area at the back of the store, Dougless stood where she was. But Nicholas insisted that she go with him into the curtained-off area.</p><p>Dougless sat on a chair off to one side, picked up a magazine, and pretended to read while the clerk began to undress Nicholas. The way he raised his arms for the clerk to unlatch his armor made it look as though he was used to other people undressing him. Carefully, almost reverently, the little man set Nicholas\u2019s armor on a cushioned bench. Dougless saw the man run a caressing hand down one side of the armor before turning back.</p> <p>Under the armor, Nicholas wore a big-armed linen shirt that was plastered to his body with sweat.</p><p>And what a body he had! Dougless thought as she almost dropped her magazine. She\u2019d seen armor in museums and had laughed at the way the metal had been molded into the shape of a muscular torso. She\u2019d always thought that it had been done to hide a man\u2019s paunch. But this man, this Nicholas Stafford, was indeed as broad-shouldered and as muscled as the shape of the armor.</p><p>Dougless tried her best to keep her attention on the magazine she was holding, some treatise on the joys of salmon fishing, but she kept glancing up at the bare-chested Nicholas. The clerk brought one shirt after another for him to try on, but the earl liked none of them. After about the fifteenth shirt, the clerk looked with pleading eyes to Dougless.</p><p>She put down the magazine and walked to stand before him, her eyes determinedly on his face. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked Nicholas.</p><p>He moved to one side, away from the clerk, who busied himself with folding clothes. \u201cThere is no beauty in this raiment,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cThere is no color, no jewels, no needlework. Perhaps a woman could ply her needle to one of these and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dougless smiled. \u201cWomen don\u2019t sew today. At least not like this,\u201d she said as she touched the cuff of his linen shirt that had been thrown across a clothing rack. The cuff was embroidered in black silk in a design of birds and flowers with a lovely hand-done trim of black cutwork on the edge.</p><p>Dougless caught herself. Of course women\u2014some women, somewhere\u2014still sewed like that because someone in this century had sewn that shirt, hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>Dougless picked up a beautiful cotton shirt from the discarded heap. The English weren\u2019t like Americans in always wanting something new every five minutes, so the clothing in English stores tended to be of the best quality, made to last for years. If one could afford the outrageous prices, the quality was worth the cost.</p> <p>\u201cHere, try this one on again,\u201d she said, finding herself coaxing him. She wondered if there was a woman alive who hadn\u2019t experienced shopping with a man and trying to persuade him to like something. \u201cLook at this fabric; feel how soft it is.\u201d</p><p>As Dougless held the shirt for him, his reluctance evident, Nicholas slipped his arms into the sleeves, while she did her best to keep her eyes off the way his muscles played under his skin.</p><p>The shirt was beautiful. \u201cNow,\u201d she said, \u201cstep over to the mirror and have a look.\u201d</p><p>She had seen the three full-length mirrors when they\u2019d entered the curtained area, so it had not occurred to her that Nicholas had not noticed them. She wasn\u2019t prepared for his reaction to the three mirrors. At first he just stared at them; then, cautiously, he reached out to touch one.</p><p>\u201cThey are glass?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cOf course. What else are mirrors made of?\u201d</p><p>From inside his balloon shorts, he withdrew a little round wooden object and handed it to her. On the other side of the wood was a metal mirror, and when Dougless looked into it, her image was distorted.</p><p>Glancing up at the man, she saw the way he was studying his reflection. Was it truly the first time he\u2019d ever seen a clear full-length view of himself? Had he only seen his own reflection in distorted metal mirrors such as the one she was holding?</p><p>Of course not, she told herself. He just didn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d seen a mirror. Or maybe he did remember and was pretending he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Looking up, she caught sight of her own reflection in the mirror. What a mess she was! As a result of all her crying, her eye makeup was under her eyes instead of above them. Her blouse was hanging out of her belt, and there a long cut on the sleeve, and it was dotted with blood. Her navy blue tights were bagging at the ankle. And her hair, tangled and droopy, was too awful to contemplate.</p><p>Turning away from the unpleasant vision, she mumbled, \u201cTrousers.\u201d This time, Dougless left the curtained area as the clerk measured Nicholas. When the door to the shop opened and more customers entered, the clerk ushered Nicholas to a dressing room, then handed him several pair of trousers through the door. All was quiet for a moment until Dougless saw the dressing room door open a crack and the man peeped out, looking at Dougless for help. She went to him.</p><p>\u201cI cannot manage,\u201d he said softly, then opened the door wider so she could enter. \u201cWhat manner of fastening is this?\u201d</p><p>Dougless tried not to think of this situation. She was squashed into a dressing room with a strange man who couldn\u2019t figure out how to work the zipper on the front of his trousers. \u201cHere, like . . .\u201d She started to show him on the trousers he had on, but she thought better of that. Taking a pair hanging from a hook, she showed him the zipper, then the snaps; then she took a step back to watch while, childlike, he zipped and unzipped, snapped and unsnapped. When she was sure he\u2019d caught on, she started to open the door.</p><p>\u201cWait. What is this wondrous substance?\u201d He held up a pair of boxer shorts, stretching the waistband in and out.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s elastic,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cElastic,\u201d he said, mispronouncing the word as \u201celistic.\u201d But his face was so alight with discovery that she couldn\u2019t help feeling good also.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWait until you see velcro.\u201d She backed out of the dressing room. \u201cYou need any more help, let me know.\u201d</p><p>She was still smiling as she closed the door behind her. Standing with her back to the dressing room door, she looked at the clothes around her. How plain they must look to a man who was used to wearing silver armor, she thought.</p><p>While they had been inside the dressing room, the clerk had placed the armor, the sword, and the dagger in two large, doubled shopping bags and had set them to the left of the dressing room door. When Dougless went to pick up the bags, they were so heavy she almost dropped them.</p><p>After a while, Nicholas came out of the dressing room. He was wearing a soft white cotton shirt and slim gray cotton trousers. The shirt was of the current voluminous style, while the trousers were snug. He looked utterly divine.</p><p>As Dougless watched him, he walked to the mirror, then glowered at his image.</p><p>\u201cThese . . . these,\u201d he said, tugging at the ease of the trousers at the back of his leg.</p><p>\u201cTrousers. Pants,\u201d she supplied, blinking at him. It was taking her a while to adjust to his good looks.</p><p>\u201cThey do not fit me. They do not show my legs, and I have a fine pair of legs.\u201d</p><p>Dougless laughed and her trance was broken. \u201cMen don\u2019t wear stockings now, but, really, you look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not sure,\u201d he said, frowning. \u201cPerhaps a chain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo chain,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cTrust me on this. No chain.\u201d</p><p>She chose a leather belt for him, then socks. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to go to another store for shoes.\u201d</p><p>Feeling as though she\u2019d done her good deed for the year, Dougless wasn\u2019t prepared for Nicholas\u2019s actions at the cash register. The little clerk totaled the tags he\u2019d cut from the clothes, then told them the cost. Dougless was shocked speechless when Nicholas shouted, \u201cI will have your head, thief!\u201d then reached for his sword\u2014which, thankfully, was in the shopping bags by Dougless\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cHe means to rob me!\u201d Nicholas bellowed. \u201cI can hire a dozen men for less than he asks for these unadorned clothes.\u201d</p><p>Dougless nearly leaped as she put herself between Nicholas and the counter while the poor little clerk huddled against the opposite wall. \u201cGive me the money,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cEverything costs more now than it used to. I mean,\u201d she said as she clenched her teeth, \u201cyou\u2019ll remember soon enough about how much things cost. Now, give me the money.\u201d</p><p>Still angry, he handed Dougless the leather bag full of coins. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cthe modern money.\u201d When Nicholas just stood there, not seeming to understand what she was talking about, she searched through the shopping bags until she found the English pounds.</p><p>\u201cHe will take paper for clothes?\u201d the earl whispered as Dougless counted out the money; then he smiled. \u201cI will give him all the paper he wants. He is a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s paper money,\u201d she said as they left the shop. \u201cAnd you can exchange the paper for gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone will give me gold for paper?\u201d he asked, incredulous.</p><p>\u201cYes, there are gold dealers, and some banks sell gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you not use gold to buy goods with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo heavy, I guess.\u201d She sighed. \u201cYou put your money in a bank. Money you aren\u2019t using, that is, and use the paper as a substitute for the gold. Where do you put your money?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIn my houses,\u201d he answered, frowning as he considered what she\u2019d told him.</p><p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI guess you dig a hole and hide it. Well, today money is put in a bank where it earns interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is interest?\u201d</p><p>Dougless groaned. Enough was enough! \u201cHere\u2019s a tea shop. Are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered as he opened the door for her.</p><p>The English custom of afternoon tea was a tradition Dougless had taken to readily. It was heaven to sit down at four o\u2019clock and sip delicious hot tea and eat a scone. Or five scones, as Gloria did, she thought with a grimace.</p><p>At the thought of Gloria, her fists clenched. Did Robert know his daughter had taken Dougless\u2019s handbag? Did he know he\u2019d left Dougless completely stranded, alone at the mercy of crazy men? And how had Gloria known that Dougless had been expecting an engagement ring? For the life of her, Dougless couldn\u2019t believe that Robert had told Gloria such a thing. Had Dougless said something and Gloria had guessed from that?</p><p>Dougless couldn\u2019t believe that Robert had done what Gloria said and \u201claughed\u201d about her. Robert wasn\u2019t a bad person. If he were, he wouldn\u2019t love his daughter so much. He wasn\u2019t one of those men who went off and left their children without a backward glance. No, Robert felt bad because he\u2019d left his child when he\u2019d divorced, and he desperately wanted to make it up to his daughter, so he took her with him when he went on vacation. And it was natural for Gloria to fight for her father\u2019s love, wasn\u2019t it? And wasn\u2019t it natural for the child to be jealous of the woman her father loved?</p><p>Dougless knew that if Robert walked into the tea shop at that moment, she would fall to her knees and beg his forgiveness.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d the woman behind the counter asked.</p><p>\u201cTea for two,\u201d Dougless said. \u201cAnd two scones, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have clotted cream and strawberries also,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>Absently, Dougless nodded, and in moments the woman passed a tray holding a pot of strong tea, cups, and plates of food across the counter to her. She paid, then picked up the tray and looked at Nicholas. \u201cShall we eat outside?\u201d</p><p>He followed her outside to a little garden that had vines growing over the old brick walls that enclosed it. Fat old-fashioned roses ran along the border and filled the area with their fragrance. Silently, Dougless set the tray down and began to pour the tea into two cups. On her previous trips to England, her mother had considered her too young to drink tea, but she\u2019d tried the English custom of adding milk to tea the first day of this trip and had found it delicious. The milk made the tea the correct temperature and took the sharp tannin flavor out of the tea.</p><p>Nicholas was walking about the little garden, studying the walls and the plants. She called him to the picnic table and handed him his cup of tea and a scone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gave the tea a tentative look, then sipped cautiously. After two sips, he looked at Dougless with such na**d joy on his face that she laughed as he drained the cup. She poured him another cup while he picked up the scone and looked at it. It was very much like a southern American biscuit, but it had sugar in the dough, and these were fruit scones, so they had raisins in them.</p><p>She took the scone from him, broke it in half and slathered it with the thick clotted cream. He bit into it and as he chewed he looked like a man who had fallen in love.</p><p>In minutes he had drunk all the tea and eaten all the scones. After a couple of remarks about his gluttony, Dougless went back into the shop and bought more of everything. When she returned, she ate while he leaned back in his chair, sipped tea, and studied her.</p><p>\u201cWhat made you to weep in the church?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI . . . I really don\u2019t believe that\u2019s any of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I am to return\u2014and I must return\u2014I need to know what brought me forth.\u201d</p><p>Dougless put her half-eaten scone down. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to start that again, are you? You know what I think? I think you\u2019re a graduate student in Elizabethan history, probably Ph.D. level, and you got carried away with your research. My father said it used to happen to him, that he\u2019d read so much medieval script that after a while he couldn\u2019t read modern handwriting.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas looked at her with distaste. \u201cFor all your wonders of horseless chariots, your marvelous glass, and the riches of goods to purchase, you have no faith in the mystery and magic of the world,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut I do not doubt what has happened to me, and I know from whence I came,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cAnd you, witch\u2014\u201d</p><p>At that, Dougless got up and left the table. But he caught her before she reached the door to the shop, his hand cutting into her arm.</p> <p>\u201cWhy were you weeping when first I saw you? What could cause a woman to weep such as I heard?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She jerked out of his grip. \u201cBecause I\u2019d just been left behind,\u201d she said angrily. Then, to her shame, tears began again.</p><p>Gently, he slipped her arm in his and led her back to the table. This time, he sat beside her, poured her another cup of tea, added milk, and handed her the pretty porcelain cup.</p><p>\u201cNow, madam, you must tell me what plagues you so that tears pour forth from your eyes as from a waterfall.\u201d</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t want to tell anyone what had happened to her. But her need to share was greater than her pride, and within minutes, she was pouring out her story to him.</p><p>\u201cThis man left you alone? Unattended?\u201d Nicholas asked, aghast. \u201cHe left you at the mercy of ruffians and thieves?\u201d</p> <p>Nodding, Dougless blew her nose on a paper napkin. \u201cAnd at the mercy of men who believe they\u2019re from the sixteenth century, too. Oh, sorry,\u201d she added.</p><p>But Nicholas didn\u2019t seem to hear her. He got up and began pacing the garden. There were four other tables but no other customers. \u201cYou but knelt by the tomb\u2014my tomb\u2014and asked for a . . .\u201d He looked at her.</p><p>\u201cA Knight in Shining Armor. It\u2019s an American saying. All women want a gorgeous . . . I mean, a . . . Well, a man to rescue her.\u201d</p><p>Smiling a bit, his lips hidden in his beard and mustache, he said, \u201cI was not wearing armor when you called me forth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t call you,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cIt\u2019s customary to cry when you get left in a church. Especially when a fat brat of a girl steals your handbag. I don\u2019t even have a passport. Even if my family wired me money for a ticket home, I couldn\u2019t leave immediately. I\u2019d have to apply for another passport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor can I get home,\u201d he said, beginning to pace again. \u201cThat we have in common. But if you brought me forth, you can send me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a witch,\u201d she practically shouted at him. \u201cI do not practice black magic, and I certainly don\u2019t know how to send people back and forth in time. You\u2019ve imagined all of this.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at her. \u201cNo doubt your lover was justified in leaving you. With your vile temper, he would not want to remain with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was never \u2018vile-tempered\u2019 as you call it, with Robert. Maybe a little-short-tempered now and then, but only normally so, because I loved him. Love him. And I shouldn\u2019t have complained so much about Gloria. It was just that her lying was beginning to get on my nerves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you love this man who abandoned you, this man who allowed his daughter to steal from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt if Robert knows Gloria took my bag and, besides, Gloria is just a kid. She probably doesn\u2019t even realize what she did. I just wish I could find them and get my passport back so I could go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems we have kindred goals,\u201d he said, his eyes boring into hers.</p><p>Suddenly, she knew where he was leading. He wanted her to help him on a permanent basis. But she was not going to saddle herself with a man with amnesia.</p><p>She set her empty cup down. \u201cOur goals aren\u2019t alike enough that we should spend the next few months together until you remember that you live in New Jersey with your wife and three kids, and that every summer you come to England, put on fancy armor, and play some little sex game with an unsuspecting tourist. No, thank you. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, I believe we have an agreement. I\u2019ll find you a hotel room, then I\u2019m free to leave.\u201d</p><p>When she finished speaking, she could see the flush of anger through his beard. \u201cAre all the women of this century as you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just the ones who have been hurt over and over again,\u201d she shot back at him. \u201cIf you really have lost your memory, you should go to a doctor, not pick up a woman in a church. And if this is all an act, then you should definitely go to a doctor. Either way, you don\u2019t need me.\u201d She put the tea things on the tray to carry them back into the shop, but he stood between her and the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat recourse have I if I tell the truth? Have you no belief that your tears could have called me from another time, another place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I don\u2019t believe that,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a thousand explanations as to why you think you\u2019re from the sixteenth century, but not one of them has to do with my being a witch. Now, will you excuse me? I need to put these down so I can find you a hotel room.\u201d</p><p>He stepped aside so she could enter the tea room, then followed her to the street. All the while, he kept his head down as though he were considering some great problem.</p><p>Dougless had asked the woman in the tea shop where the nearest bed-and-breakfast was, and as she and Nicholas walked quietly along the street, it bothered her that he didn\u2019t speak. Nor did he look about him with the intense interest he\u2019d shown earlier.</p><p>\u201cDo you like your clothes?\u201d she asked, trying to make conversation. He was carrying the shopping bags full of armor and his old clothes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, but kept walking, his brow furrowed.</p><p>There was only one room available at the bed-and-breakfast, and Dougless started to sign the register. \u201cDo you still insist that you\u2019re Nicholas Stafford?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>The woman behind the little desk smiled. \u201cOh, like in the church.\u201d She took a postcard of the tomb in the church from a rack and looked at it. \u201cYou do look like him, only a bit more alive,\u201d she said, then laughed at her own joke. \u201cFirst door on the right. Bath\u2019s down the hall.\u201d Smiling, she left them alone in the entrance hall.</p><p>When Dougless turned to look at the man, she suddenly felt as though she were a mother abandoning her child. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember soon,\u201d she said soothingly. \u201cAnd this lady can tell you where to get dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd dinner at this hour?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, frustrated. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman and a meal this late is supper. I\u2019ll bet that after a good night\u2019s sleep you\u2019ll remember everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have forgot naught, madam,\u201d he said stiffly, then seemed to relent. \u201cAnd you cannot leave. Only you know how to return me to my own time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut me some slack, will you?\u201d she snapped at him. Didn\u2019t he understand that she, too, had needs? She couldn\u2019t give up all that she needed to help this stranger, could she? \u201cIf you\u2019ll just give me the fifty dollars we agreed on, I\u2019ll leave. In pounds, that\u2019s . . .\u201d To her horror, she realized that was only about thirty pounds. A room in this bed-and-breakfast had cost forty pounds. But a deal was a deal. \u201cIf you\u2019ll give me thirty pounds, I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201d</p><p>When he just stood there, she rummaged in the shopping bags until she found his paper money; then she removed thirty pounds and gave him the rest of it. \u201cTomorrow you can take your coins to the dealer and he\u2019ll give you more modern money,\u201d she said as she turned to go. \u201cGood luck.\u201d She gave one last look to his blue eyes that looked so sorrowful, then turned and left.</p><p>But once she left the house, she didn\u2019t feel jubilant at finally having rid herself of the man. Instead, she felt as though she were missing something. But Dougless forced herself to put her shoulders back and her head up. It was getting late and she had to find a place to spend the night\u2014a cheap place\u2014and she had to decide where to go from here.</p><p>FIVE</p><p>When Nicholas found the upstairs room where he was to spend the night, he was appalled. The room was small, with two tiny, hard-looking beds with no cloth hangings enclosing them, and the walls were very bare. But upon closer examination he saw that the walls were painted with thousands of tiny blue flowers. On second thought, he decided that with a few borders and some order to the paintings they might look all right.</p><p>There was a window with that marvelous glass in it, and it had fabric side hangings of painted cloth. There were framed pictures on the walls, and when he touched one, he felt the glass\u2014so clear he could hardly see it. One of the pictures was quite lewd, showing two na**d women sitting on a cloth near two fully dressed men. It was not that Nicholas didn\u2019t like the picture, but he couldn\u2019t bear to see such a shameful thing displayed so openly. He turned it to face the wall.</p><p>There was a door that led to a press, but there were no shelves in it. There was only a round stick going from one side to the other, with the same steel shapes that he had seen in the clothes shop hanging from the stick. There was a cabinet in the room, but such as he\u2019d never seen before. It was entirely full of drawers! He tried, but the top of the cabinet did not lift up. He pulled the drawers out one by one and they worked marvelously well.</p><p>After a while, Nicholas began to look for a chamber pot, but one was not to be found anywhere in the room. Finally, he went downstairs and out to the back garden to find a privy, but there was none.</p><p>\u201cHave things changed that much in four hundred years?\u201d he mumbled as he relieved himself in the rosebushes. He fumbled with the zipper and snaps, but managed rather well, he thought.</p><p>\u201cI will do well without the witch,\u201d he said to himself as he went back into the house. Perhaps tomorrow he would wake and find this all to be a dream, a long, bad dream.</p><p>No one was about downstairs, so Nicholas looked into a room with an open door. There was furniture in the room that was fully covered with fine, woven fabric. There was a chair with not one inch of wood showing. When he sat on the chair, the softness enveloped him. For a moment he closed his eyes and thought of his mother and her old, frail bones. How she\u2019d like a chair like this, covered in softness and fabric, he thought.</p><p>Against one wall was a tall wooden desk with a stool beneath it. Here was something that looked somewhat familiar. When he examined the cabinet, he saw the hinge and lifted the top. It was not a desk but a type of harpsichord, and when he touched the keys, the sound was different. There was written music in front of him and for once something looked familiar.</p><p>Nicholas sat down on the stool, ran his fingers over the keys to hear the tone of them, then, awkwardly at first, began to play the music before him.</p><p>\u201cThat was beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Turning, he saw the landlady standing behind him.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Moon River\u2019 always was one of my favorites. How do you do with ragtime?\u201d She searched inside a drawer in a little table that had an extraordinary plant on top of it and withdrew another piece of music. \u201cThey\u2019re all American tunes,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband was an American.\u201d</p><p>The most extraordinary piece of music, called \u201cThe Sting,\u201d was put before Nicholas. It took him some time before he played it to the woman\u2019s satisfaction, but once he understood the rhythm of the music, he played it with enjoyment.</p><p>\u201cOh, my, you are good,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could get a job in any pub.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, a public house. I will consider the possibility,\u201d Nicholas said, smiling as he stood up. \u201cThe need of employment might yet arise.\u201d Suddenly, he felt dizzy and reached out to catch himself on a chair.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerely tired,\u201d Nicholas murmured.</p><p>\u201cTraveling always wears me out. Been far today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHundreds of years.\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled. \u201cI feel that way too when I travel. You should go up to your room and have a bit of a lie-down before supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nicholas said softly as he started for the stairs. Perhaps tomorrow he would be able to think more clearly about how to get himself back to his own time. Or perhaps tomorrow he\u2019d wake up in his own bed and find that all of it was over, not just this twentieth-century nightmare, but also the nightmare he\u2019d been in when last he was home.</p><p>In his room he undressed slowly, and hung his clothes up as he had seen done in the clothes shop. Where was the witch now? he wondered. Was she back in the arms of her lover? She was powerful enough to have called him forward over four hundred years, so he had no doubt that she could conjure an errant lover back across mere miles.</p><p>Nude, Nicholas climbed into bed. The sheets were smooth beyond believing and they smelled clean and fresh. Over him, instead of multiple, heavy coverlets, was a fat, soft, light blanket.</p><p>Tomorrow, he thought as he closed his eyes in weariness. Tomorrow he would be home.</p><p>Instantly, he fell into a sleep that was deeper than any he\u2019d ever experienced before, and he heard nothing when the sky opened and it began to rain.</p><p>Hours after he went to bed, reluctantly, he was awakened by his own thrashing about. Groggily, Nicholas sat up. The room was so dark that at first he didn\u2019t know where he was. As he listened to the rain pounding on the roof, his memory gradually returned. He fumbled at the table beside the bed for flint and candle so he could make a light, but there were none. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat manner of place is this?\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cThere are no chamber pots, no privies, and no lights.\u201d</p><p>As he was grumbling, his head turned sharply as he listened. Someone was calling him. The voice was not in words. He couldn\u2019t hear the actual sound of his name, but he could feel the urgency and the desperate need of a voice that was reaching out to him.</p><p>No doubt it was the witch-woman, he thought with a grimace. Was she bent over a cauldron of snakes\u2019 eyes, stirring and cackling and whispering his name?</p><p>As Nicholas felt the pull of the call, he knew there was no use fighting her. As he lived and breathed, he knew he had to go to her.</p> <p>With great reluctance, he left the warm bed, then began the arduous task of trying to dress himself in the strange modern clothes. It was when he pulled up the zipper that he discovered the parts of his body that were most susceptible to being caught in the tiny metal teeth. Cursing, he put on the flimsy shirt and felt his way out of the dark room.</p><p>He was glad to see that there was light in the hall. On the wall was a glass-enclosed torch, but the flame was not fire, and whatever it was, it was encased in a round glass sphere. He wanted to examine this miracle further, but through a window came a flash of lightning, and a crack of thunder rattled the house\u2014and the call came to him more forcefully.</p><p>He went down the stairs, across lush carpets, and out into the pouring rain. Shielding his face with his hands, Nicholas looked up to see that high above his head were more flames set on top of poles, yet the blowing rain did not extinguish their fire. Shivering, already wet through, Nicholas put his head down into his collar. These modern clothes had no substance! The modern people must be strong! he thought. How did they survive with no capes, or jerkins to protect them from the driving rain?</p><p>Struggling against the force of the rain, he went down streets that were unfamiliar to him. Several times he heard strange noises and reached for his sword, then cursed when he found that the weapon was not there. Tomorrow, he thought, he would sell more coins and hire guards to accompany him. And tomorrow he would force the woman to tell him the truth of what she had done to bring him to this strange land.</p><p>He struggled down street after street, making several wrong turns, but then he\u2019d stop and listen until the call came again. After a while of following what he was hearing inside his mind, he left the streets that had the torches on poles and entered the darkness of the countryside. For several minutes, he walked along a road, then stopped and listened as he wiped rain from his face. Finally, he turned right and started across a field, and when he reached a fence, he climbed over it, then kept walking. At long last, he reached a small shed, and he knew that, at last, he had found her.</p> <p>As he flung open the door, a flash of lightning showed her inside the shed. She was drenched and shivering, and curled into a ball on some dirty straw, trying her best to get warm. And, once again, she was weeping.</p><p>\u201cWell, madam,\u201d he said, his teeth clenched in anger, \u201cyou have called me from a warm bed. What is it you want of me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cLeave me alone.\u201d</p><p>As he looked down at her, he had to admire her fortitude\u2014as well as her pride. Her teeth were chattering so hard he could hear them over the rain; she was obviously freezing. With a sigh, he released his anger. If she were such a powerful witch, why had she not conjured herself a dry place for the night? Nicholas stepped into the leaking shed, bent, and lifted her into his arms. \u201cI do not know who is the more helpless,\u201d he said, \u201cyou or I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d she said, as he picked her up, but she made no real struggle to get away from him. Instead, she put her head against his shoulder and began to sob harder. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find any place to stay. Everything in England costs so much and I don\u2019t know where Robert is and I\u2019ll have to call Elizabeth and she\u2019ll laugh at me,\u201d she said all in one almost unintelligible sentence.</p><p>Nicholas had to adjust her in his arms as he swung over the fence, but he kept walking, and Dougless continued crying as her arms slipped around his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t belong anywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cMy family is perfect, but I\u2019m not. All the women in my family marry wonderful men, but I can\u2019t even meet any wonderful men. Robert was a great catch but I couldn\u2019t hold on to him. Oh, Nick, what am I going to do?\u201d</p> <p>They were out of the fields and back onto a paved road. \u201cFirst, madam,\u201d he said, \u201cyou may not call me Nick. Nicholas, yes, Colin, perhaps, but not Nick. Now, since we seem destined to know one another, what is your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDougless,\u201d she said, clinging to him. \u201cIt\u2019s Dougless Montgomery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, a good, sensible name.\u201d</p><p>Dougless sniffed, her tears slowing down. \u201cMy father teaches medieval history so he named me after Dougless Sheffield. You know, the woman who bore the earl of Leicester\u2019s illegitimate child.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas halted. \u201cShe what?\u201d</p><p>Dougless pulled away to look up at him in surprise. The rain was now just a soft drizzle and there was enough moonlight so she could see his expression. \u201cShe bore the earl of Leicester\u2019s child,\u201d she said in surprise.</p><p>Immediately, Nicholas set her on the ground and glared at her. The rain was dripping off both their faces. \u201cAnd, pray tell, who is the earl of Leicester?\u201d</p><p>His disguise is slipping, Dougless thought as she smiled up at him. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you pretend to know this?\u201d When Nicholas didn\u2019t answer, Dougless said, \u201cThe earl of Leicester was Robert Dudley, the man who loved Queen Elizabeth so much.\u201d</p> <p>At that, rage filled Nicholas\u2019s face; then he turned and stomped away. \u201cThe Dudleys are traitors, executed every one of them,\u201d he said over his shoulder. \u201cAnd Queen Elizabeth is to marry the king of Spain. She will not marry a Dudley, I can assure you of that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, she won\u2019t marry a Dudley, but she won\u2019t marry the king of Spain, either,\u201d Dougless shouted as she ran after him. But she let out a yelp of pain when she twisted her ankle and fell onto the asphalt, scraping her hands and knees.</p><p>Angrily, Nicholas turned back to her. \u201cWoman, you are a bloody great trouble,\u201d he said as he again lifted her into his arms.</p><p>Dougless started to speak, but when he told her to be quiet, she put her head back against his shoulder and said nothing.</p><p>He carried her all the way back to the B and B where he was staying, and when he pushed open the door, he found the landlady sitting on a chair and waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d the landlady said, relief in her voice. \u201cI heard you leave, and I knew in my heart that something was wrong. Oh, you poor dears, you both look done in. Why don\u2019t you take her upstairs and while she\u2019s having a nice, hot soak I\u2019ll make you both some tea and sandwiches.\u201d She looked at Nicholas. \u201cI took your dinner up earlier, but you didn\u2019t answer my knock. You must have been asleep.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas nodded at the woman, then followed her up the stairs, still carrying Dougless, but also managing to ignore her. The landlady led them to a room Nicholas had not seen before. It had strange, large pottery vessels in it, one of which he recognized as a bathtub. But he saw no buckets of water, and he\u2019d seen no maids about. Who filled this large tub?</p><p>He nearly dropped the woman he was holding when the landlady turned a knob above the tub and out poured water. A fountain inside the house! Nicholas thought, his eyes wide in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be hot in a minute,\u201d the landlady said. \u201cYou should get her undressed and put her in the tub while I get fresh towels. And you look like you could use a soak too,\u201d she said as she left the room.</p><p>Nicholas had understood enough of what the landlady said to consider the idea. He looked down at Dougless with interest.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Dougless warned. \u201cYou\u2019re to leave this room while I take a bath.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he set her down and looked about. \u201cWhat manner of room is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see the bathing pot, but what is this object? And this?\u201d</p><p>Dougless stood there in her cold, wet clothes, and looked at him. She\u2019d thought he\u2019d made a major slip up in his disguise when he\u2019d pretended to know so little about Robert Dudley, but as he\u2019d said more, Dougless knew he\u2019d been right. She\u2019d have to call her father for the dates, but she knew without asking that in 1564, the year this man said he\u2019d last been in, Robert Dudley had not yet been made the earl of Leicester.</p><p>So now this man was standing there in wet clothes that clung to his beautiful body, and he was asking her what a toilet and sink were. She had to restrain herself from asking what he\u2019d been using if he didn\u2019t know what a toilet was. But of course he knew, she told herself. However, he must have been studying very, very hard to have forgotten something so basic. She demonstrated the basin; then, with a face red with embarrassment, she explained the toilet. She demonstrated seat up and seat down. \u201cAnd you never, never leave the seat up,\u201d she said, feeling as though she were doing her part for womankind in teaching one man this simple thing.</p><p>They were interrupted when the landlady returned with more towels and a flowered cotton robe. \u201cI noticed you didn\u2019t have much luggage,\u201d she said, her tone hinting that she wanted to know why. \u201cUsually, Americans show up with so much luggage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe airlines lost it all,\u201d Dougless said quickly, and wondered if she thought Nicholas was also American. Was his accent odd to an English person?</p><p>\u201cI thought it was something like that,\u201d the landlady said. \u201cI\u2019ll get your tea and leave it on the table in the hall, if that\u2019s all right with you. So, good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, thank you,\u201d Dougless said as the door closed, leaving her alone with Nicholas, whom she dismissed quickly. \u201cYou can go now. I won\u2019t be long.\u201d Smiling as though he was enjoying Dougless\u2019s nervousness, he left the bathroom. When she was alone, Dougless slipped into the hot water, lay back, and closed her eyes. The water stung her scraped knees and elbows, but already the hot water was beginning to warm her.</p><p>How had he found her? she wondered. After she\u2019d left him at the B and B, she\u2019d wandered all over the village trying to find a place to stay for thirty pounds, but there was nothing. All the less expensive places were full. She\u2019d spent six pounds on a meal in a pub, then started walking. She thought perhaps she could make it to another village before night and find shelter there. But the rain had started, it\u2019d grown dark, and all Dougless could find was a leaky shed set in the middle of a field. At first she\u2019d curled up on some dirty straw and gone to sleep, but she awoke sometime during the night to find herself crying\u2014but then, crying seemed to be her normal state over the last twenty-four hours.</p><p>While she\u2019d been crying, he had appeared\u2014and, the truth was, she hadn\u2019t been surprised to see him. In fact, it had seemed perfectly natural that he\u2019d known where to find her and that he\u2019d come out into the rain for her. It had also seemed natural when he\u2019d picked her up in his strong arms.</p><p>When the water grew cold, Dougless got out of the tub, dried herself-off, then put on the flowered robe. A glance in the mirror showed her to have on no makeup and her hair . . . The less thought about that the better. There was nothing she could do about her appearance as she didn\u2019t have so much as a comb.</p><p>Shyly, she knocked on the half-open bedroom door. Nicholas, wearing only his still-wet trousers, flung it open. \u201cThe bathroom is yours,\u201d she said, trying to smile and trying to act as though the situation was normal.</p><p>But now there was no softness in his face. \u201cGet into that bed and stay there,\u201d he ordered. \u201cI do not intend to go bat-fowling again.\u201d</p><p>She only nodded at him as he passed her on the way to the bathroom. On the table was a tray of food and a pot of tea. \u201cBet he didn\u2019t leave me any,\u201d she muttered at the same time she was thinking that she didn\u2019t deserve any more kindness from him. She had been a pest to him. But he\u2019d left enough in the pot for her to have a cup of tea and he\u2019d left a chicken sandwich for her. Gratefully, Dougless ate and drank it all; then, wearing the thin robe, she slipped under the comforter of the second bed. When he returned, they would talk, she thought. She would ask him how he found out where she was. How had he found her in the dark in the pouring rain?</p><p>She meant to talk to him when he returned, but she closed her eyes for a moment, and the next thing she knew it was morning. Warm sunlight was hitting her full in the face, and slowly, groggily, she opened her eyes.</p><p>There was a man standing before the window, his back to her, and he was wearing only a small white towel fastened about his hips. As though in a dream, Dougless noticed that he had a muscular back that tapered down to a small slim waist, and his legs were heavy with muscle.</p><p>Slowly, Dougless came awake enough to remember who this man was. She remembered everything, their first meeting in the church when he\u2019d drawn a sword on her, to last night when he\u2019d found her and carried her through the rain.</p><p>When she sat up, he turned to look at her.</p><p>\u201cYou are awake,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cCome, get up, as there is much we must do.\u201d</p><p>As she got out of bed, she saw that he, too, meant to get dressed . . . in front of her. Grabbing her own wrinkled clothing, she went to the bathroom to dress. When she had her clothes on, she looked into the mirror and nearly started crying again. She looked awful! Her eyes were still red, and her hair was a tangled, frizzy mess\u2014and she knew she had no way to repair the damage. As she looked into the mirror, she thought that if all women had to confront the world with the face God gave them, there would be a great increase in female suicides.</p><p>Putting her shoulders back, she left the bathroom, where she almost ran into Nicholas, as he was waiting for her in the hall.</p><p>\u201cFirst we eat; then, madam, we talk,\u201d he said as though his words were a dare.</p><p>Dougless merely nodded as she went ahead of him down the stairs to the little dining room.</p><p>Dougless smiled when they entered the room, and she remembered something she\u2019d read in a guidebook. It had stated that there are two meals that should be eaten in England: breakfast and tea. When she and Nicholas were seated at a small table, the landlady began bringing in platters full of food. There were fluffy scrambled eggs, three types of bread, bacon that was like the best American ham, grilled tomatoes, fried potatoes, golden kippers, cream, butter, and marmalade. And in the middle of the table was a large, pretty porcelain pot of brewed tea that the landlady kept filled throughout the meal.</p><p>Ravenous, Dougless ate until she could hold no more, but she couldn\u2019t come close to competing with Nicholas. He ate nearly all the food that was set on the table. When Dougless finished eating, she caught the landlady watching Nicholas curiously. He ate everything with his spoon or his fingers. He used his knife to cut the bacon while holding it in place with his fingers, but he never once touched his fork. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When he had finally finished eating, he thanked the landlady, then took Dougless\u2019s arm in his and ushered her outside.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked as she ran her tongue over her teeth. She hadn\u2019t brushed them in twenty-four hours, and they felt fuzzy. Also, her scalp itched.</p><p>\u201cTo the church,\u201d he said. \u201cThere we will conceive of a plan.\u201d</p><p>They walked quickly to the church, with Nicholas stopping only once to gawk at a small pickup truck. Dougless started to tell him about eighteen-wheelers and cattle trucks, but thought better of participating in his game.</p> <p>The old church was open and empty, and Nicholas led her to sit on a pew that was at a right angle to the tomb. In silence, she watched him as he looked at the marble sculpture for a while, then ran his hands over the date and name.</p><p>At last he turned away, clasped his hands behind his back, and began to pace. \u201cAs I see it, Mistress Montgomery,\u201d he said, \u201cwe need each the other. It is my belief that God has put us together for a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I did it with a spell,\u201d she said, meaning it as a joke, but, actually, she was glad that he at last seemed to realize that she was not a witch.</p><p>\u201cIt is true that I believed that at first, but I have not slept since you called me into the rain and I have now had time to consider more thoroughly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called you?\u201d she said in disbelief. \u201cI never even thought about you, much less called you. And I can assure you that there weren\u2019t any telephones in that field, and I certainly couldn\u2019t shout loud enough for you to hear me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNonetheless, you did call me. You woke me with your need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d she said, starting to get angry. \u201cWe\u2019re going back to your belief that I somehow, through some sort of hocus-pocus, brought you here from your grave. I can\u2019t take this anymore. I\u2019m leaving,\u201d she said as she started to stand up.</p><p>But before she could move, he was in front of her, one hand on the high arm of the pew, the other on the back, his big body pinning her to her seat. \u201cIt matters not to me whether you believe or not,\u201d he said, his face near hers, his eyebrows drawn together. \u201cYesterday morn when I woke it was the year of our Lord 1564, and this morn it was . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNineteen eighty-eight,\u201d she whispered up at him.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, \u201cover four hundred years later. And you, witch, are the key to my being here and to my returning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019d send you back if I could,\u201d she said, her mouth a hard line. \u201cI have enough problems of my own without having to take care of\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He leaned so close to her face that his nose nearly touched hers, and she could feel the heat of his anger. \u201cYou could not dare to say that you must care for me. It is I who must pull you from fields in the dead of night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was just the one time only,\u201d Dougless said weakly, then sat back against the pew. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said with a sigh, \u201chow did you hear my . . . need, as you call it?\u201d</p><p>He dropped his arms from the pew, then went back to look down at the tomb. \u201cThere is a bond between us,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cMayhap it is an unholy bond, but it is there. I was awakened during the night with your calling of me. I did not hear words, but nonetheless, I heard you calling me. The . . . feel of the call woke me, so I followed it to find you.\u201d</p><p>Dougless was silent for a moment. She knew that what he said had to be true because there was no other explanation for how he\u2019d found her. \u201cAre you saying that you think there\u2019s some kind of mental telepathy between us?\u201d</p><p>Turning back to her, he gave her a puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cMental telepathy is thought transference. People can read each other\u2019s thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he said, looking back at the tomb. \u201cI am not sure it is thoughts as much as it is . . .\u201d He trailed off for a moment. \u201cNeed. I seem to hear your need of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone,\u201d Dougless said stubbornly.</p> <p>Turning back, he glared at her. \u201cI do not understand why you are not still in your father\u2019s house. I have yet to see a woman who needs care more than you.\u201d</p><p>Again, Dougless started to stand up, but a look from Nicholas made her sit back down. \u201cAll right, you heard me \u2018call,\u2019 as you say. So what do you think that means?\u201d</p><p>Again, Nicholas put his hands behind his back and began to pace. \u201cI have come to this time and this fast, strange place for a reason, and I believe you are to help me find the answer as to why I am here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Dougless said quickly. \u201cI have to find Robert and get my passport so I can go home. The truth is that I\u2019ve had all the vacation I can stand. Another twenty-four hours like the last ones, and somebody better start carving my tombstone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life and death are a jest to you, but they are not so to me,\u201d Nicholas said quietly.</p><p>Dougless lifted her hands in frustration. \u201cYou want me to feel sorry for you because you\u2019re dead? But you aren\u2019t dead. You\u2019re here; you\u2019re alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, madam, there am I,\u201d he said, pointing at the tomb.</p><p>For a moment, Dougless put her head back against the pew and closed her eyes. Right now, she should leave. Actually, she should probably ask someone for help. But the truth was, she couldn\u2019t do either of those things. Whatever this man\u2019s real story was, even if she didn\u2019t believe he was from another time period, he certainly seemed to believe it. And after he\u2019d rescued her last night, she owed him. She looked at him. \u201cWhat do you plan?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI will help you find your lover, but in return, you must help me find the reason I am here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you help me find Robert?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI can feed, clothe, and shelter you until he is found,\u201d he shot back instantly.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. Those things. How about eyeshadow too? Okay, only kidding. So, supposing \u2018we\u2019 do find Robert, what do you want me to do to help you find your, ah, way back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night you talked to me of Robert Dudley and Queen Elizabeth. You seemed to know who our young queen will marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElizabeth doesn\u2019t marry anyone, and she becomes known as the Virgin Queen. In America there\u2019re a couple of states named for her: Virginia and West Virginia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay! This cannot be true. No woman can rule alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe not only rules alone but does a damn fine job of it. Did a great job of it. She made England the ruling power of all Europe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to believe me; it\u2019s history.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Nicholas was thoughtful. \u201cHistory, yes. All that has happened to me, to my family, is now history, so perhaps all of it is recorded somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Dougless said, smiling. \u201cYou think maybe you were sent forward to find out something? How intriguing,\u201d she said, then frowned. \u201cI mean if it were possible for a person to have been sent forward, it would be intriguing. But since it isn\u2019t possible, it\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>His look of puzzlement was beginning to become familiar to her. When he couldn\u2019t seem to figure out what she\u2019d just said, he continued. \u201cPerhaps there is something you know that I must find from you.\u201d He moved to stand over her. \u201cWhat do people of your time know of the Queen\u2019s decree against me? Who has told her I raise an army to overthrow her? This would be recorded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. My father used to get angry whenever he read something that said Elizabeth the First had an illegitimate child. My father said that every day of her life is documented, so it wasn\u2019t possible that she could have sneaked away and had a baby in secret.\u201d As she was saying this, Nicholas was looking at her with such intensity that she smiled. \u201cI have an idea. Why don\u2019t you stay here in this time period? Why go back at all? I\u2019m sure you could get a job. You\u2019d be great as an Elizabethan teacher. Or you could research and write. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d have enough to live on after the sale of your coins. If you invested carefully, that is. My father could help you invest, or my uncle J.T. could. Both of them know a lot about money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Nicholas said fiercely, his right fist clasped in his left hand. \u201cI must return to my own time. My honor is at risk. The future of the Staffords is at stake. If I do not go back, all will be forfeit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForfeit?\u201d Dougless asked, and a little shiver went up her spine. She knew enough about medieval history to have some idea what he was talking about. Her voice lowered. \u201cUsually a nobleman forfeited his estates to the king, or queen, when he was accused of . . .\u201d For a moment, she just looked up at him. \u201cTreason,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIn medieval times, people forfeited estates due to treason. And treason was paid for . . . in other ways.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cHow . . . how did you die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume I was executed.\u201d</p><p>SIX</p><p>Dougless forgot about the question of whether he was or was not from the sixteenth century. \u201cTell me what happened,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He paced a moment longer; then, after another look at the tomb, he went to sit by her. \u201cI have lands in Wales,\u201d he said softly. \u201cWhen I learned my lands were under attack, I raised an army. But in my haste to protect what was mine, I did not petition the queen for permission to raise this army. She was . . .\u201d</p><p>For a moment he looked into the distance, his eyes angry and hard. \u201cThe queen was told by someone . . .\u201d Pausing, he took a breath. \u201cShe was told that the army I was gathering was to join forces with the young Scots queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary Queen of Scots,\u201d Dougless said, and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cI was given a hasty trial and condemned to be beheaded. I had but three days left before I was to be executed when you . . . when you called me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re lucky!\u201d Dougless said. \u201cBeheading. Disgusting. We don\u2019t do that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no treason that you do not need to behead people?\u201d Nicholas asked. \u201cOr perhaps you punish the nobility in another way.\u201d He put up his hand when she started to answer. \u201cNay, we will discuss this later. My mother is a powerful woman and she has friends. From the moment I was taken, she has worked without rest to prove my innocence\u2014and she has made progress. She believes she is close to finding who betrayed me. I must return and prove that I am not guilty. If I do not, she will lose all. She will be a pauper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe queen would take everything you own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll. It would be as though I truly were a traitor.\u201d</p><p>Dougless thought about what he\u2019d told her. Of course none of what he was saying was real, but if it were, perhaps there was something to be learned today from the history books. \u201cDo you have any idea who told the queen your army was going to be used to take her throne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not sure, but when I came forward, I was writing a letter to my mother. At last I had remembered a man from some ten years ago who may have had a grudge against me. I had been told that he was now at court. Perhaps he . . .\u201d Trailing off, Nicholas put his head in his hands in despair.</p><p>Dougless almost reached out to him to touch his hair, perhaps to rub his neck, but she withdrew. She reminded herself that this man\u2019s problems were not her own, and there was no reason on earth she should spend her time trying to help him find out why he\u2014or maybe one of his ancestors\u2014had been unjustly accused of treason.</p><p>On the other hand, the idea of injustice made Dougless\u2019s skin crawl. Maybe it was in her blood. Her grandfather, Hank Montgomery, had been a union organizer before he returned home to Maine to run the family business, Warbrooke Shipping. To this day, her grandfather hated any type of injustice and would risk his life to stop it.</p><p>\u201cAs I told you, my father is a professor of medieval history,\u201d Dougless said softly, \u201cand I\u2019ve helped him do some research. Maybe I could help you find what you\u2019re looking for. And, besides, how many people are you going to find who are in such a situation that they\u2019d even consider helping a man wearing a sword and balloon shorts?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stood up. \u201cYou refer to my slops? You jest at my clothing? These . . . these . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrousers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, these trousers. They bind a man\u2019s legs so that I cannot bend. And these,\u201d he said as he put his hands in his pockets. \u201cThey are so small that I can carry nothing. And last night I was cold in the rain and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re cool today,\u201d she said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cAnd this.\u201d He pulled back the fly to show the zipper. \u201cThis can hurt a man.\u201d</p><p>Dougless began to laugh. \u201cIf you wore your underwear instead of leaving it on the bed, maybe the zipper wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderwear? What is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElastic, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d he said, and began to smile.</p><p>Dougless suddenly thought, What else do I have to do? Cry some more? Six of her women friends had taken her out to dinner before she left for England to wish her bon voyage. There had been a lot of laughter about her romantic holiday. Yet here she was wanting to go home after just five days.</p><p>Looking up at this smiling man, Dougless wondered, if she were honest with herself, would she rather spend four and a half weeks with Robert and Gloria, or would she rather help this man research what may or may not be his previous life? Smiling back at Nicholas, she thought that the whole thing reminded her of a ghost story where the heroine goes to the library and reads about the curse on the house she\u2019s rented for the summer.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she heard herself say. \u201cI will help you.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas sat down by her, took her hand in his, and fervently kissed the back of it. \u201cYou are a lady at heart.\u201d</p><p>She was smiling at the top of his head, but his words made her smile disappear. \u201cAt heart? Are you saying that I\u2019m not a lady elsewhere?\u201d</p><p>He gave a little shrug. \u201cWho can fathom why God has joined me with a commoner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you\u2014\u201d she began. It was on the tip of her tongue to tell him that her uncle was the king of Lanconia and she often spent summers playing with her six cousins, the princes and princesses. But something stopped her. Let him think what he wanted. \u201cShould I address you as \u2018your lordship\u2019?\u201d she asked archly.</p><p>Nicholas frowned thoughtfully. \u201cI have considered that question. Now, when no one knows of my titles, I can move about unharmed. And these clothes, they are the clothes of all the people. I cannot understand your sumptuary laws. I am sure I should hire retainers, yet in this time a shirt costs a man\u2019s yearly wage. Try as I might, I cannot understand your ways. Often I . . .\u201d He looked away. \u201cOften, I make a fool of myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, well, I do that and I\u2019ve grown up in this century,\u201d Dougless said lightly.</p><p>\u201cBut you are a woman,\u201d he said, looking back at her.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s get one thing straight: in this century women aren\u2019t men\u2019s slaves. We women today say what we want to say and do what we want to do. We know we weren\u2019t put on this earth only to entertain men.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s mouth dropped open in astonishment. \u201cIs this what is believed today of women of my time? You believe that our women were for pleasure only?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cObedient, docile, locked away in a castle somewhere, kept pregnant, and never allowed to go to school.\u201d</p><p>Emotions ran across Nicholas\u2019s face: astonishment, anger, disbelief. At last, his face relaxed and he smiled, his eyes full of merriment. \u201cWhen I return, I will tell my mother what is believed about her. My mother has buried three husbands.\u201d Laughter made his lips twitch. \u201cKing Henry said my mother\u2019s husbands wished themselves into the grave because they weren\u2019t half the man she is. Docile? Nay, lady, not docile. No schooling? My mother speaks four languages and argues philosophy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen your mother is an exception. I\u2019m sure most women are\u2014were\u2014downtrodden and brutalized. They had to be. They were the property of the men. Chattel.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a piercing stare. \u201cAnd in your day men are noble? They do not abandon women? They do not leave them to the mercy of the elements, with no means of support, no protection, no funds to so much as find a night\u2019s lodging?\u201d</p><p>Dougless turned away, blushing. So maybe she wasn\u2019t in a good position to argue about this. \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve made your point.\u201d She looked back at him. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s get down to business. First we go to a drugstore, or chemist, as it\u2019s called here in England, and we buy toiletries.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI need eyeshadow, base, blush, and I\u2019d kill for a tube of lipstick right now. And we need toothbrushes, toothpaste, and floss.\u201d Halting, she looked at him. \u201cLet me see your teeth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMadam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me see your teeth,\u201d she repeated in a no-nonsense voice. If he were an overworked graduate student, he\u2019d have fillings, but if he were from the sixteenth century no dentist would have touched his mouth.</p><p>After a moment, Nicholas obediently opened his mouth, and Dougless moved his head this way and that to look inside. He had three molars missing and there looked to be a cavity in another tooth, but there was no sign of modern dental work. \u201cWe need to get you to a dentist and take care of that cavity.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, Nicholas pulled away from her. \u201cThe tooth does not pain me enough to have it pulled,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cIs that why you have three teeth missing? They were pulled?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to think this was obvious, so Dougless opened her mouth, showed him her fillings, and tried to explain what a dentist was.</p> <p>\u201cAh, there you are,\u201d said the vicar from the back of the church. \u201cSo you two have become friends.\u201d His eyes were twinkling.</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t . . .\u201d Dougless began, intending to explain that they hadn\u2019t become the friends that the vicar\u2019s tone was implying. But she stopped. The truth would take too much explanation. She stood up. \u201cWe have to go, as we have a great deal to do. Nicholas, are you ready?\u201d</p><p>Smiling at her, Nicholas offered her his arm, and they left the church together. Outside, Dougless paused for a moment and looked at the enclosed graveyard. It had been just yesterday that Robert had left her here.</p><p>\u201cWhat shines there?\u201d Nicholas asked, looking at one of the grave markers.</p><p>It was the gravestone Gloria had fallen against, then lied to Robert about her scrapes, saying Dougless had hurt her. Curious, Dougless went to the stone. At the bottom, hidden by grass and dirt, was Gloria\u2019s five-thousand-dollar diamond and emerald bracelet. Picking it up, Douglass held it up to the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cThe quality of the diamonds is good, not excellent,\u201d Nicholas said as he peered over her shoulder. \u201cThe emeralds are but cheap.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Dougless clasped the bracelet tightly in her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll find him now,\u201d she said. \u201cNow he\u2019ll come back for sure.\u201d Quickly, she went into the church and told the vicar that should Robert Whitley call and ask about a lost bracelet, he was to say that Dougless had it; then she gave him the name of the bed-and-breakfast where she and Nicholas were staying.</p><p>As Dougless left the church, she felt jubilant. Everything was going to work out now. Robert would be so grateful that she\u2019d found the bracelet that . . . Her mind flooded with visions of Robert\u2019s protestations of undying love and endless apologies. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I could miss anyone as much as I missed you,\u201d ran through her head in Robert\u2019s tearful voice. \u201cHow can you forgive me?\u201d and \u201cI wanted to teach you a lesson, but I was the one who learned from you. Oh, Dougless, can you\u2014?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, looking up at Nicholas blankly.</p><p>He was frowning. \u201cYou said we must see an alchemist. Do you prepare new spells?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother to defend herself; she was too happy to allow anything he said to bother her. \u201cNot \u2018alchemist,\u2019 a chemist\u2019s,\u201d she said happily. \u201cLet\u2019s go shopping.\u201d</p><p>As they walked, she made a mental list of the things she\u2019d need to be looking her best when she saw Robert again. She needed products for her face and hair, and she\u2019d need a new blouse that didn\u2019t have a cut sleeve.</p><p>First they went to the coin dealer and sold another coin, this one for fifteen hundred pounds. There Dougless called the B and B to reserve their room for three more nights because the dealer had said he needed time to find a buyer for Nicholas\u2019s rarer coins. And to give Robert time to find me, Dougless thought.</p><p>Then they went to a chemist\u2019s shop. As the doors to a magnificent English drugstore, a Boots, opened, even Dougless looked about in awe. The English didn\u2019t fill their shelves with gaudily packaged over-the-counter medicines\u2014even cough syrup was kept behind the counter\u2014but, instead, the shelves were full of products that smelled good. Within minutes, Dougless, a canvas shopping basket at her feet, was trying to decide between mango shampoo or jasmine. And should she get the aloe face pack or the cucumber? she wondered as she tossed a bottle of lavender-scented conditioner into the basket.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Nicholas whispered, looking at the many rows of gaily wrapped packages.</p><p>\u201cShampoo, deodorant, toothpaste, all the usual stuff,\u201d Dougless said distractedly. She had lemon verbena body lotion in one hand and evening primrose in the other. Which?</p><p>\u201cI know not those words.\u201d</p><p>Dougless\u2019s head was full of the decisions she was trying to make, but then she looked at the products as an Elizabethan man must see them\u2014if Nicholas were from the past, which of course he wasn\u2019t, she reminded herself. Her father had said that until recently, people had made all their toiletries at home.</p><p>\u201cThis is shampoo to wash your hair,\u201d she said as she opened a bottle of papaya-scented shampoo. \u201cSmell.\u201d</p><p>At first whiff, Nicholas smiled at her in delight, then he nodded toward the other bottles, and Douglass began opening them. With each product, Nicholas\u2019s face showed his wonder. \u201cThis is marvelous. These are heaven. How I\u2019d like to send one of these to my queen.\u201d</p><p>She recapped a bottle of hyacinth-scented conditioner. \u201cIs this the same queen who cut off your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had been lied to,\u201d Nicholas said stiffly, making Dougless shake her head. An American had a difficult time understanding such loyalty to the monarchy.</p><p>\u201cI have heard that she is especially fond of what smells good,\u201d Nicholas said, picking up a bottle of men\u2019s aftershave. \u201cMayhap they have washed gloves here,\u201d he said, looking about.</p><p>\u201cWashed? You mean clean gloves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScented skin but no scented gloves,\u201d Dougless said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cAh, well,\u201d he said slowly, then looked at her in a way that threatened to make her blush. \u201cI needs must make do with scented skin.\u201d</p><p>Quickly, Dougless looked down at the rows of shaving products. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t consider shaving that beard of yours, would you?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas ran his hand over his beard, seeming to consider her words. \u201cI have seen no man with a beard now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome men still wear beards, but, on the whole, they\u2019re not fashionable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will find a barber and shave it,\u201d he said finally, then paused. \u201cYou have barbers now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe still have barbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this barber is the one you will have put silver in my sore tooth?\u201d</p><p>Dougless laughed. \u201cNot quite. Barbers and dentists are separate professions now. Why don\u2019t you pick out a shaving lotion while I get foam and razors?\u201d Picking up the portable shopping basket, she saw that she had nearly filled it with shampoo, cream rinse, combs, toothbrushes, toothpaste, floss, and a small electric travel set of hair rollers. Minutes later, she was happily looking over the makeup when she heard a noise from the other side of the shelves. Nicholas was trying to get her attention.</p><p>When she went around the corner, she saw that he\u2019d opened a tube of toothpaste and the white cream had squirted down the front of the racks.</p><p>\u201cI but meant to smell it,\u201d he said rigidly, and Dougless could feel his deep embarrassment.</p><p>Grabbing a box of tissues from a shelf, she opened it, took out a handful, and began to clean the counter.</p><p>At the wonder of the tissues, Nicholas lost his embarrassment. \u201cThis is paper,\u201d he said, feeling the soft tissues, wonder in his voice. \u201cHere, stop that!\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot waste paper. It is too valuable, and this paper has not been used before.\u201d</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t understand what he was talking about. \u201cYou use a tissue once, then throw it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your century so rich as this?\u201d he asked, then ran his hand over his face as though to clear his mind. \u201cI do not understand this. Paper is so valuable it is used in place of gold, yet paper is so worthless, it can be used for cleaning, then thrown away.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Dougless thought of how all paper in the sixteenth century was handmade. \u201cI guess we are rich in goods,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe richer than we should be.\u201d She put the opened tissue box in her basket, then continued choosing items they needed. She bought shaving cream, razors, and deodorant, washcloths for both of them (because the English hotels didn\u2019t supply them), and a full set of cosmetics for herself.</p><p>When she went to checkout, once again, she took charge of Nicholas\u2019s modern money. And once again he was nearly sick when he heard the total. \u201cI can buy a horse for what this bottle costs,\u201d he mumbled when she read a price to him. After she paid, she lugged the two shopping bags full of goods out of the store. Nicholas did not offer to take the bags from her, so she guessed that only bags full of armor were masculine enough for him to carry.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take these back to the hotel,\u201d she said. \u201cThen we can\u2014\u201d She broke off because Nicholas had stopped in front of a shop window. Yesterday he\u2019d had eyes only for the street, for gaping at cars, for feeling the surface of the pavement, and for staring at the people. Today he was more interested in the other side of the street, as he kept noticing the shops, marveling at the plate-glass windows, and frequently touching the lettering of the signs.</p><p>He had halted in front of a bookstore window. On prominent display was a big, beautiful coffee table edition of a book on medieval armor. Beside it were books on Henry the Eighth and Elizabeth the First. Nicholas\u2019s eyes were as wide as dinner plates. Turning, he pointed at the books, then opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she said, smiling, as she pulled him inside. Whatever troubles of her own that Dougless had, she soon forgot them when she saw the wonder and joy on Nicholas\u2019s face as he reverently touched the books. After dropping off the shopping bags at the counter, she walked about the store with Nicholas. Some big, expensive books were lying faceup on a table just inside the door, and he ran his fingertips slowly over the glossy photos.</p><p>\u201cThey are magnificent,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI have never imagined such as these could exist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s your Queen Elizabeth,\u201d Dougless said, lifting a large color volume.</p><p>As though he were almost afraid to touch it, Nicholas gingerly took the book from Dougless.</p><p>Watching him, Dougless could almost believe that he\u2019d never seen a modern color photo before. She knew that in Elizabethan times books were precious and rare, prized possessions owned by only the richest of people. If the books had pictures, they were woodcuts or hand-colored illuminations.</p><p>She watched as Nicholas reverently opened the book he held and ran his hand over the glossy photos. \u201cWho has painted these? Do you have so many painters now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the books were printed by a machine.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas looked at a picture of Queen Elizabeth the First. \u201cWhat is it she wears? Is the shape of this sleeve the new fashion? My mother would know of this.\u201d</p><p>Dougless looked at the date: 1582. She took the book from him. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you should look at the future.\u201d What was she saying?! 1582 the future? \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look at this book?\u201d she said as she handed him Birds of the World. Her reaction was, of course, absurd, because any moment now, this man was going to regain his memory. However, just to be safe, she didn\u2019t want to tamper with changing history because a medieval man had seen the future. Except of course what history they changed if they saved his life. But that\u2014</p><p>Dougless\u2019s attention was taken from her thoughts when Nicholas almost dropped the book because the music system, which had been silent until then, suddenly began to play. Twisting about, Nicholas looked around the store. \u201cI see no musicians. And what is that music? Is it ragtime?\u201d</p><p>Dougless laughed. \u201cWhere\u2019d you hear of ragtime? No,\u201d she corrected herself, \u201cI mean, your memory must be returning if you\u2019re remembering ragtime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Beasley,\u201d he said, referring to the woman who ran the bed-and-breakfast. \u201cI played for her from her music, but it was not like this music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlayed for her on what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is like a large harpsichord, but it sounded most different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a piano.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have not told me what is the source of the music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s classical music. Beethoven, I think, and it comes from a cassette in a machine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMachines,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAgain machines.\u201d</p><p>As Dougless watched him, she had an idea. Perhaps she could use music to help bring his memory back.</p><p>Along one wall of the store was a selection of cassette tapes. She chose Beethoven, excerpts from La Traviata, and some Irish folk music. She started to choose the Rolling Stones, but then thought she ought to get something more modern, but her thought made her laugh at herself. \u201cMozart is new to him,\u201d she said as she took the Stones tape off the shelf. \u201cMaybe.\u201d On the bottom shelf were some inexpensive cassette players for sale, so she bought one that included earphones.</p><p>When she went back to Nicholas, he had moved to the stationery section of the store and was gingerly touching the wide selection of papers. Dougless picked up a spiral notebook and began demonstrating felt-tip pens, ballpoints, and mechanical pencils. Nicholas made a few squiggles on the testing paper, but she noticed that he didn\u2019t write words. For all that, according to him, his mother was a scholar of great magnitude, Dougless wondered if he could read and write, but she didn\u2019t ask him.</p> <p>They left the store with another shopping bag, this one full of spiral notebooks, felt-tips of every color imaginable, cassettes and a player, plus six travel books. Three of the travel books were on England, one about America, and two were about the world. On impulse she\u2019d also purchased a set of Winsor and Newton watercolors and a block of watercolor paper for Nicholas. She somehow felt that he might like to paint. She also tucked in an Agatha Christie.</p><p>\u201cCould we take these bags back to the hotel now?\u201d Dougless asked. Her arms felt as if they were lengthening from carrying the heavy bags.</p><p>But Nicholas had stopped again, this time in front of a women\u2019s clothing store. \u201cYou will purchase yourself new clothing,\u201d he said, and it was an order.</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t like his tone. \u201cI have my own clothes, and when I get them, I will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will travel with no beldame,\u201d he said stiffly.</p> <p>Dougless wasn\u2019t sure what the word meant, but she could guess. She looked at her reflection in the glass. If she thought she had looked bad yesterday, she had surpassed herself today. There was a time for pride and a time for being sensible. Without another word, she handed him the bag with the books. \u201cWait for me over there,\u201d she said in the same tone of command that he had used on her, as she pointed to a wooden bench under a tree.</p><p>After taking the bag with the cosmetics, Dougless straightened her shoulders and entered the shop.</p><p>It took over an hour, but when Dougless returned to him, she didn\u2019t look like the same person. Her auburn hair, wildly unkempt from days without care, was now pulled back off her face and, neatly combed, it fell back in soft waves to the silk scarf she\u2019d used to tie it at the nape of her neck. Softly applied cosmetics brought out the beauty of her face. She was not a beauty of the type that looked fragile and overbred, but Dougless was healthy and wholesome-looking, as though she\u2019d grown up on a horse ranch in Kentucky or on a sailboat in Maine\u2014which she had.</p><p>She\u2019d chosen clothes that were simple, but exquisitely made: a teal Austrian jacket; a paisley skirt of teal, plum, and navy; a plum silk blouse; and boots of soft navy leather. On impulse she\u2019d also purchased navy kid gloves and a navy leather handbag, as well as a full set of lingerie and a nightgown.</p><p>Carrying her shopping bags, she crossed the road toward Nicholas, and when he saw her, she was pleased by his incredulous expression. \u201cWell?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBeauty knows no time,\u201d he said softly, rising, then kissing her hand.</p> <p>There were advantages to Elizabethan men, she thought.</p><p>\u201cIs it time for tea yet?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Dougless groaned. Men were timeless, she thought. It was always: You-look-great-what\u2019s-for-dinner?</p><p>\u201cWe are now going to experience one of the worst aspects of England, and that is lunch. Breakfast is great; tea is great. Dinner is great if you like butter and cream, but lunch is . . . indescribable.\u201d</p><p>He was listening to her with concentration, as one does when hearing a foreign language. \u201cWhat is this \u2018lunch\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d Dougless said as she led the way to a nearby pub. Pubs were one of the things Dougless liked best about England, as they were family oriented, but you could still have a drink. After they\u2019d settled into a booth, Dougless ordered two cheese salad sandwiches, a pint of beer for him, a lemonade for her; then she proceeded to tell Nicholas the difference between a bar in America and a pub in England.</p><p>\u201cThere are more unescorted women?\u201d he asked in amazement.</p><p>\u201cMore than just me?\u201d she asked, smiling. \u201cThere are lots of independent women today. We have our own jobs, our own credit cards. We don\u2019t have, or need, men to take care of us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what of cousins and uncles? Do these women have no sons to look after them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that now. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d She stopped talking when the waitress put their sandwiches before them. But they were not sandwiches as Americans know them. An English cheese sandwich was a piece of cheese on two pieces of buttered white bread. A cheese salad sandwich had a small piece of lettuce on it. The sandwich was small, dry, tasteless.</p><p>Nicholas watched her as she picked up the strange-looking food and began to eat it; then he followed her lead.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt has no flavor,\u201d he said, then took a drink of his beer. \u201cNor does the beer.\u201d</p><p>Dougless looked about the pub and asked if it was anything like the public houses in the sixteenth century. Not that she believed he was . . . The heck with it, she thought.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d he answered. \u201cThere is gloom and quiet here. There is no danger here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s good. Peace and safety are good.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas shrugged as he ate the rest of the sandwich in two bites. \u201cI prefer flavor in my food and flavor in my public houses.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she started to stand up. \u201cAre you ready to go? We still have lots to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave? But where is dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just ate it.\u201d</p><p>He raised one eyebrow at her. \u201cWhere is the landlord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man behind the bar seems to be in charge, and I saw a woman behind the counter. Maybe she cooks. Wait a minute, Nicholas, don\u2019t make a fuss. The English don\u2019t like for people to cause problems. If you\u2019ll wait a minute, I\u2019ll go and\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Nicholas was already halfway to the counter. \u201cFood is food, no matter what the year. No, madam, stay where you are and I will procure us a proper dinner.\u201d</p><p>As Dougless watched, Nicholas talked earnestly to the bartender for a few moments; then the woman was called over and she, too, listened to Nicholas. When Dougless saw the man and woman scurrying away to do whatever they\u2019d been told, it occurred to her that if Nicholas learned his way around the twentieth century, he might be a bit of a problem.</p><p>Moments later he returned to the booth, and minutes afterward, dishes of food began to be placed on the table. There was chicken, beef, a big pork pie, bowls of vegetables, one of salad, and a nasty looking dark beer was set before Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cNow, Mistress Montgomery,\u201d he said when the table was loaded with food, \u201chow do you propose to find my way home?\u201d</p><p>When she looked up at him, his eyes were twinkling and she knew that, for once, she had been the one wearing the incredulous expression. It was his turn to be the one who knew how to do something she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cChalk one up for you,\u201d she said, laughing as she speared a chicken leg. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask the cook if she knows any good witches\u2019 spells?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps if we mix all those bottles you bought . . .\u201d Nicholas said, his mouth full of English beef. \u201cOw!\u201d he said when he nearly pierced his tongue with the fork he was trying to learn to use.</p><p>\u201cForget the witchcraft,\u201d she said as she withdrew a spiral notebook and a pen from a bag. \u201cI have to know all about you before we can start research.\u201d Perhaps now, with dates and places, she\u2019d trip him up.</p><p>But nothing she asked him even slowed him down as he ate plateful after plateful of food. He was born the sixth of June, 1537.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s your full name, or, I guess, in your case, what\u2019s your title?\u201d She was eating mashed parsnips with her left hand, writing with her right.</p><p>\u201cNicholas Stafford, earl of Thornwyck, Buckshire, and Southeaton, lord of Farlane.\u201d</p><p>Dougless blinked. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few baronetcies, but none of great importance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much for barons,\u201d she said as she had him repeat what he\u2019d said so she could write it down. Next, she began to list the properties he owned. There were estates from East Yorkshire to South Wales, plus more land in France and Ireland.</p><p>When her head was beginning to whirl with all the names, she closed her notebook. \u201cI think that with all that we should be able to find something about you\u2014him,\u201d she said, her tone showing her understatement.</p><p>After \u201clunch\u201d they stopped in a barbershop so Nicholas could be shaved. When he sat up in the chair, clean shaven at last, Dougless took a moment to catch her breath. Hidden under the beard and mustache had been a full-lipped mouth of great sensitivity.</p><p>\u201cI will do, madam?\u201d he asked, softly chuckling at her expression.</p><p>\u201cPassable,\u201d she said, trying to sound as though she\u2019d seen better. But as she walked ahead of him, his laugh filled her ears. Vain! she thought. He was much too vain!</p><p>When they returned to the bed-and-breakfast, the landlady said a room with a private bath had come vacant. A sane, sensible part of Dougless knew she should ask for a room of her own, but she didn\u2019t open her mouth when the landlady looked at her in question. Besides, Dougless told herself, when Robert came for her, it might be good for him to see her with this divine-looking man.</p><p>After she and Nicholas had moved what little they had into the new room, they went to the church and spoke to the vicar, but there was no word from Robert for her, nor any inquiries about the bracelet. They went to a grocery and bought cheese and fruit; to a butcher for meat pies; to a baker for bread, scones, and pastries; then to a winery, where they purchased two bottles of wine.</p><p>By teatime, Dougless was exhausted.</p><p>\u201cMy purse bearer looks sinking-ripe,\u201d Nicholas said, smiling at her.</p><p>Dougless felt exactly like sinking-ripe sounded. Together they walked back to their little hotel, where they took the bag containing the new books to the garden. Mrs. Beasley served them tea and scones, and gave them a blanket to spread on the grass. Nicholas and Dougless sat on the blanket, drank tea, ate the scones, and looked at the books. It was heavenly English weather, cool yet warm, sunny but not brilliant. The garden was green and lush, the roses fragrant. Dougless was sitting up; Nicholas stretched before her on his stomach as he ate scones with one hand and carefully turned pages with the other.</p><p>The cotton shirt he wore was stretched across his back muscles, and the trousers clung to his thighs. Black curls brushed his collar. Dougless found herself looking at him more than at the travel book she was thumbing through.</p><p>\u201cIt is here!\u201d Nicholas said, rolling over and sitting up so abruptly Dougless\u2019s tea splashed out. \u201cMy newest house is here.\u201d He shoved the book at her as she put down her cup.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Thornwyck Castle,\u2019\u201d she read beside the full page photo, \u201c\u2018begun in 1563 by Nicholas Stafford, earl of Thornwyck . . .\u2019 \u201d She glanced at him. He was lying on his back, his hands behind his head, and smiling angelically, as though he\u2019d at last found some proof of his existence. \u201c\u2018. . . was confiscated by Queen Elizabeth the First in 1564 when . . .\u2019 \u201d She trailed off.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Nicholas said softly, but he was no longer smiling.</p><p>\u201c\u2018. . . when the earl was found guilty of treason and sentenced to be beheaded. There was some doubt of Stafford\u2019s guilt, but all investigation stopped when\u2019 \u201d\u2014Dougless\u2019s voice lowered\u2014\u201c \u2018when three days before his execution the earl was found dead in his cell. He had been writing a letter to his mother when he apparently died of a heart attack. He was found with his head face down on a table, the letter to his mother\u2019\u201d\u2014she looked up and whispered\u2014\u201c\u2018unfinished.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Nicholas watched the clouds overhead and was silent for a while. \u201cDoes it say what became of my mother?\u201d he asked at last.</p><p>\u201cNo. The rest of the article describes the castle and says it was never finished. \u2018What had been completed fell into disrepair after the Civil War\u2019\u2014your Civil War, not mine\u2014\u2018then was renovated in 1824, for the James family, and\u2014\u2019\u201d She stopped. \u201c\u2018And now it\u2019s an exclusive hotel with a two-star restaurant!\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy house is a public house?\u201d Nicholas asked, obviously appalled. \u201cMy house was to be a center of learning and intelligence. It was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas, that was hundreds of years ago. I mean, maybe it was. Don\u2019t you see? Maybe we can get reservations to stay at this hotel. We can possibly stay at your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am to pay to stay in my own house?\u201d he asked, his upper lip curled in disgust.</p><p>She threw up her hands in despair. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t go. We\u2019ll just stay here and go shopping for the next twenty years, and you can spend all your time badgering pub owners into serving you medieval banquets every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a sharp tongue on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see the truth, if that\u2019s what you mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept about men who abandon you.\u201d</p><p>She started to get up, but he caught her hand.</p><p>\u201cI will pay,\u201d he said, looking up at her, but he began caressing the fingers of the hand he held. \u201cYou will remain with me?\u201d</p><p>She pulled her hand out of his grasp. \u201cA bargain\u2019s a bargain. I\u2019ll help you find out what you need to know so maybe you can clear your ancestor\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas smiled. \u201cSo now I am my own ancestor?\u201d</p><p>With a look at him that said she could do without his sarcasm, she went into the house to call Thornwyck Castle. At first the reservations clerk haughtily told her that reservations needed to be made a year in advance, but there was a commotion and a moment later the clerk returned to say that, unexpectedly, their best suite was currently available. Dougless said, \u201cYes!\u201d without asking the price.</p><p>As she hung up, Dougless realized she wasn\u2019t surprised by the coincidence of a room becoming available. It was beginning to seem as though a kind of wish therapy was at work. Every time she wished for something, she got it. She\u2019d wished for a Knight in Shining Armor and he had appeared. Maybe her wish had been more of a metaphor than a desire for a man who believed he was from the sixteenth century and wore silver armor, but, still, she had received her wish. She\u2019d wished for money and a bag of coins worth hundreds of thousands of pounds had shown up. She needed a place to spend the night and that had appeared too. Now she needed a reservation to an exclusive hotel and of course the hotel had \u201cunexpectedly\u201d had a vacancy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dougless took Gloria\u2019s bracelet from her pocket and looked at it. It looked like something some rich, fat old man would give his twenty-years-younger mistress. What could Dougless wish for with Robert? That he\u2019d come to realize that his own daughter was a lying thief? She didn\u2019t want any parent to despise his own child. So where did that leave her? She wanted Robert, but his daughter and his love for his daughter came with him. How was she going to deal with that? Was she destined to be cast as the proverbial wicked stepmother no matter what she did?</p><p>Before Dougless went back to the garden, she called the vicarage and was again told that no one had called about the bracelet. She asked the vicar for a recommendation for a dentist, and when she was able to make an appointment, again due to a cancellation, for the next morning, Dougless almost laughed aloud. As she started back outside, she saw several American magazines on a table. There was Vogue, Harper\u2019s Bazaar, and Gentleman\u2019s Quarterly. Scooping them up, she took them outside and handed them to Nicholas.</p><p>Right away, there were some exclamations on his part when she explained that these beautiful \u201cbooks\u201d were actually disposable goods. Once he conquered his amazement, he started looking through the magazines, studying the ads and the clothes on the models with the intensity of a general studying battle campaigns. At first he hated the clothes, but by the end of the first magazine he was nodding his head as though he were beginning to understand.</p><p>Dougless picked up her Agatha Christie and began to read.</p> <p>\u201cYou will read aloud to me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>From the way he merely looked at the pictures of the books and magazines, she again thought that perhaps he didn\u2019t know how to read, so she read aloud as he looked at the photos in Gentleman\u2019s Quarterly.</p><p>At seven, they opened a bottle of wine, and ate cheese and bread and fruit. Nicholas insisted she read more of the mystery while they ate.</p><p>When it grew dark, they went upstairs to their room and the reality of the intimacy of sharing a room began to dawn on Dougless. But as the hours passed, it seemed more and more natural to spend all her time with this gentle man. Watching him look at the world through wonder-filled eyes was becoming a joy to her. And with each passing hour, her memory of Robert was becoming less distinct.</p><p>When they were alone in the room, Nicholas didn\u2019t allow her to feel awkward. After examining their private bathroom, he demanded to know where the tub was. To Dougless\u2019s American delight, there was a shower stall in the bathroom. But before she could explain how to use the shower, Nicholas had turned on the taps and sprayed himself with cold water. Then, both of them laughing, he bent over while she toweled his hair dry.</p> <p>She showed him how to use shampoo and cream rinse, then how to brush his teeth. \u201cTomorrow I\u2019ll show you how to shave,\u201d she said, smiling at him with his mouth full of toothpaste lather.</p><p>After she\u2019d showered and washed her hair, she put on the plain white nightgown she\u2019d bought and slipped into one of the twin beds. She and Nicholas had had a somewhat heated \u201cdiscussion\u201d about his bathing every day. The idea seemed to appall him. He\u2019d argued against chills and talked of how body oils protected a person. Dougless had countered by showing him a jar of cold cream. Nicholas said that washing off oils, then buying oil to replace what came for free, was absurd. Dougless had replied that if he didn\u2019t take a bath every day, people on the street and in the restaurants would start talking about how bad he smelled. At that horrible prospect, Nicholas went into the bathroom, shut the door, and she soon heard the water running.</p><p>He must have enjoyed himself, because he stayed in the shower so long that steam came rolling out from under the door. When he finally emerged, he was wearing only a towel about his h*ps and rubbing his wet hair with another towel.</p><p>There was an awkward moment when he looked up at her as she sat in bed, fresh-faced, wet hair slicked back, and Dougless\u2019s heart jumped into her throat.</p><p>But then Nicholas saw the table lamp beside her, and Dougless spent the next fifteen minutes answering questions about electric lights. Nicholas nearly drove her crazy with turning every switch in the room on and off until, to make him go to bed, she promised to read more to him. She looked away as he dropped his towel and climbed into his own bed wearing absolutely nothing. \u201cPajamas,\u201d she murmured. \u201cTomorrow we buy pajamas.\u201d</p><p>She read for only about thirty minutes before she realized that he was asleep, and, turning off the light, she snuggled down under the covers. She was just dozing off when Nicholas\u2019s thrashing made her sit up in alarm. The room was just light enough that she could see him flailing at the covers, rolling back and forth, as he moaned in the grips of a nightmare. Reaching across to his bed, she put her hand on his shoulder. \u201cNicholas,\u201d she whispered, but he didn\u2019t respond, and his thrashing increased. She shook his shoulder, but he still didn\u2019t wake.</p> <p>Throwing back the covers, she sat on the edge of the bed, and leaned over him. \u201cNicholas, wake up,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re having a nightmare.\u201d</p><p>Immediately, his strong arms reached out, and he pulled her to him.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d she said, struggling against his grip, but he didn\u2019t release her. Instead, he calmed his thrashing and seemed to be perfectly content to hold her to him as though she were a life-size stuffed toy.</p><p>Using all her strength, Dougless pried his arms from around her, then went back to her own bed. But she was no more under the covers than he began moving about and moaning again. Getting out of bed, she went back to stand over his bed. \u201cNicholas, you have to wake up,\u201d she said loudly, but her voice had no effect on him. He was kicking at the covers, his arms were flailing about, and judging from the expression on his face, he was reliving some truly horrible experience.</p><p>Sighing in resignation, Dougless pulled back the covers and slipped in beside him. Immediately, he clasped her to him as though he were a scared child and she his doll and, instantly, he settled back into a peaceful sleep. Dougless told herself she was a true martyr, and that she was doing this for him. But somewhere inside herself, she knew she was as lonely and as scared as he probably was. Putting her cheek in the hollow of his warm shoulder, she went to sleep in his arms.</p><p>She awoke before dawn, smiling even before she was fully aware that it was Nicholas\u2019s warm, big body next to hers that was making her feel so good. Her impulse was to turn in his arms and kiss that warm skin.</p><p>But as soon as she was fully aware of where she was, she opened her eyes, then eased out of bed and went to her own bed. For a while, she lay there alone, looking across the beds at him. He was sleeping so quietly, his black curls such a contrast to the white of the pillowcase. Was he her own Knight in Shining Armor? she wondered. Or would he eventually get his memory back and realize that he had a home somewhere in England?</p><p>Feeling a bit devilish, Dougless tiptoed out of bed, quietly pulled the new tape player from where she\u2019d hidden it on the windowsill\u2014she had been waiting for the right moment to show it to him\u2014then put in the Stones tape. Putting the player by Nicholas\u2019s head, she turned the volume up, then pressed play.</p> <p>When \u201cI Can\u2019t Get No Satisfaction\u201d blasted out, Nicholas came bolt upright in bed. Laughing at the expression of shock on his face, Dougless turned the music off before she woke the other guests.</p><p>Nicholas sat up in bed with a dazed look on his face. \u201cWhat chaos was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMusic,\u201d Dougless said, laughing; but as he continued to look shocked, she said, \u201cIt was a joke. It\u2019s time to get up, so I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dougless quit smiling when he didn\u2019t smile back. She guessed Elizabethan men didn\u2019t like practical jokes. Correction: Modern men who thought they were Elizabethan men didn\u2019t like practical jokes.</p><p>It was twenty minutes later when Dougless came sputtering out of the bathroom. \u201cYou put shampoo on my toothbrush!\u201d she said, wiping her tongue on a towel.</p><p>\u201cI, madam?\u201d Nicholas asked, an exaggerated look of innocence on his face.</p><p>\u201cWhy, you\u2014\u201d she said as she grabbed a pillow and tossed it at him. \u201cI\u2019ll get you for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore of your \u2018music\u2019 at dawn, mayhap?\u201d he said, fending off the pillow.</p><p>Dougless laughed. \u201cAll right, I guess I deserved it. Are you ready for breakfast?\u201d</p><p>At breakfast, Dougless told him of his dental appointment. She saw his grimace, but paid no attention to it. Everyone grimaced at the thought of going to the dentist. While he was eating, she got him to give her the names of some of his other estates besides Thornwyck, so, while he was at the dentist, she could go to the local library and see what she could find out.</p><p>Nicholas was quiet as they walked to the dentist, and in the waiting room he didn\u2019t examine the plastic-covered chairs. Dougless knew he was really worried when he wouldn\u2019t even look at the plastic plant she pointed out to him. When the receptionist called him, Dougless squeezed his hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll be all right. Afterward I\u2019ll . . . I\u2019ll take you out and buy you ice cream. That\u2019s something to look forward to.\u201d But she knew he had no idea what ice cream was\u2014didn\u2019t remember what ice cream was, she corrected herself.</p><p>Since she\u2019d booked him for a checkup, at least one filling and a cleaning, she knew he\u2019d be in the chair for a while, so she asked the receptionist to call her at the library when he was nearly finished.</p><p>As she walked to the library, she felt as a mother must feel at having left her child behind. \u201cIt\u2019s only the dentist,\u201d she told herself.</p><p>The Ashburton library was very small, oriented toward children\u2019s books and novels for adults. Dougless sat on a stool in the British travel section and began searching for any mention of the eleven estates Nicholas said he\u2019d owned. Four were now ruins, two had been torn down in the 1950s (it made her sick to think they\u2019d survived so long and been torn down so recently), one was Thornwyck Castle, one she couldn\u2019t find, two were private residences, and one was open to the public. She copied down the pertinent information about the estate open to the public\u2014hours, days open\u2014then looked at her watch. Nicholas had been in the dentist\u2019s an hour and a half now.</p><p>She searched through the card catalog, but could find nothing on the Stafford family. Another forty-five minutes went by.</p><p>When the telephone on the checkout desk rang, she jumped. The librarian told Dougless it was the dentist calling and that Nicholas was nearly finished. Dougless practically ran back to the dentist\u2019s office.</p><p>The dentist came out to greet her and asked her to come to his office. \u201cMr. Stafford puzzles me,\u201d the doctor said, as he put Nicholas\u2019s X-rays on a wall-lit machine. \u201cI usually make it a policy to never give an opinion about another doctor\u2019s work, but as you can see here,\u201d he said, pointing at the X-ray, \u201cMr. Stafford\u2019s previous dental work has been . . . Well, I can only describe it as brutal. The three teeth that have been extracted look as though they were literally torn from his mouth. See, here and here the bone was cracked and grew back crooked. The extractions must have been extremely painful afterward as the bone healed. And, too, I know it\u2019s impossible, but I don\u2019t believe Mr. Stafford has ever seen a hypodermic before. Perhaps he was put under when he had those teeth removed.\u201d</p><p>The doctor turned off the light. \u201cOf course he had to have been put under. In this day and age we can\u2019t imagine the pain that extractions such as these must have caused him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis day and age,\u201d Dougless said softly. \u201cBut four hundred years ago teeth were, as you said, \u2018torn\u2019 from a person\u2019s mouth?\u201d</p><p>The doctor smiled. \u201cFour hundred years ago I imagine that everyone had extractions like his\u2014but without anesthetic or painkillers afterward. And, yes, I imagine a lot of people went away with cracked jawbones.\u201d</p><p>Dougless took a deep breath. \u201cHow were his teeth otherwise? How was he as a patient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent on both counts. He was very relaxed in the chair, and laughed when the hygienist asked if she\u2019d hurt him when she\u2019d cleaned his teeth. I filled one cavity and checked his other teeth.\u201d The doctor looked puzzled for a moment. \u201cHe has some slight ridging on his teeth. I\u2019ve only seen that in school textbooks, and it usually means hunger for a year or so as a child. I wonder what could have caused such ridging in him? He doesn\u2019t strike me as a man whose family couldn\u2019t afford food.\u201d</p><p>Drought, Dougless almost said. Or flooding. Something to make the crops fail in a time of no refrigeration or frozen food or fresh food flown in from around the world.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to keep you,\u201d the doctor said when Dougless said nothing. \u201cIt was just that I was concerned about his previous dental work. He . . .\u201d The doctor chuckled. \u201cHe certainly asked a lot of questions. He isn\u2019t by chance thinking of going to dental school?\u201d</p><p>Dougless smiled. \u201cHe\u2019s just curious. Thank you so much for your time and your concern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I had the cancellations. He has a most interesting set of teeth.\u201d</p><p>Dougless thanked him again, then went into the reception room to see Nicholas leaning across the counter flirting with the pretty receptionist.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d she snapped at him after she\u2019d paid the bill. She hadn\u2019t meant to be so short-tempered, but it seemed that circumstances were trying to force her to believe that this man actually was from the sixteenth century.</p><p>\u201cThat is not the barber I have been to,\u201d Nicholas said, smiling, rubbing his still-numb lip. \u201cI should like to take that man and his machines back with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the machines are electric,\u201d Dougless said gloomily. \u201cI doubt that Elizabethan houses were wired for the two-twenty they have in this country.\u201d</p><p>Catching her arm, Nicholas turned her to face him. \u201cWhat ails you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she cried, looking up at him. \u201cWhy do you have ridges on your teeth? How did your jawbone get cracked when your other teeth were pulled?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas smiled at her because he could see that, at last, she was truly beginning to believe him. \u201cI am Nicholas Stafford, earl of Thornwyck, Buckshire, and Southeaton. Two days ago I was in a cell awaiting my execution and the year was 1564.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe it,\u201d Dougless said, looking away from his face. \u201cI will not believe it. Time travel cannot happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would make you believe?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>As Dougless walked with him toward the ice cream shop, she pondered the question. What would make her believe? she asked herself. But she could think of nothing. There seemed to be explanations for everything. He could be a fabulous actor and merely pretending that everything was new to him. His teeth could have been wrenched out while playing rugby in school. Since she could verify nearly everything he\u2019d told her, that meant he could have found the information previously, then used it in his charade. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Was there anything he could do to prove to her that he was from the past?</p><p>In the ice cream parlor she absently ordered herself a single cone of mocha ice cream, but for Nicholas, she ordered a double cone of French vanilla and chocolate fudge. She was considering her question so hard that she didn\u2019t see his face when he took his first licks, so she was startled when he leaned over and kissed her quickly, but firmly, on the mouth.</p><p>Blinking, she looked up at him and saw the sublime happiness on his face as he ate his ice cream. Dougless couldn\u2019t help laughing.</p><p>\u201cBuried treasure,\u201d she said, and startled herself with the words.</p> <p>\u201cMmm?\u201d Nicholas asked, his attention one hundred percent on his ice cream.</p><p>\u201cTo prove to me that you\u2019re from the past, you have to know something no one else does. You have to show me something that isn\u2019t in a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as who the father of Lady Arabella Sydney\u2019s last child was?\u201d He was down to the chocolate scoop and looked as though he might melt from happiness. Placing her hand under his elbow, she ushered him to a table.</p><p>Sitting across from him, looking at those blue eyes and thick lashes as he licked his cone, she wondered if he looked at a woman like that when he made love to her.</p><p>\u201cYou gaze at me most hard,\u201d he said, then looked at her through his lashes.</p> <p>Turning away, Dougless cleared her throat. \u201cI do not want to know who fathered Lady Arabella\u2019s kid.\u201d She didn\u2019t look back when she heard Nicholas\u2019s laugh.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Buried treasure,\u2019\u201d he said as he crunched the cone. \u201cSome valuable trinket that was hidden, but is still there after four hundred and twenty-four years?\u201d</p><p>He can add and subtract, Dougless thought as she looked back at him. \u201cForget about it. It was just an idea.\u201d She opened her notebook. \u201cLet me tell you what I found out at the library,\u201d she said as she began to read her notes about the houses.</p><p>When she looked up, Nicholas was wiping his hands on a paper napkin and frowning. \u201cA man builds so that something of himself lives on. It pleases me not to hear that what was mine is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought children were supposed to carry on a person\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left no children,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a son, but he died in a fall the week after my brother drowned. First his mother, then the child.\u201d</p> <p>Dougless watched pain shoot across his face and suddenly felt how easy and safe the twentieth century was. Sure, America had ra**sts and mass murderers and drunk drivers, but Elizabethans had plague and leprosy and smallpox. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cSorry both for you and for them.\u201d She paused a moment. \u201cHave you had smallpox?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cNeither small nor large,\u201d he said with some pride.</p><p>\u201cLarge pox?\u201d</p><p>He glanced about the room, then whispered, \u201cThe French disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, understanding. Venereal disease. For some reason she was glad to hear that he\u2019d never had \u201clarge pox\u201d\u2014not that it mattered, but they did share a bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this \u2018open to the public\u2019?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUsually the owners couldn\u2019t afford the houses, so they gave them to the National Trust, so now you pay money and a guide takes you through the house. They\u2019re great tours. This particular house has a tea shop and a gift shop and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nicholas suddenly sat up straight. \u201cIt is Bellwood that is open?\u201d</p> <p>She checked her notes. \u201cYes, Bellwood. Just south of Bath.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas seemed to be calculating. \u201cWith fast horses we can be to Bath in about seven hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a good English train we could make it in two hours. Would you like to see your house again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee my house sold to a company, with tallow-faced apron-men marching through it?\u201d</p><p>Dougless smiled. \u201cIf you put it like that . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we go on this . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrain to Bellwood now?\u201d</p><p>Dougless looked at her watch. \u201cSure. If we leave right now, we can have tea there and see Bellwood. But if you don\u2019t want to see the tallow-faced . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cApron-men,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cMarching through the house, then why go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a chance, a small chance, that I could, mayhap, find your buried treasure. When my estates were confiscated by your\u201d\u2014he looked at her mockingly\u2014\u201cyour Virgin Queen\u201d\u2014he let Dougless know what he thought of the absurdity of that idea\u2014\u201cI do not know if my family was given permission to clear the estates. Perhaps there is a chance . . .\u201d</p><p>The idea of an afternoon spent looking for buried treasure excited Dougless. \u201cWhat are we waiting for?\u201d she asked as she picked up her new handbag. This time, she\u2019d packed it full of travel-size toiletries, and she wasn\u2019t going anywhere without it.</p><p>The train system was another thing Dougless loved about England. Nearly every village had a station, and, unlike American trains, they were clean, with no graffiti, and well kept. When Dougless bought their tickets, she was told that a connecting train to Bath was just about to leave the station, which was not an unusual occurrence since the English trains were wonderfully frequent.</p><p>Once seated on the train and it started to move, Nicholas\u2019s eyes bulged at the speed. But, after a few nervous moments, like a true Englishman, he adjusted to the speed and began to walk around. He studied the ads high up on the walls, smiling in delight at one for Colgate, recognizing the toothpaste she\u2019d purchased. If he could recognize words, perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be so difficult to teach him to read, she thought.</p><p>In Bristol, they changed trains. Nicholas was aghast at the number of hurrying people in the station, and he was fascinated with the ornate Victorian ironwork. She purchased a fat guidebook to the great houses of southern England at the newsstand, and on the ride to Bath, she started to read to Nicholas about his houses that were now in ruins. But when she saw that hearing of such waste and destruction made him sad, she stopped reading.</p><p>He looked out the big windows and now and then would say, \u201cThere\u2019s William\u2019s house,\u201d or \u201cRobin lives there,\u201d when he saw one of the enormous houses that dotted the English countryside almost as frequently as did the cows and sheep.</p><p>Bath, beautiful, beautiful Bath, was a wonder to Nicholas. To Dougless it was old, since the architecture was all eighteenth century, but to him it was very modern. Dougless thought that New York or Dallas with its steel and glass buildings would look like outer space to him. He would act as though they looked weird, she corrected herself, then noticed that she was correcting herself less often with each hour she spent with him.</p><p>They had lunch at an American-type sandwich shop, and Dougless ordered club sandwiches, potato salad, and iced tea for both of them. He thought the meal was tasty but lacking in quantity. It took some fast talking, but Dougless managed to drag him out of the restaurant before he started demanding a boar\u2019s head or whatever.</p><p>He was so fascinated with the crescent-shaped rows of houses in Bath that Dougless hated to get a taxi and take him out of town. But getting into an automobile took Nicholas\u2019s mind off the buildings. The taxi drivers in England are a different breed from those in America. English drivers don\u2019t yell when someone takes \u201ctoo long\u201d to get into a car, so Nicholas was given time to look at the vehicle. He examined the door and the door lock, opening and closing it three times before getting in, and once in, after examining the backseat, he leaned forward and watched the driver steer and shift gears.</p><p>When they arrived at Bellwood, the next tour didn\u2019t start for half an hour, so they had time to walk around the gardens. Dougless thought they were beautiful, but Nicholas curled his lip and barely looked at the flowering plants and the ancient shade trees. When he walked around the big, sprawling house, he told her what had been added to the house and what had been changed. He thought the additions were architecturally dreadful and minced no words in telling her so.</p><p>\u201cIs the treasure buried in the garden?\u201d she asked, annoyed at herself for asking; she sounded like an excited child.</p><p>\u201cRuin a garden by putting gold at the roots of my plants?\u201d he asked in mock horror.</p><p>\u201cBy the way, where did you put your money? Where did they put their money, I mean?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas clearly didn\u2019t understand her question\u2014or didn\u2019t want to\u2014so she dropped it. Since the gardens seemed to be making him angry, she led him to the gift shop, and for a while, he was happy in the shop. He played with the pens and some plastic change purses, and he laughed aloud when he first saw a tiny flashlight with \u201cBellwood\u201d stamped on it. But he didn\u2019t like the postcards, and Dougless couldn\u2019t figure out what had so upset him about them.</p><p>He removed a tote bag with a silk-screened photo of Bellwood on the front from a rack. \u201cYou will need one of these,\u201d he said, smiling; then he leaned forward and whispered, \u201cFor the treasure.\u201d</p><p>Dougless did her best not to look thrilled at his words. As calmly as she could, she carried the tote bag and the flashlight to the register, where she paid for them and tickets for the next tour. She tried again to look at the postcards, but Nicholas would not let her. Every time she got near the rack, he forcibly clamped his strong fingers on her arm and pulled her away.</p><p>When the next tour was called, Dougless and Nicholas followed a dozen other tourists into the house. To Dougless\u2019s eyes, the interior of the house looked like a set for a play about Elizabeth the First. The walls were paneled in dark oak, there were Jacobean chairs scattered about as well as carved chests, and armor was hanging on the wall.</p><p>\u201cIs this more like what you\u2019re used to?\u201d Dougless whispered up to Nicholas.</p><p>There was an expression of disgust on his handsome face; his upper lip curled upward. \u201cThis is not my house,\u201d he said in distaste. \u201cThat what I did should come to this is most unpleasing.\u201d</p><p>Dougless thought the place was beautiful, but didn\u2019t say so because the guide had started her lecture. It was her experience that English tour guides were excellent and knew their subject thoroughly. The woman was telling the history of the house, built as a castle in 1302, by the first Stafford.</p><p>Nicholas was quiet as she spoke\u2014until she came to Henry the Eighth\u2019s time.</p><p>\u201cA medieval woman was the chattel of her husband,\u201d their guide said, \u201cto be used as her husband saw fit. Women had no power.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas snorted loudly. \u201cMy father told my mother she was his property\u2014once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSssh,\u201d Dougless hissed, not wanting to be embarrassed by him.</p><p>They moved to a small, oak-paneled room where the darkness was oppressive. \u201cCandles were very expensive,\u201d the guide was saying, \u201cso medieval man lived his life in gloom.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas again started to speak, but Dougless frowned at him to be quiet. \u201cStop complaining, and, by the way, where\u2019s your treasure?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI cannot seek treasure now. I must hear how your world thinks of mine,\u201d he said. \u201cPray tell me why your people think we had no mirth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all the plague and big pox and small, plus trips to the barber to have your teeth torn out, we think you didn\u2019t have time for fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe made use of the time we had,\u201d he said as the group moved into another room. As soon as they entered, Nicholas opened a door concealed in the paneling, and as soon as he did, a loud buzzer went off. Dougless slammed the door shut, then gave a weak smile of apology to the tour guide, whose quelling look made her feel like a child caught with her hand in a cookie jar.</p><p>\u201cBehave!\u201d Dougless hissed at him. \u201cIf you want to leave, I\u2019m ready.\u201d His actions were embarrassing, and she feared that he just might start telling the guide that he had built this house, and he had lived here.</p><p>But Nicholas didn\u2019t want to leave. He followed the guide through room after room, snorting now and then in derision, but saying nothing.</p><p>\u201cWe now come to our most popular room,\u201d the guide said, and by the little smile she gave, her audience knew something amusing was coming up.</p><p>Nicholas, being taller, saw into the room before Dougless did. \u201cWe will leave now,\u201d he said stiffly, but he said it in a way that made Dougless very much want to see what was in the room.</p><p>The guide began to speak. \u201cThis was Lord Nicholas Stafford\u2019s private chamber, and, to put it politely, Lord Nicholas was what is known as a rake. As you can see, he was a very handsome man.\u201d</p><p>When she heard that, Dougless pushed her way through the group to the front. There, hanging over the mantel, was a portrait of Lord Nicholas Stafford\u2014her Nicholas. He was dressed just as she\u2019d first seen him, wearing the beard and mustache she\u2019d first seen, and he was just as handsome then as he was now.</p><p>Of course he wasn\u2019t the same man, Dougless told herself, but she was willing to admit that the man she knew had to be a descendant.</p><p>The guide, smiling at what she felt was an amusing story, began to tell of Lord Nicholas\u2019s exploits with various ladies. \u201cIt was said that no woman could withstand his charm once he set his mind to have her, so his enemies were concerned that if he went to court, he might seduce the young and beautiful Queen Elizabeth.\u201d</p><p>Dougless felt Nicholas\u2019s fingers biting into her shoulder. \u201cI will take you to the treasure now,\u201d he whispered into her ear.</p><p>She put her fingers to her lips for him to be quiet.</p><p>\u201cIn 1560,\u201d the guide said, \u201cthere was a great scandal concerning Lady Arabella Sydney.\u201d The guide paused.</p><p>\u201cI wish to go now,\u201d Nicholas said emphatically into her ear.</p><p>Dougless waved him away.</p><p>The guide continued. \u201cIt was said at the time that Lady Sydney\u2019s fourth child was fathered by Lord Nicholas, who was some years younger than she. It was also said\u201d\u2014the guide\u2019s voice lowered conspiratorily\u2014\u201cthat the child was fathered on that table.\u201d</p><p>There was a combined intake of breath as everyone looked at an oak trestle table standing against the wall.</p><p>\u201cFurthermore,\u201d the guide said, \u201cLord Nicholas\u2014\u201d</p><p>From the back of the room came a very loud buzzer. It went on then off, on then off, making it impossible for the guide to continue speaking.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind!\u201d the guide said, but the buzzer kept going on and off.</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t have to look to see who was opening and closing the alarmed door\u2014or why he was doing it. Quickly, she began to make her way to the back of the group.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave,\u201d the guide said sternly, looking over the heads of the tourists to the back of the group. \u201cYou may go out the way you came.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grabbing Nicholas\u2019s arm, Dougless pulled him away from the buzzing door and back through two rooms.</p><p>\u201cWhat trivial knowledge is remembered through these hundreds of years,\u201d Nicholas said in anger.</p><p>She looked up at him with interest. \u201cIs it true?\u201d she asked. \u201cAbout Lady Arabella? About the table?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cNay, madam, such did not happen on that table.\u201d Turning, he walked away.</p> <p>Smiling, Dougless was relieved that the story wasn\u2019t true\u2014not that it mattered, but still . . .</p><p>\u201cI gave the true table to Arabella,\u201d he said over his shoulder.</p><p>Dougless gasped as she watched him walk away, but she hurriedly followed him. \u201cYou impregnated\u2014\u201d she began, but when he halted and looked down his nose at her, she stopped speaking. He had a way of looking at a person that could make you believe he was an aristocrat.</p><p>\u201cWe will see if these sottish people have violated my cabinet,\u201d he said, again turning away from her.</p><p>Dougless had to run to cover the distance his long legs were eating up. \u201cYou can\u2019t go in there,\u201d she said as he put his hand on a door that had a NO ADMITTANCE sign on it. Ignoring her, Nicholas pulled on the latch. For a moment, Dougless closed her eyes and held her breath, waiting for a buzzer to go off. When there was no sound, tentatively, she opened her eyes and saw that Nicholas had disappeared behind the door. With a quick look around to see if anyone was watching, she followed him, expecting to walk into a room full of secretaries.</p> <p>But there were no secretaries in the room, nor any people at all. There were just boxes stacked to the ceiling, and from what was printed on the sides, they looked to be full of paper napkins and other items for the tearoom. Behind the boxes was beautiful paneling that Dougless thought was a shame to hide.</p><p>She caught sight of Nicholas as he opened another door, so she ran after him. She followed him through three more rooms and got to see the difference between restored and unrestored. The rooms not open to the public had broken fireplaces, missing paneling, and painted ceilings spoiled by a leaky roof. In one room some Victorian had put wallpaper over the carved oak panels, and Dougless could see where workmen were painstakingly removing it.</p><p>At last Nicholas led her to a small room off a larger one. Here the ceiling had leaked until the plaster was a dirty brown, and the wide floorboards looked to be dangerously rotten. Standing in the doorway, she saw Nicholas looking about the room, sadness in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThis was my brother\u2019s chamber, and I was here but a fortnight ago,\u201d he said softly, then shrugged as though to block the regret from his mind. He walked across the rotten boards, went to a section of the paneling, and pushed at it. Nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cThe lock has rusted,\u201d he said, \u201cor someone has sealed it shut.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to become enraged and began hammering on the paneling with both fists.</p> <p>Mindless of the disintegrating floor, Dougless ran to him, and not knowing what else to do, she put her arms around him, pulled his head to her shoulder, and stroked his hair. \u201cSssh,\u201d she whispered as she would to a child. \u201cQuiet.\u201d</p><p>He clung to her, held her so tightly she could barely breathe. \u201cIt was my intent to be remembered for my learning,\u201d he said against her neck, and there were tears in his voice. \u201cI commissioned monks to copy hundreds of books. I began building Thornwyck. I have . . . Had. It is done now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSssh,\u201d Dougless soothed, holding his broad shoulders.</p><p>He pushed away from her and turned his back, but Dougless saw him wipe away tears. \u201cThey remember a moment on a table with Arabella,\u201d he said.</p><p>When he looked back at her, his face was fierce. \u201cIf I had lived . . .\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had but lived, I would have changed all. I must find out what my mother knew. She believed she had knowledge that would clear my name and save me from execution. And once I know this, I must return. I must change what is now said about me and about my family.\u201d</p><p>As Dougless looked at him, it was at that moment that she knew he was telling the truth. It was the way she, too, felt about her family. She didn\u2019t want to be remembered for all the idiot things she\u2019d done. She wanted to be remembered for her good deeds. Last summer, she\u2019d volunteered to help children who couldn\u2019t read. For four summers in a row she\u2019d spent three days a week at a shelter where she worked with children who, for the most part, had had very little kindness in their lives.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find out,\u201d she said softly. \u201cIf the information still exists today, we\u2019ll find it, and when we have the information, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be sent back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how to do this?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. But maybe it\u2019ll just happen once you know what you were sent here to find out.\u201d</p><p>He was frowning, but, slowly, his frown changed to a smile. \u201cYou have changed. You are looking at me in a different way. Do you not tell me I am lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cNo one could act this well.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to think about what she was saying. A sixteenth-century man could not come forward in time, but . . . but it had happened.</p><p>\u201cLook at this,\u201d she said as she touched the section of paneling he had been pounding. A little door stood open about an inch.</p><p>Nicholas pulled the door open. \u201cMy father told only my brother of this hidden cabinet, and Kit showed me but a week before he died. I told no one. The secret of its existence died with me.\u201d</p><p>As she watched, he stuck his hand in the hole and pulled out a roll of yellowed, brittle papers.</p><p>Nicholas looked at the papers in disbelief. \u201cI but put these in here a few days ago. They were new-made then.\u201d</p><p>Taking the papers from him, she unrolled them a bit. They were covered top to bottom, side to side, no margins, with writing that was incomprehensible to her.</p><p>\u201cAh, here is your treasure.\u201d He showed Dougless a small yellow white box, beautifully carved with figures of people and animals.</p><p>\u201cThis is ivory?\u201d she asked in wonder as she handed him the papers, then took the box. She had seen boxes like this one in museums, but she\u2019d never touched one. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, and it\u2019s a wonderful treasure.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas laughed. \u201cThe box is not the treasure. That lies inside. But wait,\u201d he said as Dougless began to open the lid. \u201cI find I am greatly in need of sustenance.\u201d He shoved the papers back into the cabinet as though he never wanted to see them again. Then he took the box from her, opened the tote bag she\u2019d purchased, and slipped the box inside.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make me wait until after you\u2019ve eaten before I can see what\u2019s inside that box?\u201d She was incredulous.</p><p>Nicholas laughed. \u201cIt pleases me to see that the nature of woman has not changed these four hundred years.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a smug look. \u201cDon\u2019t get too smart, or did you forget that I have your return train ticket?\u201d</p><p>She thought she had bested him, but as she watched, his face changed to softness, and he looked at her through his lashes in a way that made Dougless\u2019s heart beat a little faster. He stepped forward; she stepped back.</p><p>\u201cYou have heard,\u201d he said, his voice low, \u201cthat no woman can withstand me.\u201d</p><p>Dougless was backed against the wall, her heart pounding in her ears as he looked down at her. Putting his fingertips under her chin, he gently lifted her face upward. Was he going to kiss her? she wondered, half in outrage and half in anticipation. Anticipation won out; she closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI shall seduce my way back to the hotel,\u201d he said in a different tone that made Dougless know he\u2019d been teasing her\u2014and he\u2019d known exactly how his warm looks would affect her.</p><p>When her eyes flew open and she straightened up, he chucked her under the chin as a father might do\u2014or as the gorgeous private eye might do to his soppy secretary.</p><p>\u201cAh, but mayhap I could not seduce a woman of today. You have told me that women now are not as they were in my day,\u201d he said, shutting the little secret door. \u201cAlas, this is the day of women\u2019s . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLib,\u201d she answered. \u201cLiberation.\u201d She was thinking about Lady Arabella on the table.</p><p>He looked back at her. \u201cI am sure I would not be able to charm a woman such as you. You have told me that you love . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobert. Yes, I do,\u201d Dougless said firmly. \u201cMaybe when I get back to the States, he and I can work things out. Or maybe when he gets my message about the bracelet, he\u2019ll come for me.\u201d She wanted to remember Robert. Compared to this man, Robert seemed safe.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Nicholas said, starting for the door, Dougless inches behind him.</p><p>\u201cJust what is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more, no less.\u201d</p><p>She blocked him from leaving the room. \u201cIf you want to say something, say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis Robert will come for jewels but not for the woman he loves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s coming for me!\u201d she snapped. \u201cThe bracelet is . . . It\u2019s just that Gloria is a brat and she lied, but she\u2019s his daughter so of course Robert believed her. And stop looking at me like that! Robert is a fine man. At least he\u2019ll be remembered for what he did on an operating table instead of on a\u2014\u201d She stopped at the look on Nicholas\u2019s face.</p><p>Turning, he strode ahead of her.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, running after him. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it. I was just angry, that\u2019s all. It\u2019s not your fault you\u2019re remembered for Arabella; it\u2019s our fault. We see too much TV, read too much National Enquirer. Our lives are filled with too much sensationalism. Colin, please.\u201d She stopped where she was. Was he going to walk away and leave her too?</p><p>Her head was down, so she wasn\u2019t aware that he\u2019d walked back to her. Companionably, he put his arm around her shoulders. \u201cDo they sell ice cream in this place?\u201d</p><p>When she smiled at that, he tipped her chin up and wiped away a single tear. \u201cAre you onion-eyed again?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She shook her head, afraid to trust her voice.</p><p>\u201cThen come,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I remember rightly, there is a pearl in that box as big as my thumb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked. She had forgotten all about the box. \u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea first,\u201d he said. \u201cTea and scones and ice cream. Then I shall show you the box.\u201d</p><p>They walked together out of the unrestored rooms, past the next tour, and out the In, which the guides did not like at all.</p><p>In the tea shop, this time, Nicholas took over. Dougless sat at a table and waited for him as he talked to a woman behind the counter. The woman was shaking her head about something Nicholas was asking, but Dougless had an idea that he\u2019d get whatever it was that he wanted.</p><p>Minutes later, he motioned for her to come with him. He led her outside, then down stone stairs, across an acre of garden, to at last stop under the dappled shade of a yew tree with bright red berries. When Dougless turned around, she saw a woman and a man carrying two large trays filled with tea, pastries, little sandwiches with no crusts, and Nicholas\u2019s beloved scones.</p><p>Nicholas ignored the two people as they spread a cloth on the ground and set out the tea things. \u201cThere was my knot garden,\u201d he said, pointing, his voice heavy with sadness. \u201cAnd there was a mound.\u201d</p><p>After the people left, Nicholas held out his hand to help her sit on the cloth. She poured his tea, added milk, filled a plate full of food for him, then said, \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Dougless dove into the tote bag and pulled out the old, fragile ivory box, then slowly, with breath held, opened it.</p><p>Inside were two rings of exquisite loveliness, one an emerald, one a ruby, the gold mountings cast into intricate forms of dragons and snakes. Nicholas took the rings and, smiling at her, slipped them onto his fingers, where, she wasn\u2019t surprised to see, they fit perfectly.</p><p>On the bottom of the box was a bit of old, cracked velvet, and she could see that it was wrapped around something. Gingerly, Dougless removed the velvet and slowly opened it.</p><p>In her hand lay a brooch, oval, with little gold figures of . . . She looked up at Nicholas. \u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the martyrdom of Saint Barbara,\u201d he said, his tone implying that she knew nothing.</p><p>Dougless had guessed it was a martyrdom because it looked as if the gold man was about to cut off the head of the tiny gold woman. Encircling the figures was an abstract enamel design, and around the edges were tiny pearls and diamonds. Hanging from a loop below the brooch was indeed a pearl as large as a man\u2019s thumb. It was a baroque pearl, indented, even lumpy, but with a luster that no years could dim.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt is yours,\u201d Nicholas said.</p><p>A wave of avarice shot through Dougless. \u201cI cannot,\u201d she said, even as her hand closed over the jewel.</p><p>Nicholas laughed. \u201cIt is a woman\u2019s bauble. You may keep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s too valuable. This pin is worth too much and it\u2019s too old. It should be in a museum. It should\u2014\u201d</p><p>Taking the jewel from her hand, he pinned it between the collar points of her blouse.</p><p>Dougless took her compact from her purse, opened the mirror, and looked at the brooch. She also looked at her face. \u201cI have to go to the rest room,\u201d she said, making Nicholas laugh as she rose.</p><p>Alone in the rest room, she had some time to really look at the pin, and only left when someone else entered. On her way back to Nicholas, she couldn\u2019t resist slipping into the gift shop to look at the postcards. It took her a moment to see what Nicholas had not wanted her to see. There, on the bottom of a rack, was a postcard of a portrait of the notorious Lady Arabella. Dougless took one.</p><p>As she was paying, Dougless asked the cashier if there was anything in any of the books for sale about Nicholas Stafford.</p><p>The woman smiled in a patronizing way. \u201cAll the young ladies ask after him. We usually have cards of his portrait, but we\u2019re out right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing written about him? About his accomplishments other than . . . than with women?\u201d Dougless asked.</p><p>Again there was that little smirk. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Lord Nicholas accomplished anything. The only thing of importance that he did was to raise an army against the queen, and he was sentenced to be executed for that. If he hadn\u2019t died beforehand, he would have been beheaded. He was quite a scoundrel of a young man.\u201d</p><p>Dougless took the single postcard and started to leave, but she turned back. \u201cWhat happened to Lord Nicholas\u2019s mother after he died?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The woman brightened. \u201cLady Margaret? Now there was a grand lady. Let me see, I believe she married again. What was his name? Oh, yes, Harewood. She married Lord Richard Harewood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know if she left any papers behind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my, no, I have no idea of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the Stafford papers are at Goshawk Hall,\u201d came a voice from the door. It was the guide whose tour she and Nicholas had so rudely interrupted.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is Goshawk Hall?\u201d Dougless asked, feeling embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cNear the village of Thornwyck,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>\u201cThornwyck,\u201d Dougless said, and nearly gave a whoop of joy, but caught herself. It was all she could do to thank the women before she ran from the shop into the garden. Nicholas lay stretched out on the cloth, sipping tea and finishing the scones.</p><p>\u201cYour mother married Richard, ah . . . Harewood,\u201d she said breathlessly, \u201cand all the papers are at . . .\u201d She couldn\u2019t remember the name.</p><p>\u201cGoshawk Hall?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s it! It\u2019s near Thornwyck.\u201d</p><p>He turned away from her. \u201cMy mother married Harewood?\u201d</p><p>Dougless watched the back of him. If he\u2019d died accused of treason, had his mother, in her poverty, been forced to marry some despicable despot? Had his old, frail mother been forced to endure some man who treated her as no more than property?</p><p>When Nicholas\u2019s shoulders began to shake, Dougless put her hand on his arm. \u201cNicholas, it\u2019s not your fault. You were dead, you couldn\u2019t help her.\u201d What am I saying? she thought.</p><p>But when Nicholas turned around, she saw that he was . . . laughing. \u201cI should have known she would land on her feet,\u201d he said. \u201cHarewood! She married Dickie Harewood.\u201d He could hardly speak for laughing so hard.</p><p>\u201cTell me everything,\u201d Dougless urged, eyes alight.</p> <p>\u201cDickie Harewood is a tardy-gaited, unhaired pajock.\u201d</p><p>Dougless frowned, not understanding.</p><p>\u201cAn ass, madam,\u201d Nicholas explained. \u201cBut a rich one. Aye, he\u2019s very rich.\u201d He leaned back, smiling. \u201cIt is good to know she was not left one-trunk-inheriting.\u201d</p><p>Still smiling, he poured Dougless a cup of tea, and as she took it, he picked up her little paper bag and opened it.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d she began, but he was already looking at the postcard of Lady Arabella\u2019s portrait.</p><p>He looked up at her with such a knowing look that she wanted to dump the tea over his head. \u201cDid they not have a picture of the table too?\u201d he mocked.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you mean,\u201d she said haughtily, not looking at his face as she snatched the card out of his hands and put it back into the bag. \u201cThe picture is for research. It might help us . . .\u201d For the life of her, she couldn\u2019t think what a picture of the mother of Nicholas\u2019s illegitimate child could possibly help them find out. \u201cDid you eat all the scones? You really can be a pig sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas gave a snort of laughter.</p> <p>After a moment he said, \u201cWhat say you we stay in this town this night? On the morrow I shall purchase Armant and Rafe.\u201d</p><p>It took Dougless a moment to understand what he meant, but then she remembered the American magazines he\u2019d seen. \u201cGeorgio Armani and Ralph Lauren?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cClothing of your time. When I return to my house in Thornwyck, I will not be one-trunk-inheriting either.\u201d</p><p>Dougless bit into a little sandwich. Unless she found Robert and got her suitcases back soon, she was going to have to buy more clothes too.</p><p>She looked at Nicholas, his hands behind his head. Tomorrow they\u2019d go shopping, then the next day they\u2019d go to Thornwyck, where they\u2019d try to find out who had betrayed him to the queen.</p><p>But tonight, she thought. Tonight they\u2019d once again spend alone in a hotel room.</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>Dougless sat in the back of the big black taxi, luggage all around her. This is where I came in, she thought, remembering being in the back of Robert\u2019s rental car and trying to get comfortable around Gloria\u2019s luggage. But now, sprawled beside her, his long legs stretched out, was Nicholas. He was absorbed in a battery-powered video game that they\u2019d purchased this morning.</p><p>Putting her head back, Dougless closed her eyes and thought about the last several hours. After tea at Bellwood yesterday, she had called a taxi and asked to be taken to a nice hotel in Bath. The driver had taken them to a lovely eighteenth-century building where she was able to get a double room for the night. Neither she nor Nicholas mentioned asking for separate rooms. It was a beautiful room done in yellow chintz and flowered wallpaper, with white bedspreads piped in yellow on the two beds. Nicholas ran his hand over the wallpaper and vowed that when he got home, he was going to have someone paint the walls of his house with lilies and roses.</p><p>After they checked in, they went walking to look in the windows of the wonderful shops in Bath. It was near dinnertime when Dougless saw a movie house called the American Cinema.</p><p>\u201cWe could always go to a movie and eat hot dogs and popcorn for dinner,\u201d she said, making a joke.</p><p>But Nicholas had been so intrigued that he\u2019d started asking questions, so Dougless bought tickets. She thought it was a bit ironic that an \u201cAmerican\u201d Cinema was playing an English movie\u2014Room With a View\u2014but they did have American hot dogs, popcorn, Cokes, and Reese\u2019s peanut butter cups. Knowing Nicholas\u2019s appetite, Dougless bought so much of everything that they could hardly waddle down the aisle for the load they were carrying.</p><p>Nicholas loved the popcorn, choked on the Coke, thought the hot dog had possibilities, and nearly cried in delight over the peanut butter and chocolate. Before the movie started, Dougless tried to explain what a movie was, and how very large the people would look. But Nicholas was too interested in what was going on in his mouth to listen very carefully.</p><p>He was fascinated when the lights went down, then nearly jumped out of his seat when the music came on. At the first sight of the enormous people, the expression on his face was so horrified that Dougless nearly dropped her popcorn.</p><p>Throughout the film, watching Nicholas was much more interesting than watching the movie\u2014which Dougless had already seen twice before anyway.</p><p>As they walked back to the hotel after the film was over, he was full of questions. He\u2019d been so enamored with the technical aspect of the movie that he could hardly follow the story. Also, he couldn\u2019t understand the clothes. It took some explaining to make him understand that Edwardian was \u201cold.\u201d</p><p>In the hotel, they shared the toiletries Dougless had in her handbag, and what was in the little basket in the hotel. Dougless meant to sleep in her underwear so, after a shower, she wrapped herself in the robe supplied by the hotel. She\u2019d planned to go straight to bed, but Nicholas wanted her to read to him, so she took her Agatha Christie from her bag, sat on a chair by him, and read until he fell asleep.</p><p>Before she turned out the light, she stood over him for a moment, looking down at his soft black hair against the crisp white sheets. On impulse, she lightly kissed his forehead. \u201cGood night, my prince,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Without opening his eyes, Nicholas clasped her fingers. \u201cI am but a mere earl,\u201d he said softly, not opening his eyes, \u201cbut my thankings for the tribute.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassed but smiling, she pulled away from him and went to her own bed. But, tired as she was, she lay awake for a long while, listening carefully for any sounds from him, wondering if he\u2019d have bad dreams as he had the night before. But when he was silent, she at last drifted off. When she awoke, it was morning and he was already up and in the bathroom. Her first feeling was one of disappointment that she\u2019d not slept cuddled in his arms, but she reprimanded herself. She was in love with Robert, wasn\u2019t she? She couldn\u2019t be so frivolous as to have fallen out of love in just a few days, could she? Not over one argument?</p><p>And she couldn\u2019t possibly imagine herself to be in love with a man who was not and never could be hers, could she? She could never love a man who at any minute could go up in a puff of smoke and leave as quickly as he had arrived. Could she?</p><p>Nicholas came out of the bathroom, barefoot and barechested, wearing only his trousers, and toweling his wet hair. There were much worse sights in the morning than the broad, nude chest of a beautiful man, she thought. Dougless lay back against the pillows and sighed.</p><p>At her sigh, Nicholas looked at her and frowned. \u201cDo you waste the day? We must find me a barber to shave this,\u201d he said as he ran his hand over the growing whiskers.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite fashionable now to have black stubble. Movie stars go to formal ceremonies with five o\u2019clock shadow,\u201d she said. But Nicholas didn\u2019t like that idea. He said it was a beard or bare and \u201cnaught between.\u201d In the end, she used the razor and tiny can of lather furnished by the hotel to show him how to shave. Unfortunately, before she could stop him, he ran his fingertips over the blade of the razor and sliced them. He laughed at Dougless for the to-do she made over such a little cut.</p><p>Later, dressed, fortified with a hearty English breakfast, they went shopping. Dougless was becoming accustomed to helping Nicholas do the most ordinary of things, but, this time, when he shopped for clothes, he knew exactly what he wanted. Dougless was amazed at how much he\u2019d learned from an evening of looking at fashion magazines.</p><p>This time in an exclusive shop, Nicholas the earl took over, while Dougless merely stood in the background and watched. The English clerks seemed to recognize that they were dealing with aristocracy because it was \u201cYes, sir\u201d and \u201cNo, sir\u201d to him right and left.</p><p>Now, in the taxi, around Dougless\u2019s feet were piled shopping bags filled with shirts, trousers, socks, belts, a marvelous coat of waxed cloth, caps, two Italian silk jackets, a luscious leather jacket, ties, and even a full set of evening clothes. It was as they were leaving the fifth store that Dougless had begun making moans of fatigue, especially now that they had several heavy bags to carry. Nicholas had given her a look of disdain, as though she were a real wimp. A moment later he gave a piercing whistle and a taxi stopped. He learns quickly, Dougless thought. Without her help, Nicholas arranged for the taxi to follow them for the rest of the morning as he purchased more clothes. Dougless paid for them while the driver hauled the bags out to the taxi.</p><p>At one o\u2019clock she was wilted and ready to suggest lunch when he stopped before a lovely window display of women\u2019s clothes. He looked at the display, then at Dougless, then half-shoved her into the shop, ahead of him. It was truly amazing how her energy revived! Nicholas was as generous as he was good at choosing clothing. He sent three young women clerks scurrying as he demanded that he be shown the best they had to offer. Dougless spent an hour and a half in the dressing room in her underwear, pulling clothes on and off. When they left, three bags full of new clothes for her were added to what Nicholas had bought for himself.</p><p>Finally, the only clothing he still needed was shoes. Nicholas had come to enjoy the comfort of modern clothes, but he hated the hard leather of modern shoes. The shoes he liked best were soft leather bedroom slippers. After three stores Dougless persuaded him to purchase two pairs of Italian shoes that were frightfully expensive. He told Dougless she must buy new shoes also, but when he pulled four pair\u2014dress boots, pumps, walking shoes, and loafers\u2014off the shelves, she said he\u2019d already spent too much on her. Nicholas threatened to wear the terry cloth bedroom slippers from the hotel unless she purchased all four. Laughing, she agreed.</p><p>They made one last stop to buy luggage to pack everything into. Nicholas wanted leather luggage, but as there was little money left, Dougless talked him into some blue canvas bags with belting leather trim.</p><p>By the time they were done shopping, it was three P.M. and all the lunch shops were closed. They purchased bread and cheese, meat pies, and a bottle of wine, then ate in the back of the taxi as it drove them back to the bed-and-breakfast in Ashburton. And since eating while traveling went against Nicholas\u2019s aristocratic ideas of etiquette, she\u2019d had to talk him into it. But she couldn\u2019t move him about the train. Dougless had said they should take the train back, as it was much cheaper than a taxi. But Nicholas had scoffed at her idea that he handle luggage, so they were being driven all the way back to the hotel.</p><p>On the return trip Nicholas got his first sight of the six-lane English motorways. She didn\u2019t know how he felt about the speed of the cars around him, but it terrified her. The slow lane traveled at seventy miles per hour, so she couldn\u2019t imagine what the fast, outside lane was doing.</p><p>After a while, Nicholas stopped staring at the trucks and asking questions about everything he saw, and settled back against the seat to play with the little video game she\u2019d run into Boots and bought for him. As she watched him, she thought of all the many things in the world there were for him to see and do yet. There were VCRs, TVs, Ferris wheels, airplanes, space rockets. There was all of America: Maine with its boats; the South, which would have to be experienced to be believed; the Southwest with its cowboy heritage and the Native Americans; and there was California with . . . Smiling, she thought of Hollywood and Venice Beach. She could take him to the Pacific Northwest for salmon, to ski in Colorado, to a roundup in Texas. She could\u2014</p><p>They arrived back at their little bed-and-breakfast before she could think of all the things she\u2019d like to show him, and before she reminded herself that he was only temporarily with her. But if he really was her Knight in Shining Armor, maybe he wouldn\u2019t return.</p><p>Nicholas directed the taxi driver in removing the many bags from the vehicle and setting them in the entryway, while Dougless started to pay the driver with the last of the money from the sale of the coins. While she was figuring out the tip, the landlady came hurrying down the steps.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been here all day, miss,\u201d Mrs. Beasley said excitedly. \u201cHe came this morning and hasn\u2019t left since. He\u2019s in an awful mood, and he\u2019s said some terrible things. I thought you and Mr. Stafford were married,\u201d she said, reproach in her voice.</p><p>Dougless knew, of course, who \u201che\u201d was. Besides Nicholas, there was only one \u201che\u201d in England who knew where she was\u2014or where she\u2019d been left, that is. So now was her chance to sort out things with Robert. This is what she\u2019d wanted. Why, then, was her stomach starting to hurt? She suddenly remembered the pills the doctor had prescribed for her stomach. She hadn\u2019t needed any in days. \u201cWho is here?\u201d she asked softly, biding for time.</p><p>\u201cRobert Whitley,\u201d the landlady said.</p><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s a young lady with him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dougless nodded and, with her stomach hurting more with each step, she went up the stairs to the entryway. Nicholas was busy ordering the taxi driver about, but he stopped when he saw Dougless\u2019s face. Calmly, she paid the driver, saying not a word; then she went into the parlor, where Robert and Gloria were waiting for her.</p><p>Gloria was seated on a chair, her face angry, but Dougless ignored the girl. Instead, she looked at Robert, who was standing in front of the window. She couldn\u2019t see any remorse on his face.</p><p>\u201cAt last,\u201d Robert said when Dougless entered. \u201cWe have been waiting the entire day. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>She knew what he meant, but she refused to let him know she did. Hadn\u2019t he missed her at all? \u201cWhere is what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe bracelet you stole!\u201d Gloria said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you pushed me down in that graveyard, so you could take my bracelet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did no such thing,\u201d Dougless said. \u201cYou fell against the\u2014\u201d</p><p>Moving to stand beside her, Robert put his arm around Dougless. \u201cLook,\u201d he said as he smiled at her, \u201cwe didn\u2019t come here to quarrel. Gloria and I have missed you.\u201d He gave a little laugh. \u201cOh, you should see us. We get lost every few minutes. Neither one of us is good with a road map and we can\u2019t figure out the hotels at all. You were always so good at figuring out schedules and whether a hotel had room service or not.\u201d</p><p>Dougless wasn\u2019t sure whether to feel elated or dejected. He wanted her, but only to read the road maps and to order room service for the two of them.</p><p>Robert gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t steal the bracelet. That was something that was said in the heat of the moment. But it was certainly lucky that you found it.\u201d</p> <p>When Gloria started to speak, Robert gave her a look to be quiet, and that look made Dougless feel better. Maybe he was going to force his daughter to show her some respect. Maybe\u2014</p><p>\u201cPlease, Lessa,\u201d Robert said, nuzzling her ear, \u201cplease come back with us. You can sit in the front half the time, and Gloria half the time. That\u2019s fair, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what to do. Robert was being so nice, and it was wonderful to hear his apology, and to think that he needed her.</p><p>\u201cWell, madam,\u201d Nicholas said, striding into the room, \u201cdo you mean to unkiss our bargain?\u201d</p><p>Robert jumped away from Dougless, and immediately she was aware of hatred coming from him\u2014a hatred that was directed toward Nicholas. Was Robert jealous? she wondered. Never before had he shown any signs of jealousy. And, as for Nicholas, he was staring at Robert with wide eyes, as though he were staring at an apparition. It took both men a few minutes to recover themselves.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d Robert asked.</p> <p>\u201cWell, madam?\u201d Nicholas asked.</p><p>As Dougless looked from one man to the other, she felt like running from the room and never seeing either of them again.</p><p>\u201cWho is this?\u201d Robert demanded. \u201cHave you obtained a . . . a lover in the few days since you left us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeft you?\u201d Dougless said. \u201cYou left me, and you took my handbag with you! You left me without money or credit cards or\u2014\u201d</p><p>Robert waved his hand in dismissal. \u201cThat was all a mistake. Gloria picked up your bag for you. She thought she was helping you. Neither of us had any idea that you\u2019d decide to remain here, or that you\u2019d refuse to travel with us. Isn\u2019t that right, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelping me?\u201d Dougless gasped, so overwhelmed with his twisting of the truth that she could hardly speak. \u201cI decided to remain here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDougless,\u201d Robert said, \u201cdo we have to discuss our private problems in front of this stranger? We have your luggage in the car, so I suggest that we leave here now.\u201d Firmly taking her arm, he started to lead her away.</p><p>But Nicholas stood in the doorway, blocking their way. \u201cDo you mean to leave me?\u201d he asked as he looked down at Dougless, anger in his voice. \u201cDo you mean to go with this man who wants you for the service you do him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI . . . I . . .\u201d Dougless said, feeling confused. On the one hand, Robert was being a jerk, but at least he was real. For all the romance that surrounded this Nicholas Stafford, if he found what he was looking for, he\u2019d be gone in a second. Besides, both men wanted her for what she could do for them. Robert wanted her to read road maps; Nicholas wanted her to help him research.</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t know what she should do.</p><p>Nicholas decided for her. \u201cThis woman has been hired by me,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil I have done with her services, she will remain with me.\u201d At that he clamped his hand on Robert\u2019s shoulder and pushed him toward the door.</p><p>\u201cGet your hands off of me!\u201d Robert shouted. \u201cYou can\u2019t treat me like this, I\u2019ll have the police on you. Gloria, call the police! Dougless, either you come with me now or you\u2019ll never get a marriage proposal out of me. You\u2019ll never\u2014\u201d His last words were cut off as Nicholas shut the door behind him.</p><p>Dougless sat on the nearest chair, her head down.</p><p>When Nicholas returned, he took one look at Gloria and said, \u201cOut!\u201d</p><p>Gloria ran for the doorway, then pounded down the front stairs.</p><p>Nicholas went to the window and looked out. \u201cThey are gone now, but they have left your capcases on the ground. We are well rid of them.\u201d</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t look up. How did she get herself in these messes? She couldn\u2019t even go away on a vacation without something awful happening to her. Why couldn\u2019t she have a normal, ordinary relationship with a man? She\u2019d meet a man in a classroom somewhere, he\u2019d ask her out, then they\u2019d go on simple dates to movies or to play miniature golf. After a few dates, he\u2019d propose marriage over a bottle of wine. They\u2019d have a nice wedding, a nice house, two nice kids. Her whole life would be simple and ordinary.</p><p>Instead, she met guys who had been in jail or were about to be taken off to jail, guys who were ruled by their obnoxious daughters, or men who were from the sixteenth century. Honestly, she didn\u2019t know any other woman who\u2019d ever had as much trouble with men as she\u2019d had.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with me?\u201d she whispered, burying her face in her hands.</p><p>Kneeling before her, Nicholas pulled her hands away from her face. \u201cI find I am most tired. Mayhap you will come upstairs and read to me so I may rest.\u201d</p><p>Like a dumb animal, she let Nicholas take her hand and lead her upstairs. But once upstairs, he didn\u2019t expect her to read to him. Instead he told her to stretch out on the bed, which she did, while he sat beside her on the bed and began to sing to her. He sang a soft, sweet lullaby that she doubted anyone else in this century had ever heard before. Gradually, she drifted off into sleep.</p><p>NINE</p><p>When she was asleep, Nicholas leaned back against the headboard and stroked her hair. God, but how much he wanted to touch her! He wanted to put his hands in her thick hair of that glorious dark red. He wanted to run his hands over her pale skin, wanted to feel those legs of hers wrapped around him. He wanted to kiss away her tears, then kiss her mouth. He wanted to kiss her all over until she smiled and laughed and was happy.</p><p>She slept bonelessly, like a child, but there was a catch in her breathing as though she\u2019d been weeping. He\u2019d never seen a woman cry as often as she did, he thought. But then, he\u2019d never seen any woman who was like her. She wanted love so very much.</p><p>He had asked her about marriage in this strange new world, and the answers did not please him. In his mind, marriage should be a contract, something made as an alliance, made to breed a suitable heir. But it seemed that in this new century marriage partners chose each other for love.</p><p>Love! Nicholas thought. The emotion was a waste of a man\u2019s energy. Too many times he had seen men who\u2019d lost all because of the \u201clove\u201d of some woman.</p><p>He touched Dougless\u2019s temple, stroked the soft hair there, and looked down at her beautiful body of full br**sts and slim legs. Look what this girl had suffered for \u201clove,\u201d he thought. With a smile, Nicholas thought of what his mother would have said to the idea of marrying for love. Lady Margaret Stafford had had four husbands, and she\u2019d never considered loving any of them.</p><p>But as Nicholas looked down at this modern woman, he felt a softness inside him that he\u2019d never felt before. She wore her heart on the outside of her body, ready to give it to anyone who was kind to her. As far as he could tell, she had no ulterior motives for the help she gave, for the warmth she gave. She didn\u2019t ask for money. Nor did she try to take advantage of his constant confusion in this century. No, she gave help because someone needed her help.</p><p>He put his hand to her cheek, and in her sleep, she snuggled her face against his hand.</p><p>What bond had brought them together? And what bond held them? He had not told her, as she did not seem to experience it, but he could feel her pain. From the first day, when she felt pain, so did he. That first day, outside the church, she had made what he now knew was a telephone call to her sister. He\u2019d had no idea what she was doing, but he\u2019d sensed that she was hurt.</p><p>Today, he\u2019d been directing the driver with the bags when, suddenly, he had sensed a feeling of great despair, and he knew it was coming from her. His first sight of the lover who had abandoned her was such a shock to him that he\u2019d had difficulty understanding the words.</p><p>At first his only thought had been that Dougless was going to leave him. How would he find the key to returning if she left him? But more than that, what would he do without her? Without her smiles and teasings? Without her innocence and her laughter?</p><p>It was still difficult for him to understand the modern speech, but he understood that her ex-lover wanted her to go with him, and he could see that Dougless was having difficulty deciding what to do. When Nicholas threw the man out, he had reacted out of a primitive instinct. How could Dougless consider leaving with a man who gave his daughter precedence over a woman? If for no other reason, Dougless deserved respect because she was older. What manner of country was this that worshiped children to the extent that they were treated as royalty?</p><p>Now, as she lay beside him, Nicholas touched her shoulder, then ran his hand down Dougless\u2019s arm. Three days, he thought. Three days ago he had never seen her before, but now he found himself doing whatever he could to make her smile. She was so easy to please. All it took was a kind word, a gift, or even a smile.</p><p>Leaning over her, he softly kissed her hair. The woman needed caring for, he thought. She needed someone to watch over her. She was like a rosebud that needed a little sunshine to make it open into a full blossom. She needed . . .</p><p>Abruptly, Nicholas pulled away from her, then got off the bed and went to stand by the window. Her needs were not his concern, he told himself. Even if he could somehow take her back with him, he could do no more than make her his mistress. He gave a one-sided smile. He did not think the soft Dougless would make a very good mistress. She would never ask her master for a thing, and what she had she\u2019d give to any child who had no shoes.</p><p>Nicholas ran his hand over his eyes as though to clear his vision. There was more in this twentieth century that he did not understand than machines that produced light and pictures. He did not understand their philosophy. Yesterday he had seen an outrageous thing called a movie. It had taken him some time to be able to see it, as the people were so large, and the concept of flat giants who looked so round was difficult for him to understand. Dougless had told him the people were normal size, but, like a person could be drawn small, one could be photographed large. After he got over his horror of the pictures themselves, he found that he did not understand the story. A young girl was to marry a perfectly suitable man of means, but she had thrown him over for a penniless young man who had nothing more than a fine pair of legs.</p><p>Afterward, Dougless had told him she thought the story \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201cromantic.\u201d He did not understand this philosophy. If his mother had had a daughter and that daughter had refused to honor a good marriage contract, Lady Margaret would have beaten the girl until her arm grew tired; then his mother would have directed the strongest groom to beat the girl some more. But in this age it seemed that disobedience in children was to be encouraged.</p><p>He looked back at her, asleep on the bed, her knees tucked up, her hand under her face.</p><p>If he remained in this age, he thought, then perhaps he could remain with her. It would be pleasant to live with such a soft female, a woman who put his needs before her own, a woman who held him when his dreams were bad. A woman who did not want him because he was an earl or because he had money. Yes, life with her could be pleasant.</p><p>No! he thought, then turned away from her to look out the window. He thought back to that hideous beldame at Bellwood, that hag who had laughed at the memory of Nicholas Stafford. If he remained in this time with Dougless, he would never change how he was remembered. The woman at Bellwood had said that after Nicholas\u2019s death, Queen Elizabeth had taken the Stafford estates, and later most of them had been destroyed in the Civil War. Only four of his many estates now remained\u2014and none of them belonged to a Stafford.</p><p>Honor, Nicholas thought. People of this age seemed to think little of honor. Dougless did not really understand what he meant by honor. She thought the story of Lady Arabella was amusing. Even the idea of what a man\u2019s execution for treason did to his family did not bother her. \u201cIt was so long ago,\u201d she\u2019d said. \u201cWho rememberers what happened so many years ago?\u201d</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t long ago to Nicholas. To him, just three days ago he had been in the White Tower, trying to save his family\u2019s honor, and his own head as well.</p><p>This changing of time had happened to him for a reason. He was sure that God was giving him a second chance. He was convinced that somewhere in this century was the answer to who had hated him enough to want him killed. Who had benefitted by his death? And who so had the queen\u2019s ear that she would believe this person completely?</p><p>Nothing had come out at his trial. The facts were that he had raised an army, but he had not sought the queen\u2019s permission. Men had come from his estates in Wales to swear that they had requested the troops, but the judges would not listen to the men. The judges swore they had \u201csecret\u201d evidence. They said that they \u201cknew\u201d that Nicholas Stafford had been planning to overthrow the young Queen Elizabeth and return England to the Catholic religion.</p><p>When Nicholas had been condemned to death, he had believed that would be his fate. But his mother had sent a message saying that she had found new evidence and soon the truth would be known. Soon Nicholas would be a free man.</p><p>But before he could find out what the evidence was, he\u2019d \u201cdied.\u201d At least that is what history wrote of him. An ignoble death to be sure, he thought. He\u2019d been found slumped over an unfinished letter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why hadn\u2019t his mother brought the evidence forth after his death and cleared his name? Instead, she had relinquished all control over the Stafford estates and married a fat-brain like Dickie Harewood. Why? For money? Had she been left without even the estates she had inherited from her mother?</p><p>There were so many questions to be answered and so much injustice to correct. And there was so much honor at stake.</p><p>All Nicholas felt he knew for sure was that he had been called forward to this time to discover what he needed to know. And, for some fortuitous reason, he had been given this lovely young woman to assist him. Looking back at her, he smiled. Would he have been as generous as she if she had come to him and told him she was from the future? He thought not. He might have ordered the lighting of the fires that burned her as a witch.</p><p>But she had devoted all her time to him, reluctantly at first, but he had soon discovered that it was not in her nature to be ungenerous.</p> <p>And now, he thought with a sigh, she was falling in love with him. He could see it in her eyes. In his time, when a woman started to love him, he left her. Women who loved you were an annoyance. He much preferred women like Arabella who liked jewels or a fine piece of silk. He and Arabella understood each other. There was only sex between them.</p><p>But that was not the way with this Dougless. She would be one to give love, and to love with all her being. That man Robert had had some of her love, but, obviously, he was too stupid to know what to do with it. Nicholas could see that the man used Dougless, played with her love, and enjoyed his control over her.</p><p>Nicholas took a step toward her. If he, Nicholas, had her love, he would know what to do with it. He would\u2014</p><p>No! he told himself, then looked away. No, he could not let her love him. When he left this modern world, she would be overcome with grief. Nicholas would not like to return and think of her here alone, think of her loving a man who\u2019d been dead over four hundred years.</p><p>Therefore, he had to find a way to make her stop loving him. He couldn\u2019t feign anger and send her away because he needed her knowledge of this foreign world. But, at the same time, he couldn\u2019t bear to think of leaving her behind in misery. He had to find a way to stop her love, and it had to be a way she could understand, a way that related to her world, not his.</p> <p>Smiling at the absurdity of the idea, Nicholas thought that perhaps he could tell her he was in love with another woman. That usually set women off in any century. But who? Arabella? He almost laughed aloud when he thought of the postcard Dougless had bought. Perhaps a woman she\u2019d not heard of would be better. Alice? Elizabeth? Jane? Ah, dear little Jane.</p><p>He stopped smiling. What about Lettice?</p><p>In love with his wife?</p><p>Nicholas hadn\u2019t thought of that cold-eyed bitch in weeks. When he had been arrested for treason, Lettice had started looking for a new husband.</p><p>Could he make Dougless believe he was in love with his wife? That movie had shown people marrying for love. Perhaps if he told Dougless he wanted to go back because he loved his wife so much . . . He could not believe Dougless would consider love more important than honor, but this age was very strange to him.</p><p>Now all he had to do was find a place and time to tell her.</p> <p>He had made his decision, but it didn\u2019t make him feel better. Quietly, he left the room. He\u2019d go to the coin dealer and see about selling more of the coins. Tomorrow, they would go to Thornwyck Castle and start finding the answers to his questions.</p><p>With one last look at Dougless, he left the room.</p><p>Dougless awoke with a start, and when she saw she was alone, a sense of panic gripped her, but she calmed herself. Then the scene with Robert came back to her. Had she done the right thing? Should she have gone with him? After all, Robert did apologize\u2014sort of. He\u2019d explained why he\u2019d left her: he thought she was refusing to travel with him, and maybe Gloria had picked up her handbag innocently.</p><p>Dougless put her hands to her head. Everything was so confusing. What did she mean to Robert? To Nicholas? What did these men mean to her? Why had Nicholas come to her? Why not to someone else? Why not to someone who wasn\u2019t confused about everything in her life?</p><p>The door opened and Nicholas came in smiling. \u201cI have sold but a few of the coins and we are rich!\u201d he said.</p><p>Smiling back at him, she remembered the way he\u2019d pushed Robert out the door. Was this man her Knight in Shining Armor? Had he been sent to her because she just plain needed him so much?</p><p>Her look seemed to annoy Nicholas, for he turned away, frowning. \u201cShall we have supper?\u201d he asked.</p><p>As they walked through the village on their way to an Indian restaurant their landlady had recommended, they were both quiet, each thinking hard on their own thoughts. Once they were at the restaurant, Nicholas gave himself over to the food. He loved the flavors of the cumin, coriander, garam masala, and cinnamon all mixed together. As he ate, Dougless saw envious looks directed toward them from several women at nearby tables. Out of interest, and partly to keep him from looking at the women, she asked him what food they ate in 1564, and was it very different from food in the twentieth century?</p> <p>He talked, but Dougless didn\u2019t really listen. Instead, she looked at his eyes and his hair, and watched the way his hands moved. He wasn\u2019t going to leave this century, she thought. She\u2019d wished him forward and he\u2019d come to her. She knew enough about him to know that he was the man she\u2019d always wanted: kind, thoughtful, funny, strong, a man who knew what he wanted.</p><p>By the end of dinner, Nicholas had grown quiet and something seemed to be worrying him. They were silent as they walked back to the bed-and-breakfast. Nor did he want to talk once they were in their room. He didn\u2019t even want Dougless to read to him. When he went to bed, he turned away from her without so much as a good night.</p><p>Dougless lay awake for a long time, trying to puzzle out what had happened to her in the last few days. She had cried and begged for a Knight in Shining Armor and Nicholas had come to her. That one fact seemed to prove that he was hers and she was meant to keep him.</p><p>Near midnight, just as she was finally dozing, she was startled by sounds from Nicholas. She smiled, knowing he was again having a bad dream. Still smiling, she went to him and climbed into bed beside him. At once he clasped her in his arms and immediately fell into a peaceful sleep. Dougless snuggled close, her cheek on his furred chest, and contentedly went to sleep. Let what is to be, happen, she thought.</p><p>When Nicholas awoke it was daylight, and when he realized Dougless was in his arms, he knew his dreams had come true. She fit his body as though they were carved from one piece of earth. What was the word she used? Telepathy. There was a feeling between them, a deep bond that he\u2019d never come close to feeling with another woman.</p><p>Putting his face in her hair, he breathed deeply, and his hands began to caress her. He\u2019d never felt such lust as he felt for her, never even known such lust existed.</p><p>\u201cGive me strength,\u201d he prayed, \u201cstrength to do what I must. And forgive me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He hoped he could do what he had to, but first he wanted to taste her, just this once, this one and only time; then never again would he allow himself to touch her.</p><p>He kissed her hair, her neck, his tongue on her smooth skin. His hand ran up her arm, then covered her breast. Nicholas\u2019s heart was in his ears.</p><p>Waking, Dougless turned in his arms to kiss him\u2014a kiss such as she\u2019d never experienced before. The other half of me, she thought. What I have been missing all my life is this man. He\u2019s the other half of me.</p><p>\u201cLettice,\u201d Nicholas murmured near her ear.</p><p>Their legs were entwined, their arms clasping one another. Dougless smiled, her head back as Nicholas placed hot kisses on her neck and throat. \u201cI\u2019ve been called . . . Carrots,\u201d she said, breathless, \u201cfor my hair, but never lettuce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLettice is . . .\u201d He was kissing down her throat, lower and lower. \u201cLettice is my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Dougless murmured as his hand caressed her breast and his lips went lower.</p><p>What he\u2019d said hit her suddenly. She pushed away to look at him. \u201cWife?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Nicholas pulled her back to him. \u201cWe care naught for her now.\u201d</p><p>She pushed away from him again. \u201cYou seem to care about her enough to say her name when you\u2019re kissing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mere slip,\u201d he said, pulling her toward him.</p><p>Dougless shoved at him hard, then got out of bed and straightened her unbuttoned gown. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you explain to me about this wife of yours?\u201d she demanded angrily. \u201cAnd why haven\u2019t I heard of her before? I know you had a child, but you said the mother had died.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas sat up in bed, the sheet to his waist. \u201cThere was no reason to tell of my wife. Her beauty, her talents, and my love for her are private to me.\u201d He picked up Dougless\u2019s watch off the table. \u201cPerhaps today we will purchase me such as this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut that down!\u201d Dougless snapped. \u201cThis is serious. I think you owe me an explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain to you?\u201d Nicholas said, getting out of bed, wearing only a pair of tiny briefs. He pulled on his trousers, then turned to her as he fastened them. \u201cPray, madam, who are you? Are you a duke\u2019s daughter? An earl\u2019s? Even a baron\u2019s? I am the earl of Thornwyck, and you are my servant. You work for me. In return, I feed you and clothe you, and perhaps, if you are worth it, I will mayhap give you a small stipend. I have no obligation to tell you of my own life.\u201d</p><p>Dougless sat down hard on the bed. \u201cBut you never mentioned a wife,\u201d she said softly. \u201cNot once have you referred to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be a poor husband to profane my beloved\u2019s name to my servant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cServant,\u201d Dougless whispered. \u201cDo you love her very much?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas snorted. \u201cShe is the true reason I must return. I must find the truth, then return to my loving wife\u2019s arms.\u201d</p><p>Dougless was having difficulty understanding what she was hearing. Robert yesterday and today finding that Nicholas had a wife\u2014a wife he loved madly\u2014was more than she could handle. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said, burying her face in her hands. \u201cI wished you here. I prayed for you. Why did you come to me if you love someone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou prayed on my tomb. Perhaps if anyone had done that\u2014man or woman\u2014I would have come forth. Perhaps God knew I would need a servant and you needed work. I do not know. All I do know is that I must return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, to my wife.\u201d</p><p>She turned to look at him. \u201cAnd what of this?\u201d she asked, motioning to the bed.</p><p>\u201cMadam, you placed yourself in my bed. I am but a man, therefore I am weak.\u201d</p><p>As understanding came to Dougless, she began to feel deeply embarrassed. Was there any woman on earth who was a bigger fool than she was? Was there any man on earth she hadn\u2019t fallen in love with? Let her spend three days with a man and she began to imagine a life together. If Attila the Hun or Jack the Ripper had come forward, she\u2019d no doubt have fallen in love with him. With her luck, she\u2019d be in love with Genghis Khan in two days.</p><p>She stood up. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry for the misunderstanding. Of course you have a wife. A beautiful wife and three lovely kids. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking of. You were on death row and married. I\u2019m used to guys with only one major strike against them. I just seem to get luckier and luckier. I\u2019ll get my things and get out of here. You go back to Mrs. Stafford and have a swell life.\u201d</p><p>He blocked the entrance to the bathroom. \u201cYou mean to unkiss the bargain?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Unkiss\u2019?\u201d she asked, voice rising. \u201cAgain with the \u2018unkiss.\u2019 Yes, I mean to unkiss, unhug, un-whatever else it needs. You don\u2019t need me, not when you have lovely Lettice and Arabella-on-the-table.\u201d</p><p>When Nicholas moved toward her, his voice lowered seductively. \u201cIf our interrupted love play annoys you, we may return to the bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on your life, buster,\u201d she said, eyes blazing. \u201cPut one hand on me and you draw back a bloody nub.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas put his hand over his jaw to hide a smile. \u201cI see no cause for your anger. I have represented myself truly. I need help in searching for the person who betrayed me. I want to find the information and return to my home. I have never been false with you.\u201d</p><p>Dougless turned away. He was right. He\u2019d never been secretive in any way. She was the one who\u2019d imagined castles in the sky and their living happily ever after. Idiot, idiot, idiot, she told herself.</p><p>She turned back to him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about all this. Maybe you should get someone else to help you. I\u2019ve got my passport now, and my plane ticket, so I think I\u2019d better go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cI see. You are a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am no such thing. It\u2019s just . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have fallen in love with me,\u201d he said with a sigh of resignation. \u201cAll the women do. It is a curse that plagues me much. I cannot spend three days with a woman and not have her come to my bed. Think not on it. I do not blame you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t blame me?\u201d Anger was beginning to replace Dougless\u2019s self-pity. \u201cListen, mister! You overrate your charms by a long shot. You don\u2019t know what women are like today. Any liberated women could live in the same house with you and not fall for you. We don\u2019t like conceited, puffed-up peacocks like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he said, one eyebrow raised. \u201cIt is just you who is different? In just three days\u2019 time you are in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your information, I was trying to settle you down after a nightmare. I thought I was comforting you. Like a mother and child.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas smiled. \u201cComfort? You may comfort me any morn you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it for your wife. Now, will you get out of the way? I need to get dressed and get out of here.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on her arm. \u201cYou are angry at me that I kissed you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m angry at you because . . .\u201d She turned away. Why was she angry at him? He\u2019d awakened and found her in his bed and he\u2019d started kissing her. Before today, he hadn\u2019t made a pass at her; he hadn\u2019t been anything but a gentleman. Never once had he even hinted that they were more than employer and employee.</p><p>It was she who\u2019d made everything up. Out of his teasings, out of the laughter they\u2019d shared and, especially, out of her hurt over Robert, she\u2019d imagined more between them than there was.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not angry at you at all,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m mad at myself. I guess I was on the rebound.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Rebound\u2019?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSometimes when you get jilted, or abandoned as I was, you want to jump right back on the train.\u201d He still looked puzzled. \u201cI thought maybe you could replace Robert. Or maybe I just wanted to go home with a ring on my finger. If I went home engaged, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have too many questions asked about the man I left America with and what happened to him.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I thought. Maybe you better get someone else to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. You could not resist me. It is as the guide said. No woman can withstand me.\u201d</p><p>Dougless groaned. \u201cI could withstand you all right. Now that I know the true extent of your enormous ego, I could live with you and not fall for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou could not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could, and I\u2019ll prove it. I\u2019ll find your secret for you, and even if it takes years, I won\u2019t even be tempted by you.\u201d She narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou have any more bad dreams and wake me up, I\u2019ll throw a pillow at you. Now will you let me in the bathroom?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stepped aside, and she angrily closed the door behind her, but he couldn\u2019t help grinning at the door. Ah, Dougless, he thought, my sweet, sweet Dougless. You may be able to resist me, but how will I resist you? A year together? A year without touching you? I will go mad.</p><p>He turned away to finish dressing.</p><p>TEN</p> <p>The long black car made its way south through the beautiful English countryside. In the backseat Nicholas looked across at Dougless. She was sitting stiffly upright. Her lovely, thick auburn hair was pulled tightly back to the nape of her neck and put in what she told him was called a bun. Since this morning she had not smiled or laughed or made any comment except, \u201cYes, sir,\u201d or \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDougless,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off. \u201cI believe, Lord Stafford, we have already discussed this. I am Miss Montgomery\u2014not Mistress Montgomery\u2014your secretary, no more, no less. If you will remember that, sir, it will prevent people from thinking that I am more to you than I am.\u201d</p><p>Turning away, he sighed. He could think of nothing to say to her, and actually, he knew this attitude was the better way, but already, he missed her.</p><p>Moments later his attention was caught by the tower of Thornwyck Castle, and he found his heart beginning to beat a little faster. He had designed this place. He had taken what he knew and loved of every house he\u2019d ever seen, improved on every idea, and created this beautiful house. It had taken four years to cut the stone and to ship the marble from Italy. Among his many ideas, in the inner courtyard he had built towers with curved glass in them.</p><p>Thornwyck Castle had been only half finished when he was arrested, but the half that was completed had been as beautiful as any building in the land.</p> <p>Nicholas frowned as the driver turned into the drive. Now, his house looked so old. Just a month ago he had been here, and then it had been new and perfect. Now the chimney pots were crumbling, there were broken places along the roof, and some of his windows had been bricked in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Dougless whispered, then straightened, \u201csir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is crumbling,\u201d Nicholas said in anger. \u201cAnd were the western towers never completed? I drew the plans. Did no one see them?\u201d</p><p>When the car stopped, Nicholas got out and looked around. To his mind, it was a sad place, the unfinished half in ruins, the other half looking hundreds of years old\u2014which it was, he thought with dismay.</p><p>When he turned back, Dougless had already entered the hotel lobby, two boys behind her carrying their luggage. \u201cLord Stafford will want early tea at eight A.M.,\u201d she was telling the desk clerk. \u201cAnd he takes luncheon promptly at noon, but I must be given a menu beforehand.\u201d She turned to him. \u201cWould you like to sign the register, my lord, or should I?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas gave her a quelling look, warning her with his eyes to stop her pompous behavior. He\u2019d seen enough of the modern world to know that she was acting strangely. But Dougless turned away, acting as though she hadn\u2019t seen his look. Nicholas quickly signed the guest book in an unreadable scrawl; then the clerk led them to their suite.</p><p>The room was beautiful, with dark rose-colored wallpaper and a four-poster bed hung with rose and yellow chintz. A little couch in yellow and pale green sat at the foot of the bed on a rose-colored carpet. Through an arched-top doorway was a small sitting room decorated in shades of rose and pale green.</p><p>\u201cI will need a cot put in here,\u201d Dougless said, indicating the sitting room.</p> <p>\u201cA cot?\u201d the clerk asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. For me to sleep on. You did not think that I would sleep in his lordship\u2019s chamber, did you?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas rolled his eyes. Even in his own time this behavior would be strange.</p><p>\u201cYes, miss,\u201d the clerk said. \u201cI will have a cot sent up.\u201d He left them alone.</p><p>\u201cDougless,\u201d Nicholas began.</p><p>\u201cMiss Montgomery,\u201d she said in a cold voice.</p><p>\u201cMiss Montgomery,\u201d he said just as coolly, \u201csee that my capcases are sent up. I plan to look at my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I accompany you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, I want no hellkite with me,\u201d he said angrily, then left the room.</p><p>Dougless saw that the suitcases were brought up, then asked the clerk where the local library was. Feeling very efficient, she set off through the little village, notebook and pens in hand, but as she neared the library, her steps slowed.</p><p>Don\u2019t think about your life, she told herself. Being dropped by one man and immediately finding another one\u2014a good one\u2014was all a dream, an impossible, unreachable dream. Cold, she thought, I have to remain cold. Think of Antarctica. Siberia. Do your job and remain cool to him. He belongs to another woman and to another time.</p><p>It was easy finding what the librarian called the \u201cStafford Collection.\u201d \u201cMany of the visitors to our village ask after the Staffords, especially the guests staying at Thornwyck Castle,\u201d the librarian said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m especially interested in the last earl, Nicholas Stafford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, poor man, condemned to be beheaded, then dying before the execution. It\u2019s believed he was poisoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoisoned by whom?\u201d Dougless asked eagerly as she followed the woman into the stacks.</p><p>\u201cBy the person who accused him of treason, of course,\u201d she said, looking at Dougless as though she didn\u2019t understand even simple things. \u201cIt\u2019s believed that Lord Nicholas built Thornwyck Castle. A local historian says that he believes Lord Nicholas may have even designed it, but no one can prove it. No one has found drawings with his name on them. Well, here we are, all the books on this shelf have something in them about the Staffords.\u201d</p><p>After the librarian left, Dougless took out each book, searched the index for any mention of Nicholas or his mother, and began reading.</p><p>One of the first things she did was look for the name Nicholas had given her of the man he said had had a grudge against him. It was the name he had been writing to his mother when he\u2019d heard Dougless crying. \u201cLand disputes,\u201d Nicholas had said, by way of explaning the grudge. But after only ten minutes of searching, Dougless had found the man\u2019s name. He had died six months before Nicholas had been arrested, so he couldn\u2019t have been the one who told the queen Nicholas was raising an army.</p><p>What little she could find on Nicholas was told in a derogatory way.</p><p>His older brother, Christopher, had been made earl when he was twenty-two, and the books raved about how Christopher had taken the failing Stafford fortunes and rebuilt them. Nicholas, only a year younger, was portrayed as frivolous, spending vast amounts on horses and women. He had been the earl for only four years before he was tried for treason.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Dougless said aloud, opening another book. This one was even more unflattering. It told at length the story of Lady Arabella and the table. It seems that two servants were in the room when Nicholas and Arabella entered, and they ducked into a closet when they heard the lord and lady. Later the servants told everyone what they\u2019d seen, and a clerk by the name of John Wilfred had put the whole story down in his diary\u2014a diary that had survived until the present.</p><p>The third book was more serious. It told of Christopher\u2019s great accomplishments, then added that his wastrel of a younger brother had squandered everything on a foolhardy attempt to put Mary Queen of Scots on Elizabeth\u2019s throne.</p><p>Dougless slammed the book shut and looked at her watch. It was time for tea. She left the library and made her way to a pretty little tea shop. After she had been served tea and a plate of scones, she began reading her notes.</p><p>\u201cI have sought you most earnestly.\u201d</p><p>She looked up to see Nicholas standing over her. \u201cShould I rise until you are seated, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Miss Montgomery, a mere kiss of my toes will be sufficient.\u201d</p><p>Dougless almost smiled, but she didn\u2019t. He got himself a tray of tea, but Dougless had to pay for it, as he still carried no money.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you read?\u201d</p><p>Coolly, she told him what she had found out, sparing him no details of what history had recorded about him. Except for a slight flush around his collar, he didn\u2019t seem to react.</p><p>\u201cThere is no mention in your history books that I was chamberlain to my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone. It says you bought horses and fooled around with women.\u201d And she\u2019d thought she could love such a man! But then, it seemed that a lot of women had thought so.</p><p>Nicholas ate a scone and drank his tea. \u201cWhen I return, I will change your history books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t change history. History is fact; it\u2019s already made. And you certainly can\u2019t change what the history books say. They\u2019re already printed.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer her. \u201cWhat did your book say of my family after my death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t look that far. I only read about your brother and you.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a cool look. \u201cYou read only of the bad about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all there was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of my design of Thornwyck? When the queen saw my plan, she hailed it as a monument of greatness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no record that you designed it. The librarian said some people believed you did, but there was no proof.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas put down his half-eaten scone. \u201cCome,\u201d he said angrily. \u201cI will show you what I did. I will show you the great work I left behind me.\u201d</p><p>As he strode out of the tea room, the unfinished scone was testimony to how upset he was. He walked ahead of her with long, angry strides, and Dougless had difficulty keeping up with him as they went back to the hotel.</p><p>To Dougless the hotel was beautiful, but to Nicholas it was mostly ruins. To the left of the entrance were what she\u2019d assumed were stone fences, but he showed her that they were walls to what would have been nearly half of the house. Now there was grass underfoot and vines growing down the walls. He told her of the beauty of these rooms if they had been built as he designed them: paneling, stained glass, carved marble fireplaces. He pointed high on one wall to a stone face, worn by rain and time. \u201cMy brother,\u201d he said. \u201cI had the likeness carved of him.\u201d</p><p>As they walked down long avenues of roofless rooms and Nicholas talked, Dougless began to see what he had planned. She could almost hear the lutes in the music room.</p><p>\u201cAnd now it is this,\u201d he said at last. \u201cA place for cows and goats and . . . yeomen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd their daughters,\u201d Dougless said, including herself in his derogatory description.</p><p>Turning, he looked at her with cool contempt. \u201cYou believe what these fools have written about me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou believe my life was naught but horses and women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that, the books did, my lord,\u201d she answered him in the same tone.</p><p>\u201cOn the morrow we will begin to find what the books do not say.\u201d</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>In the morning they were both at the library when the door was unlocked. After spending twenty minutes explaining the free library system to Nicholas, Dougless got five of the books on the Staffords from the shelves and began to read. Nicholas sat across from her, staring at the pages of a book, and frowning in consternation. After thirty minutes of watching him struggle, Dougless took pity on him.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, sir,\u201d she said softly, \u201cin the evenings I might teach you to read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeach me to read?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIn America I teach school, and I\u2019ve had quite a bit of experience teaching children to read. I\u2019m sure you could learn,\u201d she said gently.</p><p>\u201cCould I?\u201d he asked, one eyebrow raised. He didn\u2019t say any more, but got up, went to the librarian, and asked her a few questions, which Dougless couldn\u2019t hear. Smiling, the librarian nodded, left the desk for a moment, then returned and handed him several books.</p><p>Nicholas put the books on the table in front of Dougless and opened the top one. \u201cThere, Miss Montgomery, read that to me.\u201d</p><p>On the page was an incomprehensible type-face of oddly-shaped letters and strangely-spelled words. She looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cThis is my printing.\u201d Picking the book up, he looked at the title page. \u201cIt is a play by a man named William Shakespeare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard of him? I thought Shakespeare was as Elizabethan as any man ever was.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas, starting to read, took a seat across from her. \u201cNay, I have no knowledge of him.\u201d Quickly, he became absorbed in his reading as Dougless dug more into the history books.</p><p>She could find very little about what happened after Nicholas\u2019s death. The estates had been taken over by the queen. Neither Christopher nor Nicholas had children, so the Stafford title and line had died with them. Again and again, she read of what a wastrel Nicholas had been and how he\u2019d betrayed his entire family.</p><p>At noon they went to a pub for lunch. After their first visit, Nicholas had not insisted upon a heavy midday meal. He was beginning to get used to the light lunches, but he continued to grumble.</p><p>\u201cFoolish children,\u201d he said, moving his food about on his plate. \u201cIf they had listened to their parents, they would have lived. Your world fosters such disobedience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the play. Juliet and . . .\u201d He paused, trying to remember.</p><p>\u201cRomeo and Juliet? You\u2019ve been reading Romeo and Juliet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and a more disobedient lot I have never seen. That play is a good lesson to children everywhere. I hope children today read it and learn from it.\u201d</p><p>Dougless nearly screeched at him. \u201cRomeo and Juliet is about romance, and if the parents hadn\u2019t been so narrow-minded and uptight, they\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNarrow-minded? They were good parents. They knew such a liaison could only end in tragedy\u2014and it did!\u201d he said fiercely.</p><p>Dougless\u2019s ideas of being cool fled her mind. \u201cThe tragedy came because the parents\u2014\u201d They argued throughout the meal.</p><p>Later, as they walked back to the library, Dougless asked him how his brother Christopher had died.</p><p>Nicholas stopped walking and looked away. \u201cI was to go hunting with him that day, but I had cut my arm during sword practice.\u201d Dougless saw him rubbing his left forearm. \u201cI still bear the scar.\u201d After a moment Nicholas turned to her, and she could see the pain in his eyes. Whatever she thought of Nicholas Stafford, she had no doubt of his love for his brother. \u201cHe drowned. I was not the only brother who liked women. Kit saw a pretty girl swimming in a lake, and he told his men to leave him alone with her. After a few hours the men returned to find my brother floating in the lake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd no one saw what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay. Perhaps the girl did, but we never found her.\u201d</p><p>Dougless was thoughtful for a moment. \u201cHow odd that your brother drowned with no witnesses to attest to what happened; then a few years later you were tried for treason. It\u2019s almost as though someone planned to take the Stafford estates.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s face changed. He looked at her with that expression men have when a woman says something they\u2019ve not thought of\u2014as though the impossible has happened.</p><p>\u201cWho stood to inherit? Your dear, darling Lettice?\u201d Dougless snapped her lips together, wishing she\u2019d kept the jealousy out of her voice.</p> <p>Nicholas didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cLettice had her marriage property, but she lost all at my death. I inherited from Kit, but I can assure you I did not wish for his death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much responsibility?\u201d Dougless asked. \u201cBeing the boss carries a burden to it.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a look of anger. \u201cYou believe your history books. Come,\u201d he said, \u201cyou must read more. You must discover who betrayed me.\u201d</p><p>Dougless read all afternoon while Nicholas laughed over The Merchant of Venice, but she could find out nothing more.</p><p>In the evening Nicholas wanted her to dine with him, but she refused. She knew she had to spend less time with him. Her heart was too newly broken and she had come too close to caring more for him than was good for her. Looking like a sad little boy, he stuck his hands in his pockets and went downstairs to dinner, while Dougless asked for a bowl of soup and some bread to be brought up to her room. As she ate, she went over her notes, but could come up with no new ideas. No one seemed to gain anything by the deaths of Christopher and Nicholas.</p><p>About ten P.M., Nicholas had still not returned from dinner so, curious, she went downstairs to look for him. He was in the beautiful stone-walled drawing room laughing with half a dozen guests. Dougless stood in the shadow of the doorway and watched\u2014and anger, unreasonable, unjust anger, flooded her body. She had called him forward, but now two other women were drooling over him.</p> <p>Turning away, she left the hallway. He was exactly as the books said, she thought. No wonder someone had so easily betrayed him. When he should have been taking care of business, he was probably in bed with some woman.</p><p>She went upstairs, put on her nightgown, and got into the little bed the hotel had brought up for her. But she didn\u2019t sleep. Instead, she lay there feeling angry and foolish. Maybe she should have left with Robert. Robert had a bit of a problem about sharing money and he did love his daughter excessively, but he\u2019d always been faithful to her.</p><p>At about eleven she heard Nicholas open the bedroom door, and she saw light under the door between their rooms. When she heard him open her door, she tightly closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDougless,\u201d he whispered, but she didn\u2019t answer. \u201cI know you do not sleep, so answer me.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes. \u201cShould I get my pad and paper? I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t take shorthand.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, Nicholas took a step toward her. \u201cI felt something from you tonight. Anger? Dougless, I do not want us to be enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not enemies,\u201d she said sternly. \u201cWe are employer and employee. You are an earl and I am a commoner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDougless,\u201d he said, his voice pleading and all too seductive. \u201cYou are not common. I meant . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>He backed away. \u201cForgive me. I have had too much to drink, and my tongue runs away from me. I meant what I said. On the morrow you must discover more about my family. Good night, Miss Montgomery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, aye, Captain,\u201d she said mockingly.</p><p>In the morning, she refused to eat breakfast with him. This is better, she told herself. Do not relax for even a moment. Remind yourself that he is as much a scoundrel now as he was then. She walked to the library alone, and when she looked out its windows, she saw Nicholas laughing with a pretty young woman. Dougless buried her nose in the book.</p><p>Nicholas was still smiling when he came to sit across from her. \u201cA new friend?\u201d she asked, and immediately wished she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cShe is an American and she was telling me about baseball. And football.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told her that you\u2019ve never heard of those sports because last week you were in Elizabethan England?\u201d Dougless was aghast.</p><p>Nicholas smiled. \u201cShe believes me to be a man of learning, so I have had not time for such tilly-fally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLearning, ha!\u201d Dougless muttered.</p><p>Nicholas continued to smile. \u201cYou are jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous? Most certainly not. I am your employee. I have no right to be jealous. Did you tell her about your wife?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas picked up one of the books of Shakespeare\u2019s plays the librarian had left out for him. \u201cYou are frampold this morning,\u201d he said, but he was smiling as though he was pleased.</p><p>Dougless had no idea what he meant, so she wrote the word down and looked it up later. Disagreeable. So, he thought she was disagreeable, did he? She went back to her research.</p><p>At three o\u2019clock she nearly jumped out of her chair. \u201cLook! It\u2019s here.\u201d Excitedly, she went around the table to take the chair next to Nicholas. \u201cThis paragraph, see?\u201d He did, but he could read only phrases of it. She was holding a two-month-old copy of a magazine on English history.</p><p>\u201cThis article is on Goshawk Hall that we heard about at Bellwood. It says that there\u2019s been a recent find at Goshawk of papers of the Stafford family\u2014and the papers date from the sixteenth century. The papers are now being studied by Dr. Hamilton J. Nolman, a young man with . . . There\u2019s an impressive list of his credentials, then . . . it says that Dr. Nolman \u2018hopes to prove that Nicholas Stafford, who was accused of treason at the beginning of Elizabeth the First\u2019s reign, was actually innocent.\u2019\u201d</p><p>When Dougless looked at Nicholas, the expression in his eyes was almost embarrassing.</p><p>\u201cThis is why I have been sent here,\u201d he said softly. \u201cNothing could be proved until these papers were found. We must go to Goshawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just go. First, we\u2019ll have to petition the owners to look at the papers.\u201d She closed the magazine. \u201cWhat size of house must it be to have misplaced a trunkload of papers for four hundred years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoshawk Hall is not so large as four of my houses,\u201d Nicholas said as though he were offended.</p><p>Dougless leaned back in the chair and felt that at last they were getting somewhere. She had no doubt that these papers had belonged to Nicholas\u2019s mother, and they contained the information Nicholas needed to prove himself innocent.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello.\u201d</p><p>They looked up to see the pretty young woman who had explained baseball to Nicholas. \u201cI thought that was you,\u201d she said, then gave Dougless the once-over. \u201cIs this your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m merely his secretary,\u201d Dougless said, rising. \u201cWill there be anything else, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord?!\u201d the young woman gasped. \u201cYou\u2019re a lord?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas started to leave with Dougless, but the overexcited American, thrilled at meeting a lord, would not allow him to go.</p><p>As Dougless went back to the hotel, she was trying her best to think of her letter to Goshawk Hall, but, actually, she was thinking mostly of Nicholas flirting with the pretty American. It didn\u2019t matter to her, of course. This was just a job. Soon she\u2019d be home, teaching her fifth graders, dating now and then, visiting her family and telling them all about England\u2014and explaining how she was ditched by one man and half fell in love with a man who was married and about four hundred and fifty-one years old.</p><p>The best Dougless-story yet, she thought.</p><p>By the time she got to the hotel, she was slamming things about. Damn all men, she thought. Damn the good ones as well as the bad. They broke your heart over and over again.</p><p>\u201cI see your temper has not improved,\u201d Nicholas said from behind her.</p><p>\u201cMy temper is not your concern,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI was hired to do a job, and I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m going to write Goshawk Hall and see when we can look at the papers.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas was beginning to get angry himself. \u201cThe animosity you be-mete to me has not foundation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no animosity toward you,\u201d she said with fury. \u201cI\u2019m doing my best to help you so you can get back to your loving wife and to your own time.\u201d Her head came up. \u201cI just realized that there\u2019s no need for you to be here. I can do the research alone. You can\u2019t read modern books anyway. Why don\u2019t you go to . . . to the French Riviera or somewhere? I can do this by myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would that I leave?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cSure, why not? You could go to London and party. You could meet all the beautiful women of this century. We have lots of tables nowadays.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stiffened. \u201cYou want away from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, and yes,\u201d she said. \u201cMy research would go much better without you. You\u2019re . . . you\u2019re just getting in my way. You know nothing about my world, so you can\u2019t help me. You can barely dress yourself, you still eat with your hands half the time, you can\u2019t read or write our language, and I have to explain the simplest things to you. It would be a thousand times better if you left me alone.\u201d Her hands were gripping the chair back so hard her knuckles appeared to be about to come through the skin.</p><p>When she glanced up at him, the na**d pain on his face was more than she could bear. He had to leave, she thought. He had to let her piece her mind and body back together. Before she yet again humiliated herself with tears, she turned and left the room. Once she was in her own sleeping alcove, she leaned against the door and cried deeply.</p><p>Just to get this over, she thought, to send him away, to go back home and never even look at another man again, that\u2019s what she needed.</p><p>She fell down on her bed, buried her face in her pillow, and cried silently. She cried for a long time, until the worst of it was over and she began to feel better. And once her tears were shed, she began to think more clearly.</p><p>How stupid she\u2019d been acting! What had Nicholas done wrong? She visualized him sitting in a dungeon awaiting execution for a crime he didn\u2019t commit, then the next minute he\u2019s floating through the air and he\u2019s in the twentieth century.</p><p>She sat up and blew her nose. And how well he\u2019d handled everything! He\u2019d adjusted to automobiles, paper money, a strange language, strange food, and . . . And a weepy woman suffering from the rejection of another man. Yet, through it all, Nicholas had been generous with his money, his laughter, and his knowledge.</p><p>And what had Dougless done? She\u2019d been furious with him because he\u2019d dared marry another woman some four hundred years ago.</p><p>When she looked at it that way, it was almost humorous. She glanced up at the door. Her room was dark, but there was light coming under the door. The things she\u2019d said to him! Awful, terrible things.</p><p>She practically ran to the door and flung it open. \u201cNicholas, I\u2014\u201d The room was empty. She opened the door into the hall and looked out, but the hallway was also empty. When she turned back into the room, she saw the note on the floor, where he must have slipped it under her door. Quickly she looked at the note.</p><p>Dougless had no idea what the words said, but to her eyes the paper looked like an Elizabethan runaway note. His clothes were still in the closet and so were his capcases\u2014suitcases, she corrected herself.</p><p>She had to find him and apologize, tell him he shouldn\u2019t leave, tell him that she did need his help. Her head seemed to ring with all the rotten, terrible things she\u2019d said to him in the last two days. He could read. And he had lovely table manners. He\u2014 Damn, damn, damn, she thought as she tore down the stairs and ran out of the hotel into the rain.</p><p>She clasped her hands about her upper arms, put her head down, and started running. She had to find him. He probably had no idea what an umbrella was or a raincoat. He\u2019d catch his death. Or he\u2019d be fighting the rain so hard he\u2019d walk in front of a bus\u2014or a train. Would he know a train track from a sidewalk? What if he got on a train by himself? He wouldn\u2019t know where to get off\u2014or how to get back to her if he did get off.</p><p>She ran to the train station, but it was closed. Good, she thought, pushing cold, wet hair out of her face so she could see. She tried to read the dial on her watch, but the rain was hitting her in the face too hard to see clearly. It looked to be after eleven, so she must have been crying for hours. She shivered, thinking what could have happened to him in all those hours.</p><p>There was a shadow in a gutter, and Dougless ran to it, knowing it was Nicholas lying dead in a heap. But it was only a shadow. Blinking, trying to keep her eyes open against the rain, sneezing twice, she looked at the dark windows of the village.</p><p>Maybe he had just started walking. How far could a person walk in . . . ? She didn\u2019t even know how long he\u2019d been gone. Which direction had he gone?</p><p>She started running toward the end of the street, cold water splashing up the back of her legs and under her skirt. There seemed to be no lights on anywhere; then, as she rounded a corner, she saw a light in a window. A pub, she thought. She\u2019d ask there and see if anyone had seen him.</p><p>When she walked in, the warmth and light of the pub hit her so strongly that for a moment she couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>Freezing, shivering, dripping, she stood still to allow her eyes to adjust to the light; then she heard a laugh that had become familiar to her. Nicholas! she thought, as she ran through the smoke-filled room.</p><p>What she saw was like a painting advertising the seven sins. Nicholas, his shirt unbuttoned to the waist, a cigar clamped between his strong teeth, sat behind a table that looked as though it might break under the weight of the food on it. There was a pretty woman on either side of him, and there was lipstick on his cheeks and his shirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDougless,\u201d he said in delight. \u201cCome join us.\u201d</p><p>She stood there feeling like a wet cat, her hair plastered against her head, her clothes sticking to her, a gallon of water in each shoe, a puddle at her feet that could sail a three-masted schooner.</p><p>\u201cGet up from there and come with me,\u201d she said in the voice she used to settle down unruly schoolchildren.</p><p>\u201cAye, aye, Captain,\u201d Nicholas said, smiling and mocking her at the same time.</p> <p>He\u2019s drunk, she thought.</p><p>He kissed each woman on the mouth, then leaped onto the seat, bounded over the table, and swooped Dougless into his arms. \u201cPut me down,\u201d she hissed, but he carried her through the pub and outside.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s raining,\u201d she said, her lips tight and her arms folded over her chest.</p><p>\u201cNay, madam, it is a clear night.\u201d Still holding her, he began to nuzzle her neck.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to start that again. Put me down at once.\u201d</p> <p>He put her down, but he did so in such a way that her body slid down his.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drunk,\u201d she said, pushing him away.</p><p>\u201cOh, aye, I am that,\u201d he said happily. \u201cThe ale here pleases me. And the women please me,\u201d he said as he caught her about the waist.</p><p>Dougless again pushed him away. \u201cI was worried about you and here you were boozing it up with a couple of floozies and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo fast,\u201d he cried. \u201cToo many words. Here, my pretty Dougless, look at the stars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, I happen to be very wet and I\u2019m also freezing.\u201d As though to emphasize the fact, she sneezed.</p> <p>Once again, he lifted her into his arms. \u201cPut me down!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are cold; I am warm,\u201d he said, as though that settled the matter. \u201cYou feared for me?\u201d</p><p>Was it possible to stay angry at this man for very long? She was willing to admit defeat as she snuggled against him. He was indeed warm. \u201cI said some awful things to you, and I\u2019m very sorry. You aren\u2019t really a burden.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at her. \u201cIs this the cause of your fear? That perhaps I was angered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. When you were gone, I thought maybe you\u2019d walked in front of a bus or a train. I was afraid of your being hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I appear to have no pia mater?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrain. Do I seem stupid to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, of course not. You just don\u2019t know how our modern world works, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Who is wet and who is dry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of us are wet, since you continue carrying me,\u201d she said smugly.</p><p>\u201cFor all your knowledge, I have found what we need to know, and tomorrow we ride to Goshawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find out anything and from whom? Those women in there? Did you kiss it out of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous, Montgomery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Stafford, I am not.\u201d That statement proved that the Pinocchio theory was false. Her nose didn\u2019t grow at all. (She checked to make sure.) \u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDickie Harewood owns Goshawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut didn\u2019t he marry your mother? Is he as old as you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeware, or I will show you how old I am.\u201d He shifted her in his arms. \u201cAm I feeding you too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more likely you\u2019re weak from flirting with all the women. It saps a man\u2019s strength, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine has not been impaired. Now, I was telling you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Dickie Harewood still owns Goshawk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, on the morrow I shall see him. What is a weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the end of the workweek when everyone gets off. And you can\u2019t just go riding up to some lord\u2019s house. I hope you\u2019re not thinking of inviting yourself for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe workers get off? But no one seems to work at all. I see no farmers in the fields, no one plowing. People now shop and drive cars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a forty-hour workweek and tractors. Nicholas, you\u2019re not answering me. What are you planning to do? You really can\u2019t tell this man Harewood you\u2019re from the sixteenth century. You can\u2019t tell anyone that, even women in bars.\u201d She tugged at his collar. \u201cYou\u2019ve ruined that shirt. Lipstick never comes out.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he shifted her again. \u201cYou have on none of this lipstick.\u201d</p><p>She moved her head away from him. \u201cDon\u2019t start that again. Now, tell me about Goshawk Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Harewood family owns it still. They come for the end . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, the weekend, and\u2014\u201d He gave Dougless a sideways look. \u201cArabella is there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArabella? What does the twentieth-century Arabella have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Arabella was Dickie Harewood\u2019s daughter, and there seems to be a Dickie Harewood again at Goshawk hall, and he again has a daughter named Arabella who is the same age as my Arabella was when we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me,\u201d Dougless said, then looked at him in silence for a moment. The papers recently found, another Arabella, and another Dickie. It was almost as though history were repeating itself. How odd, she thought.</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>Dougless watched Nicholas atop the stallion and held her breath. She\u2019d heard of people riding horses like this one, but she\u2019d never seen it. Every employee and every visitor at the riding stables had stopped to watch as Nicholas brought the high-strung, angry, mean-tempered animal under control.</p><p>Last night they\u2019d stayed up until after one A.M. while Dougless made him tell her all about his relationship to the Harewoods. They\u2019d had estates near one another. Dickie was old enough to be Nicholas\u2019s father and he\u2019d had a daughter, Arabella, who\u2019d married Lord Robert Sydney. She and her husband had hated each other, so after she\u2019d given him an heir, they\u2019d lived apart, although Arabella had given birth to three more children.</p><p>\u201cOne of them yours,\u201d Dougless had said, taking notes.</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s face softened. \u201cThere is no reason to think ill of her. She and the child died in that childbirth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Dougless said with a grimace, and knew that the woman could easily have died from something as simple as the midwife\u2019s not washing her hands.</p><p>Dougless tried to think of a way to get invited to the Harewood estates as quickly as possible, but she had no credentials as a scholar, and although Nicholas was an earl, his title had been taken from him when he was condemned for treason. He couldn\u2019t even claim to be his own aristocratic descendant. She thought until she couldn\u2019t stay awake any longer; then she\u2019d bid Nicholas good night and gone to her own bed.</p><p>\u201cThis is better,\u201d she thought as she drifted into sleep. She had her emotions under control. She was getting over Robert and she was no longer thinking she was falling for a married man. She\u2019d help Nicholas get back to his wife, help him clear his name; then she\u2019d go home feeling good about herself. For once in her life she was not going to fall for an unsuitable man.</p><p>Nicholas woke her early the next morning by throwing open the sitting room door. \u201cCan you ride a horse? Can anyone today ride a horse?\u201d</p><p>Dougless assured him she could ride, courtesy of her Colorado cousins; then after breakfast she\u2019d found a nearby riding stables. It was four miles to the stables and Nicholas insisted they walk. \u201cYour machines have made you lazy,\u201d he said, slapping her on the back as he set off at a brisk pace. At the stables, as Dougless sat on a bench fanning herself, Nicholas had turned up his nose at all the horses for rent, but his eyes had lit up at the sight of an enormous black horse in a field. The animal was prancing about and tossing its head as though it dared anyone to come near it. As though in a trance, Nicholas had walked toward the creature. When the horse ran toward him, Dougless sat up and bit her knuckles in fear.</p><p>\u201cThis one,\u201d Nicholas said to the stableman.</p><p>Dougless hurried to him. \u201cYou can\u2019t really think of riding that horse. There are lots of horses here; why don\u2019t you pick one of them?\u201d</p><p>But nothing anyone could say would change Nicholas\u2019s mind. The owner of the stables came into the yard, and he seemed to think it would be a great joke to see Nicholas break his neck. Dougless knew that in America there\u2019d be talk of insurance, but not in England. A groom got a rope around the stallion\u2019s neck, then led it into a stall, where another groom saddled it. Finally, the horse was led into a cobbled courtyard and the reins were gleefully handed to Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cI never seen nobody ride like that,\u201d one of the grooms said as soon as Nicholas had mounted and pulled the horse under control. \u201cHe ride a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d Dougless answered. \u201cHe\u2019ll get on a horse before he\u2019ll get in a car. In fact, he\u2019s spent much more of his life on a horse than in a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust have,\u201d the groom mumbled, watching Nicholas with awe.</p><p>\u201cYou are ready?\u201d Nicholas asked Dougless.</p><p>She mounted her sedate mare and followed him as he took off. Never had she seen a happier man, and it struck Dougless afresh how different the modern world must be from what he knew. He and the horse fit together as one being, as though he\u2019d become a centaur.</p><p>Rural England is full of footpaths and horse trails, and Nicholas went galloping down one of them as though he\u2019d been down it a thousand times\u2014which he probably had, Dougless thought. She called out to him that maybe he should ask directions, but then she doubted if someone had moved Goshawk Hall in the last few hundred years.</p><p>She had trouble keeping up with him, lost him repeatedly, and once he returned for her. She had stopped at a crossroads and was looking at the ground for his tracks. When he saw her, he was very interested in what she was doing. Dougless, trying her best to control her mare, who was reacting to the aggressive nearness of Nicholas\u2019s stallion, told him she\u2019d buy him some Louis L\u2019Amour books and read to him about tracking. Laughing, he pointed the way to her, then left in a flurry of mud and leaves.</p><p>At last she reached an open gate with a small brass plaque that said, \u201cGoshawk Hall.\u201d She rode down the drive to see an enormous, rectangular fortress of a house set amid acres of beautiful, rolling gardens.</p><p>Dougless felt a bit embarrassed to be riding up to this house uninvited, but Nicholas was there, already off his horse and walking toward a tall, grubby-looking man on his hands and knees in a bed of petunias.</p><p>Gratefully dismounting, Dougless took her horse\u2019s reins and ran after him. \u201cDon\u2019t you think we should knock on the front door first?\u201d Dougless asked when she reached him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask for Mr. Harewood and tell him we\u2019d like to see the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are on my ground now,\u201d he said over his shoulder as he walked toward the gardener.</p><p>\u201cNicholas!\u201d she hissed at him.</p><p>\u201cHarewood?\u201d Nicholas said to the man on his knees in the flower bed.</p><p>Turning, the tall man looked up at Nicholas. He had blue eyes and blond hair that was now turning gray, and his face had the smooth, pink complexion of a baby\u2019s. He also didn\u2019t look especially intelligent. \u201cAh, yes. Do I know you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas Stafford of Thornwyck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d the man said as he stood up, not bothering to dust off his dirty old trousers. \u201cNot the Staffords with that rogue son who got himself tried for treason?\u201d</p><p>Dougless thought the man could have been speaking of something that happened last year.</p><p>\u201cThe same,\u201d Nicholas said, his back straight.</p><p>Harewood looked from him to his horse. Nicholas was wearing a very expensive riding outfit with tall, shiny black boots, and Dougless suddenly felt grubby in her Levi\u2019s, cotton shirt, and Nikes. \u201cYou ride that?\u201d Harewood asked.</p><p>\u201cI did. I hear you have some papers on my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, we found them when a wall fell down,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cLooks like somebody hid them. Come in and we\u2019ll have some tea and see if we can find the papers. I think Arabella has them.\u201d</p><p>Dougless started to follow them, but Nicholas, without looking at her, dropped the reins of his horse into her hand, then calmly strode off with Lord Harewood.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d she said as she started after the men, leading the horses behind her. But when Nicholas\u2019s stallion started prancing, Dougless looked back at the animal. It was looking at her with a wild-eyed expression, as though it meant to do something bad. Dougless had had enough of men\u2014any kind of man! \u201cJust try it,\u201d she warned, and the horse stopped prancing.</p><p>Now what do I do, she wondered. If she was supposed to be Nicholas\u2019s secretary and she was supposed to find out what secrets may or may not be in the papers, why was she standing here holding the horses?</p><p>\u201cShould I rub them down, your lordship?\u201d she muttered as she started walking toward the back of the house. Maybe there was a stables where she could get rid of the animals.</p><p>There were half a dozen buildings in the back of the house, so Dougless headed toward one that looked as though it might be a stables. She was nearly there when a horse and rider came tearing past her. The horse was as large and as mean-looking as Nicholas\u2019s stallion (it was probably a stallion too, but Dougless always thought it was rude to look) and on top of it was a stunning woman. She looked like what all women wanted to grow up to look like: tall, slim-hipped, long, long legs, an aristocratic face, big br**sts, a straight-backed carriage that would make a piece of steel envious. She had on English riding breeches that could have been painted on, and her dark hair was pulled back in a severe bun, but that only emphasized the striking features of her beautiful face.</p><p>The woman halted her horse, then jerked on the reins and turned it around. \u201cWhose horse is that?\u201d she demanded in a voice that Dougless knew men would love: deep, throaty, husky, and powerful. Let me guess, Dougless thought, this is the great-great-great-etcetera-granddaughter of Arabella-on-the-table. Just my luck.</p><p>\u201cNicholas Stafford\u2019s,\u201d Dougless said.</p><p>The woman\u2019s face turned pale\u2014which made her lips redder, and her eyes even darker. \u201cWas that meant to amuse me?\u201d she asked, glaring down at Dougless.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a descendant of the Nicholas Stafford, if that\u2019s what you mean,\u201d Dougless answered. Dougless tried to imagine how an American family would react if someone mentioned the name of an Elizabethan-era ancestor. They\u2019d have no idea whom she was talking about, but these people acted as though Nicholas had been gone only a couple of years. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The woman dismounted beautifully, then tossed Dougless the reins. \u201cRub him down,\u201d she said as she started toward the house.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t hold my breath,\u201d Dougless muttered. She now held three horses, two of whom looked as though they liked to kill small females before breakfast. She didn\u2019t dare look at the horses but kept walking toward the stables.</p><p>An older man, sitting in the sun, drinking a mug of tea and reading a newspaper, did a double take when he saw her.</p><p>Slowly, cautiously, he rose. \u201cJust be quiet, miss,\u201d he said. \u201cStand very still and I\u2019ll take both of \u2019em.\u201d</p> <p>Dougless didn\u2019t dare move, as the man was moving toward her with the stealth that one would use when approaching a wounded tiger. Slowly, he stuck out his hand, not wanting to get too near, and took the reins to one of the stallions. Cautiously, he led the horse away from her and toward the stables. Moments later he repeated his performance as he took Nicholas\u2019s stallion away.</p><p>When the man returned, he removed his cap and wiped the sweat from his brow. \u201cHow did you get Lady Arabella\u2019s horse and Sugar together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stud from the Dennison\u2019s stables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSugar. Great joke. He should be named Enemy of the People. So that was Lady Arabella?\u201d she asked as she looked back at the house and pretended she hadn\u2019t guessed who the woman was. \u201cSo how do I get into the house? I\u2019m supposed to be . . . helping.\u201d</p> <p>When the man looked Dougless up and down, she knew her American clothes and her accent were about four strikes against her.</p><p>\u201cThat door there\u2019s the kitchen entrance.\u201d</p><p>Dougless handed him the reins to her docile mare, thanked him, and went off muttering. \u201cThe kitchen entrance. Should I bob a curtsey to the cook and ask for employment as a scullery maid? Wait until I see Nicholas! We\u2019ll settle a few things right away. I am not his horse tender.\u201d</p><p>When she knocked on the back door, a man answered, and when she asked for Nicholas, he led her into the kitchen. It was an enormous room, fitted out with new appliances, but in the center of the room was a vast table that had probably been there since William the Conqueror arrived. All five of the people in the kitchen stopped working and stared at her. \u201cJust passing through,\u201d she said. \u201cMy, ah . . . employer, he, ah, needs me.\u201d She smiled weakly. Too bad I\u2019m going to kill him, she thought, and imagined the lecture she was going to give him on modern equality.</p><p>The man she was following\u2014who didn\u2019t speak to her\u2014led her through several storage rooms for the kitchen, with everyone she saw stopping and staring at her. Nicholas is going to look forward to his execution when I finish with him, Dougless thought.</p><p>The man didn\u2019t stop until they were at the entrance hall, a big round room with magnificent staircases going up both sides, portraits hanging everywhere. Lord Harewood, Nicholas, and the dashing Lady Arabella were standing close together, looking as though they were old friends. Arabella, if possible, looked even better now than she had when Dougless had first seen her, and her beautiful eyes were practically eating up Nicholas.</p> <p>\u201cYou have joined us,\u201d Nicholas said when he saw Dougless, acting as though she\u2019d been out taking the air. \u201cMy secretary must stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you?\u201d Arabella said as she looked down her nose at Dougless. Dougless knew how a grape must feel when it was being made into a raisin.</p><p>\u201cA place must be made for her,\u201d Nicholas clarified, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI think we can find room,\u201d Arabella said.</p><p>\u201cWhere? In the trash compactor?\u201d Dougless said under her breath.</p><p>Nicholas clamped down on her shoulder painfully. \u201cAmerican,\u201d he said, as though that explained everything. \u201cWe will be here for tea,\u201d he said; then before Dougless could say another word, he pushed her out the front door before him. He seemed to know exactly where the stables were because he headed toward them.</p><p>Dougless had to hurry to keep up with his long strides. There were sometimes disadvantages to being five feet three inches tall. \u201cWhat have you done now?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre we staying here for the weekend? You didn\u2019t tell them you were from the sixteenth century, did you? And where do get off calling me an American in that tone?\u201d</p><p>He stopped on the gravel path. \u201cWhat do you have to wear to dinner? They dress for dinner.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with what I have on?\u201d she said with a smirk.</p><p>Turning, he started walking again.</p><p>\u201cThink Arabella will dress? Something with a cle**age to the floor, I\u2019ll bet.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas glanced over his shoulder, a smile on his face. \u201cWhat is a trash com . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompactor,\u201d she filled in, then explained it to him. His laugh floated back to her.</p><p>At the stables two grooms stayed well back while Nicholas mounted Sugar. \u201cHad I grooms that cowardly, I would have flogged them,\u201d Nicholas mumbled.</p><p>Dougless couldn\u2019t get a word of information out of Nicholas as they rode back to the rental stables. Thankfully, a man at the stables gave them a ride back to Thornwyck Castle, but he and Nicholas talked nonstop about horses, so Dougless couldn\u2019t ask about what Nicholas had found out.</p><p>It was lunchtime at the hotel when they returned, and Nicholas, still sweaty, went straight into the dining room, where he ordered three entrees and a bottle of wine.</p><p>Only when the wine had been poured did he speak. \u201cWhat would you know of me?\u201d he asked, his eyes twinkling. Obviously, he\u2019d been well aware that she was drowning in curiosity.</p><p>Her first thought was to not give him the satisfaction of asking him anything. Instead, she\u2019d blast him about the way he\u2019d treated her. But, in the end, her curiosity won. \u201cWho? How? What? When?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cA woman without guile.\u201d</p><p>As the food began to arrive, he told her how Dickie Harewood was the same, not too bright, wanting only to hunt and tend to his gardens. \u201cHis gardens are not near as good as mine,\u201d Nicholas said.</p><p>\u201cStop bragging and go on.\u201d She dug into her plate of roast beef. English beef was one of the great wonders of the earth: tender, succulent, cooked perfectly.</p><p>Two months ago workmen were repairing the roof of Goshawk Hall and it seemed their hammering had knocked out a piece of a wall. \u201cThey do not build today as well as they should,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cIn my houses\u2014\u201d</p><p>He broke off at a look from Dougless. Inside the wall was a trunk full of papers, and when they were examined, they were found to be the letters of Lady Margaret Stafford.</p><p>Dougless leaned back against her chair. \u201cThat\u2019s wonderful! And now we\u2019re invited to their house to read them. Oh, Colin, you are beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s eyes widened at the name she\u2019d called him, but he did not comment. \u201cThere are problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of problems? No, let me guess. In exchange, Lady Arabella wants you served on a platter to her every morning with her orange juice.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas nearly choked on his wine. \u201cYour language, madam,\u201d he said primly.</p><p>\u201cAm I right or wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncorrect. Lady Arabella is authoring a book on . . .\u201d When he turned away, Dougless wasn\u2019t sure, but she thought his face was turning pink.</p><p>\u201cOn you?\u201d she gasped.</p><p>He looked back at his food but not at her. \u201cIt concerns the man she believes to be my ancestor. She has, ah, heard the stories of . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf you two on the table.\u201d Dougless grimaced. \u201cGreat, now she wants to repeat history. Is she going to let you see the documents or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe cannot. She has signed a contract with a physician.\u201d</p><p>Dougless had to figure that one out. A physician? Was she ill? No, a doctor. \u201cNot the doctor in the magazine? What was his name? Dr. Something Hamilton. No, Hamilton something. That guy?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas nodded. \u201cHe arrived but yesterday. He hopes to gain something by clearing my name, but I do not know what. Arabella says the book will take years. I do not believe I can wait that long. Your world costs too much.\u201d</p><p>Dougless knew from her father\u2019s career how important it was to get published. To the outside world it might not seem important to solve an Elizabethan mystery, but to a scholar, especially a young man just starting out, a book with new information could mean the difference between tenure or not, or between getting a teaching position at a large, well-paid school or at a small community college.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, \u201cDr. Whatever is there, and he\u2019s sworn your Arabella to secrecy, so you\u2019re not going to be given access to the papers. Yet it seems that we\u2019re invited as houseguests anyway.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas smiled over his wineglass. \u201cI have persuaded Arabella to tell me what she knows of me. I hope I can persuade her to tell me all. And you\u201d\u2014he fixed Dougless with a look\u2014\u201cyou are to talk to this physician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a Ph.D., not a physician and . . . What! Wait a minute, are you saying what I think you are? I am not, under any circumstances, going to play up to some history nut to help you out. I signed on as a secretary, not as a . . . What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas had taken her hand in both of his and was kissing her fingertips one by one.</p><p>\u201cStop that! People are looking.\u201d Dougless\u2019s shoes came off her feet. Nicholas\u2019s lips traveled up her arm until they reached the sensitive little spot on her inner elbow. Dougless was sinking down in the chair.</p><p>\u201cAll right!\u201d she said. \u201cYou win! Stop that!\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her through his lashes. \u201cYou will help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said as he kissed her arm again.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, then dropped her arm so that it landed in her dirty plate. \u201cNow we must pack.\u201d</p><p>Dougless, grimacing, mopped up her arm and ran after him. \u201cIs that how you\u2019re going to persuade Arabella?\u201d she called after him, then stopped as she saw the other diners staring at her. Dougless gave a crooked smile of apology and ran from the room.</p><p>In their suite, Dougless saw a different Nicholas. He was very concerned that his clothes weren\u2019t correct. He held up a gorgeous linen shirt and said, \u201cIt needs pluming up.\u201d</p><p>Dougless looked at her own meager wardrobe and felt like crying. A weekend at an English lord\u2019s estate, where they dress for dinner, and she had nothing but serviceable wool. She wished she had her mother\u2019s white gown, the one with the pearls, or the red one with\u2014</p><p>Halting, she thought for a moment. Then she smiled. And the next minute she was on the phone to her sister Elizabeth in Maine.</p><p>\u201cYou want me to send you two of Mother\u2019s best gowns?\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cShe will kill both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElizabeth,\u201d Dougless said firmly. \u201cI take full responsibility. Just send them NOW. Overnight mail. Got a pencil?\u201d She gave Elizabeth the address at Goshawk Hall.</p><p>\u201cDougless, what\u2019s going on? First I get a frantic-sounding call from you where you won\u2019t tell me anything, and now you want me to ransack Mother\u2019s closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing much. How\u2019s your paper coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s making me crazy. And if that weren\u2019t bad enough, I have stopped up drains. A plumber is coming today. Dougless, are you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Good luck with your paper and your plumber. Bye.\u201d</p><p>Dougless packed her suitcase, then Nicholas\u2019s\u2014it was one of those things he wouldn\u2019t consider doing for himself\u2014then she called a taxi. There was no suitcase large enough to hold his armor, so it was put into the biggest shopping bag.</p><p>When they arrived at Goshawk Hall, Arabella literally met Nicholas with open arms. \u201cCome inside, darling,\u201d she purred, her hands all over him. \u201cI feel we already know one another. After all, our ancestors were very friendly. Who are we to be any different?\u201d She ushered him inside, leaving Dougless with a half-dozen or so suitcases at her feet.</p><p>\u201cWho are we to be any different?\u201d she mocked in a falsetto voice as she paid the cab driver.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take Dougless five minutes to learn that she was not considered a houseguest but a servant, and not a very welcome one at that. A man ushered her\u2014Dougless carrying her own suitcases\u2014to a small, barren, cold room not far from the kitchen. Feeling like a governess in a gothic, neither servant nor family, she unpacked and hung her clothes in a grubby little wardrobe. Looking about the ugly little room, she felt martyred. Here she was doing this to help some guy save his life and his family name and she was never even going to be able to tell anyone about it.</p><p>She left the room and went into the kitchen to find the big room empty, but tea for two had been set up at one end of the worktable.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d said a large woman with graying hair.</p><p>Minutes later, Dougless was sitting at the table having tea with the woman. Mrs. Anderson was the cook and the most wonderful gossip Dougless had ever met. There wasn\u2019t a thing the woman didn\u2019t know or was unwilling to tell. She wanted to know why Dougless was there and who Lord Stafford was, and in return she wanted to tell Dougless everything. Dougless obliged with a complicated web of lies that she prayed she\u2019d be able to remember.</p><p>An hour later the other servants began filtering back into the kitchen, and Dougless could see they wanted her to leave so Mrs. Anderson could tell them all the juicy news.</p><p>Upon leaving the kitchen, Dougless went in search of Nicholas. She found him outside with Arabella under a grape arbor, the two of them cozied up like nesting birds.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Dougless said loudly, \u201cyou wanted to dictate letters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis lordship is busy at the moment,\u201d Arabella said, glaring. \u201cHe will attend to business on Monday. In the library are notes of mine that you may type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis lordship is\u2014\u201d Dougless had intended to say \u201cmy employer, not you,\u201d but Nicholas interrupted her.</p><p>\u201cYes, Miss Montgomery, perhaps you can help Lady Arabella.\u201d</p><p>Dougless started to tell him what she thought of him, but his eyes were pleading with her to be obedient. In spite of what she knew she should do, that is, tell them both what she thought of them, she turned and went back into the house. It wasn\u2019t any of her business, she thought. It didn\u2019t matter to her what he did with other women. Of course she might point out to him that his foolishness with Arabella in the past had left generations of people laughing at him, and now it looked as though he was about to repeat himself. Yes, she might bring herself to point out that one small fact to him. And, also, if he was so madly in love with his wife, why was he snuggling up with the overendowed Arabella? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It took Dougless a while to find the library, and when she did, she was pleased to see that it looked just as she thought a library in one of these big, grand houses should look: leather-bound books, leather chairs, dark green walls, oak doors. She was looking around the room so intently that she didn\u2019t at first see the man standing in front of the bookcases, reading a book. She saw him before he saw her, and instantly, she knew who he was. Only a man like her father, a man who had dedicated his life to learning, could be so absorbed in a book that he was oblivious of all else. He was young, blond, broad-shouldered, slim-hipped, and he looked as though he worked out often. Even with his face tipped down, Dougless could see that he was very good looking, not divine, as Nicholas was, but good enough to set a few hearts to beating quickly. She also took in the fact that he was only about five feet six inches tall. However, it had been Dougless\u2019s experience that short, handsome men were as vain as bantam roosters, and they loved short, pretty females such as Dougless.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said.</p><p>The man glanced up from his book, down, then up again, and ended by staring at her with unabashed interest. He put his book away and came forward with his hand outstretched. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Hamilton Nolman.\u201d</p><p>Dougless took his hand. Blue eyes, perfect teeth. What a very interesting man, she thought. \u201cI\u2019m Dougless Montgomery, and you are an American.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe same as you,\u201d he said, and there was an immediate bond between them. He stepped closer. \u201cCan you believe this place?\u201d he said as he glanced around the room.</p><p>\u201cNever. Or the people. Lady Arabella sent me in here to type and I don\u2019t even work for her.\u201d</p><p>Hamilton laughed. \u201cShe\u2019ll have you scrubbing toilets before long. She doesn\u2019t allow pretty women near her. All the maids working here are dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t noticed.\u201d She looked at him. \u201cAren\u2019t you the doctor who\u2019s working on the Stafford papers? The ones that fell out of the wall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat must have been exciting,\u201d Dougless said, wide-eyed, trying to look as young and innocent, and as dumb, as possible. \u201cI heard the papers contained secret information. Is that true, Dr. Nolman?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled in a fatherly way. \u201cPlease, call me Lee. It has been rather exciting, although I\u2019m just now getting into the papers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all about some man who was about to be beheaded, aren\u2019t they? I . . .\u201d She lowered her eyes and her voice. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t possibly tell me about the papers, would you?\u201d</p><p>She watched him puff out his chest in pride; then the next minute they were seated and he was telling her about how he\u2019d come to have the job and what had happened since he\u2019d arrived. In spite of the fact that he seemed a tiny bit too full of himself, she found herself liking him. Wouldn\u2019t her father love having a son-in-law who was interested in medieval history?</p><p>Wait a minute, Dougless, she cautioned herself. You\u2019re swearing off men, remember? She was listening so intently to Lee that she didn\u2019t hear Nicholas enter the room.</p><p>\u201cMiss Montgomery!\u201d Nicholas said so loudly that her arm fell out from under her chin and she nearly fell off the chair. \u201cAre my letters typed?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTyping?\u201d she asked. \u201cOh, Ni . . . Ah, your lordship, I\u2019d like you to meet Dr. Hamilton Nolman, he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>Arrogantly, Nicholas walked past Dr. Nolman, ignoring the doctor\u2019s outstretched hand, as he went to the window. \u201cLeave us,\u201d Nicholas said over his shoulder.</p><p>Lee wiggled his eyebrows at Dougless, picked up his books, and left the room, shutting the heavy doors behind him.</p><p>\u201cJust who do you think you are?\u201d Dougless asked. \u201cYou\u2019re no longer some sixteenth-century lord and master now. You can\u2019t just dismiss people like that. And, besides, what do you know about typing?\u201d</p><p>When Nicholas turned to look at her, she could tell by his expression that he had no idea what she was talking about. \u201cYou were very close to that small man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was . . . ?\u201d Dougless trailed off. Was that jealousy in his voice? She walked over to the big oak desk. \u201cHe\u2019s very good looking, isn\u2019t he? And a scholar at his age, imagine. How\u2019s Arabella doing? Told her about your wife yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat conversation did you have with that man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual,\u201d she said, running her finger along the desk. \u201cHe told me I was pretty, that sort of thing.\u201d</p> <p>When she looked back at Nicholas, she saw his face had an expression of controlled rage. Her heart swelled with happiness. Revenge, she thought, can be sweet. \u201cI did find out some things though. Lee\u2014that\u2019s Dr. Nolman\u2014hasn\u2019t really read much of the papers yet. It seems that your Arabella took her time in choosing from the many scholars who asked to look at the papers. From what I gather, she chose the best-looking man from the photographs she insisted that the applicants send. Sort of a male beauty contest. I hear she threw away the women\u2019s photos. Pure heterosexual, our lovely Arabella is. Lee said she was awfully disappointed that he turned out to be shorter than she is. He said Arabella took one look at him and said, \u2018I thought all Americans were tall.\u2019 Lee, thankfully, seems to have his ego intact, because he just laughed. He pretty much thinks Arabella is a jerk. Oh, sorry, I\u2019m forgetting how much you adore her.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s face was still enraged, and Dougless gave him her biggest smile. \u201cHow is Arabella?\u201d she asked sweetly.</p><p>Nicholas glared at her for a moment, then his eyes changed. Turning, he pointed at an old oak table standing against a wall. \u201cThat, madam, is the true table.\u201d With a smug little smile, he left the room.</p><p>With her fists clenched, Dougless went over to the table and gave it a good, hard kick. Hobbling about, holding her toe, she cursed all men.</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>Dinner was to be served at eight, and as Dougless dressed in her museum-visiting clothes, she hoped Elizabeth would send the gowns to her as soon as possible. But as eight drew near and no one summoned her to dinner, she wondered what was going on. She knew the servants had eaten earlier and she hadn\u2019t been invited to eat with them, so she assumed she was to eat with the family. Sitting in her room, she waited.</p><p>At eight-fifteen, a man came to her and told her to follow him. She was led through the maze of rooms to a narrow dining room with a big fireplace and a table long enough to use for skateboarding. Arabella, her father, Nicholas, and Lee were already seated. Arabella, as Dougless had expected, was wearing a dress so low cut it pretty much left her bare from the waist up. She was showing more than Dougless even possessed.</p><p>As unobtrusively as possible, Dougless slipped into a chair next to Lee that a servant held out for her.</p><p>\u201cYour boss wouldn\u2019t eat until you were here,\u201d Lee whispered as the first course was served. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on between you two? Is he a descendant of the Nicholas Stafford, the one that was almost beheaded?\u201d</p><p>Dougless gave Lee the same story she had given the cook, a story she was sure that by now every servant probably knew, that Nicholas was indeed a descendant, and he very much wanted to clear his ancestor\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I had ol\u2019 Arabella sign a contract,\u201d Lee said, \u201cbecause if he\u2019d asked first, I think she would have given him exclusive access to the papers. Look at the two of them. With the way she\u2019s looking at him, they just might go to it on the table\u2014again.\u201d</p><p>Dougless choked on her salmon so badly, she had to drink half a glass of water to clear her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this boss to you? You two aren\u2019t . . . ? You know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Dougless said as she watched Nicholas lean over Arabella, his eyes looking down her dress. Looking down to see what? Dougless thought. There weren\u2019t but a couple of inches that she wasn\u2019t exposing for everyone in the house to see.</p><p>When Nicholas glanced up at her, Dougless moved a little nearer Lee. \u201cI was thinking, Lee, since my boss seems to be so busy, maybe you need a secretary for the weekend. My father is a professor of medieval history, so I\u2019ve had some experience with helping him research.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMontgomery,\u201d Lee said slowly; then his eyes lit up. \u201cNot Adam Montgomery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI once heard him present a brilliant paper on thirteenth-century economics. So, he\u2019s your father. Maybe I could use a little help.\u201d</p><p>Dougless could almost read his mind. Adam Montgomery would be in a position to help a struggling young professor. But Dougless didn\u2019t mind. Wasn\u2019t ambition good? Besides, she would let Lee believe whatever he wanted if it helped her find out what secret Nicholas\u2019s mother knew.</p><p>\u201cThe trunk is in my room,\u201d Lee was saying, and his glances were decidedly warmer since finding out who her father was. \u201cMaybe after dinner you\u2019d like to, ah . . . visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d Dougless said as she envisioned an evening spent running around a table trying to escape his advances. At the thought of a table, she glanced at Nicholas and saw he was glaring at her. Smiling, she lifted her wineglass to him in salute, then took a deep drink. Nicholas turned away, glowering.</p><p>After dinner, Dougless went back to her room to get her notebook and a few supplies as well as her handbag. She thought she might as well be prepared for a long night spent rummaging through four-hundred-year-old documents.</p><p>Twice she got lost in the house as she turned wrong corners in her search for Lee\u2019s room. She halted outside an open door when she heard Arabella\u2019s seductive voice coming from inside. \u201cBut, darling, I get so frightened when I\u2019m alone at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly,\u201d Dougless heard Nicholas say, \u201cI would have thought you past such childish fears.\u201d</p><p>Dougless rolled her eyes skyward.</p><p>\u201cHere, let me refill your glass,\u201d Arabella said. \u201cAnd then I\u2019d like to show you something.\u201d Her voice lowered. \u201cIn my room.\u201d</p><p>Dougless grimaced. Stupid man! According to the cook, Arabella showed everything in her room to every male who visited Goshawk Hall. With a malicious little smile, Dougless began looking through her handbag. Smiling brightly, she walked into the parlor. Every light except one dim one was off, Arabella was pouring a water glass full of bourbon, and Nicholas sat on the sofa with his shirt half open.</p><p>\u201cOh, your lordship,\u201d Dougless said briskly as she began going about the room turning on every light. \u201cHere\u2019s the calculator you wanted, but I\u2019m afraid the only one I have is solar. It will only work in a brightly lit room.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stared with interest at the small calculator she handed him, and when she began to demonstrate it, his eyes turned to saucers. \u201cOne may add?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd subtract and multiply and divide. See, here\u2019s your answer. Say you wanted to subtract this year, 1988, from 1564, the year your ancestor was accused of treason and lost his family\u2019s fortune forever, you\u2019d get a minus four hundred and twenty-four years. Four hundred and twenty-four years in which to right a wrong and keep your descendants from laughing at you\u2014at him, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d Arabella said, so angry she could barely speak, \u201cleave this room at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d Dougless said innocently. \u201cWas I disturbing the two of you? I\u2019m so awfully sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to. I was just doing my job.\u201d She started backing toward the door. \u201cPlease carry on with what you were doing.\u201d</p><p>Dougless left the room, walked down the hall a few feet, then tiptoed back to stand outside the door. She saw the shadows from the room darken.</p><p>\u201cI need light,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cThe machine does not work without light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas, for God\u2019s sake, it\u2019s only a calculator. Put it away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a most wondrous machine. What is this mark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a percent sign but I can\u2019t see what it matters now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemonstrate its function.\u201d</p><p>Dougless could hear Arabella\u2019s sigh through the walls. Smiling, quite pleased with herself, Dougless continued her search for Lee\u2019s room. He greeted her wearing, of all things, a silk smoking jacket. Dougless refrained from giggling. One look at his face and at the martini glass he held, and Dougless knew that he had no intention of talking to her about anything except why she should jump into bed with him. She took the martini he offered her, sipped it, then grimaced. She hated martinis, dry or otherwise.</p><p>Lee started by telling her how beautiful her hair was, how surprised he was to find such a stunning woman in this moldy old house, what a great dresser she was, and how little her feet were. Dougless could have yawned. Instead, when he refilled her glass, she surreptitiously took two of her stomach tranquilizers from her bag, opened the capsules, and poured them into Lee\u2019s drink. \u201cBottoms up,\u201d she said cheerfully.</p><p>While she was waiting for the pills to take effect, she showed Lee the note Nicholas had slipped under her door the night before. \u201cWhat does this say?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at it. \u201cI think I should write the translation.\u201d He took a pen and paper and wrote:</p><p>I think my selfe moch</p><p>bownden unto yow.</p><p>I am Desyrynge yo</p><p>assystance no further.</p><p>\u201cDesyrynge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeserving.\u201d</p><p>She had come close to guessing what Nicholas had written last night when he\u2019d left her, before she\u2019d found him in a tavern.</p><p>Yawning, Lee rubbed his hand over his eyes. \u201cI feel a little\u2014\u201d He yawned again.</p><p>With many apologies, he stood up, then went to the bed and stretched out \u201cfor just a minute.\u201d He was asleep instantly, and Dougless quickly went to the little wooden chest on the table near the fireplace.</p><p>The papers inside were old, yellow, and brittle, but the writing was clear, the ink not faded as modern inks faded in a mere year or two. Dougless eagerly grabbed the papers, but her heart sank as she looked at them. They were in the same kind of handwriting as the note Nicholas had slipped under her door, and she couldn\u2019t read a word.</p><p>She was bent over the papers, trying to decipher a word here and there, when suddenly the door burst open.</p><p>\u201cAh ha!\u201d Nicholas said, his sword in his hand, as he charged into the room.</p><p>When Dougless\u2019s heart settled back in place from the fright he\u2019d given her, she smiled at him. \u201cArabella finish with you?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas looked from Lee asleep on the bed to Dougless bending over the papers, and began to look embarrassed. \u201cShe was off to bed,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAlone?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas walked to the table and picked up a letter. \u201cMy mother\u2019s hand,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At the tone in his voice, Dougless forgot her jealousy. \u201cI can\u2019t read them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d he said, lifting one eyebrow. \u201cI might teach you to read. In the evenings. I believe you could learn.\u201d</p><p>Dougless laughed. \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve made your point. Now sit down and read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd him?\u201d Nicholas pointed with his sword at the sleeping Lee.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s out of it for the night.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas put his sword across the table and began to read the letter. Since Dougless could be of no help, she sat quietly and watched him. If he was so in love with his wife, why was he jealous when another man looked at her, Dougless? And why was he fooling around with Arabella?</p><p>\u201cNicholas?\u201d she said softly. \u201cHave you ever considered what would happen if you didn\u2019t return to your time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he answered, scanning a letter. \u201cI must return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if you don\u2019t? What if you stay here forever?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have been sent here to find answers. A wrong has been done my family as well as me. I have been sent here to right that wrong.\u201d</p><p>Dougless was playing with the hilt of his sword, rolling it so the jewels reflected in the table lamp. \u201cBut what if you were sent here for another reason? A reason that had nothing to do with your being accused of treason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would be that reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, but she thought, love.</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cFor this love you speak of?\u201d he asked, almost reading her mind. \u201cPerhaps God thinks as a woman and cares more for love than for honor.\u201d He was making fun of her.</p><p>\u201cFor your information, there are many people who believe God is a woman.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholas gave her a look that let her know how absurd he thought that idea was.</p><p>\u201cNo, really,\u201d Dougless said. \u201cWhat if you don\u2019t go back? What if you find out what you need to know, but you still stay here? Like say for a year or more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not,\u201d Nicholas said, but he looked up at Dougless. Four hundred years had not changed Arabella, he thought. She was the same. She still wanted one man after another in her bed, still had a heart of stone. But this girl who made him laugh, who helped him, who looked at him with big eyes that showed everything she felt, this woman could almost make him want to stay. \u201cI must return,\u201d he said sternly, then looked back at the letters.</p><p>\u201cI know that what happened to your family is fiercely important, but then it did happen a long time ago, and, all in all, everything seems to have worked out all right. Your mother married a rich man and lived out her days in luxury. It wasn\u2019t as though she were tossed out in the snow. And I know your family lost the Stafford estates, but, really, who was left to inherit them? You said you had no children, and your brother died childless, so who did you deprive? The estates went to Queen Elizabeth and she built England into a great country, so maybe your money helped your country. Maybe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCease!\u201d Nicholas said angrily. \u201cYou do not understand honor. My memory is ridiculed. Arabella says she has read about me, and your world remembers only what a clerk recorded. I know that man. He was ugly and no woman would have him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he wrote about you. Nicholas, I\u2019m sorry, but it really is done. It\u2019s over. Maybe history can\u2019t be changed. I was just wondering what you\u2019d do if you had to stay, if you weren\u2019t called back.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas didn\u2019t want to think about that. Would he tell Dougless that he\u2019d marry her and run with her to bed? He didn\u2019t want to tell her that Arabella, once so very, very appealing, was now a bore to him.</p><p>\u201cMontgomery, do you fall in love with me again?\u201d he asked, smiling at her. \u201cCome, we will take these letters to my bedchamber. I will let you make love to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrop dead,\u201d Dougless said, rising. \u201cStay here and read. I don\u2019t care what happens to you, whether you stay in the twentieth century or go back to the sixteenth century, or to the eighth, for all I care.\u201d She left the room, shutting the door so hard Lee stirred on the bed.</p><p>Falling in love with him, indeed, she thought as she made her way back to her dreadful little room. She might as well fall in love with a ghost. He had about as much substance as a ghost. And, besides, if he did stay in the twentieth century, he\u2019d be a great nuisance. Always, she\u2019d have to explain things to him. Imagine trying to teach him to drive a car! Horrendous thought. And if he did stay, what would he do? What could he do? All he seemed capable of was riding mean horses, handling a sword, and . . .</p><p>And making love to women, she thought. He seemed to be awfully good at that.</p><p>As she made her way downstairs to her dreary little room, she told herself she\u2019d be quite glad to get rid of him. His poor wife. She had a great deal to put up with. Arabella was the only one of his women Dougless knew about. There were probably hundreds of women the poor ugly little clerk had known nothing about, so the twentieth century knew nothing about all those women.</p><p>Yes, Dougless thought as she put on her nightgown, she would be well rid of him when the time came. But as she climbed into bed, she couldn\u2019t imagine not seeing Nicholas every day, not watching his delight over things she took for granted. She couldn\u2019t imagine not seeing his smile or having him tease her.</p><p>It took her a long time before she slept and when she did, she slept fitfully.</p><p>In the morning, feeling absolutely rotten, Dougless went into the kitchen and found Mrs. Anderson and another woman staring at the worktable. It was covered with opened tin cans, somewhere between twenty and thirty of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Dougless asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d the cook said. \u201cI opened a tin of pineapple, then left the room for a moment. When I returned, someone had opened all these tins.\u201d</p><p>Dougless stood frowning for a moment, then looked at Mrs. Anderson. \u201cDid anyone see you open the can of pineapple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that you mention it, there was someone here. Lord Nicholas came through to go to the stables. He stopped and spoke to me. Very nice man, that.\u201d</p><p>Dougless tried to hide her smile. Nicholas had no doubt seen the marvel of a can opener and decided to try it out. At that moment a maid came running into the kitchen carrying a vacuum cleaner hose.</p><p>\u201cI need a broom handle,\u201d the maid said, sounding as though she were about to cry. \u201cLord Nicholas asked me to show him how the Hoover worked, and he sucked up all of Lady Arabella\u2019s jewelry. I\u2019ll be discharged when she finds out.\u201d</p><p>Dougless left the kitchen feeling a great deal better than she had when she got up that morning.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know where she was supposed to eat breakfast, but she wandered into the empty dining room and found a sideboard covered with silver chafing dishes. Feeling a little defiant, she filled a plate and sat down.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Lee said, entering the room. He filled a plate and sat across from her. \u201cAh . . . sorry about last night,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess I sort of passed out. Did you see the letters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, but I couldn\u2019t read them,\u201d she said honestly, then leaned forward. \u201cHave you read enough to find out who betrayed Nicholas Stafford to the queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, heavens, yes. I found that out the first time I opened the trunk, and I have that letter hidden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she asked under her breath.</p><p>Lee opened his mouth to speak, but then Nicholas entered the room, and Lee shut up.</p><p>\u201cMontgomery,\u201d Nicholas said sternly. \u201cI would see you in the library.\u201d He turned and left the room.</p><p>Lee grunted. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him? Get out on the wrong side of Arabella\u2019s bed?\u201d</p><p>Dougless threw down her napkin, glared at Lee, then went to the library. She closed the door behind her. \u201cDo you know what you just did? Lee was about to tell me who betrayed you when you walked in and stopped him.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas had circles under his eyes, but instead of making him look bad, they made him look even more darkly romantic, rather like Heathcliff. \u201cI read the letters,\u201d he said as he sat down in a leather-upholstered chair and stared out the window. \u201cThere is no naming of who betrayed me.\u201d</p><p>Something was making him sad. Dougless went to him and put her hand on his shoulder. \u201cWhat is it? Did the letters upset you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe letters tell,\u201d he said softly, \u201cof what my mother suffered after my death. She tells of . . .\u201d He stopped, took her hand, and held on to her fingers. \u201cShe tells of the ridicule of the Stafford name.\u201d</p><p>Dougless couldn\u2019t bear the pain in his voice. Moving to the front of the chair, she knelt before him and put her hands on his knees. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out who lied about you,\u201d Dougless said. \u201cIf Lee knows, I\u2019ll find out. And when we do find out, you can return and change things. Your being here means you\u2019re being given a second chance.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her for a long moment, then cupped her face in his big hands. \u201cDo you always give hope? Do you never believe there is no hope?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m almost always optimistic. That\u2019s why I keep falling in love with thugs and hoping one of them will turn into my Knight in Shining\u2014Oh, Colin,\u201d she said, and started to pull away.</p><p>But Nicholas pulled her up from the floor and into his arms; then he kissed her. He\u2019d kissed her before, but then he\u2019d merely desired her, now he wanted more from her. Now he wanted her sweetness and her loving heart. He wanted the way she looked at him, the way she was so eager to please.</p><p>\u201cDougless,\u201d he whispered, holding her, kissing her neck.</p><p>It was when the thought crossed his mind that he didn\u2019t want to leave that he shoved her from him. \u201cGo,\u201d he murmured in the tone of a man under great stress.</p><p>Dougless stood up, but anger filled her. \u201cI don\u2019t understand you. You kiss any woman who can reach your face, you never push any of them away, but with me you act like I have some contagious disease. What is it? Do I have terminal bad breath? I\u2019m too short for you? My hair isn\u2019t the right color?\u201d</p><p>When Nicholas looked at her, all his desire for her, all his longing, was flaming in his eyes.</p><p>Dougless stepped back from him, as a person might step back from a fire that was too hot. She put her hand to her throat, and for a long moment they just looked at each other.</p><p>The door flew open and Arabella burst into the room. She was wearing what was obviously a designer-made English outdoor outfit. \u201cNicholas, where have you been?\u201d She looked from Nicholas to Dougless and back again, and she didn\u2019t seem to like what she saw.</p><p>Dougless turned away, for she could no longer bear to look in Nicholas\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d Arabella demanded. \u201cWe are waiting. The guns are loaded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuns?\u201d Dougless asked, turning around, trying to compose herself.</p><p>Arabella looked Dougless up and down, and obviously found her wanting. Tall women often seemed to feel like that about small women, Dougless thought, and was awfully glad men didn\u2019t feel the same way.</p><p>\u201cWe hunt duck,\u201d Nicholas said, but he wasn\u2019t looking at Dougless. \u201cDickie has promised to show me what a shotgun is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Dougless said, \u201cgo shoot pretty little ducks. I\u2019ll manage.\u201d Hurrying past Arabella, she ran out the door. Later, from an upstairs window, she looked down on the courtyard as Nicholas got into a Land Rover and Arabella drove him away.</p><p>Turning away, Dougless realized that she had nothing to do. She didn\u2019t feel free to explore Arabella\u2019s house, and she didn\u2019t want to walk in Arabella\u2019s gardens. She asked a passing servant where Lee was, but was told that he was locked in his room with the letters and had left instructions that he was not to be disturbed.</p><p>\u201cBut he left a book for you in the library,\u201d the servant said.</p><p>Dougless went back to the library and there on the desk was a small volume with a note attached. \u201cThought you might enjoy this. Lee,\u201d the note read. She picked up the book.</p><p>At first sight she knew what it was: it was the diary of John Wilfred, the ugly little clerk who wrote of Nicholas and Arabella-on-the table. The forward said the book had been found hidden in a cubbyhole behind a wall when one of Nicholas\u2019s houses had been torn down in the nineteen fifties.</p><p>Dougless took the book and settled down on a big sofa to read it. Within twenty pages she knew it was the diary of a lovesick young man\u2014and he loved Nicholas\u2019s wife, Lettice. According to John Wilfred, his mistress could do no wrong and his master no right. Pages that listed Nicholas\u2019s shortcomings were followed by pages listing Lettice\u2019s glories. According to this drooling clerk, Lettice was beautiful beyond pearls, wise, virtuous, kind, talented . . . On and on he went, until Dougless wanted to throw up.</p><p>The clerk had nothing good to say about Nicholas. According to the book, Nicholas spent his time fornicating, blaspheming, and making the lives of everyone around him hell. Other than the snide, spiteful story about Arabella and the table, there were no specific stories about what Nicholas had done to deserve the animosity of all (if Wilfred was to be believed) his household.</p><p>When Dougless finished the book, she slammed it shut. Because of the false accusation of treason against Nicholas, his estates had been destroyed, and with them the true story of his life. Lost to the future was the true story of how he\u2019d managed the estates owned by his brother and how he\u2019d designed a beautiful mansion. All that was left of him were the spiteful yearnings of a whining man. Yet people today believed this.</p><p>She stood up, her anger making her fists clench. Nicholas was right: he had to return to his own time to right the wrong done him. She\u2019d tell him about the book, and when he returned to the sixteenth century, he could kick ol\u2019 John Wilfred out of his house. Or, Dougless thought, smiling, he could send the ugly little clerk off with the perfect Lettice.</p><p>Taking the book, Dougless left the library and asked a servant where Lord Nicholas\u2019s room was. She thought she\u2019d leave the book for him to see. He was beginning to be able to read modern print now, and she was sure he\u2019d have enough interest to read this book.</p><p>His room was next to one that a maid said was Lady Arabella\u2019s. It would be, Dougless thought angrily.</p><p>Once in his room, her anger left her. It was done in shades of blue, with a four-poster bed draped with rich blue silk. In the bathroom were Nicholas\u2019s toiletries, all the things she\u2019d chosen for him. Putting out her hand, she touched the shaving cream, the toothpaste, and his razor.</p><p>Quite suddenly, it hit her how much she missed him. Since he\u2019d appeared they\u2019d been together almost constantly. They\u2019d shared a bedroom and a bathroom; they\u2019d shared meals and jokes. Turning, she looked at the tub, saw that there was no showerhead above it, and wondered how he was dealing with the lack of a shower. Were there other things in his room that he didn\u2019t understand yet had no one to ask about? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she walked back into the bedroom, she smiled as she remembered the way he would come out of the bathroom wearing nothing but a towel, his hair clean and wet. Before they\u2019d come to Goshawk Hall, they\u2019d been intimate in such a pleasant way. She\u2019d shared meals with him, kissed him on the forehead goodnight, and even washed out his underwear in the basin. They\u2019d laughed together, talked together, shared together.</p><p>There was a Time magazine on the bedside table, and on impulse she pulled open the table drawer. Inside was a little pencil sharpener and three pencils, two of which were now only an inch long, and a stapler and two pieces of paper with about fifty staples in them. There was a toy friction car on top of a colored brochure for Aston Martin cars, and beneath that was the current issue of Playboy magazine. Smiling, she closed the drawer.</p><p>She walked toward the window and looked out across the rolling lawns to the trees beyond. It was odd how she had lived with Robert for over a year and had believed herself to be madly in love with him, but when she thought of her life with him, she wondered if she\u2019d ever been as intimate with Robert as she had with Nicholas. She\u2019d spent a lot of her time making an effort to please Robert. But Nicholas was so easy to be with. He never complained when she squeezed the toothpaste tube in the middle. He never whined about how she hadn\u2019t made everything absolutely perfect.</p><p>In fact, Nicholas seemed to like her just as she was. In fact, he seemed to accept what was, whether in people or things, and he found joy in them. Dougless thought of all the dates she\u2019d been on with modern men and how they\u2019d complained about everything: the wine wasn\u2019t right, the service was slow, the movie had no deeper meaning. But Nicholas, faced with insurmountable problems, found joy in things like a can opener.</p> <p>She wondered how Robert would react if he\u2019d suddenly found himself-in the sixteenth century. No doubt he\u2019d start demanding this and demanding that, and whining when it wasn\u2019t given to him. She wondered if Elizabethan men were like the cowboys of old and hanged men who were particularly bothersome.</p><p>She leaned her head against the cool glass. When would Nicholas leave this century? When he found out who had betrayed him? If Lee mentioned the name at dinner, would Nicholas instantly disappear in a puff of smoke?</p><p>It\u2019s almost over, she thought, and suddenly felt her heart yearning for him. How would she deal with never seeing him again? She could barely stand not seeing him for one whole day, so how was she to live the rest of her life without him?</p><p>Please come back, she thought. We have so little time left. Tomorrow you might be gone, and I don\u2019t want to miss this time with you. Don\u2019t spend this little bit of time we have left with Arabella.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she tightened her whole body as she wished for him to return.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll come back,\u201d she whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll make you an American lunch: fried chicken, potato salad, deviled eggs and a chocolate cake. While I\u2019m cooking, you can . . .\u201d She thought. \u201cYou can look at plastic wrap and aluminum foil and Tupperware\u2014if they have it in England. Please, please, please return, Nicholas.\u201d</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s head came up. Arabella\u2019s arms were about his neck, her abundant br**sts pressed against his bare chest. They were in a private glade where he and a past Arabella had spent an energetic afternoon. But today Nicholas had little interest in the woman. She had told him she wanted to discuss what she\u2019d found out about his ancestor. She\u2019d said she had new information, facts that had never been published before.</p><p>Her words were a lure to him, and to find out what she knew, he\u2019d pay any price, so he\u2019d followed her to the secluded spot.</p><p>Arabella pulled Nicholas\u2019s head back down.</p><p>\u201cDo you hear it?\u201d Nicholas asked.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing, darling,\u201d Arabella whispered. \u201cI hear only you.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas pulled away from her. \u201cI must go.\u201d</p><p>Seeing anger flood her haughty face, Nicholas knew he did not want to enrage her. \u201cSomeone comes,\u201d he said, \u201cand you are too lovely to share with the prying eyes of anyone. I would keep your beauties to myself.\u201d</p><p>This seemed to mollify her enough that she began fastening her clothes. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a man who was more of a gentleman than you. Tonight then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight,\u201d he said, then left her.</p><p>For the most part the hunters had driven Land Rovers, but there were a half dozen horses tied near the cars. Nicholas took the best one, rode it back to the house, then mounted the stairs two at a time. He flung open the door to his bedroom.</p><p>Dougless wasn\u2019t surprised, really, when Nicholas appeared in the doorway.</p><p>For a moment, he stood there staring at her. Her face and her body showed her wanting of him. It was the most difficult thing Nicholas had ever done, but he looked away. He could not, would not, touch her. If he did . . . If he did, he was not sure he would want to return to his own time.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want of me?\u201d he asked harshly.</p><p>\u201cI want you?\u201d she asked, angry. She\u2019d seen the way he\u2019d turned away from her. \u201cIt looks as though someone else wanted you, not me.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas looked up at the mirror in the wardrobe door and saw that his shirt was buttoned wrong. \u201cThe guns are good,\u201d he said, refastening his shirt. \u201cWith those we could beat the Spanish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEngland beats everyone and without modern guns. Next thing, you\u2019ll be telling me you want bombs to take back with you. Did the guns unbutton your shirt?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her in the mirror. \u201cYour jealousy brightens your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Dougless\u2019s anger dissolved. \u201cCad!\u201d she said. \u201cDid it ever occur to you that you\u2019re making a fool of yourself a second time around? History has loved the story of you and Arabella, and now here you are doing it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows what I do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet she does,\u201d Dougless muttered. \u201cProbably more experienced.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas chucked her under the chin. \u201cI doubt so. Is that food I smell? I am hungry.\u201d</p><p>Dougless smiled. \u201cI promised you an American lunch. Come on, let\u2019s go see Mrs. Anderson.\u201d</p><p>They walked arm in arm to the kitchen. The hunters had taken lunch with them in baskets, so the kitchen was not being used now except for a pudding steaming on the back burner of the Aga.</p><p>After getting Mrs. Anderson\u2019s permission, Dougless set to work, putting potatoes and eggs on to boil, then starting on the cake, but she decided on chewy, pecan-filled brownies instead. Nicholas sat at the big table and experimented with plastic wrap and aluminum foil and opened and closed plastic containers until Dougless said the \u201cwhooshing\u201d sound was driving her crazy, so she gave him eggs and potatoes to peel. He wouldn\u2019t chop onions, though.</p><p>\u201cDid you help Lettice cook?\u201d she asked, trying to sound innocent.</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s laugh was the only answer he would give.</p><p>When the food was ready, Dougless cleaned the kitchen\u2014Nicholas refused to help\u2014and packed everything in a big basket along with a thermos of lemonade. Nicholas carried it for her out to a little walled garden, where they sat under elm trees and ate.</p><p>She told him about reading the diary that morning, and as he ate his fifth piece of chicken, she asked him about his wife. \u201cYou never mention her. You talk about your mother and your brother who died. You\u2019ve even mentioned your favorite horse, but you never say anything about your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have me tell of her?\u201d he said in a tone that was almost warning.</p><p>\u201cIs she as beautiful as Arabella?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas thought of Lettice. She seemed farther away than a mere four hundred years. Arabella was stupid\u2014a man could never have a moment\u2019s conversation with her\u2014but she had passion. Lettice had no passion, but she had brains\u2014brains enough to always determine what was best for her. \u201cNo, she is not like Arabella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she like me?\u201d Dougless asked.</p><p>Nicholas looked at her and thought of Lettice cooking a meal. \u201cShe is not like you. What is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSliced tomatoes,\u201d she said absently, then started to ask Nicholas more questions, but he interrupted her.</p><p>\u201cThe man who abandoned you, you said you loved him. Why?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Dougless immediately felt defensive and started to say that Robert was great husband material, but before she spoke, her shoulders slumped. \u201cEgo,\u201d she said. \u201cMy own overblown sense of how powerful I was. Robert told me no one had ever loved him very much. He said his mother was cold to him and his wife had been frigid. I don\u2019t know why I thought this, but I truly believed that I could give him all the love he\u2019d ever need. So I tried. I gave to him and gave to him, and when that wasn\u2019t enough, I gave some more. I honestly tried to do everything he wanted me to do, but . . .\u201d</p><p>Halting, she looked up at the sky for a moment. \u201cI guess I thought that someday he\u2019d be like those men in the movies, and turn to me and say, \u2018You\u2019re the best woman in the world. You give me all that I ask for.\u2019 But he didn\u2019t. Robert kept saying, \u2018You never give me anything.\u2019 So, dumb me, I\u2019d try even harder to give him more. But . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Nicholas asked softly.</p><p>Dougless tried to smile. \u201cBut in the end, he gave his daughter a diamond bracelet and me half of the bills.\u201d</p><p>She looked away from him, but then she saw he was holding out a ring to her. He\u2019d stopped wearing his big rings when he astutely saw that no other men wore such rings. This ring had an emerald the size of a beach pebble.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad I access to what is mine, I would shower you with jewels.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve already given me the pin.\u201d She held her hand to her heart. She wore the pin inside her bra, afraid to wear it outside because its age and uniqueness might cause questions. \u201cYou\u2019ve given me too much already. You\u2019ve bought me clothes, you\u2019ve . . . You\u2019ve been kind to me.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNicholas, the time since I met you has been the happiest of my life. I hope you never go back.\u201d</p><p>She clamped her hand over her mouth. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that. Of course you need to go back. You need to go back to your beautiful wife. You need to . . . need to make some heirs to inherit those wonderful estates you\u2019ll not have to forfeit to the queen. But, did you realize that if Dr. Nolman tells us who betrayed you, you might return at that moment? Immediately. Lee says the name and you disappear. Pouf! Gone, just like that.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas, who had been rummaging in the basket, stopped. \u201cI will know tomorrow. Whether he wishes to tell me or no, on the morrow I will find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Dougless said, and looked at him as though trying to memorize his features. She looked down at his body, at the shirt stretched across his wide shoulders, at his flat belly and his muscular legs. Fine legs, he\u2019d said, and she remembered him wrapped in a towel.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d she whispered, leaning toward him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d he asked sharply, holding up a big square of chocolate between their faces.</p><p>\u201cA brownie,\u201d she said, feeling like a fool. Who was she kidding? He\u2019d kissed her a few times, but only when she\u2019d thrown herself at him. Yet he\u2019d returned from a morning with Arabella with his shirt misbuttoned. \u201cFood,\u201d she muttered. She seemed able to please him only with food and plastic wrap. She so much wanted to touch him that her fingertips ached, but he seemed to have no such feeling toward her.</p><p>\u201cI guess we better go,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cArabella will be back soon and she\u2019ll want you.\u201d She started to get up, but Nicholas caught her arm.</p><p>\u201cI would rather an hour with you than a life with Arabella.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing, Dougless didn\u2019t dare look at him, but she sat back down. Was he telling the truth or just trying to make her feel better?</p><p>\u201cSing me a song while I eat these,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sing and I don\u2019t know any songs. How about a story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d was all he said, his mouth full of chocolate.</p><p>Dougless realized how many stories were new to him, stories that were part of her culture but he knew nothing of. She told him of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.</p><p>\u201cI have a cousin like that,\u201d he said. He finished off the plate of brownies, then, to her surprise, turned and put his head on her lap.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to get fat if you keep eating like you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think me fat?\u201d he asked, looking up at her in a way that made Dougless\u2019s heart beat faster. He seemed to know exactly what he did to her and laughed at her for it, but he remained unaffected by her. Only when she was near another man did he show any interest in her.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes and behave,\u201d she said, then stroked his hair, that thick soft, curling mass, while she told him story after story, until he fell asleep.</p><p>It was nearly sundown when he opened his eyes again. Lying still, he looked up at her for a long while. \u201cWe must go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said softly. \u201cTonight I will try to find out from Lee who betrayed you.\u201d</p><p>He moved so that he was kneeling before her, and he put one hand on her cheek. Dougless held her breath, as she thought he was going to kiss her again. \u201cWhen I return to my time,\u201d he said, \u201cI will think of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I, you,\u201d she said, putting her hand on his.</p><p>Moving away, he picked up the emerald ring from where it was sitting on the basket lid and put it in her hand, then closed her fingers over the ring.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, I can\u2019t take this. You\u2019ve given me so much already.\u201d</p><p>When his eyes locked with hers, there was a faraway sadness in them. \u201cI would give more than this to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo . . .\u201d she encouraged.</p><p>\u201cTo take you back with me.\u201d</p><p>Dougless drew her breath in sharply.</p><p>Nicholas cursed himself. He should not have said that. He should not make her hope. He did not want to hurt her, but the thought of leaving her behind was becoming an almost unbearable pain. Soon he would find out what he needed to know; then he knew he\u2019d go back. One night more, he thought. At the most he\u2019d have one more night with her.</p><p>Perhaps tonight he\u2019d take her to his bed. Their last night spent in love and ecstasy.</p><p>No! he told himself, looking into her eyes, falling into them. He could not do that to her. He could not leave her behind weeping harder than when he\u2019d first seen her. Hell, he thought, he could not do it to himself. To go back to his cold wife, to the emptiness of women like Arabella. No, it was better to leave her untouched. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, grinning, \u201cto cook for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCook?\u201d Dougless asked stupidly. \u201cYou want me to cook for you? Why you overbearing, insufferable, vain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPillicock?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds perfect. You pillicock! If you think I\u2019m going back to a time of no running water, no doctors, where the dentists yank out your teeth and break your jaw doing it, just to cook for you, then\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He leaned forward, nuzzled his face under her hair, then licked her earlobe. \u201cI will let you visit my bed.\u201d</p><p>Pushing him away, Dougless started to describe his vanity, but, abruptly, her expression changed. She could give it out too. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll go back with you and cook for you, and Sunday afternoons we\u2019ll stay in bed together. Or on the tables. Whichever.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas rocked back on his heels, and his face seemed to drain of color. He began tossing scraps into the basket. It horrified him to think of her in his age. If she were his lover, Lettice would chop her into little pieces.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d Dougless said, \u201cI was just teasing.\u201d He didn\u2019t look at her. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll take the ring if it will make you happy.\u201d</p><p>He stopped shoving things into the basket and looked at her. \u201cYou do not know what you say. Do not wish for what should not be. When last I was home, I was to face the blade. If I went back, and you came with me, you would be alone. My age is not like yours. Lone women do not fare well. If I were not there to fend for you, you\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She put her hand on his arm. \u201cI was only teasing. I won\u2019t go back. I have no secrets to find out. You came here to find out something, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are right,\u201d he said, then lifted her hand and kissed it. He stood, and Dougless could see he planned to leave the basket where it was. He\u2019d probably cleaned up only because he was upset. But what in the world had upset him? she wondered.</p><p>She carried the basket back to the house, following behind him, neither of them speaking.</p><p>FIFTEEN</p><p>When they got back to the house, Nicholas barely nodded to her as he went through the kitchen and up to his room. Dougless, more puzzled than anything else, went to her room. On her bed was a large box, bearing the name of an express company. Dougless tore into it, throwing tape and paper everywhere.</p><p>Inside were two of her mother\u2019s beautiful designer gowns.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, thank you, Elizabeth,\u201d she breathed, holding a gown up to her body. Maybe tonight Nicholas would notice someone besides the stately Arabella, she thought, smiling broadly.</p><p>When Dougless walked into the sitting room where the Harewood family was serving cocktails, she knew the two and a half hours she\u2019d taken to dress had been worth it. Lee paused with his drink halfway to his mouth, and Lady Arabella, for once, looked away from Nicholas. Lord Harewood even stopped talking about guns and dogs and his roses. But Nicholas, Dougless thought, ah . . . his reaction made all the effort worthwhile. When he first saw her, his eyes lit up, then they grew hot as he stepped toward her. But he halted before he reached her and stood there scowling at her.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s white dress was one piece of clingy fabric that had one long sleeve, but left her other shoulder and arm bare. It was covered with tiny beads, and when she moved, they showed off every curve she had. She had fastened Gloria\u2019s diamond bracelet about her bare left wrist.</p><p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Lee said, looking her up and down. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>Dougless smiled at him rather regally. \u201cIs that a drink? Could you possibly get me a gin and tonic?\u201d</p><p>Lee went off as obediently as a schoolboy.</p><p>It was amazing what clothes could do for a woman, Dougless thought. Last night she\u2019d wanted to cower under the table in Arabella\u2019s presence, but tonight Arabella\u2019s red, low cut gown looked cheap and tasteless.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d Nicholas asked, hovering over her.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d she said, blinking innocently up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou are exposed.\u201d He sounded shocked.</p><p>\u201cA lot less than your Arabella is,\u201d she snapped, then smiled. \u201cDo you like this dress? I had my sister ship it to me.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s back was straighter than usual. \u201cDo you mean to see that physician after supper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cRemember that you told me you wanted me to find out what he knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d Arabella called. \u201cDinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must not wear that gown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear anything I please, and you better go. Arabella is rattling your table legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere you are,\u201d Lee said, handing Dougless a drink. \u201cGood evening, your lordship.\u201d</p><p>Dinner was a wonderful experience for Dougless. Nicholas couldn\u2019t keep his eyes off her\u2014much to the lovely Lady Arabella\u2019s fury. Lee hovered over her so closely that at one point his coat sleeve dangled in Dougless\u2019s soup bowl.</p><p>After dinner they went to the drawing room, and, like a scene out of a Jane Austen novel, Nicholas played the piano and sang. He had a rich, deep voice that she loved. He invited Dougless to sing with him, but she knew she had no voice. But she had to sit on a hard little chair and watch jealously as Arabella and Nicholas sang a duet, their heads together, their voices entwined.</p><p>At ten o\u2019clock, Dougless excused herself and went to her room. She had no desire to spend the evening with Lee alone in his room. The secret of who betrayed Nicholas would have to wait another day.</p><p>But at midnight, Dougless knew she wasn\u2019t going to be able to sleep. She kept seeing Nicholas singing with Arabella, kept remembering the way he\u2019d returned from the fields with his shirt misbuttoned. She got out of bed, put on her robe, fluffed up her hair, and made her way through the big house to Nicholas\u2019s room. There was no light from under his door, but there was light and the sound of glasses clinking and Arabella\u2019s seductive laugh coming from under her door.</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t think about what she was doing. She gave a brisk single knock and at the same time, she put her hand on the doorknob, turned it, and walked into Arabella\u2019s bedroom. \u201cHi. I was wondering if I could borrow a pin. I seem to have broken a strap. A very important strap, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas was stretched out on Arabella\u2019s bed, his shirt open and hanging out of his trousers. Arabella was wearing a filmy black peignoir that didn\u2019t cover much of her skin, and what little fabric there was, was transparent.</p><p>\u201cYou . . . you . . .\u201d Arabella sputtered.</p><p>\u201cOh hello, my lord. Did I interrupt something?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas was looking at her with great amusement.</p><p>\u201cLook at this,\u201d Dougless said, \u201ca Bang and Olufsen TV. I\u2019ve never seen one before. I hope you don\u2019t mind, but I really wanted to see the late news. Ah, here\u2019s the remote control.\u201d She sat on the edge of the bed, turned on the big color TV, then began flipping channels. Behind her she felt Nicholas sit up.</p><p>\u201cA movie,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNaw, just TV.\u201d She handed him the remote control. \u201cSee, here\u2019s the on and off. This is volume, and these are channels. Look at that! It\u2019s an old movie about Queen Elizabeth.\u201d She flipped off the TV, put the remote control on the bedside table near Nicholas, yawned, then stood up. \u201cI just remembered that I do have some pins after all. Thanks, though, Lady Arabella. Hope I didn\u2019t disturb you too much.\u201d</p><p>Dougless had to run to the door because Arabella was coming after her, her hands made into claws. Dougless barely made it out the door before it slammed on her heels. Standing outside, she listened to what went on inside the room. After a moment she heard the unmistakable sounds of a TV western; then Arabella screeched, \u201cTurn that off!\u201d But the next sound was Bette Davis\u2019s voice in her role as Queen Elizabeth the First. Clever man, Dougless thought, smiling; he had found the channel. Still smiling, Dougless went back to her room, and this time, she had no trouble going to sleep.</p><p>In the morning, Lee met her for breakfast. \u201cI thought you were going to come by my room last night,\u201d he said. \u201cI was going to read the letters to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlanning to tell me who betrayed Nicholas Stafford?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d was all Lee would say; so after breakfast Dougless followed him up the stairs. If he told her the name, would Nicholas immediately return to the sixteenth century?</p><p>But she saw right away that getting Lee to tell her anything was going to be a problem.</p><p>\u201cI was trying to remember. Wasn\u2019t your father on the board of directors at Yale? Maybe he\u2019d be interested in reading my findings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d sure be glad to tell him about them. I\u2019d especially like to tell him who betrayed Lord Nicholas,\u201d she said.</p><p>Lee stepped very close to her. \u201cI\u2019d tell you if perhaps you made a little call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s staying in the wilds of Maine right now and can\u2019t be reached.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he said, turning away. \u201cI guess I can\u2019t tell you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou little extortionist,\u201d Dougless seethed before she thought. \u201cYou\u2019re playing with a career, but the name of this traitor means a man\u2019s life!\u201d</p><p>He turned to her with a look of astonishment. \u201cHow can some sixteenth-century papers mean someone\u2019s life?\u201d</p><p>There was no way she could explain to him. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to my father. In fact, I\u2019ll write him a letter today. I\u2019ll even let you see the letter, and I\u2019ll make sure that he gets it the minute he returns home.\u201d</p><p>Lee looked at her, frowning. \u201cWhy do you want this name so much? There\u2019s something fishy about all this. Who is Lord Stafford anyway? You two don\u2019t act much like secretary and boss. You act more like\u2014\u201d</p><p>It was at that moment that the door flew open and Nicholas entered the dining room. He was wearing his Elizabethan clothes, his legs showing all their muscularity in the tight hose, his silver and gold armor flashing in the sunlight. He held his sword straight out and pointed it at Lee\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cJust what is this?\u201d Lee demanded. He pushed the sword away, then gasped when the sharp blade cut the side of his hand.</p><p>Nicholas advanced on him, the tip of the lethal weapon at Lee\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cDougless, go get some help,\u201d Lee said, backing up. \u201cHe\u2019s gone mad.\u201d</p><p>When Lee was pinned against the wall, Nicholas spoke. \u201cWho betrayed me to the queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetrayed you? You\u2019re crazy. Dougless, get some help before this lunatic does something we\u2019ll both regret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay his name,\u201d Nicholas said, pushing the sword tip deeper into Lee\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Lee said, exasperated. \u201cIt was a man named\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Dougless cried as she looked at Nicholas. \u201cIf he tells, you might go. Oh, Nicholas, I might never see you again.\u201d</p><p>Still holding the sword at Lee\u2019s throat, Nicholas held his arm out to Dougless, and she ran to him, her mouth to his before their bodies touched. She kissed him with all the longing, all the pent-up desire she felt. Her hands clutched his hair, pulling his head down as she kissed him. For all that Dougless thought he didn\u2019t desire her, the passion she felt coming from Nicholas made her feet come off the floor as he lifted her with one arm.</p><p>He broke away first. \u201cGo,\u201d he ordered her.</p><p>Tears were blurring Dougless\u2019s eyes, but she could swear there were tears forming in Nicholas\u2019s eyes too.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said again. \u201cStand away from me.\u201d</p><p>Obediently, too limp to disobey, Dougless walked a few feet away, then stood in silence looking at him. Never to see him again, she thought. Never to hold him, never to hear him laugh, never\u2014</p><p>\u201cThe name!\u201d Nicholas demanded, his eyes never leaving Dougless\u2019s. When he left this world, he wanted his last sight to be of her.</p><p>Lee was bewildered by all that was going on. \u201cThe man was named\u2014\u201d</p><p>Everything happened at once. Dougless, unable to bear the thought of Nicholas\u2019s leaving, made a flying leap at him. If he was going, she was going too.</p><p>\u201cRobert Sydney,\u201d Lee said as Nicholas and Dougless went sprawling on the floor at his feet. He looked down at them. \u201cBoth of you are crazy,\u201d he said, then stepped over them as he left the room.</p><p>Dougless kept her head buried against the silver-coated steel of Nicholas\u2019s armor, her eyes tightly shut.</p><p>When Nicholas recovered himself, he looked down at her, amused. \u201cWe have arrived,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhere? Are there cars outside or donkey carts?\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he lifted her face in his hands. \u201cWe remain in your time. I said you were to stand to one side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I . . . ah, I . . .\u201d She rolled off him to sit up. \u201cI just thought it might be a wonderful experience to see Elizabethan England firsthand. I could write a book, and you know, answer all the questions that people really want to know, like was Elizabeth bald or not? How did you men really treat the women? What did\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nicholas sat up and kissed her mouth most sweetly. \u201cYou cannot return with me.\u201d He put his hand to his back. \u201cYou are hard on my armor. There are scratches from when you last struck me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were about to step in front of a bus.\u201d</p><p>Standing, he held out his hands to lift her, but when Dougless stood up, she wouldn\u2019t release his hands. \u201cYou\u2019re still here.\u201d She breathed at last. \u201cYou know the traitor\u2019s name and yet you\u2019re still here. Robert Sydney. Sydney? But wasn\u2019t it Arabella Sydney that you . . . That you and she . . .\u201d</p><p>Nicholas put his arm about her shoulders and walked to the window. \u201cHe was Arabella\u2019s husband,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBut it is not easy to believe he would lie to the queen about me. I always thought of him as a good man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you and that table!\u201d Dougless said fiercely. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been so . . . so overzealous and had Arabella on the table, her husband might not have hated you. And what about your wife? She must have been pretty upset too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was unmarried on that occasion when I took Arabella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn that occasion,\u201d Dougless muttered. \u201cMaybe Sydney got mad for all the other times too.\u201d She turned to look at him. \u201cIf I went back with you, maybe I could keep you out of trouble.\u201d</p><p>He pushed her head down on his armored chest. \u201cYou cannot return with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you won\u2019t return. Maybe you\u2019re going to stay here forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe must go to Ashburton, where my tomb lies. Now that I know what I came to find, I needs must go there and pray.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to say more, wanted to say something that would make him give up the idea of returning, but she knew there were no words that could change his mind. His family, his name, and his honor were very important to him. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave today,\u201d Dougless said softly. \u201cI can\u2019t see that you need to see any more of Arabella.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you no more calculators or televisions to distract me?\u201d he asked, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI was saving the stereo for tonight.\u201d</p> <p>He turned her around to face him, his hands on her shoulders. \u201cI will pray alone,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I return, I go alone. You understand me?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. Borrowed time, she thought. We are now on borrowed time.</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>Dougless sat on the twin bed in the bed-and-breakfast and looked across at Nicholas in the other bed. The early morning light made his face above the light cover dim and indistinct, but it was enough for her to see him. They\u2019d known the name of the traitor for three days now, and every minute of those three days Dougless was sure he was going to disappear. Every morning he went to the church and spent two hours on his knees praying before his tomb. He spent another two hours in the afternoon praying.</p><p>And each time he went inside the church, Dougless stayed outside and held her breath. She was sure that each time he stepped inside it would be the last time she ever saw him again. At ten A.M. and four P.M. she would tiptoe into the church, and when she saw that he was still there, sharp tears of relief and joy came to her eyes. She would run to him, and her heart went out to him when she saw the sweat on his face and body. He prayed so hard each day that afterward he was limp with exhaustion. Dougless would help him stand, as his knees would be painful and stiff from two hours of kneeling on the cold stone floor. The vicar, feeling pity for Nicholas, had put out a cushion for him, but Nicholas refused to use it, saying he needed the pain of his body to make him remember what must be done.</p> <p>Dougless didn\u2019t ask why he needed a reminder of his duty because she didn\u2019t want to jinx the growing seed of hope that she was beginning to cherish. Every day when she went to him in the church and she saw that he was still with her, there seemed to be a light in his eyes. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t return, Dougless was beginning to think. She knew she, too, should pray for his return. She knew that honor and a family name and the future of many people were more important than her selfish wants, but every time she saw him still kneeling in the church, sunlight on his big body, she whispered, \u201cThank You, God.\u201d</p><p>Three days, she thought, three heavenly days. When Nicholas wasn\u2019t in church, they spent every moment together. She rented bicycles, then had a hilarious time teaching him to ride. Whenever Nicholas fell, he pulled her with him, so that they went tumbling together across the sweet English grasses. Across sweet English grasses filled with cow manure.</p><p>Laughing at how awful they smelled, they ran back to the B and B to shower and shampoo. Dougless had rented a VCR machine and a tape, so they spent the rest of the afternoon in their room watching a movie.</p><p>As Nicholas was insatiable for knowledge, they purchased a lending card from the little local library and went through hundreds of books. Nicholas wanted to see everything that had happened since 1564, and he wanted to hear every piece of music. He wanted to smell, taste, touch everything.</p><p>\u201cWere I to remain here,\u201d he said one afternoon, \u201cI would make houses.\u201d</p><p>It took Dougless a moment to realize that he meant he would like to design them. The beauty of Thornwyck Castle showed he had talent. Before she could stop herself, a flood of words came from her mouth. \u201cYou could go to architecture school. You\u2019d have to learn a lot about modern building materials, but I could help you. I could teach you how to read modern print better and my uncle J.T. could get you a passport. He\u2019s the king of Lanconia, so we\u2019d just say you\u2019re a Lanconian; that way, I could take you back to the U.S. My father could help you get into a school to study architecture, and in the summer we could go to my hometown of Warbrooke on the coast of Maine\u2014it\u2019s beautiful there\u2014and we could go sailing and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He turned away. \u201cI must return.\u201d</p><p>Yes, return, she thought. To go back to his wife, the woman he loved so much. How could Dougless care so much for him and he feel nothing for her? The other men in her life had wanted something from her. Robert had wanted her submission; do it my way or don\u2019t do it, was his philosophy. A couple of men had dated her because of her family\u2019s money. A couple of men had wanted her because she was so gullible, so easy to fool. But Nicholas was different. He wasn\u2019t trying to take anything from her.</p><p>There were times when Dougless looked at him and such lust filled her that she wanted to leap on him in the library, or in the pub, or on the street. She kept having fantasies about tearing his clothes off and ravishing him.</p><p>But every time she got too close, he stepped away. It seemed that he was interested in tasting, smelling, touching everything in the world except her.</p><p>She tried to interest him. Heavens! but she tried. She paid\u2014on her credit card\u2014two hundred pounds for a red silk peignoir set that was guaranteed to drive a man wild. When she came out of the bathroom wearing it, Nicholas had barely glanced at her. She\u2019d bought a tiny bottle of perfume called Tigress that set her back seventy-five pounds; then she\u2019d leaned over Nicholas so that her shirt fell away from her br**sts and asked if he liked the smell. He\u2019d barely mumbled a reply.</p><p>She put her jeans in scalding hot water in the bathtub to shrink them, and when they were dry, they were so tight she had to put a big safety pin on the zipper and lie on the floor to pull it up. She wore them with a thin silk blouse and no bra. Nicholas didn\u2019t look.</p><p>She would have thought he was g*y if he hadn\u2019t looked at every other female who passed them.</p><p>Dougless bought black hose, black high heels, and a teeny, tiny black skirt and wore it with the red silk blouse. She felt ridiculous riding a bicycle wearing high heels, but she did it anyway. She rode in front of Nicholas for four miles, but he never once looked. Two cars ran into ditches looking at her, but Nicholas paid no attention whatever.</p> <p>The videotape she rented was Body Heat.</p><p>By the fourth day she was desperate, and with their landlady\u2019s help, she devised an elaborate scheme to get Nicholas in bed with her. The landlady told Nicholas she needed their room, so Dougless made reservations at a nearby lovely country house hotel. She told Nicholas the only room she could get had one large four-poster bed, but that they\u2019d have to make do. He\u2019d given her an odd look that she couldn\u2019t fathom, then walked away.</p><p>So now Dougless was in the bathroom of the hotel, where she\u2019d been for thirty minutes. She felt as nervous as a virgin bride on her wedding night. With trembling hands, she doused herself in perfume and loosened the ties down the front of her peignoir.</p><p>Ready at last, she fluffed her hair and left the bathroom. The room was dark, but she could see the outline of the bed\u2014the bed she was to share with Nicholas.</p><p>Slowly, she walked toward the bed. She could see the long shape of his body under the covers, and she reached out her hand to touch him. \u201cNicholas,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>But her hand didn\u2019t touch him. Instead, she touched . . . Pillows!</p><p>When she turned on the bedside lamp, she saw that Nicholas had made a barricade of all the pillows down the middle of the bed. They reached from the head to the foot of the bed. On the far side Nicholas lay with his back to her, and his broad back was like another barricade.</p><p>Biting her lip to keep tears from coming, she climbed into bed, staying on the edge, not touching the hated pillows. She didn\u2019t turn out the light because suddenly all strength left her body. Tears, hot, hot tears began rolling down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDougless,\u201d Nicholas said softly, turning toward her, but not reaching over the pillows to touch her.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I so undesirable to you?\u201d she asked, and hated herself for doing so, but she had no pride left. \u201cI see you look at other women who I know aren\u2019t built as well as I am. And I know they aren\u2019t . . . aren\u2019t as pretty as I am, but you never look at me. Sometimes you kiss me but nothing more. You had your hands all over Arabella and you\u2019ve made love to so many women, but you refuse me. Why? Am I too short? Too fat? You hate redheads?\u201d</p><p>When Nicholas spoke, she could tell that the words were from deep inside him. \u201cI have never desired a woman as much as I have you,\u201d he said. \u201cMy body aches with the wanting of you, but I must leave. I cannot return and know I leave you grieving. When I first saw you, you were weeping so that I heard you across four hundred years. I cannot leave you to such grief again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t touch me because you don\u2019t want me to grieve for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Dougless\u2019s tears began to be replaced by laughter. She got out of bed and, standing, she looked down at him. \u201cYou idiot,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t you realize that when you leave, I\u2019m going to grieve for you every day for the rest of my life? I\u2019m going to cry so long and loud and hard that I will be heard to the beginning of time. Oh, Nicholas, you fool, don\u2019t you know how much I love you? Whether you touch me or not, you won\u2019t be able to stop my tears.\u201d</p><p>Pausing, she smiled at him in a cocky way. \u201cWhile I\u2019m grieving, why don\u2019t you let me have a memory that will knock Arabella off her table?\u201d</p><p>As Dougless stood and watched, Nicholas just lay there, not moving, just looking at her across the pillows. One second he was in bed, the next he was on her and they were on the floor. Dougless never saw him move, she just felt his body against hers, felt his mouth on her skin, his hands holding her shoulders, then moving quickly and firmly out to her hands.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d she whispered, \u201cNicholas.\u201d</p><p>He was on her, his mouth and hands everywhere, as she kissed whatever part of him came near her mouth. His hands tore at her gown and Dougless heard it ripping away. When his hot, wet mouth fastened onto her breast, she moaned in ecstasy.</p><p>This was Nicholas, the man she\u2019d wanted, desired, and craved for hundreds of hours. His big, hard hands moved down the side of her, his thumb toying with her navel as his lips and tongue played with her br**sts.</p><p>Her fingers buried into his hair. \u201cLet me,\u201d she whispered. She had always chosen men who needed her, men who thought no one could give them enough. Dougless\u2019s experience with sex had been with men who expected her to give to them.</p><p>\u201cNicholas?\u201d she said as his lips began moving down her belly. \u201cNicholas, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d His hands caressed her thighs, his thumb kneading the soft white flesh there; then he moved downward, downward.</p><p>Dougless arched her body against the carpet. No man had ever done this to her before. Passion built in her as his tongue . . . Oh, God, his tongue.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d she moaned, and began to pull his hair as her body moved under him. He nibbled at the inside of her thighs, caressing the back of her knees, until she didn\u2019t think she could stand it any more.</p><p>Taking her left leg in his hand, he bent it up as he moved on top of her and entered her so hard and big she tried to push him away. But her body closed around him, her free leg wrapping about his leg, as he pounded into her with hard, deep thrusts that pushed her across the carpet. She put up her hands to brace herself against the wall.</p><p>When Nicholas released her bent leg, she clasped him about the waist, and her h*ps rose to meet his thrusts as his hands cupped her bu**ocks and lifted her to him. Higher, higher.</p><p>When at last she felt him arch into her for a final blinding thrust, Dougless felt her own body shuddering in answer.</p><p>It was a while before she came to herself to remember where she was, or even who she was. Her head was almost against the wall; the bedside table and lamp loomed over her.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d she murmured, touching his sweaty hair. \u201cNo wonder Arabella risked all for you.\u201d</p><p>Lifting himself on one elbow, he looked down at her. \u201cDo you sleep?\u201d he asked, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, that was wonderful,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNo man\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t allow her to finish, but took her hand and lifted her to stand by him. Gently, sweetly, deeply, he kissed her, then took her hand and led her into the bathroom. He got the shower water hot, then pulled her in with him. Pinning her to the wall, he kissed her, his big, hard body pressing against hers.</p><p>\u201cI have dreamed of this,\u201d he murmured. \u201cThis water fountain was made for love.\u201d</p><p>Dougless was too absorbed in the way he was moving down to her br**sts to be able to answer him. With the hot water beating on them, Nicholas began kissing her body, his mouth on her br**sts, on her stomach and her neck. Dougless had her head back, her hands on his shoulders, shoulders so broad they nearly reached from one side to the other of the shower stall.</p><p>He came up to face her. When Dougless opened her eyes, she saw he was smiling at her. \u201cPerhaps some things in this modern world do not change,\u201d he said. \u201cI seem to be your teacher now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d she said as she began kissing his neck, then across his shoulder and down his muscular chest, her hands kneading his back muscles. Fat, she thought. She\u2019d said he was going to get fat, but all of him was muscle, thick, hard, sculptured muscle.</p><p>The hot water beat down on her head, and she went lower, her hands on his bu**ocks. When her mouth closed over him, it was his turn to gasp. His hands buried themselves in her wet hair as she heard his soft moans of pleasure.</p><p>He nearly pulled her up by her hair as he slammed her against the slick wall, pulled her legs about his waist, and rammed into her almost brutally. Dougless held on to his passion, fastening herself to him as his mouth took hers, his tongue thrusting just as his body did.</p><p>When the final moment came, Dougless would have screamed except that Nicholas covered her mouth with his.</p><p>She clung to him, trembling, her body limp. She was sure that if Nicholas hadn\u2019t been holding her, she would have gone down the drain.</p><p>He kissed her neck. \u201cNow I will wash you,\u201d he said softly as he set her on her own feet, then caught her when she nearly fell.</p><p>As though he had an electric switch in his body, he seemed to turn his passion off as he turned her to face the showerhead and began to shampoo her hair. His big, strong hands and his big body made her feel small and fragile\u2014and protected. When he was done with her hair, he lathered his hands and began soaping her body.</p><p>Dougless leaned back against the wall as Nicholas\u2019s hands slid over her, up and down, around, in and out. Before she forgot herself, she took the soap and began to caress him with her soapy hands. He had the most beautiful body she\u2019d ever seen on a human. Heavens! she thought, even his feet were beautiful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She turned off the water and soaped him. She loved looking at him, touching him. There was a birthmark on his left hip, shaped like a figure eight. There was a scar on his right calf. \u201cFell off a horse,\u201d he murmured, eyes closed. There was a long scar on his left forearm. \u201cSword practice the day . . .\u201d Dougless knew that the rest of the sentence was, \u201cthe day Kit died.\u201d There was an odd oval scar on his shoulder. Nicholas smiled, his eyes closed. \u201cA fight with Kit. I won,\u201d he said.</p><p>She came back to his head. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see no woman has left a mark on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly you, Montgomery, have marked me,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Dougless wanted to ask him about his wife. Did he care for her, Dougless, as much as he loved his beautiful wife? But she didn\u2019t ask, as she was too afraid of the answer she\u2019d hear.</p> <p>Nicholas turned her around, turned the water back on, then rinsed them both. When they were clean, he pulled her out of the shower and began gently combing her hair. Dougless wanted to put on her robe, but Nicholas wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p><p>\u201cI have dreamed of you this way,\u201d he said, looking at her in the mirror. \u201cYou have fair driven me mad. The smell of you.\u201d He stopped combing and slid his hands down her arms. \u201cThe clothes you wear . . .\u201d</p><p>Dougless smiled, her head back against his. He had noticed, she thought. He had.</p><p>When her hair was combed, he toweled it dry, then held up the white terry robe the hotel furnished. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, putting on the other robe.</p><p>He led her downstairs, through the darkened hotel lobby, and into the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d she said, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her to silence. \u201cI am hungry,\u201d he said as though that were excuse enough.</p><p>Being in the hotel kitchen when she knew they shouldn\u2019t be added excitement to this most wonderful night. She looked at the back of Nicholas as he opened a refrigerator door (and felt a little pang that he had learned of refrigerators from someone other than her). Now he was truly hers, she thought, hers to touch whenever she wanted. Holding his hand, she pressed her body against his and put her head in the crook of his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI love you so much. Don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>Turning, he looked into her eyes, and his face was full of longing. He looked back in the refrigerator. \u201cWhere\u2019s the ice cream?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIn the freezer. Try that door,\u201d she said, pointing.</p> <p>He wouldn\u2019t let her out of his sight or touch as he pulled her toward the freezer. There were big cardboard vats of ice cream inside. Clinging together like Siamese twins, they went about the kitchen and found bowls, spoons, and a steel ladle. Nicholas scooped out an enormous amount from one vat into each bowl, then slipped the vat back into the freezer. He dribbled vanilla ice cream down the front of her, then licked it off, the ice cream traveling lower, just below his tongue. He licked the last just as it reached her red-gold curls.</p><p>\u201cStrawberry,\u201d he said, making Dougless laugh.</p><p>They sat facing each other, legs crossed, on the eight-foot-long butcher-block cutting table (\u201cUnsanitary,\u201d Dougless said), but she didn\u2019t get down. They ate quietly for a moment, but then Nicholas dropped ice cream on Dougless\u2019s foot and licked it off. Dougless leaned forward to kiss Nicholas and \u201caccidently\u201d dropped ice cream on his inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet that\u2019s awfully cold,\u201d she said against his lips.</p><p>\u201cI cannot bear it,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She slowly, so that her br**sts raked along his bare body, made her way to the splat of ice cream on his thigh, licked it off, and when it was gone, she continued licking. The ice cream was forgotten as Nicholas leaned back against the table and pulled her up to him. As though she weighed nothing, his biceps bulging, he picked her up and set her down on top of him, his hands moving up her body to clutch her br**sts as Dougless moved slowly up and down.</p><p>It was a long time before they arched together, Nicholas pulling her down to him to kiss her hungrily and fiercely.</p><p>\u201cI believe, madam,\u201d he whispered in her ear, \u201cthat you have melted my ice cream.\u201d</p> <p>Laughing, Dougless snuggled against him. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to touch you for so long,\u201d she said, her hand caressing his chest and shoulders inside the sleeve of the robe that he still wore. \u201cI\u2019ve never met a man like you.\u201d</p><p>She lifted on one elbow and looked down at him. \u201cWere you an unusual man in the sixteenth century, or were they all like you?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas grinned at her. \u201cI am unique, which is why the women\u2014\u201d</p><p>She kissed him to silence. \u201cSay no more. I\u2019d as soon hear nothing more about your women\u2014or your wife.\u201d She put her head down. \u201cI\u2019d like to think I\u2019m special to you, not just one of hundreds.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her chin to look at her. \u201cYou called me across centuries, and I answered. Is that not enough to make you \u2018special\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you do care for me? At least somewhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no words,\u201d he said, then kissed her lightly and pushed her head back down, but as he stroked her damp hair, he felt her relax against him and knew she was falling asleep. Closing her robe, he bundled her into his arms and carried her out of the kitchen and up to their room. Once they were inside their room, he removed both their robes, put her into bed, then climbed in beside her. She was already asleep as he snuggled her to him.</p><p>But Nicholas wasn\u2019t sleepy at all. He tried to pull her closer to him, her bare bottom up against his half-swollen maleness, his leg over hers, but she was as close as could be.</p><p>She asked if he cared for her, he thought. Cared for her? She was becoming all to him, his reason for living. He cared what she thought, what she felt, what she needed. He couldn\u2019t bear more than minutes away from her.</p><p>Each morning and afternoon he went to pray for God to return him to his own time, but part of his mind thought constantly of what it would be like to never see her again, to never hear her laugh, to never see her cry again, to never hold her in his arms.</p><p>He ran his hand over her shoulder and tucked the cover closer about her. Never had he met a woman like her. She had no guile, no sense of taking what she wanted, no sense of self-preservation. Smiling, he remembered her protests when he\u2019d first met her. She\u2019d said she would not help him, but he\u2019d seen in her eyes how she couldn\u2019t bear leaving him alone in a strange land. He thought of the women of his own time and knew of no woman who would help some poor madman.</p><p>But Dougless had, he thought. She\u2019d helped him and taught him and . . . loved him. She\u2019d given her love freely and completely.</p><p>Completely, he thought, smiling in memory of this night. No woman had ever responded to him with such complete abandonment as Dougless had tonight. Arabella used to demand. \u201cHere! Now!\u201d she\u2019d say. Other women thought they were granting him a favor. Lettice . . . He didn\u2019t like to think of his cold wife. She lay in bed stiff-limbed, her eyes open, as though challenging him to do his husbandly duties. In four years of marriage he\u2019d not been able to get her with child.</p><p>As he caressed Dougless\u2019s bare arm, in her sleep she tried to move closer to him. He kissed her temple. How could he leave her? he asked himself. How could he go back to his other life, to his other women, and leave her alone and unprotected? She was so soft that it was no wonder she was at the mercy of men like the one he\u2019d pushed out the door.</p><p>Nicholas thought of his mother and his wife. Those two women would be able to take care of themselves no matter what befell them. But not Dougless. He feared that a week after he left, she\u2019d be back with that odious man whom she believed she loved.</p><p>He stroked her hair. How could he leave her alone with no one to protect her? He did not understand the modern world. It was her father\u2019s duty to choose a husband for her, yet the man left his daughter to her own devices. Smiling, Nicholas thought of how Dougless would fare with a man of his time who a father might choose for her. All her childish talk of love would mean nothing against the joining of estates.</p><p>But as Nicholas looked down at Dougless, he knew he was beginning to understand what she meant. Love. Dougless had said that perhaps he\u2019d been sent to the modern world not for honor but for love. At the time, Nicholas had scoffed at the idea. This cataclysmic thing had happened for love and not for honor? Not possible! But they\u2019d found the name of the traitor and Nicholas had not left her world.</p><p>He remembered Dougless saying that everything in the past had turned out all right. All right to her, perhaps. He was remembered as a fool, but then, perhaps he had been a fool. There had been many other women besides Arabella, all of whom he needed when he had a wife like Lettice. It was true that perhaps cuckolding Robert Sydney had been foolish enough to cause his own death, but if he could return, he would right the wrongs.</p><p>If he returned . . .</p><p>What then? He\u2019d still be married to Lettice, and there would be women like Arabella to tempt him. Even if he could free himself from the accusation of treason, would his life change?</p><p>He turned on his back, holding Dougless tightly to him. What if he remained in this century? What if he had misjudged God\u2019s purpose? What if he had been sent forward in time, not to return and change what had happened then, but to do something in this time?</p><p>He remembered the books he and Dougless had looked at. There were books of houses from around the world, and they had intrigued him. Dougless had talked about something called architecture school where he could learn to design houses. To learn to be a tradesman? he thought in wonder. But, truthfully, \u201chaving a profession,\u201d as she called it, did not seem to be something bad in this century. Instead, men like Harewood who were mere landowners were looked down on\u2014by Americans anyway, Dougless had explained.</p><p>America, he thought, this place that Dougless talked about constantly. She said they could go to America and \u201cset up housekeeping\u201d and he could go to school. School at his age? he\u2019d asked disdainfully, not letting her see how the idea intrigued him. To live with Dougless in this modern world and design buildings? Was this the reason he had been brought forward? Perhaps God saw Thornwyck, liked it, and so had decided to give him another chance, Nicholas thought with a smile, laughing at the idea of God being so frivolous.</p><p>But what did he know of God\u2019s purpose? Obviously, he hadn\u2019t been sent forward in time to find out who betrayed him. He\u2019d found that out days ago, yet he was still here. So why had he been sent to the modern world?</p><p>\u201cNicholas!\u201d Dougless cried out, sitting up with a jolt.</p><p>As he pulled her back into his arms, she clung to him. \u201cI dreamed you were gone, that you weren\u2019t here, that you\u2019d left me,\u201d she said, blinking back tears and holding him so tightly his ribs were close to cracking.</p><p>He stroked her hair. \u201cI will not leave you,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI will remain with you for always.\u201d</p><p>It took a moment for his words to reach Dougless. She lifted up to look at him. \u201cNicholas,\u201d she said slowly, questioning.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d He took a breath. The words were hard for him. \u201cI do not wish to return. I will remain here.\u201d He looked at her. \u201cWith you.\u201d</p><p>Dougless buried her face in his shoulder and began to weep softly.</p><p>As he stroked he\u00b0]U\u00c8eUhe couldn\u2019t keep from laughing. \u201cAre you sad that I do not leave you so that you may return to this Robert who gives diamonds to children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just so happy.\u201d</p><p>He took a tissue from a box beside the bed. \u201cHere, stop your weeping and tell me more of America.\u201d He gave her a sideways look. \u201cAnd tell me of your uncle who is king.\u201d</p><p>Dougless blew her nose, then smiled at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t think you heard that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is a cowboy? What is a passport? What is the Grand Canon? And do not move so far from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s canyon,\u201d she said, moving back into his arms as she began to tell him of America, of her family, and of her uncle who\u2019d married a princess and was now king of Lanconia.</p><p>As the dawn light came into the room, they began to make plans. Dougless would call her uncle J.T. and explain as best she could that she needed a passport for Nicholas so he could go to America with her. \u201cKnowing Uncle J.T., he\u2019ll want you to go to Lanconia so he can inspect you first. But he\u2019ll like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAunt Aria? Well, she can be a little intimidating at times, but she used to play baseball with us kids. They have six kids of their own.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAnd she has this weird friend named Dolly who runs around the castle wearing blue jeans and a crown.\u201d She looked at Nicholas, at his black hair and blue eyes, and thought of the way he walked, the way he sometimes had of looking at people that made them shrivel. \u201cYou\u2019ll fit in in Lanconia,\u201d she said.</p><p>They had breakfast served in their room, and over the table, Nicholas said, \u201cI\u2019d rather have strawberry ice cream.\u201d</p><p>In another moment they were on the floor, rolling about exuberantly as they tore at each other while they made love. Afterward they filled the tub and sat at opposite ends as they planned more of their future life together.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go to Scotland,\u201d Dougless said. \u201cWhile we\u2019re waiting for the passport, we\u2019ll stay in Scotland. It\u2019s a beautiful country.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas had his foot on her stomach, kneading her flesh. \u201cWill you wear the heeled shoes to ride a bicycle?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Dougless laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me. Those shoes got me what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I too,\u201d he said, looking at her from beneath his lashes.</p><p>After the bath they dressed, and Dougless said she\u2019d call her uncle J.T. right away.</p><p>Nicholas turned away. \u201cI must return to the church for one last time,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Dougless felt her entire body stiffen. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, then ran to face him, her hands gripping his arms.</p><p>\u201cI must,\u201d he said, smiling down at her. \u201cI have been often and naught has happened. Dougless, look at me.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her head, and he smiled. \u201cAre you onion-eyed yet again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just frightened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must pray for forgiveness for not wanting to return to save my name and my honor. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded mutely. \u201cBut I\u2019m going with you and I don\u2019t let go of you. Got that? I don\u2019t wait outside for you this time.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. \u201cI mean to never again release you. Now we will go to the church for my prayers, then you will call your uncle. Does Scotland have trains?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, then it has changed. In my time it was a wild place.\u201d Putting his arm about her shoulders, he left the hotel with her.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>At the church, Dougless wouldn\u2019t release Nicholas. He knelt to pray, and she knelt beside him, both her arms tightly locked around his shoulders. When he didn\u2019t push her away as she feared he might, she knew that, in spite of his pretended amusement, he was as frightened as she was.</p> <p>They knelt together on the cold floor for over an hour. Dougless\u2019s knees hurt from the stones, and her arms ached from holding on to Nicholas, but she never considered relaxing her grip. Twice, the vicar came in and stood for a while watching them, then silently walked away.</p><p>As hard as Nicholas prayed for forgiveness, Dougless prayed twice as hard for God not to take him away but to let him stay with her forever.</p><p>At long last, Nicholas opened his eyes and turned to her. \u201cI remain,\u201d he said, smiling. Laughing, he stood up, and Dougless, almost crippled, also tried to stand, her arms still tight around him.</p><p>\u201cMy arms have no blood in them,\u201d he said, chiding her gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you go until we\u2019re out of this place.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cIt is finished. Can you not see that? I am still here. I have not turned into marble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas, stop teasing me and let\u2019s get out of here. I never want to see your tomb again.\u201d</p><p>Still smiling at her, he started to take a step, but his body didn\u2019t move. Puzzled, he looked down at his feet. From his knees down, there was nothing, merely space. There was floor where his feet should have been.</p><p>Quickly, he pulled Dougless into his arms and held her as though to crush her. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWith all my soul I love you. Across time I will love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d she said, her voice betraying her fear at his words. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>He held her face in his hands. \u201cOnly you have I loved, my Dougless. No other woman. Only you.\u201d</p> <p>She felt it then. She felt that his body was no longer solid in her arms. \u201cNicholas,\u201d she yelled in fear.</p><p>He kissed her again, kissed her softly, but with all the yearning and wanting and desire and need he felt for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d she said. \u201cTake me with you. God!\u201d she screamed. \u201cLet me go with him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDougless,\u201d Nicholas said, and his voice was far away, \u201cDougless, my love.\u201d</p><p>He was no longer in her arms but standing before his tomb wearing his armor. He was faded, indistinct, like a movie seen in a bright room. \u201cCome to me,\u201d he said, holding out his hand. \u201cCome to me.\u201d</p><p>Dougless ran to him, but she couldn\u2019t reach him.</p><p>A streak of sunlight came through the windows and flashed off his armor.</p><p>And then there was nothing.</p> <p>For one hideous moment, Dougless stood and stared at the tomb; then she put her hands to her ears and screamed, a scream such as no human had ever uttered before. The old stone walls vibrated with the sound, the windows quivered, and the tomb . . . The tomb just lay there, silent and cold.</p><p>Dougless collapsed to the floor.</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>Drink this,\u201d someone was saying.</p><p>Dougless caught the hand that held the cup to her lips. \u201cNicholas,\u201d she said, a faint smile on her lips. Her eyes flew open and she sat up. She was stretched out on a pew in the church, just a few feet from the tomb. She swung her legs to the side, placing her feet on the floor, but she felt too dizzy to take a step.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d</p><p>She turned to see the vicar, his kindly face full of concern, a cup of water in his hand.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Nicholas?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone else. Should I call someone for you? I heard you . . . scream,\u201d he said, knowing it wasn\u2019t a scream. Just remembering that sound made the hair on his body stand on end. \u201cWhen I got here, you were lying on the floor. Could I call someone for you?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>On weak legs, Dougless made her way to the tomb. Slowly, memory was coming back to her, yet still she couldn\u2019t believe it. She looked at the vicar. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see him leave, did you?\u201d she asked hoarsely. Her throat was raw.</p><p>\u201cI saw no one leave. I just saw you praying. Not many people pray with such . . . intensity today.\u201d</p><p>She looked back at the tomb. She wanted to touch it, but she knew the marble would be cold, so unlike Nicholas. \u201cYou mean you saw us praying,\u201d she corrected.</p><p>\u201cJust you,\u201d the vicar said.</p><p>Slowly, Dougless turned to look at him. \u201cNicholas and I were praying together. You came in and saw us. You\u2019ve watched him for days.\u201d</p><p>The vicar gave her a sad look. \u201cI\u2019ll take you to a doctor.\u201d</p><p>She moved away from his outstretched hand. \u201cNicholas. The man who prayed here every morning and every afternoon for the last four days. He was the man in the Elizabethan armor. Remember? He nearly walked in front of a bus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than a week ago I saw you nearly step in front of a coach. Later, you asked me the date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . ?\u201d Dougless asked. \u201cBut that was Nicholas. You told me this week you were amazed at how devout he was. I waited for him outside while he prayed. Remember?\u201d Her voice was urgent as she stepped toward him. \u201cRemember? Nicholas! You waved to us as we rode by on bicycles.\u201d</p><p>The vicar backed away from her. \u201cI saw you on a bicycle but no man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . .\u201d Dougless whispered, then stepped back from him, her eyes wide with horror.</p><p>Turning, she ran out of the church, through the churchyard, down three streets, to the left, then the right, and into the hotel. Ignoring the greeting of the woman at the desk, she ran up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d she cried as she looked about the empty room. The bathroom door was closed, and she ran to it, flung it open. Empty. She turned back to the room, but stopped in the doorway, then looked back into the bathroom. She stared at the shelf below the mirror. Her toiletries were there, but his were gone. She touched the empty half of the shelf. No razor, no shaving cream, no aftershave lotion. In the shower, his shampoo was gone.</p><p>In their room, she flung open the closet door. Nicholas\u2019s clothes were gone. Only hers hung there, her suitcases and her carry-on below on the floor. In the dresser his socks and handkerchiefs were missing.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, then sat down on the side of the bed. It almost made sense that Nicholas was gone, but not his clothes, not the things he had given her. For a moment she put her hand to her heart, then snatched open her blouse. The pin, the beautiful gold pin with the pearl hanging from it, was gone.</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t try to think after that. She tore the room apart looking for something, anything, of his that had been left behind. The emerald ring he\u2019d given her was gone; the note he\u2019d left under her door was gone. She opened her notebooks. Nicholas had written in them in his bizarre handwriting, but now the pages were blank.</p><p>\u201cThink, Dougless, think,\u201d she said. There had to be some mark left by him. In the closet were the books they\u2019d purchased; Nicholas had written his name inside them. They were blank now.</p><p>There was nothing, nothing of him. She even looked on her clothes for any dark hairs. Clean.</p><p>It was when she saw her red silk nightgown that Nicholas had torn from her body and saw that it was now whole that she became angry. \u201cNo!\u201d she said, teeth clenched. \u201cYou can\u2019t take him away from me so completely. You cannot!\u201d</p><p>People, she thought. Even if there was no physical evidence of him there were an awful lot of people who would remember him. Just because a daffy old vicar couldn\u2019t remember him didn\u2019t mean other people didn\u2019t.</p><p>Grabbing her handbag, she left the hotel.</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>Dougless opened the door to the hotel room slowly, dreading the empty room. Her body was exhausted, but unfortunately, her mind was still working.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the bed, then wearily turned and lay down. It was late and her body was empty of food, but she didn\u2019t consider eating. Her eyes were wide open, sandy-feeling, dry, as she stared up at the underside of the bed canopy.</p><p>No one remembered Nicholas.</p><p>The coin merchant had no medieval coins, and he didn\u2019t remember seeing Nicholas. Vaguely, he remembered that Dougless had come into his shop to browse. He didn\u2019t remember examining Nicholas\u2019s clothes, and he said he\u2019d never seen silver and gold armor outside a museum. The clerk in the clothing store didn\u2019t remember Nicholas pulling a sword on him. The librarian said Dougless had checked out books, but she\u2019d always been alone. The dentist said he\u2019d never seen a man with ridges on his teeth and a cracked jaw. He had no X-rays for a Nicholas Stafford. No one at the pubs remembered him or at the tea shops. They all remembered Dougless coming in alone. The bicycle shop showed her the receipt, which indicated she\u2019d rented only one bike. Their sweet landlady at the bed-and-breakfast didn\u2019t remember Nicholas, and she said no one had played her piano since her husband had died.</p><p>Like a woman possessed, Dougless went wherever she and Nicholas had been and asked anyone who might have seen him. She asked tourists in tea shops, residents on the street, clerks in stores.</p><p>Nothing, nothing, nothing.</p><p>Weary, numb with the dawning realization of what had happened, she went back to the hotel and now lay on the bed. She didn\u2019t dare go to sleep. Last night she\u2019d awakened from a dream that Nicholas was lost to her. Nicholas had cradled her in his arms, gently laughed at her, and told her she was dreaming, that he was with her and always would be.</p><p>Last night, last night, she thought. He had touched her and loved her, and today he was gone. More than gone. His body, his clothes, even other people\u2019s memory of him was gone.</p><p>And it was her fault. He had stayed as long as they hadn\u2019t made love, but once he\u2019d touched her, he\u2019d been taken away. It didn\u2019t help to know she\u2019d been right. He\u2019d come to her for love, not for righting a wrong. He\u2019d stayed when he\u2019d found out who had betrayed him, but he\u2019d slipped away through her arms once he\u2019d admitted he loved her.</p><p>She clasped her arms about her chest. He was gone as irreversibly as death. Only she had no comfort of other people who remembered and loved him.</p><p>When the telephone on the bedside table rang, she didn\u2019t at first hear it. On the fifth ring, dully, she picked it up. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDougless,\u201d said Robert\u2019s voice, stern and angry. \u201cAre you over your hysterics yet?\u201d</p><p>She felt too numb, too empty to fight. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bracelet, of course. If you aren\u2019t too wrapped up in Lover-boy to find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dougless said, slowly at first, then, \u201cWhat! Did you see him? Did you see Nicholas? Of course you did. He pushed you out the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDougless, are you out of your mind? No one has ever pushed me through any door, and they better not try it either.\u201d He sighed. \u201cNow you\u2019ve got me acting crazy. I want that bracelet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course,\u201d she said hurriedly, \u201cbut what did you mean when you referred to \u2018Lover-boy\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to repeat every\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobert,\u201d Dougless said calmly, \u201cyou either tell me, or I flush the bracelet down the toilet, and I don\u2019t believe you have insurance on it yet.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause on the other end. \u201cI was right to ditch you. You\u2019re crazy. No wonder your family won\u2019t let you have the dough until you\u2019re thirty-five. I can\u2019t put up with you that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way to the bathroom now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right! But it\u2019s hard to remember what you said that night. You were hysterical. You said something about having a job helping some guy rewrite history. That\u2019s all I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRewrite history,\u201d Dougless said under her breath. Yes, that\u2019s what Nicholas had wanted to do in this century: change history.</p><p>\u201cDougless! Dougless!\u201d Robert was shouting, but she had put down the telephone.</p><p>When Nicholas had come to her, he had been facing an execution. But what they had found out had saved him from that. Grabbing her big carry-on satchel from the closet, she stuffed some clothing and toiletries into it. As she closed a drawer, she glanced into the mirror and put her hand to her throat. Beheading. Today, she thought, we read about it, read that some person walked up a platform and another person struck them with an ax. But we don\u2019t think of what it really means.</p><p>\u201cWe saved you from that,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Once she was packed, she sat down on a chair to wait for morning. Tomorrow she\u2019d go to Nicholas\u2019s houses and hear how they had changed history. Perhaps hearing that Nicholas had lived to be an old man and had accomplished great things would help her feel better. She leaned back on the chair and stared at the bed. She didn\u2019t dare close her eyes for fear she\u2019d dream.</p><p>Dougless was on the first train out of Ashburton and arrived at Bellwood before they opened the gates. She sat outside on the grass and waited for them to open\u2014and tried not to think.</p><p>When the gates opened, she bought a ticket for the first tour. Some of her misery was beginning to leave her as she thought of how much Nicholas\u2019s name had meant to him. He\u2019d so hated being a laughingstock, and now she was going to have the comfort of hearing how he\u2019d changed history.</p><p>The tour guide was the same woman who\u2019d led her and Nicholas the first time, and Dougless smiled at the memory of Nicholas opening and closing the alarmed door.</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t pay much attention to the first part of the tour or listen to the guide. She just looked at the walls and furniture, and wondered what part of the design Nicholas had contributed.</p><p>\u201cAnd now we come to our most popular room,\u201d the guide said, and there was that same little smirk in her voice as before.</p><p>The guide had Dougless\u2019s full attention now, but something in her tone puzzled Dougless. Shouldn\u2019t the guide be more respectful now?</p><p>\u201cThis was Lord Nicholas Stafford\u2019s private chamber and, to put it politely, he was what is known as a rake.\u201d</p><p>The crowd moved forward, eager to hear of this notorious earl, but Dougless stood where she was. Things should have changed. When Nicholas went back, he meant to change history. Dougless had once said that history couldn\u2019t be changed. Had she been terribly, horribly right?</p><p>With several firm \u201cexcuse me\u2019s,\u201d Dougless pushed to the front of the group. The guide\u2019s talk was word for word as it had been the first time. She talked of Nicholas\u2019s devastating charm with the ladies, and she again told the awful story of Arabella and the table. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dougless felt as though she wanted to put her hands over her ears. Between the people in Ashburton not remembering Nicholas and now history being the same, it almost made her doubt whether any of what she remembered had happened. Was she crazy, just as Robert said? When she\u2019d so frantically asked the people of Ashburton if they\u2019d seen Nicholas, they had looked at her as though she were insane.</p><p>\u201cAlas,\u201d the guide was saying, \u201cpoor, charming Nick was executed for treason on the ninth of September, 1564. Now, if you\u2019ll step through here, we\u2019ll see the south drawing room.\u201d</p><p>Dougless\u2019s head shot up. Executed? No, Nicholas was found dead, slumped over his mother\u2019s letter.</p><p>Dougless made her way to the guide, who looked down her nose at Dougless. \u201cAh, the door opener,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t open the door, Ni . . .\u201d She halted. There was no use in explaining if this woman remembered her, not Nicholas, opening and closing the alarmed door. \u201cYou said that Lord Nicholas Stafford was executed. I heard that three days before the execution was to take place, he was found dead, slumped over a letter he was writing to his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was not,\u201d the woman said emphatically. \u201cHe was sentenced to death, and the sentence was carried out on schedule. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have a tour to conduct.\u201d</p><p>Dougless stood where she was for a moment, staring up at the portrait of Nicholas hanging over the fireplace. Executed? Beheaded? Something was deeply, sincerely wrong.</p><p>Turning, she started to leave, but on her way out she stopped at the door with the NO ADMITTANCE sign on it. Behind that door, down a few corridors, was the room that held the secret cabinet and in it the ivory box. Could she find the room and the cupboard door? She put out her hand to the knob.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t if I were you,\u201d someone behind her said.</p> <p>Dougless turned to see one of the guides, an unfriendly look on her face.</p><p>\u201cA few days ago some tourists went in there. We\u2019ve had to put a lock and an alarm on the door since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Dougless murmured. \u201cI thought it was a rest room.\u201d Turning away, she made her way out of the house, the guides outside frowning because she once again went out the entrance door.</p><p>She went to the gift shop and asked to buy anything they had on Nicholas Stafford.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a bit on him in the tour book but nowhere else. He didn\u2019t live long enough to accomplish much,\u201d the cashier said.</p><p>She asked if they\u2019d yet received postcards of his portrait, but they hadn\u2019t. Dougless bought the tour book, then went outside to the gardens. Finding the place where she and Nicholas had sat down to tea, that heavenly day when he\u2019d given her the pin, she began to read.</p> <p>In the fat, beautifully illustrated book, Nicholas rated only a short paragraph, and that was about the women and how he\u2019d raised an army against the queen and been executed for it.</p><p>Dougless leaned back against the tree. Even knowing the name of the man who\u2019d betrayed him hadn\u2019t helped. Nicholas still hadn\u2019t been able to persuade the queen of his innocence. And he hadn\u2019t even been able to destroy the diary written by that nasty little clerk that had left Nicholas\u2019s name blotted for all time. And, too, it seemed that now no one doubted Nicholas\u2019s guilt. The guidebook description, as brief as it was, portrayed Nicholas as a power-mad womanizer. And the tour group had chuckled when they\u2019d been told of Nicholas\u2019s execution.</p><p>Dougless closed her eyes and thought of her beautiful, proud, sweet Nicholas mounting the steps to a wide platform. Would it have been like in the movies, with a muscular man dressed in black leather holding a hideous-looking ax?</p><p>Her eyes flew open. She could not think of that. Could not think of Nicholas\u2019s beautiful head rolling across a wooden floor.</p><p>She stood up, picked up her heavy tote bag, left the grounds, and walked the two miles to the train station, where she bought a ticket to Thornwyck. Perhaps there, in the library, in their collection of books on the Stafford family, she\u2019d find some answers.</p><p>The librarian in Thornwyck welcomed her back, and in answer to Dougless\u2019s question, said she\u2019d never seen Dougless with a man. Dispirited, Dougless went to the Stafford books and began to read. Each and every book told of Nicholas\u2019s execution. No more did they tell of his dying before the execution and poison being suspected. And every book was as disdainful of Nicholas as it had been before. The notorious earl. The wastrel. The man who had everything and threw it away.</p><p>The librarian came to tell her the library was closing, so Dougless shut the last book and stood. She felt dizzy and swayed, catching herself against the table.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d the librarian asked.</p> <p>Dougless looked at the woman. The man she loved had just had his head cut off. No, she was far from all right. \u201cYes, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Dougless murmured. \u201cI\u2019m just tired and maybe a little hungry.\u201d She gave the woman a weak smile; then went outside.</p><p>Dougless stood in front of the library for a moment. She knew she should get a room somewhere, and she should eat something, but it didn\u2019t seem to matter. Over and over and over, she kept seeing Nicholas climbing the stairs to meet an executioner. Would his hands be tied behind his back? Would he have a priest with him? No, 1564 was after Henry the Eighth had abolished Catholicism. Who would have been with him?</p><p>She sat down on an iron bench and put her head in her hands. He had come to her and loved her and left her. For what? He had returned to a scaffolding and a bloody ax.</p><p>\u201cDougless? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>She looked up to see Lee Nolman standing over her.</p><p>\u201cI thought that was you. Nobody else has hair that color. I thought you left town.\u201d</p><p>When she stood up, she swayed against the bench.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right? You look terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little tired.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her closely, at the circles under her eyes and the gray tinge to her skin. \u201cAnd hungry, too, is my guess.\u201d Taking her arm firmly in his, he shouldered her bag. \u201cThere\u2019s a pub around the corner. Let\u2019s get something to eat.\u201d</p><p>Dougless allowed him to lead her down the street. What did she care what happened to her?</p><p>Inside the pub, he escorted her to a booth and ordered a couple of beers and some food. One sip of her beer and it went to her head, and Dougless realized she hadn\u2019t eaten since yesterday, when she\u2019d had breakfast with Nicholas\u2014and they\u2019d made love on the floor.</p><p>\u201cSo what have you been doing since you left Thornwyck last week?\u201d Lee asked.</p><p>\u201cNicholas and I went to Ashburton,\u201d she said, watching him.</p><p>\u201cHe somebody you met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cAnd what about you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled in a Cheshire cat way, as though he knew something very important. \u201cThe day after you left, Lord Harewood had the wall in Lady Margaret Stafford\u2019s room repaired, and guess what we found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRats,\u201d Dougless said, not caring about anything.</p><p>Lee leaned across the table conspiratorily. \u201cA little iron box, and in it Lady Margaret\u2019s story of the truth of why Lord Nicholas was executed. I tell you, Dougless, what was in that box is going to establish my reputation forever. It\u2019ll be like solving a four-hundred-year-old murder mystery.\u201d</p><p>It took a while for his words to penetrate Dougless\u2019s misery. \u201cTell me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Lee leaned back against the booth. \u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t. You coaxed Robert Sydney\u2019s name out of me, but not this story. If you want to know the whole story, you\u2019ll have to wait for the book.\u201d</p><p>Dougless started to speak, but the waitress appeared with their food. She didn\u2019t look at her cottage pie, but when she and Lee were again alone, she leaned across the table toward him. With an intensity Lee had never seen before in human eyes, Dougless said softly, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know about my family, but the Montgomerys are one of the richest families in the world. On my thirty-fifth birthday I will inherit millions. If you will tell me what Lady Margaret wrote, I will this minute sign one million dollars over to you.\u201d</p><p>Lee was too stunned to speak. He hadn\u2019t known about the wealth of her family, but he believed her. Nobody could have the look on her face that she did and be lying. He knew she wanted this information\u2014look how she\u2019d pestered him for Robert Sydney\u2019s name\u2014but he didn\u2019t feel like asking her why. If she was willing to offer a million dollars for the story, and if her family had as much money and power as she said, then it was rather like having a genie offer you one wish.</p><p>\u201cI want a chair in the history department of an Ivy League school,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Dougless answered, sounding like an auctioneer. She\u2019d donate a wing or a building to a college if she had to.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Lee said, \u201csettle back and eat. This is a great story. I may be able to sell it to the movies. The story starts years before poor ol\u2019 Nick was executed. He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d Dougless said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like to be called Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, okay, Nicholas then. What I\u2019d never read in any book\u2014I guess no historian thought it important\u2014was that the Stafford family had an obscure claim to the throne through Henry the Sixth. They were descended directly through the male line, while Queen Elizabeth was considered by some to be a bastard and, being a woman as well, therefore unfit to rule. You know that for years her throne was not exactly secure?\u201d</p><p>Dougless nodded.</p><p>\u201cIf the historians forgot that the Staffords were related to kings, there was someone who didn\u2019t. A woman named Lettice Culpin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do know your history,\u201d Lee said. \u201cYes, the beautiful Lettice. It seems that her family also had some claim to the throne of England, a claim even more obscure than the Staffords\u2019. Lady Margaret believed that Lettice was a very ambitious young woman. Her plan was to marry a Stafford, produce an heir, and put the child on the throne.\u201d</p><p>Dougless considered this. \u201cBut why Nicholas? Why not the older brother? It seems like she\u2019d want to marry the man who was earl.\u201d</p><p>Lee smiled. \u201cI have to keep on my toes with you, don\u2019t I? You\u2019re going to have to tell me where you learned so much about the Staffords. The eldest brother . . . ah . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristopher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Christopher was engaged to marry a very rich French heiress who happened to be only twelve years old. I guess he decided he\u2019d rather have the money from the heiress than have Lettice, no matter how beautiful she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Kit died and Nicholas became the earl,\u201d Dougless said softly.</p><p>\u201cLady Margaret hinted that her eldest son\u2019s death might not have been an accident. He drowned, but Lady Margaret said he was a strong swimmer. Anyway, she never knew for sure, she just guessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Lettice married the man who was to become the earl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lee said, \u201cbut things didn\u2019t go the way Lettice planned. It seems Nicholas wasn\u2019t interested in furthering himself at court, or in talking conspiracy and trying to find someone who\u2019d back him if he tried for the throne. Nicholas was mostly interested in women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd learning,\u201d Dougless shot at him. \u201cHe commissioned monks to copy books. He designed Thornwyck Castle. He\u2014\u201d She stopped.</p><p>Lee\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThat\u2019s true. Lady Margaret wrote all that, but how did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. What happened after Nicholas married . . . her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound as though you\u2019re jealous. Okay, okay. After they were married\u2014and Lettice seems to have quickly realized Nicholas wasn\u2019t going to do what she wanted him to\u2014she began to look around for some way to get rid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs she had Christopher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was never proven. It may have been a fortunate accident\u2014fortunate for Lettice anyway. Lady Margaret admitted that most of this was speculation, but after Lettice married Nicholas, he had some very close calls. A stirrup broke, a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he cut his calf,\u201d Dougless whispered, \u201cwhen he fell from the horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where he was hurt, Lady Margaret didn\u2019t say. Dougless, are you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d</p><p>She glared at him.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, Nicholas proved much harder to kill than Christopher had been, so Lettice began to look for someone to help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she found Robert Sydney.\u201d</p><p>Lee smiled. \u201cI bet you\u2019re great with detective novels, always figuring out the ending.</p><p>\u201cYes, Lettice found Robert Sydney. He was Arabella Harewood\u2019s husband, and he must have been pretty mad about all of England laughing about Stafford and his wife on the table. To make matters worse, nine months later, Arabella presented him with a black-haired son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the child and Arabella died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Lady Margaret thinks Sydney had a hand in those deaths.\u201d</p><p>Dougless took a breath. \u201cSo Lettice and Robert Sydney contrived to get Nicholas accused and executed for treason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Lady Margaret thinks Lettice just waited for an opportunity to get Nicholas for something, so when Stafford started gathering men to protect his Welsh estates, she informed Sydney, who rode hell-bent-for-leather to the queen. In a way, it\u2019s understandable that Elizabeth believed Sydney. Just months before, Mary Queen of Scots had declared herself queen of England as well as Scotland, and here was the earl of Thornwyck raising an army. Elizabeth just clapped Stafford in chains, had a mock trial with \u201csecret\u201d evidence, then whacked off Stafford\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>Dougless winced. \u201cSo Lettice and Robert Sydney went free.\u201d</p><p>Lee smiled. \u201cSort of. Actually, what happened after Stafford\u2019s execution was one of the great ironies of life. It seems that Lettice, who had planned everything so carefully, hadn\u2019t considered Robert Sydney\u2019s ambition. Lady Margaret thought Lettice planned to marry some English duke who was Elizabeth\u2019s cousin and start all over again, but Sydney had other plans. He threatened to tell the queen everything if Lettice didn\u2019t marry him. He wanted to put his kid on the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackmail,\u201d Dougless whispered.</p><p>\u201cRight. Blackmail. I told you this was like a movie. Or a best-seller. Maybe I should fictionalize this. Anyway, she was forced to marry Sydney.\u201d Lee gave a snort of laughter. \u201cWhat\u2019s really ironic about this whole story is that Lettice was barren. She never conceived at all, not even to miscarry. So she sent her first husband to the blade because of what she wanted for the child she planned to have; then she couldn\u2019t have children. Unbelievable, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dougless said through a closed throat. \u201cUnbelievable.\u201d She paused. \u201cWhat of Lady Margaret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither Lettice nor Sydney had any idea the old woman knew what they\u2019d done. No doubt they\u2019d have killed her if they\u2019d known, but she was a clever old broad and kept her mouth shut. Maybe she realized she couldn\u2019t prove anything. The queen confiscated everything she owned, so Sydney stepped in and offered her a choice between the pauper\u2019s farm or marrying his ex-father-in-law, Lord Harewood. Of course Sydney had an ulterior motive. Since he had three kids of Arabella\u2019s still alive, Lady Margaret\u2019s marriage made them obscurely related. It isn\u2019t much of a relationship by our standards today, but back then it was enough that Queen Elizabeth gave Sydney two of the Stafford estates.\u201d</p><p>He took a sip of his beer. \u201cAfter Lady Margaret married Harewood, she wrote everything down, put it in an iron chest, had some faithful old servant knock out part of a wall, and hid the box in there. As an afterthought, she put her letters in a chest and hid them too. Then the wall was sealed up.\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cIt was a good thing she did it when she did. According to a letter that\u2019s survived that was written by a friend of hers, two weeks later Lady Margaret was found dead at the bottom of a staircase, her neck broken. I guess after Mr. and Mrs. Sydney got the two Stafford estates, they had all they needed from her.\u201d</p> <p>Dougless leaned back against the booth and was silent for a while. \u201cWhat happened to them? To . . . Lettice and Robert Sydney?\u201d She could hardly bear to say the names.</p><p>\u201cRoasted in hell, I imagine. But actually, I don\u2019t know. I know that since they never had any kids, their estates passed into the hands of his nephew, who was a dissolute little bastard. In one generation the little creep managed to bankrupt the Sydney estates. It\u2019ll take more research to find out specifically what happened to Lettice and her husband. Historians haven\u2019t been too interested in them.\u201d He smiled. \u201cUp to now, that is. History will change after I write my book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo change history,\u201d Dougless whispered. That\u2019s what Nicholas had wanted to do, but all they\u2019d managed was to make his execution happen. \u201cI have to go,\u201d she said abruptly.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you staying? I\u2019ll walk you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have reservations.\u201d Her head came up. \u201cBut I plan to stay at Thornwyck Castle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, don\u2019t we all? You have to book a year in advance to get into that place. Wait a minute, don\u2019t look so sad. I\u2019ll call.\u201d He walked away and minutes later returned, grinning. \u201cYou are one lucky devil. They had a cancellation, so you can check in now. I\u2019ll walk you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dougless said. \u201cI need to be alone. Thanks for dinner, and thanks for telling me. And I\u2019ll see that you get your chair at an Ivy League school.\u201d She put out her hand to shake his, then turned and left the pub.</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>At Thornwyck no one remembered Nicholas. Dougless looked back through the guest register, and where Nicholas had signed the book, an unfamiliar hand had written \u201cMiss Dougless Montgomery.\u201d Listlessly, she put her tote bag in the single room, then went outside to look at the unfinished part of the castle. This time, it had never been finished because Nicholas had been executed.</p><p>As she looked at the roofless walls, at the vines hanging down them, she remembered every word of what Nicholas had told her about what he\u2019d planned for this place. A center of learning, he\u2019d said. Yet all his plans had come to nothing.</p><p>When he\u2019d left her yesterday, had he gone back to his cell? she wondered. Had he gone back to the time when he\u2019d been writing his mother and trying to find out who had betrayed him? What had he done in those three days before his execution? Would no one listen to him when he told them of Robert Sydney\u2019s lies?</p> <p>Wearily, she leaned back against a wall. Whom had he told about Robert Sydney? Lettice? Had his beloved wife come to visit him? Had he told her what he knew and asked for her help?</p><p>Irony, Dougless thought. Lee had said all of it was ironic. The true irony was that Nicholas had died because he was good. He\u2019d refused to commit treason with his wife, refused to even consider it\u2014and he\u2019d died for it. Not a quick, honorable death, but a death that was public and meant to ridicule him. He\u2019d lost his life, his honor, his name, his estates, and the respect of future generations, all because he\u2019d refused to conspire with a power-mad woman.</p><p>\u201cIt is wrong!\u201d Dougless said aloud. \u201cWhat happened was wrong.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she walked back to the hotel, and as though in a trance, she showered, put on her nightgown, then went to bed. She lay awake for a long time, anger not allowing her to sleep. Irony, she thought. Treason. Betrayal. Blackmail. The words tumbled about in her head.</p><p>Toward dawn she fell into a fitful sleep, and when she awoke, she felt worse than she had before she went to bed. Feeling a thousand pounds heavier and very old, she dressed and went downstairs to breakfast.</p><p>Nicholas had been given a second chance, and he had asked her, Dougless, for help, but she had failed him. She had been so jealous of Arabella that she\u2019d lost sight of the true purpose of why they\u2019d been at the Harewoods. When she should have been searching for information, she had been worrying about whether Nicholas and Arabella were touching each other. Well, no one was going to touch Nicholas now\u2014not in the twentieth century or in the sixteenth.</p><p>She ate, she checked out, and she walked to the train station and boarded a train going back to Ashburton. Somewhere during that train ride her failures stopped plaguing her and she began to ask herself what could be done now. Would the publication of Lee\u2019s book help to clear Nicholas\u2019s name? Perhaps if she volunteered her services as his secretary and helped him research, she could somewhat make up for how she\u2019d failed to help Nicholas when he was in the twentieth century.</p><p>She leaned her head against the train window. If only she had it to do over again, she wouldn\u2019t be jealous and she wouldn\u2019t waste their precious time together. When she was at Goshawk Hall, why hadn\u2019t she asked Lee if there were any other secrets hidden behind the wall? Why hadn\u2019t she looked? Why hadn\u2019t she torn down that wall with her own bare hands?!! Why hadn\u2019t she\u2014</p> <p>When the sign for Ashburton appeared out the window, she got off the train. As she walked, she realized that there was nothing she could do. The time to help was past. Lee could write his book himself and she was sure he\u2019d do a great job of it. Robert had his daughter, so he didn\u2019t need Dougless. Nicholas had been the one who needed her, but she\u2019d failed him.</p><p>There was nothing more for her to do but go home.</p><p>Leaving the train station, she started toward the hotel. She would call the airlines and see if she could get a flight home immediately. Perhaps if she returned to familiar surroundings, she could begin to forgive herself.</p><p>As she walked, she went past the church that contained Nicholas\u2019s tomb and her feet seemed to turn toward the gate of their own accord. The church was empty inside, the sunlight streaming down through the stained-glass windows to gently touch Nicholas\u2019s tomb. The pale white of the marble looked cold and dead.</p><p>Slowly, Dougless walked toward the tomb. Perhaps if she prayed, Nicholas would return. Perhaps if she begged God, He\u2019d let Nicholas come back to her. If she could just see him for five minutes, she thought. That\u2019s all she\u2019d need to tell Nicholas of his wife\u2019s treachery.</p><p>But as she touched the cold marble cheek, she knew it wouldn\u2019t work. What had happened was a once-in-a-century happening. She\u2019d been given a chance to save a man\u2019s life and she\u2019d failed.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d she whispered, and for the first time since he\u2019d gone, tears came to her eyes. They were hot, thick tears that blurred her vision.</p><p>\u201cI am onion-eyed again,\u201d she said, almost smiling. \u201cI am so sorry for failing you, my darling Nicholas. But I don\u2019t seem to be much good at anything. But before now I never had anyone die because of my shortcomings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d she whispered, then turned around to sit on the edge of the tomb. \u201cHow do I live with your blood on my hands?\u201d</p><p>She unzipped her bag that was still hanging from her shoulder and rummaged inside for a tissue. She pulled out a soft travel pack, then took out a tissue. As she blew her nose, she saw a piece of paper fall from the tissue pack to the floor. Bending, she picked it up and looked at it.</p><p>It was the note Nicholas had written and slipped under her door.</p><p>\u201cThe note,\u201d she said, standing up straight. It was the note written in Nicholas\u2019s own hand! It was something that he had touched, something that was . . . that was proof, she thought.</p><p>\u201cOh, Nicholas,\u201d she said, and the tears began in earnest then, real tears, deep, deep tears of grief. Her legs gave way beneath her and she slid slowly to the stone floor, the note held to her cheek. \u201cI am sorry, Nicholas,\u201d she cried. \u201cVery, very sorry that I failed you.\u201d</p><p>She leaned her forehead against the cold marble tomb, her body huddled in a knot. \u201cDear God,\u201d she whispered, \u201cplease help me to forgive myself.\u201d</p><p>Dougless, in her grief, was unaware of the way the light came in through the stained glass and touched her hair. The window depicted an angel kneeling and praying, and the light came through the angel\u2019s halo to touch Dougless\u2019s hair, and as a cloud moved, the sunlight touched Nicholas\u2019s marble hand.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Dougless whispered, \u201cplease.\u201d</p><p>It was at that moment that Dougless heard laughter. Not just any laughter, but Nicholas\u2019s laughter.</p><p>\u201cNicholas?\u201d she whispered, then lifted her head, blinking to clear her vision. There was no one in the church.</p><p>Awkwardly, she rose. \u201cNicholas?\u201d she said louder, then turned abruptly when she heard the laughter again, this time behind her. She reached out her hand, but there was no one, nothing, there.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, standing up straight; then louder, \u201cYes.\u201d She raised her face to the sunlight and to the angel in the window. Closing her eyes, she put her head back. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Suddenly, Dougless felt as though someone had punched her in the stomach. Doubled over in pain, she fell forward onto her knees on the stone floor. When she tried to get up, she felt dizzy and as though she were going to throw up. She had to get to a rest room, she thought. She couldn\u2019t befoul the church.</p><p>But when she tried to move, nothing happened. It was as though her body were no longer obeying her brain. \u201cNicholas,\u201d she whispered, then reached out her hand toward his tomb, but the next moment everything went black and she collapsed to the floor.</p><p>TWENTY - ONE</p><p>When she awoke, she felt dizzy and weak and wasn\u2019t sure where she was. She opened her eyes to see blue sky overhead and a leafy tree nearby.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d she whispered. Had she wandered out of the church? But the sight of the sky and the tree had calmed her. For the first time in days she didn\u2019t feel frantic.</p><p>She closed her eyes again. She was so weak she felt like staying where she was and taking a nap. She would figure out where she was later.</p><p>As she began to doze, she was vaguely aware of a feminine giggle nearby. Kids, she thought. Children playing.</p><p>But at the sound of a male\u2019s responding laughter, her eyes opened. \u201cNicholas?\u201d Slowly, still feeling disoriented, she sat up and looked around. She was sitting on the grass under a tree in a pretty part of the English countryside. Turning about, she tried to get her bearings. When had she left the church?</p><p>Dougless stopped turning when she saw a man in a field. He was far away and difficult to distinguish, but he seemed to be wearing a sort of short brown robe and he was plowing a field with an ox. Dougless blinked her eyes, but the vision didn\u2019t change. Rural England was indeed rural.</p><p>Behind her came the woman\u2019s giggle again. \u201cSir Nicholas,\u201d the woman said in a dreamy sort of way.</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t think about what she did; she merely reacted. Leaping to her feet, she went to the bushes behind her and shoved her way through them.</p><p>There on the ground, rolling about was Nicholas. Her Nicholas. His shirt was half off, and his strong arms were about a plump girl whose top half was coming out of an odd-looking dress.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d Dougless said loudly, \u201chow could you? How could you do this to me?\u201d Tears were starting again. \u201cI\u2019ve been crazy with worry about you, and here you are with . . . with this . . . Oh, Nicholas, how could you?\u201d She took a tissue from her pocket and blew her nose loudly.</p><p>On the ground, Nicholas and the girl stopped moving. The girl, with frightened movements, hastily tied the front of her dress, scurried out from under Nicholas, then ran off through the hedges.</p><p>Nicholas, a scowl on his handsome face, turned over, leaned back on one elbow, and looked up at Dougless. \u201cWhat mean you by this?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Dougless\u2019s first reaction of anger left her. For a moment she stood staring down at him. Nicholas was here with her. Here!</p><p>She leaped on him, her arms fastening about his neck as she began kissing his face. His arms went around her as they fell back against the ground.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, it is you. It is. Oh, my darling, it was awful after you left. No one remembered you. Nobody remembered us together.\u201d She kissed his neck. \u201cYou\u2019ve grown your beard back, but that\u2019s okay, I kinda like it.\u201d</p><p>He was kissing her neck. His hand was on her shirt front, and her blouse easily parted as his lips moved down her throat.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, I have so much to tell you. I saw Lee after you left, and he told me all about Lettice and Robert Sydney . . . and . . . Oh, that\u2019s nice, that\u2019s very nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she said abruptly, then pushed him to arm\u2019s length. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t do this. You remember what happened the last time, don\u2019t you? We have to talk. I have so many things to tell you. Did you know that you were executed after all?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stopped trying to pull her back into his arms. \u201cI? Executed? Pray, madam, for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor treason, of course, and for raising the army. For\u2014Nicholas, don\u2019t you lose your memory too. I\u2019ve had all the amnesia I can take lately. Listen to me. I don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ll stay here before you go back. Your wife planned everything. I know you love her, but she only married you because you\u2019re related to Queen Elizabeth\u2014or is it the queen\u2019s father? Anyway, Lettice wants you out of the picture because you won\u2019t play along with her and put her kid on the throne. Of course she can\u2019t have any kids, but she doesn\u2019t know that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She paused. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make for my home, away from your Colley-westonward talk.\u201d He stood up, then began to tuck his shirt into his balloon shorts.</p><p>Dougless rose too. \u201c\u2018Colley-westonward.\u2019 That\u2019s a new one on me. Nicholas, wait, you can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to face her. \u201cIf you desire to finish what you began\u201d\u2014he nodded toward the ground\u2014\u201cI will remain and I will pay you well, but I cannot abide this deboshed manner of speaking.\u201d</p> <p>Dougless stood there blinking at him, trying to understand what he was saying. \u201cPay me?\u201d she whispered. \u201cNicholas, what\u2019s wrong with you? You act as though you\u2019ve never seen me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, madam, I have not,\u201d he said, then turned his back to her and left the clearing.</p><p>Dougless was too stunned to move. Never seen her before? What was he talking about? She pushed through the bushes. Nicholas was dressed in the most extraordinary clothes. His black satin jacket seemed to be decorated with . . .</p><p>\u201cAre those diamonds?\u201d she gasped.</p><p>Nicholas narrowed his eyes at her. \u201cI do not deal kindly with thieves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning to rob you; it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve never seen anyone who had diamonds on his clothes before.\u201d Stepping back, she looked at him, really looked at him, and she saw that he was different. It wasn\u2019t just the clothes or that he was again wearing his beard and mustache, but there was a seriousness missing from his face. This was Nicholas, but he somehow seemed younger.</p><p>How could he have grown his beard back so soon?</p><p>\u201cNicholas?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhen you were last home, not the first time you came to me, but this time, what year was it?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas slipped a short cloak of black satin that was trimmed in ermine about his shoulders, and from behind the bushes he pulled a horse, an animal as wild-looking as the rented Sugar had been. Easily, he vaulted into a saddle that was as big as an American cowboy\u2019s saddle, but it had tall wooden uprights in front of and in back of the seat. \u201cWhen last I was home this morn, it was the year of our Lord 1560. Now, you, witch, get from my sight.\u201d</p><p>Dougless had to step back against the bushes to keep from being run down by the horse. \u201cNicholas, wait!\u201d she called, but he was gone.</p><p>Disbelieving, Dougless stared after him until he was little more than a speck on the horizon; then she sat down on a big rock, her head in her hands. Now what? she thought. Did she have to start all over again and explain to him yet again all about the twentieth century? The last time she\u2019d seen him, he\u2019d come from 1564, but this time it was four years earlier. What had happened hadn\u2019t happened yet.</p> <p>Her head came up. Of course! That was it. When he\u2019d found out about Robert Sydney, he\u2019d been in jail\u2014or the medieval equivalent thereof\u2014and he couldn\u2019t do much about saving himself. But this time he\u2019d come forward four years earlier. Now there was time to prevent what had caused his execution.</p><p>Feeling a great deal more cheerful, she stood up. She had to go find him before he did something dumb, like walk in front of a bus again. Picking up her heavy tote bag from the ground, she slung it over her shoulder, then started walking in the direction Nicholas had gone.</p><p>The road was the worst she\u2019d ever seen: deep ruts, rocks sticking up, narrow and weed-choked. The roads in rural America weren\u2019t this bad, and she\u2019d never seen anything like this before in England.</p><p>She stepped to the side of the road when she heard a vehicle coming around a corner. A tired-looking donkey was pulling a cart that had two big wooden wheels. Beside the cart walked a man wearing a short dress that looked as though it\u2019d been made from a burlap bag. His legs, bare from mid-calf down, had great ugly sores on them. Dougless stared at him in openmouthed astonishment, and the man turned and gaped at her in the same way. His face was like leather, and when he opened his mouth, Dougless could see rotten teeth. He looked her up and down, his eyes fastening on her stocking-clad legs; then he leered at her, grinning and showing off his hideous teeth.</p><p>Quickly, Dougless turned away and started walking rapidly. The road got worse, the ruts deeper, and there was manure everywhere. \u201cEngland\u2019s using manure to fill the ruts now?\u201d she muttered.</p><p>At the top of a little hill she stopped and looked down. Below her were three little houses, tiny places with thatched roofs and bare ground in front of them where chickens and ducks and children scratched about. A woman wearing a long skirt came out the front door of one hut and emptied a round container beside the door.</p><p>Dougless started down the hill. Perhaps she could ask directions of the woman. But as she neared the houses, she slowed. She could smell the place. Animals, people, rotting food, piles of manure, all of it reeked. Dougless put her hand to her nose and breathed through her mouth. Really! she thought, the English government should do something about this place. People shouldn\u2019t live like this.</p><p>She went to the first house, trying to keep her shoes clean but not succeeding very well. A child, about three, wearing a filthy nightgown, looked up at her. The poor thing looked as though it hadn\u2019t been washed in a year, and it obviously wasn\u2019t wearing a diaper. Dougless vowed that when she got Nicholas straightened out, she was going to complain about this place to the English government. It was a health hazard.</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d she called into the dark interior of the house. It didn\u2019t seem to smell much better inside than out. \u201cHello? Is anybody home?\u201d</p><p>No one answered, but Dougless felt as though she were being watched. When she turned, she saw three women and a couple of children behind her. The women weren\u2019t any cleaner than the child she\u2019d seen, their long dresses encrusted with food and no telling what else.</p><p>Dougless tried smiling. \u201cExcuse me, but I\u2019m looking for the Ashburton church. I seem to have lost my way.\u201d</p><p>The women didn\u2019t speak, but one woman stepped toward Dougless. It was difficult to keep smiling, for the woman reeked of body odor.</p><p>\u201cDo you know the way to Ashburton?\u201d Dougless repeated.</p><p>The woman just walked around Dougless, staring at her, looking at her clothes, her hair, her face.</p><p>\u201cA bunch of looney tunes,\u201d Dougless muttered. Living in filth as they did, they probably weren\u2019t too bright. She stepped away from the stinking woman and unzipped her tote bag. The woman jumped back at the sound. Dougless took out her map of southern England and looked at it, but it didn\u2019t help any because she didn\u2019t know where she was, so she couldn\u2019t figure out how to get where she was going.</p><p>She lowered the map when she realized one of the women was very near, her head almost inside Dougless\u2019s bag. \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d she said sharply. The woman\u2019s head was covered with a cloth that was caked with dirt and grease.</p><p>The woman jumped away but not before she\u2019d snatched Dougless\u2019s sunglasses from her bag. She ran back to the other women, and the three of them examined the glasses.</p><p>\u201cThis is too much.\u201d Dougless strode toward the women, her foot slipping in something, but she didn\u2019t look down. \u201cMay I have those back?\u201d</p><p>The women looked at her with hard faces. One of them had deep, pitted scars on her neck, and she held the sunglasses behind her back.</p><p>Dougless put her hands to her sides. \u201cWould you please return my property?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe gone with you,\u201d one of the women said, and Dougless saw that three upper teeth were missing and two others were rotten.</p><p>It was then that she began to understand. She looked at the house before her, saw the firewood stacked outside, saw the onions hanging from the roof. The dirt, the carts, the people who had never heard of a dentist.</p><p>\u201cWho is your queen?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cElizabeth,\u201d one woman said in an odd accent.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Dougless whispered, \u201cand who was her mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe witch Anne Bullen.\u201d</p><p>The women were gathering around her now, but Dougless was too stunned to notice. Nicholas had said that this morning it had been 1560; then he\u2019d ridden off on a horse with a funny saddle. He hadn\u2019t seemed disoriented or unsure of where he was going. He hadn\u2019t acted as he had when he\u2019d first arrived in the twentieth century. Instead, he\u2019d acted as though he were right at home.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d Dougless said, for one of the women had pulled her hair.</p><p>\u201cBe ye a witch?\u201d one of the women asked, standing very close to Dougless.</p><p>Suddenly, Dougless was afraid. It was one thing to laugh at a man in the twentieth century for calling someone a witch, but in the sixteenth century people were burned for being witches.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not a witch,\u201d Dougless said, backing away, but there was a woman behind her.</p><p>A woman pulled on Dougless\u2019s sleeve. \u201cWitch\u2019s clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course they aren\u2019t. I live . . . ah, in another village, that\u2019s all. Next year you\u2019ll all be wearing this.\u201d She couldn\u2019t go back or forward, for the surrounding women were blocking her. You\u2019d better think fast, Dougless, she thought, or you just might be this evening\u2019s barbecue. While keeping an eye on the women, she put her hand into her tote bag, digging for she knew not what. Her hand lit on a book of matches she\u2019d taken from a hotel somewhere.</p><p>She pulled out the matches, tore off one, and struck it. With a gasp the women moved back. \u201cIn the house,\u201d she said, holding the lit match at arm\u2019s length. \u201cGo on, get in the house.\u201d</p><p>The women backed up and stepped inside the doorway just as the match burned down to Dougless\u2019s fingertips. She dropped the match and began to run.</p><p>Leaving the stinking houses and the rutted road behind, she ran into the woods. When she was out of breath, she sat down on the ground and leaned back against a tree.</p><p>It appeared that when she\u2019d passed out in the church, she\u2019d awakened in the sixteenth century. So here she was, alone\u2014Nicholas didn\u2019t know her\u2014in a time before soap was invented\u2014or at least before it was used much\u2014and the people seemed to regard her as something evil.</p><p>\u201cSo how am I to tell Nicholas all he needs to know if I don\u2019t even see him?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The first drops of rain were cold on Dougless. She pulled an umbrella from her travel bag and opened it. It was at that moment that she really looked at her beat-up old carry-on. She\u2019d had the thing for years. It had traveled with her wherever she\u2019d gone, and she\u2019d gradually filled it with everything anyone could need while traveling. Inside were cosmetics, medicines, toiletries, a sewing kit, an office kit, magazines, a nightgown, airline nut packages, felt-tip pens, and there was no telling what was in the very bottom.</p><p>She pulled the bag under the umbrella with her, feeling as though the bag were her only friend. Think, Dougless, think, she told herself. She had to tell Nicholas what he must know; then she had to get back to her own time. Already she knew that she didn\u2019t want to stay in this backward place with its filthy, ignorant people. In just this short time she was already missing hot showers and electric blankets.</p><p>She huddled under the umbrella as the rain started coming down harder. The ground under her was getting wet, and she thought of sitting on a magazine, but who knows? She might end up selling the magazines in order to live.</p><p>She put her head down on her knees. \u201cOh, Nicholas, where are you?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Then she remembered the evening of the first day she\u2019d met him and how she\u2019d been in that toolshed crying. He\u2019d come to her then, and later he\u2019d said he\u2019d heard her \u201ccalling.\u201d If it worked then, maybe it would work now.</p><p>With her head down, she concentrated on asking Nicholas to come to her. She visualized his riding up to her; then she thought of all their time together. She smiled, remembering a dinner, chosen by her, that their landlady had cooked for them: corn-on-the-cob, avocados, barbecued spareribs, and a mango for dessert. Nicholas had laughed like a small boy. She remembered the music he\u2019d played, his delight over the books, how critical he had been of modern clothes.</p><p>\u201cCome to me, Nicholas,\u201d she whispered. \u201cCome to me.\u201d</p><p>It was dusk and the rain was coming down hard and cold when Nicholas appeared, sitting atop his big black horse.</p><p>She grinned up at him. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come.\u201d</p><p>He did not smile but instead glared down at her in anger. \u201cLady Margaret would see you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYour mother? Your mother wants to see me?\u201d She couldn\u2019t be sure because of the rain, but he seemed to be momentarily shocked at her words. \u201cAll right,\u201d Dougless said, rising, then handing him her umbrella and raising her hand for him to help her onto his horse.</p><p>To her disbelief, he took the umbrella, examined it with interest, then held it over his own head and rode off, leaving Dougless standing with rain pelting down on her. \u201cOf all the\u2014\u201d she began. Was she supposed to walk while he rode?</p><p>She moved back to the relative dryness under the tree, and after a while Nicholas returned, the umbrella held over him.</p><p>\u201cYou are to come with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAm I supposed to go on foot?\u201d she yelled up at him. \u201cYou ride while I slog along in the mud and muck behind you? And you use my umbrella? Is that what you had in mind?\u201d</p><p>He seemed confused for a moment. \u201cYour speech is most strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as strange as your outdated ideas. Nicholas, I am cold and hungry and getting wetter by the minute. Help me on your horse and let\u2019s go see your mother.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas gave a bit of a smile at her insolent attitude, then held down his hand for her. Dougless took it, put her foot on his, and swung onto the back of the horse\u2014not into the saddle with him but onto the hard, unsteady rump of the horse. Dougless put her arms around Nicholas\u2019s waist, but he pried her loose and pushed her hands down to the high back of the saddle, then handed her the umbrella.</p><p>\u201cHold this over me,\u201d he said, and kicked the horse forward.</p><p>Dougless wanted to make a retort, but all her attention was on holding on to the horse. She had to use two hands to hold on, so the umbrella hung uselessly to the side as they sped along. Through the rain she saw more hovels, more people working in the rain, apparently oblivious of it. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll wash them,\u201d she muttered, hanging on as best she could.</p><p>Because she was behind Nicholas and he was too tall to see over, she didn\u2019t see the house until they were in front of it. There was a tall stone wall before them, and behind it stood a three-story stone house.</p><p>A man wearing clothes somewhat like Nicholas\u2019s\u2014no burlap dress but no diamonds either\u2014came running to take the horse\u2019s reins. Nicholas dismounted, then stood impatiently by, slapping his gloves against his palm, while Dougless struggled down by herself, lugging her heavy bag and the umbrella. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she was down, the servant opened the gate and Nicholas went through it, seeming to expect Dougless to follow him. She hurried after him, down a brick path, up a flight of stairs, across a brick terrace, and into the house.</p><p>A solemn-faced servant stood inside, waiting to take Nicholas\u2019s cloak and wet hat. When Dougless closed the umbrella, Nicholas took it from her and looked inside, obviously trying to figure out how it worked. After the way he\u2019d been treating her, she wasn\u2019t about to tell him. She snatched the umbrella from his hands and gave it to the wide-eyed servant. \u201cThis is mine,\u201d she said to the servant. \u201cRemember that, and don\u2019t let anyone else have it.\u201d</p><p>Looking at her, Nicholas snorted. Dougless hitched her bag onto her shoulder and glared back at him. She was beginning to believe that he was not the man she\u2019d fallen in love with. Her Nicholas wouldn\u2019t have made a woman ride on the back of a horse.</p><p>Turning away, he started up the stairs, and Dougless, dripping and cold, followed him. She had only a brief glimpse of the house, but it didn\u2019t look like the Elizabethan houses she\u2019d seen on guided tours. For one thing, the wood wasn\u2019t darkened from being four hundred years old. The walls were paneled in golden oak, and everywhere there was color. The plaster above the panels was painted with scenes of people in a meadow. There were bright, pretty new tapestries and painted cloths hanging on the walls. There were silver plates gleaming from tabletops. And under her feet, oddly enough, there seemed to be straw. Upstairs there were carved pieces of furniture in the hall, looking as new as though they\u2019d been made last week. On one table was a tall pitcher that had beautiful, deep fluting on it. It was of a yellow metal that could only be gold.</p> <p>Before Dougless could ask about the pitcher, Nicholas opened a door and strode inside.</p><p>\u201cI have brought the witch,\u201d she heard Nicholas say.</p><p>\u201cNow, just a minute,\u201d Dougless said, then, hurrying into the room behind him, she stopped. She had entered a beautiful room. It was large, with tall ceilings, the walls paneled with more of the beautiful oak, the plaster above painted with colorful birds, butterflies, and animals. The furniture, the window seat, and the enormous bed were draped with hangings of brilliant silk, and dotted with cushions, all of it embroidered in gold and silver and brightly colored thread. Everything in the room, from cups and pitchers, to a mirror and comb, seemed to be a precious object, made of gold or silver, encrusted with jewels. The whole room glittered beautifully.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness,\u201d Dougless said in awe.</p><p>\u201cBring her to me,\u201d said an imperious voice.</p> <p>Dougless pulled her eyes away from the room to look at the bed. Behind its exquisitely carved posts, behind scarlet silk hangings that twinkled with flowers embroidered in gold thread, lay a stern-looking woman wearing a white nightgown with black embroidery on the cuffs and ruffled neck. About her eyes Dougless could see a resemblance to Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d she commanded, and Dougless moved closer.</p><p>The woman\u2019s voice, for all its command, sounded tired and stuffy, as though she had a cold.</p><p>It was when Dougless was closer to the foot of the bed that she saw that the woman had her left arm stretched across a pillow, and a man, wearing a long, voluminous robe of black velvet, was bending over her and tending to . . .</p><p>\u201cAre those leeches?\u201d Dougless gasped. Slimy little black worms seemed to be stuck on the woman\u2019s arm.</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t see Lady Margaret exchange looks with her son.</p> <p>\u201cI have been told you are a witch, that you make fire from your fingertips.\u201d</p><p>Dougless couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the leeches. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it hurts,\u201d the woman said in dismissal. \u201cI would see this magic of fire.\u201d</p><p>The distaste Dougless felt at seeing the leeches on the woman\u2019s arm overrode her fear of being called a witch. She walked to the side of the bed and put her tote bag on top of a table, pushing aside a pretty silver box that had emeralds across the top. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let that man do that to you. It sounds to me like you just have a bad cold. Headache? Sneezing? Tired?\u201d</p><p>Wide-eyed, the woman stared at her and nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d She rummaged in her bag. \u201cIf you\u2019ll make that man take those nasty things away, I\u2019ll fix your cold. Ah, here they are. Cold tablets.\u201d She held up the package.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Nicholas said, stepping forward, \u201cyou cannot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe still, Nicholas,\u201d Lady Margaret said. \u201cAnd remove those from my arm,\u201d she ordered the physician.</p> <p>The man pulled the leeches from Lady Margaret\u2019s arm, dropped them into a little leather-bound box, then stepped away from the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need a glass of water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWine!\u201d Lady Margaret commanded, and Nicholas handed her a tall silver goblet studded with rough-cut jewels.</p><p>Dougless was aware of the unnatural hush in the room, and suddenly she realized how brave Lady Margaret was. Or how dumb, she couldn\u2019t help thinking, since she was taking medicine from a stranger. Dougless handed her a cold tablet. \u201cSwallow it and in about twenty minutes it should work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Nicholas began, but Lady Margaret waved him away as she swallowed the capsule.</p><p>\u201cIf she is harmed, you will pay,\u201d Nicholas said into Dougless\u2019s ear, and Dougless swallowed. What if the Elizabethan body wasn\u2019t ready for cold tablets? What if Lady Margaret was allergic?</p><p>Dougless stood where she was, still dripping water and beginning to shiver from cold. Her hair was plastered to her head, but no one had offered her a towel. No one in the room seemed to breathe as they looked at Lady Margaret lying against the embroidered pillows. Shifting nervously, Dougless became aware of another person in the room. Near the bed curtains was another woman. Dougless could just see the shape of her in a dress with a tight bodice above a full skirt.</p><p>When Dougless coughed, Nicholas, at the foot of the bed, gave her a sharp look.</p><p>It was the longest twenty minutes of Dougless\u2019s life as she stood there, cold and nervous, and waited for the pill to take effect. When it did work, it worked quickly. Lady Margaret\u2019s sinuses cleared and she lost that awful stuffy feeling of having a cold.</p><p>Lady Margaret sat up straighter, her eyes wide. \u201cI am cured,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Dougless answered. \u201cThe pills just mask the symptoms. You should stay in bed and drink lots of orange juice . . . or whatever.\u201d</p><p>The woman behind Dougless came bustling from the shadows, leaned over Lady Margaret, and tucked the covers around her.</p><p>\u201cI am well, I tell you,\u201d Lady Margaret said. \u201cYou! Go!\u201d she said to the physician, and he backed out of the room. \u201cNicholas, take her, feed her, dry her, clothe her, and bring her to me on the morrow. Early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI?\u201d Nicholas said haughtily. \u201cI?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have found her, you are responsible for her. Now go.\u201d</p><p>When Nicholas looked at Dougless, he curled his upper lip. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, and there was anger as well as distaste in his voice.</p><p>She followed him out of the room, and once they were in the hall, she said, \u201cNicholas, we must talk.\u201d</p><p>He turned on her, still wearing that expression of distaste. \u201cNay, madam, we do not talk.\u201d He arched one eyebrow. \u201cAnd I am Sir Nicholas, Knight of the Realm.\u201d Turning on his heel, he walked away.</p><p>\u201cSir Nicholas?\u201d she asked. \u201cNot Lord Nicholas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am but a knight. My brother is lord.\u201d</p><p>Dougless stopped walking. \u201cBrother? You mean Kit? Kit is alive?\u201d</p><p>When Nicholas turned toward her, his face was distorted with rage. \u201cI do not know who you are or how you come to know of my family, but I warn you, witch, you harm one person\u2014should a hair on my mother\u2019s head change color\u2014and you will forfeit your life in payment. And do not think to use your witchcraft on my brother.\u201d</p><p>He turned again and started walking. Dougless followed, but she didn\u2019t say anything. Great, just great, she thought. She\u2019d come all the way back across four hundred years to save Nicholas\u2019s head, and all he could do was threaten to kill her. How was she going to make him listen?</p><p>They went upstairs to the top floor, and Nicholas threw open a door. \u201cYou sleep here.\u201d</p><p>She stepped inside. This was no pretty room filled with treasures. It was a cell with one tiny window high up on the wall, and little more than a lumpy mattress in a corner, with a filthy wool blanket on top. \u201cI can\u2019t stay here,\u201d Dougless said, horrified. But when she turned, she saw that Nicholas had left the room and shut the door behind him. She heard a key turn in a lock.</p><p>She yelled and pounded on the heavy door, but he didn\u2019t open it. \u201cYou bastard!\u201d she shouted, then slid down the door to the floor. \u201cYou rotten bastard,\u201d she whispered, alone in the dark room.</p><p>TWENTY - TWO</p><p>No one came to release Dougless that night or the next morning. She had no water, no food, and very little light. There was an old wooden bucket in a corner, and she assumed this was to relieve herself in. She tried lying on the mattress, but within minutes she felt little things crawling on her skin. Clawing herself, she jumped out of the bed and pressed herself against the cold stone wall.</p><p>She could tell when morning came only because the room changed to a lighter shade of gloom. During the long night she\u2019d scratched at whatever was on her skin so much that places were bleeding. Expectantly, she waited for someone to release her. Lady Margaret had said she wanted to see Dougless early. But no one came.</p><p>By holding her arm up to a narrow ray of light coming in through the window, she could see her wristwatch, and if it was set correctly for Elizabethan time, at noon still no one had come to release her.</p><p>She tried to keep her mind active and not give in to despair, so she repeatedly went over everything Lee had told her about the events leading up to Nicholas\u2019s execution. Somehow she had to warn Nicholas. Somehow she had to prevent Lettice and Robert Sydney from using Nicholas.</p><p>But how could she do anything when she was locked away in a dark, flea-ridden room? And not only wouldn\u2019t Nicholas listen to her, he seemed to hate her. She tried to remember what she\u2019d said when she\u2019d first seen him yesterday that had so offended him. Was it her references to his beloved Lettice?</p><p>It was cold in the room, and Dougless shivered as she scratched at her itching scalp. In the twentieth century she had always had the Montgomery name and money to fall back on. Even though she was years from inheriting, she\u2019d always known the money was there, that she could offer a million dollars for information she desperately needed.</p><p>But here in the sixteenth century she had nothing, was nothing. All she had was a travel bag full of modern wonders. And she had her knowledge of what was to come. And somehow she had to persuade these people that they couldn\u2019t just toss her into a prison and leave her to rot. The first time Nicholas had come to her, she\u2019d failed to find the information needed to stop his execution, but this time she would not fail. This time she was going to succeed no matter what she had to do.</p><p>As she thought of these things, energy began to replace her lethargy. Her father loved to tell his daughters stories of their ancestors, of the Montgomerys in Scotland, in England, and in early America. There was one story after another of heroic deeds and near escapes.</p><p>\u201cIf they can do it, so can I,\u201d Dougless said aloud. \u201cNicholas,\u201d she said firmly, \u201ccome release me from this hideous place.\u201d Closing her eyes, she concentrated, imagining Nicholas coming to her.</p><p>It didn\u2019t seem to take long for him to \u201chear\u201d her. When he flung open the door, his face was dark with anger.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, I want to talk to you,\u201d she said.</p><p>He turned away from her. \u201cMy mother asks for you.\u201d</p><p>She stumbled after him, her legs weak from lack of use, her eyes not adjusted to the light in the hall. \u201cYou came because I called you,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a bond between us, and if you\u2019d let me explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>Halting, he glared at her. \u201cI wish to hear naught that you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me what you\u2019re so angry at me about? What have I done?\u201d</p><p>He looked her up and down in an insolent way. \u201cYou accuse me of treason. You frighten the villagers. You besmirch the name of the woman I am to marry. You bewitch my mother. You . . .\u201d His voice lowered. \u201cYou come into my head.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out, she put her hand on his arm. \u201cNicholas, I know I must seem strange to you, but if you\u2019d just listen to me and let me explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d he said, moving away from her touch. \u201cI have petitioned my brother to cast you out. The villagers will see to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee to me?\u201d she whispered, then shuddered as she remembered those filthy women in that little clump of houses. No doubt those rotten-toothed hags would stone her if given the chance. \u201cYou would do that to me? After the way I helped you when you came to me?\u201d Her voice was rising. \u201cAfter all I did for you when you came forward, you\u2019d throw me out? After the way I\u2019ve come back across four hundred years to save you, you\u2019d just throw me into the streets?\u201d</p><p>He glared at her. \u201cMy brother decides.\u201d Turning, he started down the stairs.</p><p>Dougless stayed close behind him and tried to control her anger enough to think. First, she had to figure out a way to keep from being tossed out of the relative safety of the house and into the muck of the streets. And Lady Margaret seemed to be the answer to that problem.</p><p>Lady Margaret was again in bed, and Dougless could see that the twelve-hour cold capsule had worn off.</p><p>\u201cYou will give me another of the magic tablets,\u201d she said, leaning back against the pillows.</p><p>In spite of being hungry, tired, filthy, and frightened, Dougless knew that now was the moment when she had to use her wits. \u201cLady Margaret, I am not a witch. I am merely a poor humble princess set upon by thieves, and I must appeal to you for help until my uncle the king can come to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess?\u201d Lady Margaret said.</p><p>\u201cKing?\u201d Nicholas half-shouted. \u201cMother, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lady Margaret put up her hand to silence him. \u201cWho is your uncle?\u201d</p><p>Dougless took a deep breath. \u201cHe is the king of Lanconia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have heard of this place,\u201d Lady Margaret said thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cShe is no princess,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cLook you at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis happens to be the style of dress in my country,\u201d she snapped at him. \u201cAre you going to throw me in the street and risk a king\u2019s wrath?\u201d She looked back at Lady Margaret. \u201cMy uncle would be very generous to anyone who protected me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dougless could see that Lady Margaret was considering this. \u201cI can be very useful,\u201d Dougless said quickly. \u201cI have lots of cold tablets, and I have all sorts of interesting things in my bag. And I . . .\u201d What could she do? \u201cI can tell stories. I know lots of stories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother, you cannot consider keeping her here,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cShe is no better than a flirt-gill.\u201d</p><p>Dougless guessed that that was a lady of ill repute. She turned angry eyes on him. \u201cLook who\u2019s talking. You and Arabella Sydney can\u2019t keep your hands off one another.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s face turned purple, and he took a step toward her.</p> <p>Lady Margaret coughed to cover laughter. \u201cNicholas, fetch Honoria to me. Go! Now!\u201d</p><p>With one more look of anger at Dougless, he obediently left the room.</p><p>Lady Margaret looked at Dougless. \u201cYou amuse me. You may remain in my care until a messenger can be sent to Lanconia to ask after your uncle.\u201d</p><p>Dougless swallowed. \u201cHow long will that take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month or more.\u201d Lady Margaret\u2019s eyes were shrewd. \u201cDo you recant your story?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, of course not. My uncle is king of Lanconia.\u201d Or will be, Dougless amended to herself.</p><p>\u201cNow the tablet,\u201d Lady Margaret said, leaning back on the pillows. \u201cThen you may go.\u201d</p><p>Dougless got a cold tablet from her bag but hesitated. \u201cWhere am I supposed to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son will tend to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour son locked me in a hideous little room, and there were bugs in the bed!\u201d</p><p>Judging from the look on Lady Margaret\u2019s face, she didn\u2019t seem to see anything wrong with what her son had done.</p> <p>\u201cI want a proper room and some clothes that won\u2019t make people stare at me, and I want to be treated with the respect due to . . . to my station in life. And I want a bath.\u201d</p><p>Lady Margaret looked at her with cold, dark eyes, and Dougless saw where Nicholas got his imperious manner. \u201cBeware you do not amuse me too much.\u201d</p><p>Dougless tried to keep her knees from knocking. Once, as a child, she\u2019d seen a wax museum that showed a medieval torture chamber. Now she remembered the instruments of torture too well. The rack. The Iron Maiden. \u201cI mean no disrespect, my lady,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI will earn my keep. I will do my best to continue to amuse you.\u201d Like Scheherazade, she thought. If I don\u2019t amuse this woman, tomorrow it\u2019s off with my head.</p><p>As Lady Margaret studied her, Dougless knew her fate, her very life, was being decided in this single moment. \u201cYou shall attend me. Honoria will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means I can stay? Oh, Lady Margaret, you won\u2019t regret this, I promise. I\u2019ll show you how to play poker. I\u2019ll tell you stories. I\u2019ll tell you all of Shakespeare\u2019s stories. No, I better not do that, it might upset things. I\u2019ll tell you about . . . ah, The Wizard of Oz and My Fair Lady. Maybe I can remember some of the words and music.\u201d Dougless, who had always refused to sing out loud, began to sing, \u201cI Could Have Danced All Night.\u201d Funny what the threat of being burned alive could make one do.</p><p>\u201cHonoria!\u201d Lady Margaret said sharply. \u201cTake her, clothe her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd food and a bath,\u201d Dougless added.</p><p>\u201cThe tablet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, sure.\u201d Dougless handed the cold tablet to Lady Margaret.</p><p>\u201cLet me rest now. Honoria will see to you. She will stay with you, Honoria.\u201d</p><p>Dougless hadn\u2019t heard the other woman enter. She looked to be the same woman who had been in the room last night, but Dougless couldn\u2019t see her face as she kept it turned away. Dougless followed Honoria from the room.</p><p>She felt better now knowing that she had some time before Lady Margaret found out she wasn\u2019t a princess. Was lying to a lady punished by death or merely torture? Or torture then death? But perhaps if Dougless could entertain Lady Margaret well enough, she wouldn\u2019t care whether she was a princess or not. And, too, perhaps a month was long enough to do what she must.</p><p>Clasping her travel bag tightly to her, Dougless followed Honoria to her room, which was next to Lady Margaret\u2019s. It was about half the size of Lady Margaret\u2019s room, but, still, it was large and very pretty. There was a white marble fireplace on one wall, a big four poster bed, some stools, two carved chairs, and a chest at the foot of the bed. Sun came in through a window that had small diamond-shaped panes of glass.</p><p>Looking about the pretty room, Dougless was beginning to relax somewhat. She had managed to keep herself from being thrown into the streets.</p><p>\u201cIs there a bathroom around here?\u201d she asked the back of Honoria.</p><p>Turning, the pretty woman gave Dougless a blank look.</p><p>\u201cA privy?\u201d Dougless explained.</p><p>Nodding in understanding, she pointed to a small door in the paneling. When Dougless opened the door, she saw a stone seat with a hole cut in it; the little room was the equivalent of an outhouse indoors. And it stunk to high heaven. Beside the seat was a stack of paper, thick, hard paper that had writing all over it. She held one piece of paper up. \u201cSo that\u2019s what happened to all the medieval documents,\u201d she murmured. Quickly, she used the privy and left it.</p><p>When she went back into the room, she watched as Honoria opened a chest, pulled clothes out, laid them on the bed, then left the room. When she was alone, Dougless walked about, exploring. This room had no silver or gold ornaments as Lady Margaret\u2019s had, but everywhere were embroidered fabrics. Dougless had seen a few examples of Elizabethan embroidery in museums, but they had been old and faded. Here the cushions were brilliant, undimmed by time or use, and the colors were wondrous!</p><p>She walked around the room touching everything, marveling at the brightness of all of it. New antiques, she thought as she scratched furiously at bites on her back.</p><p>After a while the door opened, and two men came in bearing a big, deep wooden tub. The men wore red, tight-fitting wool jackets, puffy shorts like those Nicholas wore, and black knitted hose. Both men had strong, muscular legs.</p><p>There are things to be said for the Elizabethan age, Dougless thought as she admired the men\u2019s legs.</p><p>Behind the men came four women bearing buckets of steaming hot water. They wore simple, long wool skirts, tight bodices, and little caps on their heads. Two of the women had smallpox scars on their faces.</p><p>When the tub was half full of steaming water, Dougless began to undress, and Honoria held out her hands to help, but then stepped back, her eyes wide, when she saw Dougless needed no help in undressing. In other circumstances, Dougless would have been modest, but not when she was as filthy as she was. When she was down to her bra and panties, and Honoria was staring at her in speechlessness, Dougless held out her hand. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Dougless Montgomery.\u201d</p><p>Honoria didn\u2019t seem to know what to do, so Dougless picked up her hand and clasped it. \u201cSo, we\u2019re to be roommates.\u201d</p><p>Honoria gave Dougless a puzzled look. \u201cLady Margaret has requested that you remain with me, yes.\u201d She had a soft, pleasant voice, and Dougless could see that she was quite young, maybe only twenty-one or two.</p><p>Dougless stripped off her undergarments and stepped into the tub while Honoria picked up the modern clothes, examining each carefully, unabashedly curious.</p><p>Dougless took the soap the servants had left beside the tub, but it felt like a harsh version of Lava and it lathered about as well as a stone. \u201cWould you hand me my bag, please?\u201d she asked Honoria. Looking quite hard at the nylon of the bag, Honoria set it on the floor by Dougless, then watched as she unzipped it. Dougless withdrew a cake of soap\u2014she was always saving the pretty, scented bars from hotels\u2014and began to wash herself.</p><p>Honoria was making no attempt to hide her curiosity as she watched Dougless wash.</p><p>\u201cWould you tell me about this place?\u201d Dougless asked. \u201cWho lives here? Tell me about Kit and Nicholas, and is he engaged to Lettice, and is John Wilfred here, and what about Arabella Sydney?\u201d</p><p>Honoria sat on a chair and tried to answer questions as she watched in awe as Dougless used the marvelous soap, then shampooed her hair.</p><p>As far as Dougless could tell from Honoria\u2019s words, she\u2019d been transported back in time early enough that only Nicholas\u2019s engagement had taken place. Nicholas had not yet made a fool of himself on the table with Arabella, and John Wilfred was insignificant enough that Honoria didn\u2019t know who he was. Honoria would give Dougless any facts she wanted, but would not give an opinion. And she absolutely refused to gossip.</p><p>After Dougless had bathed and washed her hair, Honoria handed her a coarse, rough towel of linen, and when she was damp-dry, and her hair combed, Honoria began to help her dress.</p><p>First went on a long nightgown-like garment, very plain, made of finely woven linen. \u201cWhat about underpants?\u201d Dougless asked.</p><p>Honoria looked blank.</p><p>\u201cKnickers. You know.\u201d Dougless picked up her own pink lacy briefs from the chest top where Honoria had put them, but Honoria still looked blank.</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing below,\u201d Honoria said.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness,\u201d Dougless said, wide-eyed. Who would have thought that underpants were a recent invention? \u201cWhen in Rome . . .\u201d she murmured, and tossed her briefs aside.</p><p>Dougless wasn\u2019t prepared for the next layer of clothing. Honoria held up a corset. Dougless\u2019s experience of corsets was seeing Gone With the Wind and Mammy pulling Scarlett\u2019s laces, but this corset was . . .</p><p>\u201cSteel?\u201d Dougless whispered, holding the thing up to look at it.</p><p>The corset was made of thin, flexible strips of steel, covered with fine silk, with steel hooks down one side, and since the corset wasn\u2019t new, rust was showing through the silk. When Honoria buckled her into it, Dougless thought she might faint. Her rib cage could not expand, her waist was about three inches smaller than it was naturally, and her br**sts were pressed flat.</p><p>Dougless steadied herself against the bedpost. \u201cAnd to think that I used to complain that panty hose were uncomfortable,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Over the corset went a voluminous, long-sleeved linen shirt, the ruffled collar and sleeves embroidered prettily with black silk thread.</p><p>Around her waist was tied a half slip of linen that had wire sewn inside it so that it stood out in a perfect bell shape. \u201cA farthingale,\u201d Honoria said when asked, giving Dougless an odd look for not knowing this simple fact.</p><p>\u201cThis is getting heavy. Is there more?\u201d Dougless asked.</p><p>Honoria next put a half slip of lightweight wool over the wired farthingale.</p><p>Over this petticoat went another one, this one of emerald green taffeta. Dougless began to cheer up. The taffeta rustled when she moved and the fabric was beautiful.</p><p>Honoria picked up a dress of rust-colored brocade with a huge abstract design of black flowers. The dress was not easy to get into. Over Dougless\u2019s shoulders was a crisscross network of silk cords, a pearl at every joint. The front of the bodice was fastened with hooks and eyes that looked strong enough to hold army tanks together. An embroidered band concealed the closure.</p><p>There were no sleeves on the dress, but Honoria attached them separately, pulling them up over the long sleeves of the linen shirt underneath. At the shoulder the sleeves were big and puffy; then they tapered to the small wrists. The sleeves weren\u2019t solid fabric but strips of hemmed emerald taffeta, fastened every few inches by a gold square set with a pearl.</p><p>Dougless touched the pearls while Honoria hurriedly and efficiently went around Dougless with a long hatpin type of instrument pulling bits of the white linen out the cuts in the sleeves.</p><p>By now it had taken Honoria an hour and a half to put these garments on Dougless and she wasn\u2019t finished yet.</p><p>Next came the jewels. A belt of gold links with rough-cut square emeralds went around Dougless\u2019s now-tiny waist. An enameled brooch with pearls around it was pinned in the middle of the bodice, and two gold link chains went off to either side, fastening under her arms. Honoria picked up a collar that was a limp ruffle of linen, put it around Dougless\u2019s neck and tied it in back. (Later, Dougless found out that in 1564, Nicholas\u2019s ruff had been stiff with yellow starch, but, now, a mere four years earlier, no one had heard of starch.) To conceal where the ruff joined the dress, Honoria slipped a third belt of square gold links about her neck.</p><p>\u201cYou may sit,\u201d Honoria said softly.</p><p>Dougless tried to walk, but she was wearing somewhere around forty to fifty pounds of clothing and the steel corset was preventing her from breathing.</p><p>Stiffly, her head up off the scratchy ruff, Dougless made her way to a stool and collapsed. She did not, however, slump. One does not slump when wearing a steel corset.</p><p>Dougless sat rigidly while Honoria combed Dougless\u2019s thick auburn hair, then pulled it back from her face and braided it. Then, using bone pins, she fastened the braids up. Over the braids, on the back of Dougless\u2019s head, she fastened a little cap that was like a hair net, but again, pearls were at each joint.</p><p>Honoria helped Dougless stand up. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, smiling, \u201cyou are most beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs pretty as Lettice?\u201d Dougless asked without thinking.</p><p>\u201cLady Lettice is most beautiful also,\u201d Honoria said, her eyes cast downward.</p><p>Dougless smiled. Tactful, very tactful.</p><p>Honoria had Dougless sit on the edge of the bed, then put out her leg, and Honoria slipped fine, hand-knit wool stockings up to Dougless\u2019s knees; then she tied them with pretty ribbon garters embroidered with bumblebees. She slipped cork-soled, soft leather shoes on Dougless\u2019s feet, then helped Dougless to again stand up.</p><p>Slowly, Dougless walked toward the window, then back. The clothes were ridiculous, of course. They were heavy, unwieldy, terrible for your lungs, and yet . . . She put her hands to her waist. She could practically encircle it with her hands. She was wearing pearls, gold, emeralds, satin, and brocade, and in spite of the fact that she could barely breathe and her shoulders were already aching from the weight, she\u2019d never felt so beautiful in her life.</p><p>When she twirled about, the skirts belled out from her prettily. She looked up at Honoria. \u201cWhose dress is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine own,\u201d Honoria said softly. \u201cWe are near the same size.\u201d</p><p>Dougless went to her and put her hands on her shoulders. \u201cThank you very much for lending it to me. It was very generous of you.\u201d She kissed Honoria on the cheek.</p><p>Confused and blushing, Honoria turned away. \u201cLady Margaret wishes you to play for her tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlay?\u201d Dougless was looking at the sleeves of her gown. Real gold, not fake. How she wished she had a full-length mirror! \u201cPlay what?\u201d Her head came up. \u201cYou mean like play an instrument? I can\u2019t play anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Honoria was obviously shocked. \u201cThey do not teach music in your country?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey teach it, but I didn\u2019t take any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does a woman learn in your country if not sewing and music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlgebra, literature, history, things like that. Can you play an instrument? Sing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost certainly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how about if I teach you some songs and you play and sing them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Lady Margaret\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll be the bandleader.\u201d</p><p>From the way Honoria smiled, Dougless guessed that she\u2019d like introducing new songs to the household. \u201cWe shall go to the orchard,\u201d she said.</p> <p>When Honoria left the room, Dougless took a few minutes to apply cosmetics very lightly\u2014she didn\u2019t want to look like a painted hussy, but it would not hurt her cause to look as appealing as she could.</p><p>Moments later, Honoria returned with a lute, and a man handed Dougless a basket that she saw contained bread and cheese and wine; then they were on their way outside.</p><p>Now that Dougless wasn\u2019t afraid that any minute she was going to be thrown into a dungeon, she looked about her. There were people everywhere. There were children running up and down stairs carrying things; men and women scurried hither and yon. Some people wore coarse linen or wool, some dressed in silks, some had jewels, some not; some people wore fur, some men wore shorts like Nicholas, and some men wore long gowns. Nearly all the people seemed young, and what surprised Dougless the most was that the people seemed to be as tall as twentieth-century people. She\u2019d always heard that people of the Elizabethan age were much smaller than modern people. But she found that, at five feet three inches, she was short in the twentieth century and short in the Elizabethan age as well. The people did seem to be a lot slimmer, though. From all the moving about they did, plus the poundage of their clothes, they probably couldn\u2019t put on weight.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Nicholas\u2019s room?\u201d Dougless asked, and moments later, Honoria pointed to a closed door.</p><p>Dougless had to watch her step as she descended the staircase in her long skirts, but the brocade in her hand made her feel elegant.</p><p>As they made their way toward the back of the house, Dougless had glimpses of lovely rooms with gorgeously dressed women bent over embroidery frames. Outside, she and Honoria stopped on a brick terrace that had a low wall around it and a stone balustrade on top, and she had her first look at an Elizabethan garden. Before her, down some steps, was a maze of low, deep green hedges. To her right was another walled garden of vegetables and herbs set in perfectly arranged squares. A pretty little octagonal building stood in the middle. To her left she could see another garden of fruit trees with an odd sort of hill in the middle. On top of the hill was a wooden rail.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cA mound,\u201d Honoria replied. \u201cCome, we will go to the orchard.\u201d</p><p>They walked briskly down brick stairs, then across a raised walk beside a rose-covered wall, where Honoria opened an oak door and they entered the orchard. Dougless found that although the gown she wore very much constricted her upper body, from the waist down she was free. The farthingale held the weight of the skirts off her legs, and not wearing any underpants gave her the oddest feeling of being naked.</p><p>The orchard was lovely, and it struck Dougless how perfectly in order it was. Everything was planted symmetrically, and all of it was perfectly clean. She could see at least four men and two children using wooden rakes to clean and to generally make the garden beautiful. Now she could see why Nicholas had been so upset by the garden at Bellwood. But to keep a garden like this took the services of many, many people.</p><p>Honoria walked along the gravel path on the edge of the orchard to a grape arbor. As far as Dougless could see, there wasn\u2019t a dead leaf or twig on the vines, and the unripe grapes hung down abundantly.</p><p>\u201cThis is very pretty,\u201d Dougless whispered. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve never seen a garden as pretty as this one.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Honoria sat on a bench in front of a pear tree that was perfectly espaliered against the wall and pulled her lute onto her lap. \u201cYou will teach me your songs now?\u201d</p><p>Sitting beside her, Dougless pulled aside the cloth inside the basket she carried. Inside was a big piece of bread, white bread, but not like modern white bread. It was heavier, and very fresh, but there were odd holes in the crust. It was delicious. The cheese was tangy and fresh. Inside a hard leather bottle was a sour-tasting wine. There was also a little silver goblet.</p> <p>\u201cDoes no one drink water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe water is bad,\u201d Honoria said, tuning her fat-bellied lute.</p><p>\u201cBad? You mean undrinkable?\u201d She thought of the little houses she\u2019d seen yesterday. If those people had access to the water, it was sure to be dirty. How odd, she\u2019d always thought that water pollution was a twentieth-century problem.</p><p>Dougless spent a lovely two hours with Honoria in the orchard, eating the cheese and bread, sipping the cool wine from a silver goblet, watching the jewels on her own dress and on Honoria\u2019s twinkling in the sunlight, and watching the gardeners go about their work. She didn\u2019t know many songs, but she\u2019d always loved Broadway musicals and had seen most of them on video, so when she began to think about it, she knew more than she thought. Besides \u201cI Could Have Danced All Night,\u201d she knew \u201cGet Me to the Church on Time\u201d from My Fair Lady. She made Honoria laugh at the title song from Hair. And she knew \u201cThey Call the Wind Maria\u201d from Paint Your Wagon. She also knew the theme song from Gilligan\u2019s Island, but she didn\u2019t sing that.</p><p>After the fifth song, Honoria put up her hand to halt. \u201cI must write these,\u201d she said, then went back to the house to get paper and pen.</p><p>Dougless was content to sit where she was, like a lazy cat in the sun. Unlike her usual life, she felt no urgency to be somewhere else or do something else.</p><p>On the far side of the orchard a little door opened and she saw Nicholas enter. Immediately, Dougless was alert and her heart began to race. Would he like her dress? Would he like her better now that she looked like the other women of his century?</p><p>She started to get up, but then she saw a pretty young woman she\u2019d never seen before enter behind him. Nicholas was holding her hand as the two of them went running down the path toward the grape arbor in the opposite corner of the garden. It wasn\u2019t difficult to see that they were lovers slipping away to somewhere private.</p><p>Dougless stood up, her fists clenched at her side. Damn him, she thought. This is just the sort of thing that had gained him such an awful reputation in the twentieth century. No wonder the history books had nothing good to say about him.</p><p>Dougless\u2019s first impulse was to run after them and tear the woman\u2019s hair out. Nicholas might not remember her, but that didn\u2019t change the fact that Dougless was the woman he loved. But, Dougless told herself, that was neither here nor there. She owed it to the future memory of Nicholas to put an end to this cavorting.</p><p>Feeling saintly, telling herself she was doing this for Nicholas\u2019s own good, she swiftly walked toward the arbor. She was aware that every gardener in the orchard had stopped work and was watching her.</p><p>In the secret shade of the arbor, Nicholas already had the woman\u2019s skirt up her bare thigh, his hand disappearing underneath. His jacket and shirt were open, the woman\u2019s hand was inside, and they were kissing each other with a great deal of enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cWell!\u201d Dougless said loudly, somehow controlling her urge to spring at the two of them. \u201cNicholas, I don\u2019t believe this is the behavior of a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>The woman pulled away first and looked at Dougless in surprise. She started to push Nicholas away, but he didn\u2019t seem able to stop kissing her.</p><p>\u201cNicholas!\u201d Dougless said sharply in her schoolteacher voice.</p><p>When Nicholas turned to look at her, she saw that his eyelids were lowered, and he had that sleepy look she\u2019d seen only when he\u2019d made love to her.</p><p>Dougless drew in her breath.</p><p>When he saw her, Nicholas\u2019s expression changed to anger, and he dropped the woman\u2019s skirt.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d better leave,\u201d Dougless, her body shaking with anger, said to the woman.</p><p>The woman, looking from Nicholas to Dougless as they glared at each other, hurried out of the arbor.</p><p>Nicholas looked Dougless up and down, and the anger on his face almost made her retreat, but she held her ground.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, we have to talk. I have to explain to you who I am and why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>When he stepped toward her, this time she did step back. \u201cYou have charmed my mother,\u201d he said in a low voice, \u201cbut you do not charm me. If you come between me and my actions again, I will take a batlet to you.\u201d</p><p>He shoved past her so hard that Dougless nearly fell against the wall, and she watched with a heavy heart as he strode angrily down the path and out through the door in the wall. How was she supposed to accomplish anything if he wouldn\u2019t listen to her? He wouldn\u2019t even spend ten minutes in her company. What was she supposed to do, lasso him? Right, she thought, tie him up and tell him she was from the future and she had come back through time to save his neck\u2014literally. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll believe me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Honoria returned with a wooden lap desk, big feathers that she expertly trimmed into pens, ink, and three sheets of paper. She plucked out the notes of the songs, and asked Dougless to write the music. Her opinion of Dougless\u2019s education was further lowered when she found out that Dougless could neither read nor write music.</p><p>\u201cWhat is a batlet?\u201d Dougless asked.</p><p>\u201cIt is used to beat the dust from the clothes,\u201d Honoria answered, writing the notes down.</p><p>\u201cDoes Nicholas . . . ah, fool around with all the women?\u201d</p><p>Honoria stopped playing and looked at Dougless. \u201cYou should not lose your heart to Sir Nicholas. A woman should give her heart only to God. People die, but God does not.\u201d</p><p>Dougless sighed. \u201cTrue, but while we\u2019re alive, people can make living worthwhile or not.\u201d Dougless started to say more, but she glanced up, and standing on the terrace of the house, she saw someone\u2019s head, and it looked like . . .</p><p>\u201cWho is that girl?\u201d Dougless asked, pointing.</p><p>\u201cShe is to marry Lord Christopher when she is of age. If she lives. She is a sickly child and not often out.\u201d</p><p>The girl, from this distance, looked just like Gloria, just as fat, just as petulant. Dougless remembered Lee saying that Nicholas\u2019s older brother was to marry a French heiress and that was why he\u2019d refused Lettice\u2019s offer of marriage.</p><p>\u201cSo, Nicholas is to marry Lettice, and Christopher is engaged to a child,\u201d Dougless said. \u201cTell me, if that girl were to die, would Kit consider marrying Lettice?\u201d</p><p>Honoria looked taken aback at Dougless\u2019s casual use of Christian names. \u201cLord Christopher is heir to an earldom, and he is related to the queen. Lady Lettice is not of his rank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Nicholas is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Nicholas is a younger son. He does not inherit the estates or the title. For him Lady Lettice is a good match. She also is related to the queen, but distantly. Her dowry, though, is not large.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if Lettice married Nicholas, then, say, Christopher died, Nicholas would be the earl, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Honoria said, and stopped writing notes. Looking up at the terrace, she saw the fat, spotty, sickly French heiress go back into the house. \u201cSir Nicholas would become the earl,\u201d she said thoughtfully.</p><p>TWENTY - THREE</p><p>By the time Dougless climbed into bed beside Honoria that night, she was exhausted. No wonder she\u2019d seen so few fat people and the women had such tiny waists. Between the steel corset and the constant activity, fat didn\u2019t have a chance to settle on a person\u2019s body.</p><p>She and Honoria had left the garden to attend a service in the pretty little chapel on the ground floor of the house. They\u2019d listened to a richly dressed minister and they\u2019d spent a great deal of time on their knees. Dougless couldn\u2019t pay attention to what the minister was saying for looking at the stunning clothes of the men and women around her: silk, satin, brocade, fur, jewels.</p><p>It was in the chapel that she had her first glimpse of Christopher. He looked like Nicholas, but not so young or handsome. But there was a quiet strength coming from him that made Dougless stare at him. When he glanced across at her, there was so much interest in his eyes that Dougless looked away, blushing. She didn\u2019t see Nicholas watching the two of them and frowning.</p><p>After chapel was supper, which Dougless took in the Presence Chamber with Lady Margaret, Honoria, and four other women. There was vegetable beef soup, a nasty bitter beer, and fried rabbit. A man, who Honoria said was the butler, had to chip cinders from the crust of a loaf of bread before he served it to them, and thereby explained the holes in the crust of Dougless\u2019s earlier loaf.</p><p>The other women, Dougless learned, were Lady Margaret\u2019s gentlewomen and chamberers. As far as Dougless could tell, everyone in the household had a specific rank, and servants had servants who had servants. And, to her surprise, they also had specific duty hours. Her knowledge of servants was based on what she\u2019d read of Victorian households, where the servants worked from very early to very late, but she learned from questioning Honoria, there were so many servants in the Stafford household that no one worked longer than about six hours at a time.</p><p>At supper, Dougless was introduced, and the ladies eagerly asked about her country of Lanconia and her uncle the king. Dougless, squirming with the lie, muttered replies, then asked the ladies about their clothes. She received some fascinating information on the Spanish style of dress, the French, the English, and the Italian fashions. Dougless became very involved in this, and soon found herself planning a gown in the Italian style that had something called a bum role under the skirt instead of a farthingale.</p><p>After supper, servants cleared the tables, then moved them against the wall, and Lady Margaret asked to hear Dougless\u2019s songs. What followed was an energetic and laugh-filled evening. With no TV and professional performances ever seen, no one was shy about singing or dancing. Dougless knew she was terrible compared to the people she\u2019d heard on the radio and on records, but before the evening was over she found herself singing solos.</p><p>Christopher came to join them, and Honoria taught him \u201cThey Call the Wind Maria,\u201d which he played on the lute. Everyone seemed to play an instrument, and before long Lady Margaret and all five of her ladies were playing the melodies on oddly-shaped, strange-sounding instruments. There was a guitar of sorts but shaped like a violin, a three-stringed violin, a tiny piano, an enormous lute, several kinds of flutes, and a couple of horns. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dougless found herself drawn to Kit. He was so much like Nicholas, the Nicholas she\u2019d known in the twentieth century\u2014certainly not this sixteenth-century Nicholas who went from one woman to another. She sang \u201cGet Me to the Church on Time,\u201d and Kit quickly picked up the melody. In no time they were all singing the funny song.</p><p>At one point she saw Nicholas standing in the doorway glowering. He refused to enter even when Lady Margaret motioned to him.</p><p>It was only about nine o\u2019clock when Lady Margaret said it was time to retire. Kit kissed Dougless\u2019s hand, and she smiled at him; then she followed Honoria off to bed.</p><p>Honoria\u2019s maid came to help the two women undress. Dougless took several lovely, deep breaths after the steel corset was removed; then, wearing the long linen undergarment she\u2019d worn under her dress all day and a little cap to protect her hair, she climbed into bed beside Honoria. The sheets were linen and scratchy and not too clean, but the mattress was of goose down and as soft as a whisper. She was asleep before she\u2019d pulled the coverlet over her.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d been asleep when she awoke. She felt as though someone was calling her, but when she lifted her head and listened, she heard no one, so she lay back down. But the feeling that someone wanted her would not go away. Although the room was silent, she couldn\u2019t get rid of the feeling that she was needed by someone.</p><p>\u201cNicholas!\u201d she said, coming bolt upright.</p><p>After a glance at the sleeping back of Honoria, Dougless crept out of bed. She put on a heavy brocade robe that was at the foot of the bed; then she slipped her feet into the soft, wide shoes. Elizabethan corsets might be murder but the shoes were heaven.</p><p>Silently, she left the room, then stood outside the closed door and listened. There was no sound, and what with the straw on the floor, she\u2019d have been able to hear any footsteps. She started walking to the right, for she felt the call strongest there. She went to one closed door, put her hand on it, but felt nothing. The same at the second door. It was at the third door that she could feel the call the strongest.</p><p>When she opened the door, she wasn\u2019t surprised to see Nicholas sitting on a chair wearing his tight hose, the baggy shorts, and a big linen shirt open to the waist. A fire burned in the fireplace, and he held a silver tankard. He looked as though he\u2019d been drinking for a while.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want of me?\u201d she asked. She was more than a little afraid of this Nicholas, as he didn\u2019t seem remotely like the man who had come to her own century.</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at her, just stared at the fire.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, I\u2019m willing to talk, but if you\u2019re just going to give me the silent treatment, then I\u2019d like to go back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cHow do I know of you?\u201d</p><p>She sat on the chair next to him, facing the fire. \u201cWe are bonded somehow. I can\u2019t explain it. I cried for help and you came to me. I needed you and you heard my call. You gave me . . .\u201d Love, she almost said. Somehow that seemed long ago and this man was a stranger to her. \u201cIt seems to be my turn now. I\u2019ve come to warn you.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cWarn me? Ah, yes, I must not commit treason.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to sound so cynical. If I can come all this way back here, the least you can do is listen. That is, if you can keep your hands from under some woman\u2019s skirt long enough.\u201d</p><p>She could see his face turning red with rage. \u201cCallet!\u201d he said under his breath. \u201cYou who use your witchcraft to befuddle my mother, who exhibit yourself to my brother, dare to speak ill of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a witch. I\u2019ve told you that a thousand times. All I\u2019ve done is what I\u2019ve had to do to get myself inside your house so I can warn you.\u201d Standing up, she tried to calm herself. \u201cNicholas, we have to stop arguing. I\u2019ve been sent back to warn you, but unless you listen to me, everything\u2019s going to happen the same way it did before. Kit will\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stood up, cutting her off, then leaned over her threateningly. \u201cWhen you came to me this night, did you come from my brother\u2019s bed?\u201d</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t think about what she did. She just slapped him across the face.</p><p>He grabbed her against him, his body forcing hers backward as he put his mouth on hers, hard, angry.</p><p>Dougless wasn\u2019t going to allow a man to use force to kiss her. She pushed at him with all her strength, but he didn\u2019t release her. One of his hands was on the back of her head, forcing her head sideways, while the other hand slipped to the small of her back and pushed her body intimately to his.</p><p>When his lips touched hers, Dougless stopped fighting him. This was Nicholas, the Nicholas she\u2019d come to love, the man that even time couldn\u2019t separate her from. Her arms went about his neck, and she opened her mouth under his. As she kissed him in return, her body began to melt into his. Her legs were weak, trembling.</p> <p>His lips moved to her neck.</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d she whispered, \u201cmy beloved Colin.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his face away from her, looking puzzled. She touched the hair at his temples, ran her fingertips down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI thought I had lost you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI thought I\u2019d never see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may see all of me that you wish,\u201d he said, smiling; then he put his hand under her knees and carried her to his bed. He stretched out beside her and Dougless closed her eyes as his hand went under her robe, then untied the neck of her gown. He kissed her ear, nibbling at her lobe, then ran his tongue down the sensitive cord of her neck while his hand slipped inside her gown to touch her breast.</p><p>As his thumb rubbed the peak of her breast, as his breath was on her ear, he whispered, \u201cWho has sent you to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d Dougless murmured. \u201cGod, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the name of the god you worship?\u201d</p><p>Dougless could barely hear him as he slipped one leg over hers. \u201cGod. Jehovah. Allah. Whoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat man worships this god?\u201d</p><p>Dougless was beginning to hear him. She opened her eyes. \u201cMan? God? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas squeezed her breast. \u201cWhat man has sent you to my house?\u201d</p><p>She was beginning to understand his motive in making love to her. She pushed away from him, and sitting up, she tied her gown and robe. \u201cI see,\u201d she said, trying to control her anger. \u201cThis is how you always get what you want from women, isn\u2019t it? At Thornwyck all you had to do was kiss my arm and I\u2019d agree to do whatever you wanted. So now you\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m up to no good, so you\u2019re going to seduce a confession out of me.\u201d</p><p>She got off the bed and stood glaring at him. But Nicholas lounged on the bed, not at all upset by the revelation of his devious actions. \u201cLet me tell you something, Nicholas Stafford, you\u2019re not the man I thought you were. The Nicholas I knew was a man who cared about honor and justice. All you care about is the number of women you can bed.\u201d</p><p>She stood up straighter. \u201cAll right, I\u2019m going to tell you who sent me and why I\u2019m here.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m from the future, the twentieth century actually, and you came to me there. We spent several lovely days together.\u201d</p><p>His mouth dropped open and he started to speak, but Dougless put up her hand. \u201cHear me out. When you came to me the time here was September of 1564, four years from now and you were sitting in a prison awaiting your execution for treason.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s eyes began to twinkle in amusement as he rolled off the bed and picked up his tankard. \u201cI see why my mother has taken you to amuse her. Tell me more. What treason had I committed?\u201d</p><p>Dougless clenched her fists at her side. It was difficult to be caring toward a man who was smirking in derision. \u201cYou hadn\u2019t. You were innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d he said patronizingly. \u201cI would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were gathering an army to protect your lands in Wales, but in your haste, you didn\u2019t petition the queen for permission to raise the army. Someone told her you were planning to use the army to take her throne.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas sat down and looked at her, his eyes filled with amazement. \u201cPray tell me, who lied to the queen about these lands I do not own and this army I do not possess?\u201d</p><p>She was so angry at his attitude that she wanted to leave the room. Why bother to try to save him? Let the history books record that he was a wastrel. He was a wastrel. \u201cThey were your lands and your army because Kit was dead, and Robert Sydney and your beloved Lettice had lied to the queen.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s face changed to cold rage. He advanced on her. \u201cDo you enter this household to threaten my brother\u2019s life? Do you think to cast your spells on me so that I feel all that you do in the hopes that I will take you to wife and make you a countess? Do you stop at nothing? You besmirch the name of my betrothed as well as my cater-cousin to gain your desires?\u201d</p><p>She backed away from him, afraid of him now. \u201cI can\u2019t marry you because my life doesn\u2019t belong in this century. I certainly can\u2019t go to bed with you because if I did I\u2019d probably disappear, and if I disappeared now, I\u2019m sure nothing would be changed. And besides that, I don\u2019t want to marry you. Okay, so I came back to give you a message and that\u2019s it. So now maybe I\u2019ll get lucky and disappear. I hope I do. Truthfully, I hope I never have to see you again.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the door handle, but he slammed the door shut and wouldn\u2019t let her leave.</p><p>\u201cI will watch you. If my brother has one pain, I will know it is caused by you and you will pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI left my voodoo doll on the plane. Now, will you let me out or do I scream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeed me, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand you perfectly, but since I\u2019m not a witch, I don\u2019t have any fears, do I? Now open the door and let me out of here.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, and Dougless, with her head high, left the room. She was all the way down the corridor to the room she shared with Honoria before she started crying. She thought she\u2019d lost Nicholas when he\u2019d returned to the sixteenth century, but that hadn\u2019t been as complete as this. Now he wasn\u2019t even the same man she\u2019d known and loved such a short time ago.</p><p>She didn\u2019t return to Honoria\u2019s bedroom, but went to the Presence Chamber to curl up on a window seat. The tiny diamond-shaped panes of glass were too thick and rippled to see out of, but Dougless didn\u2019t care about seeing out. How many times was she going to lose the man she loved? Was the Nicholas who came to her in the twentieth century the man who\u2019d just kissed her? Other than looks, the two seemed to have nothing in common.</p><p>Once again, Dougless, she told herself, you\u2019ve fallen for the wrong man. If he wasn\u2019t a man with one foot in jail, then he was a man who chased after every woman around. One minute Nicholas was cursing Dougless for being a witch, and the next he was kissing her.</p><p>When Nicholas had gone back before, he\u2019d been executed, because they\u2019d not had enough information. Afterward, she\u2019d felt that they might have found the information they needed if she hadn\u2019t spent so much time being jealous of Arabella. If Dougless had spent more time researching and asking questions, she might have saved Nicholas\u2019s life.</p><p>So now she\u2019d been given a second chance, yet she was repeating the same mistakes. She was letting emotion blind her to what must be done. This extraordinary, unbelievable thing of switching two people back and forth through time had been done to her and Nicholas so that lives and fortunes could be saved. But all Dougless could think of was whether Nicholas still loved her or not. She threw jealous fits like a junior-high-school-girl because a grown man was fooling around with some woman in a grape arbor.</p><p>Dougless stood up. She had a job to do and she had to do it without allowing petty emotion to get in her way.</p><p>She went back into Honoria\u2019s bedroom and slipped into bed beside her. Today she would start finding out what she could do to prevent the treachery of Lettice Culpin.</p><p>Dougless had merely closed her eyes when the bedroom door was flung open and Honoria\u2019s maid entered. She pulled back the hangings to the four-poster bed, opened the shutters to the windows, took Honoria\u2019s and Dougless\u2019s gowns and the layers of underwear from the chest at the foot of the bed, and shook them. Minutes later Dougless was caught up in the bustle of the day, of dressing again in Honoria\u2019s second-best gown and eating a breakfast of beef and beer and bread. Honoria started to clean her teeth with a linen cloth and some soap, but Dougless didn\u2019t want to try the flavor, so she gave Honoria one of the several hotel giveaway toothbrushes she had in her bag. After a demonstration of its use and some exclamations over the toothpaste, she and Honoria companionably brushed their teeth, spitting into a lovely hammered copper basin.</p><p>After breakfast in their chamber, Dougless followed Honoria into a bustle of activity as she attended Lady Margaret in directing the large household. There was a morning church service to attend, then the servants to see to. Dougless stood by and watched in awe as Lady Margaret went over every problem, talked and listened to every complaint.</p><p>Dougless asked Honoria a thousand questions as Lady Margaret competently and efficiently dealt with what seemed to be hundreds of servants: marshals of the hall, yeomen of the chamber, yeomen waiters. Honoria explained that these were only the household heads and that each of these men had many servants under him. She said that Lady Margaret was unusual in that she dealt personally with the household servants.</p><p>\u201cThere are more servants than these?\u201d Dougless asked.</p><p>\u201cMany more, but Sir Nicholas deals with them.\u201d</p><p>There is no mention in your history books that I was chamberlain to my brother? Dougless remembered Nicholas asking.</p><p>After an exhausting morning, at about eleven A.M., the servants were dismissed and Dougless followed Lady Margaret, Honoria, and the other ladies downstairs to what Honoria said was the winter parlor. Here a long table was beautifully laid with a snowy white linen cloth, and each place setting consisted of a large plate, a spoon, and a big napkin. In the center of the table, the plates were . . . Dougless could hardly believe her eyes: the plates were gold. The plates further down the table were silver, then came pewter plates, until a couple on the end were made of wood. There were chairs behind the gold plates and stools for the other diners. There was no disguising who was considered of higher rank than someone else. Obviously, equality was not something these people pursued.</p><p>Dougless was happy to see that Honoria led her to a silver plate, and Dougless was further pleased to find herself sitting across from Kit.</p><p>\u201cWhat amusement do you plan for us this eve\u2019n?\u201d he asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dougless looked into his deep blue eyes and thought, How about spin the bottle? \u201cAh . . .\u201d She had been so involved with the problem of Nicholas she had given her job little thought. \u201cWaltzing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the national dance of my country.\u201d</p><p>When he smiled at her, Dougless smiled back warmly.</p><p>Her concentration was broken when a servant brought a ewer and basin and towel for each guest to wash his hands. Dougless saw that, three seats down from Kit was Nicholas, and he was in serious conversation with a tall, dark-haired woman who wasn\u2019t beautiful exactly but very handsome. For a moment, Dougless stared at the woman, thinking that she\u2019d seen her before, but she couldn\u2019t place her.</p><p>Turning away, she looked at the other people and thought how odd it was to see women without makeup, but the women obviously took care of their skin. They didn\u2019t just get up, wash their faces, and go.</p> <p>On the other side of Nicholas was the French heiress who was to marry Kit. The girl sat quietly, her lower lip stuck out, a frown on her plain face. No one spoke to her, but she didn\u2019t seem to mind. Behind her hovered a fierce-looking older woman who, when the girl knocked her napkin askew, straightened it.</p><p>Dougless caught the girl\u2019s eye and smiled, but the girl glowered back, and the hovering woman looked as though Dougless had threatened her charge. Dougless turned away.</p><p>When the food arrived, Dougless saw that it was presented with great ceremony. And cooking like this deserved ceremony. The first course of meat was brought in on enormous silver trays: roast beef, veal, mutton, salted beef. Wine, which was kept cool in copper tubs of cold water, was poured into jewel-colored, translucent goblets of Venetian glass.</p><p>The next course was fowl: turkey, boiled capon, chicken stewed with leeks, partridge, pheasant, quail, woodcock. Next came fish: sole, turbot, whiting, lobster, crayfish, eels.</p><p>Everything seemed to be cooked in a sauce, all of it highly spiced and delicious.</p> <p>Vegetables came next: turnips, green peas, cucumbers, carrots, spinach. Dougless did not find the vegetables as good as the other courses because they had been cooked to a pulp. When she asked, she was told that vegetables must be cooked thoroughly to remove the poisons from them.</p><p>With every course a different wine was served, and servants rinsed the glasses before filling them with the next wine.</p><p>Salads came after the vegetables. Not salads as she knew them but cooked lettuce and even cooked violet buds.</p><p>When Dougless was so full she felt like lying down and sleeping the afternoon away, dessert was brought in. There were almond tarts and pies of nearly every fruit imaginable, and there were cheeses that ranged from creamy to hard. The fat, sun-warmed strawberries were more flavorful than any Dougless had ever tasted in the modern world.</p><p>For once Dougless was thankful for her steel corset, which kept her from gorging herself.</p><p>After the meal the ewer of water was brought around again because the food had been eaten with spoons and fingers.</p> <p>At last, after three hours, the group broke up and Dougless waddled up the stairs to Honoria\u2019s room and flopped on the bed. \u201cI am dying,\u201d she said woefully. \u201cI\u2019ll never be able to walk again. And to think I expected Nicholas to be happy with a club sandwich for lunch.\u201d</p><p>Honoria laughed at her. \u201cNow we must attend Lady Margaret.\u201d</p><p>Dougless soon found out that the Elizabethan people worked as hard as they ate. With her hand on her full belly, Dougless followed Honoria downstairs, through a beautiful knot garden, and out to the stables. Dougless was helped onto a horse with a sidesaddle, which she had a great deal of trouble holding on to; then Lady Margaret, her five women and four male guards wearing swords and daggers, set off at a mad pace. Dougless had a hard time keeping up because she was so unbalanced, with one leg hooked over a tall wooden pommel and the other in a short stirrup. Dougless knew her Colorado cousins wouldn\u2019t be very proud of her because she used both hands to hold on to the reins.</p><p>\u201cThey have no horses in Lanconia?\u201d one of the men asked her.</p><p>\u201cHorses, yes; sidesaddles, no,\u201d she answered as she held on fearfully.</p><p>After about an hour she began to feel less like she was going to fall off at any second, so she could look around her. Going from the beautiful Stafford house to the English countryside was like going from a fairy castle to a slum, or maybe from Beverley Hills to Calcutta.</p><p>Cleanliness was not part of the villagers\u2019 lives. Animals and people lived in the same buildings and on the same sanitary level. Kitchen and privy slops were thrown outside the doors of the dark little houses. The people were as dirty as only years\u2019 worth of dirt and sweat could make them. Their clothes were coarse and stiff with grease and use.</p><p>And diseases! Dougless stared at the people they passed. They were marked with smallpox; they had neck goiter, ringworm, running sores on their faces. Many times she saw crippled and maimed people. And no one over the age of ten seemed to have all his teeth\u2014and the ones they did have were usually black.</p> <p>Dougless\u2019s huge lunch threatened to come up. What made her feel worse than the sights and smells was the fact that most of the illnesses could be cured with modern medicine. As she rode, holding on to the saddle, she could see that there were very few people past the age of thirty, and it occurred to Dougless that had she been born in the sixteenth century, she wouldn\u2019t have lived past ten years old. At ten her appendix had ruptured and she\u2019d required emergency surgery. There was no surgery in the sixteenth century. But then she probably wouldn\u2019t even have survived birth because Dougless had been a breech birth and her mother had hemorrhaged. As she thought about this, she looked at these people with new eyes. These people were the survivors, the healthiest of the healthy.</p><p>As Lady Margaret\u2019s group rode by, the villagers came out of their huts or stopped working in the fields to stare at the procession of beautifully dressed people on their sleek horses. Lady Margaret and her attendants waved to the villagers, and the villagers grinned back. We\u2019re rock stars, movie stars, and royalty all rolled into one, Dougless thought, and she waved at the people too.</p><p>They rode for what seemed to be hours to Dougless\u2019s sore backside and cramped legs before they halted in a pretty little meadow that overlooked a field full of grazing sheep. One of the grooms helped Dougless from her horse, and she limped to where Honoria sat on a cloth on the damp ground.</p><p>\u201cYou have enjoyed the ride?\u201d Honoria asked.</p><p>\u201cAbout as much as measles and whooping cough,\u201d Dougless murmured. \u201cI take it Lady Margaret is over her flu?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is a most energetic woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>They sat in companionable silence for a while, Dougless looking at the pretty view and trying not to think of her encounter with Nicholas the night before. She asked Honoria what a callet was and found out it was a lewd woman. Dougless bit her tongue on renewed anger.</p><p>\u201cAnd a cater-cousin?\u201d she asked Honoria.</p><p>\u201cA friend of the heart.\u201d</p><p>Dougless sighed. So Nicholas and Robert Sydney were \u201cfriends of the heart.\u201d No wonder Nicholas would believe nothing bad about the man. Some friendship, she thought. Nicholas rolls about on the table with Robert\u2019s wife, and Robert plots to have his friend executed.</p><p>\u201cRobert Sydney is a pillicock,\u201d Dougless muttered.</p><p>Honoria looked shocked. \u201cYou know him? You care for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know him, and I certainly don\u2019t care for him.\u201d</p><p>Honoria looked so puzzled that Dougless asked what a pillicock was. \u201cIt is a term of endearment; it means a pretty rogue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEndearment? But\u2014\u201d She broke off. When Nicholas had asked her to return to the sixteenth century to cook for him and she\u2019d been so angry, she\u2019d called him rotten names and Nicholas had supplied \u201cpillicock\u201d to the list. He must have loved hearing an angry woman call him a term of endearment.</p><p>She smiled in memory. He could indeed be a pillicock.</p><p>One of the women, who was a maid to a maid to Lady Margaret, passed about little cookies made of crushed almonds.</p><p>Munching, Dougless asked, \u201cWho was the handsome dark-haired woman sitting next to Nicholas at dinner today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Arabella Sydney.\u201d</p><p>Dougless choked and coughed, sputtering crumbs. \u201cLady Arabella? Has she been here long? When did she come? When will she leave?\u201d The postcard, Dougless thought. That\u2019s where she\u2019d seen the woman: in the portrait on the postcard she\u2019d bought at Bellwood.</p><p>Honoria smiled. \u201cShe arrived yester eve and leaves early on the morrow. She journeys with her husband to France. They will not return for years, so she came to bid my Lady Margaret farewell.\u201d</p><p>Dougless\u2019s mind raced. If Nicholas hadn\u2019t had Arabella on the table yet and tomorrow Arabella left, then this had to be the day. She had to stop it!</p><p>Suddenly, she doubled over, her hands on her stomach, and began to groan.</p><p>\u201cWhat ails you?\u201d Honoria asked, concerned.</p><p>\u201cSomething I ate. I must return to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Honoria began.</p><p>\u201cI must.\u201d Dougless gave a few more groans.</p><p>Quickly, Honoria went to Lady Margaret and returned in a few minutes. \u201cWe have permission. I will accompany you with one groom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Let\u2019s just go fast.\u201d</p><p>Honoria looked confused as Dougless hurried toward the horses. As a groom helped her onto the saddle, Dougless didn\u2019t look at all ill.</p><p>Dougless would have thrown her leg over the idiot sidesaddle, but there was no stirrup on one side, so she tightened her leg around the big protrusion in the front, took a little riding crop, and applied it to the horse\u2019s flanks. Leaning forward, she hung on as the horse thundered down the rutted, dirty road.</p><p>Behind her came the groom and Honoria, doing their best to keep up with her.</p><p>Twice Dougless had to make the horse jump, once over a wagon tongue, once over a small wooden wheelbarrel. She reined in sharply as a child ran across the road and managed to miss him. She ran through a flock of geese that set up a terrible clatter.</p><p>When she reached the house, she leaped from the saddle, tripped on the heavy skirts, and fell face forward. But she didn\u2019t waste a moment as she got up and began running, flinging open the gate, then running down the brick walk and up the stairs, across the terrace and in through the front door.</p><p>Once she was inside the house, she stopped and stared up at the staircase. Where? Where was Nicholas? Arabella? The table?</p><p>To her left came voices, and when she heard Kit, she ran to him. \u201cDo you know where there\u2019s a table, about six feet long, three feet wide? The legs are turned in a spiral.\u201d</p><p>Kit smiled at the urgency in her voice\u2014and at the wild look of her. Her face was running with perspiration, her cap was half off, and her auburn hair was falling about her shoulders. \u201cWe have many such tables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one is special.\u201d She was trying to remain calm, but she couldn\u2019t quite do it. And she was trying to breathe, but the corset was constricting her lungs. \u201cIt\u2019s in a room Nicholas uses, and there\u2019s a closet in the room, a place big enough that two people can hide in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCloset?\u201d Kit said, puzzled, and Dougless realized that a closet in Elizabethan England wasn\u2019t a place to hang clothes.</p><p>An older man behind Kit whispered something to him, and Kit smiled. \u201cThe chamber next to Nicholas\u2019s bedchamber has such a table. He often\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t hear the rest. Tossing her skirt and petticoats over her arm, she ran up the stairs. Nicholas\u2019s bedroom was two rooms down on the right and next to it was a door. She tried the handle, but it was locked. She ran into his bedroom, and through it, but the connecting door was also locked.</p><p>She banged on the door with her open palms. \u201cNicholas! If you\u2019re in there, let me in. Nicholas! Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She could swear she heard sounds inside the room. \u201cNicholas!\u201d she screamed as she pounded and kicked the door. \u201cNicholas!\u201d</p><p>When he opened the door, he had a lethal-looking dagger in his hand. \u201cIs my mother well?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Dougless pushed past him. There, against the wall was the table she\u2019d seen in the Harewoods\u2019 library. It was four hundred years younger, but it was the same table. And sitting on a chair, trying to look innocent, was Lady Arabella.</p><p>\u201cI will have your\u2014\u201d Nicholas began.</p><p>But Dougless cut him off when she flung open a little door to the left of the window. There, huddled against the shelves, were two servants. \u201cThis is why I wanted you to open the door,\u201d she said to Nicholas. \u201cThese two spies would have seen everything you two were about to do.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas and Arabella were gaping at her, speechless.</p><p>Dougless looked at the two servants. \u201cIf one word of this gets out, we\u2019ll know who told. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>In spite of Dougless\u2019s odd speech pattern, they did indeed understand her. \u201cNow get out of here,\u201d she said.</p><p>As quickly as mice, they scurried from the room.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Nicholas began.</p><p>Ignoring him, Dougless turned to Arabella. \u201cI\u2019ve saved your life, because your husband would have heard of this and eventually he would have\u2014\u201d Dougless took a deep breath. \u201cI think you\u2019d better go.\u201d</p><p>Arabella, not used to being spoken to like this, started to protest, but then she thought of her husband\u2019s temper. She hurried from the room.</p><p>When Dougless turned to Nicholas, she saw the rage on his face\u2014which was nothing new, since he\u2019d hardly looked at her any other way since she\u2019d arrived. She gave him a hard glare, then started to leave.</p><p>She didn\u2019t make it out the door because Nicholas slammed it in her face.</p><p>\u201cDo you spy on me?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo you enjoy watching what I do with other women?\u201d</p><p>Count to ten, Dougless thought, or better yet, twenty. She drew a deep breath. \u201cI do not get my kicks from watching you make a fool of yourself with women,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cI\u2019ve told you why I\u2019m here. I knew you were about . . . about to have Arabella on the table because you\u2019d already done so. The servants told everybody, John Wilfred wrote the story, Arabella had your kid, and Robert Sydney did her in. Now, may I go?\u201d</p><p>She watched the emotions running across Nicholas\u2019s face, the anger, the confusion, and Dougless felt sympathy for him. \u201cI know that what I\u2019m saying is impossible to believe. When you came to me, I didn\u2019t believe you either, but, Nicholas, I\u2019m from the future and I\u2019ve been sent back in time to try to prevent the ruin of your entire family. Lettice\u2014\u201d</p><p>His look cut her off. \u201cDo you accuse an innocent woman? Or are you jealous of all women I touch?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dougless\u2019s vow to control her emotions flew out the window. \u201cYou vain peacock! I couldn\u2019t care less how many women you bed. It\u2019s nothing to me. You aren\u2019t the man I once knew. In fact you\u2019re half the man your brother is. I was sent back in time to right a wrong, and I\u2019m going to do the best I can, no matter how hard you try to thwart me. Maybe if I can prevent Kit\u2019s death, that will save the Stafford estates, then nobody will have to try to change you from being a randy satyr. Now, let me out of here.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas didn\u2019t move from in front of the door. \u201cYou speak of my brother\u2019s death. Do you mean to cast\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dougless threw up her hands and turned away. \u201cI am not a witch. Can\u2019t you understand that? I\u2019m a regular, ordinary person who\u2019s been caught in very strange circumstances.\u201d She turned back to him. \u201cI don\u2019t know all of what happened when Kit died. You said you were at sword practice and you cut your arm, so you couldn\u2019t go riding with him. He saw some girl in a lake and went after her. He drowned. That\u2019s all I know.\u201d Except that Lettice might have been responsible, Dougless thought, but she didn\u2019t add that.</p><p>He was staring at her, his eyes hostile.</p> <p>Her voice softened. \u201cWhen you came to me, I didn\u2019t believe you either,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou told me several things that weren\u2019t in the history books, but I still didn\u2019t believe you. Finally, you took me to Bellwood and showed me a secret door that held a little ivory box. No one, in all the years of the many different owners of the castle had found the door. You said Kit showed you the door the week before he died.\u201d She didn\u2019t like to think of Kit dying.</p><p>Nicholas gaped at her. She was a witch, for, just recently, Kit mentioned a hidden door at Bellwood, a door he had not yet shown his younger brother. What had she done to Kit to persuade him to tell her of this door that by right should be known only to family members?</p><p>In truth, what was she doing to his family and his household? Yesterday he\u2019d heard a stableman singing some absurdity of a song called \u201cZip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah.\u201d Three of his mother\u2019s women now applied paint to their eyelids that they said came from \u201cLady\u201d Dougless. His mother\u2014his sane, level-headed, wise mother\u2014took medicine from her hand with the trust of a child. And Kit watched the red-haired wench with the intensity of a bird of prey.</p><p>In the few days she had been in the Stafford house, she had upset everything. Her songs, her outrageous dances, the stories she told (lately the castle folk had been talking about some people named Scarlett and Rhett), even how she painted her face was affecting everyone. She was a sorceress, and she was gradually putting everyone under her spell.</p><p>Nicholas was the only person who made any attempt to resist her. When he tried to talk to Kit of the power the woman was gaining, Kit had laughed. \u201cOf what consequence are a few stories and songs?\u201d Kit had said.</p> <p>Nicholas didn\u2019t know what the woman wanted, but he did not mean to so easily fall under her spell as the others had. He meant to resist her no matter how difficult that might be.</p><p>Now, glaring at her, he knew that resisting her would never be easy. Her auburn hair was about her shoulders, and she held the little pearl cap in her hands. Never had he seen a woman as beautiful as she. Lettice, perhaps, was more perfect-featured, but this woman, this Dougless, who enraged him, had something more, something he could not name.</p><p>From the first moment he\u2019d seen her, it had been as though she had some secret hold over him. He liked being in control with women, like kissing them and feeling them melt against him. He liked the challenge of winning a difficult woman, and he liked the sense of power it gave him when he walked away from her.</p><p>But from the first this woman had been different. He watched her far more than she did him. He was aware of every time she looked at Kit, of every glance she gave some handsome servant, of every time she smiled or laughed. Last night in his room his awareness of her had been to the point of pain, and this awareness had made him so angry he could barely speak or think coherently. Her effect on him enraged him. After she left, he had not slept because he knew she wept. The tears of women had never bothered him before. Women always cried. They wept when you left them, when you would not do what they wanted, when you told them you did not love them. He liked women like Arabella and Lettice who never cried for any reason.</p><p>But last night this woman had spent the night weeping, and even though he could neither hear nor see her, he had felt her tears. Three times he had almost gone to her but he\u2019d managed to restrain himself. He had no intention of letting her know she had power over him.</p><p>As for her story of past and future, he did not so much as consider it. But something about her was strange. He did not for a moment believe she was a Lanconian princess\u2014nor did he think his mother believed her, but Lady Margaret liked the odd songs and the woman\u2019s strange manner of speaking. His mother liked the way this woman acted as though everything were new to her, from the food to the clothes to the servants.</p> <p>\u201c . . . you\u2019ll tell me, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stared at her; he had no idea what she\u2019d been saying. But suddenly a wave of such desire for her flooded his veins that he stepped back against the door. \u201cYou will not bewitch me as you have my family,\u201d he said as though he meant to convince himself.</p><p>Dougless saw the lust in his eyes, saw the way his lids lowered. In spite of herself, her heart began to pound. You touch him and you return, she told herself, but you can\u2019t leave until Kit is safe and Lettice\u2019s treachery is exposed.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, I don\u2019t mean to bewitch you, and I haven\u2019t done anything with your family that I haven\u2019t needed to do to survive.\u201d She put out her hand to touch him. \u201cIf you would only listen to me . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to your talk of past and future?\u201d he said with a sneer. He leaned his face close to hers. \u201cBeware of what you do, woman, for I watch you. When word comes that you have no uncle who is king, I myself will toss you from my home. Now get you from me, and do not spy on me again.\u201d Turning, he stormed from the room, leaving Dougless alone and feeling helpless.</p><p>She looked through his bedroom toward his retreating back. \u201cPlease, God,\u201d she prayed, \u201cshow me how I am to help Nicholas. Let me do what I failed to do the first time. Please show me the way.\u201d</p><p>Feeling older than she had when she entered, she left the room.</p><p>TWENTY - FOUR</p> <p>In the morning, Dougless saw Arabella just as she was stepping on a block to mount her beautiful black horse. Near her was a man who Dougless assumed was her husband, Robert Sydney. Dougless wanted to see him, wanted to see the face of the man whom Nicholas considered his friend, yet had sent his \u201cfriend\u201d to be executed.</p><p>Sydney turned, and Dougless drew in her breath. Robert Sydney looked very, very much like Dr. Robert Whitley, the man she had once hoped to marry.</p><p>Dougless turned away, her hands shaking. Coincidence, she told herself. Nothing more than coincidence. But later that day she remembered how, in the twentieth century, Nicholas, when he\u2019d first seen Robert, had looked as though he\u2019d seen a ghost. And Robert had looked at Nicholas with hatred in his eyes.</p><p>Coincidence, she told herself again. It could be nothing more.</p><p>During the next two days Dougless rarely saw Nicholas. When she did see him, he was glowering at her from a doorway or frowning at her across a table. Dougless was kept very busy by the household because they had come to regard her as TV, movies, carnival, and concert all in one. They wanted games, songs, stories; their demand to be entertained was insatiable. Dougless could not walk in the garden or in the house without someone stopping her and asking for one more bit of entertainment. She was kept busy for long hours trying to remember everything she\u2019d ever read or heard. With Honoria\u2019s help, she devised a crude version of Monopoly. They played Pictionary with slate tablets. When she ran out of fiction stories she\u2019d read, she started telling them history stories about America\u2014Lady Margaret especially loved these. Nathan Hale became a favorite hero of the household, and Lady Margaret kept Dougless up half of one night asking questions about Abraham Lincoln.</p><p>Dougless tried her best to stay in the entertainment field and not talk about religion or politics. After all, just a few years before Queen Mary had been burning people for being of the wrong religion. Twice Kit asked her questions about farming in her country, and, despite knowing little, she was able to make a few suggestions about compost and how it could be used with the crops.</p><p>Dougless knew that Lady Margaret\u2019s ladies were appalled at Dougless\u2019s poor education, at her speaking only one language and at her not being able to play a musical instrument. And they could not read her handwriting. But for the most part they forgave her.</p><p>While Dougless was teaching, she was also learning. These women did not have the pressure on them that twentieth-century American women did to be everything to everyone. The sixteenth-century woman was not supposed to be a corporate executive, an adoring mother, a gourmet cook and hostess, as well as a creative lover with the body of an athlete. If the woman was rich, she was to sew, look after her household and enjoy herself. Of course she didn\u2019t expect to live past about forty, but at least during her few years on earth, she wasn\u2019t under society\u2019s constant pressure to do more and be more.</p><p>As the days in sixteenth-century England accumulated, Dougless remembered her time of living with Robert. The alarm went off at six A.M., and she hit the floor running. She had to run to get a day\u2019s work done in a day. There were meals to prepare, groceries to buy, the house to be straightened (Robert had a cleaning woman once a week), and the kitchen to be cleaned again and again and again. And in her \u201cspare time\u201d she had a full time job. Sometimes she\u2019d wished she could stay in bed for three days and read murder mysteries, but there was always too much to do to consider being lazy.</p><p>Besides, there was the guilt. If she was resting, she felt she \u201cshould\u201d be at the gym trying to keep her thighs from spreading, or she \u201cshould\u201d be planning some scrumptious dinner party for Robert\u2019s colleagues. She felt guilty when, exhausted, she served a pizza from the freezer for dinner.</p><p>But now, here in the sixteenth century, the modern-day pressures seemed far away. People didn\u2019t live alone and isolated. This wasn\u2019t one house with one woman to do twenty jobs; this was one house with a hundred and forty-some people to do maybe seventy jobs. One tired, lonely woman didn\u2019t have to cook, clean, wash, and so on, plus hold an outside job. Here one person had one job.</p><p>Modern women had their own self-made guilt to make them miserable, but the sixteenth-century people had diseases, their fear of the unknown, their ignorance of medicine, and constant and ever-present death to haunt them. People in the sixteenth century died frequently, and death was always nearby for the Elizabethans. There had been four deaths in the household since Dougless had arrived, and all of them could have been avoided with decent emergency room care. One man died when a wagon fell on him. Internal bleeding. When Dougless saw the man, she would have given anything to have been a doctor and able to stop the bleeding. People died from pneumonia, flu, or a blister that became infected. Dougless passed out aspirin, dabbed wounds with Neosporin ointment, gave out spoonfuls of Pepto-Bismol. She might help people temporarily, but she could do nothing about decaying teeth, about torn ligaments that left people crippled for life, or about appendixes that burst and killed children.</p><p>Nor could she do anything about the poverty. Once she tried to talk to Honoria about the vast difference between the way the Stafford family lived and the way the villagers lived. It was then that Dougless learned about sumptuary laws. In America everyone pretended to be equal, saying that a man who was worth millions was no better than some guy who sweated for a living. But no one believed that. Rich criminals got off with light sentences; poor men got maximum sentences.</p><p>In the sixteenth century Dougless had found that the idea of equality was a concept that was met with laughter. People were not equal, and by law they were not even allowed to dress equally. In disbelief, Dougless had asked Honoria to explain these sumptuary laws. Earls could wear sable, but barons could wear only the arctic fox. If a man had an income of a hundred pounds a year or less, he could wear velvet in his doublet but not in his gown. If he made twenty pounds a year, he could wear only satin or damask doublets and silk gowns. A man making ten pounds or less a year could not wear cloth costing more than two shillings a yard. Servants could not wear a gown that reached below their calves, and apprentices constantly wore blue (which is why the upper classes rarely wore the color).</p><p>On and on the rules went. They covered income, furs, colors, cloth, cut. Dougless was allowed to wear whatever a countess did because she was one of Lady Margaret\u2019s ladies. Laughing at it all, Honoria said that everyone wore what he could afford, but if a person was found out, he had to pay a fine to the city coffers; then he returned to wearing whatever he wanted to.</p><p>In the twentieth century Dougless had never cared much about clothes. She liked them to be comfortable and long-wearing, but other than that she paid little attention to them. But these beautiful Elizabethan gowns were another matter! In the few days she\u2019d been in the sixteenth century, she\u2019d found the people to be obsessed with clothes. Lady Margaret\u2019s ladies spent hours planning gowns.</p><p>One day a merchant arrived from Italy, and he and his two cartloads of fabrics had been welcomed into the Presence Chamber as though he\u2019d discovered a cure for flea bites. Dougless had found herself joining in the frenzy of pulling out bolts of narrow fabrics and holding them up to herself and the other women.</p><p>Both Nicholas and Kit had joined them. Like most men, they loved being surrounded by laughing, excited, pretty women. To Dougless\u2019s embarrassment, but also her delight, Kit had chosen fabric for two gowns for her, saying that it was time she wore her own clothes.</p><p>That night in bed, Dougless had lain awake for a while and thought how different, yet how much alike these Elizabethans were from people of her own time. From reading novels set in Elizabethan times, Dougless had thought the people did nothing but discuss politics. Even with TV, radio, and weekly news magazines, the American people weren\u2019t half as well informed as the players in medieval novels seemed to be. But Dougless found these people, like ordinary Americans, much more concerned with clothes and gossip, and the smooth running of the enormous and complicated household, than in what the queen was doing.</p><p>In the end, Dougless decided to do what she could to help, but she didn\u2019t believe her job was to change sixteenth century life. She had been sent back through time to save Nicholas, and that was what she planned to concentrate on. She was an observer, not a missionary. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>However, there was one aspect of medieval life Dougless could not tolerate, and that was the lack of bathing. The people washed their faces and hands and feet, but a full bath was a rare occurrence. Honoria kept warning Dougless against her \u201cfrequent\u201d bathing (three baths a week), and Dougless hated that the servants had to haul the tub into the bedroom, then lug in buckets of hot water. The ordeal of preparing a bath was so enormous that after Dougless bathed, two more people would use the water. Once Dougless was the third bather and she saw lice floating on top of the water.</p><p>Bathing was close to becoming an obsession with her until Honoria showed her a fountain in the knot garden. The \u201cknots\u201d were hedges that had been planted into intricate designs, with bright flowers in the loops. In the center of the four knots was a tall stone fountain set in a little pool. When Honoria motioned to a child weeding the garden, he ran out of sight behind a wall; then, to Dougless\u2019s delight, water came from the top of the fountain and flowed down into the pool. The child had been sent to turn a wheel.</p><p>\u201cHow lovely,\u201d Dougless had said. \u201cJust like a waterfall, or a . . .\u201d Her eyes began to gleam. \u201cOr like a shower.\u201d It was at that moment that a plan began to form in her mind. Privately, she talked to the child who had turned the wheel and arranged to pay him a penny if he\u2019d meet her at four A.M. the next morning.</p><p>So, at four A.M. the next morning, Dougless tiptoed out of Honoria\u2019s room, down the stairs, and out to the knot garden. She carried her shampoo and rinse, a towel, and a washcloth. The child, sleepy-eyed but smiling, took the penny (which Honoria had given Dougless) and went to turn the wheel. Dougless hesitated for a moment about whether to remove all her clothes or not, but it was still quite dark and it would be a while before the rest of the household woke. So, she slipped off her borrowed robe and the long linen shirt and stepped, naked, under the fountain.</p> <p>Never has anyone in history enjoyed a shower more! Dougless felt as though years of dirt and oil and sweat were washing off of her. She\u2019d never been able to feel clean using a bathtub, and after weeks of not showering, she felt grimy. She shampooed her hair three times, then conditioned it, shaved her legs and underarms, then rinsed. Heaven. Sheer, perfect heaven.</p><p>At long last she stepped out of the fountain, gave a whistle to the boy to stop turning the wheel, then dried and put on her robe.</p><p>She was smiling broadly as she started back down the path toward the house. Perhaps she was grinning too broadly to be able to see properly, or maybe it was still too dark yet to see well, because she ran into someone.</p><p>\u201cGloria!\u201d she said before she realized it was the French heiress. \u201cI mean,\u201d she said, stumbling, \u201cI guess you\u2019re not Gloria, are you? Where\u2019s the lioness?\u201d Dougless gasped at what she\u2019d said. She\u2019d rarely seen this girl, but when she had, she\u2019d always been accompanied by her tall, overbearing guardian of a nurse. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d Dougless began, apologizing.</p><p>The heiress didn\u2019t reply but sailed past Dougless with her nose in the air. \u201cI am of an age to care for myself. I need no nurse.\u201d</p> <p>Dougless smiled at the girl\u2019s plump back. She sounded just like Dougless\u2019s fifth graders. They, too, thought they were old enough to take care of themselves. \u201cSneaked out, did you?\u201d Dougless said, smiling.</p><p>The girl turned quickly and glared at Dougless, then her face softened. \u201cShe does snore,\u201d she said with a bit of a smile; then she looked back at the fountain. \u201cWhat do you here?\u201d</p><p>When Dougless looked at the fountain, to her horror, she saw that the little pool was full of soap bubbles. To Dougless, the bubbles were pollution, but the heiress seemed to think they were wonderful. The girl lifted a handful of suds.</p><p>\u201cI took a bath,\u201d Dougless said. \u201cWant one?\u201d</p><p>The girl gave a delicate shudder. \u201cNay, my health is most delicate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathing won\u2019t hurt\u2014\u201d Dougless began but stopped. No missionary work, remember? she reminded herself. Moving to stand by the girl, Dougless looked at her closely in the early light. \u201cWho told you you were delicate?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLady Hallet.\u201d She looked at Dougless. \u201cMy lioness.\u201d There were tiny dimples in her cheeks.</p><p>Dougless considered what she was about to say, and she knew she was taking a chance, but the child looked as though she needed a friend. \u201cLady Hallet says you\u2019re delicate so she gets to tell you what to eat, and where you can and cannot go, and who may be your friend and who not. In fact, she gets to keep you under her thumb so much that you have to sneak out before daylight just to see the gardens. Is that about right?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, the girl\u2019s mouth dropped open, but then she stiffened and gave Dougless a haughty look. \u201cLady Hallet guards me from the lower classes.\u201d She looked Dougless up and down.</p><p>\u201cSuch as me?\u201d Dougless asked, suppressing a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou are not a princess. Lady Hallet says a princess would not make a spectacle of herself as you do. She says you are not educated. You do not even speak French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Lady Hallet says. But what do you think of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are not a princess or you would not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Dougless cut her off. \u201cNot what Lady Hallet says, what do you think?\u201d</p> <p>The girl gaped at Dougless, obviously not knowing what to say.</p><p>Dougless smiled at her. \u201cDo you like Kit?\u201d</p><p>The girl looked down at her hands, and Dougless thought her face turned red. \u201cAs bad as that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does not notice me,\u201d the girl whispered, tears in her voice. When her head came up and she glared in hate at Dougless, at that moment she looked so much like Gloria that it was eerie. \u201cHe looks at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Dougless gasped. \u201cKit isn\u2019t interested in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the men like you. Lady Hallet says you are close to being a . . . a . . .\u201d</p><p>Dougless grimaced. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me. I\u2019ve already been called that. Look . . . What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Allegra Lucinda Nicolletta de Couret,\u201d she said proudly.</p><p>\u201cBut what do your friends call you?\u201d</p><p>The girl looked puzzled for a moment, then smiled. \u201cMy first nurse called me Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucy,\u201d Dougless said, smiling, but then she looked at the lightening sky. \u201cI guess we better get back. People will be searching for . . . us.\u201d</p><p>Lucy looked startled, then gathered her heavy, expensive skirt and started to run. She was obviously terrified of being found missing.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow morning,\u201d Dougless called after her. \u201cSame time.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure Lucy heard or not.</p><p>Dougless went back to the house, ignoring the servants\u2019 looks at her wet hair and her robe. When she opened the door to Honoria\u2019s bedroom, she sighed. Now began the long, painful process of dressing, and she wished just now for the ease and comfort of jeans and a sweatshirt.</p><p>After breakfast she sneaked away from the other women to look for Nicholas. The women were demanding new songs, and already Dougless\u2019s small store was depleted. She was down to humming tunes and persuading the women to make up their own words. But today she had to talk to Nicholas. Nothing was going to be changed about his execution if she didn\u2019t talk to him.</p><p>She found him in a room that could only be an office, sitting at a table surrounded by papers. He appeared to be adding a column of figures.</p><p>He looked up at her, raised one eyebrow, then looked back down at his paper.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, you can\u2019t ignore me. We must talk. Sometime you\u2019re going to have to listen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am occupied. Do not plague me with your nonsensical chatter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChatter! Nonsense!\u201d she said in anger. \u201cWhat I need to say means more than that.\u201d</p><p>He gave her another look to be quiet, then returned to his column of numbers.</p><p>Dougless glanced at the paper, but the numbers made no sense to her. Some were Roman numerals, some written with a j instead of an i, and some numbers were Arabic. No wonder he had a difficult time adding them, she thought. Opening the little embroidered pouch that hung at her waist, she took out her solar calculator. She carried it with her because Honoria and the other ladies were always counting stitches in their embroidery, so Dougless often added and subtracted for them so their patterns would be accurate. But she had more important things to do than help him add, she thought as she set the calculator down beside Nicholas\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou and Kit were gone for a few days. Did you go to Bellwood? Did he show you the secret door?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cLord Kit,\u201d he said emphatically, \u201cis not your concern. Nor am I. Nor, for that matter, is my mother\u2019s household. Madam, you are not wanted here.\u201d</p><p>She was standing over him, looking down at him and trying to think of what to say to make him listen to her. Then, as she watched, in his anger Nicholas snatched up the calculator and began punching the buttons. He punched in the numbers, hit the plus key between them, then the equal at the end. Still speaking, obviously not even noticing what he\u2019d done, he wrote down the total on his piece of paper.</p><p>\u201cAnd furthermore\u2014\u201d he said as he started to add the second column.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d she whispered, \u201cyou remember.\u201d She drew in her breath; then louder, she said, \u201cYou remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember naught,\u201d he said angrily, but even as he spoke, he stared down at the calculator in his hands. He realized he\u2019d been using it, but now the knowledge of what it was and how it was used fled him. He dropped the thing as though it were evil.</p><p>Seeing him use the calculator was a revelation to Dougless. Somehow, what he\u2019d experienced in the twentieth century was buried in his memory. It was four years before it happened, but now also happened to be four hundred years before Dougless\u2019s birth. So many strange experiences were happening to her that she couldn\u2019t question his knowledge of a calculator. But if he remembered that little machine, then he remembered her.</p><p>She went to her knees beside him and put her hands on his arm. \u201cNicholas, you do remember.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas wanted to pull away from her, but he couldn\u2019t. What was it about the woman? he asked himself. She was pretty, yes, but he\u2019d seen women more beautiful. He\u2019d certainly been around women more pleasing than she was. But this woman . . . this woman never left his mind.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, \u201cdon\u2019t close your mind to me. Don\u2019t fight me. You might remember more if you\u2019d allow yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember naught,\u201d he said firmly, looking down into her eyes. He\u2019d like to take her hair out of the little cap, out of its braid.</p><p>\u201cYou do remember. How else would you know how to use the calculator?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not\u2014\u201d he began, then glanced at the thing sitting on top of the papers. But he knew that, somehow, he had known how to use it; he\u2019d known how to add the numbers with it. He jerked his arm from under her hands. \u201cLeave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas, please listen to me,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cYou must tell me if Kit has shown you the door at Bellwood or not. That information will give us an idea of how long we have until he\u2019s . . . he\u2019s drowned.\u201d Until Lettice orders him killed, she thought. \u201cIt may be weeks yet or even months, but if he\u2019s shown you the door, his . . . accident is a matter of days from now. Please, Nicholas, don\u2019t fight me on this.\u201d</p><p>He was not going to allow her to control him. He was not going to be like the rest of the household and follow her about begging for her favors. Any day now he expected her to ask for a purse of gold in exchange for another song. And his mother was so enamored of her that she\u2019d no doubt give the gold. As it was, Lady Margaret showered this woman with dresses and fans, and dug into the Stafford jewel chests to lend her all sorts of riches.</p><p>\u201cI know of no door,\u201d Nicholas said, lying. It had been but days since Kit had shown him the door at Bellwood. That this witch-woman knew of it was further proof that she was not what she seemed.</p><p>Dougless sat back on her heels, her green satin skirt billowing about her, and sighed in relief. \u201cGood,\u201d she whispered. \u201cGood.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to think that Kit was close to death. If Kit didn\u2019t die, then perhaps Lettice wouldn\u2019t have a chance to get her hooks into Nicholas, and the great injustice would be prevented. And, besides, perhaps after Kit was saved, she would be sent back to the twentieth century.</p><p>\u201cYou care for my brother?\u201d Nicholas asked, looking down at her.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cHe seems like a nice guy, but he\u2019ll never be . . .\u201d She trailed off. The love of my life, she\u2019d almost said. Looking into Nicholas\u2019s blue eyes, she remembered the night they\u2019d made love. She remembered his laughter and his interest in the modern world. Without thinking, she reached her hand out toward him. He didn\u2019t seem to think either as he took her hand and raised her fingertips to his lips.</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d came a voice from the doorway. \u201cMy pardon.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas dropped her hand, and Dougless, knowing the moment was lost, rose and smoothed her skirts. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me about the door, won\u2019t you? We\u2019ll have to keep watch over Kit,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>Nicholas didn\u2019t look at her. All the woman spoke of was his brother. She haunted his mind, yet she seemed to feel no such pull toward him. Her thoughts were of Kit alone. \u201cGo,\u201d he murmured, then louder, \u201cGo and sing your songs to the others. It will take more than a song to enchant me. And take that.\u201d He looked at the calculator as though it were something from the devil.</p><p>\u201cYou can keep it and use it if you want.\u201d</p><p>He turned hard eyes toward her. \u201cI know not how.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Dougless took the calculator, then left the room. So far, every attempt she\u2019d made to talk to Nicholas had failed. But at least now she was beginning to understand that he thought he was protecting his family from her. She couldn\u2019t help smiling at that thought. The Nicholas she\u2019d loved so much had also put his family first. In the twentieth century, he\u2019d wanted to return to a possible execution in order to save his family\u2019s honor.</p><p>This man was the Nicholas she\u2019d come to love, she thought, smiling. On the surface, what with the women on the table and in the arbor, he had seemed like the rake the history books had portrayed him to be. And of course she\u2019d hated his anger and animosity toward her. And it didn\u2019t help any that the rest of his family couldn\u2019t be nicer to her, with only Nicholas being hostile. But, under it all, she knew that he was the man she\u2019d come to love, the man who put others before himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>This thought made her forgive him for his hostility. What if she\u2019d had an ulterior motive for wanting to be near his family? It wasn\u2019t good to be as trusting as the family was. Nicholas was the one who was right. He should mistrust her. Since he consciously remembered nothing of her from before, he had no reason to trust her. And what with the bond between them and the way he \u201cheard\u201d her calling him at times, he had every reason to believe her to be a witch.</p><p>But he did remember, she thought. He said he remembered nothing, but he\u2019d remembered the calculator enough to use it correctly. She wondered if there were other things he remembered and she began to think of the contents of her tote bag. What else could she show him that might further jog his memory?</p><p>In the Presence Chamber everyone was in a flurry. It seemed that the caterer\u2019s goods had arrived. Dougless learned that this was a man who traveled all over England to buy special foods for the Stafford family, then sent them back once a month. This month he\u2019d sent back pineapples and cocoa powder that had been imported from Mexico to Spain, then into England. There was also sugar from Brazil.</p><p>Standing back and watching as the women exclaimed over these delicacies, Dougless couldn\u2019t help but think how the twentieth century took food for granted. Americans could have any food at any time of the year.</p> <p>As Dougless looked at the chocolate powder, carefully wrapped in cloth, she thought of the American picnic she\u2019d cooked for Nicholas: fried chicken, potato salad, deviled eggs, and chocolate brownies.</p><p>Suddenly an idea hit her. She\u2019d heard that smells and flavors were some of the strongest memory generators. She knew that certain foods reminded her of her grandmother, Amanda, for there was always an astonishing variety of food in her grandmother\u2019s house. And the smell of jasmine always reminded Dougless of her mother. If Nicholas was served the same meal he\u2019d eaten in the twentieth century, would it help him remember more of the time he\u2019d spent with her?</p><p>Dougless went to Lady Margaret and asked permission to be allowed to prepare the evening meal. Lady Margaret was pleased with the idea, but horrified that Dougless wanted to work in the kitchen herself. She proposed that Dougless tell the Groom of the Pantry what she wanted and that she talk to the Groom of the Kitchen (the one \u201cfor the mouth\u201d) and not go to the kitchen herself.</p><p>Dougless did her best to insist; besides, Lady Margaret had piqued her curiosity about the kitchen. And what in the world was a Groom of the Kitchen \u201cfor the mouth\u201d?</p><p>After the long, sumptuous dinner, Dougless went downstairs to the kitchen and was awed at what she saw: room after room with enormous fireplaces, huge tables, and many, many people scurrying about. But she soon discovered that each person had a job. There were two slaughtermen, two bakers, two brewers, a maltmaker, a couple of hop men, laundresses, children to do odd jobs, and even a man called a roughcaster whose job it was to patch the plaster when it fell down. There were also clerks to record every penny of expense. And all of these people had helpers.</p> <p>Huge carcasses of beef and pork were delivered into the kitchen in wagons, then passed through to the slaughtering room. Storage rooms, bigger than houses, were filled with barrels. Sausages as big as an arm and several feet long hung from the tall ceilings. In two rooms, set back in the wall high above the double fireplaces, were tiers of beds with straw mattresses where many of the kitchen workers slept.</p><p>The head groom took her through the rooms, and after Dougless was able to close her mouth in awe at the size of the place and at the vast quantity of food prepared in the kitchen room, she began to tell the man what she wanted to do.</p><p>Swallowing, she saw crates of chickens brought in; then a large woman began wringing necks. Cauldrons of water were put on to boil to scald the chickens so their feathers could be plucked, and she was told that the softest of these chicken feathers were saved to be used for pillows for the servants.</p><p>She was surprised that potatoes were found in a sixteenth-century household but not eaten often. But under Dougless\u2019s directions, women were soon set to peeling potatoes, and others to boiling eggs that were much smaller than twentieth-century eggs.</p><p>To get the flour for the batter for the chicken and for the brownies, Dougless was taken to the bolting room. Here flour was repeatedly sifted through fabric sieves, each one of increasing fineness. Dougless began to understand why pure white bread, called manchet, was so prized. The lower the status of the person in the household, the coarser his bread. Bread that had been bolted only once still had lots of bran\u2014and sand and dirt\u2014in it. Only the family and their immediate retainers got bread that had been bolted until it was perfectly clean.</p><p>Dougless knew there would be enough chicken, eggs, and potatoes for the whole household, but the brownies with the precious, expensive chocolate would be for the family only. One of the cooks helped her decide how much chicken got coated with rough flour and how much got flour from the next bolting, how much from the next, and so on. Dougless wasn\u2019t about to give a lecture on equality, especially since she knew the finest flour had no bran in it and many of the vitamins were missing, and therefore was not as nutritious as the flour that had been bolted fewer times. Dougless just concentrated on preparing a meal that could feed an army.</p> <p>The meal, which had been so easy when prepared in a modern English kitchen and done on a small scale, was not easy in the sixteenth century. Everything had to be made in vats and from scratch. There was no mustard or mayonnaise from the grocery for the eggs and potatoes. All the pepper, kept under lock and key, was whole and someone had to pick out the stones; then the peppercorns had to be crushed in a mortar the size of a bathtub. The nuts for the brownies didn\u2019t come in a plastic bag but had to be shelled.</p><p>As Dougless supervised, she watched and learned. Her only moment of panic came when she saw that the cake pans were lined with paper that had been written on. She watched in horror when she saw chocolate batter being poured over a deed that she was sure had been signed by Henry the Seventh.</p><p>By the time the meal was nearly ready to be served, Dougless knew that the meal had to be a picnic. As though she\u2019d always ruled an army, she sent men into the orchard to spread cloths on the ground, then had pillows brought down from upstairs.</p><p>Supper was late that evening, not served until six P.M., but from the looks on people\u2019s faces as they began to taste everything, they thought the wait was worth it. They ate their potato salad with spoons and devoured platefuls of deviled eggs. They loved the high seasoning of the chicken.</p><p>Dougless sat across from Nicholas and watched him so closely she hardly ate. But as far as she could see, nothing sparked a memory.</p><p>At the end of the meal, the servants triumphantly carried out silver platters heaped high with nut-filled chewy brownies. At the first bite there were tears of gratitude in the eyes of some of the diners.</p><p>But Dougless looked only at Nicholas. He bit; he chewed. Then slowly, he looked at Dougless, and her heart leaped to her throat. He does remember, she thought. He remembers something.</p><p>Nicholas put down the brownie; then, not knowing why he did it, he removed the ring from his left hand and handed it to her.</p> <p>Dougless put out a shaking hand and took the ring. It was an emerald ring, the same ring he\u2019d given her on that day at Arabella\u2019s house when she\u2019d first made brownies for him. She could see by his expression that he was puzzled by his action.</p><p>\u201cYou gave me this ring before,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWhen I cooked this meal for you the first time, you gave me this same ring.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas could only stare at her. He started to ask her to explain, but Kit\u2019s laughter broke the spell of the moment.</p><p>\u201cI do not blame you.\u201d Kit laughed. \u201cThese cakes are worth gold. Here,\u201d he said as he pulled off a simple gold ring and gave it to Dougless.</p><p>Smiling and frowning at the same time, she took the ring Kit offered. The ring was worth nothing compared to Nicholas\u2019s emerald, but had the values been reversed, Nicholas\u2019s ring would have been worth much more to Dougless. \u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured, then looked back at Nicholas. But he was looking away now and she knew that what he had remembered was gone.</p><p>TWENTY - FIVE</p><p>You are too silent, brother,\u201d Kit said, smiling at Nicholas. \u201cYou should come and make merry. Dougless is to teach us a card game called poker this night.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas looked away from his brother. Something had happened tonight, he thought, something he couldn\u2019t understand. At supper he had bitten into one of the chocolate cakes the woman had prepared and he\u2019d known, quite suddenly, without words, that she was not his enemy.</p><p>Even as he handed her his ring, he told himself he was being a fool. Often, when it came to this woman, he was sure he was the one sane person in his household. He was the only person who did not believe her to be a gift from God. And if her good works did turn out to be treachery, he would be the only one who was able to see her as she truly was.</p><p>But this evening, as he\u2019d eaten that wonderful cake, images had flashed across his mind. He saw her with her hair loose, her legs bare, and sitting on an odd two-wheeled metal frame of sorts. He saw her with water pouring down over her beautiful, nude body. And he saw her clutching his emerald ring to her breast and looking at him with love. Without a thought, he had slipped the ring from his finger and given it to her, because, somehow, the ring seemed to belong to her.</p><p>\u201cNicholas?\u201d Kit was saying. \u201cAre you well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nicholas said absently. \u201cI am well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you join us in this new game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d Nicholas murmured. He didn\u2019t want to be near the woman, didn\u2019t want her to cause him to see images of something he knew had not happened. It was better for him to stay away from her. If he spent time with her, perhaps he would begin to listen to her, even begin to believe her absurd stories of past and future.</p><p>\u201cNay, I do not go,\u201d he said to Kit. \u201cI work this night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork?\u201d Kit asked, his voice teasing. \u201cNo women? When I think on it, have you had a woman to your bed since Lady Dougless arrived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is no\u2014\u201d Nicholas began. He suddenly had another image of her smiling down at him, of her hair soft and full about her shoulders.</p><p>Kit laughed knowingly. \u201cIt goes that way, does it? I cannot blame you; the woman is beautiful. Do you mean to make her your mistress after your marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay!\u201d Nicholas said forcibly. \u201cThe woman is naught to me. Take her away with you. I wish never to see her again, never to hear her voice. I wish she had never come into my life.\u201d</p><p>Kit stepped back, still smiling. \u201cSo the thunderbolt has hit,\u201d he said, obviously enjoying Nicholas\u2019s agony.</p><p>Nicholas came out of his chair, ready to do battle over his brother\u2019s smirking, knowing tone. But Kit backed toward the door, and when Nicholas came close, Kit left the room, laughing loudly as he shut the door in his brother\u2019s face.</p><p>Nicholas sat down at the table again and tried to give his attention to the accounts before him, but all he could think of was the red-haired woman. He knew that she was laughing now, amused at what she was doing. He knew that, somehow, he\u2019d feel it if she wasn\u2019t happy.</p><p>He walked toward the window, turned its latch, opened it, then looked down into the garden. Unwanted, an image came to him. In his mind\u2019s eye, he saw another garden. It was night, and it was raining, and the woman was calling to him. He saw lights, strange, purple-blue lights on poles, and he saw himself in the rain, clean-shaven and wearing strange clothes.</p><p>Pulling away from the window, Nicholas slammed it shut, then rubbed his hands over his eyes as though to clear the vision. He would not let this woman ensorcell him. He must not let her control his mind!</p><p>Leaving the office, he went to his bedchamber, poured himself a tall goblet of sack, then downed it. Only after he\u2019d downed a second and third helping as quickly as possible, did he feel the warmth of the wine coursing through his veins. He would drown his images of her. He would drink until he couldn\u2019t hear her, see her, smell her . . . or remember her.</p><p>For a while the wine worked and he was able to still the images in his head. Content, feeling calm, Nicholas stretched out on his bed and was asleep instantly.</p><p>But then the images came again, this time in the form of dreams.</p><p>\u201cYou must tell me if Kit has shown you the door,\u201d he heard the woman saying. \u201cTell me if you cut your arm.\u201d \u201cKit died and you caused it.\u201d \u201cWhat if you are wrong?\u201d The woman\u2019s voice grew louder, urgent. \u201cWhat if you are wrong and Kit dies because you won\u2019t listen?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas awoke sweating, and the rest of the night he lay with his eyes open, afraid to go back to sleep. Something had to be done about the woman if she wouldn\u2019t let him sleep. Something had to be done.</p><p>TWENTY - SIX</p><p>At four A.M. Dougless crept out of the house to go to the fountain to take a shower. Yesterday a couple of the ladies had been talking about the suds in the fountain and Lady Margaret had looked at Dougless knowingly. Flushing, Dougless looked away, wondering if there was anything that went on in the Stafford household that Lady Margaret didn\u2019t know about.</p><p>Now Dougless smiled in memory. If it weren\u2019t all right for her to use the fountain for a shower, no doubt Lady Margaret would have told her so.</p><p>Even in the faint light, Dougless could see Lucy waiting for her. Poor lonely kid, she thought. Since yesterday, Dougless had asked questions and found out that Lucy and her guardian had been brought to England to the Stafford household when Lucy was just three years old. It was believed that she\u2019d make a better wife for Kit if she knew English ways and got to know her husband\u2019s family before marriage.</p><p>But from the moment Lucy had arrived, Lady Hallet had denied anyone access to the child, who had been very ill from the voyage across the Channel and the rough road journey across England. By the time Lucy was well, no one seemed to remember she was living with them.</p><p>Something Dougless had noticed about the sixteenth century was that the adults didn\u2019t idolize children the way twentieth-century Americans did. It had surprised Dougless to find out that most of Lady Margaret\u2019s ladies were married, and two of them had young children at their homes, which were often a hundred miles away. The women didn\u2019t seem to be in any throes of agony over whether or not they were spending \u201cquality time\u201d with their children. Dougless once, over embroidery\u2014which they did very well and at which Dougless was hopelessly clumsy\u2014mentioned that in her country women spent whole days with their children, entertaining them, teaching them, and trying never to be bored by them. The women had been horrified by this idea. They believed you should ignore children until they were of marriageable age. After all, they said, children died easily and their souls weren\u2019t formed until they were of age. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dougless had returned to her embroidery. Heretofore, she\u2019d thought parents had always, throughout time, adored their children. She\u2019d thought that mothers were always agonizing over whether or not they gave enough to their children. But there seemed to be more differences between the twentieth century and the sixteenth than just clothes and politics.</p><p>Now, looking at Lucy, she could feel the girl\u2019s loneliness. She was a stranger in a house where she\u2019d lived since she was a toddler, yet she knew fewer people than Dougless did.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d Dougless said.</p><p>Lucy smiled broadly, then caught herself and resumed her stiff pose. \u201cGood morn,\u201d she said formally. \u201cDo you mean to do this again?\u201d she asked as Dougless started to remove her robe, then turned away as Dougless stepped, nude, into the fountain.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day,\u201d Dougless said as she gave a whistle for the boy to turn the wheel. She gasped at the icy water, but a clean body was worth some discomfort.</p><p>Lucy remained turned away while Dougless bathed and washed her hair, but when the girl didn\u2019t leave, Dougless sensed that there was something she wanted. But perhaps it was only that she wanted a friend.</p><p>Dougless got out of the fountain-shower, dried, then turned to Lucy. \u201cThis morning we\u2019re going to play charades. Maybe you\u2019d like to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Lord Christopher attend?\u201d she asked quickly.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Dougless said, understanding. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>Lucy slumped down on a bench as though she were a beach ball that had suddenly been deflated. \u201cNay, I will not attend.\u201d</p><p>As Dougless toweled her wet hair, she looked at Lucy thoughtfully. How did a dumpy-figured, not-very-pretty adolescent capture the attention of a gorgeous hunk like Kit?</p><p>\u201cHe talks of you,\u201d Lucy said sullenly.</p><p>Dougless sat beside her on the bench. \u201cKit talks about me? When do you see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe visits me most days.\u201d</p><p>Kit would, Dougless thought. He seemed awfully thoughtful and kind\u2014and he probably considered visiting his future wife his duty. \u201cKit talks to you of me, but what do you talk to him about?\u201d</p> <p>Lucy wrung her hands in her lap. \u201cI say naught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing? You don\u2019t say anything to him? He comes to visit you every day and you just sit there like a bump on a log?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Hallet says it would be unseemly for me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dougless couldn\u2019t control her anger. \u201cLady Hallet! That ogre? That woman is so ugly that the sight of the back of her head would crack a mirror.\u201d</p><p>Lucy giggled. \u201cA hawk once went to her instead of to its master. I thought the hawk mistook her for its mate.\u201d</p><p>Dougless laughed. \u201cWith that beak of hers I can understand the mistake.\u201d</p><p>Lucy laughed aloud, then covered her mouth. \u201cI wish I were like you,\u201d she said wistfully. \u201cIf I could make my Kit laugh . . .\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to say more to make Dougless understand. \u201cMy Kit,\u201d as in \u201cmy Nicholas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we could find a way to make Kit laugh. I was thinking about doing a vaudeville routine with Honoria, but maybe you and I could do it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2018Vaudeville\u2019? \u2018Routine\u2019? I do not believe Lady Hallet will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucy\u201d\u2014Dougless took the girl\u2019s hands in hers\u2014\u201csomething that I\u2019ve found that hasn\u2019t changed over time is that if you want the man, you have to fight for him. Now, what you want is for Kit to notice you, and what you need is a little self-confidence. You also need to trust your own judgment and not someone else\u2019s. So maybe we can accomplish a few of these things by putting on a show. Kit will see that you\u2019re no longer a little girl\u2014and so will Lady Hallet, for that matter\u2014and we\u2019ll both have a good time. So how about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know. I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did one duke say to the other duke?\u201d</p><p>Lucy looked blank.</p><p>\u201c\u2018That was no lady, that was my wife.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Lucy\u2019s mouth opened in shock; then she giggled.</p><p>\u201cWhere does a three-hundred-pound canary sit?\u201d Dougless paused. \u201cAnywhere he wants to.\u201d</p><p>Lucy laughed harder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do,\u201d Dougless said. \u201cYou\u2019ll do very well. Now, let\u2019s plan. When can we rehearse? No excuses. You\u2019re the heiress, remember, and Lady Hallet works for you.\u201d</p><p>By the time Dougless got back to the house, it was full daylight. She knew that many people had an idea of what she was doing each morning, for there were no secrets in the household, but everyone politely refrained from asking her point-blank.</p><p>In the mornings Lady Margaret was too busy to want any new games, so Dougless wandered into the gardens and soon found herself drawing the ABCs in the dirt for three children who worked in the kitchen. Before she realized it, it was time for dinner.</p><p>Neither Nicholas nor Kit came to dinner. Dougless vowed that after the meal she would look for Nicholas and again try to talk to him. At least now that she knew that Kit hadn\u2019t shown Nicholas the secret door at Bellwood, she knew Kit\u2019s \u201caccident\u201d was not imminent.</p><p>Smiling, she left the table and allowed Honoria to again try to teach her how to make lace from a bit of linen. Honoria was making a beautiful cuff with the word Dougless in it, surrounded by odd little birds and animals.</p><p>Bent over her embroidery frame, Dougless felt at peace. She was going to be able to help Lucy, and yesterday Nicholas had remembered something about their time in the twentieth century. She glanced at the big emerald ring on her thumb. Now that his memory had been jogged, surely he\u2019d soon remember more. She was going to be able to accomplish what she had failed to do the first time.</p><p>TWENTY - SEVEN</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s head hurt, and he didn\u2019t feel too steady on his feet. He\u2019d seen no more images after he stopped sleeping last night, but this morning he was still haunted by the dreams. \u201cWhat if you are wrong?\u201d he kept hearing in the woman\u2019s voice. Wrong about what? About her being a witch? The images she\u2019d put into his head were proof that he was right.</p><p>Groggily, he went downstairs to sword practice. He lunged with his sword at the man before him, not seeing the startled look on the knight\u2019s face. Nicholas wasn\u2019t usually aggressive in sword practice, but today, what with his head pounding and his anger, he felt aggressive. Again and again he lunged. The knight stepped back, his sword at his side.</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d the man said, astonished.</p><p>\u201cDo you mean to give me a good fight or not?\u201d Nicholas challenged, then lunged again. Perhaps if he was tired enough, he wouldn\u2019t be able to hear the woman or see her inside his mind.</p><p>Nicholas wore out three men before a fourth, fresh man brought him low. Nicholas went right when he should have gone left, and the man\u2019s blade neatly sliced his left forearm open almost to the bone. While Nicholas stood there staring at his bleeding arm, an image came to him. But this image was different, he didn\u2019t just see it, he was in the dream.</p><p>He was walking beside the red-haired woman in a strange place, and they stopped before a building with glass windows, but windows such as he\u2019d never dreamed existed, with glass so clear it was as though it were not there. A machine, a big, strange machine with wheels went by, but he didn\u2019t seem to be interested in it. Instead, he was intent only on talking to the woman and telling her of the scar on his arm. He was telling her that Kit had drowned on the day he\u2019d hurt his arm at sword practice.</p><p>He came out of the dream as abruptly as he went into it, and when he returned to the present, he was lying on the ground, his men hovering anxiously over him, one of them trying to stop the flow of blood.</p><p>Nicholas had no time to give over to pain. \u201cSaddle two horses,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cone with a woman\u2019s saddle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRide?\u201d asked one man. \u201cYou mean to ride with a woman? But, my lord, your arm\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nicholas turned to him with cold eyes. \u201cFor the Montgomery woman, she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can ride only enough to keep from falling from the horse,\u201d said another man, contempt in his voice.</p><p>Awkwardly, and with help, Nicholas got to his feet. \u201cBind my arm so the bleeding stops, then saddle two horses\u2014with men\u2019s saddles. Do it now,\u201d he said. \u201cWaste no time.\u201d His voice was low, but there was command in it.</p><p>\u201cShould I fetch the woman?\u201d another man asked.</p><p>Nicholas, his arm held out while a man bound a cloth tightly about it, looked up at the windows of the house. \u201cShe will come,\u201d he said with confidence. \u201cWe do but wait.\u201d</p><p>Hunched over her embroidery frame, Dougless was listening to one of the ladies telling a juicy story about a woman who\u2019d tried to bed another woman\u2019s husband. Dougless was listening to the story with all her attention when suddenly a fierce, burning pain stabbed her left forearm.</p><p>With a cry of pain, Dougless fell back on the stool and landed on the floor. \u201cMy arm. Something has hurt my arm.\u201d She cradled her arm to her, tears of pain coming instantly.</p><p>Leaping to her feet, Honoria ran to kneel by Dougless. \u201cRub her hands, do not let her faint,\u201d Honoria commanded as she quickly untied Dougless\u2019s sleeve at the shoulder and slipped it down. Honoria winced at Dougless\u2019s moan of pain as she had to pull Dougless\u2019s arm away from her breast to remove the sleeve. Once the sleeve was off, Honoria pushed the linen undersleeve up to look at Dougless\u2019s arm.</p><p>There was nothing wrong with it. The skin was not even reddened.</p><p>\u201cI see nothing,\u201d Honoria said, suddenly afraid. She\u2019d grown to care for Dougless, but the woman was very odd. Sir Nicholas accused her of being a witch. Was this pain a manifestation of her witchcraft?</p><p>The pain in her arm was blinding, but when Dougless looked down, she saw that there was nothing wrong with her forearm. \u201cIt feels as though it\u2019s been cut,\u201d she whispered, \u201cas though someone has cut it deeply with a knife.\u201d</p><p>She used her right hand to rub her forearm, but she could barely feel her own touch. \u201cI can feel the cut,\u201d she whispered, trying not to whimper. The women around her were looking at her strangely, as though Dougless weren\u2019t quite sane.</p><p>Suddenly, Dougless could hear Nicholas\u2019s voice in her head. They were in bed together and she\u2019d touched the scar on his left forearm. He said he\u2019d been injured on the day Kit had drowned.</p><p>Dougless was on her feet instantly. \u201cWhere do the men practice swords?\u201d she asked, trying not to sound frantic. Please, God, she prayed, do not let me be too late.</p><p>At her remark, the other women seemed to be assured of Dougless\u2019s lack of sanity, but Honoria answered. Nothing Dougless did could surprise her. \u201cTo the back, past the maze, through the northeast gate.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Dougless wasted no more time. She grabbed her skirts, thanked heaven for the farthingale that held the skirts away from her legs, then began to run. In the hall she crashed into a man, and when he fell, she leaped over him. A woman in the kitchen was getting something off a high shelf. Crouching, Dougless kept running under her arms. A wagonload of barrels had come untied, and Dougless leaped five barrels, one after another, looking like an oddly dressed Olympic hurdler. She ran past Lady Margaret outside the maze, but when the woman called to her, Dougless didn\u2019t answer. When the gate in the wall at the back of the maze stuck, Dougless lifted her foot and smashed it open.</p><p>Once outside the gardens, she ran as fast as she could.</p><p>Nicholas, his arm swathed in a bloody bandage, was sitting on a horse and watching her progress toward him.</p><p>\u201cKit!\u201d Dougless screamed, still running. \u201cWe have to save Kit.\u201d</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t say any more because a man swooped her into his arms and dumped her onto a horse, and, oh, thank all that was holy, it was a man\u2019s saddle. She jammed her feet into the stirrups, grabbed the reins, and looked at Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cWe ride!\u201d he shouted as he kicked his horse forward.</p><p>The wind in her eyes stung and her arm still hurt, but most of Dougless\u2019s concentration was on following Nicholas. Behind them thundered three men trying to keep up with them.</p><p>They ran across plowed fields, through gardens of cabbages and turnips. They ran through the dirty, barren yards of peasants, and for once Dougless gave no thought to equality as their horses\u2019 hooves destroyed crops and even once, a shed. They ran into the woods, tree branches low overhead. Dougless put her head down on the horse\u2019s neck and kept going. Leaving the trail, Nicholas headed into the forest. Even though there was no path, the forest floor was clear of deadfall, for even twigs were needed for firewood, so, except for the overhanging branches, their way was unhampered.</p><p>Dougless never thought to question how Nicholas knew where Kit was, but she was sure he did know. Just as he\u2019d known she would come when he hurt his arm, he knew where his brother was.</p><p>They broke through the trees into a clearing, and ahead, surrounded by more trees, sparkled a pretty, spring-fed pond. Nicholas was off his horse while it was still running, and Dougless followed him, tearing her heavy, long skirt when it caught on the saddle.</p><p>When she reached the pond and looked down, what she saw chilled her. Three men were carrying Kit\u2019s nude, lifeless body out of the water. Kit\u2019s body was facedown, his long dark hair falling forward, his neck limp and lifeless.</p><p>Nicholas was staring at his brother. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, then, \u201cNO!\u201d</p><p>Shoving past Nicholas, Dougless went to the men holding Kit. \u201cPut him down here,\u201d she ordered. \u201cOn his back.\u201d</p><p>Kit\u2019s men hesitated.</p><p>\u201cObey her!\u201d Nicholas bellowed from close behind her.</p><p>\u201cPray,\u201d she said to the man nearest her as she straddled Kit. \u201cI need all the help I can get. Pray for a miracle.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, the men went to their knees, their hands clasped, their heads bowed.</p><p>Nicholas knelt before Kit\u2019s inert body and placed his hands on Kit\u2019s wet head. When he looked at Dougless, his eyes showed that he trusted her in whatever she did to his beloved brother\u2019s inert body.</p><p>Dougless pushed Kit\u2019s head back to make a straight line of his air ducts, then began to give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Nicholas\u2019s eyes widened as he watched, but he did not try to stop her. \u201cKit, please,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease live,\u201d then she again forced air into his lungs.</p><p>When she was ready to give up hope, Kit coughed, then was silent.</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s head came up as he looked at Dougless. \u201cCome on, come on,\u201d she said. \u201cBreathe, damn you!\u201d With Nicholas\u2019s help, she pushed Kit onto his side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kit gave another cough, then another, then he vomited water as his lungs cleared.</p><p>Rolling off of him, Dougless put her face in her hands and burst into tears.</p><p>Nicholas held his brother\u2019s shoulders while Kit got rid of the water. A knight draped his cape about Kit\u2019s bare lower half, while the other men stared down at Dougless. Her hair was down, her dress torn, she\u2019d lost a shoe, and Nicholas\u2019s blood was on one sleeve and the other sleeve was missing.</p><p>At last Kit quit coughing and leaned back against his brother. Tiredly, Kit looked at Nicholas\u2019s arm that was wrapped tightly about his chest. His brother\u2019s blood trickled down Kit\u2019s bare, wet chest. Kit looked up at his men, and saw all six of them staring down at the Montgomery woman who was crying softly into her hands.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a fine way to treat a man back from the dead,\u201d Kit managed to croak out. \u201cMy brother bleeds on me, and a pretty woman sheds tears. Is no one glad that I yet live?\u201d</p><p>If anything, Nicholas\u2019s grip on Kit tightened. Dougless looked up, wiped her eyes with the back of her hand, and sniffed. A knight handed her a handkerchief. \u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured, then blew her nose.</p><p>\u201cThe maid has saved you,\u201d one of the knights said, awe in his voice. \u201cIt is a miracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitchcraft,\u201d muttered another man.</p><p>Nicholas looked up at the man, his eyes black with threat. \u201cYou call her witch again and you will not live to repeat the words.\u201d</p> <p>The men knew that Nicholas meant what he said.</p><p>When Dougless looked at Nicholas, she knew that his hatred of her was over, and that now he\u2019d listen to her. She blew her nose again, then tried to stand. When she stumbled, one of the men helped her up, but they were all looking at her as though she were part saint, part demon.</p><p>\u201cOh, heavens,\u201d she said, \u201cstop looking at me like that. This is a common practice in my country. We have lots of water and people are always drowning. Really, what I did was no miracle.\u201d</p><p>To her relief, she could see the men believed her, but probably only because they wanted to.</p><p>\u201cNow, I want all of you to stop standing around and get busy. Poor Kit must be freezing, and, Nicholas, your arm is a mess. You two help Kit, and you two see if there are any clean bandages for Nicholas\u2019s arm, and you two go see if the horses survived the trip. Now go! Scurry!\u201d</p><p>One advantage women throughout time have had is that the little boy in men always remembers a time when women were all-powerful. The men bumped into each other as they ran to do her bidding.</p> <p>\u201cYou have a shrew on your hands, brother,\u201d Kit said happily. Nicholas still held his brother tightly, as though he were afraid Kit would die if he released him. \u201cPerhaps you would fetch my clothes for me,\u201d Kit said softly to Nicholas, then shook his head as Dougless started for Kit\u2019s clothes piled on the bank of the pond.</p><p>Slowly, Nicholas released his hold on his brother and started to rise, but he swayed on his feet. The loss of blood, combined with his ride and his fear, had weakened him. Standing to one side, Dougless watched as Nicholas slowly made his way to the bank, picked up Kit\u2019s clothes, then took them back to his brother.</p><p>Kit accepted the clothes with the solemnity of a king receiving the crown at his coronation, then he grinned. \u201cSit down, little brother,\u201d he said.</p><p>When Nicholas took a step, he swayed, so Dougless caught him in her arms and led him to sit down; then she sat beside him. Turning, Nicholas put his head on her lap.</p><p>Kit laughed. \u201cNow that is more the brother I know.\u201d He looked up as his men came back into the clearing.</p><p>Dougless looked down at Nicholas and stroked his sweat-dampened black curls. This was, at long last, her Nicholas. Here again was the man she\u2019d loved and lost.</p><p>\u201cDo you grow onion-eyed again?\u201d</p><p>His words, so heart-stoppingly familiar, did indeed bring tears to her eyes. \u201cThe wind,\u201d she murmured. \u201cNothing more.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cGive me your arm. I want to see what you\u2019ve done to it.\u201d</p> <p>Obediently, he held up his arm, and her stomach lurched. The bandage was saturated with blood and his hand was encrusted, as well as his sleeve above the wrappings.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI do not believe I will lose the arm. The leeches\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeeches!\u201d Dougless said. \u201cYou can\u2019t afford more blood loss.\u201d Glancing up, she saw that Kit was now dressed, but he was so weak that he was being supported as the men led him to his horse.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, get up. We\u2019re going back to take care of that arm,\u201d Dougless said.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d he said. \u201cI would the two of us stayed here.\u201d</p><p>He had that look in his eye, that soft, sexy, hooded look that promised he would make Dougless glad she stayed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, even as she bent down to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cA woman\u2019s \u2018no\u2019 pleases me much,\u201d Nicholas said softly, his uninjured arm moving up to her hair.</p><p>Their lips didn\u2019t meet.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t,\u201d Dougless said sternly. \u201cUp! I mean it, Nicholas, get up. You aren\u2019t going to sweet-talk me into doing whatever you want while your arm turns to gangrene. We\u2019re going back to the house and clean up the wound; then we\u2019ll get Honoria to sew it back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonoria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can sew better than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThe arm does pain me some.\u201d Slowly, reluctantly, he lifted his head from her lap, but, as he moved past her lips, he planted a quick, sweet kiss on them.</p><p>They rode slowly back to the Stafford house, and as they approached, Dougless tried to straighten her spine and her clothing. But her dress, torn and bloody, was beyond repair. In the wild ride, she\u2019d lost her little pearl-studded cap. As they drew nearer to the house, Dougless remembered running past Lady Margaret and not speaking, and, too, practically before the lady\u2019s face, she\u2019d kicked the gate open. And now here she was, looking like something off the streets, riding astride, her skirts up to her calves.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I can face your mother,\u201d Dougless said to Nicholas.</p><p>He gave her a puzzled look, but turned away when he heard a shout. One of the guards had ridden ahead, so the news of Kit\u2019s near-death had reached the household. Lady Margaret and all her ladies were waiting to greet them. At the sight, Dougless swallowed in fear. Would she again be accused of witchcraft?</p><p>As soon as Kit dismounted, Lady Margaret clasped her eldest son to her; then she turned to Dougless.</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, my lady,\u201d Dougless said, \u201cfor my appearance. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Taking Dougless\u2019s face in her hands, Lady Margaret kissed her on both cheeks. \u201cYou are beautiful to me,\u201d she said, her voice full of her gratitude.</p><p>Dougless felt her face grow pink with embarrassment, but also with pleasure.</p><p>Turning to Nicholas, Lady Margaret glanced at his bloody arm, then yelled, \u201cLeech!\u201d</p><p>At that, Dougless put herself between mother and son. \u201cPlease, my lady, may I see to his arm? Please,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHonoria will help me.\u201d</p><p>Lady Margaret seemed to be torn. \u201cDo you have a tablet for wounds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, just soap and water and disinfectant. Please, let me care for him.\u201d</p><p>After a look over Dougless\u2019s shoulder to Nicholas, Lady Margaret nodded.</p><p>Once upstairs in Nicholas\u2019s bedchamber, Dougless gave Honoria a list of things she\u2019d need. \u201cThe strongest, harshest soap you have, something with lye in it; then I want a kettle for boiling water, and I\u2019ll need needles\u2014silver needles\u2014white silk thread, beeswax, my tote bag, and the cleanest, whitest linen in this house.\u201d Three maids scurried to do her bidding.</p><p>When she was alone with Nicholas, she had him soak his bandaged arm in a long copper pan of boiled water she had taken from the kettle over the fireplace. He was bare from the waist up, and as efficient as Dougless tried to be, she could feel his hot eyes on her.</p><p>\u201cTell me of what we once were each to the other.\u201d</p><p>Dougless put more water on to boil. \u201cYou came to me in my time.\u201d Now that he was ready to listen, she found herself reluctant to talk. The Nicholas who accused her of witchcraft had no power over her, but this Nicholas, who looked at her with sparkling eyes, made her toes curl.</p><p>When she went back to him, she saw that the dried blood had softened away from the bandages. Propping his arm on the pan, she took small sewing scissors and began to snip away the encrusted bandage.</p><p>\u201cWere we lovers?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Dougless\u2019s breath drew in sharply. \u201cI cannot do this if you don\u2019t hold still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not move, you did,\u201d he said, then watched her for a while. \u201cWere we together long? Did we love much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Nicholas,\u201d she said and found to her shame that tears were again coming to her eyes. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that. You came to me for a reason. You had been found guilty of treason, and you came to my time because Lady Margaret\u2019s papers had been found. You and I researched to find out who had betrayed you.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she began to peel strips of linen off his arm.</p><p>\u201cDid we find the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWe did not. I found out the truth after you went back, after you . . .\u201d She looked up at him. \u201cAfter you had been executed.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s face was changing, losing its look of sex. He could no longer continue to not listen to the woman. She had known about the servants in the closet when he and Arabella had been fumbling on the table. And she had known about Kit. His heart hammered in his chest when he thought how close he had come to losing Kit. If the woman had not been there, Kit would have died.</p><p>And it would have been Nicholas\u2019s fault, he thought. His own fault and no one else\u2019s, because he\u2019d lied when she\u2019d asked him about the cabinet at Bellwood. She had said that Kit showed Nicholas the cabinet a week before his death, but Nicholas had not listened. He had heard only that she spoke of his handsome brother. His jealousy had nearly cost his brother\u2019s life.</p><p>Nicholas leaned back against the pillows. \u201cWhat more do you know?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to tell him of Lettice, but she couldn\u2019t, not yet. It was too soon and he didn\u2019t yet trust her enough. She knew he loved Lettice deeply. He had so much wanted to leave the twentieth century\u2014and Dougless\u2014to get back to his beloved wife. It would take more time before she had his trust enough that she could talk to him about his beloved Lettice. Certainly, now was not the time.</p><p>\u201cI will tell you everything later,\u201d she said, \u201cbut now I must see to your arm.\u201d</p><p>Dougless continued pulling the bandage from his wound until she at last saw the deep slash. She\u2019d never been good with bloody wounds, but years of teaching elementary school had taught her to look at chipped teeth, blood-dripping wounds, and broken limbs while remaining cheerful for the child\u2019s sake. She knew Nicholas\u2019s wound needed a doctor, but she also knew that now she was the best that was available.</p><p>When Honoria and the maids returned with all Dougless had ordered, she set them to work. Honoria did not allow the maids to question anything Dougless told them to do. The four women removed their outer sleeves, rolled up the linen sleeves above the elbow; then Dougless had them scour their hands and arms while she boiled needles and silk thread.</p><p>The only sedative-type pills she had in her tote bag were what she took to calm her nervous stomach. She wished she had good ol\u2019 Valium, but she didn\u2019t. She gave Nicholas two pills and hoped they\u2019d make him drowsy.</p><p>They did, and within minutes, he was asleep.</p><p>When all the equipment was as clean as she could get it, Dougless set Honoria to sewing Nicholas\u2019s arm. Honoria blanched, but Dougless insisted because Honoria\u2019s stitches were fine and accurate.</p><p>Dougless wasn\u2019t sure exactly how to do it, but she directed Honoria to sew the gash in Nicholas\u2019s arm in two layers. The inside stitches would have to remain in his arm forever, but Dougless\u2019s father had a steel plate in his leg from his time in the military, so she guessed Nicholas could live with some silk inside his arm. Dougless carefully held Nicholas\u2019s skin together while Honoria sewed it.</p><p>When Nicholas\u2019s wound was sewn together, Dougless wrapped his arm in clean linen. She told the maids she wanted them to boil linen to be used the next day, and when they touched the linen, their hands were to be very clean. Honoria said she would see to it.</p><p>Finally, Dougless dismissed all of them; then she sat down on a chair by the fire and proceeded to wait\u2014and to worry. If Nicholas developed a fever she had no penicillin, no oral antibiotics, nothing but a few aspirin. She told herself she needn\u2019t worry because she knew Nicholas\u2019s future, but today she had changed history. If Kit didn\u2019t die, then perhaps Nicholas would. Would she go back to the twentieth century and find that Kit had lived to a grand old age, but his younger brother had died from an infected cut on his arm? History, or in this case, the future, was different from now on.</p><p>Hours later, Dougless was dozing in the chair when the door opened and Honoria entered. In her arms was a beautiful gown of deep purple velvet, the color of an eggplant, with wide, trailing sleeves of soft white ermine, the little black tails sewn on at intervals.</p><p>\u201cLady Margaret sends this to you,\u201d Honoria whispered so as not to disturb Nicholas. \u201cIt will have to be fit to you, but I thought you might see it now.\u201d</p><p>Dougless touched the soft velvet. It wasn\u2019t like modern rayon velvet or heavy cotton velvet, but this was all silk and glistened as only silk could. \u201cHow is Kit?\u201d Dougless whispered.</p><p>\u201cSleeping. He says someone tried to kill him. When he swam out to the girl, someone, or maybe two of them, came from under the water, caught his legs, and pulled him under.\u201d</p><p>Dougless looked away. In Lady Margaret\u2019s account found in the wall, she said she believed that Kit had been murdered, that his drowning had not been an accident.</p><p>\u201cIf you had not known how to raise him from the dead . . .\u201d Honoria whispered.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t raise anyone from the dead,\u201d Dougless said sharply. \u201cThere was no magic or witchcraft involved.\u201d</p><p>Honoria gave her a hard look. \u201cYour arm no longer pains you? It is well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine now, just a dull ache. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d Breaking off, she refused to meet Honoria\u2019s eyes. Yes, there was magic involved. Her feeling the pain of Nicholas\u2019s cut arm was the least of the magic, but Honoria didn\u2019t need to be told that.</p><p>\u201cYou should rest now,\u201d Honoria said. \u201cAnd change your gown.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dougless glanced at Nicholas, still asleep. \u201cI must stay with him. If he wakes, I want to be here. I can\u2019t risk his having a fever. Do you think Lady Margaret would mind if I stay here?\u201d</p><p>Honoria smiled. \u201cWere you now to ask for deeds to half the Stafford estates, I do not believe Lady Margaret would deny you.\u201d</p><p>Dougless smiled back. \u201cI just want Nicholas to be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will bring you a robe,\u201d Honoria said, then left the room.</p> <p>An hour later, Dougless had removed her torn and dirty gown, as well as her steel corset, and now she sat before a warm fire, wearing a pretty ruby red brocade robe. Every few minutes she put her hand to Nicholas\u2019s forehead. It was warm, but he didn\u2019t seem to be running more than a few degrees of temperature.</p><p>TWENTY - EIGHT</p><p>The shadows in the room lengthened and still Nicholas slept. A maid brought Dougless food on a tray, but Nicholas did not waken. As night fell, she lit candles and looked down at him, so peaceful on the bed, his dark curls vivid against his pale skin. For hours she\u2019d done nothing but watch him, but when she saw no signs of fever, she began to relax and look about her.</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s room was adorned richly, as befitted a son of the house. His mantelpiece had several plates and goblets of gold and silver on it, and Dougless smiled when she looked at them. She\u2019d come to understand what Nicholas had meant when he\u2019d said his wealth was in his house. Since there were no banks to hold the wealth of a great family like the Staffords, all they had was put into gold and silver and jewels, which were formed into beautiful objects. Smiling, she touched a pitcher and thought that her family\u2019s wealth would be a lot more enjoyable if their stocks and bonds were turned into gold dishes.</p><p>Beside the fireplace was a long row of tiny oval portraits, all done in exquisite colors. Most of them were people she didn\u2019t know, but one of them had to be Lady Margaret as a young woman. There was a hint of Nicholas\u2019s eyes in hers. There was an older man who had the shape of Nicholas\u2019s jaw. His father? she wondered. There was a miniature oil of Kit. And on the bottom was Nicholas.</p> <p>She took the portrait from the wall, held it a moment and caressed it. What had happened to these portraits in the twentieth century? she wondered. Were they hanging on some museum wall with \u201cUnknown Man\u201d on a card beside them?</p><p>Still holding the portrait, she walked about the room. There was a cushioned seat beneath the window, and Dougless went to it. She knew the top lifted and she wondered what Nicholas kept inside. Glancing at him to make sure he was asleep, she put the portrait on a shelf, then lifted the seat. It creaked but not too loudly.</p><p>Inside the seat were rolls of paper tied with pieces of yarn. She took one, untied the string, then unrolled it out on a table. It was a sketch of a house, and Dougless knew instantly that the house was Thornwyck Castle.</p><p>\u201cDo you pry?\u201d Nicholas asked from the bed, making Dougless jump.</p><p>She went to him and felt his forehead. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess well than if there were not a woman invading my private goods.\u201d</p> <p>Dougless thought he sounded just like a little boy whose mother had looked inside his secret box. She picked up the plan. \u201cHave you shown these to anyone besides me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not shown them to you,\u201d he said as he made a lunge for the corner of the paper, but Dougless moved away. Weakly, he lay back against the pillows.</p><p>Dougless put the plan down. \u201cHungry?\u201d She ladled soup into a silver-bowl from a pan on the hearth, which had been set there to keep the soup warm. Sitting beside Nicholas, she began to feed him. At first he protested that he could feed himself but, like all men, he soon adjusted to being pampered.</p><p>\u201cYou have looked long at the drawings?\u201d he asked between bites.</p><p>\u201cI had just opened the one. When do you plan to start building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is merely foolishness. Kit will\u2014\u201d He broke off, then smiled.</p><p>Dougless knew what he was thinking, that he\u2019d come so very close to losing Kit.</p><p>\u201cMy brother is well?\u201d Nicholas asked.</p> <p>\u201cPerfectly healthy. Better than you. He didn\u2019t lose enough blood to flood a river.\u201d When she wiped his lips with a napkin, he caught her fingertips and kissed them.</p><p>\u201cIf I live, then I owe you my life as well as my brother\u2019s. What can I do to repay you?\u201d</p><p>Love me, Dougless almost said. Fall in love with me again, just as you did before. Look at me with eyes of love. I\u2019ll stay in the sixteenth century forever, if you\u2019ll love me. I would give up cars and dentists and proper bathrooms if you\u2019d love me again. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want both of you to be well and for history to come out all right.\u201d She put the empty bowl on a table. \u201cYou should sleep more. Your arm needs to heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have slept all I need. Stay and entertain me.\u201d</p><p>Dougless grimaced. \u201cI\u2019ve run out of entertainments. There isn\u2019t a game I ever played or a song I ever heard that I haven\u2019t dredged out of my memory. I\u2019m just about played out.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas smiled at her. Sometimes he didn\u2019t understand her words, but he nearly always got the meaning.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you entertain me?\u201d She picked up his sketch. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cPut those away!\u201d He started to sit up, but Dougless pushed him back to the pillows.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, please don\u2019t tear your stitches. You must be still. And stop glowering at me! I know all about your love of architecture. When you came to me in the future, you had already started building Thornwyck Castle.\u201d She almost laughed at the expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I planned this for Thornwyck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. When you came to me, it was four years from now and you\u2019d already done it. Actually you\u2019d only started it. It was never finished because you . . . you . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere executed,\u201d he said, and for the first time he really thought about her words. \u201cI wish you to tell me all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the beginning?\u201d Dougless asked. \u201cIt will take a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that Kit is safe, I have time.\u201d</p><p>Until Lettice gets hold of you, she thought. \u201cI was in a church in Ashburton, and I was crying,\u201d she said, \u201cand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you weep? Why were you in Ashburton? And you cannot stand and tell me this long story. No, do not sit there. Here.\u201d</p><p>He patted the empty half of the bed beside him.</p><p>\u201cNicholas, I can\u2019t get in bed with you.\u201d Just the thought of being so near him made her heart beat faster.</p><p>Opening his eyes, he smiled at her. \u201cI saw a . . . a dream of you. You were in a white box of sorts, water was pouring on you, and you wore no clothes.\u201d He looked her up and down, as though he could see through the voluminous robe. \u201cI do not believe you have always been so shy of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said hoarsely, remembering being in the shower stall with him, the \u201cwhite box\u201d of his dream. \u201cOne night we were not shy of each other, and the next morning you were taken away from me. I\u2019m afraid now that if I touch you, I\u2019ll be returned to my own time, and I can\u2019t go yet. There is more for me to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou know of others who die? My mother? Is Kit not yet safe?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him. Her Nicholas. Her lovely Nicholas who thought of others before himself. \u201cYou are the one who is in danger.\u201d</p><p>He smiled in relief. \u201cI can care for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a pig\u2019s eye you can! If I hadn\u2019t been here, you\u2019d probably have lost your arm or died from the wound. One of those idiots you call a physician had only to touch that cut with his filthy hands and presto! you\u2019re a goner.\u201d Of course that hadn\u2019t happened the first time he\u2019d cut his arm, but . . .</p><p>Nicholas blinked at her. \u201cYou do talk most strangely. Come, sit by me and tell me all.\u201d When Dougless didn\u2019t move, he sighed. \u201cI swear to you on my honor I will not touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. Truthfully, she felt that she could trust him more than she could trust herself. Moving to the other side of the bed, she climbed up on it, for it was a few feet off the floor, then sank into the feather mattress.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you cry in the church?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>If Dougless could say nothing else about Nicholas, he was a good listener. He was more than a good listener, since he pulled from her things that she didn\u2019t want to tell him. In the end, she told him everything about Robert.</p><p>\u201cYou lived with him without marriage? Did not your father kill him for abducting you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like that in the twentieth century. Women have free choice, and fathers don\u2019t tell daughters what to do. Men and women are more equal in my time.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas snorted. \u201cIt seems that men still rule, for this man had all of you he wanted, but he did not make you his wife. He did not share his goods with you or demand his daughter respect you. And you say you chose this freely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . Well . . . It\u2019s not like you make it sound. Most of the time, Robert was very good to me. He and I had some good times together. It was only when Gloria was around that it was awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere a beautiful woman to give me all and in return I was only to give her, what do you say, a \u2018good time,\u2019 I, too, would be most grateful. Do all women of your time give themselves so cheaply?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not cheap. You just don\u2019t understand. Nearly everyone lives together before they get married. It\u2019s to see if we\u2019re compatible. And, besides, I thought Robert was going to ask me to marry him, but instead, he bought\u2014\u201d She stopped. Nicholas was making her feel as though she thought very little of herself. \u201cYou just don\u2019t understand, that\u2019s all. Men and women are different in the twentieth century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. I see. Yes. Women no longer want respect from a man, they want a \u2018good time\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they want respect; it\u2019s just that . . .\u201d She didn\u2019t know how to explain her living with Robert to a sixteenth-century man. In fact, now, living in the Elizabethan world, she could see that living with a man had cheapened her. Of course marriage was no guarantee that a man was going to respect her, but why hadn\u2019t she stood up to Robert and said, \u201cHow dare you treat me like this?\u201d or, \u201cNo, I will not pay for half of Gloria\u2019s plane fare,\u201d or, \u201cNo, I have too many things to do to pick up your dry cleaning?\u201d Right now she couldn\u2019t remember why she\u2019d let him walk over her that way.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to hear this story or not?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>Smiling, Nicholas lay back against the pillows. \u201cI wish to hear all of it.\u201d</p><p>After she was past his many questions about her relationship to Robert, she was able to continue. She told of crying on his tomb and of his suddenly being there and of her not believing who he was. She told of his walking in front of a bus.</p><p>She didn\u2019t get far after that because Nicholas started asking questions. It seemed he\u2019d had a vision of her on a two-wheeled vehicle and he wanted her to explain what it was. He wanted to know what a bus was. When she said she\u2019d called her sister, he wanted her to explain how a telephone worked.</p><p>Dougless couldn\u2019t describe all he wanted to know, so she got off the bed and got her tote bag. She pulled out her three magazines and started looking for photographs.</p><p>Once she showed him the magazines, there was no hope of continuing with her story. There was an Elizabethan saying, \u201cBetter unborn than untaught,\u201d and Nicholas seemed to epitomize that belief. He was insatiable in his curiosity, and he asked questions faster than Dougless could answer them.</p><p>When she couldn\u2019t find pictures to show him, she pulled out a spiral notebook, colored felt-tips, and began to draw. The pens and paper caused more questions.</p><p>Dougless was beginning to be exasperated because she couldn\u2019t continue her story, but then she realized that now that he believed her, she\u2019d have time in the future to tell him everything. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen I saw Thornwyck Castle, the tower on the left looked different than you drew it. And where are those curved windows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurved windows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this.\u201d Dougless began to sketch, but she wasn\u2019t very good at architectural rendering.</p><p>Rolling onto his side, Nicholas took the pen and made a beautiful perspective sketch of the windows. \u201cThis is like the windows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, exactly. We stayed in one of those rooms, and we could see the garden below. The church is just next door, and the guidebook said there used to be a wooden walkway from the church to the house.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back, Nicholas began to sketch. \u201cI have told no one of my plans, but you say that this was half built before I . . . before I was . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Yes. After Kit died and you were the earl, you had complete freedom to do what you wanted. I guess now that Kit\u2019s alive, you\u2019ll have to get his approval to build this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am no master builder,\u201d Nicholas said, looking at his sketch. \u201cWere Kit to need a new house, he would hire someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHire someone? Why? You can do it. These are beautiful drawings, and I\u2019ve seen Thornwyck Castle and happen to know it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI to be a tradesman?\u201d he asked, one eyebrow aloft haughtily.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d she said sternly, \u201cthere are many things I like about your century, but your class system and your sumptuary laws aren\u2019t part of what I like. In my century everyone works. It\u2019s embarrassing to be \u2018idle rich.\u2019 In England even royalty works. Princess Diana goes all over the world raising money for one charity after another. And the Princess Royal, well, I get tired just reading her schedule. Prince Andrew takes pictures; Princess Michael writes books. Prince Charles tries to keep England from looking like a Dallas office complex, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nicholas chuckled. \u201cIt is not so rare now that royalty works. Do you think our lovely new queen sits idle?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly Dougless remembered having read that one of the reasons Nicholas was executed was that some people were worried that he might go to court and seduce the young Queen Elizabeth. \u201cNicholas, you aren\u2019t thinking of going to court, are you? You wouldn\u2019t want to be one of her courtiers, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of her\u2014\u201d Nicholas asked, aghast. \u201cWhat do you know of this woman who is queen? Some say Mary of Scotland is the true queen and that the Staffords should join forces with others to put her on the throne.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that! Whatever you do, don\u2019t put your money on anyone but Elizabeth.\u201d As she spoke, Dougless wondered if she was changing history. If the Staffords and all their money had been put at Mary\u2019s disposal, would she have taken the throne? If Elizabeth weren\u2019t queen, would there have been a time when England was the reigning world power? If England weren\u2019t a world power that sent settlers to America, would America be speaking English? \u201cHeavy,\u201d she said under her breath, mocking a young cousin of hers.</p><p>\u201cWho will Elizabeth marry?\u201d Nicholas asked. \u201cWho will she put on the throne beside her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one, and don\u2019t start on me, because we\u2019ve already had this argument. Elizabeth marries no one, and she does a super job of running the country and a lot of the world with it. Now, are you going to let me tell you the rest of our story, or are you going to keep telling me that what did happen didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cYou gave yourself to a man for free and I came to save you. Yes, please continue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not exactly what happened, but . . .\u201d Trailing off, she looked at him. He had saved her. He\u2019d appeared in that church, sunlight flashing off his armor, taken her away from a man who didn\u2019t love her, and shown her the true give-and-take of love. With Nicholas she could be herself. She never had to think about having to please him; she just seemed to naturally please him. When she was growing up, she\u2019d tried so hard to be as perfect as her older sisters. But it seemed that every schoolteacher she ever had, had had all of her sisters in her classes before Dougless. And, by comparison, Dougless was always a disappointment. Dougless daydreamed, but her sisters never did. Dougless wasn\u2019t much good at sports, but her sisters had excelled. Her sisters had had millions of friends, but Dougless was always a bit shy and had always felt like an outsider.</p><p>Her parents had never compared her to her sisters. They never seemed to notice that the tennis trophies, equestrian trophies, baseball trophies, spelling bee medals, and science fair ribbons all belonged to their eldest daughters. Dougless had once won a third prize yellow ribbon at church for the best apple pie, and her father had proudly hung it up beside his other daughters\u2019 blue ribbons and purple best-of-show ribbons. The yellow had looked so strange and, to Dougless, so embarrassing, that she took the ribbon down.</p><p>All her life it seemed that Dougless had wanted to please people, but, somehow, she\u2019d never been able to. Her father kept saying that whatever she did was okay with him, but Dougless merely had to look at her sisters\u2019 accomplishments and she knew she needed to do something great. Robert had been an attempt to impress her family. Maybe Robert, a distinguished surgeon, was supposed to be the biggest trophy of all.</p><p>But Nicholas had saved her, she thought. Not in the way he meant. He hadn\u2019t saved her because he\u2019d pushed Robert out a door. No, he\u2019d saved her by respecting her, and, because of him, Dougless had begun to see herself through his eyes. When she thought about it, Dougless doubted very much if her sisters could have handled what had happened as well as she had. All of them were so sensible and so levelheaded they would probably have called the police on a man in armor who said he was from the sixteenth century. Not one of them would have been softhearted enough to take pity on a poor crazy man.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you smile so?\u201d Nicholas asked softly.</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking about my sisters. They\u2019re perfect people. Not a flaw in them, but I just realized that perfect can sometimes be a little lonely. Maybe I do try to please people, but I guess there are worse things. Maybe I should just find the right person to please.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas was obviously confused by this. He took her hand and began to kiss the palm. \u201cYou please me much.\u201d</p><p>She snatched her hand away. \u201cWe can\u2019t . . . touch each other,\u201d she said, stammering.</p><p>He looked at her through his lashes, his voice low. \u201cBut we have touched, have we not? I remember seeing you. I seem to know of touching you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Dougless whispered. \u201cWe have touched.\u201d They were alone on the bed, the room dark except for the golden glow of three candles.</p><p>\u201cIf we have touched, then it will not matter if we touch again in this life.\u201d His hands were reaching for her.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her eyes pleading. \u201cWe cannot. I would be returned to my own time.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas didn\u2019t move closer to her, and he couldn\u2019t understand why he stopped. But he could feel the urgency in her. Never before had a woman\u2019s \u201cno\u201d stopped him, because he soon found the women hadn\u2019t really meant no. But now, on the bed with this most desirable woman, he found himself listening to her words.</p><p>Leaning back against the pillows, he sighed. \u201cI am too weak to accomplish much,\u201d he said heavily.</p><p>Dougless laughed. \u201cSure, and if you believe that, I have some land in Florida to sell you.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas grinned, understanding her meaning. \u201cCome, then, sit close by me and tell me more of your time and of what we did there.\u201d He held up his uninjured arm, and Dougless, against her better judgment, moved near him.</p><p>Pulling her very close to the side of him, he wrapped his strong right arm about her. She pushed at him for a moment, then sighed and snuggled against his bare chest. \u201cWe bought you some clothes,\u201d she said, smiling in memory. \u201cAnd you attacked the poor clerk because the prices were so high. Afterward we went to tea. You loved tea. Then we found you a bed-and-breakfast.\u201d She paused. \u201cThat was the night you found me in the rain.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas was listening to her with half an ear. He wasn\u2019t yet sure he believed her story of past and future, but he was sure of how she felt in his arms. Her body next to his was something he remembered very well.</p><p>She was explaining that he\u2019d seemed able to \u201chear\u201d her. She said she wasn\u2019t quite sure how it worked, but she\u2019d used it the first day she\u2019d come to the sixteenth century. She had \u201ccalled\u201d to him in the rain, and he had come to her. She chided him for his rudeness on that day and for making her ride on the back of the horse. Later, when she was in the room in the attic, she had again \u201ccalled\u201d him.</p> <p>Nicholas didn\u2019t need further explanation of this, for he seemed to always feel what she felt. Now, as she lay in his arms, her head on his chest, he could feel her sense of comfort, but at the same time he felt her sexual excitement. He\u2019d never wanted to make love to a woman as much as he wanted to make love to her, but something stopped him.</p><p>She was telling of going to Bellwood and how he had shown her the secret door.</p><p>\u201cI believed you after that,\u201d she said. \u201cNot because you knew of the door, but because you were so hurt that the world remembered your misdeeds instead of all the good you had done. No one in the twentieth century knew for sure that you had designed Thornwyck Castle. There was nothing left behind to prove that you were the designer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a tradesman. I will not\u2014\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. \u201cI told you that in our world it\u2019s different. Talent is appreciated.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her, her face close to his, and put his fingertips under her chin. Ever so slowly he brought his lips to hers and kissed her gently.</p><p>Then he pulled back, startled. Her eyes were closed and her body was soft and pliant against his. He could take her, he knew that, but, still, something was stopping him. When he moved his hand from her chin, he found that it was trembling. He felt like a boy with his first woman. Except that the first time Nicholas had bedded a woman, he had been eager and enthusiastic, not trembling as he was now.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you to me?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Dougless said, her voice husky. \u201cI think maybe we were meant to be together. Even though we were born four hundred years apart, we were meant for each other.\u201d</p><p>He ran his hand down her face, then her neck, shoulder, and arm. \u201cYet I am not to bed you? I cannot take the clothes from your body and kiss your br**sts, kiss your legs, kiss\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas, please,\u201d she said, pushing out of his arms. \u201cThis is difficult enough as it is. All I know is that when we were together in the twentieth century, after we made love, you disappeared. I was holding you and you slipped right out of my grasp. I have you again now, so I don\u2019t want to lose you a second time. We can spend time together, we can talk, and we can be together in every way except physically.\u201d She paused. \u201cThat is, if you want me to stay with you.\u201d</p><p>As Nicholas looked at her, he felt the pain she\u2019d felt at their separation, but at the moment, he wanted to make love to her more than he wanted to understand anything.</p><p>Dougless saw what he was thinking, so when he lunged at her, she rolled off the bed. \u201cOne of us has to keep his wits. I want you to get some rest. Tomorrow we can talk more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not want to talk to you,\u201d he said sullenly.</p><p>Laughing, Dougless remembered all the things she\u2019d once done to entice him. She didn\u2019t need high heels now! \u201cTomorrow, my love. I must go now. It\u2019s almost dawn, and I must meet Lucy and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Lucy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Lucinda something or other. The girl Kit\u2019s to marry.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas snorted. \u201cA fat lump that.\u201d</p><p>Dougless\u2019s anger flared. \u201cNot beautiful like the woman you\u2019re to marry, is she?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas smiled. \u201cJealousy becomes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not jealous; I\u2019m\u2014\u201d She turned away. Jealousy didn\u2019t begin to describe what she felt for Lettice, but she said nothing. Nicholas had already made it clear that he loved the woman he was to marry, so she was sure he wouldn\u2019t listen to anything Dougless said against her. \u201cI have to go,\u201d she said at last. \u201cAnd I want you to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would sleep well if you would but stay with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d she said, smiling. She didn\u2019t dare go too near him again. She was tired from the excitement of the day and from a night without sleep. Lifting her tote bag, she stepped to the door, gave one last look at his bare chest, his skin dark against the white of the pillows; then hurriedly, before she changed her mind, she left the room.</p><p>Lucy was waiting for her by the fountain, and after Dougless had showered, they rehearsed their vaudeville act. Dougless was going to play the straight man, the dummy who asked the questions, so Lucy would get all the laughs.</p><p>At daybreak, Dougless made her way back to the house, and Honoria was waiting for her, holding up the purple velvet dress.</p><p>\u201cI thought I might take a nap,\u201d Dougless said, yawning.</p><p>\u201cLady Margaret and Lord Christopher await you. You are to be rewarded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any reward. I just want to help.\u201d Even as she said it, she knew her words were a lie. She wanted to live with Nicholas for the rest of her life. Sixteenth century, twentieth century, she didn\u2019t care which if she could just stay with him.</p><p>\u201cYou must come. You may ask for whatever you wish. A house. An income. A husband. A\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink they\u2019d let me have Nicholas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is pledged,\u201d Honoria said softly.</p><p>\u201cI know that only too well. Shall we start getting me harnessed?\u201d</p><p>After Dougless was dressed, Honoria led her to the Presence Chamber, where Lady Margaret and her oldest son were playing a game of chess.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Kit said when Dougless entered; then he lifted her hand and kissed it. \u201cThe angel of life who gave me back mine.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Dougless blushed.</p><p>\u201cCome, sit,\u201d Lady Margaret said, pointing to a chair. A chair, not a stool, so Dougless knew she was being greatly honored.</p><p>Kit stood behind his mother\u2019s chair. \u201cI wish to thank you for my life, and I wish to give you a gift, but I know not what you would wish. Name what you would have of me. And think high,\u201d he said, eyes twinkling, \u201cmy life is worth much to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is nothing I want,\u201d Dougless said. \u201cYou have given me kindness. You have fed and clothed me most sumptuously. There is nothing more I could want.\u201d Except Nicholas, she thought. Could you gift wrap him and send him to my apartment in Maine?</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Kit said, laughing. \u201cThere is something you must want. A chest of jewels perhaps. I have a house in Wales that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA house,\u201d Dougless said. \u201cYes, a house. I\u2019d like you to build a house in Thornwyck, and Nicholas is to draw the plans for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son?\u201d Lady Margaret asked, aghast.</p><p>\u201cYes, Nicholas. He\u2019s made some sketches for a house, and it will be beautiful. But he must have Kit\u2019s . . . I mean, Lord Christopher\u2019s backing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you would live in this house?\u201d Kit asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I mean, I don\u2019t want to own it. I just want Nicholas to be allowed to design it.\u201d</p><p>Both Kit and Lady Margaret stared at her. Dougless looked at the women around them, sitting at their embroidery frames. They were gaping.</p><p>Kit recovered first. \u201cYou may have your wish. My brother will get his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Thank you so very much.\u201d</p><p>No one in the room spoke again, so Dougless stood up. \u201cI believe I owe you a game of charades,\u201d she said to Lady Margaret.</p><p>Lady Margaret smiled. \u201cYou no longer need to earn your keep. My son\u2019s life has paid for you. Go and do what you wish.\u201d</p><p>Dougless at first started to protest that she didn\u2019t know what to do with herself, but then she figured she\u2019d think of something. \u201cThank you, my lady,\u201d she said, and bobbed a curtsy before leaving the room. Freedom, she thought, as she went back to Honoria\u2019s bedroom. No more having to entertain people. Good thing, since her store of songs was down to the McDonald\u2019s jingle.</p><p>Honoria\u2019s maid helped Dougless remove her new dress and corset (her old corset that was beginning to rust through its silk covering), and she went to bed smiling. She had prevented Nicholas from impregnating Arabella, and she\u2019d saved Kit. All that was left was to get rid of Lettice. If she could do that, she would change history. She fell asleep smiling.</p><p>TWENTY - NINE</p><p>What followed was, for Dougless, the happiest week of her life. Everyone in the Stafford household was pleased with her, and it seemed that she could do no wrong. She figured it would wear off in a few days, so she planned to enjoy it while it lasted.</p><p>She spent every minute she could with Nicholas. He wanted to know all about her twentieth century world, and he never tired of asking questions. He had difficulty believing her talk of automobiles, and airplanes he didn\u2019t believe at all. He went through everything in her tote bag. In the bottom were a couple of foil-wrapped tea bags, and Dougless made him a cup of tea with milk. As he\u2019d done the first time, he kissed her soundly in pleasure at the taste. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>In return for telling him of the twentieth century, he told her of his life. He showed her dances, took her hawking one day, then laughed at her when she refused to allow the lovely bird on her arm to fly away so it could kill its prey. He showed her buzzards in pens that were fed nothing but white bread for days to clean the carrion from their craws before they were butchered and eaten.</p><p>They argued about educating the \u201clower classes.\u201d And that led to a squabble about equality. When Nicholas said her America sounded violent and lonely, Dougless wished she hadn\u2019t told him so much.</p><p>He asked her hundreds of questions about the immediate future of England and especially about Queen Elizabeth. Dougless so wished she remembered more of what her father had told her so she could tell Nicholas.</p><p>He seemed fascinated with the idea of sea travel and with exploring her new country.</p> <p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll be here married to Lettice. You won\u2019t be able to go anywhere if you\u2019re executed.\u201d</p><p>As she\u2019d already found out, Nicholas would not listen to her when she spoke of his execution. He had a young man\u2019s belief that he was invincible and that nothing could hurt him. \u201cI will not raise an army to protect my lands in Wales because they are not my lands. They are Kit\u2019s, and if he is alive, then the future I once had will not be.\u201d</p><p>She had no argument for him. When she asked him who he thought had tried to kill Kit, Nicholas merely shrugged and said it was no doubt some ruffian. Dougless still couldn\u2019t get used to the idea of a land where there was no federal government and no police force. The nobility, besides having all the money, had all the power. They judged disputes, hanged people when they wanted to, and answered only to the queen. If the peasants had a good family to rule them, they were lucky, but many were not so fortunate.</p><p>One day Dougless asked Nicholas to take her to see a town. He raised an eyebrow at her and told her she would not like it, but he agreed to take her.</p><p>He was right. The peace and relative cleanliness of the Stafford household had not prepared her for the filth of a medieval town. Eight of Nicholas\u2019s men accompanied them to protect them from highwaymen. As they rode along the rutted road, Dougless looked at every shadow behind every tree. Being attacked by a dashing highwayman in a romantic novel was one thing, but she knew that, in reality, highwaymen were dangerous.</p> <p>The town was dirty beyond anything Dougless had ever imagined. People emptied kitchen slops and chamber pots into the streets. She saw adults who she was sure had never had a bath in their lives. At the corner of a bridge over a little river were tall pikes with rotting human heads on them.</p><p>She tried to look at all of it and see only the good. She tried to memorize what houses looked like and what the streets were like. If she did return to her time, she wanted to tell her father everything she\u2019d seen. But try as she might, she was so overwhelmed by the bad that it was all she could see. The houses were so close together that women passed things from the windows to each other. People shouted, animals screamed, and someone was beating on metal with a hammer. Filthy, diseased children ran up to them, clutching their legs and begging. Nicholas\u2019s men kicked them away, and Dougless, instead of feeling sympathy, felt herself recoiling from their touch.</p><p>When Nicholas turned and saw her pale face, he ordered his men to start for home. Once they were again in the open air, Dougless could breathe.</p><p>When Nicholas called a halt, tablecloths were spread under some trees and food was brought out. Nicholas handed her a goblet full of strong wine. With trembling hands, Dougless took the wine and drank deeply.</p><p>\u201cOur world is not like yours,\u201d Nicholas said. In the past days he had questioned her on every aspect of modern society, and his questions had included bathing and sewage drains.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, trying not to remember what that town had looked and smelled like. America had many homeless, but they did not live like these people did. Of course she had seen some well-dressed people in the town, but the sight of them could not take away from the stench. \u201cNo, a modern town is not like that.\u201d</p> <p>He stretched out beside her while she drank her wine. \u201cDo you still wish to remain in my time?\u201d</p><p>She was looking at him, but between them were the images of what she had just seen. If she stayed with Nicholas, that town would be part of her life. Whenever she left the safety of the Stafford house, she would see rotting heads on pikes and streets filled with the contents of chamber pots.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, looking into his eyes. \u201cI would stay if I could.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her hand and kissed it.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019d make the midwives wash their hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidwives? Ah, then you plan to have my children?\u201d</p><p>The thought of bearing a child without a proper doctor and hospital terrified her, but she didn\u2019t tell him that. \u201cA dozen at least,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her sleeve was too tight to push up, but she could feel his hot lips through her clothing. \u201cWhen shall we begin making them? I should like more children.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes were closed, her head back. \u201cMore?\u201d Suddenly, something that Nicholas said came back to her. A son. He\u2019d said he had no children but he\u2019d once had a son. What exactly had he said?</p><p>She pulled her arm from him. \u201cNicholas, do you have a son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, an infant. But you need not worry, his mother died long ago.\u201d</p><p>She was concentrating hard. A son. What had Nicholas said? I had a son, but he died in a fall the week after my brother drowned. \u201cWe have to return,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut we will eat first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She stood up. \u201cWe have to see about your son. You said he died a week after Kit drowned. Tomorrow will be a week. We must go to him now.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas didn\u2019t hesitate. He left a man to pack the food and dishes, while he and the other men and Dougless tore back to the Stafford house. They jumped off their horses at the front gate. Lifting her skirts, Dougless ran after Nicholas.</p><p>He led her to a wing of the house she\u2019d never been in before, then threw open a door. What Dougless saw horrified her more than anything she\u2019d yet seen in the sixteenth century. A little boy, barely over a year old, was wrapped from his neck to his feet in tight bindings of linen\u2014and he was hanging from a peg on the wall. His arms and legs were pinned to him exactly like a mummy. The bottom half of the bindings were filthy where he\u2019d relieved himself but not been changed. Below him on the floor was a wooden bucket to catch excess \u201cdrippings.\u201d</p><p>Dougless could not move as she stared in horror at the child, whose eyes were half open, half closed.</p><p>\u201cThe child is fine,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cNo harm has come to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo harm?\u201d Dougless said under her breath. If a child in the twentieth century were treated like this, it would be taken from its parents, but Nicholas was saying the child was fine. \u201cTake him down,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDown? But he is safe. There is no reason to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dougless glared at him. \u201cDown!\u201d</p><p>With a look of resignation, Nicholas took the boy by the shoulders and, holding him at arms\u2019 length so he\u2019d drip onto the floor and not on his father, he turned to Dougless. \u201cAnd what am I to do with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are going to bathe him and dress him properly. Can he walk? Talk?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas looked astonished. \u201cHow am I to know this?\u201d</p><p>Dougless blinked. There was more than mere time between their two worlds. It took Dougless a while, but she got a big wooden bucket brought to the room and filled with hot water. Nicholas complained and cursed, but he unwrapped his smelly, dirty son and plunked him into the warm water. The poor child was covered with diaper rash from the waist down. Dougless used some of her precious soft soap to gently wash him.</p><p>At one point the boy\u2019s nurse came in and was very upset, saying Dougless was going to kill the child. At first Nicholas wouldn\u2019t get involved\u2014probably because he agreed with the nurse, Dougless thought\u2014but when Dougless glared at him, he made the woman leave.</p><p>The warm water made the boy perk up, and Dougless guessed that the bindings had been so tight the boy had been in a bit of a stupor. She said as much to Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cIt keeps them quiet. Loosen the swaddlings and they weep most loudly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wrap you in bindings like that, hang you on a peg, and see if you don\u2019t cry bloody murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA child has no sense.\u201d Obviously, he was puzzled by her actions and her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHe has the brain now that he\u2019ll go to Yale with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYale?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind. Have safety pins been invented yet?\u201d</p><p>Dougless had to improvise diapers. Nicholas protested when she used one diamond and one emerald brooch to fasten the corners of the boy\u2019s linen diaper. She wished she had some zinc ointment for his rash.</p><p>When at last the child was clean, dry, and powdered (thanks to another hotel giveaway sample from her tote bag), she handed the boy to his father. Nicholas looked horrified and bewildered at the same time, but he took the boy, and after a moment he even smiled at him. The child smiled back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d Dougless asked.</p><p>\u201cJames.\u201d</p><p>She took the boy from Nicholas. He was already a very good looking child, with his father\u2019s dark hair and blue eyes, and he had a tiny cleft in his chin. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you can walk.\u201d She put the boy on the floor, and after a few stumbles, he walked to Dougless\u2019s outstretched arms.</p><p>Nicholas stayed with her, watching as she spent an hour playing with the boy. And when Dougless put him down for the night, she found out more about Elizabethan child care. James\u2019s crib had a hole in the middle, and the child was strapped in at night, his bottom over the hole, and once again a bucket was put under him.</p><p>Nicholas did little more than roll his eyes when she demanded that the child be given a proper mattress. The nurse complained, and Dougless could see her point. If the child had no rubber pants, by morning the mattress would be filthy, and how does one clean goose feathers? She solved the problem by putting a piece of waxed cloth, such as rain gear was made out of, over the mattress. The nurse did as Dougless bid, but she was grumbling when Dougless and Nicholas left.</p><p>Nicholas was chuckling as they left the room. \u201cCome and have supper with me,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will celebrate the cleansing of my son.\u201d Taking Dougless\u2019s hand, he tucked it under his arm.</p><p>THIRTY</p><p>Nicholas leaned back on the bench and watched Dougless playing with his son. The sun was bright, the air heavy with the scent of roses, and as far as Nicholas could tell, all was perfect in the world. It had been three days since she\u2019d taken the boy off the peg and out of swaddling, and during those three days the child had spent a great deal of time with them. But then so had many people spent time with them. Nicholas was amazed to discover how much Dougless had involved herself in in the short time she\u2019d been with the Stafford family. Early mornings she \u201crehearsed,\u201d as she called it, with the fat heiress, and yesterday she and the heiress had put on a ridiculous play while wearing even more ridiculous peasant clothes. They had sung a song about \u201cTravelin\u2019 along, singin\u2019 a song . . . ,\u201d then told jokes that bordered on blasphemy.</p><p>Throughout the play, Nicholas had refused to laugh, because he knew she had done this work for Kit. She had even told Nicholas so. The rest of his family had laughed uproariously at the play, but Nicholas refused to do so.</p><p>Later, when he got her alone, she had laughed at him and accused him of being jealous. Jealous? Nicholas Stafford jealous? He could have any woman he wanted, so why should he be jealous? She had smiled so knowingly that, to stop her, he had grabbed her to him and kissed her until she couldn\u2019t remember her own name, much less think of another man.</p><p>Now, leaning back against the garden wall and watching her toss a ball to his son, he felt at peace. Was this love? he wondered. Was this the love that the troubadours sang of? How could he be in love with a woman he hadn\u2019t taken to bed? Once he\u2019d thought he was in love with a half-gypsy girl who had done splendid things to his body. But with this Dougless all they did was talk\u2014and laugh.</p><p>She had nagged him so much about the sketches she\u2019d found while snooping in his belongings that he had started making new drawings. Kit had told Nicholas that he could begin building Thornwyck Castle in the spring.</p><p>During their days spent together, he and Dougless talked and sang together, rode, and walked. And he found himself telling her things about himself that he had never told another soul.</p><p>Two days ago a portrait painter had come to the Stafford household and Nicholas had commissioned him to paint a miniature oil of Dougless. It should be finished soon.</p><p>Looking at her now, he was beginning to wonder if he could live without her. But, regularly, she mentioned leaving. She talked about what he must do when she was gone. She talked of cleanliness until he could bear no more, but she kept saying cleanliness was of utmost importance.</p><p>When she was gone. He couldn\u2019t bear to think of not being with her. Many times during the day he\u2019d found himself thinking, I must tell Dougless that. She said that in her time men and women were partners and they shared thoughts and ideas. He knew his mother\u2019s last husband had often asked Lady Margaret\u2019s opinion, but he couldn\u2019t remember his stepfather saying, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d as Dougless asked.</p><p>And there was the child. The child was a bother, of course, but there were times when he enjoyed the boy\u2019s smiles. The boy looked up at Nicholas as though his father were a god. Yesterday Nicholas had taken the boy into the saddle before him, and the child\u2019s squeals of laughter had made Nicholas smile.</p><p>Suddenly Dougless laughed at something the boy did and brought Nicholas back to the present. The sunlight was shining on her hair, but then the sunlight seemed to come out only when she was near. He wanted to touch her, hold her, make love to her, but the threat of her disappearance kept him from pulling her into his bed. Oh, he kissed her when he could and touched every part of her body he could reach. They snuggled together in the evenings, alone in some deserted nook, and watched the firelight or the stars out an open window. He touched her and held her, but they went no further. The possibility of her leaving was too great for him to risk.</p><p>A boy came to tell Nicholas that Lady Margaret wanted to see him, so, reluctantly, he left the garden and went into the house.</p><p>His mother awaited him in her private closet off her bedchamber.</p><p>\u201cHave you told her?\u201d Lady Margaret asked, her face stern.</p><p>Nicholas didn\u2019t have to be told what she meant. \u201cNay, I have not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas, this has gone too far. I have been lenient with the woman because she saved Kit\u2019s life, but your behavior . . .\u201d She trailed off because there was no need to say more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nicholas went to the window, opened it, and looked down into the garden. He could just see Dougless below. \u201cI would spend my life with the Montgomery woman,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>Lady Margaret slammed the window shut and glared at her son. She had eyes that could pierce a man. \u201cYou cannot. The dowry for Lettice Culpin has been accepted and part of it spent to buy sheep. The woman brings land with her and a good name. Your children will be related to the throne. You cannot throw that away for this woman who is nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is all to me.\u201d</p><p>Lady Margaret glared at him. \u201cShe is nothing. Two days ago the rider returned from Lanconia. There is no Montgomery king. This Dougless Montgomery is no more than a fast-tongued\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSay no more,\u201d Nicholas said, cutting her off. \u201cI have never believed her to be of royal blood, but she has come to mean more to me than bloodlines and property.\u201d</p><p>Lady Margaret groaned. \u201cDo you think you are the first to love? When I was a girl, I loved my cousin, so I refused to marry your father. My mother beat me until I was willing.\u201d She narrowed her eyes at Nicholas. \u201cAnd she was right. Your father gave me two sons who lived to manhood, while my cousin gambled his fortune away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDougless is not likely to gamble my fortune away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor will she increase your fortune!\u201d Lady Margaret calmed herself. \u201cWhat ails you? Kit is to marry a fat child, while you are to marry one of the great beauties of England. Lettice is much more beautiful than the Montgomery woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I care for money and beauty? Lettice has a heart of stone. She marries me, a younger son, only for my connection to the throne. Let her find another who will overlook her lack of warmth and will see only the perfection of her face.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mean to unkiss this bargain? You will break your betrothal?\u201d Lady Margaret was aghast.</p><p>\u201cHow can I marry one woman when another owns my heart?\u201d</p><p>Lady Margaret gave a derisive snort of laughter. \u201cI did not raise you to be a fool. Keep the Montgomery woman after your marriage. Make her a maid to your wife. I cannot believe Lettice will mind that you do not go to her every night. Get Lettice with child, then go to your Montgomery woman. It was an arrangement my second husband had, and I did not mind. Although he gave his woman three children and me only one and that one died,\u201d she added bitterly.</p><p>Nicholas turned away from his mother. \u201cI do not believe Dougless would agree to such an arrangement. In her country I do not believe such things are done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer country? Where is this country of hers? It is not Lanconia. Where does she get these games and amusements? Where do these strange implements she carries come from? She adds on a machine. She has pills that are magic. Is she from the devil? Do you wish to cohabit with one of the devil\u2019s own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is no witch. She\u2019s from\u2014\u201d He stopped and looked at his mother. He could not tell her the truth about Dougless. Dougless had made a remark about the household loving her now because she had saved Kit, but that it would soon cease.</p> <p>Lady Margaret glared at her son. \u201cDo you sell yourself to her? Do you believe whatever story she tells you? The woman is a liar and . . .\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. \u201cShe interferes too much. She has you drawing houses like a tradesman. She has the girl Kit is to marry dressing like a peasant. She takes children from the nursery. She teaches the servant children to read and write\u2014as though that were needed. She\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have encouraged all of this,\u201d Nicholas said in astonishment. \u201cI was the one who preached caution when she came. You took the tablet she offered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I did. I was much amused by her at first. And I would be amused now were not my youngest son thinking himself in love with her.\u201d Lady Margaret softened and put her hand on Nicholas\u2019s arm. \u201cLove God, love your children when they are grown if you must, but do not give your love to a lying woman. What does she want from you? What does she want from all of us? Listen to me, Nicholas, beware of her. She changes too much in our family. She wants something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nicholas said softly. \u201cShe wants naught but to help. She has been sent\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSent? She has been sent here by whom? Who sent her? What can she gain?\u201d Lady Margaret\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cKit said men tried to pull him under when he nearly drowned. Did the Montgomery woman arrange to have him drowned, then pretend to save him? Such a trick would gain her much in our family. Or mayhap she meant for him to die. Twere Kit dead, you would be earl and she has you in her palm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cHer character is not like that. She did not know about Kit because I had lied to her about the door at Bellwood.\u201d</p><p>Lady Margaret\u2019s handsome face showed her confusion at his words. \u201cWhat do you know of her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaught. I know naught bad of her. You must believe me, the woman wants only good for us. She has no evil intent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why does she want to prevent your marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does not,\u201d Nicholas said, but turned away. When he had first met Dougless, she had said several derogatory things about Lettice, but lately she had said nothing. Nicholas realized his mother\u2019s words were making him doubt Dougless.</p><p>Lady Margaret moved to stand before her son. \u201cDoes the Montgomery woman love you?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cAye, she does,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cThen she will want what is best for you. And Lettice Culpin is best. The Montgomery woman must see that she can bring no dowry to the marriage. She has lied about having an uncle who is king, so I doubt if she has any relative who matters. What is she? The daughter of a tradesman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father teaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Lady Margaret said. \u201cThe truth at last. What can she offer the Stafford family? She has nothing.\u201d She put her hand on Nicholas\u2019s arm. \u201cI do not ask you to give her up. She will stay in this house with you, or go with you and your wife. Breed with the woman. Love her. Make free with her.\u201d Her face became stern again. \u201cBut you cannot make her your wife. Do you understand me? Staffords do not marry the penniless daughters of teachers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand full well, madam,\u201d Nicholas said, eyes dark with anger. \u201cI, more than anyone, feel the weight of my family\u2019s name on my shoulders. I will do my duty and marry the beauteous, coldhearted Lettice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Lady Margaret said, then lowered her voice. \u201cI should hate for something to happen to the Montgomery woman. I have grown fond of her.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stared at his mother for a moment, then turned and left the room. He stalked angrily to his bedchamber, and there, alone, he leaned against the door and closed his eyes. His mother\u2019s words had been clear enough: do your duty and marry Lettice Culpin or \u201csomething\u201d will happen to Dougless. Even as he thought the words, he knew how Dougless would react to his marrying another woman. Dougless would not remain in his household to wait on his wife.</p><p>To lose Dougless and gain Lettice, he thought. To trade Dougless\u2019s eyes of love for Lettice\u2019s cold, calculating eyes. The first time he had met Lettice, he had been taken with her beauty. Dark eyes, dark hair, full red lips. But Nicholas had been around enough beautiful women that he was soon able to see beneath her beauty. She walked about the Stafford household, her eyes on gold vessels, tallying them, her mind like a scale, weighing how much gold the Staffords owned, how much silver.</p><p>Nicholas had tried to seduce the woman, but had failed. He had failed, not because Lettice was unwilling, but because she was uninterested. Kissing Lettice was like kissing warm marble.</p><p>Duty, he thought. His duty was to marry the woman who had more money, the woman with the bluest blood. \u201cDougless,\u201d he whispered, then closed his eyes.</p><p>Tonight he must tell her, he thought. Tonight he had to tell Dougless of his impending marriage. He could put it off no longer.</p><p>THIRTY - ONE</p><p>You can\u2019t marry her,\u201d Dougless said quite calmly.</p><p>\u201cMy love,\u201d Nicholas said, walking toward her, his hands outstretched.</p><p>He had asked her to go riding with him, then had taken her to a neighboring estate where there was a mature maze in the garden. The hedges were twelve feet tall, and the way in and out was complicated. He knew she didn\u2019t know her way out of the maze and therefore she was less likely to run from him when he told her what he had to.</p><p>\u201cI must marry her,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cIt is my duty to my family.\u201d</p><p>Dougless told herself to remain calm. She told herself that she had a job to do, and that she must explain to Nicholas why he couldn\u2019t marry Lettice. But when faced with having the man she loved tell her he was going to marry another, logic fled.</p><p>\u201cDuty?\u201d she said through her teeth. \u201cNo doubt it\u2019s a great hardship for you to marry a beautiful babe like Lettice. I\u2019ll just bet you\u2019re dreading it. And I guess you want me too. Is that it? A wife and a lover? Only I can\u2019t be your lover, can I?\u201d She glared at him. \u201cOr maybe I can be. If I went to bed with you, would that keep you from marrying that evil woman?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas was moving toward her, trying to take her in his arms, but he halted. \u201cEvil? Lettice is greedy perhaps, but evil?\u201d</p><p>Dougless\u2019s fists were clenched at her side. \u201cWhat do you know of evil? You men are all alike no matter when you were born. All you can see is the outside of a person. If a woman is beautiful, she can have any man she wants, no matter how rotten she is inside. And if a woman is ugly, nothing else matters.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas dropped his hands; his eyes were angry. \u201cAye, that is all that interests me. I care naught for duty or family or for the woman I love. Tearing the clothes from Lettice\u2019s divine body is all that interests me.\u201d</p><p>Dougless gasped, feeling as though he\u2019d slapped her. She wanted to leave the maze, but she knew she didn\u2019t know the way out. She turned back to him. Anger was holding her upright, but, quite suddenly, the anger left her. She collapsed on a bench, her face in her hands. \u201cOh, God,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Nicholas sat beside her and pulled her into his arms, holding her while she cried against his chest. \u201cThe marriage is something I must do. It has been arranged. I do not wish it, not now, not since I have you, but it is what I must do. Were something to befall Kit, I would be earl and it is my duty to produce an heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLettice can\u2019t bave chilled,\u201d Dougless said against his chest.</p><p>He pulled a handkerchief from inside his slops. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Dougless blew her nose. \u201cLettice can\u2019t have children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLettice was the one who caused your execution. Oh, Nicholas, please don\u2019t marry her. You can\u2019t marry her. She will kill you.\u201d Dougless was calming somewhat, and beginning to remember what she must tell him. \u201cI was going to tell you, but I thought we would have more time together. I wanted you to trust me more before I told you. I know how much you love Lettice, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove her? I love Lettice Culpin? Who has told you this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. You told me she\u2019s one of the major reasons you wanted to return to the sixteenth century, because you loved her so very much.\u201d</p><p>Pulling away from her, he stood up. \u201cI came to love her?\u201d</p><p>Dougless sniffed and blew her nose again. \u201cWhen you came to me, you\u2019d been married to her for four years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would take more than four years to make me love that woman,\u201d Nicholas muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me more of this love I bore for my wife.\u201d</p><p>There was a knot in Dougless\u2019s throat, so she had difficulty speaking, but she did her best to explain all that he\u2019d said to her. He questioned her thoroughly, asking about their last days together. Dougless held on to one of his big hands with both of hers while she answered his questions.</p><p>At last he put his fingertips under her chin and lifted her face. \u201cWhen I was with you before, I knew I must return. Perhaps I did not want to cause you pain when I left. Perhaps I meant to prevent your loving a man who would not stay.\u201d</p><p>Dougless\u2019s eyes widened, tears sparkling. \u201cYou said that,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOn our last night together, you said you wouldn\u2019t touch me because I\u2019d grieve too much for you.\u201d</p><p>Smiling at her, he smoothed a damp tendril of hair away from her face. \u201cI could not love Lettice were I to live with her a thousand years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Nicholas,\u201d she said, then threw her arms around his neck and began kissing him. \u201cI knew you\u2019d do the right thing. I knew you wouldn\u2019t marry her. Now everything will come out right. You won\u2019t be executed because Lettice won\u2019t have any reason to try to kill you or Kit. And she won\u2019t get hooked up with Robert Sydney because Arabella hasn\u2019t had your baby. Oh, Nicholas, I knew you wouldn\u2019t marry her.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas pulled her arms from around him and held her hands, his eyes locked with hers. \u201cI am pledged to marry Lettice, and I shall leave for the marriage in three days\u2019 time.\u201d When Dougless struggled for release, he held her hands firmly. \u201cMy way is not yours. My time is not the same as yours, and I have not the freedom you have. I cannot marry to suit myself only.\u201d</p><p>He leaned closer to her and put his lips to her cheek. \u201cYou must understand me. My marriage was arranged years ago, and it is a good alliance. My wife will bring property and relatives into the Stafford family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill this property and these relatives help you when the axman removes your head?\u201d she asked angrily. \u201cWill you go to your death thinking how good this marriage was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must tell me all. What you tell me will help me prevent an accusation of treason.\u201d</p><p>She jerked out of his grasp, then walked to the far side of the grassed area at the heart of the maze. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to prevent your execution as well as you could have prevented Kit\u2019s drowning. If I hadn\u2019t been here, your brother would be dead and your lovely Lettice would be marrying an earl.\u201d</p><p>A smile twitched at the corners of Nicholas\u2019s mouth. \u201cWere I the earl, I would not marry Lettice. No doubt my mother would marry me to your fat Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did marry Lettice after you became the earl. Maybe you owed her something and had to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes, the sheep,\u201d Nicholas said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cYou can laugh at me if you want, but I can assure you that when you came to me, you weren\u2019t laughing. Facing an executioner\u2019s ax doesn\u2019t make a person feel jovial.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas sobered. \u201cNay, it would not. You would tell me of Lettice? Tell me all that you know?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dougless sat down on the bench, at the far end from him, away from his touch. As she stared ahead at the green wall of trimmed hedge, she didn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>She started slowly, at the very beginning, telling him of reading Lady Margaret\u2019s papers that were found in a hole in a wall. She told how Nicholas had finagled an invitation into the Harewood\u2019s home, where they\u2019d met Lee and Arabella.</p><p>\u201cWe read the papers and asked questions all weekend, but we found out little. In the end you drew your sword on Lee and he told you that the traitor\u2019s name was Robert Sydney. You and I both thought you\u2019d return to this century after that, but you didn\u2019t. You stayed.\u201d She closed her eyes for a moment. \u201cAfter that, we had a wonderful time together, but then we . . .\u201d The pain of that morning in the church when Nicholas had disappeared was still fresh. \u201cWe made love and the next day you went back. Later I found out you\u2019d been executed.\u201d</p><p>She drew a deep breath and told him more. She told of afterward meeting Lee, and Lee\u2019s telling her of finding Lady Margaret\u2019s account of the truth of what had happened, the truth that became known only after Nicholas\u2019s death.</p> <p>She told how Lettice had planned to marry a Stafford, produce an heir, and put the child on the throne of England. She repeated Lady Margaret\u2019s belief that Lettice had had Kit killed so she\u2019d be marrying an earl instead of a younger son.</p><p>\u201cAfter you married her, she tried to persuade you to raise yourself at court. She wanted to gain as many people to back her as possible, but you refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not like court,\u201d Nicholas said. \u201cToo many people conspire against one another.\u201d</p><p>She turned to look at him. \u201cYou refused to stay at court with your wife, so she tried to kill you. When I met you, you had a long, deep scar on your calf where you had fallen from a horse about a year after your marriage. Your mother wrote that you had many \u2018accidents\u2019 after your marriage.\u201d</p><p>When Nicholas didn\u2019t speak, Dougless continued. She told him that Lettice had begun to look for someone to help rid her of Nicholas and she\u2019d found Robert Sydney. \u201cHe hated you for being his wife\u2019s lover and impregnating her. Lady Margaret thinks he killed both Arabella and the baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut this time I did not impregnate Arabella,\u201d Nicholas said softly.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Dougless said, smiling, then continued. \u201cWhen you started to raise an army to fight in Wales, it was easy for Lettice to get Robert to tell the queen it was treason. Queen Elizabeth was jittery about Mary of Scotland anyway, and maybe she\u2019d heard rumors that the Staffords were considering joining with Mary.\u201d</p><p>Dougless looked at him, at his beautiful face, at his blue eyes. She reached out her hand and put her palm on his soft, dark beard. \u201cThey cut off your head,\u201d she whispered, blinking back tears.</p><p>Nicholas kissed her palm.</p><p>Dougless dropped her hand and looked away. \u201cAfter your . . . death, Robert Sydney blackmailed Lettice into marrying him. He wanted to put his own child on the throne, only the beauteous Lettice, the woman a man had died for, was barren. She could have no children.\u201d</p><p>Dougless grimaced. \u201cLee said it was all ironic. Lettice destroyed the Stafford family for a child she would never have.\u201d</p> <p>There was silence between them for a while.</p><p>\u201cAnd what of my mother?\u201d</p><p>She looked back at him. \u201cThe queen confiscated all that the Staffords owned, and Robert Sydney married her to Dickie Harewood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarewood?!\u201d Nicholas said with disgust.</p><p>\u201cIt was either that or starve to death. The queen gave Sydney a couple of your estates, then someone pushed your mother down a flight of stairs and broke her neck.\u201d</p><p>She paused at Nicholas\u2019s intake of breath. \u201cAfter that there were no more Staffords. Lettice had managed to wipe out all of you.\u201d</p><p>When she turned back to look at him, his face was pale.</p><p>Nicholas got up and walked toward the hedge. He stood in silence for a while, thinking over her words, then turned back to her. \u201cWhat you say could have happened once but could not now.\u201d</p> <p>She understood what he was saying, that now it would be all right to marry Lettice. Anger began to swell her veins. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be such a fool to marry her after what I\u2019ve told you, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your story could not happen now. Arabella does not carry my child, so Robin has no reason to hate me. Kit is alive, so I have no reason to raise an army, and if Kit must raise the army, you will be assured that I will petition the queen\u2019s permission.\u201d</p><p>Dougless came to her feet. \u201cNicholas, don\u2019t you understand that you don\u2019t know the future? When you were in my time, the books said you had died three days before your execution. After you returned, the books told of your execution. History is so very easy to change. If you marry Lettice, when I return will I read that Kit was killed another way? That maybe Lettice came up with another way to have you executed? Maybe she\u2019ll find someone else to help her. I\u2019m sure there are other men with pretty wives who hate you.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas smiled at the last. \u201cA man or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re laughing at me! I am talking life and death, and you stand there laughing at me.\u201d</p><p>He pulled Dougless\u2019s rigid body into his arms. \u201cMy love, it is good that you care so much, and it is good that you have warned me. I will be cautious from now on.\u201d</p><p>She pushed away from him. Her voice and body showed her anger. \u201cYou are thinking like a man,\u201d she accused. \u201cYou think that no woman could ever really do you harm, don\u2019t you? I tell you all of this, and you chuckle at me. Why not wink at me and pat me on the head as well? Why not tell me to go back to my sewing and leave men things, like life and death, to males who are capable of understanding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDougless, please,\u201d he said, reaching out his hands.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you touch me. Save your touches for your lovely Lettice. Tell me, is she so beautiful that she\u2019s worth all the tragedy that she\u2019ll cause? Your death, Kit\u2019s death, your mother\u2019s death, the end of the noble Stafford family?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas let his arms fall to his side. \u201cDo you not see that I have no choice? Am I to tell my family and the Culpins I must break the betrothal because a woman from the future says my bride might kill all of the Staffords? I would be considered a fool and you . . . you would not be treated well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou risk everything because of what people might say?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas searched for a way to explain what must be so that she could understand. \u201cIn your time do you not contract bargains? Legal bargains on paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. We have contracts for everything. We even have marriage contracts but marriages should be made for love, not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy class does not marry for love. We cannot. Look you about. See the wealth of this house? This is but one house my family owns. These riches have come to us because my ancestors married for estate, not for love. My grandfather married a shrew of a woman, but she brought three houses with her and much plate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas, I understand the theory, but marriage is so . . . so intimate. It\u2019s not like signing a contract to do some work for someone. Marriage has to do with love and children, and a home and safety, and having a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you live in poverty with the one you love. Does this love feed you, clothe you, keep you warm in winter? There is more to marriage than what you say. You are poor, so you cannot understand.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes blazed. \u201cFor your information I am not poor. Not by a long shot. My family is very rich. Lots of money. But just because my family has money doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want love, or that I\u2019d sell myself to the highest bidder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did your family obtain its wealth?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve had it forever. My father said that our ancestors married\u2014\u201d She broke off and looked at him with wide eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour ancestors married who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. It was a joke. He didn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Nicholas asked.</p><p>\u201cRich women,\u201d she said angrily. \u201cHe said our ancestors were quite good at marrying rich women.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas said nothing, just stood there looking at her.</p><p>Her anger left her and she went to him, putting her arms about his waist, holding him tightly. \u201cMarry for money,\u201d she said. \u201cMarry the richest woman in the world, but please don\u2019t marry Lettice. She is bad. She\u2019ll hurt you, Nicholas, hurt all of you.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas pushed her out to arm\u2019s length to look into her eyes. \u201cLettice Culpin is the highest I can hope for. I am a younger son, a mere knight. I have naught but what Kit allows me. I am fortunate he is so generous as to allow me to live at his expense. The lands Lettice brings to this family will benefit us all. How can I not do this for a brother who has given me so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLettice isn\u2019t the best you can hope for. Lots of women like you. You can get someone else. If you have to marry someone for money, we\u2019ll find her. Somebody rich but not ambitious like Lettice.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas smiled down at her. \u201cHaving a woman in bed is not the same as a marriage alliance. You must trust me on this. Lettice is a good match for me. No, do not frown. I will be safe. Do you not see? The danger of her is in not knowing. Now that I know, I can save my family and myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she finds out that you aren\u2019t interested in overthrowing the queen or even in going to court, perhaps she will break the engagement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor all that she is related to the Throne and has money, her family is not so old as mine. If what you say about her plans is true, she will not release me. What woman does not believe that she can bend a man to her will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019s going to kill you,\u201d Dougless said. \u201cAre you going to check every saddle cinch to see if it\u2019s been cut? What about poison in your food? What about a wire stretched across the stairs? What if she hires thugs to beat you up? What about drowning? Burning?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled in a patronizing way. \u201cI am pleased you care. You shall help me keep watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d She pulled away from him. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. You shall stay in my household.\u201d He gave her a look through his lashes. \u201cYou shall attend to my wife.\u201d</p><p>It took Dougless a moment to react. \u201cAttend to your wife?\u201d she said evenly. \u201cYou mean like help her dress, check that her bathwater isn\u2019t too hot? That sort of thing?\u201d</p><p>Her calm tone didn\u2019t fool him. \u201cDougless, my love, my one and only love, it will not be so bad. We will spend much time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we spend the time together with or without a permission slip from your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDougless,\u201d he pleaded.</p><p>\u201cYou can ask this of me after the way you talked about my living with Robert? At least with Robert I was his only woman. But you . . . you\u2019re asking me to wait on that . . . that killer! What am I supposed to do at night while you\u2019re trying to produce an heir with her?\u201d</p><p>Nicholas stiffened. \u201cYou cannot ask me to be celibate. You say you cannot share my bed for fear of returning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see, I can be celibate; that\u2019s perfectly okay. But you, Mr. Macho Stud, you have to have a different woman every night. What do you do on the nights when Lettice tells you no? Chase the maids into the arbor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may not speak to me like this,\u201d he said, his eyes darkening with anger.</p><p>\u201cOh, I can\u2019t, can\u2019t I? If someone travels four hundred years just to warn another person, and that person won\u2019t listen for no reason except his own vanity, then the party of the first part can say any damn thing she pleases. Go ahead, marry Lettice, see if I care. Kill Kit. Kill your mother. Lose your estates you think are so bloody valuable. Lose your head!\u201d</p><p>She shouted the last part, then pushed past him and ran through the maze, tears blinding her.</p><p>She was lost within three minutes and she just stood where she was crying. Maybe a person couldn\u2019t change history. Maybe it was predestined that Kit was going to die and Nicholas was going to be executed. Maybe it was never meant that the Stafford family should continue to live. Maybe no one could change what was going to happen.</p><p>Nicholas came to her, but he didn\u2019t speak, and Dougless was glad. She knew that mere words would not change what each felt must be done. Silently, she followed him out of the maze.</p><p>THIRTY - TWO</p><p>For Dougless the next three days were hell. Everyone in the Stafford household was very excited about Nicholas\u2019s forthcoming marriage, and it was all anyone could talk of. The food, the clothes, who would be there, who from the Stafford household would get to go, and who would stay at home with Lady Margaret, were all topics of conversation. Huge carts were packed with the goods Nicholas and Kit would take with them to the Culpin estate, where the wedding would be held. With a feeling of doom, Dougless watched the preparations for the long visit. Nicholas and Kit were taking not only their clothes with them, but furniture and servants as well.</p><p>To Dougless it seemed that every item that was loaded onto the carts was a weight on her heart. She tried to talk to Nicholas. Tried and tried and tried. But he wouldn\u2019t listen. Duty meant more to him than anything else in the world. He would not forsake his duty to his family for any reason on earth, not for love, not even to avoid the possibility of his own death.</p><p>On the night before the day Nicholas was to leave, Dougless felt the worst she ever had. Only the day Nicholas had returned to the sixteenth century and left her in the church was comparable.</p><p>At night, after the maid had helped her undress, she removed her thin, silky slip from her tote bag and put it on. With her borrowed robe about her, she went to Nicholas\u2019s bedchamber.</p><p>Outside his room she put her hand to the door. She knew he was awake; she could feel it. Without knocking, she opened the door. He was sitting up in bed, the rough sheet covering his legs, leaving his chest and hard, flat stomach bare and exposed. He was drinking from a silver tankard, and he didn\u2019t look up when she entered.</p><p>\u201cWe must talk,\u201d she whispered. The room was silent except for the crackle of a fire and the sputter of candles.</p><p>\u201cNay, we have no more to say,\u201d he answered. \u201cWe both must do what we must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d she whispered, but he still didn\u2019t look at her. She slipped the concealing robe from her. The nightgown she wore wasn\u2019t outrageous by twentieth-century standards, but it was when compared to Elizabethan modes of dress. Its thin straps, low neck, and clinging fabric left nothing to the imagination. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She crawled across the bed to him, like a tigress on the stalk. \u201cNicholas,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDo not marry her.\u201d</p><p>When she was near him, he looked at her\u2014and the wine sloshed from his tankard. \u201cWhat do you?\u201d he asked hoarsely, his eyes at first shocked, then hot.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019ll stay with me this night,\u201d she said, drawing nearer to him.</p><p>Nicholas looked down the front of her nightgown, and when he put out a hand to touch her shoulder, his hand trembled.</p> <p>\u201cOne night,\u201d she whispered, moving her face close to his.</p><p>Nicholas reacted instantly. His arms were around her, his lips on hers; he was drinking of her, taking of her, as he\u2019d wanted to do for so long. The fabric of her nightgown tore away as his hands and his lips were on her br**sts, his face buried in them.</p><p>\u201cThis one night for your promise,\u201d Dougless was saying, her head back. She was trying to remember what she had to do before Nicholas\u2019s lips and hands drove all thoughts from her mind. \u201cSwear to me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAll that I have is yours. Do you not know that?\u201d he said, his lips moving lower on her body, down her stomach. His hands were on her hips, his fingers digging into her flesh.</p><p>\u201cThen do not go tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cThis one night for tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>Nicholas\u2019s strong hands were lifting her h*ps up, and the remains of the gown were sliding farther down. \u201cYou may have all my tomorrows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas, please.\u201d Dougless was trying to remember what she meant to say, but Nicholas\u2019s touch was making her unable to think. \u201cPlease, my love. I do not believe I will be here after tonight, so you must swear to me.\u201d</p><p>After a moment Nicholas raised his head and looked up at her, up past her lovely body to her face. His mind was reeling with the sensations of touching this woman who had come to mean so much to him, but he was beginning to hear her. \u201cWhat would you have me swear to you?\u201d he asked in a low voice.</p><p>Dougless lifted her head. \u201cI will spend tonight with you if you\u2019ll swear not to marry Lettice after I\u2019m gone,\u201d she said evenly.</p><p>For a long moment Nicholas looked at her, his bare body poised over her half-nude body, and Dougless held her breath. She had not come to this decision easily, but she knew that, even if it meant losing Nicholas forever, she had to stop this marriage.</p><p>He rolled off of her and the bed in one smooth motion, pulled on a loose robe, then went to stand before the fire, his back to her. When he spoke, his voice was low and husky. \u201cDo you think so little of me to believe I would risk the loss of you for one night\u2019s pleasure? Do you think so little of yourself to sell yourself to me for a promise?\u201d</p> <p>His words were making Dougless feel very small. She pulled her torn gown up over her shoulders. \u201cI couldn\u2019t think of any other way,\u201d she said as an excuse. \u201cI\u2019d do anything to stop your marriage.\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at her, his eyes dark with emotion. \u201cYou have told me of your country and of your ways. Do you think yours is the only way? This marriage means naught to me, yet it means all to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have you risk your life for\u2014\u201d</p><p>His eyes blazed. \u201cYou risk our life for her!\u201d he said angrily. \u201cYou tell me again and again that you cannot come to my bed. Yet you are here now, dressed as a . . . as a . . .\u201d</p><p>Dougless pulled the sheet over her bare shoulders, feeling like a strumpet. \u201cI only meant to try to get you to promise you wouldn\u2019t marry her,\u201d she said, feeling near to tears.</p><p>He went to the bed, looming over her. \u201cWhat love is this you bear for me? You come creeping to my bed, appealing to me like a whore. Only you do not want gold, nay, you want me to dishonor my family, to put aside what means most to me.\u201d</p><p>Dougless put her hands over her face. \u201cDon\u2019t, please. I can\u2019t bear this. I never meant\u2014\u201d</p><p>He sat on the edge of the bed and pulled her hands away. \u201cDo you have any idea how much I dread the morrow? That I dread the woman who I must make my wife? Were I free, were I in your time, I could freely choose where I love. But here and now, I cannot. Were I to marry you, I could not feed you. Kit would no longer give me a place to live, food to eat, clothes to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKit\u2019s not like that. Surely there would be a way for us to live. You help Kit with the estates, so he\u2019d not throw you out. He\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s hands tightened on her wrists. \u201cCan you not hear? Can you not understand? I must make this marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot stop what must be. You can only help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? How can I help you? Can I stop an axman\u2019s blade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can. You can stay by me for always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways? While you live with another woman? Sleep with her? Make love to her?\u201d</p><p>He released her hands. \u201cSo you do this,\u201d he said, looking at her bare shoulders above the sheet. \u201cYou would take yourself from me for all eternity rather than see me with another woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s just that Lettice is evil. I\u2019ve told you what she\u2019ll do. Choose another woman.\u201d</p><p>He gave a smile that had no mirth in it. \u201cYou would allow me another wife? Allow me to touch another woman when I cannot touch you? You are willing to stand to one side for the rest of our lives?\u201d</p><p>Dougless swallowed. Could she live in the same house with him while he lived with another woman? What would she do, be a maiden aunt to Nicholas\u2019s children? How would she feel when, each night, he went off to bed with another woman? And how long would he continue to love her if he couldn\u2019t touch her? Were either of them strong enough for a platonic love?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could stand by and see you with another woman. Nicholas, oh Nicholas, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the bed beside her and gathered her into his arms. \u201cI will not risk losing you for a hundred women like Lettice. You are worth all to me. God has sent you to me, and I mean to hold you.\u201d</p><p>She put her head on his chest, parting the robe so her cheek was on his skin. In spite of herself, tears came to her eyes. \u201cI am frightened. Lettice is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mere woman. No more, no less. She possesses no great wisdom, no amulets of power. If you are by me, she can do me or my family no harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy you?\u201d Her hand went under his robe, touching his skin. \u201cCan I stay by you and not touch you?\u201d</p><p>He moved her roaming fingers from inside his robe. \u201cYou are sure you will return if I . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d she answered firmly. \u201cAt least I think I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>He held her fingers up and looked at them as a starving man might look at a feast. \u201cIt would be much to lose were we to try, would it not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, sadly. \u201cMuch, much too much.\u201d</p><p>He dropped her hand. \u201cYou must go. I am a man, and you tempt me more than I can bear.\u201d</p><p>Dougless knew she should go, but she hesitated. Once again she put her hand on Nicholas\u2019s skin.</p><p>\u201cGo!\u201d he commanded.</p><p>Quickly, she rolled away from him, then ran from the room. She went back to Honoria\u2019s room and slipped into bed, but she didn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>Tomorrow the man she loved, no, more than loved, the man who meant so much that even time could not separate them, was leaving to marry another woman. What was she to do when Nicholas returned with his beautiful wife? (Dougless had heard so much of Lettice\u2019s beauty that she would have hated the woman even if she knew nothing else about her.) Should she curtsy and congratulate her? Something like, \u201cHope you enjoy him. And I certainly hope he\u2019s as good a lover with you as he was with me.\u201d</p><p>Dougless had a vision of Nicholas and his pretty wife laughing together over some private joke. She saw Nicholas sweeping Lettice into his arms and carrying her off to the room they shared. Would they put their heads together over meals and smile at each other?</p><p>Dougless slammed her fist into the pillow, making Honoria stir. Men were such fools. They never saw past a pretty face. When a man asked about a woman, all he wanted to know was, was she pretty? No man ever asked if a woman had morals, whether she was honest, kind, did she like children or not? Dougless imagined a beautiful Lettice torturing a puppy in front of Nicholas, but Nicholas not noticing because dear, luscious Lettice had looked at him through fluttering lashes.</p><p>\u201cMen!\u201d Dougless muttered, but even as she said it, she didn\u2019t mean it. Nicholas had not allowed himself to be seduced tonight because he was afraid he\u2019d lose Dougless. If that wasn\u2019t love, what was?</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was saving himself for Lettice,\u201d Dougless said into the pillow, and that\u2019s when she began to cry.</p><p>The sun came up and still Dougless cried. It was as though she couldn\u2019t stop. Honoria did everything she could to cheer Dougless up, but nothing worked.</p><p>Dougless could see, hear, think of nothing but Nicholas and the beautiful woman he was to marry. When Dougless thought of the hideous non-choices she had, she began to cry harder. She could stay in the sixteenth century and watch Nicholas with his wife, watch them talking together, watch while Lettice was given an honored place in the family as a son\u2019s wife. Or she could threaten Nicholas that he had to give up his wife or she, Dougless, would leave the house. And if she left the Stafford household, what would she do? How could she earn her living in the sixteenth century? Drive a taxi? Maybe become an executive secretary? She was rather good with computers. She\u2019d been in the Elizabethan age long enough to see how well a lone woman would fare without a man. She couldn\u2019t so much as go two miles from the house without fear of being set upon by thieves.</p><p>And even if she could leave him, that would mean he\u2019d be left in the hands of the scheming Lettice.</p><p>So what could she do if she couldn\u2019t leave and she couldn\u2019t stay? She could work harder at seducing Nicholas; then, after one lovely night of passion, she would be returned to the twentieth century. Without Nicholas. Alone. Never to see him again. She imagined herself at home in Maine, sitting by herself and thinking that she would give all she possessed to see Nicholas, to speak to him just one more time. By that time, she\u2019d be so lonely she wouldn\u2019t care if he were with a hundred women, if she could just see him one more time.</p><p>\u201cWomen\u2019s lib doesn\u2019t cover this situation,\u201d she said through her tears. The ideal of equality for women said you weren\u2019t supposed to put up with the man in your life having affairs, so she guessed she certainly wasn\u2019t supposed to let him marry someone else.</p><p>It was all or nothing. To have Nicholas she had to share him; she\u2019d have to share him physically, mentally, share him in every way possible. To leave him meant absolute, eternal loneliness for Dougless, and possibly death for Nicholas and his family.</p><p>Every thought made her cry harder. Days went by and still she cried. Honoria made sure that Dougless was dressed each day and she tried to see that she ate, but Dougless couldn\u2019t eat. She didn\u2019t care about eating or sleeping. Her mind was on Nicholas.</p><p>At first the other people in the Stafford household were sympathetic to Dougless\u2019s tears. They knew why she cried. They had seen the way she and Nicholas looked at each other, the way they touched. Some of them sighed and remembered their first loves. They felt sorry for Dougless when Nicholas went off to be married, and they saw the way Dougless cried in heart-broken grief. But their sympathy wore thin when Dougless\u2019s tears went on day after day after day. They became so annoyed that they began to ask themselves what use the woman was. Lady Margaret had given Dougless everything, but now Dougless was giving nothing in return. Where were the new games, the new songs the woman should be providing?</p><p>On the fourth day, Lady Margaret called Dougless to her.</p><p>Dougless, weak from fasting and endless tears, stood before Lady Margaret, her head down, her cheeks wet, her face swollen and red.</p><p>Lady Margaret was silent for a moment as she looked at Dougless\u2019s bent head and heard the soft weeping. \u201cCease!\u201d Lady Margaret commanded. \u201cI am most tired of your tears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Dougless said, hiccuping. \u201cI can\u2019t seem to stop.\u201d</p><p>Lady Margaret grimaced. \u201cHave you no spine? My son was a fool to believe himself to love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. I\u2019m not worthy of him.\u201d</p><p>Sitting down, Lady Margaret contemplated Dougless\u2019s bent head. She knew her younger son well enough to know that this woman\u2019s tears would wrench his too-soft heart. Before he left, Nicholas was saying he could not do his duty and marry the Culpin woman. How would their marriage fare if he returned and found this strange red-haired wench crying for love of him? Lady Margaret had always been able to reason with Kit, but Nicholas, like his father, had a stubborn streak. She did not think Nicholas would do it, but what if he returned, saw the red-eyed face of this Dougless, and attempted to set his marriage aside?</p><p>Lady Margaret continued to look at the bent head before her. The woman must go from this house. Yet why did she hesitate in sending her away? For that matter, why had she allowed this woman into the Stafford house? At first Nicholas had been enraged that his mother had so trusted the oddly dressed, oddly spoken young woman enough to take an unknown tablet from her. Yet Lady Margaret had taken one look at the woman\u2019s face and she had trusted her. Trusted her with her life.</p><p>Nicholas had been so angry after that. Lady Margaret smiled in memory. Nicholas had locked the girl in a filthy cell at the top of the house, and she\u2019d stayed up there, eaten by fleas, while Lady Margaret had argued with her son over the girl\u2019s fate. Nicholas had wanted to toss her into the road, and, in truth, Lady Margaret had known he was right. But something prevented her, something inside her, made her refuse to thrown the girl out.</p><p>It was Nicholas who had gone to get the girl. He had been \u201ctrying to reason\u201d with his mother (\u201creason\u201d is what he called his stubborn insistence that he was right) when, abruptly, he got up, left the room, and went to fetch the girl.</p><p>Lady Margaret smiled more broadly when she thought of the girl\u2019s absurd story of being a princess from far off Lanconia. Lady Margaret hadn\u2019t believed her for a moment, but the foolish story had given her a reason for keeping the girl near her, against Nicholas\u2019s strenuous protests.</p><p>Those first days had been divine. The girl was lively and entertaining beyond all reasoning. Even her speech was amusing. And her actions never failed to delight, puzzle, and fascinate. The girl was stupid about so many things, such as dressing and even eating, yet she was very clever about some things. She knew more about medicine than any physician. She told curious stories about the moon and the stars and the earth being round. She had devised a short, wide chair that was stuffed with down and had fabric nailed over it. She called it an \u201ceasy chair\u201d and had given it to Lady Margaret. She didn\u2019t know it, but she had half the household rising early to hide in the gardens to watch her bathing in the fountain, using a marvelous foam on her hair and skin. In private Lady Margaret had inspected the wonders in her bag, had even used the little brush and something called toothpaste. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, the girl was entertaining, all right. At one point, Lady Margaret had hoped she would never leave.</p><p>But then Nicholas had fallen in love with her. Lady Margaret had not at first cared. Young men often fell in love. At sixteen Kit had been in love with one of her ladies-in-waiting. Lady Margaret saw that the woman took Kit to bed and taught him a thing or two; then she\u2019d sent Kit to the kitchens, where she knew a voluptuous servant girl was working. Within a week Kit had been \u201cin love\u201d with the serving wench.</p><p>Lady Margaret had had no such troubles with Nicholas. Nicholas had never needed an introduction to women. Over the years he had given his body freely, but never his heart.</p><p>She should have known that when Nicholas did give his heart, he would give it so completely that a hundred voluptuous serving girls would not be able to take it back. At first Lady Margaret had been glad when Nicholas had shown such extraordinary interest in this Dougless Montgomery. Lady Margaret had thought that when Nicholas returned with his bride, since Dougless loved him, the red-haired woman would not be tempted to leave the Stafford household. Lady Margaret would miss the girl\u2019s humor and knowledge if she were gone.</p> <p>But as the days progressed, Lady Margaret refused to see just how attached Nicholas was becoming to her. When at last Lady Margaret had really looked at her household, what she saw did not please her. Her youngest son loved the woman to the point of obsession. Her eldest son spoke of giving the girl great riches, and Kit\u2019s future wife talked of little else except what Dougless said or did.</p><p>As did the rest of the household. \u201cDougless says children should not be swaddled.\u201d \u201cDougless says the wound must be washed.\u201d \u201cDougless says my husband had no right to beat me.\u201d \u201cDougless says a woman should have control of her own money.\u201d Dougless says, Dougless says, Lady Margaret thought. Who ran the Stafford household? Did the Staffords or this girl who lied about her relatives?</p><p>And now she stood before Lady Margaret weeping, weeping as she had done for days. Lady Margaret clenched her teeth when she thought of how the tears of this one woman were affecting everyone.</p><p>But worse, she knew that these tears would affect Nicholas. Nicholas who said he loved her, Nicholas who talked of breaking a betrothal because of this woman who had nothing, who was nothing. Yet this woman, to whom Lady Margaret had given so much, now threatened everything in her family. Were Nicholas to disavow his contract with the Culpin family . . . No, she did not like to think what could happen.</p><p>The red-haired woman must go.</p> <p>Lady Margaret\u2019s mouth set into a firm, hard line. \u201cThe runner has come from Lanconia. You are no princess. You are related to no one in the royal house. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ-just a woman. No one special,\u201d Dougless said, sniffing.</p><p>\u201cWe have given you all that our house has to offer, yet you have lied to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have.\u201d Dougless kept her head down, agreeing with everything. There was nothing anyone could say to her to make her feel worse. The marriage was to take place this morning. Today Nicholas would marry his beautiful Lettice.</p><p>Lady Margaret took a breath. \u201cOn the morrow you will leave us. You will take what clothes you came in, no more, and you will be sent forever from the Stafford house.\u201d</p><p>It took a moment for Dougless to understand. She looked at Lady Margaret, blinking at her through tear-filled eyes. \u201cLeave? But Nicholas wishes me to stay, to be here when he returns.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think his wife will wish to see you? My foolish son has grown too attached to you. You do him harm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never harm Nicholas. I came here to save him, not to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>Lady Margaret glared at her. \u201cFrom whence do you come? Where did you live before you came here?\u201d</p><p>Dougless clamped her mouth shut. She could say nothing, absolutely nothing. If she told Lady Margaret the truth, Dougless\u2019s life would be worth nothing, and there would never be a chance of her seeing Nicholas again. \u201cI . . . I will provide entertainments,\u201d Dougless said, her voice desperate. \u201cI know more songs, more games. And I can tell you many more stories about America. I could tell you about airplanes and automobiles and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lady Margaret put up her hand. \u201cI weary of your amusements. I cannot feed and clothe you. Who are you? A peasant\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father teaches, and I teach too. Lady Margaret, you can\u2019t throw me out. I have nowhere to go, and Nicholas needs me. I have to protect him as I protected Kit. I saved Kit\u2019s life, remember? He offered me a house then. I\u2019ll take it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked for your reward and received it. Due to you, my son works as a tradesman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Dougless put out her hands, pleading.</p> <p>\u201cYou will go. We harbor no liars here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wash dishes,\u201d Dougless said, pleading. \u201cI\u2019ll be the family physician. I can\u2019t do worse than the leeches. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will leave!\u201d Lady Margaret half shouted, her eyes glistening like precious stones. \u201cI will have you no longer in my house. My son asked to be released from his betrothal for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did?\u201d Dougless almost smiled. \u201cHe never told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou disarray my household. You bewitch my son till he does not know his duty. Be you glad I do not have a whip taken to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is better? Sending me out there, into those . . . those people? Sending me away from Nicholas?\u201d</p><p>Lady Margaret stood up, then turned her back on Dougless. \u201cI will not argue with you. Say your farewells this day, and on the morrow you will be sent from my house. Now go. I do not wish to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Numbly, Dougless turned and left the room. Not seeing anything, she made her way back to Honoria\u2019s room. Honoria took one look at her face and guessed what was wrong.</p><p>\u201cLady Margaret has sent you away?\u201d Honoria whispered.</p><p>Dougless nodded.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a place to go? One who will take care of you?\u201d</p><p>Dougless shook her head. \u201cI will be leaving Nicholas to that evil woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Lettice?\u201d Honoria asked, puzzled. \u201cThe woman is cool perhaps, but I do not believe she is evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a great deal about her. I know what she\u2019s going to do.\u201d</p><p>Honoria had learned to ignore these odd remarks of Dougless\u2019s. She thought perhaps that she didn\u2019t want to know all there was to know about Dougless. \u201cWhere will you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have relatives?\u201d</p><p>Dougless gave a weak smile. \u201cProbably. I imagine there are some sixteenth-century Montgomerys about somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do not know them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only know Nicholas.\u201d Nicholas who was by now, no doubt, married. She had thought she had choices, that she could choose to stay or go, but now it looked as though her fate had been decided for her. \u201cI know Nicholas, and I know what will happen,\u201d she said tiredly.</p><p>\u201cYou shall go to my family,\u201d Honoria said firmly. \u201cThey will love your games and songs. They will care for you.\u201d</p><p>Dougless managed a bit of a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you, but if I can\u2019t stay with Nicholas, I don\u2019t want to stay here at all.\u201d</p><p>Honoria\u2019s face whitened. \u201cSuicide is against God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d Dougless whispered and tears came to her eyes. \u201cGod did this to me, and now it\u2019s all going wrong.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, eyes closed. \u201cPlease, Nicholas, don\u2019t marry her. I beg you, please.\u201d</p><p>Concerned, Honoria went to Dougless and felt her forehead. \u201cYou are warm. This day you must remain in bed. You are ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am past ill,\u201d Dougless said as she allowed Honoria to push her down on the bed. She barely felt Honoria\u2019s hands unfastening the front of her dress as she closed her eyes.</p><p>Hours later she opened her eyes to see a darkened room. She was in Honoria\u2019s bed wearing only her linen gown, her hair down. Her pillow was wet, so she knew she had been crying while she slept.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d she whispered. Married now. Married to the woman who would kill him, who would eventually kill all the Staffords. Dougless closed her eyes again. When she awoke next it was night outside and the room was very dark. Honoria was asleep beside her.</p><p>Something is wrong, Dougless thought. Very wrong. She remembered Lady Margaret telling her that she must leave the Stafford family, but there was something else.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNicholas needs me.\u201d</p><p>She got out of bed and went into the hall. All was quiet. Barefoot, she went down the stairs, her feet moving about under the dried river rushes on the floor. She went out the back toward the garden, following where instinct and some indefinable pull led her.</p><p>She went across the brick terrace, down the stairs, along the raised walk, then turned into the knot garden. There was only a quarter moon, so it was very dark, but she didn\u2019t need to see, for she had an inner sight.</p><p>As she approached the garden, she heard the fountain splashing, the fountain where she had showered each morning until Nicholas left. She had not been outside since Nicholas rode away.</p><p>There, standing in the fountain, his body nude, covered in soap lather, was Nicholas.</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t think, and certainly used no reason. One minute she was outside the fountain, and the next she was in Nicholas\u2019s wet arms, holding him, kissing him with all the desperation and fear that she felt.</p><p>Everything happened too suddenly for her to stop and think. She was in his arms; they were on the ground; she was nude. They came together with a clash of pent-up desire that made Dougless cry out. Nicholas, not gently, no, not gentle at all, bent her body backward over a stone bench and rammed into her with blinding force. Dougless held on to his shoulders, her nails digging into his skin, put her legs about his waist, and held on.</p><p>Fast, furious, frantic, they tore at each other. Their bodies, covered with sweat, stuck together as they rose and fell together, again, again, again.</p><p>When at last they finished, Nicholas put his strong hands under her and lifted her to meet his final deep, deep thrust. Dougless cried out as the world darkened and her body stiffened as she found release.</p><p>It was a while before she recovered herself and could see again, think again. Nicholas was grinning at her, his teeth white. Even in the darkness she could see his happiness.</p><p>But Dougless was beginning to think. \u201cWhat have we done?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Nicholas unwrapped her legs from his body and pulled her to stand before him. \u201cWe have just begun.\u201d</p><p>She was blinking at him, trying to make her mind work, because her body was trembling at the touch of him. The tips of her br**sts were touching his chest and they were tingling. \u201cWhy are you here? Oh, God, Nicholas, what have we done?\u201d She started to sit on the bench, but he pulled her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cLater there will be time for words,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I will do what I have much wanted to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said as she pushed away from him. She was fumbling about for the remnants of her gown. \u201cWe have to talk now. There will be no time later. Nicholas!\u201d Her voice was rising. \u201cWe will have no more time!\u201d</p><p>He pulled her back into his arms. \u201cYou do still insist you will disappear? Here, look you, we have tasted\u2014merely tasted\u2014of one another, yet you do remain.\u201d</p><p>How could she tell him? She collapsed on the bench, her head down. \u201cI knew you were here. I felt you. And just as I knew you needed me, I know that this is our last night together.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas didn\u2019t speak, but after a moment he sat down on the bench beside her, very close, but their nude bodies were not touching. \u201cI have always felt you,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThis night you heard my call, but it has always been so with me. After I left I . . .\u201d He paused. \u201cI felt your tears. I could hear nothing but your weeping. I could not see Lettice for seeing you in your tears.\u201d</p><p>Putting out his hand, he took hers. \u201cI left the woman. I said naught, not even to Kit. I took my horse and rode. When I should have been saying vows, I was riding to you. It took until now to reach you.\u201d</p><p>This is what she had wanted, but now that it was here, the enormity of what he\u2019d done scared her. She looked at him. \u201cWhat will happen now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be . . . anger,\u201d he said, \u201canger on both sides. Kit . . . My mother will . . .\u201d He looked away.</p><p>Dougless could see how torn he was between duty and love. But now she wouldn\u2019t be here to help him. She squeezed his hand. \u201cYou will not marry her even after I\u2019m gone?\u201d</p><p>He turned blazing eyes toward her. \u201cYou would leave me now?\u201d</p><p>Tears came again to her eyes as she flung herself against him. \u201cI would never leave you if I had a choice, but I don\u2019t. Not now. Now there is no choice. I will go soon, I know it. I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her, then smoothed her hair back. \u201cHow much time?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cDawn. No more. Nicholas, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He silenced her with a kiss. \u201cI would rather hours with you than a lifetime with another. Now, no more talk. Come, we will love away these hours.\u201d</p><p>He stood up, then pulled her up beside him and led her into the still-running fountain, where he began to lather her with the last of her soft soap. \u201cYou left this behind,\u201d he said, smiling at her.</p><p>Forget that this is the end, Dougless thought. Forget it. Time must stand still for this one night. \u201cHow did you kn-know I showered here?\u201d she asked, her voice stumbling.</p><p>\u201cI was one of those who watched.\u201d</p><p>She stopped soaping herself, and Nicholas\u2019s hands stilled at her look. \u201cWatched? Who watched me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cDid you not notice the men\u2019s yawns? They rose most early to hide themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHide!\u201d Her anger was rising. \u201cAnd you were one of them? You allowed this? You let men spy on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere I to have stopped you, I would have halted my own pleasure. It was a dilemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDilemma! Why, you\u2014!\u201d She lunged at him.</p><p>Nicholas sidestepped, then caught her, pulling her close to him. He forgot about soaping her as he bent his head and began kissing her br**sts, the water pouring down on top of them. \u201cI have dreamed of this,\u201d he said, \u201csince my vision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shower,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThe shower.\u201d Her hands were entangled in his hair as his mouth moved lower and lower. He was on his knees before her. \u201cNicholas, my Nicholas.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They made love again, as they had done before, in the water. For Nicholas it was a discovery of her body, but for Dougless, she had had weeks of remembering and wanting. Her hands were all over him, memorizing, remembering, finding new places she had not touched or tasted before.</p><p>By the time they finished, it was hours later. The water had stopped flowing, and Dougless guessed that whoever was turning the wheel was too tired to continue. She and Nicholas lay in each other\u2019s arms on the sweet grass.</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk,\u201d she said at last.</p><p>\u201cNay, do not.\u201d</p> <p>She snuggled closer to him. \u201cI must. I wish with all my heart that I didn\u2019t have to speak, but I must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the morrow, when the sun touches your hair, you will laugh at this. You are no woman from the future. You are here with me now. You will remain with me for all time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish . . .\u201d Her voice grew hoarse and she swallowed. Her hand was roaming over his body, touching him. The last time. The last time. \u201cNicholas, please,\u201d she said. \u201cListen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I will listen, then I will love you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you left before, no one remembered you. It was as though you hadn\u2019t existed. It was so horrible for me.\u201d She buried her face in his shoulder. \u201cYou had come and gone, but no one remembered. It was as though I\u2019d made you up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am most forgettable.\u201d</p><p>She raised on her elbow to look at him, to touch his beard, his cheek, to caress his eyebrows, to kiss his eyelids. \u201cI will never forget you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor I, you.\u201d He lifted a bit to kiss her lips, but when he wanted more, Dougless pulled away.</p><p>\u201cThe same may happen when I leave. I want you to be prepared if no one remembers me. Don\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t know what to say . . . Don\u2019t make yourself crazy trying to make them remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey probably will. What if the songs I taught you were remembered? It could ruin some very good Broadway shows in the twentieth century.\u201d She tried to smile but didn\u2019t quite make it. \u201cI want you to swear some things to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will not marry Lettice. I doubt now I will be asked again,\u201d he said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cGood. Oh, very, very good. Now I won\u2019t have to read about your execution.\u201d She ran her fingertips over his neck. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll take care of James. No more swaddling, and play with him sometimes.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her fingertips and nodded.</p><p>\u201cTake care of Honoria; she\u2019s been so good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will find her the best of husbands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the richest, the best. Promise?\u201d When he nodded, she went on. \u201cAnd anyone who\u2019s delivering a baby has to wash his or her hands first. And you have to build Thornwyck Castle and leave records behind that show that you designed it. I want history to know.\u201d</p><p>He was smiling at her. \u201cNaught else? You will have to remain by my side to remind me of all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI would, but I cannot. May I have the miniature of you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou may have my heart, my soul, my life.\u201d</p><p>She clasped his head in her arms. \u201cNicholas, I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is naught bad to bear,\u201d he said, kissing her arm, her shoulder, his lips traveling downward. \u201cPerhaps Kit will give me a small estate, and we\u2014\u201d</p><p>She pulled away to look at him. \u201cWrap the miniature of you in oiled cloth, something that will protect it over the next four hundred years, and put it behind the . . . What\u2019s the stone thing that holds up the beams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA corbel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Thornwyck Castle you\u2019ll make a corbel that\u2019s a portrait of Kit. Wrap the miniature and put it behind the corbel. When I . . . when I return, I\u2019ll go get it.\u201d</p><p>He was kissing her breast.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard all. James. Honoria. Midwives. Thornwyck. Kit\u2019s face.\u201d With each word, he punctuated it with a little sucking-kiss on her breast. \u201cNow, my love,\u201d he whispered, \u201ccome to me.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her body and set her down on top of him, and Dougless forgot everything on earth except the touch of this man she loved so much. He stroked her hips, her br**sts as they moved together. Up and down. Slowly at first, then building faster.</p><p>Nicholas rolled with her until she was on her back, and his passion rose as he entered her deeply, her body rising to meet his. They arched together, both with their heads back, then they collapsed, Nicholas on top of her, holding her very tightly.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI will love you for all time.\u201d</p><p>Dougless clung to him, holding him as tightly as she could. \u201cYou will remember me? You won\u2019t forget me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he said. \u201cNever will I forget you. Were I to die tomorrow, my soul would remember you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t speak of death. Speak only of life. With you I am alive. With you I am whole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I with you.\u201d He rolled to one side and pulled her close to him. \u201cLook, you. The sun comes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicholas, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her damp hair. \u201cAfraid of being seen unclad? It is not something we have not seen before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou!\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019ll never forgive you for not telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will have a lifetime in which to make you forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYes. It will take a lifetime.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the lightening sky. \u201cWe must go. I must tell my mother what I have done. Kit will no doubt be here soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will be very angry. And my part in this won\u2019t help matters any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must go to Kit with me. I will be shameless. I will tell my brother he must give us a place to live in memory of your saving him.\u201d</p><p>Dougless looked up at the sky, saw it was growing lighter by the minute. She could almost believe she was going to be able to stay with him. \u201cWe\u2019ll live in a pretty little house somewhere,\u201d she said, her words beginning to gain speed. \u201cWe\u2019ll have only a few servants, fifty or so,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll have a dozen kids. I like kids. And we\u2019ll educate them properly and teach them how to wash. Maybe we can invent a flush toilet.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas chuckled. \u201cYou wash too much. My sons will not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur sons. I\u2019m going to have to explain to you about women\u2019s equality.\u201d</p><p>He stood up, then pulled her into his arms. \u201cWill this explaining take long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout four hundred years,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThen I will give you the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cTime. We will have all the time we need.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her then, kissed her long and hard and deeply; then his kiss lightened. \u201cForever,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI will love you throughout time.\u201d</p><p>One moment Dougless was in his arms, his lips on hers, and the next she was in the church at Ashburton, and outside a jet flew overhead.</p><p>THIRTY - THREE</p><p>Dougless didn\u2019t cry. What she was feeling was too deep, too profound for her to cry. She was sitting on the floor in the little church in Ashburton, and she knew that behind her was Nicholas\u2019s marble tomb. She couldn\u2019t bear to look at it, couldn\u2019t bear to see the warm flesh of Nicholas translated into cold marble.</p><p>She sat where she was for a while and looked at the church. It looked so old and so plain. There was no color on the beams or on the walls, and the stone floors looked bare with no rushes on them. In the first pews were some needlepointed pillows, and now they looked crude. She was used to seeing Lady Margaret\u2019s women\u2019s exquisite needlework.</p><p>When the door of the church opened and the vicar came in, Dougless sat where she was.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d the vicar asked.</p><p>At first Dougless couldn\u2019t understand him. His accent and his pronunciation were foreign sounding. \u201cHow long have I been here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The vicar frowned. This young woman was so very strange. She walked in front of speeding vehicles, she insisted she was with a man when she was alone, and now she had just walked into the church and was asking how long she had been here. \u201cA few minutes, no more,\u201d he answered.</p><p>Dougless gave a weak smile. A few minutes. A lifetime in the sixteenth century and she had been away only a few minutes. When she tried to stand, her legs were weak and the vicar helped her rise.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should see a doctor,\u201d the vicar said.</p><p>A psychiatrist perhaps, Dougless almost answered. If she told her story to a psychiatrist, would he write a book and make what happened to Dougless into a Movie-of-the-Week? \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine, really,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI just need to get back to my hotel and\u2014\u201d And what? What was there for her to do now that Nicholas was gone? She took a step forward.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget your bag.\u201d</p><p>Dougless turned to see her old tote bag on the floor by the tomb. The contents of that bag had helped her throughout her time in the Elizabethan age. Looking at it, she felt a closeness to the bag. It had been where she had been. She went to it and on impulse unzipped the top of it. She didn\u2019t have to inspect the contents to know that everything was there. The bottle of aspirin was full; none of the pills she had given away were missing. Her toothpaste tube was full, not flat. No cold tablets were missing, no pages gone from her notebook. Everything was as it had been.</p><p>She lifted the tote bag, slung the strap onto her shoulder, then turned away. But abruptly, she halted; then she turned and glanced back at the base of the tomb. Something was different. She wasn\u2019t at first sure what it was, but something had changed.</p><p>Careful not to look at the sculpture of Nicholas, she stared at the base.</p><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d the vicar asked.</p><p>Dougless read the inscription twice before she realized what was different. \u201cThe date,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe date? Ah, yes, the tomb is quite old.\u201d</p><p>Nicholas\u2019s death date was 1599. Not 1564. Bending, she touched the numbers, trying to make sure she was seeing correctly. Thirty-five years. He had lived thirty-five years past when he was supposed to have been executed.</p><p>It was only after she had touched the date that she looked up at the tomb. The sculpture was of Nicholas, but it was very different now. It was not a portrait of a young man, dead in his prime, but of an older man, a man who had been able to live out his life. She looked down the length of him, saw that his clothes were different. He wore the longer knee breeches of 1599, instead of the short slops of thirty years earlier.</p><p>She caressed his cold cheek, traced the lines the sculptor had put at the corners of his eyes. \u201cWe did it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNicholas, my love, we did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d the vicar said.</p><p>When Dougless looked at him, she gave him a dazzling smile. \u201cWe changed history,\u201d she said; then, still smiling, she walked outside into the sunshine.</p><p>She stood in the graveyard for a moment, feeling disoriented. The gravestones were so old, yet an hour before stones with these dates had been new. Dougless gasped in horror at the first sight of a car. And as she gasped, she felt her lungs expand; no steel corset confined her ribcage. For a moment she had a deep sense of everything being wrong. She felt na**d and drab in her plain clothes. She looked down at her boring skirt and blouse with distaste. And her back felt as though it had nothing to support it now that her corset was gone, and her leather boots pinched her feet.</p><p>Another car went by, and the speed of it made Dougless feel dizzy. She walked to the gate, opened it, then stepped onto the sidewalk. How odd to have concrete under her feet. As she walked, she looked with awe at the buildings about her. There were huge expanses of glass; the shop signs had writing on them. Who can read them? she thought, remembering that where she had been few people could read, so signs were painted with pictures of what was sold in the shops.</p><p>How clean everything was, she thought. No mud, no chamber pot emptyings, no kitchen slops, no pigs foraging. The people in the street were odd-looking too. They all wore the same drab clothes as she did. And they all seemed to be equal, no beggars dressed in filthy rags, no ladies with pearls on their skirts.</p><p>Dougless slowly walked down the street, staring wide-eyed, as though she\u2019d never seen the twentieth century before. The smell of food made her turn and enter a pub. For a moment she stood in the doorway and looked about. Obviously, the place was supposed to be a facsimile of an Elizabethan tavern, but it missed by a long way. It was too clean, too quiet, too . . . lonely, she thought. The people sitting at the tables were isolated from one another. Not at all like the gregarious, nosy Elizabethans.</p><p>At the back of the pub was a chalkboard with the menu on it. Dougless ordered six courses, taking no notice of the waitress\u2019s raised eyebrows; then she went to a table to sit down and sip her beer. The thick glass mug felt odd and the beer tasted as though it were half water.</p><p>On the bar was a rack of guidebooks to the historic houses of Great Britain. Dougless handed the barman a ten-pound note, then took the book back to her booth and began to read it. Bellwood was open to the public, just as it had been before. She looked for Nicholas\u2019s other houses and found that they were no longer listed as being ruins. All eleven of the houses Nicholas had once owned were still standing. And three of them were owned by the Stafford family.</p><p>Dougless blinked hard as she reread the passage. The guidebook said that the Stafford family was one of the oldest and wealthiest in England, that in the seventeenth century they had married into the royal family, and that the present duke was a cousin to the queen.</p><p>\u201cDuke,\u201d Dougless whispered. \u201cNicholas, your descendants are dukes.\u201d</p><p>When the food came, Dougless was a bit startled at the way it was served, without ceremony, all the dishes being put on the table at once.</p><p>As she ate, she kept reading the guidebook. Except for Bellwood, all Nicholas\u2019s houses were private residences and not open to the public. She turned to Thornwyck Castle. It too was a private residence, but a small section of it was open to the public on Thursdays. \u201cThe current duke feels that the beauty of Thornwyck, designed by his ancestor, the brilliant scholar Nicholas Stafford, must be shared with the world,\u201d she read.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Brilliant scholar,\u2019\u201d she whispered. Not the ladies\u2019 man he had once been called. Not a rogue, not a wastrel, but a \u201cbrilliant scholar.\u201d</p><p>She closed the guidebook and looked up. The waitress was hovering over her with an odd expression on her face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSomething wrong with your fork?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cFork?\u201d Dougless couldn\u2019t think what the woman was talking about. The waitress continued to stare at Dougless until she looked down at her empty plate. There beside it lay an unused fork. Dougless had eaten her meal with a spoon and a knife. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I just\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t think of what to say, so she gave the woman a weak smile and looked at the bill. The amount\u2014enough to buy a hundred medieval dinners\u2014made her blanch, but she paid it.</p><p>And before she left, she asked the waitress what day of the week it was\u2014something she couldn\u2019t remember\u2014and was pleased to find out that it was Wednesday.</p><p>Outside again, she didn\u2019t allow herself to stand still. If she stayed in one place too long, she knew that she\u2019d start to think; she\u2019d think about Nicholas, about losing him, and about never seeing him again.</p> <p>She practically ran to the train station to catch the first train to Bellwood. She had to see what had changed. On the train ride she made herself read the guidebook, anything to fill her mind.</p><p>By now she knew the way to Bellwood from the train station very well. According to twentieth-century time, she had visited the house only the day before\u2014the day when she\u2019d heard of Nicholas\u2019s execution. The guide hadn\u2019t been very pleasant. After all, she remembered Dougless as having opened and closed the alarmed door and disturbing her tour.</p><p>Dougless bought her ticket and guidebook for the tour, and when she got in line, the same guide was at the head.</p><p>In the house, Dougless, who had once thought it was so beautiful, now saw it as bare and drab and lifeless. There were no plates of gold and silver on the hearths, no exquisite needlework on the tables, no cushions on the chairs. But most of all there were no richly dressed people moving about, no people laughing, and no music anywhere.</p><p>They were at Nicholas\u2019s room before Dougless could recover from her distaste for the barren house. She stood to one side, looked up at Nicholas\u2019s portrait, and listened to the guide. The story was different now\u2014very, very different.</p> <p>The guide could not use enough superlatives when describing Nicholas.</p><p>\u201cHe was a true Renaissance man,\u201d the guide told them, \u201cthe epitome of what his era hoped to achieve. He designed beautiful houses that were a hundred years ahead of his time. He made great advances in the field of medicine, even writing a book on disease prevention that, had it been adhered to, would have saved thousands of lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did the book say?\u201d Dougless asked.</p><p>The guide gave her a hard look, obviously remembering the door-opening incident. \u201cBasically, Lord Nicholas talked of cleanliness and said that doctors and midwives must wash their hands before touching a patient. Now, if you\u2019ll follow me, we shall see\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dougless left the tour after that, went out the entrance, and walked to the village library.</p><p>She spent the afternoon reading the history books. Every scrap of information was different now. She saw the names of people she had known and come to love. They were just names in history books to other readers, but to her they were flesh and blood people.</p> <p>After three husbands, Lady Margaret never married again, and lived into her seventies.</p><p>Kit had married little Lucy, and one book said Lucy had come to be a great benefactress who encouraged musicians and artists. Kit had run the Stafford estates well until he died of a stomach ailment at age forty-two. Since he and Lucy had had no children, the earldom and estates went to Nicholas.</p><p>As she read about Nicholas, she touched the printed words, as though they could make him seem closer. When she read that Nicholas had never married, quick tears came to her eyes, but she blinked them away.</p><p>Nicholas had lived to the grand old age of sixty-two, and during his life he had done many great things. The books went into detail about the beauty and creativity of the buildings he had designed. \u201cHis use of glass was far ahead of its time,\u201d one author wrote.</p><p>One book told of Nicholas\u2019s ideas about medicine, how he had crusaded for cleanliness. \u201cHad his advice been taken,\u201d the author said, \u201cmodern medicine would have had its start hundreds of years earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar ahead of his time,\u201d the books said again and again.</p><p>She leaned back in her chair. No Arabella-on-the-table. No diary being found that told of what a womanizer Nicholas was. No betrayal. No conspiracy between his wife and his friend. And, most important, no execution.</p><p>She left when the library closed, walked to the station, and took a train back to Ashburton. She still had a room at the hotel and her clothes were there.</p> <p>Once in her hotel room, she had difficulty adjusting to the modernness of it, especially the bathroom. She took a shower, but couldn\u2019t bear the hot water or the hard, sharp forcefulness of the showerhead. She turned the knobs until the water was a lukewarm drizzle and felt more at home.</p><p>The flushing of the toilet seemed like a waste of water to her, and she kept staring at the big mirror in wonder.</p><p>After a room service supper, she put on her flimsy nightgown and felt like a lewd woman. And when she went to bed, she felt lonely without Honoria beside her.</p><p>Surprisingly, she went to sleep immediately, and if she dreamed, she did not remember doing so.</p><p>In the morning she had difficulty with the hotel when she asked for beef and beer for breakfast, but the English, better than any other people on earth, understood eccentrics.</p><p>She reached Thornwyck Castle by ten A.M., just as the gates were opening. She bought a ticket and started on the tour. The guide talked at length about the Stafford family, some of whose members still owned the house, and especially about their brilliant ancestor, Nicholas Stafford.</p><p>\u201cHe never married,\u201d the guide said with twinkling eyes, \u201cbut he had a son named James. When Nicholas\u2019s older brother died and left no children, Nicholas inherited, and when Nicholas died, the Stafford estates went to James.\u201d</p><p>Dougless smiled, remembering the sweet little boy she had played with.</p><p>The guide continued. \u201cJames made a brilliant marriage and tripled the family fortunes. It was through James that the Stafford family really made its money.\u201d</p><p>And he would have died if Dougless had not intervened.</p><p>The guide went on to the next generation of the family and the next room, but Dougless slipped away. When she\u2019d seen Thornwyck before, it had been half in ruins, but Nicholas had shown her the corbel with Kit\u2019s face high on the wall of what would have been the second floor. Unfortunately, the second floor was not open to the public.</p><p>But Dougless had been through too much to allow anything to stop her. She opened a door that said NO ADMITTANCE, and found herself in a small sitting room furnished in English chintz. Feeling like a spy, but also knowing that she had to do what she did, she went to the doorway and peered out. The hall was clear, so she tiptoed down it, thinking that carpet on the floor made sneaking much easier than noisy rushes.</p><p>She found a staircase and went up to the second floor. Twice she had to hide when she heard footsteps, but no one saw her. In Nicholas\u2019s time there would have been so many servants running about that it would have been impossible for an intruder to get to the second floor unnoticed, but those days were long gone.</p><p>Once on the second floor, she had trouble orienting herself as she tried to remember just where the corbel would be. She searched three rooms before she entered a bedroom and saw it, high up above a beautiful walnut dresser.</p><p>She plastered herself between the dresser and the wall as a maid walked out of the adjoining bath. Dougless held her breath as the maid straightened the bedspread, then left the room.</p><p>Alone again, Dougless went to work. She pulled a heavy chair beside the dresser, climbed on it, then, after three tries, managed to climb on top of the dresser. She had just put her hand on the old stone corbel when the door opened. Dougless flattened herself against the wall.</p><p>The maid came in again, this time with an armload of towels that blocked her from seeing Dougless. She didn\u2019t breathe until the woman left.</p><p>When the door closed, Dougless turned and touched Kit\u2019s stone face. The stonework looked to be solid and she wished she\u2019d had the foresight to bring a screwdriver or small crowbar. She pulled and tugged at the face and was almost ready to give up when the stone moved in her hand.</p><p>She broke her nails and skinned her knuckles, but she was at last able to pull the face away. A long piece of stone protruded from the back of the face and fit neatly into the corbel.</p><p>Standing on tiptoe, Dougless looked behind the head. Inside a hollowed-out place was a small cloth-wrapped package. Quickly, she took the package, slipped it into her pocket, then shoved the corbel back into place and climbed down. She didn\u2019t take the time to put the chair back as she hurried from the room.</p><p>She made it, without being seen, back to the tour just as the group was in the last room.</p><p>\u201cAnd here we have the lace display,\u201d the guide was saying. \u201cMost of the lace is Victorian, but we do have a very special piece of lace from the sixteenth century.\u201d</p><p>Dougless gave the guide all of her attention.</p><p>\u201cIt seems that although Lord Nicholas Stafford of the sixteenth century never married, there was a mysterious woman in his past. On his deathbed he asked to be buried with this piece of lace, but there was some confusion and Lord Nicholas went to his grave without the lace. His son, James, said the lace was always to be kept in a place of honor in the family, since it had meant so much to his beloved father.\u201d</p><p>Dougless had to wait for the other tourists to move before she could see into the case. There, under glass, yellowed now and wornlooking, was the lace cuff Honoria had been making for her. The name Dougless was worked into it.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Dougless\u2019?\u201d a tourist said, laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s a man\u2019s name. Maybe ol\u2019 Nick didn\u2019t marry because he was a little\u201d\u2014he waved his hand\u2014\u201cyou know.\u201d</p><p>Dougless spoke before the guide could. \u201cFor your information, \u2018Dougless\u2019 was a woman\u2019s name in the sixteenth century, and I can assure you that Lord Nicholas Stafford was not a little\u201d\u2014she glared at him\u2014 \u201c\u2018you know.\u2019\u201d Storming past him, she left the house.</p><p>She walked into the gardens, and while other tourists exclaimed over their beauty, Dougless thought they looked messy and neglected. She went to a quiet corner, sat on a bench, then took the package from her pocket.</p><p>Slowly, she unwrapped it. Touching the waxed cloth bindings that had last been touched by Nicholas so long ago, made her fingers tremble.</p><p>The miniature portrait of Nicholas came to light, as rich and bright as the day it had been painted. \u201cNicholas,\u201d she whispered as she put her fingertips on the painting. \u201cOh, Nicholas, have I truly lost you completely? Are you gone from me forever?\u201d</p><p>She looked at the miniature, touched it, and when she turned it over, she saw something engraved on the back. Holding it up to the light, she read the inscription.</p><p>Time has no meaning</p><p>Love will endure</p><p>He had signed it with an N, a D over the top of it.</p><p>Leaning back against the old stone wall, she blinked away tears. \u201cNicholas, come back to me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cPlease come back to me.\u201d</p><p>She sat there for a long time before she rose. She\u2019d missed lunch, so she went to the tea shop and sat down with a plate of scones and a pot of strong black tea. She\u2019d bought a guidebook at Bellwood and one at Thornwyck, and as she ate and drank, she read.</p><p>With every word she read, she told herself that what had happened had been worth the pain of losing the man she loved. What did the love between two people matter when, by giving up their love, they had changed history? Kit had lived, Lady Margaret had lived, James had lived\u2014and Nicholas had lived. And with their lives, the family honor had been saved, so that today a Stafford was a duke and part of the royal family.</p><p>Against all that, what did one piddling little love affair mean?</p><p>She left the tea shop and walked to the train station. She could go home now, she thought, home to America, home to her family. No more would she be an outsider, and never again would she have to pretend to be someone she was not.</p><p>On the train ride back to Ashburton, she told herself that she should be jubilant. She and Nicholas had accomplished so much. How many other people had had the good fortune to be able to change history? Yet Dougless had been given that opportunity. Through her efforts the Stafford family was doing well. There were beautiful buildings standing because she had encouraged Nicholas to use his talent for designing. There were . . .</p><p>Her thoughts trailed off. It was no use telling herself what she should feel, because what she did feel was miserable.</p><p>In Ashburton she slowly walked back to the hotel. She\u2019d need to call the airlines and make reservations.</p><p>In the lobby, Robert and Gloria were waiting for her. At the moment she didn\u2019t think she could handle a confrontation. She hardly looked at Robert. \u201cI\u2019ll get the bracelet,\u201d she said, then turned away before he could speak.</p><p>Catching her arm, he halted her. \u201cDougless, could we talk?\u201d</p><p>She stiffened, preparing herself for his abuse. \u201cI told you I\u2019d get the bracelet for you, and I apologize for keeping it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, and his eyes were soft.</p><p>Dougless looked at Gloria. Gone from the girl\u2019s face was the smug, I\u2019m-going-to-get-you look. Wary, Dougless went to sit on a chair across from father and daughter. Lucy, and Robert Sydney, Dougless thought. How much Gloria looked like Kit\u2019s bride-to-be and how much this Robert resembled a sixteenth-century Robert. Dougless thought of how she and Nicholas had changed the lives of both of those people. Robert Sydney had been given no reason to hate Nicholas because Arabella had not been impregnated on a table. And Dougless had helped Lucy gain some self-confidence.</p><p>Robert cleared his throat, then spoke. \u201cGloria and I have been talking, and we, well, we decided that maybe we weren\u2019t quite fair to you.\u201d</p><p>Dougless stared at him, her eyes wide. At one point in her life she had looked at Robert while wearing a blindfold. She saw only what she\u2019d wanted to see; she had endowed him with characteristics that he didn\u2019t have. Now, looking back at their life together, she saw that he\u2019d never loved her. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d she asked tiredly.</p><p>\u201cWe just wanted to apologize,\u201d Robert said, \u201cand we\u2019d like for you to join us on the rest of the trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can sit in front,\u201d Gloria said.</p><p>Dougless looked from one to the other, puzzled, not by their words, for Robert would often apologize to get her to do what he wanted, but by the sincere looks on their faces. It was almost as though they really meant what they were saying. \u201cNo,\u201d she said softly, \u201cI\u2019m going home tomorrow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Robert reached out and took her hand. \u201cHome to my house, I hope.\u201d His eyes were bright. \u201cTo the house that will be ours as soon as we\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried?\u201d Dougless whispered.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Dougless, I\u2019m asking you to marry me. I was a fool not to see how good we were together.\u201d</p><p>Dougless gave a bit of a smile. Here was what she\u2019d wanted so much: marriage to a respectable, stable man.</p> <p>She took a deep breath and smiled more broadly, for suddenly she didn\u2019t feel like selling herself so cheaply. She was no longer the baby of the family who wasn\u2019t as good as her big sisters. She was a woman who had been transported to a foreign time, and not only had she survived, she had succeeded in accomplishing a monumental task. No longer did she need to prove herself to her too-perfect family by bringing home an achieving husband. No, Dougless was the achiever now.</p><p>She picked up Robert\u2019s hand and put it back on his lap. \u201cThanks, but no thanks,\u201d she said pleasantly.</p><p>\u201cBut I thought you wanted to get married.\u201d He looked to be genuinely confused.</p><p>\u201cAnd Daddy said I could be your maid of honor,\u201d Gloria said.</p><p>\u201cWhen I do get married, it will be to someone who wants to give to me,\u201d Dougless said, then looked at Gloria. \u201cAnd I will choose my own bridesmaids.\u201d</p> <p>Gloria turned red and looked down at her hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed, Dougless,\u201d Robert said softly.</p><p>\u201cI have, haven\u2019t I?\u201d she answered, wonder in her voice. \u201cI really, truly have changed.\u201d She stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll get your bracelet now.\u201d</p><p>When she started toward the stairs, Robert followed her, Gloria remaining in the lobby. He didn\u2019t speak to her until she unlocked her room and went inside. Following her inside, he shut the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cDougless, is it someone else?\u201d</p><p>She took the diamond bracelet from where she\u2019d hidden it in her suitcase and held it out to him. \u201cThere is no one,\u201d she said, feeling the loss of Nicholas.</p> <p>\u201cNot even the man you said you were helping to research?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe research is done, and he\u2019s . . . gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPermanently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs permanently as time can manage.\u201d She looked away a moment, then back at him. \u201cI\u2019m quite tired now, and I have a long flight tomorrow, so I\u2019ll say good-bye. When I get back to the States, I\u2019ll clear my things out of your house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDougless, please reconsider. We can\u2019t end what we\u2019ve had because of a little argument. We love each other.\u201d</p><p>When she looked at him, she thought about how at one time in her life she\u2019d thought she loved him. But now she knew their relationship had been one-sided, with Dougless doing all the pleading, all the trying-to-please. \u201cWhat has changed you?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow could you leave me stranded in a foreign country with no money just a few days ago and now be here asking me to marry you?\u201d</p><p>Robert\u2019s face turned a bit red, and he looked away sheepishly. \u201cI really do apologize about that.\u201d When he looked back at her, his face was filled with sincerity\u2014and also a little confusion. \u201cIt was the oddest thing. You know, all your family\u2019s money used to make me furious. I put myself through medical school while living on canned beans, yet you\u2019d always had everything. You have a family who adores you and a history of wealth that goes back centuries. I hated the way you used to play at living on your teacher\u2019s salary, because I knew you could get all the money you ever wanted if you\u2019d just ask. When I left you at that church, I knew Gloria had your bag, and I was glad. I wanted you to see what it was like to have to survive without money, to have to rely on yourself as I\u2019ve always had to.\u201d</p><p>He took a breath and his face softened. \u201cBut then, yesterday, everything changed. Gloria and I were in a restaurant, and quite suddenly I wished you were with us. I . . . I wasn\u2019t angry at you anymore. Does that make sense? All the anger I felt for your having been given everything just evaporated. Gone, as though it\u2019d never been there.\u201d</p> <p>He went to her and put his hands on her shoulders. \u201cI was a fool to let someone like you get away. If you\u2019ll let me, I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life making it up to you. We don\u2019t have to get married if you don\u2019t want to. We don\u2019t have to live together. I\u2019ll . . . I\u2019ll court you if you\u2019ll allow me. I\u2019ll court you with flowers and candy and . . . and balloons. What do you say? Give me another chance?\u201d</p><p>Dougless stared at him. He said that yesterday his anger had left him. All her days in the sixteenth century had passed in just a few minutes of twentieth-century time, and during her time with Nicholas, she had defused the anger of Robert\u2019s and Gloria\u2019s look-alikes. Could this Robert\u2019s anger have been based on his bitterness over what had happened in the sixteenth century? When Robert had first seen Nicholas, he had looked at him with rage. Why? Because Nicholas had once impregnated his wife?</p><p>And Gloria seemed to be no longer angry with Dougless. Because Dougless had helped an earlier incarnation of Gloria? Because an earlier Gloria no longer believed the man she loved wanted Dougless?</p><p>Dougless gave her head a shake to clear it. Were I to die tomorrow, my soul would remember you, Nicholas had said. Did Robert and Gloria have the souls of people who had lived before?</p><p>\u201cWill you give me another chance?\u201d Robert repeated.</p><p>Smiling, Dougless kissed him on the cheek. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201calthough I thank you very much for the offer.\u201d</p><p>When she pulled away from him, Dougless was glad to see he wasn\u2019t angry. \u201cSomeone else?\u201d he asked again, as though his ego could stand that rejection better than her choosing to have no one rather than him.</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d</p><p>Robert looked at the bracelet in his hand. \u201cIf I\u2019d bought an engagement ring instead of this . . . Well, who knows?\u201d He looked back at her. \u201cHe\u2019s a lucky S.O.B, whoever he is. I wish you all the luck in the world.\u201d He left the room, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>Dougless stood in the empty room for a moment, then went to the telephone to call her parents. She wanted to hear the sound of their voices.</p><p>Elizabeth answered.</p><p>\u201cAre Mother and Dad back yet?\u201d Dougless asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019re still at the cabin. Dougless, I demand that you tell me what is going on. If you\u2019re in one of your scrapes again, you\u2019d better tell me so I can get you out of it. You aren\u2019t the one in jail this time, are you?\u201d</p><p>Dougless was amazed to find that the words of her perfect older sister didn\u2019t anger her, nor did they make her feel guilty. \u201cElizabeth,\u201d she said firmly, \u201cI would appreciate it if you didn\u2019t speak to me in that manner. I called to tell my family that I am coming home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean anything; it\u2019s just that usually you\u2019re in one mess or another.\u201d</p><p>Dougless did not speak.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I apologize. Would you like me to meet you and Robert at the airport, or does he have his car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobert won\u2019t be with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Elizabeth said again, allowing time for Dougless to explain. When Dougless was silent, Elizabeth went on. \u201cDougless, we\u2019ll all be very glad to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be glad to see you. Don\u2019t meet me, I\u2019ll rent a car, and, Elizabeth, I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause, then Elizabeth said, \u201cCome home and I\u2019ll cook a celebration dinner.\u201d</p><p>Dougless groaned. \u201cWhen did you say Mother was returning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, so I\u2019m not the world\u2019s best cook. You cook, I\u2019ll clean up the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a deal. I\u2019ll be there day after tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDougless!\u201d Elizabeth said. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you too.\u201d</p><p>Dougless put down the telephone and smiled. It seemed that not only had history changed, but so had the present. She knew, felt inside herself, that never again was she going to be the butt of the family\u2019s jokes, because no longer did she feel incompetent, as though she couldn\u2019t handle her own life.</p><p>She called Heathrow, booked her flight, then began to pack.</p><p>THIRTY - FOUR</p><p>Dougless had to get up very early to catch the train to London; then she took a long, expensive taxi ride to the airport. The sense of accomplishment that had sustained her since she\u2019d left the sixteenth century was leaving her. All she felt now was very tired and very alone. She\u2019d fallen in love with Nicholas twice. Every passing second seemed to bring memories back to her. She remembered when he\u2019d been in the twentieth century and the wonder on his face as he\u2019d touched a book of color photographs. She remembered the way he\u2019d been fascinated with watching the taxi driver shift gears. And the Playboy magazine in the drawer at Arabella\u2019s!</p><p>When she went to the sixteenth century and he hadn\u2019t remembered her and he\u2019d even seemed to hate her, she\u2019d thought he\u2019d changed. But he hadn\u2019t. He was still the man who put his family before himself, and when he began to include Dougless in his family, he had loved her as completely as he did them.</p><p>When the boarding of the plane was called, Dougless waited until the last minute to get on. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t leave England. If she remained in England, she would be closer to Nicholas. Maybe she should buy a house in Ashburton and visit his tomb every day. Maybe if she prayed enough, she would be returned to him, or him to her.</p><p>She tried to control herself, but the tears started anyway. Nicholas was truly and completely gone from her. Never again would she see him, hear him, or touch him.</p><p>Tears were blinding her so much that as she boarded, she walked into the man in front of her and her tote bag slid off her shoulder onto the lap of a first-class passenger.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said; then she looked into the blue eyes of a very handsome man. For a moment her heart pounded, but she made herself turn away. He wasn\u2019t Nicholas; his eyes weren\u2019t Nicholas\u2019s eyes.</p><p>She took her tote bag from the man while he stared up at her with interest. But Dougless wasn\u2019t interested. The only man who interested her was sealed inside a marble tomb.</p><p>She made her way back to her seat, shoved her tote bag under the seat in front of her, then looked out the window. As the plane began to taxi down the runway and she realized that she was leaving England, she began to cry in earnest. The man in the aisle seat beside her, an Englishman, buried his face deeper into his newspaper.</p><p>Dougless tried to make her tears stop. She gave herself little pep talks about how much she\u2019d been able to accomplish, and reminded herself that losing Nicholas was a small price to pay for all the good she\u2019d done. But each thought made her cry harder.</p><p>By the time the plane was aloft and the FASTEN SEAT BELT sign was off, she was crying so hard that she didn\u2019t see what happened next to her. The man from first class, a champagne bottle and two glasses in his hand, asked the man next to Dougless to exchange seats.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said.</p><p>She could see through her tears a tall glass of champagne being held out to her.</p><p>\u201cGo on, take it. It\u2019ll do you good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an A-American,\u201d she said through tears.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m from Colorado. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cM-Maine.\u201d She took the champagne, drank too fast, and choked. \u201cI-I have cousins in Colorado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChandler.\u201d Her tears weren\u2019t flowing as fast.</p><p>\u201cNot the Taggerts?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him. Black hair and blue eyes. Just like Nicholas. The tears sped up again. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI used to go to Chandler with my father sometimes, and I met some of the Taggerts. I\u2019m Reed Stanford, by the way.\u201d He held out his hand to shake hers, but when she didn\u2019t move, he picked up her hand off her lap and clasped it in his. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d He didn\u2019t release her hand, but looked at it, saying nothing, until Dougless snatched her hand away.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMr. . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStanford.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Stanford,\u201d she said, sniffing, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I did to give you the impression that I\u2019m an easy pickup, but I can assure you that I\u2019m not. I think you\u2019d better take your champagne and return to your own seat.\u201d She was trying to be regal, but her effort lost something, since her nose was red, her eyes swollen, and tears were running down her cheeks.</p><p>He didn\u2019t take the glass and he didn\u2019t leave.</p><p>He was beginning to make Dougless angry. Was he some pervert who liked crying females? What in the world had happened in his childhood to cause him to be turned on by tears? \u201cIf you don\u2019t leave, I\u2019ll have to call the attendant.\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at her. \u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d he said, and there was something in his eyes that made Dougless halt as she reached for the call button. \u201cYou must believe me; I\u2019ve never done anything like this in my life. I mean, I\u2019ve never accosted a woman on a plane before. Or even in a bar, for that matter. It\u2019s just that you remind me of someone.\u201d</p><p>Dougless wasn\u2019t crying any longer because there was something eerily familiar in the way he moved his head. \u201cWho?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He gave a little grin, and Dougless\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Nicholas sometimes grinned like that. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told you. It\u2019s too far-fetched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me. I have a lot of imagination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cYou remind me of a lady in a portrait.\u201d</p><p>Dougless was listening now.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a boy, about eleven, I think, my parents, my older brother, and I came to England for a year to live. My father had a job here. My mother used to drag my brother and me to antiques stores, and I\u2019m afraid that I wasn\u2019t very gracious about going. That is, until one Saturday afternoon when I saw the portrait.\u201d</p><p>Pausing, he refilled Dougless\u2019s empty glass. \u201cThe portrait was a miniature oil, done sometime in the sixteenth century, and it was a picture of a lady.\u201d He looked at her, and in spite of her swollen face, his eyes were almost caressing.</p><p>\u201cI wanted that portrait. I can\u2019t explain it. It wasn\u2019t that I just wanted it; I had to have it.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I wasn\u2019t exactly sweet-tempered about voicing my wants. The portrait was quite expensive and my mother refused to listen to my demands, but I\u2019ve never taken no for an answer. The next Saturday I took the tube, went back to the antique shop, and offered everything I had as a down payment on the portrait. I think it was about five pounds.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled in memory. \u201cLooking back on it, I think the old man who owned the shop thought I wanted to be a collector. But I didn\u2019t want to collect; I just wanted that portrait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you get it?\u201d Dougless whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. My parents thought I was crazy and said an Elizabethan miniature was no possession for a child, but when they saw me, week after week, giving all my allowance toward the purchase of that miniature, they began to help me. Then, just before we left England, when I\u2019d begun to feel that I was never going to get enough money together to buy it, my father drove me to the antique shop and presented the portrait to me.\u201d</p><p>The man sat back in his seat, as though that were the end of the story.</p> <p>\u201cDo you have the portrait?\u201d Dougless whispered.</p><p>\u201cAlways. I\u2019m never without it. Would you like to see it?\u201d</p><p>Dougless could only nod.</p><p>From his inside coat pocket, he withdrew a little leather case and handed it to her. Slowly, Dougless opened the box. There, on black velvet, was the portrait Nicholas had had painted of her. It was encased in silver and around the edges were seed pearls.</p><p>Without asking permission, Dougless lifted the miniature from the case, turned it over, then held it up to the light.</p> <p>\u201cMy soul will find yours,\u201d Reed said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it says on the back, and it\u2019s signed with a C. I\u2019ve always wondered what the words meant and what the C stood for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin,\u201d Dougless said before she thought.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin is my middle name. Reed Colin Stanford.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him then, really looked at him. He glanced down at the portrait, then up at her, and when he did so, he looked at her through his lashes, just as Nicholas used to do. \u201cWhat do you do for a living?\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m an architect.\u201d</p><p>She drew in her breath. \u201cHave you ever been married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do get to the point, don\u2019t you? No, I\u2019ve never been married, but I\u2019ll tell you the truth: I once left a woman practically at the altar. It was the worst thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was her name?\u201d Dougless\u2019s voice was lower than a whisper.</p><p>\u201cLeticia.\u201d</p><p>It was at that point that the stewardess stopped by their seats. \u201cWe have roast beef or chicken Kiev for dinner tonight. Which would you like?\u201d</p><p>Reed turned to Dougless. \u201cWill you have dinner with me?\u201d</p><p>My soul will find yours, Nicholas had written. Souls, not bodies, but souls. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll have dinner with you.\u201d</p> <p>He smiled at her and it was Nicholas\u2019s smile.</p><p>Thank You, God, she thought. Thank You. </p> </body></html>"]
