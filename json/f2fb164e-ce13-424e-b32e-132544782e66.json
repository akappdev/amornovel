I hope these new team members can help make a difference. Something has to.</p><p>\u2014Gabriel</p><p>Edinburgh, Scotland</p><p>Old Town</p><p>Late October</p> <p>Blood. Holy Christ, there\u2019s so much of it. Everywhere. Bodies. Human bodies. Crumpled, laying in distorted ways, jagged bones jutting through ripped clothes as they lay lifeless on the cobbled stones. Against the buildings. So many. My stomach rolls, and I look away. I breathe, carefully picking my way through. It\u2019s cold. Windy. Now the streets are barren. Where did the blood, the bodies go? I\u2019m not here alone. I feel a presence.</p><p>It\u2019s behind me. Hugging the shadows. So fast, I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s running, flying, or scaling the walls.</p><p>Doesn\u2019t really matter. Either way, I\u2019m being stalked.</p><p>And it\u2019s one of the Black Fallen.</p><p>Hurrying along the sidewalk, I slip into a narrow alley and press my back against the aged stones. A dim streetlamp overhangs the eve above, and the shadows reach long and jagged toward me. I listen closely. The air suddenly shifts, and in the next second I leap over the alley to the opposite wall. I climb, and in seconds I\u2019m on the roof. I crouch, my fingers curled around the ledge, peering into the pitch darkness below. Waiting.</p><p>I know he\u2019s coming for me.</p> <p>I want him to.</p><p>Leaning back on my heels, I find the hilt of my silver blade that\u2019s tucked into the back of my jeans, and palm it tightly. My eyes search the alley, the street and shadows below. Then I lift my gaze to study the jagged rooftops. It\u2019s here. Hiding. Lurking. Adrenaline rushes through me, and I draw a deep breath\u2014</p><p>I\u2019m on my back, rolling away, then I lurch up and crouch several feet from the ledge.</p><p>No one is there. My blade is drawn, my body rigid. Ready.</p><p>\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdYou\u2019re fast,\u201d a voice whispers behind me.</p><p>I whip around, and slash my blade.</p><p>A figure jerks back, then laughs darkly. \u201cAlmost too fast. But not quite.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, he\u2019s in front of me, and strong fingers grasp my throat. I\u2019m lifted off my feet as he walks toward the ledge. I try to slash at him with the blade, kick, throw my legs around him, but I\u2019m paralyzed. I can\u2019t even scream. The shadows fall onto his face, blurring his features together. I can do nothing more than stare.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re powerless, my young mixed-blood,\u201d he says. His voice is deep, his accent . . . old. \u201cYou can do nothing to stop me.\u201d He swings me out and shakes me over the ledge. Nothing but air separates me from the stone cobbles thirty feet below. He\u2019s using some kind of mind-power shit on me and it\u2019s pissing me off. My gaze never leaves the vicinity of his.</p><p>\u201cOh. Strong-willed, are you?\u201d he says. I can hear laughter in his voice, shaking me again. He\u2019s only toying with me, amused. \u201cStrength will get you nowhere with me,\u201d he warns, and gives me another shake. \u201cSee how you\u2019re nothing but a weak mortal now? All those powers you\u2019ve acquired? Gone. You\u2019d be better off to join us.\u201d He cocks his head. \u201cWould you?\u201d</p><p>I try to answer, but my throat is squeezed shut.</p><p>He laughs. \u201cOh. Forgive me,\u201d he says, and loosens his grip on me. \u201cNow, what was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo fuck yourself,\u201d I say in a hoarse whisper.</p><p>Instantly, my throat is released, and I\u2019m falling fast, the cobbles reaching up to me, and his laughter resonating off the stone walls, and the broken bodies along the cobbles begin screaming my name\u2014</p><p>\u201cRiley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I jerk up, my eyes fluttering open.</p><p>\u201cYou were sleeping,\u201d a raspy, familiar voice says. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>I turn my head and look. It\u2019s Eli. Relief washes over me. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s blue eyes narrow. Nail me to my seat. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cJust a dream, big guy. No big deal. Honest.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s mouth tips at the corner. \u201cYou don\u2019t have normal dreams, Ri.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s right. I sure as hell don\u2019t. \u201cI just dreamed a Black Fallen kicked my ass.\u201d</p><p>Eli sighs and closes his eyes. Frustration rolls off him in waves. \u201cRiley,\u201d he begins, and looks at me.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d I finish. \u201cCross my heart, I will let you know if anything weird happens.\u201d</p><p>His cerulean stare is disbelieving. I really don\u2019t blame him, either.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there. Fifteen minutes, tops.\u201d</p><p>I lean forward a little and glance past Eli at Jake Andorra. My new boss.</p><p>He grins. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>The Rover pitches forward and my hand involuntarily tightens around the leather strap suspended above the door that I\u2019ve had a death grip on ever since the vehicle left the parking lot at the airport. Our driver, Peter, is an old guy with a shock of gray hair covered by a tweed cap. Peter is clearly insane and lacks an updated driver\u2019s license. Maybe he\u2019s never even had one. Peter hits the gas and passes a slower driver. We all lunge forward. My stomach turns.</p><p>\u201cOch. Sorry \u2019bout that,\u201d says Peter nonchalantly in heavy Scottish brogue.</p><p>Jake chuckles.</p><p>\u201cIgnore him,\u201d Eli says, and leans close. His lips graze my ear, and I\u2019m not at all surprised at the shiver it causes within me. \u201cHe likes to get you riled up.\u201d</p><p>I glare at Jake, who shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d he admits.</p><p>I turn away and ignore him. Eli\u2019s right. Jake is one cocky ass. Hot as mess, but an ass all the same.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jake says.</p><p>I shoot him another glare. Mind readers suck. And I\u2019m surrounded by them\u2014including my immortal druid boss and the gorgeous vampire sitting next to me.</p><p>Staring out of the window, I can see my ghostly reflection in the glass. I finger my long bangs. Gone are the magenta highlights I\u2019ve worn in my hair forever. My varying layers now hang straight in solid sheets of jet-black. Jake had advised me to draw less attention to myself. That almost makes me laugh out loud, even now. As if the inky angel wings tattooed at the corner of my left eye and the massive dragon etched into my back and down both of my arms aren\u2019t enough of an attention grabber. I had agreed, though, to axe the highlights for now. Besides, they were work to keep up with. And they seemed to fit my lifestyle back in Savannah as master tattoo artist and proprietor of Inksomnia. Back when life was easy and uncomplicated. Greasy Krystal hamburgers and hot, melting Krispy Kreme doughnuts. Chick-O-Sticks and RC Cola. Boiled peanuts. Crabs and oysters.</p><p>Nothing will ever be that easy again.</p><p>Jake Andorra recruited me to join an elite task force known as WUP, or Worldwide Unexplained Phenomenon, a few months ago. Up until then I\u2019d been a slayer of all things otherworldly and dangerous\u2014until I became both of those things myself. Now everything has changed.</p><p>I study the Edinburgh skyline as it emerges through a hazy gray mist. The heavy, salty scent of the ocean\u2014a smell that I\u2019m very familiar with\u2014seeps in through the cracks of the car and infiltrates my nostrils as it rolls in from the North Sea. A small slice of familiarity to keep me from missing home, from missing my little brother, Seth, or my surrogate grandparents, Estelle and Preacher. Or my best friend, Nyx. But this is my first task for WUP, and I have to give it my very best.</p><p>We\u2019re in a steady stream of traffic as our convoy of four vehicles moves along the M8 toward Edinburgh. We\u2019d landed in Glasgow and met up with a man named Darius, who now trails behind our Rover of Death, piloted by Peter the Insane, in another vehicle. Although Darius helped save my life once before, I don\u2019t know him well. He\u2019s an ancient immortal Pict warrior, and I mean ancient as in from the days of Merlin kind of ancient. From what Jake tells me, Darius is a powerhouse of strength. Mind and body. But that\u2019s all I know. Behind Darius are two other elite WUP crew members: Ginger Slater and Lucian MacLeod. The only werewolves I\u2019ve ever met. Like Darius, I still have more to learn about them.</p><p>In the final car are two people\u2014or vampires, if you want to be exact\u2014from home who were also recruited to the Scotland task force. One, Noah Miles. Eli\u2019s best friend and head guardian of Charleston, South Carolina. A total bad-boy vamp who pushes every single limit thrown his way. Easygoing and full of southern charm, it\u2019s almost like watching a magic show when he morphs into full-fledged fighting vampire. It\u2019s a thing of beauty. To me, anyway. And he\u2019s saved my ass more times than I can count.</p><p>And then there\u2019s Victorian Arcos. Our history is so complicated it could fill a book. Even as I think about the strigoi vampire who bit me\u2014whose DNA flows through my veins\u2014I have to look away from Eli. A scrutinizing look from him, and I can tell he knows where my thoughts are.</p><p>I blow against the window and the glass fogs from my surprisingly still-warm breath. Outside, the air is chilly, everything a stony gray. Because I have the ability to hear things acutely miles and miles away, I have to work extra hard to tune everything out and concentrate on just my thoughts. Of who and what I am. Of what\u2019s become of me.</p><p>I was bitten by not one vampire, but four in total. Three of those bites came from deadly, powerful strigoi vampires. One came from Eli, simply because he wanted some normal vampire venom flowing through my body. Three were courtesy of the Arcoses, including the one who now rides with us through the streets of Edinburgh. It makes things tense between all of us, and it makes me . . . special. I carry a little of each of their extraordinary traits. I\u2019m not quite strigoi, yet there\u2019s very little of the human left in me now. But after that dream I just had, who the hell knows how much help I can be here. What if the Fallen have the power to strip me of all my strigoi abilities? I can\u2019t even think that way now. I have to concentrate. Fight. Stay alive.</p><p>Eli\u2019s fingers lace through mine and he squeezes my hand. He knows me so well; he\u2019s trying to distract me from thoughts that he knows disturb me.</p><p>Eligius Dupr\u00e9. Deadly predator. Violent vampire. Fiercely loyal. And now he\u2019s my fianc\u00e9. My sensitive, hot, kick-ass vampire fianc\u00e9. We\u2019ve been through a lot together. He saved not only my life, but my brother\u2019s as well. I owe him everything, and there\u2019s nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for him. I\u2019m almost a completely respectable woman now. Who would\u2019ve ever thought that I, Riley Poe, ex-gang member, troublemaking punk kid could have a degree in art, own her own ink shop, and be engaged? How\u2019s that for crazy? We haven\u2019t set a date yet, but I\u2019m pretty sure we won\u2019t even have time to think about that until matters are finished here in Scotland. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I glance outside to check on our progress, and we are much closer to the city. Tall dark spires and ancient stone architecture poke through the mist, and the formidable Edinburgh Castle looms above Old Town in its gloomy, ominous splendor. I\u2019d Googled the city to familiarize myself with it, and I admit: it\u2019s pretty freaking cool. Even knowing evil resides here and what we face in taking that evil down doesn\u2019t deter me from wanting to check it all out for myself. Scottish history seems interesting and this place is loaded with it. So says Jake.</p><p>Peter exits the M8, and in minutes we\u2019re weaving through the narrow streets of Edinburgh. I stare at the old architecture, the people. It all looks so normal, like any medieval-born European city that I\u2019ve seen in books. Everything\u2019s made of dark, aged stone, and it\u2019s easy to imagine horses, carts, and people from times past wandering the streets and throwing buckets of pee out of the windows. If I didn\u2019t know evil lurked in the shadows, I\u2019d never guess it was here.</p><p>But it is here. Dormant for now, but just below the surface. And they\u2019re waiting for us. The Black Fallen. And after that short dream, I feel they know me. I\u2019d better watch my ass good.</p> <p>Peter takes a turn that I\u2019m pretty sure sets the Rover on two wheels, and my hand tightens against the strap once more. From the front seat Jake chuckles. My eyes follow the cars coming toward us as we drive on the opposite side of the road, the city\u2019s notorious black cabs littering the cobbled streets and zooming past us. My brain won\u2019t accept it yet. It\u2019s just weird to be on the other side of the road. Yet I have this insane desire to give it a try and take a drive myself. Maybe later. After we\u2019ve taken care of business.</p><p>Merchant storefronts line the street, most with their own quirky, painted signs hanging above the entranceways. A bakery. Yes! My stomach growls at the thought of what lies in the display cases. And there\u2019s a chip shop\u2014battered, fried fish and fried potato deliciousness. A corner market swings into view. As we pass by storefront after storefront, I wonder if any of them are the place Jake mentioned: a restaurant with take-out ice cream. Vittoria\u2019s. It\u2019s on my list of places to find first.</p><p>Jake has informed us that Gabriel, another WUP member and an immortal Pict like Darius, will meet us and introduce us to Old and New Town Edinburgh. Gabriel is WUP\u2019s Edinburgh contact and has been here since before the organization was even formed. He knows the streets, backward and forward. I hope I don\u2019t get lost. Savannah is easy. It\u2019s not a big city at all and is easily navigable via the town squares. I\u2019m thinking this will be a little tougher. I\u2019m ready, though. I like a challenge.</p><p>Peter turns onto a one-way cobbled drive and squeezes the Rover under a stone arch with an aged plate sign that says OLD TOLBOOTH WYND. I want to close my eyes, the Rover is so close to the sides of the archway. Instead, I glance behind us at the other WUP vehicles.</p><p>\u201cTight fit, aye?\u201d Old Peter says with a cackling laugh.</p> <p>I meet his twinkling gaze in the rearview mirror. \u201cYou barely squeaked by,\u201d I answer.</p><p>Peter and Jake both chuckle. Eli shakes his head and grins at me.</p><p>Once through the arch, the cobbled path opens up to a small, ancient, bricked courtyard flanked by a weathered wrought-iron double gate, which stands open. Through the gates the path winds around a stone fountain. I check out my immediate surroundings. Behind the fountain is an old, narrow, crescent-shaped stone building, three stories high and flagged with windows. Several steps rise to the red double doors.</p><p>\u201cThis used to be a school,\u201d Jake says, turning halfway in his seat to face me. His accent is odd. Not thick and modern, like Peter\u2019s, but older. \u201cGabriel has owned it for a verra long while. Since it closed, anyway.\u201d He turns back in his seat. \u201cNow \u2019tis WUP\u2019s active Scotland headquarters.\u201d</p><p>Peter stops the Rover and puts it in park, and I release the door and get out. A light mist falls, and the wind cuts through the courtyard, sharp and brisk, and stings my cheeks. I don\u2019t get cold much anymore, but this weather sinks straight to the bone. Shoving my hands deep into the pockets of my ankle-length black trench, which does at least keep my clothes dry, I study the fountain as I pass. It strikes me. I can\u2019t help but stop and stare. In the center is a derelict angel, wings hanging limply behind him, his hands raised and cupped over his mouth as if shouting something at the top of his lungs. Water spurts from his hands and washes over him into the fountain\u2019s pond. For some reason the statue chills me. Overhead, ravens screech, and as I glance up a swarm of black moves from one side of the crescent to the other as the birds fly in a flock. I notice the only sound I hear besides the water falling over the angel are the ravens\u2019 wings beating against the wind. They sound like harsh whispers. Freaky weird.</p><p>Then I sense it. My eyes dart all around me. Searching. Seeking.</p> <p>\u201cYou can feel it, aye?\u201d Jake asks close to me.</p><p>I meet his alarming green eyes. \u201cEvil,\u201d I say. It\u2019s so heavy. It feels like a wet, hot blanket draped over my body. While the city doesn\u2019t look it, there\u2019s definitely a feeling of it in the air.</p><p>\u201cPure evil, through and through,\u201d he says.</p><p>Our gazes lock, and there\u2019s an immediate understanding between us.</p><p>\u201cLucky for us, though,\u201d he says, \u201cwe\u2019re in the window.\u201d</p><p>The sound of car doors slamming silences my next question (What window?) and draws my attention back to my immediate surroundings. I turn to watch the other WUP members climb out of their vehicles. Darius is closest, and he walks toward me with long, purposeful strides. He\u2019s tall and muscular, with dark auburn hair pulled back at the nape of his neck. Beneath the dark shades lies a pair of disturbing, ancient amber eyes. He stops a foot away. \u201cRiley,\u201d he says, giving me a slight nod. \u201cReady to begin?\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s an air surrounding Darius that reeks of, I don\u2019t know. . . . mystical madness. \u201cI hope I can help.\u201d</p><p>A smile splits his face, revealing a dimple in his right cheek and straight white teeth. An amazing transformation, that smile. Truly handsome. Breathtakingly so. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p> <p>Eli is suddenly beside me. I\u2019m pretty tall for a woman, but Eli towers over me. He\u2019s just a big guy. He doesn\u2019t touch me. He simply stands. Protectively. Something we\u2019re still working on, I can assure you. Eli has been a little overprotective in the past, and for some of it, I\u2019m eternally grateful. But he knows I like to handle myself. \u201cDarius,\u201d Eli acknowledges. I resist jabbing my elbow into his gut.</p><p>Darius nods. \u201cDupr\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>Just then the double-hung, red-painted doors in the center of the Crescent swing open, and out steps Gabriel, along with Sydney Maspeth. Sydney starts down the steps first, making her way toward me. \u201cRiley. Eli,\u201d she says, smiling, and grabs my hands. \u201cSo glad you came. I was worried you\u2019d change your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a chance,\u201d I answer. Sydney is shorter than me, petite, blond, and tough as nails. Yet she moves with a particular grace that gives away her once-genteel lifestyle. In another life, she was a grade school teacher from the Carolinas. Then Sydney shed her Steel Magnolias persona and now she fights monsters. Other than her sick ability to read a dead language, she has no outstanding gifts of strength. But she\u2019s been trained by Gabriel and can fight like a banshee. She\u2019s still graceful as ever. And she\u2019s immortal. I guess that has pluses and minuses. Even dressed in black cargo pants, boots, and a heavy black turtleneck sweater, with her hair pulled into a ready-for-ass-kicking ponytail, Sydney moves as though she\u2019s floating, feet barely touching the ground. Even her hand motions are elegant. She might as well have on a tutu.</p><p>\u201cI see you survived Peter\u2019s driving,\u201d Sydney remarks.</p><p>\u201cBarely,\u201d I answer. \u201cHe\u2019s worse than, well, me.\u201d</p><p>Sydney laughs, and Gabriel is there beside her. \u201cMs. Poe,\u201d he nods, then meets Eli\u2019s gaze. \u201cDupr\u00e9.\u201d He extends a hand.</p><p>Eli takes it firmly and shakes. \u201cGabriel.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel, like Darius, has no family name. He is Eli\u2019s height and just as solid. He has long, straight black hair that he keeps pulled behind his neck in a silver clip. His eyes are a weird mercury color that can stop you in your tracks. I\u2019m not kidding\u2014literally freeze you where you stand. His face is cut and strong. Basically, he\u2019s pretty damn sexy.</p><p>His stare is almost as profound as Eli\u2019s.</p><p>I\u2019m punched in the arm. Without even turning around I know it\u2019s Noah.</p><p>He leans down to me. \u201cCan you feel it?\u201d he asks. Noah has sunkissed brown dreads, and pulls them back in a thick, untamed tail. Crazy silver eyes\u2014much like Gabriel\u2019s\u2014stare down at me.</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah, I can feel it,\u201d I answer, and I know he\u2019s referring to the same ominous evil blanketing the city that I had detected earlier.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s all go inside,\u201d Jake says, nodding toward the red doors. \u201cWe can get better acquainted with each other,\u201d he says, his eyes aimed directly on me, \u201cand with what\u2019s out there.\u201d With a quick glance to the sky, he jogs up the steps. I wonder what he\u2019s thinking. With Jake, you never know.</p><p>We all give one another an inquisitive look, then grab our bags from the trunks and move toward the Crescent building that will, for now, be our new home base. WUP headquarters.</p><p>The silver blades in my duffel bag, along with the very special potions concocted by Preacher and Estelle, my surrogate root doctor grandparents, rest as heavily on my shoulder as the solid weight of death I feel hanging in the air around me.</p><p>Inside the Crescent it\u2019s old, dark, and chilly despite the fire snapping in the fireplace. The air smells of charred wood and musty earth. Dim yellow light spills from several tarnished sconces embedded in the stone walls. They cast a hazy luminescence onto the wood-plank floors, and I notice my shadow stretches peculiarly when I move. Like my arms and legs are twice as long and my head distorted. Weird.</p><p>The foyer is empty. A row of old iron hooks, no higher than hip level, lines one wall of the entryway. Coat hooks, probably for the children who once went to school here. I don\u2019t know. Something kinda creepy about that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou may settle your belongings wherever you wish on the second floor,\u201d Gabriel says, his eyes sweeping over all of us. \u201cThere are several chambers to choose from. The third floor is primarily for training. We\u2019ll meet in the library for briefing in fifteen minutes,\u201d he says, then nods at Jake. \u201cAndorra?\u201d</p><p>They both exit the room.</p><p>Sydney steps forward. Her long blond ponytail brushes the middle of her back, and her dark clothes nearly merge with the shadows. \u201cAll right, guys. This way,\u201d she says, taking the lead up the wide wooden steps.</p> <p>Eli\u2019s hand rests on my lower back as we follow Sydney. His big body, although not warm, is comforting against mine. Noah, Darius, Victorian, Ginger, and Lucian follow behind us. The wood creaks and groans beneath our feet as we climb to the second floor. Sydney stops just a few feet past the landing. \u201cThese apartments were for the teachers of the Crescent School for Unruly Children,\u201d she says, wiggling her arched blond brows. \u201cTwo shared bathrooms: one for boys; one for girls,\u201d she says, pointing to the middle of the long corridor. \u201cAnd a large linen closet at the end.\u201d She points in that direction, too. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll leave you to it. Meet you in the library in fifteen.\u201d Sydney disappears down the steps and recedes into the darkness.</p><p>\u201cYou two,\u201d Noah says, looking at me and Eli. \u201cFor the sake of all of us, take the room at the very end.\u201d</p><p>I grin and shoulder my way past him. \u201cNo arguments there.\u201d Noah shakes his head as I pass.</p><p>With Eli\u2019s hand still at my back, we walk the long hallway to the last apartment. The corridor is dark, like the rest of the Crescent, and a long strip of faded green carpet stretches straight down the middle. The walls are of stained wood, so dark they appear black. Several old photographs in oval frames grace the wall in a straight line. Stone-faced women, their hair pulled back severely in tight buns, and men just as stony stare back. No smiles. All business. I swear, it looks like they\u2019re straight out of a horror movie.</p><p>Ginger and Lucian take the first apartment at the opposite end of the corridor from us. Vic is across the hall from them, Noah is one door down. Darius is next to us.</p> <p>I drop my duffel on the floor and take quick stock of our room. It\u2019s\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014dark. I move through the low light filtering in through the window to flip on a lamp perched on an old desk in the corner. The room is cast in a muted blond haze and illuminates a fireplace; a queen-sized bed, complete with heavy green curtains; a nightstand on either side of the bed, each with a lamp; and a tall armoire in the corner. A wooden chest is situated at the foot of the bed. I walk to the window and look out. It\u2019s gray and bleak, and my attention is drawn to the distraught angel in the center of the fountain. I stare at his face, chiseled in stone and chipped with age. His eyes are squeezed tightly shut as he cups his hands to his mouth.</p><p>Suddenly his features blur, becoming distorted, and I blink. When my eyes focus on his face, he\u2019s staring directly at me. A shot of adrenaline ripples through me.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Eli says, his lips brushing my neck.</p><p>I blink again, and the angel\u2019s face returns to its original stony state.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>\u201cRi?\u201d Eli says, then turns me around and stares down at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Instant concern flares in his cerulean eyes. The muscles in his jaw flinch. Like I said, he can be overprotective.</p> <p>I smile. \u201cNothing. Just getting used to this creepy place I guess.\u201d Not a lie. \u201cLet\u2019s go before Jake gets his knickers in a wad.\u201d</p><p>Eli stares a few seconds more, weighing what I say and determining if he believes me or not. He probably doesn\u2019t, and with good reason. I\u2019m not sure I believe myself at this point. \u201cAll right, Poe. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>A familiar feeling fills my insides as we leave the room and step back into the shadows of the corridor. It\u2019s a feeling that\u2019s becoming too much a part of my everyday life. I guess I have to just get used to it.</p><p>Dread.</p><p>Part Two</p><p>THE TEAM</p><p>I believe a man lost in the mazes of his own mind may imagine that he\u2019s anything.</p><p>\u2014Dr. Lloyd, The Wolf Man, 1941</p> <p>Already, this place is eating at me. The moment I stepped out into the air, evil seeped through the seemingly innocent stone and mist of Edinburgh. I don\u2019t know exactly what we face, but I know it\u2019s going to make killing vampires in Savannah look like playing with Barbie dolls. The Black Fallen? They\u2019re bad. Really, really bad.</p><p>\u2014Riley Poe</p><p>Unlike the bleak entryway and second-floor apartments, Gabriel\u2019s library is nothing short of stylish. A massive room with wall-to-wall mahogany shelves lined with volumes and volumes of books. A colossal fireplace that takes up nearly a whole wall. And in front of the crackling fire, a long, dark leather sofa, love seat, and several chairs. A chandelier made of intertwined stag antlers dangles overhead. Several table and floor lamps with Victorian-era shades of claret, green, and cream add to the soft glow from the fireplace. As we all file in, I notice Jake and Gabriel near the hearth, their dark heads together, deep in conversation. Simultaneously they both glance up and step forward.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d Jake says, nodding to the seating before the fireplace.</p><p>We all do. Noah plops down on the sofa beside me, and on my other side, Eli. Darius takes a chair; Victorian takes another. Ginger and Lucian take the love seat. Sydney is already positioned in the overstuffed leather chair closest to the hearth. I take notice of my companions. It still floors me to know what really, truly exists in our world. I call them otherbeings, for lack of a better term. And they are beings, with feelings. Tempers. Attitudes. But they\u2019re also vampires. Werewolves. Immortals. And then there\u2019s me\u2014whatever the hell I am. I guess I fall into a weird, in-between category. Not sure yet if I like that or not, but there\u2019s no changing it. It is what it is.</p><p>\u201cAs you all know, we\u2019re here to deal with the Black Fallen,\u201d Jake says. My eyes cut to Eli. We\u2019re both thinking the same thing: this guy doesn\u2019t waste time. Jake crosses his arms over his chest and his eyes sweep over us with a hard gaze. \u201cThe Black Fallen are angels engulfed in the darkest of magic. They\u2019re obsessed, powerful, and completely undetectable. They\u2019ve zero conscience. They move among humans as one of them, and only another fallen one can recognize them straight away. They\u2019re from an ancient realm of holy and unholy, if you believe in that sort of thing. And they\u2019ll not stop until they have what they desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwell,\u201d Noah says, rubbing his hands together. \u201cI love a challenge.\u201d</p><p>I turn my head to look at him. He returns my stare. \u201cWhat?\u201d he says. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you may change your mind soon enough, Miles,\u201d continues Jake. \u201cNo matter how powerful you are, there\u2019s always something out there more powerful than you.\u201d He looks directly at Eli. \u201cFor a vampire, it\u2019s the Black Fallen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are they here?\u201d Ginger asks.</p><p>\u201cAnd what do they want?\u201d Lucian adds.</p><p>\u201cDarius will brief you on their history,\u201d Jake asks. \u201cHe\u2019s more knowledgeable about the matter.\u201d</p><p>Darius takes up the story. \u201cCenturies ago, my brethren and I were forced to destroy another sect of druids called the Celtae. They\u2019d stolen an ancient tome of magic called the Seiagh, filled with the most potent and powerful of evil spells. Dangerous not only to themselves, but to mankind. It poisoned their minds, and they had begun using it for their own personal gain. For money. Riches. Sex. Power. Only later did we realize they had stolen it from the Black Fallen. The Seiagh\u2019s power was legend. It needed to be destroyed.\u201d He takes a breath in. \u201cLittle did we know that the Celtae had hidden it so elaborately that even we wouldn\u2019t be able to find it. The bloody thing is masked with magic. \u2019Tis been nearly an impossible task to find it. Until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why here and why now?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhy have the Fallen suddenly shown up seeking it in Edinburgh?\u201d</p><p>Darius meets my questioning gaze with intense amber eyes. \u201cA perfect example of Jake\u2019s earlier words,\u201d he says solemnly. \u201cThere are always others more powerful than you. The Celtae, whilst not exactly more powerful, were cunning. And determined.\u201d He rubs his jaw with his hand. \u201cThey used magic from the Seiagh to conceal it from the Fallen, yet were so convinced they could overcome their deaths and reclaim the book, they created an intricate path, filled with riddles and clues, to the Seiagh\u2019s location. My brethren and I knew then that the Seiagh would need protecting, to keep others from finding it. We appointed our own bloodline as these protectors. Sacrificed peaceful eternity in order to guard the book and make sure it never, ever reached the hands of others.\u201d He sighs, and glances at Sydney Maspeth. \u201cWe then appointed an Archivist\u2014one who, centuries after the book had been gone, would be the only one left who could read the ancient language. That would be Sydney, and she\u2019s the only Archivist in existence. Once the Seiagh is located, her job is to read the one ancient spell that will destroy the book itself.\u201d</p><p>I gaze at Sydney, who merely stares back at me. So her destiny had been decided centuries before she was even born. Damn. Maybe all of ours were.</p><p>\u201cAnd the Black Fallen?\u201d Eli asks beside me.</p><p>\u201cCall it . . . prophecy. They are in the position to know things of a higher power. They created the Seiagh. The spells within gave them their power on Earth. It was stolen from them. They know its capabilities. But they could not undo the spells keeping the book masked.\u201d He again glances at Sydney. \u201cBut they were very much aware of when the Seiagh would reappear: with the appearance of the Archivist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo now they\u2019re just . . . waiting?\u201d asks Victorian.</p><p>Darius shakes his head. \u201cNot exactly. For as powerful as they are, they do have a weakness. In order to maintain their human form, they must find souls to replenish their unholy forms.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cWithout them, the Fallen will disintegrate in a matter of time. They are not meant to exist on this plane.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My head is spinning. So much to take in and remember. So much stuff to learn about otherbeings. So many rules. Who makes up all these rules anyway?</p><p>\u201cDepends on what you believe in,\u201d Jake answers my thoughts. \u201cWhere matters of Heaven and Hell are concerned, well, I\u2019m sure you know who makes those rules up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do the Fallen manage to get willing participants to just give up their souls?\u201d asks Noah. He leans forward, muscular forearms resting on his knees. \u201cDo they have mind control?\u201d</p> <p>Darius answers. \u201cYes. But they have to use a medium to lure their victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d asks Lucian.</p><p>\u201cThe Jod\u00eds,\u201d replies Darius. His amber gaze scans the team. \u201cJod\u00eds are demonlike beings created by the Fallen. A concocted being pulled straight from the pages of the Seiagh itself. They\u2019re made to appear human, but they\u2019re anything but. They are . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHideous,\u201d I answer.</p><p>All eyes turn to me.</p> <p>Eli\u2019s hand slides over my lap and his fingers lace through mine. He squeezes. \u201cRiley experienced a vision through Sydney\u2019s eyes once before,\u201d he clarifies.</p><p>\u201cIt can be overwhelming,\u201d Jake says, as if reading my mind. Then he looks pointedly at me. \u201cBut I wouldna have chosen you, or the others, had you not been capable of comprehending. As for the souls . . . the Jod\u00eds take the victim\u2019s heart. Literally. Take it straight to the Fallen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d I say, and I say it again to myself. Damn. \u201cThat\u2019s brutal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. It is.\u201d</p><p>I meet Jake\u2019s gaze. \u201cI can handle it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes smile. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe only way to kill a Jod\u00eds or a Black Fallen is by beheading them,\u201d Gabriel announces.</p><p>I groan out loud.</p><p>Several chuckles fill the room.</p><p>\u201cNot to worry,\u201d Gabriel adds. \u201cPart of your training will be on the handling of a broadsword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the other part of training?\u201d Noah asks, all too excitedly.</p><p>\u201cHow to keep it concealed,\u201d Sydney finishes. \u201cNot as easy as you might think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to the tome,\u201d Darius continues. \u201cIn order to find the Seiagh and vanquish it forever, there are three ancient relics that must be found. Before the Celtae were killed we . . . extracted some information from them. Not everything, but enough.\u201d</p><p>I shudder to think of what that extraction consisted of. Torture. The Celtae must\u2019ve been some hard asses.</p> <p>Darius gives me a slight nod, proving my assumption. \u201cEach is encrypted with a verse that, when all three are combined, will lead to the physical location of the dark tome. Once the tome is found, only Sydney\u2014and the Black Fallen\u2014can read the incantations. There is only one that will disintegrate the Seiagh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, basically, it\u2019s a race to get the book first,\u201d Victorian says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we simply kill the Fallen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as the Seiagh exists, mankind is in danger. It has to be destroyed, as well as the Fallen,\u201d Gabriel says. \u201cUnfortunately, we will have to lure them. And they want Ms. Maspeth almost as badly as they want the Seiagh.\u201d</p><p>Jake crosses his arms over his chest. \u201cWe\u2019ve become more than just slayers of otherworldly beings.\u201d He sweeps us all with a stealthy glance. \u201cWe have to keep as many innocents alive as possible. And Ms. Poe has certain . . . gifts no one else possesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Noah says. \u201cLike she can fight like unholy Hell? And she\u2019s mean as shit?\u201d</p><p>I grab a piece of thigh muscle through Noah\u2019s jeans and pinch. Hard.</p><p>His face actually turns red.</p><p>\u201cShe does have dominant mind control now,\u201d Eli says. His voice is low, tinged with unease. \u201cLet me guess. She\u2019s going to be used as bait.\u201d He glances down at me. \u201cShe\u2019ll be more than up for it, unfortunately.\u201d</p><p>Jake rubs his jaw. \u201cHer skills, aye, they\u2019ll certainly come in handy. Her mind control is indeed a major factor, as well. We do have one small advantage,\u201d he continues. \u201cWhatever spell they use to create the Jod\u00eds exhausts them. It takes three to four consecutive days for the Fallen to regenerate. We know this to be accurate, as the last two batches of Jod\u00eds Gabriel and Sydney have vanquished did not regenerate until the appropriate amount of time had passed.\u201d</p><p>Sydney nods. \u201cThe spell drains the Black Fallen, so it must be a pretty potent one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Jake continues. \u201cThe Fallen have names.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cCanthor. Danu. And the youngest, Athios. Two have been condemned for some time. But we know very little about the youngest one, Athios.\u201d</p><p>I have to wonder which of the three appeared in my dream earlier.</p><p>\u201cSo, how are we to find them?\u201d Ginger asks. \u201cThey\u2019re undetectable, right?\u201d</p><p>Jake, Gabriel, and Darius share a look, then turn their stares to me. \u201cThat\u2019s where Ms. Poe comes in,\u201d Gabriel says.</p><p>\u201cWe have to infiltrate their circle,\u201d Jake continues. \u201cThey might be undetectable to look upon and pick out of a crowd,\u201d he says. \u201cAt first. But then, so are we.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir desires and mannerisms are predictable,\u201d Darius states. \u201cThey are not unlike other fallen angels. They crave power. Sex. They\u2019re posh. And they like . . . flashy things. Plus there\u2019s a chance Riley may be able to actually hear them, if she concentrates, as she has remarkable hearing and a sense of smell that far exceeds even her vampire benefactors.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Noah. \u201cIt\u2019s true. I do.\u201d</p><p>Noah grins.</p><p>\u201cAnd they don\u2019t like to get their hands dirty,\u201d Jake clarifies. \u201cIt\u2019s one reason why they\u2019ve created the Jod\u00eds.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cTo bring the souls to them.\u201d</p><p>I draw a deep breath, push it out slowly between my teeth. \u201cAre the Jod\u00eds detectable?\u201d</p><p>Darius nods. \u201cAye. Their pupils aren\u2019t normal. They\u2019re vertical.\u201d</p><p>I stare back. \u201cSo we have to be close enough to see their pupils before taking them out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sydney says. \u201cThey cannot tolerate the daylight. And they have a certain scent only another otherbeing can detect. They stink to high Heaven.\u201d</p><p>My brain twists at all that\u2019s been said. So much to know, so much to understand.</p><p>\u201cTaking out newlings is much easier,\u201d I say under my breath. Just months ago the extent of my dealings with the paranormal extended to slaying newly created vampires. I could tell this would be a lot more challenging.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ll begin training right away,\u201d Jake says. \u201cYou\u2019ll break into groups. Darius, Gabriel, and I will enlighten you on the use of a broadsword. We\u2019ve a couple of specialists paying us a visit later on. Quite proficient in the use of a sword, these two. You\u2019ll appreciate their expertise.\u201d</p><p>Beside me, Noah rubs his hands together in anticipation. \u201cI love swords.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I say, standing. My insides are already taut with anticipation. \u201cLet\u2019s get at it, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me emphasize one thing. For all we know, the Fallen have found a way to overcome their regeneration time. I don\u2019t trust their window, or them,\u201d Jake adds. \u201cIt\u2019s safer to assume they\u2019re strengthened now, creating more Jod\u00eds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means more innocent kills,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, yes. Sydney and Gabriel just disposed of the last of them two days ago. But they\u2019re fast and difficult to spot, especially after they\u2019ve been newly created. Perhaps with more of us we can eliminate the number of innocent victims. We\u2019ll spend what free time we have now to familiarize you with Edinburgh and her fishbone streets, closes and wynds, as well as honing your skills. We\u2019ll break to eat first,\u201d Jake says, then scans the group. \u201cFor those who eat food, the kitchen is fully stocked, or there\u2019s a chippy just out the gates of the Crescent on Canongate, across the street. Bene\u2019s Fish and Chips. Great takeaway. Plus numerous other establishments along the Mile. For those who prefer to drink,\u201d he says with a grin, \u201cyours will be in the red refrigerator. Courtesy of Preacher. There is a month\u2019s supply. Let\u2019s meet upstairs in thirty minutes. And if you go out, watch your backs.\u201d</p><p>As I fix my gaze on Darius, Jake, and Gabriel, I have a feeling training with three ancient Celtic immortals will be slightly different than hand-to-hand fighting with the Dupr\u00e9 family.</p><p>Part Three</p><p>SKILLS DAY</p><p>In London there is a man who screams when the church bells ring.</p><p>\u2014H. P. Lovecraft, \u201cThe Descendant\u201d</p><p>I already can see a sisterhood forming with Riley, and I\u2019m glad. Grateful. I\u2019ve been feeling so alone in all this, like the only female thrown into a world of evil chaotic males. Well, Darius and Gabriel are far from evil, but you get my drift. It\u2019s nice to have another female in the mix. Ginger, too, although she\u2019s relatively new to the team. I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re entirely aware of what\u2019s coming, the black storm of evil that\u2019s descending upon Edinburgh. But they will. And I can tell we are all better off having Riley on our team.</p><p>\u2014Sydney Maspeth</p><p>Bene\u2019s proves to be a potential favorite place to eat in Edinburgh. Just enough room in the small take-out spot to step inside, drool over the selection of foods (excluding haggis\u2014um, no, thank you), give your order, and either step back outside or hug the wall and wait. The guys behind the counter were superfriendly and fast. Both only briefly glimpsed at my inked wings and then continued on with their cheerful, brogue-tinged conversation. I like that, and it makes me think Edinburgh is as diverse as any other city; even the folks at Bene\u2019s aren\u2019t surprised by a girl with tattooed black wings on her face. I haven\u2019t explored other eateries yet, but, man\u2014Bene\u2019s big batter-fried slabs of haddock, and mountain of chips dowsed in malt vinegar and some weird-looking but delicious brown sauce? Let\u2019s just say the voracious appetite that is now part of my Frankenstein-like genetic makeup overdid itself. I ate like a freaking hog. And I\u2019m feeling it. I almost want to let out the top two buttons on my jeans. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was so good.</p><p>We\u2019re getting ready to start training with the swords, and I don\u2019t want to be impaled because I can\u2019t breathe from too much Bene\u2019s. I leave Eli, who is talking to Jake about the layout of Edinburgh, in the kitchen and hurry through the front sitting room, where Lucian and Ginger are talking to Victorian, and bound up the steps to the second floor. Jogging to the end of the corridor, I slip into my and Eli\u2019s room, cross over to my duffel on the floor where I dropped it earlier, throw it onto the bed, and start rifling through it. I find a tie for my hair and pull it back into a ponytail. Next, a pair of black Lycra pants. I toe off my boots, unbutton my jeans, and slide them over my hips. Kicking them into a pile, I pull on the Lycra and fish in my duffel for a shirt. Finding a black tank top, I grab the hem of my sweater and pull it over my head.</p><p>\u201cHow long did it take to ink that dragon onto your back?\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t jump in surprise, nor do I snap around and cover myself. My modesty went out the window years ago. \u201cI heard you cracking your knuckles as you left your room, Noah Miles,\u201d I say. I pull the tank over my head and turn around. \u201cYou don\u2019t think you can possibly sneak up on me. Do you, bro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. But I don\u2019t see how you can sneak up on anyone, woman. I can hear the fish and chips sloshing around in your gut,\u201d Noah says. He\u2019s leaning against the doorframe of my room, arms crossed over his chest, grinning. Clad in a pair of black running pants and a plain white T-shirt, he looks about as average as any guy in a gym. Well, except for his extraordinary good looks. Painfully good, even.</p><p>He grins. \u201cSo. How long?\u201d</p><p>I ignore the fact that he randomly reads my thoughts any time he wants. \u201cIt took several sittings, maybe four to five hours each,\u201d I answer. \u201cYou outline first, then once it heals, maybe in three to four weeks, the color is added.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou miss it?\u201d Noah adds. He walks over, lifts one of my bare arms, and studies the intricate dragon\u2019s tail winding from shoulder to fingertip.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say. \u201cWhy\u2014you want one?\u201d I grin at him.</p><p>Noah\u2019s head is bent over my forearm. \u201cMaybe,\u201d he says, lowers my arm, and looks at me. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to keep covered while we\u2019re here,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Grabbing my black Nikes from my bag, I pull them on. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Andorra says, you need to draw as little attention to yourself as possible,\u201d Noah says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Savannah, babe. Your ink sticks out. Draws unwanted attention you don\u2019t want to have to deal with. Locals.\u201d With a knuckle, he grazes the wings at my eye. \u201cAnd, yeah, I know you can handle yourself.\u201d</p><p>He does, too. I like that about Noah. He has my back if I need it, but I seriously have to need it before he jumps in to cover me. He respects my abilities. Gotta love that about a three-hundred-year-old vampire. With dreads. And, maybe he\u2019s right. Although the guys at Bene\u2019s accept my body art, I definitely don\u2019t want to stick out.</p><p>\u201cAnd my alluring silver eyes, don\u2019t forget,\u201d he adds, batting his long lashes. Infiltrating my thoughts. Again.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous, Noah,\u201d I say, and I can\u2019t help but smiling at him. He\u2019s such a freaking kid. Yet . . . to see him change, to see his fangs drop, and to see him fight? Breathtakingly beautiful. I know that makes me sound a little sick, and I guess I am. I punch his arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Noah and I walk out of the room together and head down the corridor.</p><p>\u201cThis place is a little creepy. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d he says as we near the steps. \u201cThere\u2019s something, I don\u2019t know, weird about the idea of little unruly schoolkids that freaks me out.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head as we jog up the steps to the third-floor training area. \u201cYeah, I agree. Little pale-skinned Victorian-era kids, wearing black dresses and stockings and button-up boots, is definitely creepy,\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cSlipping around corners, talking in hushed whispers, and just being . . . weird,\u201d Noah adds. \u201cKids,\u201d he says with a shudder.</p><p>We both chuckle as we hit the third-floor landing. Halfway down the corridor is an open set of dark double doors. We step through, and Jake, who is standing close by, gives me a grin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve reason to suspect the children once housed here were creepy,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were\u201d\u2014he strokes his chin\u2014\u201cextraordinary, one might say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtraordinary?\u201d I ask. The others in the room\u2014Ginger, Lucian, Victorian, Noah, and Eli\u2014all turn to listen.</p> <p>\u201cAye,\u201d he continues. \u201cAll had exceptional gifts. Levitation. Mind reading. Transversing space. Just to name a few. Unfortunately, though, their families and the general public of Edinburgh thought they were mad,\u201d he says, and looks at me. \u201cInsane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re staying in an old Victorian-era children\u2019s insane asylum?\u201d Noah asks. He looks at me. \u201cI knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chamber you\u2019re residing in, Noah, once belonged to one Professor Gallagher,\u201d Jake says.</p><p>Noah nods. \u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was found dead, huddled against the wall near your bed,\u201d Jake adds. \u201cAn expression of terror frozen onto his weathered face and one hand held up in defense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other hand?\u201d Noah prods, clearly enjoying Jake\u2019s tale.</p><p>Jake\u2019s gaze narrows. \u201cClutching his rosary.\u201d</p><p>Noah nods. \u201cI\u2019ve caused a similar response in folks myself a time or two, Andorra.\u201d He eyes me and winks. \u201cBefore I became a guardian, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I just look at him sideways. \u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe professor was literally frightened to death,\u201d Jake continues. \u201cBy one of his pupils.\u201d He smiles. \u201cLittle Lily Johnson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, Lily,\u201d Gabriel says as he enters the dojo. He\u2019s wearing black martial arts pants and tunic tied with a black belt. The man is huge\u2014nearly larger than Eli. And all that long, straight black hair clasped at the nape and hanging down his back. Impressive, to say the very least.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Lily?\u201d Noah asks.</p><p>Gabriel almost smiles. \u201cLet\u2019s just say if you encounter her, dunna look her in the eye.\u201d</p><p>I stare at Gabriel, and he lifts one brow. I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s joking or not. At this point I\u2019ll believe anything. Freaky little Victorian Lily equals no eye contact. Besides. Anyone who bears the name Little Lily Johnson? Shudder.</p><p>Now we\u2019re all gathered in the dojo. A large, spread-out room the size of at least four bedchambers with windows lining the wall and facing the courtyard. Outside it\u2019s gray, dreary, and bleak. It looks cold. Fortunately, I don\u2019t feel temperature the way I used to, so I\u2019m rarely either hot or cold. The floor is covered with a dark gray padded mat, pretty much like the one in the Dupr\u00e9s dojo. Along one wall there\u2019s a wooden stand containing a myriad of swords. Big ones. Sharp ones.</p><p>Silver ones.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to break off into groups,\u201d Jake says. He looks at Gabriel, then at Darius, who\u2019s just entered the dojo. \u201cBut before we start with the blades,\u201d he scans us all with an inspective gaze, \u201cwe\u2019re going to see what other skills we all have combined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want us to show off our tricks?\u201d Victorian asks sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all going to show off our tricks,\u201d Jake replies. \u201cTwo at a time. Let\u2019s start with . . .\u201d He studies each of us. \u201cThe wolves.\u201d</p><p>Without a word, all of us except Gabriel back against the wall as Lucian and Ginger take the center of the room. Lucian looks at Gabriel. \u201cHuman or lupine?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I find that very interesting.</p><p>\u201cOne at a time,\u201d Gabriel instructs, his face expressionless. In his hands is a pair of long, wooden training sticks, probably four feet in length. He tosses one to Ginger and she catches it. \u201cMs. Slater first. Human.\u201d</p><p>Ginger, wearing a pair of navy blue training pants with double white stripes up the sides and a gray V-neck T-shirt tightens her grip on the stick and moves toward Gabriel. Her face is drawn, intense, and she is concentrating heavily. Her focus is solely on Gabriel. Eyes frozen to his. Without hesitation, she moves in.</p><p>Ginger Slater is all of five feet, three inches. Maybe 115 pounds soaking wet, with all of her clothes on. She looks like a porcelain doll; her features are so sweet, skin blemish free. Even her voice is soft. Confident, yet soft. She reminds me of the sweet-spoken female cop in that old comedy Police Academy. Seemingly so . . . innocent. Possibly even a pushover. Easy to overtake, especially by a big man\u2014or a big otherbeing, without a doubt. Gabriel is both and he towers over her, by more than a foot, and outweighs her by God knows what.</p><p>She moves like lightning.</p><p>It proves to be one of many advantages.</p><p>Showing no fear and a face lined with determination, Ginger strikes Gabriel first. Their training sticks collide with repetitive, echoing clacking as they pose offense and defense. I study Gabriel\u2019s movements hard, watching everything closely. I\u2019m having a difficult time deciding whether he\u2019s working to keep Ginger\u2019s stick from knocking him in the head or if he\u2019s simply toying with her. As usual, his features are stoic and stony.</p><p>Ginger\u2019s expression is . . . mean. I can\u2019t think of another adjective for it. She looks mean as Hell. But even mean can\u2019t fend off a six-foot-three-inch, two-hundred-plus-pound immortal from charging you and throwing you against the wall. I continue to watch her. Ginger\u2019s hands grip the stick tightly, and the little muscles in her biceps tighten with each strike she makes on Gabriel. She reflects each of his strikes, too. I glance at Lucian, and a satisfied smile pulls at his lips. He looks at me and nods proudly.</p><p>\u201cLupine,\u201d Gabriel simply says.</p><p>My eyes are glued to Ginger, because even with all the extraordinary things I\u2019ve seen in the past several months with vampires, I\u2019m anxious to see another otherbeing. My mind now logically accepts things like vampires, werewolves, immortals, humans with tendencies. I know them to exist. Yet there\u2019s a morbid part of me that has to see it in action first. Wants to see it. My insides tighten with anticipation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The fighting stick drops from Ginger\u2019s hands. Before it even hits the mat, it\u2019s happened. Her human form blurs, movement shifts like a breeze wisping through a gauze curtain, and she drops to all fours. When my vision focuses, she is a reddish-colored wolf. She launches at Gabriel, paws to chest, jaws wide open and angled over his throat, and has him pinned to the mat in mere seconds.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Noah says, admiration clearly in his voice. \u201cThat is sick, my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui,\u201d agrees Eli. Whenever he slips into French, I know he\u2019s in deep with whatever he\u2019s concentrating on. Our gazes meet, and he grins at me. I return it. Ginger will be a total asset to the team.</p> <p>Gabriel\u2019s expression remains remarkably unreadable. \u201cWell done,\u201d he says, looking Ginger the wolf directly in the eye. She sort of bows her scruffy head and backs off of him. Turning her head toward Lucian, he smiles and nods toward the doorway. Ginger takes off at a trot.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s she going?\u201d Noah asks.</p><p>Lucian glances over at Noah. \u201cDo you see that pile of clothes on the mat?\u201d</p><p>We all glance down. Damn. Even I hadn\u2019t noticed. Sure enough, there lay the Nikes, navy blue training pants, and Ginger\u2019s T-shirt. Along with a bra and undies.</p><p>Lucian smiles. \u201cShe\u2019s modest.\u201d He walks over and scoops them up. \u201cBe right back.\u201d He jogs out of the dojo.</p> <p>Gabriel is up now and scanning the room. \u201cQuite an advantage, those two,\u201d he says, his gaze landing on Jake\u2019s. \u201cShe could have snapped my head off with those jaws.\u201d</p><p>Jake looks at Gabriel and grins. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>In my head, I\u2019m wondering why, if they have so much vampire power and wolf power, WUP needs my help. The vampires can read minds, and so can the immortals. They can all fight like insane ultimate fighters, and the wolves can bite off heads. Why do they need me?</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Darius says, reading my mind and pinning me with a pointed look. \u201cYou are more than just a fighting human, Riley. Your mind control alone is a challenge any otherbeing will have difficulty warding off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVictorian has it,\u201d I say, glancing at Vic.</p><p>\u201cNot to your extent,\u201d Eli adds. \u201cWe all saw what you did to his brother, Valerian. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d</p> <p>I glance at Jake. His chiseled jaw tightens as he returns my stare. \u201cWe did,\u201d he answers. \u201cInvaluable.\u201d</p><p>Oh, great. My mind powers of coercion make me a high commodity in the otherbeing world. Fantastic. Always knew I\u2019d be good for something.</p><p>At least five chuckles fill the dojo. Freaking mind readers.</p><p>Don\u2019t be silly. You\u2019re good for many, many things to me, soon-to-be Mrs. Dupr\u00e9.</p><p>I shoot a glance at Eli, who is merely staring at me. One dark brow rises.</p><p>I fight a smile and shake my head.</p><p>Just then, Ginger and Lucian step back into the dojo, and the sparring continues.</p><p>I soon see that Gabriel was, in fact, holding back a little with Ginger. I knew it. Although I do think she could\u2019ve probably rendered him headless if they weren\u2019t on the same team. But when Gabriel and Lucian spar, it\u2019s a little more intense. They spar in human form for only a few moments\u2014long enough for us all to see Lucian not only can handle his own, but also watch our backs. Then he morphs into his wolf form and, man, it\u2019s . . . breathtaking to watch. Midnight black, he lunges straight at Gabriel, and Gabriel hurls him across the dojo. All the way across it. My mouth drops open. Literally. I feel a finger at my jaw as Eli gently forces my mouth shut.</p> <p>Noah and Darius spar. Darius, shirtless and a six-pack you could thump a penny off of, amazes me almost as much as Noah does. Both fight in martial arts form, both equally strong. Only Noah can jump. Abnormally high. Moves fast as lightning. Something extremely sexy about a man who can kick so high, his legs are nearly split in half, like scissors.</p><p>Noah throws me a grin. Darius takes him out. Flat-out. On-his-back, on-the-mat out.</p><p>Next, Victorian and Jake go at it. Both are vampires, and both are exquisite fighters. Jake is a lot older than Vic, though, and his experience shows. Each throws the other across the dojo, and each leaps high into the rafters above. And despite Victorian\u2019s looks\u2014he is almost painfully beautiful, in a polished, aristocratic way\u2014he can morph into one freaky-ass, scary vamp. And there\u2019s not a single bone in his bloodless body that is scared of anything or anyone. Neither morph, though, but rather keep to hand-to-hand combat. Both are pretty intriguing, to say the least.</p><p>Sydney and Gabriel take the center floor next, and Gabriel shows Syd no mercy. I mean zero. He charges her relentlessly, and without flinching or shying away\u2014not even once\u2014Sydney charges back. She, like Ginger, is petite and blond, and while not as innocent-looking as Ginger, she does move with a certain grace that is pretty interesting to watch. She lacks the sweetness Ginger still has, too. Like me. Syd is rough around the edges, yet cultured. Classy.</p><p>And she can kick some immortal ass, if I ever saw it.</p><p>Gabriel grabs Sydney, her back to his front, and has a choke hold around her neck. I swear, I blink, and when I focus, big-ass Gabriel is flying over Sydney\u2019s narrow little shoulders. Gabriel lands on the mat with such force, I feel the floor shudder beneath my feet.</p><p>The look on Sydney\u2019s face as she looks down at her mentor is one of smugness. Pride. Serious accomplishment.</p><p>Totally priceless.</p><p>Next up, Eli and Darius. Now, I\u2019m completely biased when I say Eligius Dupr\u00e9 is a vision of beauty when he is in the heat of battle. Well, maybe not. He\u2019s the sexiest otherbeing alive, and of that I\u2019m 100 percent positive. But he\u2019s a machine when he fights. And he\u2019s totally terrifying when he morphs. He and Darius are apt opponents, and they spar for several moments before either is struck. With my eyes I follow Eli\u2019s movements, watch his muscles tighten when he moves, and once I focus on his face, I\u2019m lost. Such fierce intensity, vigorous determination. He makes sort of a . . . I don\u2019t know, a growling face. Teeth bared, brows drawn. He looks vicious.</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d Jake says, calling a halt to Eli and Darius. The WUP leader smiles at me, and it\u2019s not a pleasant, welcoming, friendly smile. Rather, it\u2019s one of . . . anticipation. \u201cYou\u2019re with me, girl.\u201d</p><p>Eli walks by me, leans down, and kisses my cheek, and at the same time slaps me on the ass. \u201cGo get \u2019em, Neo,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>I grin. \u201cFlattery will get you everywhere,\u201d I answer. He\u2019s referring to my Matrix-like fighting skills, no doubt. I have to admit, my new powers are freeing. It\u2019s hilarious to think I\u2019ve traded my thigh-high leather spiked boots, fishnet hose, and plaid miniskirt for Lycra and Nikes. But I have.</p><p>Eli grins, and I continue on to the center of the mat. Jake is waiting. He wears a T-shirt and black training pants and is barefoot. His long black hair is pulled back. With his green-eyed gaze, he studies me as I move. Follows my every step. I take in everything about him; weigh him as an opponent in as little time as necessary. I profile him, so to speak. I focus solely on Jake. I block out everything, everyone in the room, and channel all of my thoughts, my senses on just him. The room blurs. Only Jake is crystal-clear in my vision. Everything he does, voluntarily, involuntarily, is magnified. He blinks once, and I hear his lashes brush his cheek. Jake\u2019s body relaxes. His muscles flex at his jaw. His nostrils flare as I draw closer to him. Head slightly lowers. Fingers flex. Then his body leans ever so slightly toward me and goes rigid.</p><p>Just as he lunges, I leap upward and over him, landing soundly and in a crouching position behind him. Jake whips around and meets my gaze.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d he says, his voice low, even. \u201cVerra nice\u2014\u201d</p><p>I dive toward him and have my legs wrapped around his neck, and we\u2019re falling to the mat before he finishes his sentence. We both hit with a thud. Jake\u2019s trapped in my leg lock.</p><p>Eli lets out a whistle. I know it\u2019s Eli because, well, I know his whistle. I don\u2019t spare him a glance, though, because despite my little victory over Jake, I don\u2019t trust him for a second.</p><p>I\u2019m on my back in less than a second. Jake is straddling me, my arms pinned above my head. Just that fast, it happens. The room tilts; my vision blurs even as I stare up into his face. A smile touches Jake\u2019s lips, and I know he knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. My new gift. The one I can\u2019t quite control yet.</p><p>I am Jake . . .</p><p>The night is verra dark, and cast in an insipid flush by a thumbnail moon. Shadows extend in awkward lengths along the barren road. It\u2019s damn cold outside, and the stark moors are no barrier for the harsh Highland winds. His horse stamps against the gales, mayhap anxious to reach a nice barn filled with hay. Even through the thick, coarse wool of breeches and a heavy coat, the chill seeps deep, through each bloody layer, far into his bones. He canna recall the last time he was warm. Verra likely \u2019tis when he last lay next to his wife. Elizabeth\u2019s image comes to mind, her long midnight hair trailin\u2019 over skin so pure and white it nearly glows. Her eyes, large and green, are filled wi\u2019 love for him and their three bairns. \u2019Tis the image that keeps him goin\u2019. Keeps him warm enough.</p><p>He\u2019s no\u2019 far from home\u2014mayhap a league, just over the next hillock. Jake nudges his mount onward, and they pick up speed. At once he sees a red-orange hue plumin\u2019 in a flickering cloud. Far in the distance, in the direction of his home. On the next gust of wind, the acrid scent of smoke reaches his nostrils. His insides freeze and his heart leaps. They\u2019ve no neighbors. Jesus Christ. It has tae be their home.</p><p>Jake sinks his knees into his horse\u2019s sides and tears across the moors. Fear clasps his insides. Closer, closer, they grow, and \u2019tis only when they\u2019re no more than a score of minutes away that he\u2019s swept off his horse.</p><p>Only then does he hear them.</p><p>They\u2019re all around. They\u2019re above.</p><p>Stunned only for a moment, Jake pushes hard to his feet. His heart pounds against his ribs, and it\u2019s then the screams reach his ears. These . . . men\u2014there are five in all\u2014they stand round him, circling. He breaks hard and tries tae run past them, toward his family, his burning house. One grabs his shoulder and flings him harshly tae the ground. The air whooshes from his lungs. He\u2019s lying on his back when the one who flung him walks toward him, placing a booted foot upon his chest. Young, smaller than Jake, and with the palest of skin, his gaze holds and locks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re already dead,\u201d he says bluntly.</p><p>\u201cNay!\u201d Jake forces the words out of his mouth. He tries to shove the foot off his chest, but he can\u2019t budge it.</p><p>The man laughs. \u201cNo need to try heroics. It won\u2019t work for you\u201d\u2014he glances off toward Jake\u2019s home\u2014\u201cor for them.\u201d</p> <p>Jake growls. \u201cYou killed them!\u201d he shouts at the top of his lungs. Still, he can\u2019t move. Grief and anger choke his words. \u201cWhy?\u201d He thrashes about, trying tae remove the man\u2019s foot. \u201cI\u2019ve got tae get them!\u201d Jake yells.</p><p>\u201cOh yes,\u201d another, in the shadow, says. \u201cHe\u2019ll be quite an addition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d yet another agrees. \u201cHis size alone makes him worthy.\u201d</p><p>All at once, the men disappear, save the one pinning him to the ground, and a cacophony of beating wings fills the night air. Jake canna tell if \u2019tis the wind or if they\u2019re flyin\u2019. They canna be flyin\u2019. They\u2019re just men. . . .</p><p>\u201cAh, good man, we\u2019re much, much more than mere men,\u201d the one holding him captive says. \u201cAs are you.\u201d</p> <p>Frozen in place by the man\u2019s single foot, Jake stares with hatred into his emotionless dark eyes. There is no way he can possibly know what Jake is. No one does. Not even his beloved wife. Centuries ago Jake was sworn to secrecy. The rest were slain. He\u2019s the only one left. \u201cI am going to kill you,\u201d Jake says, his voice eerily calm.</p><p>With one slender hand, the young man leans down, grasps Jake by the throat, and removes his foot and lifts him straight off the ground. \u201cI know what you are,\u201d he says, his voice even. \u201cBecause \u2019twas I who slaughtered your brethren. You\u2019re immortal.\u201d A slow smile stretches across his face. \u201cAnd now you\u2019ll become one of us.\u201d</p><p>In less time than it takes Jake tae blink, the man transforms. No longer a man. Sharp teeth drop from his gums into long, pointed shards; his lips pull back into an exaggerated grimace. His jaw extends. And his eyes are now merlot red. Jake knows what he is. His brethren hunted them long ago.</p><p>Vampires.</p><p>Tightening his grip around Jake\u2019s neck, Jake gasps for air. His limbs are paralyzed and he canna even strike out to defend himself. And in his next breath this monster has ripped open Jake\u2019s shirt and exposed his chest. He sinks those sharp fangs straight into Jake\u2019s heart. Intense pain rips through his body, and blackness begins to suffocate him. Jake allows it.</p><p>The last things Jake hears are their voices. Their laughter. But he doesna understand what they\u2019re saying. In his recent memory he retrieves the sound of his children, his wife, screaming. They\u2019re dead. He knows he\u2019ll never see them again. A pain much worse than the physical one his body is experiencing takes over. Fills his mouth, his eyes, his soul, with an acrid blackness. And then he remembers no more. . . .</p> <p>\u201cRiley?\u201d</p><p>My blurry vision clears and I stare up into the modern-day face of Jake Andorra. I understand him a little better now. My arms are above my head, pinned by his extraordinary strength. He is smiling, proud that he\u2019s pinned me so efficiently. Rendered me helpless.</p><p>So he thinks.</p><p>I\u2019ll go easy on him. Sort of. I mean, he says he knows what I\u2019m capable of, yet he shows no fear. Mocks me, even, with that silly grin. Dares me with that eye twinkle.</p><p>My stare fixes on Jake, and I concentrate on what I want his body to do. I tell Jake what to do. With my mind. Like before, everything around us goes silent. Turns hazy. Only Jake is in focus. I stare, concentrate, targeting his mind. It\u2019s like being in a dark, winding tunnel. He\u2019s at one end. I\u2019m at the other.</p><p>Balls, seize like you\u2019re being squeezed between a pair of vise grips. Breath, catch in throat. Eyes, widen. Pain, take over until I say stop.</p><p>Jake releases me, grabs his crotch. His breath catches and a little squeak emerges. His eyes widen, and he rolls right off of me. Groaning in pain. Clutching his \u2019nads.</p><p>I bask in the glory for only a second or two.</p> <p>Pain, stop.</p><p>Immediate relief eases the lines of pain on Jake\u2019s face. His body relaxes. A stare of intense curiosity and admiration fills his eyes. \u201cThat,\u201d he says, pushing up and standing to face me, \u201cwas impressive. Dirty, but impressive.\u201d</p><p>Drop to your knees and freeze. This is directed at Noah, who has eased up behind me, ready to grab me. He never makes it. Noah instantaneously drops to his knees behind me. Frozen in place.</p><p>Tell me I\u2019m a goddess.</p><p>\u201cYou are a goddess,\u201d Noah says involuntarily.</p><p>Chuckles fill the room.</p><p>And say, \u201cI\u2019m such a ding-dong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m such a ding-dong,\u201d he says.</p><p>Now it\u2019s all-out laughter filling the dojo. I cover my mouth, trying be serious. Kinda hard when a centuries-old vampire is on his knees, calling himself a ding-dong.</p><p>Get up.</p><p>Noah shakes his head and stands. Only then I notice everyone else staring at me, wide-eyed. Noah drapes his arm around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cPretty sick trick, babe,\u201d he says with a grin. He gently cuffs my jaw with his fist. \u201cGlad you\u2019re on our side.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t help but smile. It is a sick trick. Thanks, Julian Arcos. Word.</p><p>I notice Gabriel has his cell phone to his ear. He speaks in a low voice, then puts the phone in his pocket. \u201cDe Barre and Conwyk are close,\u201d he says to Jake. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for the swords?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Jake answers, and as the others talk in groups, Jake inclines his head toward the far wall. \u201cA word?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I feel Eli\u2019s gaze on mine, and I look at him. He\u2019s standing next to Noah. I smile and walk to meet Jake. I already know what he wants.</p><p>Jake looks uncomfortable. With his arms folded over his chest, he bends his head close to mine. Green eyes\u2014eyes I now know have seen more than their fair share of pain and heartache\u2014study me. Hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d he asks. Jake leans close and he all but crowds me, he\u2019s so big.</p><p>Without hesitation, I meet his gaze. \u201cThe night you were taken,\u201d I answer. \u201cYou were jumped by several vampires. You didn\u2019t know what they were at first because they attacked you from above.\u201d His face flashes with pain as memories race through his head. \u201cThey killed your family,\u201d I say quietly, and rest my hand against his forearm. \u201cThey turned you that night. I\u2019m sorry, Jake. I know what it\u2019s like to lose someone you love. I can\u2019t imagine losing three at once.\u201d</p><p>A waver of vulnerability flares in his fathomless eyes. A glimpse of his past rests there, and I can see it. I can feel his pain all over again, feel the love he still has for his wife and children. So many years ago, yet in those flash of seconds, he relives it as though it has just happened. His eyes soften as they stare at me. Not a day goes by that I don\u2019t think of them. Time has eased the pain, though.</p><p>I narrow my eyes. Liar.</p><p>A smile touches Jake\u2019s mouth. Somewhat.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here,\u201d Gabriel says, interrupting.</p><p>Jake gives Gabriel a nod.</p><p>\u201cWho is here?\u201d I ask, looking between the two.</p><p>Jake meets my questioning gaze. \u201cTwo of the fiercest, most lethal swordsmen,\u201d he says with a grin, \u201cof the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.\u201d He slaps my back, and I buck forward. \u201cYour new mentors.\u201d</p><p>A grumbling voice catches my attention from outside, and I tune my acute hearing to pick it up. The accent is . . . odd. English with a little French, and old. Ancient.</p><p>\u201cAndorra! Where the bloody hell are you, man? Damn me, this manor reeks of something chilling and evil. Don\u2019t you think so, Conwyk? Conwyk, where are you? Damn.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Jake, whose slow smile leaves me wondering if I\u2019m in a lot more trouble than I initially think.</p><p>Oh, you most certainly are.</p><p>I resist the urge to smack Jake on the back of the head, and I anxiously await the booming, strange voice to enter the dojo.</p><p>Part Four</p><p>OTHERBEINGS</p><p>There was something awesome in the thought of the solitary mortal standing by the open window and summoning in from the gloom outside the spirits of the nether world.</p><p>\u2014Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, \u201cSelecting a Ghost\u201d</p><p>It gives me some relief to know the extent\u2014or at least most of the extent\u2014of Riley\u2019s powers will more likely than not keep her safe. I knew I\u2019d made the right choice by inviting her to join the team. She\u2019s invaluable. The Fallen will not be easy foes to manipulate, so hopefully she\u2019ll have the power of suggestion as a complete surprise to the bastards. Otherwise, we\u2019ll all be holdin\u2019 our crotches.</p><p>\u2014Jake Andorra</p><p>The very second I think to myself that the dojo can\u2019t become any more crowded with enormous, ancient, testosterone-filled otherbeings, I\u2019m proven wrong. A man ducks into the dojo.</p><p>Swaggering. As if he owns the place.</p><p>His massive body alone nearly fills up the entrance.</p><p>\u201cAndorra!\u201d the man yells.</p><p>Jake laughs and walks toward him. \u201cDe Barre, you fool, I\u2019m right here.\u201d He walks over and grabs the big man by the shoulders and shakes. \u201cGlad to see you, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, aye, the same here,\u201d De Barre answers, grasping Jake\u2019s shoulders in return.</p><p>What kind of name is that\u2014De Barre? I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find out soon enough.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Conwyk?\u201d Jake asks.</p><p>\u201cNo doubt took a bloody wrong turn,\u201d De Barre answers. He looks around. \u201cThis place. It gives me nightmares just standing here. There\u2019s something unsettling about it.\u201d</p><p>We have one thing in common so far.</p><p>Jake laughs. \u201cThe Crescent has its own particular . . . charm. And that\u2019s funny, coming from you, my old friend.\u201d He turns and eyes me. \u201cCome on, man, and meet your new pupils.\u201d</p><p>I watch the two big men cross the dojo, hugging the wall and making their way toward me. Even I, surrounded by unusually gorgeous otherbeings, have to admit that besides being massive, he\u2019s one handsome guy.</p><p>And apparently old as dirt. Jake had mentioned twelfth and thirteenth centuries. I can see that, looking at this guy. He\u2019s all of six feet, six inches. At least. He is taller than Jake, Gabriel, and Eli. Heavily muscled. Broad shoulders. Dark wavy hair to his shoulders, partially pulled back at the nape. Piercing eyes lock onto mine as he walks. Struts, rather. He definitely has swag. Definitely swagalicious. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Across the dojo, Eli all but growls. I try not to laugh. I shoot him a mock stern look and turn to meet my mentor.</p><p>\u201cTristan de Barre, this is our newest and most human WUP member, Ms. Riley Poe,\u201d Jake introduces, and looks at me. He lifts a dark brow.</p><p>Before I can acknowledge the intro, Tristan de Barre grasps my hand and lowers his head over it. His eyes, a striking shade of sapphire, fix on mine. \u201cMy pleasure, lady,\u201d he says, then brushes his lips over the top of my hand.</p> <p>It happens too fast.</p><p>I really need to learn how to control this gift.</p><p>The room spins, tilts, and I feel myself losing gravity as a suffocating blackness swallows me. I know what\u2019s happening the second it begins.</p><p>I\u2019m him. Tristan. I concentrate hard, and this time, I\u2019m able to watch, as if peering through a window. It\u2019s a long-ago century, that much is for sure. A musky, dank dungeon. It\u2019s cold, and Tristan is shackled to the wall.</p><p>Then, everything happens in fast-forward. A man, trusted by Tristan. Murder. A curse that lasts centuries. Tristan and his knights are spirits . . .</p> <p>\u201cLady? Is there aught amiss?\u201d</p><p>My body is shaken by strong hands. None too gently. I feel it, but I\u2019m still watching . . .</p><p>\u201cLady?\u201d</p><p>I blink and focus on Tristan\u2019s face no more than a few inches from my own. He is holding me in his arms. He blinks.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you unwell?\u201d he asks. Sapphire eyes narrow. \u201cIs Andorra tasking you overmuch?\u201d</p><p>Tristan speaks in the weirdest of ways, yet I seem to get most of what he\u2019s saying. I slip a fast glance at Jake Andorra, who is standing close by, then look back at Tristan. \u201cYes. He is.\u201d</p> <p>A slow, sexy smile spreads over Tristan\u2019s face. \u201cYou remind me of my lovely wife, Ms. Poe. Quite feisty, you Colonists.\u201d He fingered the wings inked into my cheek. \u201cAlthough you\u2019ve a few more unnatural attributes.\u201d He sets me straight on my feet and looks down at me. \u201cShe\u2019s got speckles,\u201d he drags his finger over the bridge of his nose. \u201cJust here. Now, then. What did you see when I touched you?\u201d</p><p>The others are standing close behind me now, all awaiting my answer. \u201cYou\u2019re called Dragonhawk,\u201d I answer, meeting full-on his inquisitive gaze. I tell him everything I\u2019d just witnessed. \u201cYour foster father murdered you and your knights. Not sure which century but I know it was a helluva long time ago.\u201d I cock my head. \u201cSo . . . how are you here now?\u201d I poke his chest. \u201cYou seem solid enough, but you were all ghosts for centuries. Are you immortal, too? I don\u2019t know what year it was, but\u201d\u2014I glance down at his thick thighs clothed in black martial arts gear\u2014\u201cyou looked like you were wearing pantyhose under all those steel chains.\u201d</p><p>Tristan\u2019s compelling blue gaze fixes on mine. He studies me for a moment before throwing his head back and laughing.</p><p>I stare at Jake.</p><p>\u201cDamn me, but you\u2019re a witty wench,\u201d Tristan says. \u201cAye. My men and I were murdered by my foster father. \u2019Twas in the fourteenth century. We walked the earth as spirits after that. Ghosts cursed, for nearly seven hundred years. \u2019Twas not that long ago that my bride swept into my life and saved me.\u201d His blue eyes shine. \u201cSaved us all.\u201d</p><p>Wench?</p><p>\u201cI guess we all have a lot of catching up to do,\u201d I say. \u201cWhere does that accent come from? Besides the fourteenth century?\u201d I smile.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Tristan says, nodding. \u201c\u2019Tis my English-French Norman accent you fancy. As does my bride, Andrea.\u201d</p> <p>I nod my approval.</p><p>\u201cWhen we sup I shall tell you all about it,\u201d Tristan promises. He glances around. \u201cThere are beings in this chamber who still consume food, aye? Mortal food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley definitely does,\u201d Noah says. He walks up and sticks his hand out to Tristan, and the two shake. \u201cNoah Miles. I\u2019ve heard quite a lot about you from Andorra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I, you,\u201d Tristan answers. \u201cI hear you have a fine \u2019sixty-nine Camaro you\u2019ve restored single-handedly.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes take on a shine that I\u2019ve seen in otherbeings and human males alike. It\u2019s that . . . car-shine. A deep, weird love of iron and steel and whatever else with four tires. \u201cI did,\u201d Noah says. \u201cSmooth and fine.\u201d</p><p>See?</p><p>As Jake introduces Tristan around the room, I lean my back against the wall, cross my feet at the ankles, and watch. It\u2019s sort of a surreal scene. I\u2019m in an old manor, once a school for weird, freaky little kids with unexplained powers, and I\u2019m training under a medieval knight who was murdered centuries ago but gained another chance at mortality. I\u2019m part of an extermination team comprised of vampires, immortal druids, and werewolves. We\u2019re in old Edinburgh, where three nasty fallen angels can create human-looking monstrosities to apprehend innocent souls for their own selfish needs.</p><p>And then there\u2019s me. Probably the most . . . normal of the bunch.</p><p>With the exception of Peter. The old, crazy driver.</p><p>Seriously, even growing up with my surrogate Gullah grandparents and their hoodoo and root-doctor beliefs, I never suspected such otherbeings existed on the same plane as mortals. To look at them all now\u2014Tristan, Jake, Darius, Gabriel, Eli, Noah, Victorian, Lucian, Ginger, and Sydney\u2014they seem to be ordinary, although beautiful, regular-Joe human beings. Skin. Flesh. Muscle. Bone. Blood.</p><p>Well, some without blood.</p><p>It\u2019s all seriously mind-blowing.</p><p>Despite the long windows lining the dojo wall, the already-bleak grayness from outside now grows darker, shadows begin to extend, and the chamber takes on a distinctly creepy, eerie feel. It\u2019s almost as if I\u2019m looking at an old black-and-white roll of film or one of the silent pictures from the 1920s. Surreal. That\u2019s about the only word that fits it. I almost feel displaced, as if I\u2019m not really here, but rather looking down through a hole and seeing all of this going on. Weird.</p><p>\u201cGrimm. How nice of you to find your way up here and join us,\u201d Tristan says, causing me to glance at the doorway.</p><p>And things only get weirder.</p><p>Now there\u2019s the guy standing in the entranceway. I immediately sense something different about him, other than being from a long-ago century. Something unearthly. Not so much . . . otherbeing, but, no . . . yeah. Otherbeing. Holy? Definitely ethereal. With dark, wavy auburn hair worn loose around his shoulders, he isn\u2019t as big and bulky as Tristan. Lean. Strong. Broad. He also wears black martial arts gear and a black jacket. His name is Grimm? Seriously?</p><p>\u201cAye, well, I was detained by Peter,\u201d he replies. He moves his gaze to Gabriel. \u201cGabriel, quite a . . . unique place, this.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel gives a slight nod. He even almost smiles. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>I study Grimm. A unique sort of accent he has, too. Old. Medieval, like Tristan\u2019s, but different somehow. I\u2019m already anxious to hear his story.</p><p>Or see it.</p><p>Jake introduces him to the team. \u201cGawan of Conwyk, of Castle Grimm, and a longtime best mate of de Barre here,\u201d he says. \u201cConwyk, the team.\u201d</p><p>Gawan Conwyk, also, apparently, called Grimm, glances over us all, and his eyes rest on me. It\u2019s not difficult to follow his eyes as he takes in my inked wings. He gives a slight nod of acknowledgment.</p><p>Why do I feel as though I\u2019ve been the topic of convo between these guys?</p><p>Because you have, love, says Jake in my head. You are somewhat of an anomaly, Ms. Poe. Get used to it.</p><p>A snort escapes me. I can\u2019t hold it in. Swear to God, I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m the anomaly here? Seriously?</p><p>All eyes turn to me.</p><p>Jake smothers a grin.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he finally says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we break into groups?\u201d He points. \u201cEli, you\u2019re with Conwyk. Miles, you\u2019re with Gabriel. Lucian, you\u2019re with me. Ginger, you and Sydney are with Darius.\u201d Jake\u2019s gaze latches on to mine. \u201cRiley, you\u2019re with de Barre. We\u2019ll eventually all rotate partners, to get the feel of each different technique used in sparring. For now\u201d\u2014he throws a probing look over us all\u2014\u201clet\u2019s see what you have. Miles, MacLeod, help me with this mat. Aye?\u201d</p><p>We all step off the mat and hug the wall, and Jake and the guys roll up the mat and push it to the end of the dojo. Beneath it lays the old wooden floor. I notice every couple of feet are four grooves embedded into the wood. When I glance up, Jake\u2019s grinning at me. \u201cDesks. For the children.\u201d</p><p>God, that freaks me out.</p><p>Jake laughs.</p><p>\u201cMs. Poe?\u201d</p><p>I turn and look up\u2014way up. Tristan is standing there, waiting. \u201cReady?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d I respond.</p><p>Together we cross the dojo. I catch Eli\u2019s gaze, he gives me a smile, and he turns to talk to Gawan. I have to say, I extremely need some Eli Time. Soon.</p><p>Good to hear, Poe. Now pay attention so you don\u2019t get hacked with a blade, oui?</p><p>I smile to myself and notice then that Tristan is staring at me as we walk. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting bit of artwork on your face, Ms. Poe,\u201d he says. \u201cDoes it mean something?\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cYeah,\u201d I say. \u201cIt means I was wasted when I got it,\u201d I answer. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t even remember getting inked. I was . . . young. Stupid.\u201d</p><p>Tristan\u2019s stare is profound and lasts for several seconds. \u201cAye, well, we\u2019ve all been that at one time.\u201d His eyes are sincere. \u201cIt means something now, aye?\u201d</p><p>I consider his words. \u201cYeah, I guess it does.\u201d The big guy seems to be a bit more perceptive than I gave him credit for.</p><p>The sound of steel sliding against metal catches my attention, and I glance over to the rack of blades just as Eli is withdrawing a sword. Damn, it\u2019s big. Only then do I notice Gawan, who has pulled off his jacket. The black, billowy sleeves of his martial arts tunic come only to just below his elbows. Extending down each arm is a series of pitch-black markings all the way to his fingers. I\u2019m too far away to see them in detail, but they intrigue me.</p><p>\u201cTry this one out for size,\u201d Tristan says, and I turn my attention to the sword he\u2019s holding out to me. \u201cGrasp the hilt like so,\u201d he instructs, and I do as he says. \u201cFeel the weight of it in your arms. Make sure it\u2019s distributed from hilt to sword tip.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Extending it just in front of me, I measure the weight. It\u2019s not too heavy; my muscles tighten as they control it. \u201cIt feels okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust okay, or does it feel more like an extension of your arm?\u201d Tristan asks.</p><p>I heft it up and down and then smile. \u201cOkay, yeah, I can feel it from my shoulder to my fingertips.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye, \u2019tis a good sign, then,\u201d he answers. From a large black leather scabbard, he withdraws his own sword. A sapphire stone commands the hilt.</p><p>\u201cNice,\u201d I say, looking it over. I glance up at Tristan. \u201cBig.\u201d</p><p>He hefts it a time or two. \u201cAye, but at my size \u2019twould do me no good to use a splinter, like the one you have. Now, would it?\u201d He grins.</p><p>\u201cSplinter?\u201d I reply. I tap my blade to his. \u201cTalk is cheap, big guy. Teach me, and I\u2019ll show you what I can do with a splinter. Show me what\u2019s what.\u201d</p><p>Tristan nods. \u201cVery well. Put your blade back in the rack.\u201d</p> <p>I blink. \u201cSay what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to see a pair of true sword fighters duel before handling a crash course yourself,\u201d Jake says.</p><p>Conwyk steps forward. Both men disrobe down to just their pants. My eyes nearly bug out of their sockets.</p><p>Across Gawan\u2019s chest, down both arms, and from shoulder to shoulder and down his spine are intricately inked markings. Old-looking.</p><p>Very old indeed. They\u2019re Pictish symbols, Jake offers in my head. Each stand for a number of men killed in battle.</p><p>Well, damn. I don\u2019t even know what else to say about that.</p> <p>Tristan and Gawan draw their swords, move to the center of the dojo. I, along with the team, move to the edges to watch. Beside me, Lucian and Eli. Each swordsman takes his position\u2014back straight, legs apart and braced\u2014and taps the other blade with his own.</p><p>Then the swinging and hacking begins.</p><p>Steel against steel rings out in the dojo, and I almost cover my ears at the sound of it. The muscles in both men\u2019s arms tighten, flex, and rip as they swing, clash, and charge one another. They literally look as if they mean to hack off the other\u2019s head. It\u2019s amazing to watch. Sweat plasters their hair to their heads, rolls off their biceps and down their arms. Each makes a fierce grunt as they swing and lunge and steel collides with steel so fiercely, my insides quiver. In a move so fast I almost don\u2019t follow it, Tristan flicks his blade at Gawan\u2019s shoulder and nicks him. Gawan, almost as fast, flicks Tristan on the chin. Both draw blood.</p><p>In a chamber filled with vampires.</p><p>Eeesh.</p><p>My gaze immediately shoots over to the one vampire I least trust to control himself around spontaneous bloodletting: Victorian Arcos.</p><p>A slow grin lifts his lips. One dark eyebrow rises.</p><p>The clamoring of steel drags my attention back to Tristan and Gawan. I study their steps, their movements, and I can\u2019t help but notice how graceful such large men can be. I know I\u2019m witnessing an ancient art of combat\u2014actually accomplished in ancient times\u2014at work.</p> <p>It\u2019s beyond breathtaking.</p><p>Finally, the two warriors are pressed close, face-to-face, their blades pushed against each other. They\u2019re both breathing hard, but not nearly as raggedly as I would expect after all that combat. Then, with his free hand, Tristan punches Gawan in the head.</p><p>In. The. Head.</p><p>Gawan lets out what can only be a string of weird, unintelligible medieval curses, rears back the hilt of his sword, and cocks Tristan in the jaw.</p><p>Godalmightydamn.</p><p>\u201cHalt!\u201d Jake yells and steps in probably just before the two get ready to throw down on the floor and wrestle, or just plain beat the crap out of each other. \u201cEnough. Top form as always, Dreadmoor. Grimm, you\u2019ve still got it. Simply amazing.\u201d</p><p>Tristan wipes his brow with his forearm. \u201c\u2019Tisn\u2019t as easy as it once was, I fear,\u201d he says. \u201cWhilst I have an interesting past, I\u2019m one hundred percent mortal now.\u201d He flicked a hank of his hair. \u201cI vow I saw a gray hair yesterday morn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I can change that for you,\u201d Jake says, grinning. \u201cIf you wish.\u201d</p><p>Tristan frowns. \u201cKeep your fangs far from me, Andorra. I\u2019ve existed longer than you, my boy, and I look forward to growing old with my bride.\u201d</p><p>I like hearing that come from Tristan.</p><p>Over the next few hours, we remain in our original pairs and practice stance, movement, and thrusts. It\u2019s a lot more involved than leaping, climbing up a newling\u2019s back, and plunging a dirk into its heart. Of course, the sparring probably won\u2019t be all that necessary.</p><p>We only have to take off their heads. That\u2019s it.</p><p>We don\u2019t have much time for practicing. And we still have to learn our way around old Edinburgh so we can actually hunt them.</p><p>\u201cDamn me. Can we sup now?\u201d Tristan bellows over the dojo. \u201cI vow my gullet is empty. Andorra!\u201d</p><p>Jake laughs. \u201cAye. Just for you, Dreadmoor.\u201d</p><p>Tristan gives a satisfactory nod. \u201cAppreciated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour markings are interesting,\u201d a voice says from behind.</p><p>I turn and find Gawan standing there, his perceptive brown eyes taking in my exposed, inked arms. I shrug and smile, then incline my head toward him. \u201cYours are pretty intense, too,\u201d I say. I draw a little closer, my eyes peering at the finely detailed black marks. \u201cJake tells me they represent deaths in battle,\u201d I say. \u201cBut what are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt one time, marks of valor,\u201d Gawan answers. \u201cNow they\u2019re naught but reminders of a time I\u2019d rather scrape from my past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d I say, and stare at a particularly fascinating mark. \u201cNo disrespect, Gawan, but these symbols are beautiful.\u201d I lightly finger one on his shoulder.</p><p>And that\u2019s all it takes.</p><p>That simple grazed touch of my finger pad to his shoulder.</p><p>For the third time since arriving in Scotland, it happens. A wave of nausea washes over me and vertigo sends me spinning, turning head over heel, and shadows fall over me until I\u2019m engulfed in blackness.</p><p>I\u2019m now Gawan. It\u2019s the time of the Crusades. I sacrifice my life for an enemy\u2019s young son. I\u2019m granted an earthbound life as a guardian angel . . . life flashes in frames, faster and faster, up until the present . . . Until Ellie . . .</p><p>\u201cRiley?\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s voice pulls me from the dark mist. His hand is there against my back. His body is close. My vision comes into focus on his face, which is looking quizzically back at me. Gawan is next to him, his profound stare boring into mine.</p><p>\u201cYou were just saying how interesting that particular mark was,\u201d Gawan says. \u201c\u2019Tis strange that you noticed it first. \u2019Twas my first mark.\u201d</p><p>I look at Gawan. I glance at Eli. The rest of the team is hanging out, just talking. Everyone is pretty much in the same spot as when I swirled out of control and into Gawan\u2019s past.</p><p>Had it happened that fast? Mere seconds?</p><p>At least I didn\u2019t hit the floor this time.</p><p>\u201cThe symbols are fascinating artwork,\u201d I say to Gawan.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Twas fine craftsmanship indeed,\u201d he answers. Then, he studies me. \u201cAndorra told Dreadmoor and myself of your abilities. Did you see thusly into my past? Just now?\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cYes.\u201d I cock my head, remembering everything I\u2019d seen. \u201cThe girl. Ellie? Was she dead?\u201d</p><p>A slight smile touches Gawan\u2019s lips. \u201cShe is now my wife, but aye, she was more . . . in betwixt, as we say. Not quite dead. Not quite alive, either.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you all about it soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Now that I know Gawan\u2019s past, or at least a small piece of it, I find him to be more than curious. There\u2019s something else about him that strikes me. He\u2019s more than just an ex-warlord and sword-swinging badass Crusader from the twelfth century. He\u2019s more than a warrior once proud of how many men he\u2019d killed. There\u2019s something about him that wasn\u2019t fully revealed to me in the vision, and is teasing at the edge of my consciousness.</p><p>I just can\u2019t place my finger on it.</p><p>Maybe I should start wearing long gloves? Seems I can\u2019t even graze someone\u2019s skin without jumping into a portion of their lives. At the very least I need to learn control.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s clean up and meet downstairs in half an hour,\u201d Jake says. He starts for the door. \u201cDreadmoor, Grimm,\u201d he calls, \u201cthis way.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Gawan follows Jake and Tristan out of the dojo. Eli kisses the top of my head. \u201cWe should hurry,\u201d he says. \u201cI can hear your stomach rumbling from here.\u201d</p><p>I link my fingers through Eli\u2019s and we move toward the doorway. A spark of excitement rushes through me at the thought of learning my way around the streets of old Edinburgh, the catacombs, the narrow alleys.</p><p>And bringing down the Fallen as soon as damn possible.</p><p>I\u2019d like to go ahead and return to some sort of normal life.</p><p>I glance at Eli. One brow is raised.</p><p>Maybe that won\u2019t happen for some time.</p><p>Part Five</p><p>CITY OF THE DEAD</p><p>\u2018Tis now the very witching time of night,</p><p>when churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out</p><p>Contagion to this world.</p><p>\u2014William Shakespeare, The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark</p><p>Aye, this lass is by far the most intriguing of Andorra\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds pack of misfits. Riley Poe. I vow she\u2019ll give the Fallen a run for their coin. Makes me want to stay and join the team, although I know my bride, Andrea, would no doubt clout my ears for doing so.</p><p>\u2014Tristan de Barre, of Dreadmoor Keep</p><p>\u201cOh, hell. Go ahead. I\u2019ll catch up with you guys downstairs,\u201d I say to Eli, just as we start to leave our room. Noah\u2019s at the doorway, waiting. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Forget your purse?\u201d</p><p>Idiot knows I don\u2019t carry a purse. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with purses; there\u2019s just no room on my person. Not while I\u2019m lugging a sword.</p><p>Our task for tonight: conceal a sword while maneuvering through the fishbone streets of Edinburgh.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your purse?\u201d I throw at Noah. He grins and shrugs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eli kisses my nose. \u201cSee you downstairs, then.\u201d</p><p>I love the way his blue eyes take on a dark shine when he looks at me.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m gonna throw up now,\u201d Noah says, then turns and walks off.</p> <p>Eli joins him. Funny how normal a pair of vampires can be.</p><p>I turn back to our room. Hurrying inside, I cross over to my duffel\u2014I haven\u2019t even unpacked it yet\u2014and find the concealed leather sheath containing a silver dirk. I\u2019m wearing a snug black long-sleeved Under Armour shirt that clings to my body. I assemble the thin leather straps of my holster\u2014thinner than a Victoria\u2019s Secret bra strap\u2014adjust it over my shoulders and around my waist, and slip my sheathed dirk inside. I grab the black, ankle-length oiled canvas coat, which will completely hide the sheath, dirk, and sword, and turn to leave.</p><p>I noticed you the moment you set foot in Edinburgh. And I\u2019m completely and irrevocably intrigued.</p><p>Adrenaline surges through me and I snap my head around. I search the room. There\u2019s no one around. Of course there\u2019s not. The voice just formed in my head.</p><p>So who the hell is it?</p> <p>Aye, in time we shall meet. And I look forward to it, Riley Poe. This changes things, you know. You being here. It changes . . . everything.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d I ask out loud. \u201cDon\u2019t be shy. Give up a name.\u201d</p><p>Ah, if only I could. We\u2019ll meet soon enough. Then you\u2019ll know more than my name. Until . . .</p><p>I know the voice is now gone. I can no longer feel it residing in my mind. I have no idea where it came from, but I know it\u2019s not someone on the team. Is it another vampire lurking in the city? Another otherbeing? One of the Fallen? The voice is almost familiar. Almost, but not quite. All I know is that it leaves within me a quiver in its wake.</p><p>Just as I jog through the doorway, I jerk to a stop. A sensation of dread fills me. I glance behind me, look into the gloom of my room, and see nothing there but long, stretching shadows and furniture. The moment I turn back around, she\u2019s there. She wasn\u2019t seconds before. Standing just on the other side of the threshold is a young girl. Black hair. Black dress. Black stockings. Black shoes. Her skin is pasty white, and large dark eyes stare at me.</p><p>For a moment or two, I\u2019m paralyzed. I can\u2019t even speak. Despite being surrounded by otherbeings on a daily basis, this one feels different.</p> <p>With mouth wide open and distorted, as if releasing a silent, strangled scream, the strange little girl throws herself straight at me. Through me.</p><p>My body jerks, and I gasp. I\u2019m filled with icy cold. Not a cool draft on my skin, but freezing cold inside. Like it sifts through my skin, freezes my blood, and scrapes my bones. I shiver and spin around.</p><p>She\u2019s gone. Only the eerie shadows in my room remain. I blink several times.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Victorian says behind me.</p><p>I turn toward him. I didn\u2019t even notice him approaching me. \u201cI think,\u201d I say, glancing around. \u201cI swear I think I just saw a ghost,\u201d I say. \u201cThat, or this place is just getting to me. This creepy old house totally gives me the freaking willies. Let\u2019s get the hell out of here.\u201d I head out and shut the door behind me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a willie?\u201d he asks.</p><p>With a sideways, mocking glare, I shake my head. \u201cNothing, Vic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to know in case I have them myself,\u201d he pushes.</p> <p>I can\u2019t help but laugh. We hit the steps and I jog down, Vic right beside me. \u201cYou know,\u201d I explain. \u201cA creepy-crawly feeling, like under your skin. Your hair stands up on your neck? Goose bumps?\u201d By the blank look on Victorian\u2019s face, I can tell he\u2019s never experienced the feeling.</p><p>\u201cProbably because I\u2019m usually the cause of the feeling,\u201d Vic says.</p><p>I roll my eyes. He\u2019s probably right.</p><p>At the bottom of the steps, the others gather. Twelve of us in all, dressed in various shades of black and gray we look like a funeral procession. I turn my attention to Jake.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll break into three groups and take separate directions,\u201d Jake says, then explains. \u201cI think a group as large as ours walking together would cause unwanted notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Peter says as he emerges from the sitting room. \u201cYou may wish to see this.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cHorrible.\u201d</p><p>Jake, Gabriel, and Darius lead the way to the sitting room, and we all follow. I look at Eli, who merely shrugs. A large flat-screen television on mute takes up a good portion of one wall.</p><p>\u201cTurn it up, Peter,\u201d Jake asks.</p><p>Peter unmutes the TV, and immediately a blast of sirens echoes through the room. A scene of an apartment building and a reporter standing on the sidewalk in front of the entrance. Lights from the fire and police vehicles flash across his face. \u201cThere appears to be nothing else burned, save the victim,\u201d the reporter says, and points to the building behind him. \u201cThe victim\u2019s name is being withheld until the next of kin is properly notified, but its been reported that, nothing else seems to be charred except the body.\u201d He looks at the camera. \u201cHuman self-combustion? What else could cause such an atrocity?\u201d The reporter turns away. \u201cThis is horrific. I am positive the authorities will have answers soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recognize the building. It\u2019s in the flats close to St. Giles\u2019. Lets go check it out,\u201d Jake says.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I ask. \u201cWhat do you think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI canna say,\u201d Jake answers. \u201cFor now, we overlook nothing. Could just be a junkie who lit himself up huffing the wrong can of aerosol.\u201d</p><p>I get that. Druggies do crazy shit.</p><p>\u201cThe layout of old Edinburgh is verra simple,\u201d Gabriel says, turning to face us. Eyes scan the team. \u201cThink of the Royal Mile as a fishbone. At the head of the spine, the castle. At the tail, the Palace of Holyroodhouse and Scottish Parliament\u201d\u2014he inclines his head\u2014\u201cjust down the way. And all the tiny fish ribs are the tightly knit closes and wynds in between. As you might\u2019ve noticed as you approached the Crescent, we are along one such wynd. We\u2019ll get to the flats if we go onto Canongate and turn right. I will lead a group. Jake and Darius will head up the other two groups. We can all come together and check out the accident. Any questions?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t have any, but I think that\u2019s the most I\u2019ve heard Gabriel speak. Ever.</p><p>\u201cRight. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Jake says, heading toward the entryway. Only then do I see the swords and scabbards leaning against the wall. Three are notably smaller than the others. Chic blades. \u201cEach of you grab a blade, strap on the scabbard, and practice concealing as you move through the city.\u201d Jakes says with a sly grin. \u201cIt won\u2019t be as easy at you think. And, yes\u201d\u2014he looks at me\u2014\u201cthe slighter ones are for the ladies.\u201d</p><p>Within minutes, we\u2019re all geared up. We split into groups, and I\u2019m with Jake, Tristan, and Eli. The moment I step over the threshold, I feel it. The only way I can describe the sensation is like a hot, wet death shroud pulled over my face and suffocating me. I feel it everywhere. My eyes dart to the corners of the shadows, the areas illuminated by the recessed lights of the building, any nook and cranny something could be lurking in, and I see nothing. I don\u2019t care if the Black Fallen are possibly, hopefully still recovering. Their presence lingers in the air like a heavy fog. I don\u2019t like it. Not one damn bit.</p><p>Eli\u2019s hand slips inside my coat and around my waist. I glance up at him, and in his eyes I find complete understanding. I lean into him, feel his hard chest close to my cheek, and it comforts me. I know\u2014sounds pretty girly. Love does that to a person, I guess.</p><p>Eli squeezes me and kisses the top of my head. You look endearing with that sword strapped to your side. Turns me on.</p><p>I elbow him in the ribs. What doesn\u2019t turn you on?</p><p>Eli\u2019s smile is predatory. I like that.</p><p>Outside the Crescent, darkness has fallen. The air is crisp, and the sound of the fountain echoes against the aged stone walls around us. A tall lamp near the edge of the Crescent casts a light over the courtyard, causing the shadows to creep and stretch over the angel in the fountain. Damn, that is one creepy-ass statue. The weathered stone, with its decayed chips and discoloration, leaves me unsettled inside. I\u2019m not sure what the death-shroud feeling was, but I know I\u2019ll find out sooner rather than later.</p><p>Sounds of traffic aren\u2019t far away. I strain to hear the noise of the city, the drone of thousands of people talking at once. I tune in deeper and distinguish conversation on the street, just outside the Crescent. People walking by. Young people heading to Niddry\u2019s Pub. I\u2019m going to have to work on deciphering the Scottish accent, because it\u2019s pretty heavy. Hard to make out.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Jake says, and we all begin walking toward the gates of the Crescent. Darius takes his group first and heads up Canongate. A minute passes, then Gabriel leaves with his group. They also turn right on Canongate but cross to the opposite side of the street. They all eventually fade into the crowd, which is a little thinner here. Farther up the Royal Mile, there\u2019s heavy foot traffic. Lots of activity.</p><p>\u201cIf we separate, just remember that Royal Mile, High Street, and Canongate are all in one line,\u201d Jake says. \u201cAnd the Crescent is closest to the tail of the fishbone. If anything should happen\u2014anything otherworldly\u2014your best bet is to head straight to St. Giles\u2019. Unless you want to cause a scene on High Street. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>I give a nod and adjust the weight of the sword strapped to my hip. \u201cHow in Hell are we ever supposed to run with this thing?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Tristan, his face cast in half shadows, smiles. \u201cWalk first, lady. Get used to steel on your person. In time, it will feel as if it is part of your body.\u201d</p><p>I look at him. \u201cWomen don\u2019t think about their body the way men do, Dreadmoor,\u201d I answer. I shift the blade again, and Tristan\u2019s lips twitch. \u201cBut I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>Peter emerges from the side of the Crescent, and with a spry walk, approaches. Still wearing that plaid golfer\u2019s hat. \u201cShall I close and lock the gates behind you?\u201d he asks Jake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAye, Peter,\u201d Jake says. \u201cAnd keep your mobile with you at all times,\u201d he tells the older man. \u201cJust in case.\u201d</p><p>In case of what?</p><p>\u201cWill do, Master Jake,\u201d old Peter says.</p> <p>Now we\u2019re on Canongate, walking two by two on the sidewalk. Eli and I follow Jake and Tristan at a leisurely pace. Just out of Tolbooth Wynd is Tolbooth Tavern. I may hit that on the way back. We pass several storefronts\u2014Carson Clark Gallery, an antique map store with several cool prints framed and displayed. A whiskey shop, a few caf\u00e9s, a kilt maker, a woolen shop. Part of me seriously wishes I were nothing more than a tourist, browsing stores and cramming delicious food in my mouth. Buying postcards.</p><p>Not gonna happen. Not on this trip.</p><p>The farther up we ascend the Royal Mile, the denser the sidewalk becomes with people. I get a few curious looks at the ink on my cheek, but for the most part nothing obnoxious. The steel strapped to my side bounces with each step, and I shove a hand in my coat pocket to brace the sword against my thigh. It\u2019s already becoming easier to move with it. Amazing.</p><p>I notice everyone around me. I hear them whispering, making idle chatter inside pubs, utensils clacking against plates as they eat. Laughter. Normal stuff. We move through the night, and the streetlights fall over us. Shadows lengthen as we walk.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Eli says, and points.</p> <p>Way up on the craggy hill, as if it carved out of the rock itself, is Edinburgh Castle. It\u2019s lit up, and glows like a beacon over the aged city. \u201cPretty cool,\u201d I answer, and truly it is. Different from Julian Arcos\u2019s castle in the Carpathians, yet the architecture is just as breathtaking.</p><p>Ahead, several police cars and an ambulance are parked outside of a row of flats. A news truck sits outside.</p><p>\u201cThe combustion,\u201d I say to Eli. \u201cI can smell the charred flesh from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs can I,\u201d Eli answers. \u201cSure you want to go?\u201d</p><p>I look at my fianc\u00e9 and smile. \u201cNo, not really. But since I\u2019ve hacked off several newlings\u2019 heads, I am forcing myself not to be squeamish. I need to see it. Helps me understand what we\u2019re up against.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit, girl,\u201d Tristan says over his shoulder. \u201cA true warrior.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll clear a path,\u201d Jake says.</p><p>And by that I know he means he\u2019ll use his power of suggestion to make all the police and reporters look the other way as we go inside.</p><p>Sure enough, the reporter we saw on TV glances once at us, then turns and heads to his truck. The police all do the same. Jake, Tristan, Eli, and I walk straight through the apartment building and to the victim.</p><p>The scene is far from pretty. The apartment door is ajar, and the pungent scent of burnt human flesh permeates the hallway. You don\u2019t have to have special powers to smell that. Not this close. Jake enters first, followed by Tristan, then Eli, then me.</p><p>\u201cBy Christ\u2019s blood,\u201d Tristan mutters. My eyes follow his to a pile of ash and bone, with two curiously unburned legs, heaped in the seat of a lazyboy chair. The TV is on. Smoke smolders from the pile of ash that used to be a human being.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t the legs scorched as well?\u201d I ask, studying the horrible scene. On a side table, a photograph of a group of young kids. Probably grandchildren. And from the looks of the remaining legs, it was an older woman. Wearing little black grandma loafers.</p><p>So incredibly sad.</p><p>\u201cI canna tell what or who is responsible for this,\u201d Jake admits. \u201cIf it\u2019s the Fallen, they\u2019ve discovered a way around their rejuvenation.\u201d</p> <p>I take one last look at what used to be someone\u2019s grandma. \u201cWell, that just pisses me the hell off,\u201d I say. I feel dark hatred for the Fallen. Instinct kicks in, somewhere deep inside of me, somewhere within my strigoi powers, and I graze my fingertips across the charred victim\u2019s leg. The skin is cold, lifeless, yet immediately my mind hums with the old woman\u2019s last moments of life. Flashes of her little apartment blink behind my eyelids. She\u2019s sitting in her chair, her feet propped up, watching the television and eating some cookies with her tea. Her face is aged and lined, but kind. A long shadow stretches across the room and across her lap, and when she notices it, she glances around the room. The moment her eyes light on the intruder, shrouded in a black cloak, her heart quickens. The intruder moves closer, and the old woman drops her tea cup to the floor where it spills out. Her eyes are stretched wide in horror. The intruder\u2019s face is hidden in the shadows of his hood, and I can\u2019t see his face. But as the woman begins to cry, then choke and cough, the shadowy intruder lifts a single hand to her mouth and touches her lips with a long index finger. The old woman tries to cry out, but she\u2019s silent. Her heart is erratic now, and pain is etched into her grandmotherly features. Then, she begins to smolder. Smoke streams from her middle. Her gaze lowers to her stomach, pain laces her eyes, and then her heart stops altogether. Smoldering smoke turns to flames. But not before the intruder sinks his hand into her chest and retrieves her heart. I shake my head, and my mind returns to the present. I glance at my companions. I\u2019d seen enough. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>As soon as I step from the apartment, my attention is caught. Again.</p><p>I hear a man shouting. Angry shouting. I sense a heavy testosterone level in the air. Violence. My eyes scan the street and sidewalk in front of me.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Eli says, inclining left.</p><p>Up ahead, the aged spires of St. Giles\u2019 Cathedral jut into the night\u2019s sky. A young guy is shouting and cursing just outside of the cathedral. He holds his head, turns around, kicks over a metal trash bin. Kicks over the table and chairs to an outdoor caf\u00e9. Two young women, walking toward him, cross the street and hurry toward us. Avoiding the out-of-control guy. They\u2019re frightened. So are several other passersby.</p><p>Something draws me to him, and I duck behind Eli and cross the street. Three curses sound behind me, and I throw a hasty glance over my shoulder at Tristan, Jake, and Eli. I got this. Something\u2019s not right with this kid. Keep walking. This I say to Eli and Jake. I turn away before I see if they actually listen to me, and head straight for the guy.</p><p>\u201cWhat the feck are ya lookin\u2019 at?\u201d the young guy yells to a small walking tour passing by. They all hurry across the street from him, and he laughs.</p><p>I pass through the tour and make my way directly to him. He\u2019s grabbing the sides of his head again, pleading, cursing, and he drops to the ground in a squat. Just as fast, he\u2019s up again, pacing. He\u2019s maybe twenty years old, if not younger. Hard to tell. Short-clipped brown hair, about five feet, ten inches. Solidly built.</p><p>He won\u2019t go down without a fight.</p><p>When the guy catches sight of me, his eyes widen. \u201cHelp me,\u201d he says. It\u2019s barely more than a whisper.</p><p>In less than a split second, his blue eyes darken to nearly black. A slow grin stretches and distorts his attractive features into something gruesome. A face not his own. It\u2019s freaky as hell, and I wonder if anyone else can see it but me.</p><p>\u201cYou think you can save him?\u201d A cracked voice, not his own, emerges.</p><p>\u201cI know I can,\u201d I answer, and lunge, grabbing both of his hands. My skin contact against his sends tingles up my arm. My head starts to throb. In front of my eyes, a swarm beats wings of inky blackness. But I can\u2019t tell what the swarm is. I see long, spindly wings, bones, and ripped flesh. Not birds. Not bats. I blink several times and concentrate. Hard. Through fuzzy vision, I stare into the guy\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Then, everything spins, and warps. I\u2019m alone, and . . . freezing rain pelts my eyes and cheeks as I run hard, fast, the muscles in my thighs burning almost as much as my lungs. I grip the leather hilt of my sword tightly, throw a quick glance behind me, see nothing, but I don\u2019t slow up. I can hear them everywhere, all around me, a thousand whispers going off at once, and it makes my adrenaline kick into high gear. I run harder. St. Giles\u2019 is the only place I know to go. But is St. Giles\u2019 still St. Giles\u2019 here? Hell if I know, but I get the feeling its not. It\u2019s just a few blocks farther and is the closest sanctuary without taking shortcuts. Shortcuts equal shadows. Here, in this place, in the shadows? Somehow I know they reign, and they\u2019re way too powerful and too many of them for me to take on with one blade. I\u2019m too new at this. I\u2019m used to fighting newlings and seasoned bloodsuckers. Not . . . whatever these things are. How did I get here? I glance around, and although I see Edinburgh, I see where I\u2019d just been walking with Eli, Jake, and Tristan, it\u2019s . . . different. Am I on an alternative plane? Is hallowed ground still hallowed here? I suppose I\u2019ll find out real soon.</p><p>Brown, icy slush piles stagnate against curbs, on sidewalks, in potholes and cobbles, and I pound through a big puddle of it as I make my way up the street, toward the ancient minster. Slush? When did it snow? And where in Hell is that kid? Lamppost to lamppost I run, my boots growing heavier with each step as I stay beneath the lights. I somehow know it\u2019s always deserted here, and on the cusp of darkness; like negatives from a film camera, it has a sepia tone and there are always shadows. I\u2019m on Fallen terra firma. I arrived the second I touched that crazed kid on the street. I know very little about the Fallen, but I suspect they\u2019re in control of my surroundings. Are these winged things demons? Jod\u00eds? Has to be something concocted by the Fallen because I doubt it\u2019s the angels themselves. Jake said they don\u2019t like to get their hands dirty, right?</p><p>That guy is in here. Has to be. An innocent soul who relies on me. That\u2019s all that matters. And he\u2019s here somewhere. I\u2019m gonna find him. . . .</p><p>St. Giles\u2019 comes into view, which is weird, since I had been standing directly beside it earlier. I run toward it as fast and hard as my legs can carry me. The moment my feet hit the church grounds, the whispers grow in numbers, so much that it begins to sound like a hive of angry bees that someone has just beaten with a stick. They\u2019re coming after me. Fuckers. I fly up the walkway, past a stone Celtic cross with a tattered and faded purple cloth draped over it, skid up to the heavy double doors, and grab the knob. Not locked, but the door is jammed. Whispers turn to voices, mocking, almost as though they\u2019re toying with me. \u201cGoddamn it!\u201d I curse, grunting, as I repeatedly slam my shoulder against the door. \u201cCome on!\u201d I yell, grunting. When that doesn\u2019t work, I kick it\u2014hard, over and over, the flat of my boot striking sharp against the wood. Finally, it gives, and I stumble inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The moment my body crosses the holy threshold, the whispers cease. I don\u2019t trust it, though, and I move to the first thing I see that can block the door: a broken, decayed stone statue of an angel.</p><p>Kind of unexpected.</p><p>I knock it over, the rest of what is a wing crumbles, and I drag it to the doorway. I prop it against the wood. I haul ass up the aisle.</p> <p>I can\u2019t say that I feel safe in here; the church is empty and, for some reason, derelict. I know it\u2019s old, and although I\u2019ve never been inside I have a feeling there\u2019s more to it than rotted pews and broken statues. Gabriel and Jake had said to come here. Now, I\u2019m not so sure I made the right choice. I glance around. What few pews remain are turned over; tattered hymnals lay scattered on the floor. The intricate stone rafters above are broken and crumbling, as are the large pillars lining the aisle. The altar is little more than a pile of stone rubble. What once were beautiful stained-glass windows are now shattered.</p><p>There, near the back wall, I see him. The angry kid. Guy. He\u2019s no kid. Just a few years younger than me. He\u2019s huddled on the floor, staring at me, breathing hard, heart slamming in his chest. All this I hear pounding in my own ears. I hurry over and drop to my knees, and I keep my eyes trained on him. Only then does his breathing ease, his heart slow. \u201cMy name is Riley,\u201d I say, and he stares back at me.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s inside me,\u201d he mumbles. Terror makes his eyes look crazed.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I can I\u2019m gonna kick the holy shit out of that thing inside of you.\u201d At first he simply watches me, looking innocent. Then those blue eyes turn black again, and he smiles a creepy smile. \u201cYeah, I know you\u2019re still in there,\u201d I say, and grab his wrist. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The guy opens his mouth and it stretches, exaggerated, into a crooked yawn just before a high-pitched, screeching scream rips from his throat. I\u2019m new at this\u2014didn\u2019t know until now that I could even detect a demon, or a Jod\u00eds, or whatever the hell it is, much less beat one\u2019s ass\u2014so I\u2019m winging it. Hope to God it works.</p> <p>I drag the guy, and he\u2019s literally digging in with his heels. I\u2019m stronger, though, and somehow I know that there\u2019s a big puddle, close to the rubble pile of an altar. A puddle of water. Rainwater? I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s inside the cathedral, and I don\u2019t see any holes in the roof above. I use my strength to grab the kid by the neck and force his face over the puddle. I push, an inch away from his nose submerging.</p><p>He screams again, loud, long, so intense and filled with pain that I fight not to drop the grip I have on him and cover my ears. Then a big splash. The guy goes limp, and I ease him back. I look at the puddle. Trapped inside the murky blackness, it\u2019s there. Screaming. Hairless. Bony. Instead of hands, it has weird, long claws at the tips of a pair of raggedy gray wings. It\u2019s clawing at the puddle from beneath it. Screaming at me in a language I don\u2019t understand. Not sure I want to. So that\u2019s a Jod\u00eds.</p><p>I take in a deep breath and meet the raging stare of the creature in the water. \u201cPain, take over.\u201d</p><p>The creature\u2019s expression changes and twists into a deformity that I barely recognize. For some weird reason I don\u2019t have it in me to even make a conjured-up creature to suffer. Best to end it now. \u201cDie.\u201d</p><p>For a brief, split second, the creature\u2019s eyes change. I see relief in their black depths.</p><p>Then a loud pop. The creature turns to black. The water turns black. Then it slowly dissipates.</p> <p>Gone. Nothing remains except the stone floor.</p><p>The air inside the rectory smells like death, decay, and must, and is as cold as it is outside. With each exhalation my breath billows out in front of me in white puffs. Beside me on the floor is an overturned candleholder; I pick it up, turn it over, and stare at the distorted reflection of my face. A bruised jaw, busted lip, dirt smudges across my forehead. I almost laugh. How the hell did I get those? I don\u2019t remember fighting with anyone. Or anything. I look like I\u2019ve had the shit beat out of me. Maybe I have.</p><p>I glance at the candleholder once more, then toss it aside.</p><p>Just then, the whispers begin again, loudly, all around the cathedral, and this time I can distinguish what they\u2019re saying. Riley. My heartbeat quickens. Well, as much as it will quicken. It\u2019s dead slow as it is, thanks to all the jumbled vampire DNA in my body.</p><p>I turn, grab the guy by the hand, and pull him up. He\u2019s confused, blinking, rubbing his eyes and looking around as if he has no clue what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t. I barely do.</p><p>We head for the front door.</p><p>Above us, the whispers grow to such strength that they\u2019re nothing more than a long, hissing hushhh. The wind stirred by a hundred winged creatures swooshes around us, and we\u2019re all-out running now. My sword is heavy. I shove the broken angel statue out of the way and the guy and I stumble out of the chapel.</p><p>I blink. We\u2019re back. In real-time Edinburgh. When I scan the street, the tour group I\u2019d pushed through is just stepping up onto the sidewalk. They turn and look at me. They look at the guy with me. I turn and face him.</p> <p>Large blue eyes stare back at me. I wait for them to turn black. They don\u2019t. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask.</p><p>He looks around, stares at his surroundings, and I can tell he\u2019s unsure. Of everything. He looks back at me. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d</p><p>I cock my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Where were you last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d</p><p>We both turn to see a group of four young guys making their way toward us, coming from just down the Mile. They\u2019re all talking ninety miles an hour, and in a heavy brogue I can barely understand.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d you disappear to?\u201d one asks. He gives me a long look. \u201cDidna notice this one in the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat club?\u201d I ask. I want to know where they last were before the kid was taken over.</p><p>\u201cOch, an American,\u201d another says. He\u2019s tall, pretty cute, with dark short hair. Maybe nineteen. \u201cHow long are those legs, lass?\u201d he asks.</p><p>Ian slaps his friend on the back of his head. \u201cShut up, you horse\u2019s arse.\u201d</p><p>I give him a smile. All the guys start whistling.</p><p>\u201cZone Seventy,\u201d the other boy offers. \u201cWere you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, damn, I\u2019d have remembered her,\u201d the other boy offers, nodding toward my cheek. \u201cWicked ink.\u201d</p><p>I look at him. \u201cThanks. Maybe I was there. Been to several. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust up the way. Niddry Street,\u201d he answers. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s go,\u201d he says to the others.</p><p>Ian smiles at me. \u201cWanna come?\u201d</p><p>Flattered, I smile. \u201cMaybe next time.\u201d</p><p>Ian and I share a look just before he and the others take off. I can\u2019t tell if he remembers anything at all about what and how a Jod\u00eds had taken over him, but I can definitely tell something happened between us. I\u2019ll talk to Jake and the others first. Maybe they can tell me something about what just happened.</p><p>I watch the guys turn and head down the Mile and turn off onto a side street. Only then do I glance back at St. Giles\u2019.</p><p>It\u2019s enormous. Beautiful. I\u2019m tempted to peek inside, just to see if it would be all crumbly like I\u2019d seen it . . . before. Whatever that was.</p><p>\u201cRiley?\u201d</p><p>When I turn, Eli, Tristan, and Jake are standing behind me. I look at Jake first. \u201cWhat the Hell, Andorra? Something was inside that kid.\u201d</p><p>Jake rubs his chin. \u201cAye, I know.\u201d The light from the streetlamp is shining behind him, causing his entire face to be in shadows. \u201cAngels. Fallen angels. Jod\u00eds. Demons. Evil spirits. Witches.\u201d He cocks his head at me. \u201cYou do know where you\u2019re at, dunna ya? Edinburgh\u2019s black past is full of them all, and they come hand in hand. Each have naturally been integrated in Edinburgh\u2019s dark past.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cWe just typically keep them under control.\u201d</p><p>I glance toward the direction the boys went. \u201cWell, they\u2019re not all under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems,\u201d Jake confesses. \u201cMany things have changed since the Fallen\u2019s arrival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, and mayhap we\u2019re not as prepared as we need to be,\u201d Tristan adds.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Eli asks, brushing a thumb over my cheekbone.\u201d His expression is at first frightened, then grows dark. \u201cAnd who did this to you, Ri?\u201d</p><p>I touch my cheek. It\u2019s bruised. I can feel it. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t even remember getting hit.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s angry. Pissed. He looks up and down High Street. \u201cI look over, you grab that kid and pull him into the cathedral. Less than a minute later you come back out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you look as if someone knocked the holy Hell out of you,\u201d Jake adds.</p><p>\u201cDid that lad strike you?\u201d Tristan asks. He turns without hearing my answer and heads after Ian and his friends.</p><p>\u201cNo, wait!\u201d I stop him. \u201cTristan, it wasn\u2019t the kid.\u201d</p><p>Tristan turns and waits.</p><p>I look up at Eli. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Whatever clocked me, I didn\u2019t feel it. And I\u2019ve had much worse, and you know it.\u201d I look at Jake. \u201cI don\u2019t think that thing was all demon,\u201d I say, then explain its appearance in the puddle. \u201cIt looked a helluva lot like a Jod\u00eds. Not all features, but some. And the second I grabbed Ian\u2019s hands\u2014\u201d I pause as a group of three passes by. \u201cAs soon as I grab his hands, everything changes. We\u2019re on . . . some alternative plane. Edinburgh, but not. St. Giles\u2019, but derelict. Run-down.\u201d I glance at Tristan and Eli, then back to Jake. \u201cAbandoned. Inside the church, everything was a wreck, destroyed. And there were wings beating everywhere, and whispers.\u201d I take a breath. \u201cThey said my name.\u201d</p><p>Jake stares at me, his features stern. That does not make me feel very good. \u201cDid it see you? The creature?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I say. \u201cJust before I forced it out of Ian and killed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Riley,\u201d Eli says.</p><p>Jake blinks. \u201cHow?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I think about it. \u201cI . . . don\u2019t know. I knew it was inside of Ian. His eyes turned pitch-black, and his voice\u201d\u2014I breathe deeply\u2014\u201cwas not his. When I forced him to look at his reflection in the water, it . . . fell out. It was trapped in the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly water,\u201d Tristan offers. \u201cHad to be nothing else but.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d Jake says.</p> <p>By now the crowds had grown thinner, but people were still walking around us. I lower my voice. \u201cIt sort of exploded. Turned the water black, like oil.\u201d I look at Eli. \u201cThen the whispers started, I grabbed Ian, and we hauled ass out. That\u2019s when you saw us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo minutes, Ri,\u201d Eli says. \u201cThat\u2019s how long you were gone.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cWell, in there? In alternative-world Edinburgh? I was gone at least thirty minutes, if not more.\u201d</p><p>Another walking tour\u2014this one small, only six people\u2014moves toward us. The woman leading the tour is wearing a big black cape lined in deep purple. She has a mass of blond hair piled high on her head. She pauses as she passes me, and our eyes meet briefly. Not sure why, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my inked wings. I bank her features to memory. I\u2019m in unfamiliar territory here. I trust no one. Or anything, now.</p><p>We\u2019re walking now, up toward the castle. We stop at a slight, supernarrow alley as another small walking tour emerges. \u201cI\u2019m Rob the Foul Clenger, and this is the real Mary King\u2019s Close,\u201d the man leading the tour announces in a thick brogue. \u201cMy job was to clean up the plague victims. Some say to this day those very souls wander Mary King\u2019s Close, searching for various appendages that may have rotted off whilst sick.\u201d</p> <p>Two young girls say \u201cEww\u201d simultaneously.</p><p>The group moves on, and I glance down the close. Tightly quartered, it\u2019s dark, dank, and reeks of death. Even bygone death. I can smell it. The lamps cast a faint orange hue against the stone.</p><p>\u201cAll the inhabitants died of the plague. Typhus. Cholera.\u201d Jake says and shakes his head. \u201cNasty times.\u201d He looks at Tristan. \u201cWould\u2019na want to go back there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor I,\u201d Tristan agrees.</p><p>We continue walking toward the castle. We pass many small passages, closes, wynds\u2014whatever. No way am I ever going to be able to remember them all. There are too many.</p><p>\u201cI ran inside St. Giles\u2019 and it wasn\u2019t St. Giles\u2019,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you touched a soul taken over by . . . whatever it was. It manipulated you, forced you into its world. Had you entered the church first, it would have been different. And I suspect the Fallen are behind it all,\u201d Jake adds.</p><p>\u201cSwell,\u201d I answer, and continue to note landmarks on my way, various shops and businesses\u2014mostly tourist stuff\u2014along the Mile. Finally, we make our way to the end, and I glance up at Edinburgh\u2019s mighty castle, all lit up and majestic.</p><p>Yet a heavy blanket of evil veils the area. Everywhere I look, I smell, I sense darkness, lurking in every shadow, close, wynd, and the many ye old shoppes lining the way. If it\u2019s this ominous now and the Fallen are on downtime, I can only imagine what it\u2019s like when they\u2019re full force.</p><p>I have a feeling I\u2019ll find out soon enough.</p><p>We walk the streets a bit longer, and a different sort of people emerge. The tourists, for the most part, pack it in for the night. The tartan shops, caf\u00e9s, woolen mills, and bakeries close. Nightclubs open. Bars and pubs boom with activity. And along the Royal Mile, the city\u2019s youth appear. Mostly in groups and having a rousing good time. Some with ink and piercings. Some Goth. Some all in a class of their own. Some just as ordinary as any suburbanite. Let them carouse. Because Hell is about to break loose.</p><p>As we head back to the Crescent, another choking sense of dread overcomes me. I wonder what will happen once the Fallen emerge again with their hideous Jod\u00eds, and they realize help has arrived to eradicate them. I think it will be on. Us against them. And shit\u2019s gonna hit the fan.</p><p>I don\u2019t wanna be in front of the fan.</p><p>Back on Canongate, Tristan and I duck into Bene\u2019s and order, well, just about everything. While we wait, I look at Tristan. \u201cSo. You used to be a fierce thirteenth-century knight. And a ghost.\u201d</p> <p>He grins. \u201cStill am. A fierce knight, that is. A ghost no longer.\u201d</p><p>I cock my head. \u201cSo how did it all happen? How did you . . . become human again?\u201d</p><p>Tristan nods. \u201cAye, well you see, it all began when\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, let me see for myself,\u201d I say, and simply touch Tristan\u2019s arm.</p><p>I see his white smile before the air around me turns pitch-black, and then suddenly I\u2019m in an ancient castle. At least I\u2019m not nauseated anymore.</p><p>I\u2019m now Tristan . . .</p><p>Tristan tried to rid his mind of everything, save the idiot before him. Quite a difficult task, knowing his woman, whom he\u2019d never been able to so much as kiss, stood no more than twenty paces away. That would soon change.</p><p>He breathed at a steady, even rate, his stare fixed as he slowly walked a predatory circle around Erik. Damnation, he could barely believe it. \u201cWhat does it feel like to come back after all these centuries? After lying beneath that oak with twisted yew about your neck? To be a traitor? To take the lives of those you welcomed in to your hall? Gaining the trust of their fathers. Treating us like sons? Being our leader. Tell me, Erik.\u201d He all but growled. \u201cI want to know.\u201d</p><p>Erik, smooth and agile as ever, countercircled. \u201cFeels bloody wonderful, to be truthful. I gave you everything, de Barre. My knowledge, my training skills\u2014everything.\u201d The cynical smile curving his lips made his face appear sinister. He thrust with a vicious strike. \u201cWhat did you do for me in return?\u201d He charged this time, and Tristan deflected the blade with his own. \u201cYou took my only child,\u201d Erik said calmly. He paused, his face blank. \u201cYou took my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you truly believe, Erik? That we killed your son?\u201d Tristan said, blade outstretched. \u201c\u2019Twas an accident, and you well know it.\u201d</p><p>The pain on Erik\u2019s face proved he did not. \u201cFifteen trained knights, and you couldn\u2019t protect one small boy? Nay,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201c\u2019Twas no accident. You allowed it.\u201d He arced his blade. \u201cEven seven centuries of being a damned soul isn\u2019t enough of a repayment for what you took from me.\u201d A smile touched his mouth. \u201cMayhap your life. Again.\u201d</p><p>The sickness his foster father suffered pained Tristan, but at the same time, he knew there would be no saving Erik. His mind had turned evil from hatred. But Tristan wanted to know everything, questions answered. He owed it to his men. He continued to circle. \u201cWhy Andrea?\u201d</p><p>Erik laughed. \u201cRight place, right time. For me anyway.\u201d He jabbed at Tristan. Her unfortunate employer happened to be the one to free me from that cursed yew, which allowed me to escape my tormented prison. One, I might add, my own sweet mother placed me in.\u201d</p><p>Tristan continued to circle, Erik following his lead. \u201cHow did you get their swords and helms?\u201d</p><p>Erik\u2019s face hardened as he followed Tristan\u2019s lead. \u201cI gathered them after your men died in the dungeon. I\u2019d already cursed them, you see, but their deaths came more slowly than yours.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019d bound the armor and planned to bury them so no one would find them, but I hadn\u2019t realized my own mother\u2019s fealty rested elsewhere until . . . later.\u201d He thrust the blade at Tristan, who sidestepped. \u201cShe followed me out to the hole I\u2019d dug and all but took my bloody head off. Next thing I knew, I was here.\u201d</p><p>Tristan tapped his blade to Erik\u2019s. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know she\u2019d placed a protective curse on the weapons herself, or that she\u2019d taken my sword, penned a rather useful verse on it, and buried it?\u201d He charged Erik. \u201cOr that your mother\u2019s spirit would contact Andi and lead her to it?\u201d</p><p>Erik returned the charge. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter now. Does it?\u201d He held up the blade in his hand, turning it side to side. Tristan\u2019s blade. \u201cIsn\u2019t it odd, Dreadmoor, that you\u2019re about to die a second death at the tip of your very own sword?\u201d A smile slid to his mouth. \u201cThanks to Dr. Monroe, I have my life back. And more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, you don\u2019t.\u201d Tristan moved toward Erik, the arc of his blade swiping the air.</p><p>Erik attacked full force, anger turning his face bloodred. With vehemence, he charged.</p><p>He waited for Erik to advance, coming within a few inches of Tristan\u2019s neck. In a move the Dragonhawk had made famous, he deflected the steel and used his elbow to hammer a stunning blow to Erik\u2019s jaw.</p><p>Erik stumbled back, shook his head as if to gather his wits, then charged Tristan with a bloodcurdling yell. \u201cI will not yield!\u201d</p><p>Tristan remembered the same words in the dungeon more than seven centuries before. Except this time, they were reversed.</p><p>Ducking and missing the sword\u2019s blow, Tristan fell to his knees and plunged the blade into Erik\u2019s stomach. \u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes locked, and Tristan watched the pupils in Erik\u2019s eyes grow large until he staggered back and fell to the ground.</p><p>Dead.</p><p>Tristan\u2019s breath came hard and fast, winded from the battle. Slowly, he rose and walked over to retrieve his sword. As he bent over, Erik\u2019s body began to shake violently.</p><p>\u201cTristan, move back!\u201d Kail shouted.</p><p>They all watched in horror as Erik, being the abomination that he was, convulsed faster and faster, his flesh peeling from his bones, his bones turning to dust. Back to where he belonged.</p><p>The bailey fell silent. Tristan raised his head and stared at his men. His knights.</p><p>\u201cSomeone remove that pile of dust from my keep.\u201d</p><p>All fourteen knights let out a battle cry worthy of a thousand men. No doubt the village heard.</p><p>Then his eyes fell on Andrea. Taking powerful strides, he came to stand nose to nose with her, so close a whisper couldn\u2019t pass. Her eyes widened, but before she could catch her breath Tristan swept her up, their lips nearly touching. His body shook, and he briefly wondered if he would fall over with pure joy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Andi stared at him, breathless, and for the first time, unable to speak.</p><p>Tristan, on the other hand, had no trouble at all.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I vow you feel powerfully fair in my arms.\u201d</p> <p>She tried to make her mouth move, but nothing came forth. Her tear ducts, on the other hand, worked just fine. Tears slid down her face. She lifted a hand and hesitantly touched first his cheek, traced his eyebrows, then ran her fingers through his hair. The sensation nearly made him drop her. She looked back up and still found her tongue lacking the muscle to speak. Tristan found better uses for it.</p><p>He stared down at the woman in his arms. His woman. Her warmth spread across his bare chest, making his muscles quiver. Her trembling rocked him to the bone, even as he held her tight. He had dreamed of this moment for what seemed like eternity, and never did he believe it could possibly ever happen.</p><p>And yet he felt the weighty proof in his arms.</p><p>He searched her face with his eyes, not wanting to miss a single line, a single freckle\u2014wanting to miss nothing. His own hand shook as he took off his glove with his teeth and set it aside. Lifting his hand to her cheek, he grazed it with the back of his knuckles. He tried to speak again, but found a solid lump in his throat, robbing his breath. He swallowed past it. \u201cDamnation, Andrea, you\u2019re powerfully soft.\u201d He drew a deep breath, and his words flowed out on the exhale. \u201cI vow I could hold you here and stare at your beautiful face for the rest of my days.\u201d</p><p>He watched tear after tear slide down her cheek as she stared up at him with those warm hazel eyes. He could wait no more. He bent his head close, his gaze trained on hers as his mouth settled comfortably over quivering lips. So warm and soft, he found himself craving more. He brushed his lips across hers several times, then with strained control, deepened the kiss. When her hand grasped the back of his neck and pulled him closer, it sent him over the edge. He tasted her, deeper and deeper, swallowing her gasp of surprise.</p> <p>Tristan lifted his head from Andi\u2019s but didn\u2019t break eye contact. Their lips were a whisper apart, and he could do nothing save stare and thank God and the saints above he had been given such a gift. His breathing panted with the effort of having to maintain control. He wanted her so badly, his insides shook. Suddenly, a loud snort sounded in the bailey. Only when a brave soul tapped him on the shoulder did he remember where he was and who was about.</p><p>Tristan turned and glared at the snorter.</p><p>His entire garrison formed a half circle around him.</p><p>Tristan smiled down at Andi and set her back on the ground. He kept his arm tightly about her shoulder. She teetered a bit, and he gripped her tighter still. She stood, staring, eyes wide. Her lips moved and something came out, but, damn him, he couldn\u2019t understand a word. Saints, but he missed his uncanny hearing ability.</p><p>Lowering his head, he leaned toward her mouth. Her warm breath caressed his ear and neck, and he all but hit the floor from the impact of it. Shaking his head, he focused on her words.</p><p>Her question floated out on a whisper. \u201cHow?\u201d</p> <p>With a smile, he tapped her nose. \u201cNay, love. We\u2019ve got time for questions such as that later.\u201d His grin widened. \u201cI have another question for you, and by the saints, I must ask it now before my nerve deserts me.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze remained fixed on his, following him all the way down as he knelt on bended knee. He cleared his throat and grasped Andi\u2019s hand, unsure if the trembling came from hers or his own. More likely than not, \u2019twas both.</p><p>\u201cAndrea Kinley Monroe.\u201d His voice came out hoarse and scratchy. He hoped she didn\u2019t care. \u201cI beg you, wed me. I vow you\u2019ll not regret it.\u201d</p><p>He watched several more tears streak her reddened cheeks. A smile began in the corners of her mouth and crept into her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d So soft, he could barely hear her at first, but then she threw her arms about his neck and squeezed. \u201cYes! I\u2019ll marry you!\u201d</p><p>Whistles and bellowing cheers from his knights erupted across the bailey, drifting on a North Sea breeze. Tristan looked into his love\u2019s eyes and smiled, then stopped whatever words were about to make their escape from her lovely mouth. He, without a doubt in his medieval mind, kissed her good and sound, leaving no question as to how much he loved her.</p><p>And would do the like. Forever.</p><p>My vision clears and alights on Tristan\u2019s handsome face. I smile. \u201cOh, wow,\u201d I say. \u201cNow, that\u2019s romantic, for sure. So your now wife read the verse that undid the curse and set you and your knights free. Then once you materialized into human form you killed your murderer, and he turned into a big pile of grossness.\u201d I punch the big knight in his arm. \u201cQuite a story, Dreadmoor.\u201d</p> <p>Tristan\u2019s sapphire blue eyes twinkle in the light of Bene\u2019s streetlamp. \u201cAye, for a certainty.\u201d His stare is intense. \u201cAnd do not ever forget that, no matter how bleak something may appear, there is always hope.\u201d He smiles. \u201cEven hope in the most abnormal of times.\u201d</p><p>I give him a nod and a smile of understanding. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>With four large white plastic bags filled with batter-fried haddock, chips, and several meat pies that all smell heavenly, Tristan and I step out onto Canongate and into a misty Edinburgh night. A couple passes us at the entrance, and the woman, dressed in a pair of dark tights, a brown wool miniskirt, and a wool hat, meets my gaze.</p><p>I\u2019d already banked her features to memory.</p><p>She quickly looks away.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Tristan asks as we cross the street. I glance over my shoulder. The woman is staring at me through Bene\u2019s open doorway.</p><p>\u201cThat woman,\u201d I answer. \u201cShe\u2019s the woman who led the walking tour earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Poe, we passed at least three walking tours,\u201d Tristan says. \u201cWhat bothers you?\u201d</p><p>We move past Tolbooth Tavern and into the archway of the wynd. I turn and glance back. The woman and man are both gone. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer. \u201cSomething about the way she looks at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you are a striking girl,\u201d Tristan answers. \u201cMight it just be that simple?\u201d</p><p>I give a short laugh as we near the Crescent\u2019s gates. \u201cI seriously doubt that.\u201d</p><p>We walk through the gates, and the moment we clear them they begin to close. Gravel crunches beneath our boots as we cross the courtyard, that ever-present and eerie angel in the fountain spurting water. Inside, the others are waiting for us in what Gabriel calls the common room. It sort of reminds me of Julian Arcos\u2019s great hall, with a large fireplace taking up most of one wall, and several chairs, a sofa, and a large center table. On the walls, shelves of ancient-looking books. In the corner, an enormous desk with several volumes of . . . something opened. Sydney sits there, her head bowed over one of them.</p><p>I find Eli, walk over to him. I peel out of my long overcoat, unstrap my sword, and set them both aside, then plop down on the floor in front of him. Grabbing one of the containers from Bene\u2019s, I open it and dig in to a slab of haddock. Bene had already drowned them and the chips with vinegar and brown stuff. I can barely shovel it in fast enough. I glance over at Tristan. He\u2019s doing the same thing. Gawan and Lucian both have a container in their laps, too. Jake stands near the hearth with Darius, and he turns to address the team.</p><p>\u201cRiley, I\u2019ve updated everyone on what happened at St. Giles\u2019,\u201d Jake says. \u201cConwyk has a theory.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Gawan, and he nods. \u201cAye,\u201d he says. \u201cRiley, tell me exactly what happened.\u201d</p><p>I finish chewing. \u201cThis kid, he was screaming, acting freaking crazy on the street, kicking over trash bins, and scaring people. He was holding his head as if it seriously hurt him. I . . . guess I sensed something was up. I grabbed his hands and we were suddenly in an alternate Edinburgh.\u201d I took a long pull on my Coke. \u201cI guess I thought to drag the kid into the cathedral because he reeked of death. His eyes\u201d\u2014I recall it in my memory\u2014\u201cthey weren\u2019t his. His voice, either. And I figured the cathedral was sanctuary. When we got inside, though, the church was all dilapidated and run-down. Abandoned.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cWeird.\u201d</p><p>Gawan glances first at Tristan, then at Gabriel. \u201cSounds like the Fallen have initiated a few henchmen from the other side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRather, henchsouls,\u201d says Darius. He runs his hand through his dark auburn hair, now hanging loose about his shoulders. He glances at me with his piercing gaze. \u201cYou killed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed it,\u201d I repeat. \u201cDon\u2019t know how, or what made me think to drown it out in that puddle, but something lured me there. The moment that . . . thing inside Ian saw itself in the puddle, in it went. Trapped.\u201d I make the sound effect of an explosion. \u201cBut for a second, before it popped and turned into some oil-like substance, it looked at me. And it seemed, I don\u2019t know, regretful. Or something.\u201d I shrug and continue eating.</p><p>\u201cYou didna kill a demon,\u201d Gawan said, and in his soft brown eyes I see pain. \u201cYou killed an Earthbound.\u201d</p><p>I swallow, glance at Jake, Darius, and then back to Gawan. \u201cAn Earthbound what?\u201d</p><p>Gawan\u2019s jaw muscles flex. \u201cAngel.\u201d</p><p>My heart stops.</p><p>\u201cThat thing inside of Ian? It was no angel, Gawan. It was evil. Evil as Hell. All except for that one split second.\u201d</p><p>Gawan nods. The firelight from the hearth flickers shadows over his face. \u201cThe Fallen use a curse to change them, which the Earthbounds can\u2019t stop. The spells of the Seiagh are too powerful, and the Fallen have saved several to memory. The Fallen trap unsuspecting Earthbounds and use them for their own devices. But you didna kill it. You just sent it to a horrible place.\u201d</p><p>A lump forms in my chest. \u201cIs there any way to retrieve the Earthbound from wherever I sent them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Sydney interrupts from her place at the desk. She turns and looks at me. \u201cYou have to go in after them.\u201d</p><p>I immediately feel Eli tense up behind me.</p><p>\u201cCan beings other than Earthbounds be sent to that place?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Gawan nods. \u201cAye.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo Ian\u2019s behavior wasn\u2019t a demon being evil,\u201d I say, finally catching on. \u201cIt was an Earthbound rebelling. Trying to get out.\u201d</p><p>Gawan nods again. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>I eye him, and even though I already know the answer after seeing into his memories, I want to hear him say it. \u201cYou know all that because you are an Earthbound?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas,\u201d Gawan corrects. \u201cFor centuries. I\u2019m a mere mortal now, like Dreadmoor.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m finally catching on to this twelfth and thirteenth century jive. Not only do both warriors have their given names, but they\u2019re also referred to by their home. Dreadmoor. Grimm. Confusing as hell, but I get it.</p><p>\u201cI was dead, though,\u201d Tristan adds. \u201cA bloody spirit, as were my men, for centuries on and on. Only did my fate change when a young Colonist happened upon my land.\u201d</p><p>I blink. \u201cYou were a ghost for centuries, yes?\u201d</p><p>Tristan nods. \u201cAye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike see-through, mists and orbs, or something different?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Tristan laughs. \u201cI appeared just as you see me now, with the exception of my garb. I looked very much alive.\u201d He rubs his chin. \u201cI do miss walking straight through walls, and just thinking of a spot I wished to occupy and then just . . . occupying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you miss it?\u201d Ginger asks. She\u2019s sitting next to Lucian on a long, brown leather sofa.</p><p>\u201cNay,\u201d Tristan clarifies. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade my Andrea for any of it.\u201d</p><p>Gawan looks at me. \u201cHis wife.\u201d</p><p>I look at Gawan.</p> <p>I decide my powers are all too useful all of a sudden.</p><p>And take a lot less time than verbal explanations.</p><p>Slowly, I reach over and brush Gawan\u2019s hand with mine.</p><p>Now I\u2019m Gawan of Conwyk . . .</p><p>Gawan walked close beside her, his arm not too tightly around her, and guided her across the glowing, glittery winter wonderland of Castle Grimm. With the tall, gray Grimm towers, and that giant mouth of a portcullis, it truly did look like something out of a fairy tale. On they walked to the courtyard, where in the spring dozens of flowers bloomed, Gawan said, and the border bumped straight up to the edge of the cliff. The moon hung over the choppy North Sea, and a light sprinkling of snow fell steadily. Gawan had told her how uncanny it was to get snow\u2014and this much of it\u2014at this time of year. Uncanny, he\u2019d said.</p><p>For Gawan of Conwyk to find anything uncanny was, well, uncanny.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to see this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ellie stopped and cocked her head. \u201cAre you kidding? Of course I want to.\u201d</p> <p>Gawan guided her to a stone bench set amidst the rose bushes overlooking the sea. \u201cYou sit here. I\u2019ll need to stand back a ways.\u201d He unbuttoned his coat. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t scream. \u2019Tis overwhelming, the sight of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t scream.\u201d</p><p>He gave a nod, dropped his coat and shirt, and looked at her, just before he walked off. Standing there, the moonlight painting his broad, muscular, tattooed chest in a pale glow, his shoulder-length curls tossing about him in the wind, Ellie appeared taken.</p><p>Only she hadn\u2019t yet seen Gawan\u2019s magnificent yet useless reminders that he\u2019d done something worthy once, several lifetimes ago.</p><p>And there, with the tumultuous North Sea roaring behind him and snowflakes falling about, stood Gawan of Conwyk. Born in \u201ca.d.\u201d 1115 A.D., died in A.D. \u201cA.D.\u201d 1145. Honor bound by his knightly vows; awarded in death a pair of guardian\u2019s wings to symbolize his selfless deeds. And as he closed his eyes and said the strange words that carried to Ellie\u2019s ears only because of the fierce midwinter\u2019s wind blowing directly at her, his wings unfolded from their hiding place within his shoulder blades and spanned nearly twelve feet, tip to tip. They\u2014he\u2014was the most astounding and glorious sight she\u2019d ever beheld.</p><p>Not for the first time since meeting the man, Ellie was speechless.</p><p>And within the blink of an eye, he\u2019d retracted those wings and was striding closer to her, silently, and when he got to her, she helped him into his shirt and coat, and he embraced her, his mouth buried into her neck.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t frighten you, did I?\u201d he asked against her skin.</p><p>Ellie held on tight. \u201cI\u2019m never scared with you.\u201d And wished she could stay there, enclosed within his arms, forever.</p><p>\u201cEven that wouldn\u2019t be long enough for me,\u201d Gawan whispered in her ear.</p><p>\u201cStay out of my head, Conwyk,\u201d she said, and he chuckled.</p><p>And she cried.</p><p>When I focus on Gawan of Conwyk\u2019s eyes, they soften. And, he smiles. \u201cDid you find what you seek?\u201d he asks softly.</p><p>I nod. \u201cFor now.\u201d I do know there\u2019s a helluva lot more to Gawan and Tristan than what meets the curious eye.</p><p>It was a lot to think about. Angels. Earthbounds. Demons. Jod\u00eds. Fallen. Vampires. Werewolves. Immortal druids.</p><p>And me. Whatever I am.</p><p>Weariness is starting to hit me. I\u2019m one of the only souls in the room who require sleep, except for the lupines. Not too sure about the druids. Even I require just a small amount these days.</p><p>\u201cRi, you need to rest for a bit,\u201d Eli says. He rubs my head, then explains. \u201cOne of the several side effects of her mortal DNA mixing with that of four vampires. She just falls out sometimes. Like a bad case of narcolepsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo rest,\u201d Jake says. \u201cWe\u2019ll be here when you wake up. We\u2019ve a lot to go over before Tristan and Gawan leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are they leaving?\u201d I ask. \u201cWouldn\u2019t their skills with the sword be helpful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I keep telling him,\u201d Tristan says, grumbling.</p><p>\u201cWhilst they are the verra best swordsman alive, in my opinion, they are mere mortals. They can be killed. And we\u2019re obviously dealing with a lot more than we at first assumed. Not just simply lopping off the heads of a Fallen or a Jod\u00eds. I\u2019ll not make their families suffer. The both of them have done enough of that in their lifetimes,\u201d Jake says.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Gawan says. \u201cDreadmoor already has six children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon to be seven,\u201d Jake corrects. \u201cAnd you\u2019re one to talk, Conwyk. Your bride has been pregnant more oft than not. Five babes now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that,\u201d Gawan replies, and he nods. \u201cAye, there is that, indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want them out of here before the Fallen rejuvenate. We\u2019ve one more day left, at best,\u201d Jakes says, then inclines his head toward the desk. \u201cSydney is pouring through the Celtae\u2019s old tomes. Only she can read them. Clues are hidden amongst the pages regarding the relics. Then we\u2019ll be hitting the streets.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI\u2019ll only rest for a bit.\u201d I push off the floor, grab my empty container and Coke bottle, and start toward the kitchen. Eli rises and follows me.</p><p>I catch the light switch with my elbow as I walk in, Eli behind me. The kitchen is a decent size, with a long wooden block top in the center, a pair of deep white porcelain sinks at the back, and a huge mahogany dining table. It looks old. Modern appliances fill the spaces, a double-sized stainless-steel, side-by-side fridge with a freezer drawer on the bottom, a dishwasher, and a stove. Above it, a mega microwave. In the far corner, the \u201cred\u201d fridge for the vamps. Some smart-ass has placed a magnet of a pair of long, white fangs on the front of the door. Funny.</p><p>\u201cImmortals eat a lot,\u201d Eli offers. He takes my trash, finds the receptacle, and dumps it. \u201cAlmost as much as humans with tendencies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d I remark, and slide my arms around his waist. His strong arms embrace me, and I feel drowsy just resting against his chest.</p><p>\u201cGo upstairs and get some sleep,\u201d he says against my hair, then kisses my temple. His lips move to my ear. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna need it, ch\u00e8re.\u201d</p><p>My heart leaps.</p><p>Eli laughs against my hair. \u201cI heard that.\u201d</p><p>Something hard presses against my abdomen. \u201cI feel that.\u201d</p><p>He laughs again. \u201cGo,\u201d he says, and turns me around and swats my ass. \u201cGo get some rest. You don\u2019t want to pass out onto the floor like you did at my parent\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that I could\u2019ve done without,\u201d I answer. \u201cEspecially with your idiotic brothers watching. Throwing things at me and laughing. So freaking juvenile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget my idiotic sister,\u201d he adds. \u201cShe laughed just as hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah and your mama scolded you all for it,\u201d I remind him.</p><p>\u201cTough woman, Elise Dupr\u00e9,\u201d he says.</p><p>To that I fully agree. And I miss her.</p><p>I wave good night to the team as I pass back through the common room and head for the stairs. In the foyer, it\u2019s dark with only a single lamp burning on a tall, small table. Shadows play on the wall as I go by, and I briefly wonder if it\u2019s me causing it or something else.</p><p>I climb to the second floor, and only when I hit the landing does a strange sensation come over me. I glance around, but see nothing except dim lights and shadows. I continue on. Stopping by the bathroom, I take care of girly business, wash up, and brush my teeth. I pull my jet-black hair into a floppy bun at the top of my head, and head out into the corridor. I take no more than a few steps before the sensation comes back full force. A whisper brushes my neck, close to my ear, and I whip around. My breath hitches.</p><p>At the end of the hall, back at the platform leading downstairs, is that creepy little girl from before. I blink. She\u2019s gone.</p><p>I half expect her to still be standing there, saying Come play with me. Forever.</p><p>I stare at the empty space for several seconds. I guess if Tristan can be a ghost for centuries, and I know that to be true, then the ghost of a little girl could be lingering here. Not optimal, since I don\u2019t have time for tricks and games and scares, but what the Hell. I turn and head to my room. I pull up short.</p><p>She\u2019s standing by my door.</p><p>I decide to play it cool.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I ask.</p><p>The little girl, with her severely pulled-back hair and white skin, simply stares. She says nothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Awkward.</p><p>With a sigh, I continue on. My narcolepsy is about to come on full strength. I need to find my bed. Uninterrupted by ghosts.</p><p>I stop a few feet from her. \u201cI\u2019m Riley. If you ever decide to talk\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Again, the little girl\u2019s mouth drops down into a crooked, exaggerated O, her eyes black and fathomless. But this time the scream pierces straight through my brain.</p><p>Then she lunges through me. My insides immediately feel icy.</p><p>I jerk around. She\u2019s not behind me.</p><p>Gone. Unless she\u2019s inside of me.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, if you change your mind, I\u2019m not bad to talk to. For an adult. And, for the record, you don\u2019t scare me. I kill vampires for a living.\u201d</p> <p>I decide I\u2019ll talk to Jake and Gabriel about her after I rest. Sydney and Gabriel both have lived here for a while. Have they had encounters with the little girl before? If not, why me? Why freaking me? I seem to be asking that a lot lately. Right now I feel like I\u2019m about to drop onto the floor. Seriously. I\u2019ve battled newlings and vamps. My poor neck has been latched on to by Julian Arcos, for Christ\u2019s sake. I still shudder at that memory. Saving my skin or not, he\u2019s just flat-out creepy. He even asked me to become his wife if things didn\u2019t work out with Eli. Really?</p><p>Considering all that, I can handle the screaming ghost of a little girl. And, for the record, I did look into her eyes. Nothing happened.</p><p>Inside my room, I bend down to kick off my boots.</p><p>Only then do I realize I\u2019m too late.</p><p>In the next second, I tip over. My body is flush with the floor. My eyes close.</p><p>It\u2019s as good a bed as any. . . .</p> <p>I\u2019m walking outside on the Mile, and I\u2019m alone. Although I can\u2019t say where I\u2019m headed, I know exactly where I\u2019m going. It\u2019s dark. It\u2019s raining. And after I pass St. Giles\u2019, I turn down a narrow close. Suddenly I\u2019m at a lone door. It\u2019s slightly opened, and I enter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d a voice says from inside. \u201cCome. You\u2019re just in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn time for what?\u201d I ask. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>I see a figure ahead of me, crouching by a long, threadbare sofa of blue-and-black plaid cloth. The figure keeps his back to me. He\u2019s large. Wearing a dark cloak with a hood.</p><p>\u201cTurn around and face me,\u201d I say, and he chuckles.</p><p>\u201cI cannot. Not now. You won\u2019t understand if I do.\u201d</p><p>I move in closer and notice a middle-aged man asleep on the sofa. On the table beside him, a half-finished pint of beer. The TV is silent, but the screen depicts a UK cop show. I look at the figure. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch.\u201d</p> <p>The figure waves his hand over the man\u2019s sleeping body, then rises. Although he moves toward me, he keeps his back to me. I slide my gaze back to the sleeping man, and his middle begins to smoke. Smolder. He awakens and yells out and begins to beat his stomach with his hands.</p><p>\u201cHelp me!\u201d he screams. \u201cChrist, help me!\u201d</p><p>I lunge toward him, but the figure grabs me, holds me back.</p><p>\u201cNay, girl,\u201d he says. \u201cYou cannot stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fuck I can\u2019t!\u201d I scream. I elbow him in the vicinity of his jaw. I make contact with something. \u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>The figure laughs softly. \u201cYour valor is impressive. But you cannot stop this.\u201d He turns and looks me in the eye, and I blink, staring. His face is . . . perfectly normal. Handsome. Older. With fathomless blue eyes that sear straight through me. Reaching with his cloaked arm, he sinks his fingers into the screaming man\u2019s chest and removes his heart. It\u2019s still beating. The man\u2019s screams intensify, then begin to die down. The smell of acrid smoke and charred flesh fills my nostrils. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p><p>I stare into those eyes. \u201cWatch me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Strong fingers wrap around my floppy-bun hairdo, and a firm hand grasps my shoulder and shakes me. I jump, gasp, and sit straight up. I take a swing at the man, and he ducks and barely misses my punch.</p><p>\u201cShh, ch\u00e8re,\u201d he says softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to frighten you.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m awake now. It\u2019s Eli. I\u2019ve had enough sleep. I don\u2019t know how much time has passed, but it\u2019s more than enough. \u201cYou never have frightened me, Dupr\u00e9,\u201d I say. \u201cBut someone is trying to.\u201d</p><p>Eli frowns. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Rubbing my eyes with my knuckles, I pretend I don\u2019t still smell the burning flesh of a human. \u201cI saw an innocent burn.\u201d</p><p>Eli sighs and pulls me to him. \u201cHow? Who?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cA middle-aged man. Just . . . asleep on his couch. The one there, the one who lured me there . . .\u201d I look at Eli. \u201cI think he was one of the Fallen. I saw him take the man\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Ri,\u201d he says, then looks at me. \u201cSo the Fallen really don\u2019t mind getting their hands dirty after all?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWe have to stop these guys,\u201d I say. \u201cFast. They have no conscience, Eli. None.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cNo telling how many more will die. And I think there\u2019s a lot more to the Fallen than even Jake and Gabriel, and Darius know.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cThey can do . . . anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get them, Riley,\u201d Eli assures me. \u201cI swear it.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI didn\u2019t hurt you, did I?\u201d</p><p>Eli laughs softly and stands me up. \u201cYou missed, so no.\u201d He wraps his arms around me and lowers his head. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even make it to the bed, ch\u00e8re. Just fell right onto the floor. And you\u2019re still wearing all your clothes, including your dirk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answer, burying my face in his neck. I wrap my arms around his waist. \u201cFloor worked just fine. Too tired to take everything off. Good thing I didn\u2019t impale myself with my blade on the way down.\u201d</p><p>His deep chuckle rumbles against my ear. We stand there a second or two, or maybe a minute. I suddenly can\u2019t quite get close enough, even after shifting a time or two. Maybe it\u2019s the clothing that\u2019s in the way?</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Eli says. He grabs my hair and pulls gently, forcing my head to tip back, making me look up at him. He lowers his head, his mouth hovering over mine.</p><p>\u201cJust being in the same room with you and not being able to have you for hours at a time stirs a need within me so fierce, it literally hurts.\u201d He dips lower, his lips brushing mine. Erotic. Inside, I shiver. \u201cDo you understand, ch\u00e8re?\u201d</p><p>Oh yeah, I sure do.</p><p>With light pressure, Eli nudges my mouth open with his, and at the same time he drops the hand holding my hair and grasps one of my hands. He lowers it, pulls it between us, and presses it against the bulge straining against his pants.</p><p>I smile and stretch my fingers and palm him, and he groans into my mouth, the sound desperate, hungry, determined.</p><p>A total turn-on.</p><p>Eli slides his tongue across my bottom lip and pulls it into his mouth, the pressure of the suck light, constant, then a little harder, a bit faster. The erotic, slick movement makes my pulse quicken, my breath catch. The cool metal buttons of his fly come loose under my fingers one by one.</p><p>Eli moves his mouth to my ear, his warm breath making my skin break out into goose bumps. He inhales. \u201cYou smell good,\u201d he whispers. His accent is thicker. Sexy as hell. Another big turn-on, and Eli knows it. I do as he asks. No problem. I mean, this vampire is mine. All mine. Eli smiles against my mouth. Our teeth bump together. We laugh. Then Eli\u2019s hands slide to my jaw, one on either side. With nothing more than the moonlight slipping in through the window, he locks a profound stare to mine. \u201cI am so in love with you, Riley Poe,\u201d he says quietly. He slides his fingers over my left hand and grazes the ring he gave me. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s words wash over me. Funny thing is, I allow it. Revel in it.</p><p>And I can actually say it back now.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so in love with you, Eligius Dupr\u00e9.\u201d I kiss his nose. \u201cIt actually took a vampire to claim my icy heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour heart has never been icy,\u201d he answers, and kisses me. He fingers the wings at my cheek. \u201cIt was just waiting on me.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping my arms around his neck, Eli lifts and settles me on his hips. I wrap my legs around his waist, and heat pools low, deep, and I press harder against him. He kisses me and he kicks the door shut behind us.</p><p>We fall against the closed door, and my fingers fumble behind me to lock it. The iron bolt digs into my spine, but I ignore it. I all but climb the length of him, digging my heels into his back, pressing the heat growing between my legs against his hard ridge. I thread my fingers through his hair and pull his head back to give me better access to his mouth. I take full advantage of it. I taste his lips. Bite. Lick. Then I kiss him deep, and my heart, surprisingly, beats a little faster. I feel restless inside, and it\u2019s growing more difficult to tolerate.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d I mutter on a gasp. \u201cNow, Eligius.\u201d</p><p>Eli lets me slide from my perch on his hips and pins me against the door. Eyes darkened by raging lust hold my gaze as he tugs the clasps of my thin leather straps and blade sheath, letting both drop to the floor. Grasping my snug shirt by the hem, the material slides over my skin as he pulls it off and tosses it onto the floor. Likewise, I pull his shirt over his head, drop it, and slip my palms over the chiseled muscles of his chest, lower, to his stomach, and around to the smooth contours of his hard, broad back. He buries his mouth against my neck, and I don\u2019t even tense up anymore.</p><p>Eli has that much control.</p><p>Turn-on.</p><p>With his fingertips, Eli slides the straps of my bra off my shoulders and unclasps it, and my heavy breasts are free of the silky material. My bra finds its way on the growing pile of clothes on the floor. The cool air brushes my skin, and one of Eli\u2019s hands finds my lower back and pulls me closer. He drops his head, kisses my collarbone, and moves lower, his lips dragging over the swell of my breast. Grabbing his hair, I pull his mouth to exactly where I want it. In an erotic kiss, he suckles me, makes my skin flame, and covers the other breast with his hand. I press my groin to his, closer, hot, aching. Shivers of pleasure rack my body each time his tongue and lips rake over the sensitive peak, causing the throbbing pulse between my thighs to pitch. I push my hands through his silky hair and hold on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mouth leaves my breast, the chilly air of the ancient chamber cooling my wet skin, and he lowers, kissing with tongue and teeth down my ribs. Goes down on one knee, drags his mouth over my navel, my hip. With adept fingers, he pulls off my boots, socks, unbuttons my dark jeans, pulls them down and off. All shoved away. Wasting no time, he hooks my panties, pushes them down, and pulls them off. Gone. My heart leaps. My breath stills in my lungs.</p><p>Those same adept fingers rise to my ribs, one hand on either side, and hold me firmly against the door. He teases first the inside of one thigh, then the other, fire pooling in all my sensitive places. I moan, about to lose my mind, and push his head down.</p><p>The moment Eli\u2019s tongue slides inside of me I explode, jerking against the cool wood of the door. Eli\u2019s fingers dig into the spaces between my rib bones. A sob escapes me. Can\u2019t help it. Can barely breathe.</p> <p>Then he rises and carries me to the bed. The room is bathed in a milky glow, and shadows reach, grasp, and miss. Eli sets me down and moves behind me, and his breath rakes against the bare skin of my neck. \u201cI want you forever,\u201d he says. \u201cI always want this.\u201d He nips my shoulder softly, causing me to shiver. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s boots, jeans, and boxer briefs are off and kicked away into a dark pile. When he finds me again, he presses the hard, carved stone of his chest against my back and I arch against it, and for a moment, his arms go around me, crossing over my stomach and pulling me close. There is no steady, fast thump of a heart hammering against me, but I feel his body quiver. He whispers I love you in French. I feel every ounce of strong, possessive emotion within him. All for me.</p><p>Eli turns me, moves over me, his weight resting on his forearm. With dark eyes filled with love, he studies me wordlessly. Then his mouth covers mine. His kiss is erotic, deep, slow. I wrap my legs around his waist, drag my heels down his calves.</p><p>Eli groans, and in one move he enters me. He sucks in a breath, stills, and murmurs more French words. They\u2019re muffled and I don\u2019t understand them.</p><p>His hard sex fills every inch of me, claiming its place deep within, and I hold on for dear life. He begins to rock, his hard thighs trapping me and his body crowding me.</p> <p>A slow arc of pleasure builds and fires, sending shards of blinding light scattering behind the lids of my eyes. A cry rips from my throat as the orgasm racks me, and at the same time Eli\u2019s own climax tears from him, over and over as he takes me possessively, claiming me in the most ancient of ways. Uncontrolled. Out of control.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>As we both crash back down to earth, Eli remains inside of me, slowly moving, his breath coming in harsh puffs against my neck as his mouth kisses me. His arms are wrapped tightly around me, holding me tightly against him, and I feel more emotion, more love, in that full-body embrace than even the words themselves.</p><p>It\u2019s that powerful. It\u2019s that beautiful.</p><p>And I never, ever want it to end.</p><p>Part Six</p> <p>DEMENTED ANGELS</p><p>I am never so frightened as when every thing is still.</p><p>\u2014Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, The Parasite</p><p>If anything ever happens to Riley, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll survive it. My love for her has quadrupled since I first realized I loved her. She fits me perfectly, and I want her for as long as we have together. The thought that something as powerful as a Black Fallen can manipulate her in her sleep petrifies me. She thinks she can handle herself in all situations, and for the most part, she can. But with a Fallen? I\u2019m not so sure. They\u2019ve already homed in on her. It\u2019ll be up to me to keep her safe.</p><p>\u2014Eli Dupr\u00e9</p><p>The thought that I\u2019ve sent an Earthbound angel to some godforsaken plane of torture and hideousness plagues me. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. I know I will have to rectify it. If it kills me, I\u2019ll rectify it. The look in Ian\u2019s eyes, the eyes of the Earthbound, haunts me. It\u2019s compelling. Profound. I see it in my head, constantly.</p><p>It pisses me off.</p><p>I\u2019m ready to find the Fallen and kick their asses.</p> <p>The team practices for another day. Tristan and Gawan\u2019s lessons are invaluable. They are truly master swordsmen, and I can only imagine what they would\u2019ve been like in their prime. Well, they are in their prime; neither of them look a bit over their midthirties. But I mean in their original prime.</p><p>They\u2019re tough as shit, too, and they cut no slack where their students are concerned. Vampires don\u2019t sweat, but immortals do and so do the lupines. And so does a human with tendencies. They worked my ass to the bone, both of them. After we went through hours of stances, we were finally given the blades. Not easy. And not nearly as easy as the little blades I\u2019m used to working with. Hell, you aim and throw. Or you stab. With a sword you have to watch your back. And your own appendages.</p><p>After, we paired up. At first our mentors took turns with each of us. Tristan is truly a unique guy to engage in swordplay. You wouldn\u2019t think someone that big could move so elegantly. He makes it look effortless.</p><p>It\u2019s a sham. It\u2019s hard as Hell.</p><p>But we stuck it out, and although we get the fast version of Swordplay for Dummies, we all get the gist of it. In the Crescent\u2019s courtyard, Jake has set up several dummies for head lopping. Again, not as easy as it looks in the movies. One big swing and off goes the head. Nuh-uh. You\u2019d better hit that neck at just the precise mark, and you\u2019d better have all your damn weight behind your swing. Or else it\u2019ll hang. And squirt stuff.</p><p>Not pretty.</p><p>And not effective. Apparently, if you don\u2019t completely sever the head, the Fallen and the Jod\u00eds can regenerate. I almost want to do it just to watch. Sick, I know. But if anything, I\u2019m truthful.</p><p>Sydney\u2019s the only one missing in our training. She\u2019s already mastered the sword, thanks to a year with Gabriel, and she\u2019s been assigned the task of going through the sacred tomes of the Celtae, courtesy of Darius. He\u2019s another one that amazes me. It\u2019s weird to have seen him, as well as Jake, Tristan, and Gawan, in a time other than this one. It\u2019s a surreal occurrence, yet . . . it really happened. They lived in another time, one wilder, untamed\u2014a place where your sword was your protection.</p><p>Or, in Tristan\u2019s case, not.</p><p>I found out a few other things about him. Tristan\u2019s wife? Forensic archaeologist. She, after excavating, digging, researching, and falling in love with a spirit, reversed the curse and brought not only Tristan back to life, but all of his knights. One, the youngest, is picking up Tristan and Gawan in a little while, and so I\u2019ll get to meet yet another once-ghost. Even saying it inside my head sounds weird. But it happened. Almost as weird as a tattoo artist from Savannah, Georgia, being engaged to an aged vampire.</p><p>And Gawan. An Earthbound angel for centuries, he was on the brink of retirement. Was ready to become a full-fledged mortal, live out his life, and die. And just when he was about to retire, whack! He found a soaking-wet girl who claimed to be named Ellie on the road near his castle. She turned out to be a girl In Betwixt. Dead, but not. Ghostly, but not always. In and out. Yeah, they fell in love. Of course they did. The story would suck if they didn\u2019t. She also happened to be his intended. His soul mate.</p><p>I get that. Mine\u2019s a bloodsucker.</p><p>Gawan had to find Ellie\u2019s half-dead real self before she actually expired. He did. Now they\u2019re married, madly in love, and have a flock of children.</p><p>Blows my mind to hear it. And if all that can happen? Anything can happen. Good or evil. And that makes me know I\u2019d best be on my toes, in tip-top shape. Ready for any damn thing.</p><p>We spend the latter part of the afternoon on the streets of Edinburgh. Wet Edinburgh. Wet, cold, mist-shrouded Edinburgh. Still a cool old city. But from someone who is used to the southeastern coast of the United States, it takes a little getting used to.</p><p>We move through the streets, the closes and wynds, Grassmarket and Cowgate. Gabriel takes us through the vaults, or the catacombs, of underground Edinburgh. He says we\u2019ll need to know the city inside and out once the Fallen have regenerated. The vaults are eerily cold and dark, and throughout most of them only candles, occasionally lit by walking tour staff members, light the passageways.</p><p>All at once, I sense it. The others do, too. Another vampire. No sooner does the thought enter my head than a scream pierces the cold corridors of the vaults. In a flash, Victorian races ahead of me and disappears through an archway. He\u2019s already morphed. When next I look, so have all the other vampires in my company. We all follow Victorian\u2019s lead, through the shadowy passages of the vaults, and the screams grow more intense. I can tell the vampire is young, a girl. And in horrific pain. Like lightning, we fly through the tunnels, and at once we all come to a halt. We\u2019re now in a large chamber. Victorian has a human by the throat, holding him high. Four other humans fill the chamber. And chained to a wall, a girl. Rather, a female vampire. Older than I figured. Maybe twenty. Her merlot eyes are wide, and she stares at Victorian.</p><p>\u201cArcos, don\u2019t,\u201d Jake instructs Victorian.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t deserve this!\u201d Victorian yells. His eyes are latched onto the human in his grasp.</p><p>\u201cPut him down or I\u2019ll run you through,\u201d another human says. She holds a silver dirk, strapped to the end of a long wooden stick. It touches Victorian\u2019s back.</p><p>Just that fast, I\u2019m there, the silver blade knocked from the woman\u2019s hand. I shove her across the chamber and she hits the wall. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat\u2019d she do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you murderers all do,\u201d another woman, huddled against the wall, says.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cWhat did she do?\u201d I repeat.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what she will do!\u201d the remaining human, a middle-aged man, says. He steps closer, glancing at the one Victorian has suspended in the air.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good enough,\u201d Jake says. He looks at them all. \u201cVictorian, put him down.\u201d</p><p>Vic lets the man fall to the floor, where he scrambles up and huddles with the others.</p><p>\u201cNow leave,\u201d Jake says. And without another word, they all do exactly as he says.</p><p>Victorian hurries to the female vampire. \u201cRiley?\u201d he calls. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I go to him, and he nods to the chains. They\u2019re made of pure silver. No wonder Vic hadn\u2019t broken them himself yet. Grasping first one, then the other, I yank them out of the wall. Then, I pry them off of the girl. I study her. Her eyes are pale now. And she looks absolutely terrified. \u201cShe\u2019s not a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Victorian corrects. He looks at her. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s gaze flashes to all of us before returning Vic\u2019s question. Her brows furrow, as if she\u2019s thinking really hard. \u201cAbbey,\u201d she answers in a heavy brogue. \u201cI think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you have family?\u201d Gabriel asks.</p><p>Abbey shakes her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel nods. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe now,\u201d he assures her. \u201cArcos, bring her along.\u201d</p><p>I watch in fascination as Vic gingerly helps the somewhat-vamp girl out of the chamber. Gabriel turns to Jake. \u201cI know a place to take her. Arcos can accompany us.\u201d</p><p>Jake nods. \u201cAye.\u201c</p> <p>Then Gabriel and Vic leave with Abbey. We all follow behind, but instead of leaving out of the vaults, Gabriel leads them down a long passageway in the opposite direction. I stare until the darkness swallows them up.</p><p>I glance at Eli. \u201cThat was weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as weird as you think,\u201d Jake answers. \u201cEdinburgh has more than one human group of ghost hunters and monster chasers. They were spot on with this one, though. She\u2019s no\u2019 far from changing into full-potency vampire. He shakes his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to find out who her maker is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they be able to save her?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Jake\u2019s green gaze meets mine. \u201cMayhap.\u201d</p><p>Finally, a way out of the catacombs. We enter through an unobtrusive doorway and exit through a pub. Out on the street, the strained sounds of a bagpipe echo off the stone.</p> <p>I think I have the general makeup of the city engrained in me. No, I don\u2019t know each close and wynd, but I see how they work. Just like Savannah runs in squares, Edinburgh runs on the fish spine. I get it.</p><p>It rains all day. The oiled canvas coat I wear keeps me dry, for the most part. As the daylight fades, we find ourselves on Princes Street, and the hustle and bustle of tourism and nightlife are just kicking up. The imposing Gothic spires of the Scott Monument draw my attention, and I think before I leave Edinburgh I\u2019d like to do a little crazy free running. If my brother, Seth, could see this place, he\u2019d be all over it.</p><p>By the time light fades into shadows, we\u2019re back at the Crescent. Gabriel and Victorian have returned and now join us. We all mill in the courtyard. Tristan begins to argue about leaving.</p><p>I knew he would.</p><p>\u201cMy wife would encourage me to stay,\u201d Tristan argues. \u201cI cannot in good conscience leave you all here, knowing what you face. What the people, mortals of Edinburgh, face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor can I,\u201d adds Gawan.</p><p>\u201cYou can use the extra blades,\u201d Tristan adds.</p><p>Jake pinches the bridge of his nose.</p> <p>\u201cIf we get into a desperate situation, we\u2019ll call you,\u201d Gabriel says, then looks at me. \u201cYou wouldna argue if you knew the full potential of that one.\u201d He inclines his head toward me.</p><p>\u201cI know she has multiple senses, mind powers that I do not have,\u201d Tristan says. He looks at me. \u201cNo disrespect, Ms. Poe, but you simply lack the strength of a man. You are, after all, a female.\u201d He glances toward Ginger. \u201cUnlike Ms. Slater, who is lupine\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tristan jerks around, because he\u2019s now talking to thin air. In the split second it takes him to look away, I have made two leaps. One toward that hideous yet weirdly attractive angel fountain; two, the gargoyle on the far side of the Crescent. I\u2019m now on the ledge of the rooftop, looking down. I\u2019m watching that big, bulky knight look everywhere but up. Bending over, I pick up a loose stone, search for a bigger one, and find it, then throw them both at him. One bounces off his head, the other\u2014the larger\u2014off his ass.</p><p>Tristan curses, then spins around. He looks up, and I wave.</p><p>\u201cDamn me,\u201d he says, low and under his breath. He turns back and faces Jake and Gabriel. \u201cAye, so she can jump and apparently climb. But\u2014 damn!\u201d</p><p>Just that fast I leap down and onto Tristan\u2019s back. I flip him over, we fall to the gravel, and I land on top of him. He lets out a deep grunt. I pin his massive arms above his head, his tree-trunk legs trapped beneath mine, and I allow him to struggle for a few seconds. I almost can\u2019t stand it. I want to burst out laughing.</p><p>For a full minute, I let him struggle.</p><p>Only when he becomes winded do I grin. \u201cIs that your sword, Dreadmoor, or are you just happy to see me?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cGet off me, woman!\u201d Tristan bellows, but his lips twitch.</p><p>Before I jump up, I take one more look. I can\u2019t help it. Tristan de Barre is just too damn fascinating not to. With a smile, I take his hand in mine. And hold it.</p><p>A very small number of people attended the celebration. Live people, that is. Jameson; his son, Thomas, who looked just like Jameson; Miss Kate; her daughter; and Heath, the priest, to name a few. Tristan and his knights, of course. Even Constable Hurley showed up. Dreadmoor had quite a haunted reputation, but there were a few who put their fears aside and dared to come forth.</p><p>The remainder of the guests were restless spirits, ghosts from all corners of England, Scotland, and France. They had poured in through the front gates in droves, just to see the arrogant Dragonhawk and his lady wed. The news had apparently traveled fast, because there were knights and warriors of all shapes and ages littering the bailey, the lists, the great hall and chapel\u2014ghosts Andi had not once laid eyes on.</p><p>By the time the sun began its descent and the sky turned various shades of purple, gray, and orange, Tristan had threatened to toss her over his massive shoulders and haul her to the kirk. She wouldn\u2019t have minded, really. Not one little bit.</p><p>As Jameson led her to the staircase, her heart began to pound. That is, until her eyes landed on Tristan. Dragonhawk.</p><p>Then her poor heart nearly stopped.</p><p>The groom-to-be stood at the foot of the stairs, speaking with his captain. Kail must have announced her, because Tristan\u2019s head turned. He stared, a feral glint lighting his eyes, a muscle tightening in his cheek.</p><p>Jameson led her down the stairs, and it was a damn good thing, too. She would have surely tripped had he not been holding her steady.</p><p>Jameson approached Tristan, gently placed her hand on his arm, then stepped aside and gave Andi a low bow.</p><p>The lord of Dreadmoor all but robbed her of breath. He was so big. His very presence demanded respect and authority and power, and reeked of self-confidence. It lingered in each and every knight\u2019s eye, whether live or ghostly.</p><p>He wore his mail\u2014new, of course\u2014as did the other knights. Dark hose strained to cover his massive calves and thighs, followed by boots and a black surcoat. The mystical Dragonhawk, same as the one on his shield, was stitched on the front, its head thrown back as though issuing a mighty command. Its eye eerily glowed the same shade of sapphire as Tristan\u2019s. More of Kate\u2019s beautiful handiwork. His sword, now polished and gleaming, hung low on his lean, narrow hips. But something was odd.</p><p>The sapphire stone was missing from the hilt. It\u2019d been filled in with a black stone. Onyx?</p><p>A voice, deep and raspy, growled in her ear.</p><p>\u201cLady, you\u2019re gaping. I vow \u2019tis immensely satisfying.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth lifted. \u201cNo doubt.\u201d</p><p>He caught and held her gaze, and the impact alone nearly knocked her over. Love and desire shone bright and intense in his eyes. She couldn\u2019t have torn her gaze away had she tried.</p><p>Not that she would want to try, of course.</p><p>\u201cYou are passing beautiful, Andrea. I am the luckiest man in the entire world\u2014dead or alive.\u201d He grinned, gave her a quick peck on the tip of her nose, and then lifted his gloved hand to her chin. Tilting her head, he lowered and whispered words meant only for her. Warm breath caressed her ear. \u201cGod, I love you.\u201d He stared a moment longer, then straightened and tucked her hand in the crook of his arm. \u201cLet\u2019s be off to the kirk. I am ready to wed you.\u201d</p><p>Andi grinned and looked up\u2014ghost medieval knights stared at her and Tristan, some more fierce-looking, a few no more than fifteen or sixteen years old.</p><p>Jason, bless his sweet soul, stood close by. He grinned at the pair and led them through the gathering of men. \u201cThis way, my lord and lady. Move you, men there, and make way.\u201d</p><p>Jameson awaited across the great hall, door open and lanterns lighting the path outside to the kirk. They passed through the doorway, followed by Tristan\u2019s garrison and no less than one hundred ghostly knights.</p><p>A slight salty breeze wafted across the bailey. Andi lifted the hem of her gown with the one free hand she had, so as not to stumble. At the rate at which Tristan pulled her, it was a miracle her feet even managed to light on the ground.</p><p>Maybe he was in a big hurry.</p><p>Standing now at the front of the small chapel, they turned their attention to the priest waiting for them. He opened a large, leather-bound ledger and began to scribble.</p><p>Jameson stood to her left and behind her. Jason took a place beside Jameson. Kail stood on Tristan\u2019s right side. The rest of the Dragonhawk knights stood in a line behind them. Kate and her small family lined the wall on Andi\u2019s left. The small kirk was literally filled to the brim with the remaining ghostly knights and warriors who\u2019d traveled to Dreadmoor.</p><p>The plain, weathered stone kirk suited Andi just fine. Torches lit the room, their flickering flames casting a warm glow. Tristan had her hand tucked safely within his own as they faced the priest. She held on to him so tight, his mail pressed into her skin. Then, before they knew it, the priest began the ceremony in Latin. He turned to Andrea and Tristan, repeating the words in English.</p><p>\u201cTristan de Barre, Dragonhawk of Dreadmoor, how take ye this woman, Andrea Kinley Monroe?\u201d</p><p>Tristan cleared his throat, turned, and stared down at her. The dimples pitted deeply into his cheeks, although he didn\u2019t smile. There was that intense look, the very one that made her completely senseless. Her knees swayed a bit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI take this woman as my own, in the name of our father.\u201d His deep voice washed over her like a wave. \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>The priest nodded, then turned his dancing blue gaze to her. \u201cAnd you, Andrea Kinley Monroe of Virginia. How take ye this man?\u201d</p><p>Andi turned to Tristan, and as soon as she looked into his blue eyes, so full of love, the tears started to roll down her cheeks. \u201cI take this man as my own, in the name of our father.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cForever.\u201d</p> <p>Tristan reached a gloved hand and caught the trail of tears with his finger. His heart filled with joy.</p><p>The priest turned the ledger around on the table before them and nodded. Tristan took the pen, dipped it in ink, and signed his name. He dipped it once more and handed the pen to Andi. Her hands trembled as she signed.</p><p>The priest nodded. \u201cIn the name of our Holy Father and before these witnessing souls, \u2019tis done.\u201d He turned to Tristan. \u201cYou, my lord, may now kiss\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d Tristan grinned at the priest then pulled Andi into a tight embrace, lowered his head, and captured her lips, then proceeded to kiss her senseless right in front of the entire garrison and gathered ghosts. Shouts and cheers erupted around the small ancient chapel, but Andi barely noticed.</p><p>What girl in her right mind would have while at the mercy of a chivalrous knight such as Tristan de Barre? The renowned Dragonhawk.</p> <p>Her husband.</p><p>Tristan broke the kiss, gave her a quick peck on the nose, and grinned. She looked down at her hand.</p><p>On her finger sat the most beautiful wedding ring. A wide silver band with a lovely sapphire setting in the center. Her head snapped up. \u201cThis is from your sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Tristan produced another ring, much larger than the one on her finger. \u201cI had this one fashioned, as well.\u201d One corner of his mouth lifted in a charming grin. \u201cSo we would match.\u201d</p><p>Andi smiled, took the ring from his palm, and tugged off Tristan\u2019s glove. She pushed the ring into place and stared up at her husband. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, my love, are beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>Tristan swept her up into his strong arms and took off down the short aisle of the kirk, heading for the doorway.</p><p>Jameson hurried after them, Kate by his side, grinning and waving at the same time. \u201cMy lord and lady, wait!\u201d He panted as he ran. \u201cA feast has been prepared!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell done, Jameson,\u201d Tristan shouted over his shoulder. \u201cHave it sent up to my chambers posthaste.\u201d</p><p>Andi turned and glanced behind her as they left the kirk. Jason laughed, a broad smile lighting up his face. Kail slapped Sir Richard on the back, sending him sprawling. Jameson simply stood in the aisle, grinning. Andi waved and held on to her husband for dear life.</p><p>He carried her across the bailey and through the great hall. Even as Tristan held the treasured bundle in his arms, he could scarce believe his good fortune. Andi stared up at him with wide eyes as he climbed the staircase. He flashed her a quick grin.</p><p>\u201cLady Dragonhawk, I vow you\u2019ll force me to lose my footing if you do not cease looking at me with such affection. \u2019Tis unnerving.\u201d</p><p>Andi giggled. \u201cYou\u2019re full of it, Dreadmoor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, for a certainty. Moon away, love.\u201d Tristan reached the top of the stairs and stopped. He studied every inch of his bride\u2019s lovely face, from her greenish-flecked eyes to her full, inviting lips. When her hand snaked around his neck and pulled him closer, it was nearly his undoing.</p> <p>He bent his head and brushed her lips with his. Her sweet mouth trembled, and his poor knees wanted to buckle from the emotions it ignited within him. His throat tightened, so he swallowed. Twice. It did no good. Damn bothersome lump.</p><p>With long strides he started up the passageway and pulled to a halt just before plowing into his young knight.</p><p>Tristan glared. \u201cDamnation, Jason. How\u2019d you manage to get here first? Move you away.\u201d</p><p>Jason smiled at Andi and blushed. \u201cShall I guard your door, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Tristan walked past the boy and opened his chamber door. \u201cAye, and guard it with enthusiasm, pup.\u201d He kicked the door shut with his foot.</p><p>\u201cAye, my lord!\u201d Jason shouted from the other side.</p><p>Tristan glanced down at his lady, who gave him a bright smile. \u201cHe is very sweet,\u201d she said.</p><p>Tristan shook his head. \u201cThat sweet lad,\u201d he said, tossing his head in the direction of the door, \u201chas killed more men in battle than you could fathom. I daresay \u2019tis best he knows you now, instead of when he was alive in the thirteenth century. The pup blushes at the mere sight of you.\u201d He grinned. \u201cYou would have been the death of him, lady.\u201d He brought his head closer. \u201cAs you would have me.\u201d He brought his lips down to hers. \u201cDo not close your eyes, Andrea of Dreadmoor.\u201d His command whispered against her mouth. \u201cI want you to see what you do to me.\u201d</p><p>She forced her eyes to remain open as Tristan brushed his lips across hers, their eyes locked. He pulled back, then softly brushed them again. Arms of steel tightened around her, his muscles tense. He slowly set her on her feet, his eyes never leaving hers. Large callused hands skimmed her skin as he framed her face.</p><p>Her head held captive, Tristan lowered his mouth and kissed her, brushing his lips across hers over and over, his fingers kneading her scalp, tracing the shell of her ear, as he deepened the kiss. Her breath escaped as he tasted her lips with his tongue, softly at first, then possessive, demanding. Reaching up, she entwined her fingers in his long, silky hair and pulled him closer.</p><p>A low moan escaped him and, his breathing harsh, he said, \u201cHelp me out of this mail, woman, for I vow I cannot do it alone.\u201d</p><p>With trembling fingers, Andi helped him out of the heavy-gauge steel. Once free, he stepped toward her and in one swift move scooped Andi back into his arms. In two strides he stood at their bed.</p><p>Following her down to the softness of the duvet, he kissed her neck, her ears, her throat. Nerves she didn\u2019t even know existed tingled with sensation.</p><p>Tristan, breathless, lifted his head and held her gaze. \u201cGod, Andrea.\u201d A rush of warm breath sent a shiver across her skin as his deep, accented voice whispered against her ear. \u201cI cannot get enough of you.\u201d</p><p>Tristan\u2019s large hands shook as he unlaced her gown. The fire in his eyes smoldered as he slowly removed each layer of lace and then, without a word, shed his own clothes, never once dropping his gaze. He came to her, stretched out above her, and kissed her until she couldn\u2019t breathe.</p><p>Skin to skin, body to body, they moved, and when Tristan claimed her, his gaze never faltered. Watching her intently, his own wonder of discovery turned his eyes a dark, tumultuous blue-gray.</p><p>Tears spilled over her lids, and as Tristan brushed a tender kiss across her lips, he whispered against her mouth, his voice hoarse with emotion.</p><p>\u201cI would gladly wait another seven hundred years for your love, Lady Dreadmoor.\u201d He caressed her jaw with his callused knuckles. \u201cI love you, Andrea de Barre.\u201d He rested his forehead against hers. \u201cI will love you forever.\u201d</p><p>When I refocus, Tristan is searing me with a sapphire blue gaze. \u201cWhat did you find out this time, my lady?\u201d</p><p>I grin, jump up, and extend my hand once more. He takes it and stands to his full height. I look up. Way up. \u201cWow. All that kick-ass knightliness all rolled into a big pile of mush.\u201d I exaggerate my sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s like a fairy tale.\u201d</p><p>Tristan laughs. \u201cAye, \u2019tis, in truth. But keep to yourself the mushy part. I\u2019ve a reputation to uphold, girl. A fierce one. Not one of a pansy.\u201d</p><p>I laugh and punch Tristan\u2019s arm. \u201cYou got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn me,\u201d he says, and slaps my shoulder. I buck forward. \u201cI renounce my earlier claim. You may fight any battle beside me. Or ahead of me.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cThanks. And back at ya.\u201d I slap Tristan on the back. \u201cFor a mere mortal, you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>Lifting my hand, he drops a light kiss there. \u201cAnd I believe you\u2019re way more than a mere human with tendencies, Ms. Poe.\u201d</p><p>I give him a slight nod of thanks.</p><p>Just then, a pair of headlights bobs up and down over the cobbles at the entrance of Tolbooth Wynd. They stop at the gates to the Crescent. Two short blasts from the horn echo in the courtyard.</p><p>\u201cOy, young Jason is here,\u201d Gawan says. He has walked closer to me and lays a hand on my shoulder. \u201cIt has been a pleasure meeting you, lady,\u201d he says. \u201cI will give you a bit of advice about Earthbounds. Firstly, the spell in which the Fallen have chosen is a powerful one. Only another spell from the Seiagh can counteract it, which you dunna have.\u201d He looks down at me. The light from the courtyard lamp glints off his eyes. \u201cBut you\u2019ve the strength to save them, should you find it in yourself to do so. To go after them, though, is a tricky thing indeed. There\u2019s not always a convenient puddle of holy water lying about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNot only must you be touching the soul in which the Earthbound has been forced to take over, but you must also be submerged in the conduit yourself. Rather, a piece of you. Hand. Foot. Finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe conduit?\u201d I question.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Gawan answers. \u201cGlass. Mirror. Water. Reflections, Ms. Poe. But,\u201d he continues, and his expression turns grim. \u201cYou must be armed, and you must be careful. Once the Earthbound is trapped inside the conduit, it cannot harm you. It might no longer look like its Earthbound self, but you can tell by the eyes. Their eyes are their own. And as you\u2019ve seen, they\u2019re regretful. Sad. Pleading.\u201d</p><p>I nod in understanding. \u201cWhat can hurt me? And what can I take in the conduit to kill it?\u201d</p><p>Eli has moved close to me, stands besides me now. I know he hates this conversation. I feel his entire body crowd the space I\u2019m already in. Luckily, I love the feeling. And, thankfully, even though that possessive, protective bone still resides in Eligius Dupr\u00e9\u2019s body, he keeps it tucked there. Unless it absolutely has to come out.</p><p>Gawan knows it, too, because he gives Eli a respectful glance before continuing. \u201cYou\u2019ll be on another plane, like the one you were on earlier with the boy,\u201d Gawan explains. \u201cUsually the geography is the same, but,\u201d he goes on, \u201cthere are things even I don\u2019t get the full gist of in there. They hide, and in there they reign, preferably in darkness. And, yes, I am speaking of demons, Ms. Poe. And they\u2019re not nearly as easy to tackle as a thirteenth-century knight,\u201d he says with a glance at Tristan. \u201cOr even a vampire.\u201d He looks at Eli. \u201cThey\u2019re cunning, there are a lot of them, they toy with your mind, and they want only one thing: your soul.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Again I nod. \u201cAnd I kill it with . . . ?\u201d</p><p>He presses something into my hand. \u201cPrayer,\u201d Gawan says, \u201cand this.\u201d</p><p>In my palm, a cross. It\u2019s old. Old as dirt.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Pictish,\u201d he says, and pulls up the sleeve of his coat The muscles in his forearm flex as he turns it over, inside facing out. \u201cJust like this one. It will protect you for a time.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him.</p><p>\u201cAnd you have to repeat this prayer,\u201d he says. \u201cIn Pictish.\u201d</p><p>I think about it and nod. \u201cThe prayer and cross protect me . . . for a certain amount of time. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason!\u201d Tristan bellows.</p> <p>\u201cAye!\u201d a young voice replies. I turn and glance over my shoulder in time to see a young guy\u2014tall, lean, dark hair pulled back\u2014leap from the Rover that just pulled into the gates. He\u2019s jogging toward us, carrying something.</p><p>\u201cTake that to Grimm,\u201d Tristan says, referring to Gawan.</p><p>Jason hurries over to us. He has a wide smile and seems excited to see, well, everyone. \u201cSir Gawan!\u201d he says, stopping just before he plows into the big ex-warlord. \u201cHere you are, just as requested.\u201d He hands the thing to Gawan, then looks at me. A sparkle lights his eyes. \u201cLady,\u201d he says, and gives a slight bow. \u201cJason, presently of Dreadmoor.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cNice to meet you, Jason.\u201d</p><p>Gawan hands me the thing Jason has brought him.</p><p>I grasp it and look at it in the lamplight. The team moves in around me. Eli is all but pressed against my back. I turn it over in my hand. It\u2019s . . . a gun. Sort of. Looks like a handgun, but the place for a magazine is different. I hold it up and inspect the loading mechanism.</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Tis a scathe, lady. Known in our day as a skatha. Made of bronze and modified somewhat, by Sir Gawan there.\u201d Jason nods toward Conwyk. \u201cYou\u2019ll need this, but take care of the points,\u201d Jason says, and pulls a handful of clear, heavy glass cartridges the size of a ChapStick tube and places them in my other hand. At one end, extremely sharp and pointy. I look at him, and he seems overjoyed to be giving them to me. He\u2019s cute, don\u2019t get me wrong. Dead cute. I\u2019m just . . . befuddled.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re prefilled,\u201d Jason offers as I stare at them. \u201cI\u2019ve a score more of them in the Rover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cWhy, the only thing that will eradicate a demon,\u201d Jason answers. \u201cA very strong, very powerful, very magical source,\u201d he continues. \u201cPictish holy water from St. Beuno\u2019s Well.\u201d He cocks his head. \u201cHave you heard of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Fraid not,\u201d I answer. I stare at the liquid in the clear vials, then meet Gawan\u2019s gaze. \u201cI trust you. One cartridge per demon, loaded into the scathe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Gawan answers. \u201c\u2019Tis mighty holy, Riley. Be verra, verra careful with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cHere. I\u2019ll show you how to load them,\u201d Jason says, then looks down at me. \u201cIf you please?\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t think in a thousand years I\u2019ll ever, ever get used to medieval beings living in the twenty-first century. Never.</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I answer, and Jason gently takes the scathe and a cartridge and loads it. \u201cPull back this lever here,\u201d he says, showing me, \u201cand just slip it in. Give it a push\u201d\u2014he does so, and it clicks\u2014\u201cand lock the lever back in place. You can load six at once. When you\u2019re finished, pull the lever back down.\u201d He does, and hands me the gun. \u201cAnd you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jason,\u201d I say. \u201cAny suggestions on where to stash it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jason says sternly. \u201cYou\u2019ll not want to sheathe this, lady. \u2019Twill be best to keep it in your hand at all times.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Gawan, and he nods. After a quick look around, I see the entire WUP team is watching with intense curiosity. Ginger blinks, a look of astonishment on her face. Lucian simply stares. Noah, of course, is grinning.</p><p>Victorian, much like Eli, is frowning. And I can feel Eli\u2019s scowl.</p><p>\u201cAny questions?\u201d Gawan asks.</p><p>\u201cUm, yes,\u201d I say. \u201cThe prayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got that,\u201d Jason says, and pulls something from his pocket. He unfolds the paper and hands it to me. \u201cSir Gawan will translate for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to practice it in Pict,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve written the words to sound exactly like the Pict words here. On the other side, the English version and the correct Pict version.\u201d He smiles. \u201c\u2019Tis the only way.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Gawan puts a large hand on my shoulder and squeezes. \u201cYou\u2019re a brave lady, Riley Poe. And I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re the only one who can enter that plane and emerge intact. You be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. And thanks,\u201d I answer, and meet his gaze. \u201cNow say the prayer one more time. Pretty cool lingo, Pict.\u201d</p><p>Gawan smiles. \u201cSo says my wife.\u201d</p><p>I return the smile. \u201cI\u2019m sure she does.\u201d And then Gawan repeats the verse once more.</p><p>\u201cHere are your bags, sirs,\u201d Peter says from the front door. A duffel bag weighs down each hand. He makes his way to Tristan and sets them on the gravel.</p><p>\u201cThank you, good man,\u201d Tristan says, then looks at me. \u201cOnce all of this has been dealt with accordingly, you and your betrothed will have to drive down for a visit,\u201d he invites. \u201cWe\u2019ve an annual medieval tournament you won\u2019t want to miss.\u201d He walks over and takes my hand in his large ones. \u201c\u2019Tis been a pleasure, Ms. Poe. You take great care in your battles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will, and thanks for the lessons,\u201d I respond. \u201cWe\u2019ll kick some Fallen ass and head your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPosthaste,\u201d Jason adds. \u201cLady Andi would truly love to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason!\u201d Tristan says, already halfway to the Rover.</p><p>Jason grins, wiggles his brows, and again lowers his body to a bow and kisses my hand. \u201cUntil then,\u201d he says, then hastens away. \u201cComing, Sir Tristan!\u201d</p><p>Gawan grabs his duffle. \u201cGodspeed,\u201d he says, grasping my shoulder.</p><p>Damn, I can\u2019t help it. Just once more.</p><p>\u201cGawan, close your eyes for just a minute,\u201d Andi said. \u201cI\u2019ll wake you up when the doctor comes in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d said Tristan, \u201cyou can\u2019t just sit there, leaning on your knees with your head hanging down. You\u2019ll get a bloody crick in your neck.\u201d</p><p>With a hefty sigh, Gawan leaned back in the chair and scrubbed his stubbled jaw. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He glanced around.</p><p>The waiting lobby was full. Nearly every soul at both Grimm and Dreadmoor filled the place, not to mention the four Morgans. Some stood against the wall; some sat on the carpeted floor, backs to the wall.</p><p>Rick Morgan sat, much like he did, forearms resting on his knees, head bowed. Once, he\u2019d lifted his head and glanced at Gawan, and the worry etched into the man\u2019s face grew deeper by the second. He\u2019d given Gawan a slight nod and then had gone back to staring at the space between his feet.</p><p>Even Nicklesby, Gawan noticed, sat very still in a corner chair, simply staring. Jason sat with Ellie\u2019s sister; both were quiet. Everyone looked exhausted.</p><p>It had been a night from Hell.</p><p>After the medics had all but pried Ellie from Gawan\u2019s arms, they\u2019d rushed her to the medical infirmary. After quick X-rays and CT scans of her head and body, they\u2019d rushed her into emergency surgery. While her arms and legs had gained no injury and her head, surprisingly, hadn\u2019t suffered any, she had acquired multiple internal injuries that, had she not been found when she had, would have surely taken her life.</p><p>The constable had arrived and taken the woman at the farm and her drunken husband into custody. While the man had still been unconscious with drink, the woman confessed everything.</p><p>Her husband had struck Ellie with his truck that night Gawan had found her. Fearful of being sent to jail for drunk driving or, worse, vehicular homicide, he brought Ellie to his wife and forced her to take care of her. They\u2019d moved her back and forth from the farm to the kirk, afraid of their secret being found out. Ellie could not have lasted on her own without food, water, warmth. So for that, he was eternally grateful to the woman.</p><p>Still, they had no idea why Ellie had been on Grimm\u2019s lane. That the man had nearly run Gawan off the road while carrying an unconscious Ellie in the back of his truck made his stomach ache.</p><p>And now, she fought for her very life.</p><p>They\u2019d been directed to the intensive-care waiting lobby until her surgery was completed. Which, thought Gawan, is bloody taking forever. They\u2019d taken her at close to five the evening before, and now it was nearly four in the morning.</p><p>For the hundredth time, he rose and began to pace. Shoving a hand through his knotted hair, he rubbed his eyes and walked to the window. In twenty hours, he would have become a mortal again. And while he knew he wouldn\u2019t remember later, he wanted to know now that she\u2019d be well and healthy. It was making him daft, the waiting, and the click-click-click of the minute hand on the old, clunky wall clock echoed so loudly in the lobby, he forced himself not to yank it from the wall and bust it.</p><p>\u201cMr. Morgan?\u201d</p><p>Everyone stood up.</p><p>Rick Morgan crossed the floor, and as he passed Gawan, he inclined his head. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Appreciation swept over him, for the man certainly didn\u2019t have to allow Gawan to listen in on a personal family matter. Out in the hallway, the doctor waited. He looked weary, Gawan noted. And before Gawan could hop into his head, he spoke.</p><p>\u201cYour daughter is in critical condition, Mr. Morgan,\u201d he said, meeting Rick Morgan\u2019s eyes with a steady, forthright gaze through a pair of spectacles. \u201cI don\u2019t know how she bloody made it as long as she did. Her lung was punctured by a fractured rib, and her spleen had ruptured. And with the drastic shock she was in, well\u201d\u2014 he glanced at Gawan\u2014\u201cit\u2019s a miracle she made it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rick Morgan held his younger daughter close. \u201cIs she going to continue to make it?\u201d</p><p>The doctor placed a hand on Rick Morgan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThis is a critical time for her, I\u2019m afraid. She\u2019s young and, prior to this, healthy, so her chances are good. She\u2019s stable right now. But given what she\u2019s been through . . .\u201d He squeezed his shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>Once the physician left, a nurse dressed in blue trousers and tunic walked up and smiled. \u201cAre you the Morgan family?\u201d</p> <p>Rick Morgan nodded.</p><p>\u201cTwo can come back,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cJust two?\u201d Ellie\u2019s brother, Kyle, said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. ICU regulations.\u201d She glanced around. \u201cWhich two? You can follow me.\u201d</p><p>Gawan locked eyes with her. Five can come in and stay at all times, even outside of visiting hours, if they wish. Let your coworkers know the physician says it\u2019s all right.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, eyes wide. \u201cYou can all follow me.\u201d</p><p>Rick Morgan looked at Gawan and then silently followed the wide-eyed nurse. As they passed the small nurse\u2019s station in the center of the ward, Gawan willed them each to let them all stay on in Ellie\u2019s room, just for good measure.</p><p>Gawan was in no way prepared to see his intended the way he now saw her: tubes, beeping machines, her face pale, and a ventilator doing Ellie\u2019s breathing for her. Aye, he knew the names of such machines, and he hated seeing them strapped to her.</p><p>Ellie\u2019s sister cried and held her hand.</p><p>Her brothers, flanking Ellie\u2019s sides, just stood there, silent, their hands resting on the covers beside her.</p><p>Rick Morgan\u2019s face had blanched, and as big as the man was, Gawan noticed the trembling in his hands as he swiped back a bit of Ellie\u2019s hair. \u201cChrist, girl,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cChrist.\u201d</p> <p>Gawan stood back near the foot of the bed and watched Ellie\u2019s chest rise and fall with each horrible click of that machine. He watched for as long as he could stand it before he simply closed his eyes.</p><p>And so it went on like that, all day long. The Morgan siblings went in and out, graciously allowing others to replace them. Only Rick Morgan and Gawan remained constantly. The Dreadmoor knights, they took their turns coming to see Ellie, but none of them stayed long. Only Jason, who, by the bloody saints, looked as pale as Ellie, lingered a while, whispered something in her ear, and then left.</p><p>Hours passed by, and Gawan never sat. He could do nothing save stand beside Ellie, hold her hand, and pray she\u2019d make it. Once, when Rick Morgan stepped into the garderobe and no one else was about, Gawan whispered into Ellie\u2019s ear, \u201cI mewn hon buchedd a I mewn I \u2019r \u2019n gyfnesaf, Adduneda \u2019m cara atat forever \u2019n ddarpar.\u201d It was a heartfelt verse in his native tongue, and he prayed that even though she was deep in slumber, she may hear it. He supposed he\u2019d never know.</p><p>It was hours later when Nicklesby touched his arm. \u201cSir, are you aware of the time?\u201d</p><p>Gawan glanced at the clock. Nearly six p.m. \u201cNay, not until just now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve only a few more hours remaining,\u201d he said, his voice quiet. \u201cI know this is passing sorrowful, Sir Gawan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what needs to be done, my friend,\u201d Gawan said, grasping Nicklesby\u2019s bony shoulder and giving a thankful squeeze. \u201cNot yet, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor lamb,\u201d he said, casting a glance at Ellie. \u201cI\u2019ll be just outside, if you need me.\u201d Then he left.</p> <p>By the next hour, everything changed drastically.</p><p>He, Rick Morgan, Andi, and Tristan were in Ellie\u2019s room when her body jerked. That blasted intubator began to sound its alarm, and within the next second the monitor indicating her heartbeat let out a long, solid scream. Gawan knew well and good what that meant. He and Rick Morgan yelled \u201cNurse!\u201d at the same time.</p><p>The nurse ran in, took one look at Ellie, pushed past Gawan, and slammed her fist against a round silver button on the wall, sending off an alarm overhead.</p><p>A code was called.</p><p>He was losing Ellie.</p><p>The curtain to Ellie\u2019s room was yanked, and in a matter of seconds was filled with all sorts of hospital staff, squeezing past one another to get to her. A doctor\u2014not the one who performed the surgery\u2014ran in and yelled, \u201cSomeone get these people out of here!\u201d</p><p>And then what his Ellie would have termed A Fiasco ensued. Again.</p><p>Because, by the bloody saints above, Gawan wasn\u2019t going anywhere.</p><p>While he didn\u2019t want to interfere with Ellie\u2019s care, Gawan knew he could not leave. Not for one bloody second. He willed the doctor and other staff to ignore everyone else and simply do their jobs, which they did.</p><p>Meanwhile, everyone from the waiting lobby poured out to wait by Ellie\u2019s room. Even the Grimm ghosts had shown up.</p><p>Gawan paced, glanced over shoulders, and swore. Everything was chaotic, Bailey was crying, Andi was crying, and the men were cursing in various languages.</p><p>Gawan lurked in the physician\u2019s mind.</p><p>She\u2019s gone.</p><p>\u201cNay!\u201d Gawan yelled at the doctor. \u201cStay your course. Do you hear? Keep to your bloody task!\u201d Fury rolled inside him like a great North Sea wave, his insides burned with it, and as he watched the lifeless body of his beloved laying there, unresponsive, Gawan let out a battle cry he\u2019d not released in centuries.</p><p>And as all eyes turned to him, everything, everyone in Ellie\u2019s room grew completely silent. No beeping machines, no curses, no commands from the doctor, no weeping. Silence.</p><p>With his eyes locked on Ellie\u2019s face, he released something else. An ancient Welsh verse. Rather, a plea. A barter.</p><p>His life force for Ellie\u2019s.</p><p>And just that fast, without hesitation, it was done.</p><p>A white light boomed into the room, and, silently, everyone squinted against its brightness. The stillness was deafening.</p><p>Like a bolt of lightning, the memories Gawan had shared with Ellie of Aquitaine flashed through his mind at top speed, yet he saw each one with perfect clarity. And just at that last second, that last breath of a heartbeat, just before Gawan of Conwyk vanished into thin air in front of the entire ICU, Ellie opened her eyes and their gazes locked.</p><p>And then Gawan disappeared.</p><p>I blink, and the whole scene washes away, and I\u2019m eye to eye with Gawan of Conwyk, back in the Crescent\u2019s courtyard. I cock my head at the ancient Pict warrior.</p><p>\u201cYou gave your life force to save Ellie\u2019s,\u201d I say. \u201cImpressive.\u201d</p><p>Gawan merely smiles at me, those chocolate brown eyes turning liquid in the courtyard\u2019s lamplight. \u201cI had no choice.\u201d</p><p>We both share a smile, and Gawan nods at Eli and strides across the courtyard to the Rover. I know now that I want to know lots more about Dreadmoor and Grimm. Hopefully, I\u2019ll get the chance.</p><p>With the team behind me, we watch the two big warriors, along with a somewhat smaller warrior, climb into the Rover and pull out of the wynd.</p><p>\u201cNice to see chivalry isn\u2019t dead after all,\u201d Ginger says beside me.</p><p>Eli\u2019s arm snakes around my waist, and I lean against him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answer. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>As we all stand there in the light of the Crescent, me clutching my new scathe, I glance around at the souls who will have my back and whose back I\u2019ll have. I don\u2019t really know them, yet I fully and wholeheartedly trust them. I know that the hell about to break loose in Edinburgh within the next few hours will be unimaginable.</p><p>I know we\u2019ll all fight together to end it.</p><p>The one thing that bothers me, though, and it\u2019s something I just can\u2019t seem to shake. I hate it. I wish like hell the thought didn\u2019t exist, but it does.</p><p>One of us won\u2019t make it out alive.</p><p>Despite my DNA, I\u2019m still the most vulnerable. It may very well be me.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to hear you think that again. Ever. This from Victorian. Moving my gaze to his, I stare. The furrowed dark brows, the narrowed eyes, and pursed lips all express fierce anger. Even a little fear. Nothing will happen to you. Do you understand me?</p><p>I give a slight grin. Whoa, step back, my crazy Romanian bodyguard. I\u2019m just being realistic. Keeps me on my toes. I frown. And get out of my head. You promised.</p><p>To my surprise, instead of a smart-ass remark, or, more Vic\u2019s speed, a dirty remark, he stares. Scowls. Then turns away.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>I mentally shake my head and sigh. Without thinking, I scan the Crescent, up the aged stone of the former school until my vision rests on a window. My window.</p><p>The little white-faced girl stares back at me.</p><p>Although my initial reaction is anxiety, it\u2019s over in an instant. I\u2019m not scared of her. I don\u2019t know why, but I\u2019m not. Something about her intrigues me, and I have a strong feeling she\u2019s probably the same creepy kid who scared the life out of that professor so long ago. I wonder what she wants. I have to remember to ask Gabriel about her later. There has to be a reason why she is seeking me out over all the others.</p><p>I hold her gaze for a moment more. I think we might be having a staring contest, and since I\u2019ve had several with not only my baby brother but also with my dog, Chaz, and won them all, I\u2019ll see how I hold up with a naughty, creepy Victorian kid spirit.</p><p>Several moments later, she disappears.</p><p>Riley, one. Creepy little dead girl, zip.</p><p>The creaking of the Crescent\u2019s gates draws my attention, and I notice they\u2019re closing. Peter is hurrying to a side door and quickly disappears inside. As a group, the WUP team begins to move toward the front entrance. I glance up at the dark sky. Clouds shift, stretching across the half-moon, and a few stars shine through. A coldness drifts across the courtyard and whisks in through the doorway behind us.</p><p>And with it, that thing I\u2019m starting to recognize more clearly. It\u2019s actually becoming a nuisance.</p><p>Dread.</p><p>And that\u2019s when I hear it. Softly, at first\u2014so barely there I almost think I imagined it. Then I hear it again. It sounds like it\u2019s coming from the street. By Bene\u2019s, maybe? Close. It\u2019s a kid\u2019s voice. A boy. Teenager. He\u2019s whimpering. Without a thought, I stand, listening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRi, you coming?\u201d Eli says from the doorway.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just a minute,\u201d I answer. I glance at him. \u201cI\u2019ll be right in.\u201d</p><p>Eli stares at me for a moment, then cocks his head. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p> <p>I smile. \u201cYep,\u201d I answer. \u201cJust gathering my thoughts. I\u2019m coming.\u201d</p><p>More stares, then a nod. He follows the others inside and closes the door. Eli learned a long time ago to allow me space. This is one of those times I need it.</p><p>I hear the whimper again, and I turn my gaze toward the gates. I focus on the boy\u2019s voice, and everything silences but him. The gates are crystal clear, and I head straight to them. In one leap, I\u2019m over the wrought iron and am hurrying along the cobbles to the street. The boy\u2019s voice, his whimpers, is closer. Clearer. I turn left and jog up the sidewalk. Another set of gates come into view, and, glancing around, I leap those, too. It\u2019s a church. The whimpers are coming from behind it. I hug the wall, easing around the old stone building. A cemetery stretches out behind the church, and across the graveyard I feel it. Another presence. With the boy. No heartbeat, though. Not a good sign. At least I hear the boy\u2019s heart. Fast, but strong.</p><p>Hurrying across the graveyard, I slip over the ground soundlessly. I see shadows coming from a hollowed-out tomb. Peeking inside, I find the boy crouching in the corner. Alone. His eyes widen when he sees me, and I press my finger to my lips, shushing him. The boy shakes his head, and his eyes dart behind me. I glance. Almost too late.</p><p>I leap high, bounding off the wall of the tomb, and land in a crouch several feet away. Before me, bathed in moonlight, an otherbeing. I\u2019m guessing a vampire. Tall. Wearing dark jeans. Black T-shirt. Black jacket. Gray skully. Maybe midtwenties. At least, that\u2019s how old he looks.</p> <p>\u201cPlus a few hundred years, darlin\u2019,\u201d he says in a heavy brogue. \u201cYou\u2019re a nice surprise.\u201d</p><p>I glance at the boy, still crouched in the corner of the tomb. \u201cRun, kid. Get out of here. Now.\u201d</p><p>The boy doesn\u2019t move. He\u2019s quivering in his shoes. And from the smell of it, he\u2019s peed his pants. I use a stronger suggestion. \u201cGet outta here, kid. Now. Go home to your family. Stay off the streets.\u201d</p><p>This time, the kid scrambles out of the tomb and hauls ass out of the cemetery. When I turn back to the guy, he\u2019s right in front of me.</p><p>His face suddenly blurs, shifts form, and his fangs drop. Not just two incisors. All of them. Jagged, sharp fangs that look like they can bite a head off.</p><p>He grabs for me, but I duck, leaping out of his grasp and rolling across the stone and rock. I jump to my feet and he\u2019s staring at me. His eyes are opaque. And before I can blink, he\u2019s got me by the throat. My toes leave the ground.</p> <p>\u201cThink you can escape me, little human bitch?\u201d he says smoothly. He slams me on the ground, then pushes his foot into my chest. \u201cYou cannot.\u201d Dropping to one knee, he draws close to me. \u201cThis will be . . . interesting.\u201d Lightning fast, he kicks my jaw. My head snaps to the side. He\u2019s damn fast. And he\u2019s grinning at me. Pissing me the fuck off.</p><p>My hand slips to my waist, and I pull out my blade. Pressing the tip to his spine, I smile. \u201cYeah. It will\u2014\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s suddenly off of me, his body slamming into the trunk of an old tree. Eli is completely morphed. \u201cBabe, your blade?\u201d</p><p>I leap to my feet, aim my blade at the newcomer, and throw. Hard. It buries to the hilt. Eli backs up, just as the body begins shuddering. The vamp drops to the ground. Dead.</p><p>Walking over, I kick my blade out of the vampire pile and pick it up. I wipe the blade on my pants and glance at Eli. \u201cHe was about to kill a kid. I heard him whimpering from the Crescent.\u201d</p><p>Eli drapes an arm over my shoulder and we quit the cemetery. \u201cI\u2019m guessing he got away?\u201d</p><p>I lean into him. \u201cYeah. He was scared shitless. But he finally ran.\u201d We\u2019re under a streetlight, and I look up into Eli\u2019s face. \u201cI had him.\u201d</p><p>Eli chuckles. \u201cI know you did. I might give you space, darlin\u2019, but if you think I\u2019m going to just let you run off into the city to fight bad guys alone\u201d\u2014he kisses me on the nose\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p> <p>Much later, we\u2019re all in the study, going over maps of Old Town. In front of Eli and me, an intricate layout of the vaults. An entire network\u2014no, an entire town\u2014once existed beneath Edinburgh.</p><p>\u201cWith poor or virtually no ventilation and at times inhuman living conditions, many inhabitants died there,\u201d Jake says. \u201cCandlemakers, whiskey merchants, shoe cobblers; they all had businesses below the city. As I said before, the plague wiped out most of them, and the vaults were left untouched for centuries. Superstitious lot, the Scots, and for good reason.\u201d He grins. \u201cAll those cold wisps of air and hair-raising spectral shoves are, in fact, real.\u201d</p><p>I just stare at him.</p><p>\u201cThere are any numbers of places to hide down there,\u201d Darius adds. \u201cBut we\u2019ve a suspicion, based on what we know about these particular Fallen, that they use the vaults strictly as a place of torture,\u201d he says, his face solemn. \u201cFor their victims.\u201d</p><p>I shudder at the thought. \u201cSo where will we find them?\u201d I ask. \u201cAnd how do we keep them from knowing who and what we are?\u201d Although one, I believe, already knows me.</p><p>\u201cOnce you\u2019re spotted the first time, that\u2019s it,\u201d Jake says. \u201cThey already know of Gabriel, me, and Ms. Maspeth,\u201d he says, inclining his head toward Sydney, who still pores over the old Celtae tomes. \u201cYour element of surprise won\u2019t last long.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cUse it wisely. As for us,\u201d he continues, \u201cGabriel has charmed this place. They can\u2019t reach beyond our gates.\u201d</p><p>Well that\u2019s a relief.</p><p>\u201cTheir tastes run exquisitely high,\u201d Darius adds. \u201cAnd in their search for the relics they seek out high-priced antique auctions, among other gatherings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharity balls, for example,\u201d Gabriel says. He looks at me. \u201cFor the women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you are part of the brethren who killed the Celtae in the first place,\u201d asks Ginger, looking up from her map of Old Town, \u201chow is it you can\u2019t read those tomes?\u201d</p><p>Darius sighs and shoves his hand through his hair. \u201cBecause despite our daring overtaking of the Celtae, they were wily,\u201d he says. \u201cThey used the curse of illiteracy against all of us.\u201d He looks at Sydney. \u201cThe only way I could counteract it was to target Ms. Maspeth\u2019s fate as the Archivist.\u201d His gaze moves back to me. \u201cShe unwillingly sacrificed her entire life to become one of us. Left her home, her family, her job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d Sydney says without looking up. \u201cThis is what I do now.\u201d</p><p>Darius nods. \u201cWe\u2019ve all sacrificed. Without it, mankind would be in peril.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean \u2018serious shit,\u2019\u201d Noah says, looking up from his own map of the city. He scratches his ear. \u201cI\u2019m restless,\u201d he says, stands and stretches, and crosses the floor to stand next to where I sit. \u201cI need to go for a run.\u201d He thumps my head and looks at me. \u201cRi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I say, and look at Eli. I crack my knuckles. \u201cHow \u2019bout you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need Miles to stay,\u201d Jake says. \u201cGabriel and I have a few things to go over with him.\u201d</p><p>I stand and pat Noah on the head. \u201cSorry, old boy,\u201d I grin. \u201cMaybe next time.\u201d</p><p>Noah growls under his breath.</p><p>I look over at the lupines. \u201cHow \u2019bout you guys?\u201d Then at Victorian. \u201cVic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPass,\u201d they all say at once.</p><p>I shrug. \u201cSuit yourselves.\u201d I grin at Eli. \u201cRace you to the monument?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWinner gets ice cream,\u201d he says. \u201cVittoria\u2019s.\u201d A grin stretches his face. \u201cFound it earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d I glance at my clunky boots. \u201cI gotta change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Eli says.</p><p>We both head up the stairs and are ready in two minutes. I pull on what I wore to train in, except I secure my silver dirk beneath the waistline of my Lycra pants. I pull on black Nikes and braid my hair into a long tail on the way down the steps. Just before we come into view of the hall, Eli pulls me to a stop. His body crowds mine, and I lean against the wall. With a knuckle he tilts my head upward to meet his stare. He says nothing, just . . . stares. Then he lowers his head and brushes his lips over mine. A shot of fire stings my veins as Eli\u2019s tongue caresses mine and his hand slips behind my neck and holds my head in just the right position. He kisses me slowly, with intent. When he pulls back, I\u2019m breathless.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Riley Poe,\u201d he whispers, and brushes a finger over my cheek. \u201cMy soon-to-be wife.\u201d</p><p>I smile at him, slip my arms around his waist, and fall into his embrace. \u201cI love you, Eligius Dupr\u00e9.\u201d I grab his ass and squeeze, and he laughs into my hair. \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m literally going to throw up this time.\u201d</p><p>With a start, I turn. Noah stands at the bottom of the steps, his arms crossed over his chest. That crazy mass of dreads is pulled back into some sort of a ponytail. Contained anyway. \u201cJealous?\u201d I ask, and bat my eyes.</p><p>Noah\u2019s mercury eyes shine. \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d He looks at Eli. \u201cLucky fu\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suggest you take a left out of the gates to Parliament, then cross over to Carlton, then to Waterloo, past Waverly Station,\u201d Jake interrupts Noah\u2019s swear. \u201cAnd stay to the shadows if possible. Too much gossip about a pair of crazed free runners may cause unwanted attention.\u201d</p><p>Eli gives him a nod, then looks down at me. Wordlessly, he inclines his head toward the door. \u201cWe are masters at hiding our free-running talents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Jake states. \u201cMake sure it stays that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna go, Andorra?\u201d I ask, smiling. \u201cTest your skills against a little ole human with tendencies?\u201d</p><p>Jake grins. \u201cAnother time, Poe.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I feel not only Noah\u2019s eyes on me as I leave, but Victorian\u2019s, as well. Worrywarts. Neither will ever get used to the idea that I can handle myself. Eli worries, too, but he\u2019s learned to keep most of it to himself. Besides, I\u2019m with a vicious vampire. When provoked, he\u2019s as rabid as a sick badger on crack.</p><p>\u201cFlattery will get you nowhere,\u201d Eli says outside.</p><p>I give him a smile. \u201cYou know what will?\u201d I say.</p> <p>Eli cocks his head and grins. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>I sink my elbow in his ribs. \u201cThat!\u201d</p><p>I take off.</p><p>Eli takes off after me. Swearing. In French.</p><p>\u201cShall I open the gates, lass?\u201d Peter calls from behind me.</p> <p>\u201cNo, thanks!\u201d I reply, and take one leap to clear the tall, wrought-iron monsters. Landing in a crouch in the shadows, Eli drops right beside me. He glances at me and grins, and we both turn left at a normal run. A mortal run. A few people are still on the streets\u2014late-night revelers, college kids.</p><p>We make it almost to Parliament, where it\u2019s darker, and turn left onto Carlton. Not much activity, so we pick up the pace. I look over at him. \u201cTo the top of the monument,\u201d I clarify. \u201cThe pointy part.\u201d</p><p>Eli simply grins.</p><p>Its two thirty a.m., and even the black cabs have thinned out. Much of Edinburgh is quiet, including Vittoria\u2019s, which means no ice cream tonight. For the most part, though, this street is safe. Staying close to the stone buildings, the shadows, we free run. Bounding off walls, garden gates, and tree trunks, we move swiftly, silently, at speeds a mortal can\u2019t possibly conceive. I can barely conceive it. I\u2019m pretty positive that even if we do pass a mortal, their eyes couldn\u2019t follow our movements. Not enough to actually see what they think they saw.</p><p>Eli has trouble keeping up with me, and I fight not to laugh out loud. My body feels good, healthy, strong, and I stretch the strides a bit more. My skin and the Lycra feel one and the same. Wind must be moving through my lungs, because I am a mortal, after all, yet I\u2019m not winded. Not one bit. It\u2019s as though I\u2019m standing still, unmoving. Or flying.</p><p>We hit Waterloo Place and really open up. In the heart of the city there are plenty of shadowy places to hide, and we take advantage of them. I\u2019m ahead of Eli now, and I\u2019m determined to reach the top of that damn monument before he does.</p> <p>Waverly Station comes into view and I head toward it. Pass it. Hit Princes Street and slow down long enough to find shadows again, then turn up the speed. The monument is, like, right there\u2014tall, spindly, and stabbing the sky\u2014and after a few leaps onto the aged stone spires, I\u2019m climbing. Hand over hand. Faster. Jagged stone scrapes my palms as I ascend, closer to the top of the spire.</p><p>I grab the point and brace myself against the wind whipping me. At this height, I can see the whole city. Exhilaration fills me, and I want to shout but I don\u2019t. Instead I look down, readying myself to have my ankle yanked by Eli.</p><p>Eli isn\u2019t here.</p><p>My eyes scan the spire and farther down the monument. The street below me is empty. I don\u2019t see him anywhere. Shit! Eligius Dupr\u00e9, where the hell are you?</p><p>For a second, no answer. My heart skips, and I descend the monument. From twenty feet I drop to the ground and stay in the shadows of the aged arched stone, waiting. Adrenaline fills me\u2014a condition that has begun since my heart now beats so slowly. A frantic feeling is slipping inside of me, and I call again.</p><p>Eli, goddamn it! You better answer me. Swear to God, this isn\u2019t funny!</p><p>No answer. My eyes scan Princes Street and back toward Waverly Station. The more I see nothing and the more Eli doesn\u2019t answer me inside my head, the more frantic I become. It\u2019s not like him to be silent. Especially when it comes to me. And especially when he knows we\u2019re facing unknown shit in Edinburgh. I begin to move through the streets. Closer to the train station.</p><p>It\u2019s not quite three a.m., and Waverly\u2019s insides are dark and closed up. The station itself is huge, and I\u2019ve already watched a security car go by twice. I\u2019m in the shadows, and no way do they see me. Something is drawing me here, and I can\u2019t identify it other than gut feeling.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not a good one.</p><p>Eli, if you\u2019re fucking with me, I will not forgive you. Swear to God I mean it.</p><p>No way. No freaking way is he screwing with me. Something\u2019s up and I know it. My insides feel icy with fear. This is completely out of Eli\u2019s character.</p><p>I stop a second, lean my back against the stone wall, and think. Concentrate. Get your head together, Poe.</p><p>Listen.</p><p>Inhale.</p><p>I smell it first. It\u2019s coming from inside the station. And that\u2019s where I\u2019ll be in five seconds.</p><p>Slipping into a place as big as Waverly Station in the heart of Edinburgh isn\u2019t easy. Looking over, I see the reddish stone main building of Waverly rising skyward, complete with its clock tower. I make my way closer. I get to the closed and locked outer gate of one of the station\u2019s car entrances, leap over that gate easily enough, and jog down the paved ramp and through the underground tunnel. It\u2019s dark, with only a few lamps casting a little light ahead of me. The main entrance is locked. Too bad metal doesn\u2019t work the same way a soul\u2019s mind does, or I\u2019d force it open. Instead I place my palms against the steel, press my weight against my arms, and push. Hard.</p><p>Hard enough to bend the steel hinges. I push until it gives\u2014a large-enough gap for me to squeeze through. Inside the station, it\u2019s dimly lit and vacant. Store merchants are closed down, roll cages in place, lights off. The big arrival/departure board is black. The stench is nauseating. The silence is nearly deafening. At least until I tune in.</p><p>A voice\u2014in a language I\u2019m completely unfamiliar with\u2014vibrates in my ears. Rather, in my mind. It barely sounds human. So what the hell is it? There are no human words, not in this station anyway. I fine-tune my hearing by concentrating on my immediate surroundings, so the sounds from a mile away, up the street, in people\u2019s homes, the pubs, the police department, don\u2019t filter in. I turn my head. It\u2019s coming from . . . closer to the tracks. Hugging the wall, I ease silently on the rubber soles of my shoes, through the shadows. As I near a sign that says PLATFORM 11, I slip over the bar, and move closer. The incoming track is empty; a vacant train waits on the other track, lights off. When I look left, toward the exit, the tracks disappear into the darkness.</p><p>That\u2019s when I see them. At the end of the platform, where concrete meets tunnel wall and eventually, blackness.</p><p>They\u2019re with Eli. But it\u2019s not what I expect.</p><p>My heart drops.</p><p>There\u2019re seven of them. Punks. As far as I can tell, just mortal older teenagers. Maybe even a gang. Why the hell aren\u2019t they saying anything? And what\u2019s that stench?</p><p>They speak.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll leave here wi\u2019 us, freak,\u201d says one to Eli. The guy\u2019s tall with short-clipped dark hair and multiple piercings, and dressed in dark jeans frayed at the bottoms and a dark wool coat. \u201cDunna know how you got here, but you ain\u2019t stayin\u2019.\u201d He shoves Eli square in the chest. Eli stumbles backward. \u201cYa ken, freak?\u201d</p><p>Ken? What is that? Edinburgh slang? I don\u2019t understand most of it, but the meaning is there and universal. He wants to kick Eli\u2019s ass. And Eli must be dragging every ounce of strength he has not to drop fang and rip the kid\u2019s head off. Eli, move away from them. Do it now. I wait after the suggestion, but Eli doesn\u2019t budge. Why isn\u2019t it working on him?</p><p>The kid says something to the others, who\u2019ve remained silent, over his shoulder. Again a language that I can\u2019t understand. I can\u2019t even mimic it. It\u2019s that odd.</p><p>There\u2019s a body on the ground at Eli\u2019s feet, unmoving. I tune in past their voices and listen. The faint whisper of ragged breath slowly escapes that body. The thready thump of a pulse. A slight groan. Beaten, maybe? Hopefully, that\u2019s all. Had Eli tried to help the kid on the ground?</p><p>I remain in the shadows, observing, but that\u2019s not what I want to be doing. I want to charge them, fight, and shake Eli until he snaps out of his wordless daze. Eli, why don\u2019t you answer me? What in Hell is happening?</p><p>Eli ignores me. He doesn\u2019t look at me. Doesn\u2019t answer me. Doesn\u2019t even flinch at my silent call. That scares the hell out of me.</p><p>The stench is overwhelming, yet I can\u2019t determine where it\u2019s coming from. I don\u2019t sense that the boys are Jod\u00eds; something about them is all wrong for that. But they\u2019re something.</p><p>I\u2019ve had enough. My body hums with adrenaline, fear, and fury. Power collects in my muscles, my joints, bones, and just before I lunge out of the shadows, I hear it. Overhead. The sound of a hundred wings beating. The wind picks up on the platform and pushes me against the wall. I fight it, push back. My eyes find Eli and I call out. Again he doesn\u2019t move, just stands there, looking dead at the kid in front of him. Doesn\u2019t even acknowledge me or the beating wings and wind. Then it happens. So fast, I can\u2019t process it until it\u2019s over. My body freezes. I can\u2019t move.</p><p>Eli remains motionless.</p><p>I concentrate on the punks. Move away. All of you. To the far wall, across the station.</p><p>Every one of the guys back up. Swearing and looking around, they continue to back up.</p><p>Eli still doesn\u2019t move.</p><p>In the next second, three men emerge from above. Sweep down. They surround the pack of kids, push them forward. Again that noise, that speech that makes no sense, fills my head, and it\u2019s coming from the three. Shadows flicker and keep in sync with the deafening sound of beating wings overhead. I can barely see Eli now, only in quick flashes of light. But I see enough. Hear enough.</p><p>In the distance, the screech of metal against metal. Train wheels on tracks. My eyes dart to the tunnel and I see a light advancing.</p><p>Eli, run! Turn around and run. Toward me. Eli\u2019s legs, move!</p><p>Nothing happens. Eli stands there as though in a weird trance.</p><p>Then two of the three men move so fast my vision can\u2019t keep up. In patches of flashing light and shadow, like I\u2019m in some freaky disco club, one by one the boys are flung across the platform to the opposite wall. Their screams fill the tunnel, echo and sink into my insides. The crack of human skulls hitting concrete walls sickens me; their bones fracture loud enough for me to hear them splinter beneath their clothing. Blood is everywhere. The walls. The floor. They\u2019re all dead. Dead humans. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Just that fast, Eli changes. His jaw extends, fangs drop, and his body quivers with silent fury.</p><p>But he still doesn\u2019t move.</p><p>Soon, silence. The one who stands closest to Eli bends over and picks up the boy lying crumpled on the ground. He holds him effortlessly, suspended in midair, by the back of his neck. Only then do I recognize the boy as Ian, the one I\u2019d saved from the alternative St. Giles\u2019. He is limp, head hanging, arms and legs like sacks of boneless gel. I also recognize the man.</p> <p>He\u2019s the cloaked and hooded Fallen from my dream. The one I watched burn that human.</p><p>Then the other two turn to Eli. They\u2019re speaking in that fucked-up language directly to Eli, and acting as though his vampiric state isn\u2019t very impressive. Eli just stares at them, unblinking. Quivering, like his body is fueling. Eli! Snap out of it, goddamn it! I yell silently to him, but he still ignores me.</p><p>The one holding Ian turns his head in my direction. The flashes of light and shadow are so rapid that I can\u2019t get a good visual on his features, but it\u2019s definitely the same one from my dream. He\u2019s as tall as Eli. Solid. Older.</p><p>I stare at him. Pain, take over his body. Nerves, seize. Tendons, cinch up. Unmoving. Completely still.</p><p>A chilling smile stretches across his face, and he cracks his neck and looks me square in the eye. My power of suggestion doesn\u2019t work on Fallen. Jake was wrong after all.</p> <p>A presence approaches. I whip around, my heart leaping from my chest, but relief drowns me. Noah stands beside me in the shadows. His face is drawn tight; his mercury eyes, illuminated by the flashing lights, are filled with fury. They lock on to the scene before us. His hand reaches for mine, squeezes, and drops.</p><p>Then everything happens at once. So fast.</p><p>So fucking fast.</p><p>A train approaches the tunnel, and it\u2019s not slowing down. The screech of steel on steel all but deafens me, but that train isn\u2019t braking. It\u2019s flying into the tunnel, heading straight for PLATFORM 11. Then, in the midst of that blinding flash of light and shadow, the one holding Ian also grabs at Eli.</p><p>Just as the train approaches.</p><p>Just as the other two speak. One Fallen points at the tracks. Eli stands perfectly still. Frozen in place.</p> <p>I scream and lunge, and Noah grabs me. Pushes me behind him and lurches forward. I grab him. Hold fast. He allows it.</p><p>The Fallen throws himself at Eli, and they both fly in front of the train.</p><p>The vociferous sound of the train squalling through the station drowns out my anguished cry. All air leaves my body. I\u2019m numb, in shock. Sick to my stomach. The wings are still beating furiously overhead, but their sound no longer rises above the screeching train. I try to move, try to speak, but nothing comes out of me. I barely feel Noah\u2019s arms around me, keeping me upright. My larynx is paralyzed. Breath sticks to the lining of my lungs. I\u2019m frozen in place against the wall in the shadows.</p><p>Eli! Eli, please! Answer me!</p><p>Then, all at once, the train passes through and the wings cease, as does the incessant flashing light and shadow. Everything around me is a dull gray. The train disappears into the darkness, and I free myself from the choking fear, push out of Noah\u2019s arms, and stumble to the platform\u2019s edge. Eligius! Please!</p><p>Nothing. I hear nothing. I see nothing. No remnants of their bodies, no . . . nothing.</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>My eyes scan the tracks. My mind screams for him.</p> <p>Only silence. Only shadows.</p><p>Only Noah and I are left on the platform. The others have disappeared. Noah looks at me, kisses my forehead, and takes off up the tracks. He\u2019s moving so fast, I lose sight of him in the next blink.</p><p>I leap down off Platform 11 and onto the tracks. I begin to run, forgetting momentarily that behind me, on the platform, stands a . . . being. I don\u2019t care.</p><p>I don\u2019t fucking care.</p><p>As I run, I scream for Eli in my head. My feet move swiftly over the tracks, and once outside the tunnel I follow them far, to Edinburgh\u2019s city limit. I don\u2019t know how far I go or how long it takes me. Suddenly, though, I slow, then stop. I\u2019m standing on a lone track, and behind me, way behind me, is the tall clock tower of Waverly Station.</p><p>I feel a chill inside of me, something too close, in my space, and I whip around.</p><p>The one who\u2019d been holding Ian stands there. No more than two feet away.</p><p>He\u2019s alone. A Fallen. Tall. Too shadowy to see features. Even two feet away, he crowds me. Fear escapes me. Fury replaces it.</p><p>\u201cTell me where he is,\u201d I demand. He knows I speak of Eli. No need to explain.</p><p>In the darkness, he cocks his head. Studies me. Remains silent.</p><p>I find it hard to turn away.</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d I scream to the top of my lungs. That voice doesn\u2019t even belong to me. It belongs to someone who has lost her mind. Fury brews just below my skin\u2019s surface. I feel like I\u2019m going to combust at any second.</p><p>Wordlessly, he extends an arm, fist closed, facing down.</p><p>Hesitantly, I hold out my hand.</p><p>When his fist opens, a medallion falls into my palm.</p><p>Eli\u2019s medallion. His family crest. I know it before I even look at it. I can feel the particular ridges in the pattern. My heart sinks to the bottom of my soles. I know what it means. I know what it\u2019s supposed to mean. I can feel it.</p><p>But I refuse to acknowledge it. I fucking refuse.</p><p>I lift my gaze to stare at this demented asshole angel . . . whatever and whoever he is. After a moment more, he turns and walks away.</p><p>I blink. He\u2019s gone.</p><p>I mean, goddamn gone.</p><p>Jogging up the track a bit, I search the area. A mist rolls in from the Firth of Forth and creeps across the tracks. The air is boggy with the scent of sea life, so thick it\u2019s like soup. Gulls scream overhead. At least I think they\u2019re gulls.</p><p>There isn\u2019t the first sign of that guy. Of Eli. Or of the other two.</p><p>Did Eli just . . . I squeeze my eyes tightly shut, feel the strength go out of my legs. \u201cNo,\u201d I say, slipping to the ground. Rough gravel and stone bite through my Lycra and dig into my knees. \u201cNo . . .\u201d I can barely even say the word. It\u2019s like there\u2019s something stuck in my throat and I\u2019m unable to breathe. Unable to speak. Someone has their hands around my throat, choking me.</p><p>Noah is beside me now, crouching down, his eyes locked onto mine. Never have I seen his face so stern. \u201cRi,\u201d he says calmly. \u201cWe have to get out of here.\u201d With his hand he pushes my loose hair back, off my face and out of my eyes. \u201cNow, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>I stand, looking around. I scan the tracks. No way what just happened, happened.</p><p>No way. It just didn\u2019t.</p><p>Noah\u2019s hand grips my shoulder. \u201cNow, Riley\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go, Noah!\u201d I say angrily, and take a few steps up the tracks. I see nothing but grayness and mist. In the distance, a train rumbles. Steel against steel. A sound that now jabs my heart.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what we\u2019re up against,\u201d Noah says behind. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this alone. Not just the two of us. Maybe not all of us.\u201d</p><p>I turn and stare at him. Pissed. \u201cThe hell I don\u2019t, Noah.\u201d I glance in the direction of the train. \u201cIt\u2019s not real. It didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Again, air sticks in my lungs. \u201cThose kids.\u201d I turn and look at him. \u201cEli, Noah.\u201d I shake my head, dig my knuckles into my eye sockets. \u201cIt didn\u2019t fucking happen!\u201d As I\u2019m standing here, arguing with Noah, I feel my legs turning rubbery again. Swear to God, I don\u2019t think I can walk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll carry you outta here if I have to,\u201d Noah says. \u201cBut you\u2019re the strongest soul I know, Riley Poe.\u201d He tilts my head, knuckle to chin. Eyes filled with a mix of rage and pity stare at me, pleading. \u201cAnd we gotta get the hell outta here. Now.\u201d</p><p>I stare across the tracks at the tall gray buildings. The mist is even thicker now than before. The heavy scent of brine fills the air. If there\u2019s a horizon, I can\u2019t see it.</p><p>I\u2019m completely numb inside. I don\u2019t even know what to do. I just want to sink to the ground.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d Noah says, both hands on my shoulders. He squeezes. \u201cBut we have to get back to the Crescent.\u201d</p><p>Eli\u2019s medallion weighs heavy in my hand and I glance down at it. I\u2019d been gripping it so hard, its imprint rests in my palm. With a deep breath I nod and slip the medallion over my neck. I glance at Noah, nod again, and begin to run. It\u2019s still dark out, but the mist rolling in makes even the shadows hazy. It feels like a spray of fine water against my skin, and I inhale it into my lungs. The air is chilled, salty, and for a second it reminds me of Savannah. Of the salt marshes. Of home.</p><p>Only this place isn\u2019t home. Home is where Eli was, safe. Fearless. Top of the food chain. No predator could confront and win against a vampire. Impossible.</p><p>Yet I can\u2019t even say the words I know in my heart are true. I\u2019d watched it. Witnessed every move. I saw it happen. I know it happened.</p><p>Edinburgh houses a brand of evil I can\u2019t seem to grasp.</p><p>I just encountered it. I know it with all of my heart.</p><p>At Old Tolbooth Wynd, I swing through the arches, run up the narrow path, and leap over the Crescent\u2019s iron gates. Noah is right behind me.</p><p>Jake has to know something. Darius. Gabriel. One of them has to know what to do.</p><p>As I hurry up the steps, the weight of Eli\u2019s medallion burns into the skin of my chest.</p><p>The Black Fallen just fucked up.</p><p>I\u2019m going to make them wish they\u2019d never fallen from grace.</p><p>Or I\u2019ll die trying.</p><p>Part Seven</p><p>UNINVITED</p><p>Evil is like water, it abounds, is cheap, soon fouls, but runs itself clear of taint.</p><p>\u2014Samuel Butler, 1835\u20131902</p><p>The change in Riley now is like mist to black vapor. It is as obvious as a knife plunged into the heart. She won\u2019t accept her mate\u2019s fate. Will not. I can see it in her eyes. There\u2019s a fury there that is chilling. For the first time since arriving in Edinburgh, I feel like the Fallen have no chance in Hell of surviving. Not Riley Poe anyway.</p><p>\u2014Lucian MacLeod</p><p>\u201cRiley.\u201d</p><p>The moment I walk through the door, Victorian is there. Noah immediately steps in front of me, blocking the Romanian vampire from me. Noah says nothing. He simply stares at Vic, who only returns his hot glare for a second before turning his brown gaze to mine. What is it? Talk to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Noah\u2019s hand grips mine and leads me through the foyer to the library. Everyone is pretty much where we left them.</p><p>Where Eli and I left them.</p><p>I feel my knees go numb, my body begin to crumple.</p> <p>Noah grabs me, holds me up. Victorian, despite the glares and threats from Noah, is at my other side.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Jake says, striding toward us.</p><p>\u201cThe Fallen. They got Eli,\u201d Noah says. His voice is laced with fury. Eerily calm, barely contained fury.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018got him\u2019?\u201d Jake asks.</p><p>I look up and meet Jake\u2019s green gaze. The memory of what I saw rushes back, hits my gut like a brick. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be sick,\u201d I say, and pull from Noah\u2019s grasp. I bolt for . . . anywhere, stumbling, my hand over my mouth. I\u2019m lost, trying to find a bathroom, a trash can. Plant. Door. Anything.</p> <p>In my next breath I\u2019m swept up and Jake is running through the Crescent. I close my eyes because my head is now spinning. He eases me to the floor, kicks the toilet lid up with his foot, and holds my hair back. I wretch and wretch until I cough.</p><p>Coughing turns into sobbing. I break. I can\u2019t help it. I try not to but . . . it happens.</p><p>I totally break down. Even while it\u2019s happening, I know I\u2019m allowing myself this one weakness. This one snap. I\u2019ll let it all out, then be done. None of it will help bring Eli back.</p><p>At the sink, with Jake still holding my hair back, I throw water on my face and rinse out my mouth. He hands me a hand towel and I dry off, then our eyes lock in the mirror. Even Jake\u2019s face seems ashen.</p><p>\u201cIt canna be,\u201d he says, his unusual accent washing over me. Comforting me somewhat. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>With my hands propped against the sink, my head drops forward and the tears fall. Pain surges up from my insides, seizes my gut, my throat, and escapes on a noise even I can\u2019t define. Wailing cat. Singing whale.</p> <p>Mourning human with tendencies.</p><p>Uncontrolled sobs rack my body, my shoulders shake, and I feel myself sliding downward again. And once more Jake scoops me up and I allow it, just this once. Wrapping my arms around his neck, I bury my face into his chest and he rushes . . . somewhere. I don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t care. He\u2019s using more strength than he probably realizes to hold me close, because I\u2019m barely able to breathe. Again, don\u2019t care.</p><p>Jake lowers me onto a bed. As he sits beside me, his weight presses the mattress down and he pushes my hair from my face. I look up at him through hazy, teary eyes.</p><p>\u201cRest,\u201d Jake says. \u201cWe can talk later.\u201d</p><p>Inside, I\u2019m shaking. \u201cNo,\u201d I say, my voice quivering. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Jake studies me thoroughly, then nods. \u201cI already know what happened,\u201d he says gently. \u201cAfter Miles arrived. But I need to know what happened before that.\u201d</p><p>Need, he says. Not want, but need.</p><p>I draw a deep breath. \u201cWe were free running, racing to the monument. I got ahead of him,\u201d I say, and Eli\u2019s image flashes before my eyes. \u201cAnd just kept running. I was to the top of the monument before I even noticed Eli\u201d\u2014saying his name out loud physically hurts me\u2014\u201cwasn\u2019t with me.\u201d I stare at Jake. \u201cI called to him in my head, but he wouldn\u2019t answer.\u201d I close my eyes. \u201cHe never would not answer me, Jake.\u201d</p> <p>Jake is silent, his gaze remaining on mine, patiently waiting for me to continue.</p><p>\u201cHe always answers me, no matter what. I felt inside that something was wrong. Then I smelled it,\u201d I continue.</p><p>\u201cSmelled what?\u201d Jake asks.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cThat awful stench. It\u2019s hideous. It smelled like a Jod\u00eds.\u201d I look at him. \u201cI followed the smell to Waverly Station. When I got there, the station was closed up, but I could hear voices inside,\u201d I say. \u201cBut the language.\u201d I shake my head again and look at him. \u201cI can\u2019t even explain it, Jake. Nothing I\u2019ve ever heard before. It almost . . . hurt to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Jake\u2019s angry gaze locks with mine. \u201cThat\u2019s the language of an angel. No one can understand it or mimic it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I found them, I saw Eli just standing there,\u201d I continue. Tears spill over my lids, and Jake wipes them with a fingertip. \u201cHe was surrounded by several punk kids, and one was lying on the ground.\u201d I look up. \u201cIt was that kid I followed into St. Giles\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Something flickers in Jake\u2019s eyes. Recognition?</p><p>\u201cI used my suggestion to make them back off of Eli, and they did. But then the three showed up.\u201d I look at Jake. \u201cThe Fallen. I knew right away it was them. I try first to make Eli run. It doesn\u2019t work. And neither does it work on the three. The one . . . he just smiled at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContinue,\u201d Jake encourages. He pushes my hair off my face.</p><p>\u201cI yell and yell to Eli in my mind, but he ignores me. Then beating wings, and flashing light and shadow,\u201d I say, \u201cand in a blink, Eli changed\u2014complete vampiric change\u2014and just . . . stood there. Two of them,\u201d I recall, \u201cliterally tossed the punk kids across the tunnel, and their heads smashed against the concrete wall.\u201d The vision makes me squeeze my eyes shut. \u201cDead. They were all dead.\u201d I open my eyes and look at Jake. \u201cExcept for Ian, on the ground. The third Fallen picks him up and holds him, suspended in the air. Then another Fallen grabs Eli and they both fall in front of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Jake presses his fingers gently against my lips, shushing me. \u201cI know,\u201d he says, and scrapes my tears. \u201cI know that part, Riley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happened so fast,\u201d I continue, my voice cracking. \u201cI couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t speak out loud\u2014nothing. Powerless. Just like Eli.\u201d I close my eyes and rub. Hard. \u201cIt\u2019s like . . . all these damn tendencies I have? Worthless, Jake.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cNothing I have is worth shit now. Don\u2019t you get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne Fallen is bad enough,\u201d he says. \u201cBut to stand alone against three? Impossible even for one of us,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s why the whole team is here.\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. They were supposed to still be regenerating. They came out of nowhere.\u201d I reached into my shirt and grabbed Eli\u2019s medallion. I hold it up to Jake. \u201cThe one Fallen, who held the kid up? He gave me this after. It\u2019s Eli\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Jake stares at it. \u201cYou saw no trace of neither Eli nor the Fallen who took him?\u201d</p><p>I look at him. \u201cTook him? He threw him in front of a train, Jake.\u201d</p><p>Jake nods. \u201cAye. So it seems.\u201d He squeezes my hands in his. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out, Riley. I vow it.\u201d</p><p>Tears scorch my eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait to inform his family. This has to be settled first,\u201d Jake offers.</p><p>A surge of pain beats inside of me at his words, and I squeeze my eyes shut. \u201cI hate this, Jake. This isn\u2019t me. This isn\u2019t right.\u201d I feel Eli\u2019s medallion against my chest. The ring he gave me on my finger. \u201cIt\u2019s not. I still feel him here,\u201d I slap my chest, above my heart. \u201cHe isn\u2019t gone. I just know it.\u201d</p><p>The weight of Jake\u2019s hand on my cheek makes me open my eyes. He\u2019s studying me, his stare just as profound as Eli\u2019s. \u201cDo you want to go back home?\u201d</p><p>Part of me does. Part of me wants to curl up into a fetal ball and die, go back to Eli\u2019s family, my brother, Nyx, Preacher, and Estelle, and mourn. Confusion webs through my brain.</p><p>\u201cLet me think on it,\u201d I say, turning onto my side. I close my eyes. The tears start again.</p><p>Jake silently rises and leaves the room. The door clicks behind him. I\u2019m alone.</p><p>Alone. Without Eli.</p><p>Pulling my knees to my chest, I wrap my arms around them, clutch them tightly, and silently sob myself to sleep.</p><p>Something I should\u2019ve never done.</p><p>I can\u2019t determine the exact moment my body gave way to narcoleptic sleep, but I last recall Eli\u2019s image.</p><p>He\u2019s close to me, staring down with those intense cerulean eyes that are the Dupr\u00e9 trademark, and it\u2019s kind of weird to be able to see so much love in those eyes, but I do. I can vaguely even remember sometimes that he is . . . what he is. But then he smiles, moves toward me, as if for a kiss or an embrace, and suddenly shadows swallow his features and I can\u2019t see him anymore. He pauses, cocks his head to the side as if studying me, and continues to move toward me.</p><p>Only then do I realize it\u2019s no longer Eli. He is male, though. This I know from the shift in his posture, the change in his movement, and the aura between us. There\u2019s a surge of power emanating from this new being, and it\u2019s . . . overwhelming. It\u2019s almost inexplicable . . . it\u2019s everywhere, in the air, and I breathe it in as if an inescapable vapor. Yet not a vapor. Not a mist and not just air. It\u2019s him. Almost suffocating.</p><p>And highly intoxicating.</p><p>Then he moves again, the shadows recede, and his features are illuminated by candlelight. I vaguely notice my surroundings: stone walls, not all intact, dark, damp, cold, and ancient. All I can do is focus on him. I\u2019m entranced, unwillingly so. Swear to God, I can\u2019t help myself. It\u2019s like I\u2019m being forced, but . . . not. Curiously, I study him.</p><p>Tall. Broad shoulders. Hair is light, long, and wavy, and some of it hangs loose about his face, brushes his jaw, catches on his full bottom lip. His nose is straight, jaw strong, throat masculine with pronounced columns and Adam\u2019s apple. Perfect brows arch over exotic eyes, wide yet almond shaped at corners that slightly tip upward. They study me with such intensity, I want to look away. But I can\u2019t. They\u2019re light in color. I can\u2019t tell what color, though. Too dark in this place. Hazel or green, if I had to guess. Mesmerizing, without a doubt.</p><p>Then he smiles. It\u2019s a sensual, wide, almost shy smile, and it hits me square in the chest. Straight, even white teeth, his incisors just a slight bit pointed, but not vampire pointed. His gaze holds mine.</p><p>\u201cYou are even more beautiful up close,\u201d he says, and his voice is not too deep, not high at all, and a little raspy. His brogue is heavy, ancient, the word close sounding more like cloose. Slowly, his hand lifts to my cheek. \u201cBe strong,\u201d he says, and his eyes follow his knuckle, then return to me. \u201cI will watch over you. I\u2019ve been assigned to do so and I will until my dying breath. And in the end, when all is over, you\u2019ll know. And you\u2019ll choose. And you will be content. I vow it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho are you? I\u2019ll choose what? And where are we?\u201d I finally ask, finding my voice but startled to hear that it\u2019s soft, unsure, and hesitant. When did I become such a wimp? What I should do is kick the guy in the balls, grab him by the throat, and sling him against the stone wall. Maybe even give him a little door prize for our meeting, like a nick on the cheek with one of my blades.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t happen. None of it does.</p><p>He smiles again and moves a step closer to me. The candlelight flickers at his movement, causing shadows to shimmy across his face. With a crooked finger he lifts my chin, and I wait as his head bows closer to mine. Electricity soars through my veins, unwanted, uninvited, but there all the same, and his lips pass by mine so closely, they nearly touch. Instead, though, his mouth moves to my ear.</p> <p>\u201cSoon,\u201d he answers, hovering close to me for several seconds while I stand there shivering. \u201cVerra soon.\u201d</p><p>When he pulls away, his face, his body, is encased in shadow once more.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I say, waiting for him to step back into the light.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t. A soft, deep chuckle emerges from his outline just before the slow, strong beating of a single pair of wings meets my ears.</p><p>\u201cPlease, love, wake up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEli!\u201d I gasp, and bolt up in the bed. It\u2019s dark, and although my eyes scan the room, I\u2019m dazed, it\u2019s hazy, and I\u2019m confused as Hell. Long shadows stretch across the floor and walls. I have no idea how long I\u2019ve been out, but it seems like forever.</p><p>\u201cAll day you\u2019ve been fast asleep.\u201d</p><p>My heart is beating hard. Freaking hard. Not faster, as it doesn\u2019t do that anymore, but hard. So hard I can feel it through my shirt. It feels as though someone is pumping a syringe of adrenaline straight into my artery with each heavy thump. Who the hell was that?</p><p>A hand finds mine and cool fingers link through my warm ones and grasp gently. \u201cShh. Calm down, Riley. It\u2019s me. Victorian.\u201d A lamp at the bedside turns on.</p><p>\u201cVic,\u201d I say. I\u2019ll worry about the dream later. Just a dream. Not real. And it wasn\u2019t Victorian. No one I know.</p><p>Then it all rushes back. \u201cOh, God,\u201d I mutter. It really happened. It\u2019s real.</p> <p>Pain crushes my chest and doubles me over, and I draw up my knees, press my forehead to them, and try to breathe. I don\u2019t cry, though. I think my tears have dried up. I just . . . grunt. Groan against the pain. It almost sounds ridiculous, and I can\u2019t even help it.</p><p>Victorian\u2019s hand moves over my back, then to my neck. \u201cRiley, don\u2019t,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cI may not have had any love for your man, but I did respect him. I respected how he cared for you inevitably. And I know Dupr\u00e9 would insist on your strength in overcoming this. It will get better,\u201d he says in a soothing tone. \u201cAll things eventually do.\u201d He pushes my hair aside, strokes it. \u201cYou were talking in your sleep, love. To whom?\u201d</p><p>It comes back to me. That . . . person. Man. In the dream. I know I\u2019ve never seen him before. I would\u2019ve remembered. Yet there was something familiar about him at the same time. It doesn\u2019t make sense, and I shake my head. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d I answer, and I cross my legs. I look at Victorian, who sits close to me on the bed. His beautiful face is illuminated by the glow of the lamp. Only now do I realize I\u2019m not even in my room. Victorian\u2019s dark brown eyes catch the light and shine as he studies me in silence.</p><p>\u201cThis is impossible, Vic,\u201d I finally say, and shake my head again. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how it happened. How something like this can happen,\u201d I say, staring at him, \u201cto one of you.\u201d</p><p>Vic watches me closely. \u201cThe Fallen have powers beyond us, I fear,\u201d he says. \u201cMore so than any of us expected. You will have to be guarded much closer. After all, you\u2019re still only a fragile human, regardless of your incredible strength.\u201d</p><p>Something about that just doesn\u2019t sit right with me. Even before the tendencies, I was far from fragile. \u201cJake wouldn\u2019t have brought me in if I was just a weak human, Vic.\u201d I push off the bed and turn to look at him.</p><p>Now I\u2019m pissed.</p><p>For a flash second, I think I see a slight grin on his face. Prick.</p> <p>Not waiting to see if he follows me, I head downstairs. To the others. My team.</p><p>Inside, I separate myself into two people. The woman who now has her heart ripped in half and mourns the loss of her fianc\u00e9. I shove the pain aside, and I actually feel it as it recedes into the darkness of my too-recent memory. There\u2019ll be time later for mourning. For tears. For heartache. Not now.</p><p>Because I\u2019m also the woman who not only has a personal score to settle, but my own race to protect. I\u2019m far from average. I can run. Jump. Fight like a wildcat.</p><p>I can kill. And I can make almost anyone do anything with my mind.</p><p>And I won\u2019t stop until all of the Black Fallen are nothing but fucking dust.</p><p>As I ease down the corridor, I allow the shadowy, eerie halls of the Crescent to consume me. There\u2019s something here, and I feel it. I allow myself to be enveloped by it. I become shadows. Aged darkness. Callous. Edgy. Treacherous.</p><p>Just as I near the landing to the steps, I see her again. The little girl. She emerges from a small recess in the wall, an alcove.</p><p>Our eyes meet; my green ones to her yawning black ones. With her skin illuminated, she almost glows. Instead of slowing down, I pass right by her. Before I take the first descending step, she disappears.</p><p>I don\u2019t know why, but we connect.</p><p>I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find out what she wants soon enough.</p><p>Downstairs, I slip through the darkened halls and chambers of the Crescent. I find the others still in the library. As I enter, I pull my loose hair back into a ponytail. I shake myself mentally, ready for the fight.</p><p>And inside of me, I will not give up on Eli. Until I know for absolute, positive sureness that he\u2019s dead, I\u2019ll not give in to it.</p><p>I have a Pictish scathe, holy water cartridges, and an ancient verse for protection.</p><p>And I\u2019m going to fucking use them all.</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d Noah says, rising to meet me. \u201cSydney found something.\u201d</p><p>His eyes lock with mine, and we share a long look before I acknowledge. In Noah\u2019s face I can see he understands that I\u2019ve compartmentalized my feeling. What I\u2019ve done to see this through. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I ask.</p><p>I glance over and see Jake, Gabriel, and Darius all hovering around Sydney. She looks up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty positive it\u2019s a clue to the location of the first relic,\u201d Sydney says. Her blond hair hangs straight past her shoulders, and she glances back down at the aged tome she\u2019s been searching through. \u201cIf my calculations are right and they coincide with the paragraph I found, it lies somewhere beneath the medical research center at the university.\u201d She looks at me. \u201cThe morgue.\u201d</p><p>I blink. \u201cBeneath it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Darius answers. \u201cAt one time that ground was hallowed. Catacombs run below Old Town and below the university as well, although many are either filled in or haven\u2019t been stepped into in centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we move through the city now?\u201d Noah asks. \u201cThe Fallen know we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t be certain that the attack on Eli wasn\u2019t just a random thing,\u201d Jake says. \u201cThey could\u2019ve noticed nothing more than that he was a vampire and wanted to toy with him. But thanks to some potent root doctor magic, we\u2019ve something to help shield us,\u201d Jake says, \u201cfrom the Fallen.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cFor a while anyway.\u201d</p><p>I already know what he means. Potions. Similar to the ones I took for so many years to mask the heavy scent of my blood. Preacher must\u2019ve sent some with us. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I say, anxious to get moving. I have nervous energy now\u2014energy that needs to be spent. Pacing, my eyes are on Jake. Waiting.</p><p>He watches me closely. As do the others. I already know they have reservations about me because of what just happened to Eli.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Yes, I\u2019m dying inside,\u201d I say, and meet their gazes. \u201cBut if you think I\u2019m just gonna sit around while you guys fry the Fallen, then you don\u2019t know me very well.\u201d I meet Gabriel\u2019s gaze, then Darius\u2019s, then Jake\u2019s.</p><p>Victorian, now standing behind me, puts a hand to my lower back. \u201cI\u2019ll stay by her side\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you will,\u201d Noah says angrily, and stands and moves directly in front of Victorian, meeting his hard gaze head-on. \u201cI still don\u2019t trust you, Arcos. Eli never did, and I damn sure don\u2019t trust you with my dead friend\u2019s woman.\u201d He steps closer. \u201cSo back the fuck off.\u201d</p><p>When Noah gets pissed, it\u2019s something you have to witness for yourself. Usually a flirt, a jokester, when he\u2019s pissed off he is a force to be reckoned with. In that quiet, crazy, Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon kind of way.</p><p>I put a hand on Noah\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Seriously.\u201d I look at Vic. \u201cI can handle myself without a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley, you\u2019ll be with Miles, Gabriel, and me,\u201d Jake says, making the final decision. He looks at Vic. \u201cArcos, you\u2019re with Darius and the lupines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Sydney?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cShe stays and continues her research through the volumes,\u201d Jake says. \u201cGabriel has a protective ring surrounding the Crescent. She\u2019ll be safe for now.\u201d</p><p>Just then, old Peter bustles into the room.</p><p>\u201cCome get your magic juice!\u201d he calls out with a chuckle. He reminds me of Tootles from the movie Hook. And, yes, I truly believe he has lost his marbles. He has two pots of steaming something on a large tray. He sets it down on a side table, then bustles back out. Moments later he returns with another tray, this one loaded with cups. A paper sack, top rolled shut, sits beside them. One by one, he sets out the cups and fills them with the hot liquid. My root doctor grandfather\u2019s art at work.</p><p>\u201cDrink up,\u201d Jake says, and steps over to grab a cup for himself. He takes the paper bag, opens it, and pulls something else out. A smile touches his mouth as he loosens the object, and a small silk satchel attached to a leather cord dangles from his fingers. He hands one to each of the vampires and the lupines, and even though I don\u2019t believe it will work on me, I take one anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPreacher says this is just in case our blood or venom won\u2019t accept the potion,\u201d Jake offers.</p><p>I slip mine over my head, bring the pouch to my nose, and sniff. Immediately, the inside of Da Plat Eye, Preacher and Estelle\u2019s potions shop, rushes to my memory. For a second, I\u2019m so homesick I can feel my stomach actually hurting. Dried jasmine, crushed sand dollar, burnt saw grass, and a few other scents I don\u2019t recognize. All of it, I\u2019m sure, is blessed with one of Preacher\u2019s root-doctor charms. It rests against Eli\u2019s medallion on my chest. I grab a cup, bring it to my lips, and drain it.</p><p>You know I am just a thought away, Riley. If you need me, call. I will come.</p> <p>That from Vic, and I shoot him a quick glance and nod.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d I say, anxious to move. Anxious to ash the bastards who took Eli away from me.</p><p>Everyone drains their cups. Those who have Preacher\u2019s talismans slip them on. Noah doesn\u2019t think twice about his. Ginger and Lucian, the lupines, both sniff it, make a face, and tuck them beneath their shirts. I think about taking the scathe, but I decide it\u2019s not time yet. I leave it stashed in my room. Soon we\u2019re all geared up, swords hidden beneath dark coats, and talismans filled with an ancient Gullah charm, and we head out into the misty Edinburgh night.</p><p>Darkness had fallen again since I\u2019d returned from the streets this morning. God almighty, I\u2019d spent all day sleeping and dreaming. Before we take off, a hand finds my arm. I turn to find Ginger standing there, her eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says, and doesn\u2019t take it further. \u201cIf you need a girl to talk to, I\u2019m here.\u201d</p> <p>I give a short nod. \u201cThanks, but I\u2019ll be ok.\u201d</p><p>Ginger looks at me with a solemn gaze, returns the nod, then finds her mate, Lucian.</p><p>If I give in to that, to spilling my guts to another female, I\u2019ll lose it.</p><p>I can\u2019t afford to lose it. Maybe later, but not now. Hell, no.</p><p>Jake stands before me, his impossibly hulking figure throwing a shadow completely over me. I glance up.</p><p>\u201cCan you handle this?\u201d he asks. He\u2019s not condescending, not sympathetic. He\u2019s matter-of-fact.</p> <p>I nod. \u201cI got it.\u201d</p><p>He watches me a few seconds longer, then nods. He addresses the others. \u201cLet\u2019s go. We\u2019re headed to Teviot Place, at the university.\u201d</p><p>The groups separate once more, and Darius takes his one street over, to Cowgate, and we slip into the sidewalk crowd and head up the Royal Mile, toward the castle. I walk fast, one hand in my coat pocket, the other against the hilt of my sword. Locals amble up and down the Mile, some heading to pubs, some just getting off work. Jake is in front of me; Noah\u2019s behind me. Eli should be beside me. . . .</p><p>Riley, get it together, babe.</p><p>I turn and shoot Noah a look. You get it together. Noah stares, waiting for a decent answer, I guess, but I give myself a mental shake and push Eli back to the shadows of my mind. Noah\u2019s right. Gotta have my head fully in this. Fight now; everything else, later.</p><p>Weaving through people carrying steaming coffee from the local grind, others moving fast, head down, hands shoved into their pockets, and others\u2014youth\u2014moving in groups, loud and raucously, we finally turn left at George IV and head toward the university. The mist is heavy now, not only visually, but also the scent of the Firth of Forth hangs thickly inside of it, filled with rotting seaweed and sea life, saltwater and God knows what else. Taxi horns blast every once in a while, and as I glance up, the lights illuminating Edinburgh Castle form a beacon to the city. Voices fill my head, and they\u2019re the voices all around me, in front of me, behind me.</p><p>Meet me at the Mercat Cross in thirty minutes.</p><p>I\u2019m no\u2019 feckin\u2019 tha\u2019 bitch! Are you feckin\u2019 daft, girl?</p> <p>Vinegar and brown sauce?</p><p>Give me a pint, aye?</p><p>I concentrate, push aside the voices, and filter through the mass of people\u2019s random conversations until the only sounds surrounding me are those of my footsteps, of Noah walking behind me, and Jake and Gabriel walking ahead of me. There\u2019s something else I hear, too. I\u2019m not sure what. I can only describe it as a low, subtle hum. Almost like an electrical buzz, but even more faint than that. It\u2019s weird. No matter how much I try to push it out of my senses, it stays. It won\u2019t clear out. Soon, we cross Candlemaker\u2019s Row and onto Teviot. University goers mill about, and a young couple passes us. The guy has a cigarette dangling off his lips, and he\u2019s walking with his arm draped around a pretty girl dressed in head-to-toe black, with a bright purple scarf wrapped fashionably around her neck. The girl looks at me as they pass, her eyes darting to my inked wings. \u201cFeckin\u2019 ripped,\u201d I hear her whisper to her guy friend, who gives me a curious look. \u201cAye,\u201d he answers her. But just that fast, they move away and into the other passersby meandering along the walkways.</p><p>Jake leads us down a narrow close\u2014I don\u2019t even catch the name of it\u2014but it goes down a long, even narrower flight of aged steps. The walls are close and smell of wet stone, and not a soul is around. Just us. Ahead of me, I look at Jake\u2019s wide, broad back and shoulders and wonder how in Hell he and Gabriel can walk straight through. Then they stop and half-turn to us. I throw a look over my shoulder. Noah is behind me, and Darius, Vic, Ginger, and Lucian have joined us. Jake\u2019s eyes catch a slender beam of light pouring in from the streetlamp above us.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re beneath one of three medical labs in this section of the university,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re side-by-side, as are the chambers through this entrance. \u201cIt\u2019s dark as Hell in here, and passages you don\u2019t even think exist, do.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cEasy to get lost. I\u2019ve done it. Many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is just another entrance to the catacombs?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he answers. \u201cThey virtually run course beneath all of Old Town. Some are caved in; some are easy enough to navigate.\u201d In that beam of light I see Jake\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cBut be careful. They can be treacherous even for the experienced.\u201d He inclines his head to my pocket. \u201cUse your torch, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we looking for, Andorra?\u201d Lucian asks.</p><p>Jake glances over my head to stare at Lucian. \u201cAccording to Sydney, a stone embedded in the corner wall of a chamber. The stone will have a tilted impression of a cross. By now \u2019tis barely visible, so it won\u2019t be easy to spot. Once we find the stone, we have to wedge it out. Whatever the relic is, \u2019twill be there.\u201d</p><p>Lucian\u2019s silence signals an okay to proceed.</p><p>My hand goes for the mini flashlight I carry in the pocket of my coat.</p><p>With a final glance at us all, Jake pushes open a rickety old wooden door and ducks through the entrance. I turn my light on and follow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right behind you,\u201d Noah says in my ear. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d</p><p>I jab his gut with my elbow. \u201cYou mean like that?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s grunt is the only response I get. Along with a nice swear word.</p><p>My eyes try to focus in the dark, but they don\u2019t. Can\u2019t. It\u2019s an absolute pitch-black abyss down here and the only thing I can see is what my flashlight beam alights on. It\u2019s crazy. The floor is stone, some loose pebbles, and dirt. Uneven. Good thing I wore my Nikes, or I\u2019d surely bust my ass. This is worse than the cobbles on River Street back home.</p><p>We\u2019re in one big chamber right now, all of us, and Jake shines his flashlight to his face. \u201cWe need to split up and check out these other rooms and be done with this place. I dunna like it.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t like it, either. Feels like . . . death. Old death. Like plague-riddled death.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll break into twos. Search the walls near corners for a misplaced stone. You\u2019ll have to feel it with your fingers for the cross, more likely than not. It\u2019s been here for almost a thousand years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Noah says, and grabs my elbow. \u201cYou\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one with the flashlight,\u201d I answer, and yank my arm free. \u201cYou\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>Noah chuckles. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>We head off down a ribbonlike corridor to another chamber. Noah has to turn sideways to wedge through the narrow gap of rock. Inside the chamber, I arc my flashlight, the beam sweeping the stone room. \u201cLet\u2019s start on opposite sides of the room and feel with our hands,\u201d I say. \u201cYou take that corner; I\u2019ll take this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Noah says, and moves across the room.</p><p>Within minutes, we\u2019re done. \u201cI don\u2019t feel anything,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cMe neither,\u201d I answer. \u201cLet\u2019s go into the next chamber.\u201d</p><p>We do, and again find nothing.</p><p>The tink-tink of water dripping and hitting something reverberates in my ears. It\u2019s weird how stone has a scent, but it does. It smells like cold and wet. And something else. Years. It smells like lots and lots of years.</p><p>Then, I hear it. It\u2019s louder now. That annoying hum in my head. It\u2019s almost like a ringing in my ears now. Borderline painful.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Noah asks.</p><p>I shake my head and glance around. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I . . . hear something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa!\u201d Noah yells, and pushes me aside just before something flies straight at me. I stumble against the wall and look up.</p><p>\u201cRiley, run!\u201d Noah yells as he morphs into a full-fledged vampire.</p><p>I rub my eyes and look. Old decaying cherub statues have loosened from their places, only they\u2019re not sweet little fat-faced babies. They have long, jagged teeth, and there\u2019s at least a half dozen of them flying straight at us. What the hell?</p><p>\u201cRiley, damn it, run!\u201d Noah hollers.</p><p>I take off down a dank passage, running as fast as the narrow, low-ceilinged corridors will allow. I take turn after turn, those freaky little fanged cherubs crashing into walls as they chase me down. Further back, I hear Noah swearing.</p><p>I stumble into a chamber and immediately notice it\u2019s different in here. Not the same. Am I in an alternative catacombs now? How the hell did that happen? Everything is in sepia, overgrown with moss, darkened by shadows. A light flickers. When I blink, Eli is standing there. It\u2019s him. I see his face. \u201cEli!\u201d I yell. I try to run toward him, but I can\u2019t. My feet won\u2019t move. Slowly, though, he steps toward me. I knew he wasn\u2019t dead. \u201cEli, hurry!\u201d I call to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then, his beautiful smile drops, and dozens of sharp pointed teeth lower from his gums. He\u2019s moving straight toward me. \u201cEli! Goddamn it!\u201d I try to run, but I can\u2019t even lift my foot. I think to grab my silver blade, but my hands won\u2019t budge, either.</p><p>A figure flies past me and slams into the alternative Eli. Both hit the wall, and when one rises, he flies toward me so fast, I don\u2019t have time to blink. It\u2019s Noah. I know his scent. He grabs me and rushes me out of the chamber. Through darkened passageways we race, my feet barely touching the stone flooring. Finally, we stumble into another chamber. I drop to my knees immediately. That humming sound. It\u2019s so potent in my ears, it\u2019s making me sick.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jake is there, asking. The ringing in my ears is so loud, I can barely hear Noah\u2019s words as he explains. \u201cRiley?\u201d Jake is shaking me, then helping me up. I cup my hands over my ears. The pain is searing into my brain.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you, girl?\u201d Jake yells at me.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d I hear Ginger\u2019s voice in a distant chamber. \u201cI think I found it.\u201d</p><p>Noah, standing right next to me, grabs my hand holding the flashlight and points it at his face. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>The ringing is overwhelming. I take off running. Blindly. I don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m heading. Just . . . away from that sound. I think I\u2019m moving toward the exit of the catacombs, but even as I hear Noah\u2019s swears softening behind me, I duck into another chamber. The ringing isn\u2019t quite as loud now. I must be near the street side. I see a door. I move toward it.</p><p>Riley, wait. Don\u2019t go.</p> <p>I stop in my tracks and tune in my hearing. Only that dripping water sound. The other WUP members in another chamber. The wind, squeaking in through some miniscule cracks, and it\u2019s almost a whine or a moan. Not a voice.</p><p>This way. Please.</p><p>My body turns toward the voice, and I arc my light across the room. Empty.</p><p>Left.</p><p>I shine my light left, and it falls on a small passageway. Something is drawing me that way. More than the voice. A familiar sensation comes over me, and the first thing that pops into my head is Eli.</p><p>Hurrying now, I squeeze into the passage, and it empties into a long threadlike hallway of stone. I move as quickly as possible, my flashlight providing only a small patch of light to keep me from stepping into holes or tripping over loose stones. Far ahead, a light flickers.</p> <p>You\u2019re almost here. Hurry.</p><p>Eli. All I can think of is Eli. It might be him. How, I don\u2019t know, but it might. I have to find him.</p><p>I step into the chamber with the flickering light, and all at once it extinguishes. A force\u2014not a hand, but a force\u2014knocks the flashlight from me. It clamors to the stone floor and goes out, leaving me in total darkness.</p><p>All at once the sensation of being crowded envelopes me. Warmth. Sensual arousal penetrates my rock-hard senses, and I feel weak. It\u2019s like a drug, and my body involuntarily moves toward it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not been able to think of anything else, save you,\u201d a seductively raspy voice says. \u201cI had to see you again.\u201d</p><p>I blink in the darkness. \u201cI can\u2019t see you now. Who are you? And what . . . are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not who you think I am,\u201d he answers. His voice is oddly ancient, with a medieval accent, sort of like Darius\u2019s. Yet different. \u201cI have no intentions of harming you, Riley.\u201d He gives a low, soft laugh. \u201cTrust me. That\u2019s anything but my intention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask if you were going to harm me,\u201d I say, forcing my eyes to remain open, even in the pitch-darkness. \u201cWho the hell are you?\u201d I\u2019m not physically restrained. Yet . . . I can\u2019t seem to move. Except closer to him.</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter right now. I just . . . had to see you,\u201d his words brush my jaw, my throat, and it\u2019s intoxicating. I can\u2019t help it. I lean into it. Into him. \u201cI will watch over you,\u201d he whispers, his lips grazing mine. \u201cI vow, nothing will happen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d</p><p>An arc of light sweeps the cold, dank room, and immediately my body is released from the shackles even I can\u2019t detect. I shake my head a few times, just long enough for Noah to reach me. I look at him, and his face is angry.</p><p>Seriously angry.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d he says, and looks me over. \u201cWhere did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, apparently I went here,\u201d I answer. \u201cI thought I heard something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your best course of action is to find that something instead of alerting the rest of us?\u201d he answers. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Meet me, Riley. Beneath lights, so I am no longer a shadow to you. In three days, at the Marimae House, in New Town. Seven p.m. Dress formal. I\u2019ll find you. And come alone. I don\u2019t wish to share you with another soul. . . .</p><p>Quietly, I push the seductive voice out of my head and follow a fuming Noah, who has confiscated someone\u2019s flashlight out of the chambers. That humming, ringing in my ears is strengthening again, and its pain rips into the side of my head. I almost drop to my knees. I stumble along, following Noah. We wind through the passageways of the catacombs until we meet up with Jake and the others. Ginger is pointing her light toward him. In his hand, Jake holds a small, old-as-dirt-looking cross. Part of it is broken off. He looks up at me. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when I notice the shadows.</p><p>All at once, medieval shit hits the fan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll not take that anywhere, I fear,\u201d a voice says from the darkness. It\u2019s a voice I don\u2019t recognize; poignant, refined, and sophisticated. He almost sounds apologetic.</p><p>\u201cI fucking damn well will take it,\u201d Jake says, not quite so refined. Even in the darkness, I can hear the tone and pitch of his voice change. He\u2019s morphed. Ready for a fight.</p><p>Someone, I think Ginger, arcs her beam in the direction of the voice.</p><p>What the light illuminates is somewhat shocking. Even if for a second.</p><p>A woman. Midthirties, maybe, with an abundance of blond hair. Suddenly I recognize her. She\u2019s the tour group leader in the long cloak. I\u2019d also seen her outside of Bene\u2019s. She\u2019s wearing head-to-toe black\u2014I can\u2019t make out exactly what, other than the color. She looks dead ahead at Jake and pulls a knife. Silver. Sharp.</p><p>And smiles.</p><p>Hey, Blondie. Ease on out of the chamber. Now. I say to the stranger, in my mind.</p><p>She stands there, still smiling, but slowly starts to back out. She doesn\u2019t see me, though, and that\u2019s a good thing. That\u2019s right. Keep going. When you\u2019re on the street, head to the castle. Don\u2019t stop until you reach the front gates, and then shout to be let inside.</p><p>The woman says nothing as she continues to back out of the chamber and into the close. She\u2019s almost ready to turn when behind her emerge four more figures from the close. They\u2019re big. And I\u2019d smelled them before I\u2019d seen them.</p><p>Jod\u00eds. And the one in front grabs the woman and in one movement rips her heart from her chest. The ringing in my ears now is deafening. I can\u2019t hear anything else. The woman\u2019s scream dies on the misty night even before her body hits the stone, jerking and kicking. It sort of shocks me. I\u2019m not ready for it, and it\u2019s shaken me up a bit.</p><p>Pull it together, Riley, Jake says in my head. After a deep breath, I do.</p><p>Only a small stream of light from the lamp on the close shines through, just enough illumination to see the Jod\u00eds lunge toward us. I hear Noah curse. Lucian says something. I don\u2019t know what it is. Gaelic, maybe.</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d Ginger calls, inching closer.</p><p>\u201cRight here,\u201d I answer her, and we\u2019re back to back now. Lucian wants her as far away from him right now as possible. I hear her heart racing. \u201cStay with me,\u201d I say, and I reach for my sword. God almighty, I hope I lop off the right head. Ginger has reached for her sword, too.</p><p>Then it begins.</p><p>One Jod\u00eds lunges toward us, and I use the point of my sword as a brace, rear back, and kick both feet into its chest. Hard. It falls back but bounces right up and lunges again. Another lunges at the same time, and I hear Ginger\u2019s sword make contact. Then we\u2019re separated.</p><p>I\u2019m fighting one alone now, and from the sounds going on around me, everyone has their own Jod\u00eds to fight. I concentrate on mine alone, and the ringing in my ears is getting harder to ignore. It\u2019s confusing me, and my balance if thrown off. Still, I fight. I wait, weigh, calculate; then it charges me, arm reaching out to grab my throat. With an uppercut, I swing.</p><p>One Jod\u00eds head rolls across the stone.</p><p>The aftermath of a dying Jod\u00eds is just too nasty to stand by and watch. I\u2019ve seen it once before, when Sydney touched me. They melt into this screaming, gross puddle of white pus. The screaming has already begun. I seek out the others.</p><p>Another head hits the floor, and from Noah\u2019s curse, he did it. Two more soon follow, and the squirming piles of Jod\u00eds are just too much to take. I literally fall out of the catacomb entrance and onto the close. Only then do I notice something.</p><p>The woman\u2019s body has disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d she go?\u201d I ask, looking around. I shove my sword back into its sheath.</p><p>Jake\u2019s face has not returned to its human form. His eerie eyes, now white with a pinpoint dot of red, scan the close.</p><p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t here for us,\u201d Gabriel says. \u201cThey came for her,\u201d he says, referring to the woman. \u201cI know who she is. I\u2019ve encountered her before. She\u2019s one of the Gemini.\u201d His gaze finds mine. \u201cA small sect of modern-day monster hunters determined to take back the city of Edinburgh. Just like that group of humans from before. They know of us. They know of the Jod\u00eds. And they probably know of the Fallen.\u201d He searches the area once more, then inclines his head. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Thank God, because that freaking hum in my ears is so loud now, I think I\u2019m going to pass out. We all separate and head back to the Crescent. The humming is weak now. I can still hear it, but it\u2019s tolerable. Maybe I\u2019ve got an ear infection or something . . . human like that? Who knows? The activity on the streets has slowed to a drag, only a truck or two still out along with the cabs. People still mill about, locals leaving pubs and heading home. We\u2019re almost to Old Tolbooth Wynd when a woman\u2019s scream breaks through the misty night. My ears pick up a muffled whimpering. It\u2019s one lane over from Old Tolbooth. And the stench is unmistakable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Another Jod\u00eds.</p><p>The kirk. I run toward it, not waiting to see who follows me. I hear Noah swear and say my name under his breath, and he\u2019s probably right behind me. The girl . . . her pulse is fast. Her breaths are faster. The distinct sound of fingernails clawing at gravel cuts through my senses, and I hurry. Although a lamp illuminates the churchyard, it\u2019s empty, and I make the black wrought-iron gate in an effortless leap. Crouching as I land, I scan the area. The kirk\u2019s front is adorned by a circular glass window at the top and flanked by a pair of oblong windows with a crest in between. No lights are on. No one is here. Her heartbeat, so slow now it barely beats, is coming from around the back of the church. Then the beating stops altogether. Silence.</p><p>Through the darkness I run, haul ass, around the ancient stone structure and into the shadows. Abruptly, I halt. There in the gravel is a woman\u2019s body. I fall to my knees, and even though I can\u2019t hear her heart beating any longer, I still feel the pulse at her throat. Nothing. That\u2019s when I notice the gaping hole in her chest, heart gone.</p> <p>That\u2019s also when I notice her lifeless eyes staring wide, frightened, up at me. Lips slightly parted. Lifting one of her hands, I notice her fingertips are scraped and bleeding. She might be twenty years old, if that.</p><p>And I\u2019m too fucking late. Reaching over, I close her eyes.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Ri,\u201d Noah says beside me. \u201cNothing you can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know that,\u201d I answer angrily. I rise and just walk off. Noah\u2019s right behind me, and he leaps the gates a few seconds after me. Together we cross the street and head through the arches of Old Tolbooth Wynd.</p><p>\u201cThe only way to stop this is to stop them,\u201d Noah says, and I know he\u2019s right. \u201cStop the Fallen.\u201d</p> <p>Because apparently I can\u2019t even detect when an innocent is having her heart ripped out of her body until it\u2019s too frickin\u2019 late.</p><p>My arm is grabbed and my body swung around, and Noah is standing there, holding me in a tight grasp. \u201cLet it go, Ri. You have to. Let that girl go, and let Eli go. For now. You\u2019ve got to focus.\u201d His mercury gaze sears me. \u201cI\u2019ll be here for you. After. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I stare at Noah\u2019s beautiful features in the moonlight, and the slender dreads that have escaped the leather band holding them back. He looks nothing like Eli, yet he reminds me of him every time I look at him. Reminds me of what I have to do now. \u201cYeah, I know,\u201d I answer. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Noah play-slaps my cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s my kick-ass girl. Now let\u2019s go see what the relic says. Jake took it up to Sydney.\u201d</p><p>Giving Noah a nod, we continue up the wynd near the Crescent gates, and Peter must have known we were coming because the gates are open. The ringing in my ears grows louder and louder again. Damn, I might have to get that checked out. The closer we move to the front door, the louder it grows in my head. At the doorway, I stumble to my knees and cup my ears.</p><p>\u201cRi, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Noah asks. He\u2019s kneeling down, his hand on my back.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer. \u201cI think I have something wrong with my ears,\u201d I push my palms tighter against my head. \u201cThis humming is nonstop.\u201d</p><p>Noah helps me stand. \u201cWell, come on. Let\u2019s get you inside, human,\u201d he says.</p><p>I concentrate once more on siphoning the sound out of my head. It takes more concentration than before, but I do it. It\u2019s still in there, and it still hurts, but it\u2019s dull. Dull enough for me not to be babied and carried to my room. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I assure Noah. \u201cLet\u2019s find the others.\u201d</p><p>Inside, we find the others gathered in the library.</p><p>Jake looks up when we enter. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Riley. I could\u2019ve told you what you\u2019d find,\u201d he says solemnly. \u201cNo matter how fast you are, if a Jod\u00eds gets there first, there\u2019s virtually no hope for the innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty obvious,\u201d I say. \u201cI used top speed to get there and still didn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Fallen may have created the Jod\u00eds with the power of shifting,\u201d Gabriel says, his deep voice and odd accent breaking the air.</p><p>\u201cShifting?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>\u201cAye, space. From here to there,\u201d Gabriel says. \u201c\u2019Tis an ancient, magical way of transportation created by the Fae, back before Scotia was even Scotia. If \u2019tis a verse they can recall, they\u2019ll use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why don\u2019t they just shift the entire body?\u201d asks Lucian. \u201cWhy take their heart? Why so brutal?\u201d</p><p>Gabriel rubs his jaw. \u201cI can only imagine they\u2019re working with verra little in the form of common sense and intelligence with the Jod\u00eds,\u201d he answers. \u201cThey\u2019re conjured creatures, dunna forget. \u2019Tis easier for them to comprehend short commands. Like to bring just the part they need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got it,\u201d Sydney says from her corner desk. On it, lying atop a soft cloth, she has the aged cross Ginger found in the catacombs. Sydney stares through a large magnifying glass eyepiece. She lowers the piece and looks at us. \u201cIt reads\u2014\u201d Then she reads the inscription out loud and the language almost hurts to hear it. It\u2019s completely incomprehensible. Dolphins might as well be talking. It\u2019s that odd. I almost cover my ears.</p><p>\u201cBasically it says, Wherein the hallowed ground of the remnants that battled the painted warriors from the north, in the center of such a mass grave of bloodshed, lies what you seek. No matter time, \u2019twill remain the same until the one who reads it releases it. Oh\u2014 ouch! Shit!\u201d Sydney drops the relic onto the table and blows on her fingertips.</p><p>The moment the last word leaves Sydney\u2019s mouth, the cross turns red like embers, and as it lies on the table, it literally bursts into flames. Suddenly, the vicious humming inside of my head weakens. I take in a deep breath. The pain is gone. The humming is still there, but so faint, I can barely hear it. Sydney jumps back, and Gabriel grabs her by the arm and pulls her away from the table.</p><p>We stare as the cross turns to cinders.</p><p>\u201cI hope you have that memorized,\u201d Noah says, then shakes his head. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I do,\u201d Sydney answers. \u201cAnd I wrote it down.\u201d She looks at Gabriel. \u201cDidn\u2019t expect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor I,\u201d he returns. He looks at Jake. \u201c\u2019Tis a puzzle that requires more searching. Edinburgh is an ancient city, and before the castle was built, battles raged and lives ended.\u201d He looks at Darius. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find the spot where the Caledonians battled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are the they?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cThe early Picts,\u201d Darius answers. \u201cSavage fighters, they tattooed their faces and bodies to terrorize their opponents and make themselves seem more brutal.\u201d He half grins. \u201cGawan of Conwyk is such. As am I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should know precisely where to look.\u201d Victorian, who sits quietly in a far corner, is listening. He glances at me, his eyes warm and somewhat sorrowful.</p><p>\u201cI know where to start,\u201d Darius claims. \u201cMuch has changed over the centuries. The landscape, the construction\u2014while ancient in truth \u2019tis still changed from back then.\u201d He glances at Jake. \u201c\u2019Twill take some time.\u201d</p><p>Sirens from Canongate blast through the night, and I know the girl\u2019s body has been found at the kirk. It sickens me. A family\u2019s lives will forever be changed as they mourn the loss of their loved one. All because some selfish bastards want to remain on earth forever.</p><p>On the far wall, the flat screen is on a local news channel.</p><p>\u201cHey, turn that up,\u201d I say, and Noah takes the remote and turns up the volume. Moving closer, I sit on the arm of the sofa next to him and watch.</p><p>\u201cEdinburgh\u2019s streets are in peril after the discovery of yet another body found earlier this evening,\u201d the reporter says. \u201cA young male, approximately age nineteen, was found on the banks of the Firth. His identification is being withheld until all family have been notified. This makes the fourth young person in two weeks. Meanwhile, near Niddry street, another person has been found completely reduced to ashes. Is there a curse on Edinburgh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive,\u201d I say under my breath, thinking of the poor girl who was just slaughtered in the kirk yard. \u201cSeriously? A curse? They have the balls to say that on TV, with family members watching?\u201d I shake my head and pace. \u201cFucking idiot reporters.\u201d</p><p>The reporter continues. \u201cIs there a serial killer running amok in the streets of Old Town? The police are out in full swing to catch the person responsible for these heinous acts.\u201d</p><p>I stare at the flat screen and fixate on the video coverage. A black body bag is being hauled up the banks of the Firth by officers. Inside lays the heartless body of an innocent. Another one.</p><p>Weariness sets in, and I can feel my narcoleptic sleep about to kick in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to your room,\u201d Noah says beside me. He grins. \u201cI can see it on your face. You\u2019re about to go out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d I answer, and rise from the arm of the sofa. \u201cI can make it alone.\u201d I put my hand on his shoulder. \u201cThanks, though.\u201d I cock my head. \u201cYou\u2019re kinda sweet when you\u2019re not being a prick, Miles.\u201d</p><p>Noah shrugs. \u201cWhat can I say?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head and start across the library. As I pass Jake, I stop and look up at him. \u201cI\u2019ll only sleep a few hours. We gotta end this. Fast.\u201d</p><p>His green gaze sweeps over me. \u201cI know. Go rest.\u201d</p><p>With a slight nod, I leave. No sooner do I hit the staircase than a presence is felt, and I immediately know who it is.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you fall out while walking the stairs?\u201d Victorian says. \u201cYou could hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>I stop, turn, and stare up into Vic\u2019s brown gaze. \u201cNice try. I\u2019ve fought and killed rogue vampires. You think a little tumble down a staircase will hurt me?\u201d</p><p>With a shrug, Victorian places his hand to my lower back, and gives a little pressure to urge me to continue up the stairs. With him. He grins. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing I could think of.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d I answer, and begin the climb. The staircase is lit with muted amber lamps that cause shadows to dance on the walls as we pass. It\u2019s drafty, cool, and eerily quiet. We\u2019re almost to the landing to the second floor when I go out.</p><p>Like a light. Bam.</p><p>I vaguely remember arms around me, my body lifting up and seemingly floating down the corridor. Then all is still. I\u2019m in darkness.</p> <p>For a while.</p><p>When my eyes open next, the room is engulfed in heavy shadows. I\u2019m being held, suspended in air in a pair of strong arms. Confusion webs through my mind as I focus on the person carrying me. Well-known. Closeness. Yet . . . not. A man. His features are obscured by darkness. But other things make me want to stay; the feel of him seems . . . familiar. At least I think so. I\u2019m unsure. I pin him with a hot stare and a frown I can only hope he sees in the dark. \u201cLet. Me. Go.\u201d</p><p>Moonlight shifts into the room, and only a shade of his features is revealed. Something flashes in his darkened eyes briefly, and then it disappears, replaced by raw, male desire. Just seeing it makes the uncomfortable ache inside of me grow. He lowers his head, his lips touching mine. \u201cDon\u2019t leave. Please.\u201d He sets me down on the floor, his body crowding me close to the wall. I try to push past him, but again he begs me. Pleads. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>Releasing my hands, he drags a forefinger across my forehead, down the bridge of my nose, traces my jaw. His eyes follow his finger, as though amazed with each place he touches, and as though he\u2019s never done the like before. Then he holds my jaw and tilts my head.</p><p>And his mouth descends.</p> <p>As soon as his tongue touches mine, I lose control. I have no explanation; no reasoning. Only a strong sense of familiarity that makes this feel unstoppable. It\u2019s Eli. As soon as I shove my fingers into his hair and pull him closer, this man, this . . . shadow Eli man loses control.</p><p>More than passion fuels his movements\u2014I can feel it. It seems more like starvation, a primal, uncontrolled drive to satisfy basic needs, to mark what is his and to make sure no other dare try to take it away. That\u2019s what it feels like.</p><p>My lips are soft, pliable, and desperately seeking. They all but consume him. The urgency in my touch surprises me; the scrape of my nails through his shirt nearly drives him mad. He grabs the hem of my shirt and lifts it above my head, flinging it to the floor, his hands replacing the soft cotton as he moves them slowly down my arms, my ribs. \u201cI want to feel your skin against mine,\u201d he whispers. Feather light, his fingertips trace the dragons trailing down both of my arms. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he says, and I find I don\u2019t have the strength to answer him back. Sensations overwhelm me, every nerve ending is on fire, and there\u2019s a place deep inside of me that is dying to be satisfied.</p><p>I watch him watching me in the darkness, and without thinking, I lift a hand and stroke his jaw, his lips. I feel his body shudder beneath my touch. He allows me to unbutton his shirt and push it off his broad shoulders. Taut skin is found beneath my seeking fingers, as are corded muscle and prominent, healthy veins. Large hands. Strong biceps. I still see nothing more than a silhouette, yet I want him so badly it hurts. It literally aches inside of me. I understand none of it. Neither can I stop myself. This is Eli. But why can\u2019t I make out his features? Why?</p><p>As he peels the clothes from my body, I can hear his heart hammering against his chest. His hardness pushes at his groin and against my hip. With nimble fingers he unlatches the small metal front clasp of my bra and pushes the silky material to the side. His breath hitches in his throat as he stares at me. Then he turns me around. He says nothing, but his hands grasp either side of my ribs, then slowly begin to explore the intricate markings of my inked dragon. Callused hands slip around my stomach as his mouth finds my shoulder, kisses then my neck, then ear. \u201cYou\u2019re the most exquisite creature I\u2019ve ever encountered,\u201d he whispers, and pulls my lobe into his mouth. I shudder, and he turns me to face him. With his eyes fastened to mine, he sweeps me up in his arms and carries me to a bed, where he follows me down.</p><p>Moonlight streaks in through the window in a single beam, and that beam casts just enough illumination for me to see the outline of his features. He\u2019s . . . not Eli. He\u2019s breathtaking. I don\u2019t know him. Yet . . . the familiarity of him stuns me, urges me to touch him, return his kisses, and arch into his embrace. I can\u2019t stop. Is this Eli? My heart tells me it is. Yet my eyes reveal differently. The moonlight bathes his skin, making it strangely luminescent in the small hours of the night. He\u2019s stretched over me. Somewhere we both lost our clothes and are nothing but skin against skin. I arch into him and reach for him, my hands slipping over his muscular chest, then around his corded neck. It makes my skin tingle, my nerve endings sizzle. Blood pounds through my veins and rushes to my groin as his fingers trail my stomach, smoothing the feminine muscles there, tracing my ribs.</p> <p>My own nimble fingers trace the muscles in his back, down his sides, and between us, where his thick hardness pushes heavily against my thigh. I grasp it\u2014soft, hard, velvety\u2014and a low growl emanates from his throat. Lowering his head, he brushes his mouth across mine, tasting with his tongue and holding my jaw still with his hand. His kiss is . . . internal. Exploring. Soulful. I never want it to stop. . . .</p><p>He\u2019s wedging hips between my legs, his weight braced on one forearm. The firm peaks of my breasts brush his chest, and he shudders. Staring down, his eyes sadden. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t supposed to happen,\u201d he whispers, and kisses me. \u201cI\u2019m not . . . Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>My body is alive with more sensation than I can handle, and my mind won\u2019t process his words. Not now. All I want is feeling.</p><p>All I want is him. \u201cEli, please,\u201d I whisper.</p><p>With anxious fingertips, I trace his spine from his neck to his waist, counting each vertebra, lining each muscle as they tense under my touch. Slowly I lift my legs and pull my heels against his buttocks, hooking them around his hips.</p><p>I can feel his heart slam against his ribs, and I know he can take it no more.</p><p>Lowering his head, he takes my mouth as though savoring every inch of my lips, tasting with his tongue, and I kiss him back with desperate fervor. Skimming my hips, my stomach, he cups one breast and deepens the kiss, our tongues entwined, and the intensity of the dual contact makes his arousal push hard against me. Inside, my body is wrenching for release.</p><p>Again I arch and push against him, then grab his neck and pull his head down to my bare chest. He tastes the soft rise of my breast, dragging his mouth erotically over it, tasting the aroused peak. I think I\u2019ll lose my mind.</p> <p>My breath catches and I moan\u2014a soft whimper that doesn\u2019t even sound like me. I can\u2019t help it.</p><p>With a hard yank, I pull his head to my mouth, where I kiss him, sweeping my tongue across his bottom lip, then gently take it between my teeth. \u201cNow,\u201d I demand on a hoarse whisper. \u201cI want you now, Eli. Please.\u201d</p><p>We stare at each for the space of a second, eyes locked. This . . . figment of my imagination shifts his hips and fills me in one slow thrust. I moan out loud as my wet heat envelopes him, holds him, forces his eyes to close, and he shakes with aroused need.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Riley,\u201d he mutters against my throat as he starts to move inside me, reaching for a destination singularly his, the wild need to claim it growing with each powerful, primal thrust.</p><p>The mounting eruption within him grows at an uncontrollable speed and I can feel it, just as I feel my own, and he drives into me with furious passion.</p><p>My own savage response shocks me, and I desperately claw at him, matching his every move, pushing him over the edge until my name tears from his throat as he explodes inside me, over and over as he buries himself deep inside of me, his body seizing, shuddering.</p><p>My breath catches again and I hold him tightly as my own climax peaks and consumes, my feminine muscles contracting around him with each pulse of my orgasm. I bite his shoulder as its intensity heightens, little gasps escaping my lips; then slowly, with each breath, my body relaxes.</p><p>He rests his forehead against mine as our ragged breathing returns to normal. My arms go around him and pull him close. It\u2019s not right. I can\u2019t stop. Can\u2019t move away.</p><p>Pressing his lips to my damp temple, he smoothes back my hair; kisses me long, deep, taking his time to savor my mouth; then moves to my side and gathers me close. \u201cI am never far from you,\u201d he says softly. \u201cEven when you don\u2019t know I\u2019m there, I am. And don\u2019t forget about my invitation. I look forward to seeing you there. Alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRi, wake up,\u201d a voice calls to me. A hand caresses my cheek. \u201cRiley?\u201d</p><p>Slowly my eyelids drag open. I feel as though I\u2019ve been run over by a truck. I blink several times, and only after a few moments do I realize I\u2019m completely naked. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I say, then turn to the voice awakening me.</p><p>\u201cVic, what\u2019s going on?\u201d All I can now remember is the incredibly erotic dream I\u2019ve had. And especially the fact that I didn\u2019t think it was a dream at all. I thought it was freaking real. I thought it was Eli. Yet . . . now I\u2019m not so sure. I stare at the Romanian vampire. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t take my clothes off.\u201d I pull the sheets up to my chin.</p><p>Victorian Arcos, in the hazy light of my room, stares down at me with liquid brown eyes. And says nothing.</p><p>\u201cPoe, Jesus Christ, when are you gonna\u2014\u201d</p><p>Noah bursts into my room and abruptly stops when he sees Victorian. I know he doesn\u2019t like the Romanian and will probably never trust him as I do, but he tolerates him. To a certain degree. Noah turns to me, plops down on the bed, the mattress sinking under his weight and making me roll toward him. He thumps me on the forehead. \u201cHow long are you gonna sleep, woman? It\u2019s been almost twenty-four hours now.\u201d</p><p>I bolt up, barely remembering to take the sheet with me. The last thing I want to do is flash these two pervs. \u201cWhat? What the hell?\u201d I say. How could I have slept so long? \u201cMove, Noah. Actually, both of you get out of here. I need to dress. Without an audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Noah mumbles, and rises from the bed. \u201cJake said to let you sleep, that your body probably needed it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not wanting to wait another second for either of them, I crawl out of bed, dragging the sheets with me and around me, and walk over to the trunk where I have my clothes stashed. Lifting the lid, I grab a pair of panties, a black tank, and a navy pair of cargo pants. \u201cWhy did you listen to him?\u201d I answer, holding the sheets now with my chin and yanking up my panties. Dropping the sheets I turn around, back to the boys, and pull on my tank top. Turning again, I glare at Noah. \u201cI have a hard time believing you just . . . listened to him. You know I don\u2019t want to just . . . sleep!\u201d Grasping my cargoes, I step into them and pull them up. Only then do I notice the wide-eyed expression on Victorian\u2019s face and the ridiculous, pervy, wolfish grin on Noah\u2019s. \u201cGod almighty, you two.\u201d I shake my head, punch Noah in the arm as I walk by, and grab a clean pair of black footie socks from the chest. Pull them on, followed by my Nikes, and gather my hair into a ponytail. I head for the door. \u201cComing?\u201d I ask the two.</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d Noah says, then laughs at himself.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cJesus,\u201d I mutter, then head to the bathroom in the hall. Just as I reach the door, with Vic and Noah not far behind, I remember. Everything. That sexual dream. Is it just my conscience missing Eli?</p> <p>But the invitation. That was real.</p><p>The erotic dream and the invitation to the Marimae House are from the same person. And guilt claws at my gut about both. I wanted that dream to be of Eli. Not of some . . . stranger. What does that make me? In the dream, I was completely willing. A sick feeling washes over me, and the empty void left by Eli aches as though someone has jammed a knife into my heart.</p><p>I duck into the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth. I need to tell Jake about this . . . whoever he is.</p><p>And now.</p><p>Part Eight</p> <p>FALLING</p><p>The angels are so enamored of the language that is spoken in heaven that they will not distort their lips with the hissing and unmusical dialect of men, but speak their own, whether there be any who understand it or not.</p><p>\u2014Ralph Waldo Emerson</p><p>Riley looks calm, even at most times acts calm, but I can tell what lies just beneath the surface. A simmering, almost boiling fury that will unleash on anyone whom she finds responsible for her mate\u2019s death. No\u2019 that I blame her. But a storm is brewing, and she will be leading it. The Fallen will never know what hit them.</p><p>\u2014Darius</p><p>I find Jake and Gabriel upstairs in the dojo, working the swords. It\u2019s early\u2014seven a.m. Both are bare to the waist, hair pulled back, ferocious as hell. They look like they\u2019re trying to kill each other, hacking, swinging. Warriors. I stand quietly by, watching and admiring. It\u2019s odd to think that they both once swung those weapons as a means of survival so many centuries ago.</p> <p>\u201cAmazing, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Sydney says, suddenly beside me. I glance at her. Leaning, back to the wall, hands crossed over her chest, she stares at the pair on the mat with admiration gleaming in her blue eyes. She looks at me. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about Eli,\u201d she says, and admiration is replaced by sorrow. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine losing someone I loved like that.\u201d Her gaze immediately shoots to Gabriel. \u201cIt must be so painful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I answer, \u201cit is. I miss him every second.\u201d Sydney looks at me, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something in my voice or something else that causes her to. I continue. \u201cHe totally changed my life. And in my book, he\u2019s not dead. Something has happened to him, but he\u2019s not dead.\u201d</p><p>After she holds my stare for a moment, her gaze returns to Gabriel.</p><p>I\u2019m uncomfortable talking about Eli. It makes me realize he\u2019s not here for me right now. To talk to. To touch. I turn at every corner and think I\u2019ll see him, and I don\u2019t. I crave him. I know he hasn\u2019t been gone that long, but it feels like it. Just as it feels like he\u2019s been in my life forever. What really sucks is that finally, finally I trust someone with my heart . . . and I lose him. It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s just not fucking fair. And I\u2019m going to find him. Even if it kills me.</p><p>\u201cSo, what about you and Gabriel?\u201d I ask, wanting to quickly shift the conversation off of me and Eli. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you two?\u201d</p><p>Sydney gets a faraway look in her eyes before answering. \u201cI\u2019m the key to this whole thing, that\u2019s what\u2019s up,\u201d she says, and I hear remorse in her voice. \u201cWithout me, the Seiagh can\u2019t be found or destroyed. I was born to become the Archivist. To do this very thing we\u2019re doing now. To save mankind. Gabriel protects me.\u201d She looks at me. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>I stare at her for several seconds. My brows furrow. \u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>Sydney\u2019s cheeks actually turn pink. \u201cYeah. Bullshit it is.\u201d She gazes at Gabriel. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s a one-sided deal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Sydney\u2019s quiet for a minute, watching the two swordsmen. I join her, and, yeah, it\u2019s more than amazing. Jake and Gabriel are pretty equally matched when it comes to brawn. They\u2019re about the same height, too. Gabriel seems, though, to be more at ease, or as one, with his sword. As if he\u2019s been wielding it a lot longer. He probably has. The muscles and cords in his back bunch and tighten as he arcs his blade, and when it connects with Jake\u2019s, both men make a grunting, guttural sound that reminds me of a pair of Vikings fighting. Jake\u2019s biceps . . . ridiculous. Veins popping everywhere, despite them being void of blood.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never faltered with me,\u201d Sydney says. \u201cNot even once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I ask.</p><p>She shrugs. \u201cHe\u2019s never made a move on me. Never even showed me once that he, I don\u2019t know, wants me. Or even cares about me, Sydney Maspeth. It\u2019s like he\u2019s all business. Protect the Archivist. Blah, blah, blah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeanwhile, he sets your skin on fire,\u201d I add.</p><p>\u201cIs it that obvious?\u201d she asks sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cWhat? That he rocks your world? Yeah, girl, it is. To me anyway.\u201d I drape an arm over her shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your secret is safe with me. Although,\u201d I say, turning my attention back to the guys, \u201cyou may be way off on your assumption about Gabriel\u2019s feelings for you.\u201d</p><p>Sydney lets out such a long, lonesome sigh that I have to fight not to laugh. \u201cNot holding my breath, Poe.\u201d</p><p>I grin at her. \u201cYou sound like my brother. Besides. Wouldn\u2019t matter if you did. You\u2019re immortal, silly. Now,\u201d I say, inclining my head toward the rack of swords against the far wall of the dojo. \u201cWanna go at it?\u201d</p><p>Sydney lifts a brow. \u201cMight as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I answer, and we hug the walls of the dojo. \u201cI need to burn off some steam.\u201d</p><p>Sydney works my ass off good. She\u2019s strong as hell, and her training has paid off. She may not look it, but she can kick some serious tushy. I concentrate on my moves, everything that Tristan taught me. Where to put my weight before I swing, and how to thrust, jab, and hack. Sydney\u2019s face is pure business as she weighs me, studies my moves, and swings at my head. I\u2019m breaking a furious sweat by the time we call a stalemate.</p><p>\u201cImpressive,\u201d Jake says as he and Gabriel watch from the edge of the mat. \u201cI think I\u2019m in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re our boss,\u201d I say, catching my breath. \u201cSexual harassment. Ever hear of it?\u201d</p><p>Jake grins. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve improved,\u201d Gabriel says, sheathing his sword. \u201cDe Barre is a fair teacher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDe Barre is a kick-ass teacher,\u201d I correct, then nod. \u201cYou\u2019re not too shabby yourself.\u201d</p><p>Gabriel merely gives a slight nod of acknowledgment. One day I\u2019d love to see what his already-gorgeous face looks like in a full-blown smile. He really is something else. No wonder Sydney has fallen for him.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s eyes seek out Sydney, and I\u2019m looking at him the moment he spots her. Yeah. He\u2019s hiding it, all right, but that is one immortal otherbeing head over heels with Ms. Maspeth. All business, my ass. I can see it in his eyes. There\u2019s more to that hawklike, intense stare than just merely keeping the Archivist safe and sound.</p><p>I turn my attention to my employer. \u201cJake,\u201d I say, and incline my head. \u201cI need a word.\u201d</p><p>Jake sheaths his sword and swaggers across the dojo. The man towers over me and stares down at me with an unbendable look. \u201cAye?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been issued an invitation,\u201d I begin, meeting his gaze. When he doesn\u2019t say anything, I continue. \u201cBy someone who can speak to me inside my head. And apparently have sex with me in my head, too.\u201d I sigh. \u201cI thought it was Eli.\u201d</p><p>Jake raises a brow. From the corner of my eye I notice the rest of the WUP team entering the dojo.</p><p>\u201cNice of you to share info, Poe. Do you recognize this person?\u201d Jake asks.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I haven\u2019t seen his entire face.\u201d I leave out the part about the erotic sex dream that still brings me shame. \u201cI don\u2019t really know who he is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a man?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a male,\u201d I clarify. \u201cObviously an otherbeing, if he can speak to me in my head.\u201d</p><p>Jake nods. \u201cSo true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s all he did was give you an invite somewhere?\u201d Noah asks, walking up to stand beside me. \u201cOut of the blue?\u201d</p><p>I eye Noah. \u201cWatch that jealous tone, spud,\u201d I warn. \u201cAnd no. He seemed . . . familiar to me. And with me. Yet I\u2019m sure I never met him before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did he invite you to?\u201d asks Darius, joining in. His hair is loose about his shoulders, and he\u2019s pulling it back from his face as he speaks. He gathers it with a leather band and awaits my answer.</p><p>I look at him. \u201cSome event at the Marimae House. He says it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn New Town,\u201d finishes Gabriel. \u201cStill an old home. They host several charity events a year. Edinburgh\u2019s elite turns out, as well as many Londoners.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s lookin\u2019 for something,\u201d Jake says. Then gives a slight grin. \u201cBesides you, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d Ginger asks, and she comes to stand by Sydney. She\u2019s wearing head-to-toe black training gear.</p><p>\u201cMayhap another of us,\u201d Jake answers, meaning vampire. \u201cHe obviously either saw Riley or senses her presence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen he may sense our presence, as well,\u201d Victorian adds. \u201cRiley\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>I glance at Victorian, and his expression is dead serious.</p><p>\u201cRiley can handle herself,\u201d Jake says, and looks at me. \u201cAm I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are,\u201d I say without hesitating.</p><p>Jake nods. \u201cGood. Now, what exactly did he say to you?\u201d</p> <p>I shift my weight. \u201cHe wants me to meet him at the Marimae House at seven p.m.\u201d I have to think. \u201cSince I lost a day to sleeping, I guess that\u2019ll be tomorrow at seven p.m.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what else did he say?\u201d Noah prods.</p><p>\u201cWell, he did say to come alone.\u201d I look at Noah. \u201cAnd that he couldn\u2019t wait to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking creeper,\u201d Noah mumbles. \u201cYou\u2019re not going alone, Ri. Forget it. We don\u2019t know what he is.\u201d He gives Jake a challenging look.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right, Miles,\u201d Jake answers. \u201cShe won\u2019t be going alone.\u201d He turns and glances at Sydney and Ginger. \u201cThe other girls are going to join her.\u201d</p><p>Lucian gives a low growl. I think I\u2019m the only one, besides Ginger, who hears it. Ginger places a hand on her mate\u2019s arm and looks at Jake. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Sydney says. \u201cI can\u2019t stay cooped up in here one more day.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis a formal event,\u201d Gabriel says. \u201cWe\u2019ll have your attire ordered.\u201d</p><p>Jake glances at first Sydney, then Ginger. \u201cA four, a four.\u201d Then he looks at me. \u201cAnd an eight. In black.\u201d He grins at me.</p><p>Prick, I say to Jake in my head.</p><p>Tsk, tsk. I\u2019m your boss. Sexual harassment. Ever hear of it? he responds back.</p><p>I simply smile. I\u2019m flipping you the bird. Here. In my mind.</p><p>Jake laughs out loud.</p><p>It suddenly reminds me of Eli. The thought that there\u2019s a chance, no matter how slight, that Eli is . . . somewhere, and not dead, gives me strength. Courage. And lightens me. I feel energized.</p> <p>\u201cRight,\u201d Jake says, and turns to everyone. \u201cSince the Jod\u00eds move during the night and the Fallen are, as far as we know, down again to recover, we should spend the daylight hours training. So partner up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd tonight?\u201d asks Ginger.</p><p>Jake gives a slight grin. \u201cTonight we hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunt Jod\u00eds?\u201d asks Victorian. He slides a glance my way.</p><p>\u201cHunt . . . everything,\u201d Jake corrects. \u201cUnless Syd finds another clue.\u201d</p><p>For the rest of the day, we train. Swords. Hand-to-hand. Dirks. You name it. All the while, though, my thoughts remain on Eli. I see his face every time I blink. In my head, I even hear his voice. How can someone like Eligius Dupr\u00e9 come into my life, change it so drastically, then . . . leave? It doesn\u2019t seem real. I still expect him to walk around the corner any minute. Sometimes I glance up. Hoping. I even hear his voice in my head.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t happen.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I yelp, and jump back. My thoughts rush to the present, and my vision focuses on what\u2019s in front of me. Lifting my hand to my shoulder, I cover the trickle of blood caused by Jake\u2019s sword with my palm. I stare hard at him.</p><p>\u201cPay attention,\u201d he warns. \u201cYour mind has to be in this, Riley. It could mean your life.\u201d He inclines his head to the rest of the group. \u201cOr one of ours.\u201d</p><p>I wipe the sweat from my brow. \u201cYeah,\u201d I answer, frowning. \u201cGotcha.\u201d By now the sun has started to drop, and I need a little alone time. Maybe a short run before darkness totally falls. My pride is a little stung, having been chastised with the tip of a sword in front of the whole WUP team. I need to blow off a little steam.</p><p>Again. Seems I have a lot of that built up lately. But that\u2019s the way I handle things. I don\u2019t sit around and cry or mope. I run. Or kick the shit out of something. Usually my training bag at home. Since I don\u2019t have one of those here, I\u2019ll just run.</p><p>Replacing my sword in the rack, I slip out of the dojo as the others are sparring. Peter is in the kitchen doing . . . something. I hear plates and silverware clanking together. The Crescent\u2019s hall is shadowy and dark, the lights extinguished downstairs all except the one lamp in the foyer. I ease out the front door and into the cool, briny Edinburgh evening. The sun is not fully extinguished yet, so the sky is a myriad of purples and pinks. No sword to weigh me down, I\u2019ve only one dirk tucked into the inner belt of my black training pants. Wearing a long-sleeved black tee to cover up the dragons, I take off, leaping over the Crescent\u2019s black wrought-iron gates and onto Old Tolbooth Wynd. I\u2019ll be back before it\u2019s time to head out into the city.</p><p>At Canongate, I turn left and jog toward the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Behind the old palace is Holyrood Park, and from what Gabriel says, it\u2019s something like six hundred acres. The Salisbury Crags slope up to one of Edinburgh\u2019s landmarks, Arthur\u2019s Seat. Gabriel says it\u2019s a little over eight hundred feet high. That\u2019s a pretty sick steam blower, if you ask me.</p><p>So, that\u2019s where I\u2019ll head. Out of the city, and a place where, especially at this time of evening, I can wide-open run. No one to notice but the wildlife.</p><p>Jogging down Canongate, I pass the kirk where I found that poor girl the other night. Slain by a creature concocted from dark, ancient magic. I glance over and see a middle-aged couple and a younger boy, maybe fourteen, standing near the very place I found her. I slow to a walk. The woman has a small collection of wildflowers bunched in her hands, and she bends over, lays it on the ground, and turns to the man beside her and sobs. The boy looks . . . helpless, hands shoved in his pockets, and he glances around. His gaze catches mine. Yeah, kid. I know the feeling. I\u2019m sorry as hell you have to go through it.</p><p>The boy blinks and stares at me for several seconds, then leans into his father.</p><p>I continue on.</p><p>The streets are damp from the afternoon\u2019s rain shower, and the dark gray cobbles take on a slick shine in the haze of evening. There\u2019s still enough light to see, so I take it easy at first, keeping my pace to a leisurely, humanlike jog. The blast of a horn cuts through the air, followed by another. I dodge a store clerk locking up his business for the day. FISHMONGER, says the painted sign on the window. The man looks at me. \u201cAye, lass. Are ya headed up to the Seat, then?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I stop. \u201cYes, I am,\u201d I answer. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, a Yank. Here on holiday?\u201d he continues. He\u2019s short, with a bulbous red nose. The man obviously likes his whiskey.</p><p>I smile. \u201cRight again.\u201d</p><p>His eyes, crinkled at the corners, graze over the inked wings at mine. \u201cRight. Well you might want to bear right just up the way and take the Radical Road. \u2019Tis a rough track that\u2019ll take ya straight up to the Seat.\u201d</p><p>I give a nod. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he responds, and turns to finish locking up the door.</p><p>With a wave, I jog onward. At the end of the block I bear right, and sure enough, around the palace, which is pretty impressive, is a rough road. Radical Road. I take it and, after seeing no one around, open up.</p><p>Even at top speed I can\u2019t help but notice how wild yet gorgeous the landscape is. The grass is still green, even in October, and stretches out toward the sharp hill that juts up\u2014Arthur\u2019s Seat\u2014and the beauty of it takes me by surprise. I have to remember that just because there is evil invading Edinburgh doesn\u2019t mean the city itself is evil. It\u2019s . . . stunning. And I wish more than anything Eli could be here to see it with me. One day, again. Soon.</p><p>Before I know it, the sun is dropping fast, but I don\u2019t care. I can still see out, and I\u2019m determined to make it to the top of the Seat. A sweet aroma\u2014different from the city\u2019s brine\u2014hits my nose. Clover? Whatever it is, I like it. It soothes me. Pushes me harder. Soon I\u2019m at the foot of the Seat and I start the climb. It\u2019s not straight up, so I run at an angle, and at one point I\u2019m bent over, using hands and feet to gain the top. Sharp rock, spongy stuff that I can\u2019t identify, and clumps of faded brownish-purple bushes that I think are heather are all over. They\u2019re not soft to the touch. Neither are the thistles. I ignore all of that, though, and scrap my way over and up. As a full-fledged human it would\u2019ve taken me, I don\u2019t know, probably an hour or two to climb. Now? Let\u2019s just say I left the Crescent about fifteen minutes ago and I\u2019m nearly to the top. I notice how fast the sun drops out of site, and the purple-and-pink-streaked sky has become gray and dark. It\u2019s not pitch out yet, but it\u2019s getting there. I\u2019d better hurry or I\u2019ll miss the view.</p><p>In less than three minutes I\u2019m at the top. The city\u2019s lights are on now and the castle is illuminated, a guiding light in its gray center. Tall, dark spires that look like jagged shadows jut skyward. I can hear tires splash through puddles. Doors scraping the wood floor as they close. Grease sizzling as battered fish and whatever else is being fried. Conversations merge, and I have to block them all out because trying to decipher the different dialects and accents makes my head hurt. I breathe in, long, deep. That clover smell is potent up here, almost like someone\u2019s just cut the grass and run over a giant pile of, well, clover. And some other things I\u2019m not familiar with. Makes you think nothing could ever be as wrong as they are down in the city.</p><p>But they damn sure are.</p><p>Since going down has to be even easier than going up, I know I\u2019ll get back to the Crescent in minutes. Just as I start down, I jolt to a stop. A dead halt.</p><p>A lone figure stands twenty feet away. His face is cast in shadows, and I see nothing but his silhouette. My heart leaps.</p><p>\u201cEli?\u201d I say out loud. Jesus Christ, it looks just like him. At least I feel it does. His height, body shape, broad shoulders. Even the way he stands. I move slowly toward him. He\u2019s saying nothing, yet I feel . . . something. A familiar presence about him. \u201cEli, is that you?\u201d I know it sounds absurd that I even think it. I saw what happened to him at Waverly Station. There\u2019s no denying what happened. Yet . . . I still have doubt. Eli! If it\u2019s you, you\u2019d better goddamn answer me! </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I\u2019m almost to the figure now, and he\u2019s not moving. He\u2019s not speaking.</p><p>He\u2019s not breathing.</p><p>I hear no heartbeat.</p> <p>I freeze. Standing my ground, I do nothing but stare.</p><p>The image blurs, shifts, and disappears.</p><p>Blinking, I gape at the empty space. I rub my eyes with my knuckles and look again. I look around. I\u2019m on the Seat, totally alone.</p><p>And I must be losing my frickin\u2019 mind. Now I\u2019m seeing what I think is Eli? Shaking my head, I start down the Seat once more, and in a couple of seconds I\u2019m at a full run. I cross the park, leaving the path and going straight across the grassy field, and pass a small body of water. A loch. Maybe one day I can return and enjoy all of this to its fullest.</p><p>I circle the palace, and the second my feet hit the grounds of the ruined abbey, a body hurls from the shadows and knocks square into me. I go flying sideways and land under its weight. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I mutter, and with two hands easily shove the body off me. I jump to my feet. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I say to the kid pushing up off the ground where I threw him. From the shadows of the abbey, five more emerge. Six guys in all, and in this light I\u2019d say they\u2019re between the ages of eighteen and twenty-three. Youth. Probably punks.</p> <p>Shit.</p><p>I don\u2019t have time for this.</p><p>\u201cWhere ya goin\u2019, lass, in such a feckin\u2019 hurry?\u201d one says, and he steps closer to me. The others fall in behind him. One by one, they fan out. Circling me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you?\u201d another says. \u201cWe watched you run from the Seat. You ain\u2019t normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very normal,\u201d I say. \u201cNow move. I\u2019ve got somewhere to go.\u201d</p><p>One bold one takes a few steps up and pushes me backward. \u201cYou ain\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere, miss.\u201d He cocks his head, his face half in shadows. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the ink?\u201d he reaches out and tries to touch my cheek.</p> <p>Bad move.</p><p>I grab his arm and in a second have it twisted up and behind him. The others loom toward me, and I yank his arm higher. He curses and yells. \u201cYou\u2019re feckin\u2019 breakin\u2019 my arm, bitch!\u201d</p><p>I tug a few more times, and he yelps. \u201cNo,\u201d I say, in his ear, calculating. \u201cYou\u2019ve still got a little more give before the bone snaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGe\u2019 off me!\u201d he yells, his accent heavy.</p><p>The others advance. And without hesitation.</p><p>I look at the one in the lead. Fall to your knees.</p><p>He does with a yell. \u201cFeck!\u201d</p><p>The next one\u2019s already looking at me. Down on your side, grab your balls, and scream like a girl.</p> <p>He does, but the screaming is so annoying and loud that I put a stop to it. Scream silently.</p><p>His mouth is wide open but nothing\u2019s coming out. Perfect.</p><p>The rest, all wearing dingy clothes and T-shirts with jackets, fall in the same manner. Squirming on the ground in silence. I walk the one standing, my hand still jacking his arm up behind him, toward the ruined abbey wall. I look up and notice the darkened sky peeking through what once was a grand window but now is a gaping mouth in stone. I shove the kid against the wall, face into stone. \u201cDo you seriously not have anything better to do than jump, or try to jump, women in the park? Really?\u201d I shove him harder, and he grunts. His hair is cut close, or I\u2019d grab a handful of it and yank him hard. \u201cStop being a useless piece of shit for society and go do something. Get a job. Whatever.\u201d I lean close, my mouth to his ear. \u201cBut be careful who you fuck with.\u201d</p><p>I give him one last push into the stone wall. He grunts again.</p><p>Now drop to your knees, be quiet, and don\u2019t turn around for five minutes.</p><p>I let him go and he drops to his knees.</p><p>With a glance at the rest, I shake my head and take off back to Canongate, wondering the whole time not who that group of punk guys could\u2019ve potentially raped or beaten if I weren\u2019t there, but what exactly I saw on top of the Seat.</p><p>And why I thought it was Eli.</p><p>The streets are dark now, lamps burning and shining on the wet cobbles, and people are hustling about. The wind has picked up and it\u2019s brisk against my cheeks. I barely make it to Old Tolbooth Wynd before I almost run smack into Noah. His face is glowering, almost illuminated, in the lamplight.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cLose the \u2019tude, Miles. Jesus. I went for a run,\u201d I answer.</p><p>\u201cAlone? Without telling anyone? Seriously?\u201d he says angrily. \u201cGoddamn, Riley. Use your head.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him, bewildered. \u201cI like the old Noah better. You know, the one who eggs me on at a vampire fight club?\u201d I frown. \u201cWhere\u2019s that guy?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes soften in the lamplight as his gaze locks onto mine. \u201cHe left the minute Dupr\u00e9 did.\u201d Sun-streaked dreadlocks shift over his shoulder as he shakes his head. \u201cEli made me vow to watch over you if anything ever happened to him. And I take my vows seriously, Ri.\u201d</p><p>We start walking up the wynd and toward the Crescent. I glance at Noah. \u201cWell . . . thank you. I appreciate it. But I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandle yourself. Yeah, I know.\u201d He grins. \u201cEli said you\u2019d say that. A while back, in Savannah. Before we left.\u201d</p><p>I smile again. \u201cYeah, he would.\u201d Inside, though, my heart is ripping just thinking of him. \u201cNoah, up on the hill back there. I . . . thought I saw him.\u201d I look at him. \u201cEli.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s face hardens. \u201cWho was it?\u201d</p><p>I kind of laugh and shake my head. \u201cThat\u2019s just it. It was . . . no one, I guess.\u201d My gaze meets his. \u201cHe . . . blurred, faded, and disappeared. No one else was around except, well, that was later, by the abbey.\u201d</p><p>Noah grabs my arm and we both jerk to a halt. \u201cWhat happened at the abbey?\u201d</p><p>I snatch my arm back. \u201cListen, vow or not, you can\u2019t be Mr. Overprotective all the time. Good Lord.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cHumans. Kids. Punk kids. I took care of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cSix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Riley,\u201d he mutters. We get to the gates, and the others are already waiting. \u201cWhat\u2019d you do to them?\u201d</p><p>I shrug. \u201cNothing much.\u201d I smile. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve found your way home again,\u201d Jake says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hunt in sections, teams of three. Miles, Gabriel, and Sydney. Darius, you\u2019re with the lupines. Arcos, Riley, and myself. Keep to the shadows. It\u2019s what they prefer. Royal Mile upward way, the castle gardens below, the clubs on Niddry Street, around the kirk yards. My group will take first Tron Kirk, St. Giles\u2019, and Greyfriars, and the university. And any close or wynd in between. Darius, your group takes Niddry Street. Gabriel, castle gardens, Scotts Monument, Waverly.\u201d</p><p>Noah gives me a furtive look. I hate not being beside you. Fucking hate it. Be careful, and don\u2019t do anything stupid. Got it?</p><p>Yeah, I got it, Mr. Grumpypants. Keep your mind in the game. Sydney, above all else, needs her back watched. It\u2019s why you\u2019re with them tonight. I told Jake what a kick-ass fighter you are. And don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be safe. Pinky promise. I smile and nod, despite the scowl he gives me, and join my team.</p><p>Through the darkness, old Peter comes hurrying toward me across the Crescent\u2019s drive. \u201cHere ya go, miss,\u201d he says in his heavy accent, making go sound like goo. Ya canna forget these now. Can ya?\u201d He hands me my coat and sword.</p><p>I grin and take them. \u201cThanks, Peter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he answers, bobbing his gray, cap-covered head. \u201cBe safe now, the lot of ya.\u201d</p><p>I pull my arm through the leather strap, buckle it at the waist, and sheath the sword. Victorian helps me into my coat.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re in pain over your man,\u201d Victorian says close to my ear. \u201cBut even I agree with Miles. Get your head in the game, Riley.\u201d He turns me around and looks me in the eye. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to see you harmed. In any way.\u201d His gaze deepens. \u201cI won\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him. \u201cOkay, okay, Vic. Chill. I promise. I will be careful.\u201d</p><p>He continues to study me, as if he doesn\u2019t believe a word of it.</p><p>With good reason.</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go,\u201d Jake calls. We all disperse.</p><p>We immediately cross over to Cowgate and head toward George IV Bridge. There are a few caf\u00e9s still open, a bakery, and a few chip shops. Several restaurants. Traffic on the streets has slowed, almost as much as foot traffic has on the sidewalks. We reach Candlemaker\u2019s Row and head toward Greyfriars. We slip into the shadows, hug walls, and keep a critical eye\u2014and nose\u2014out for Jod\u00eds. I see and smell nothing unusual. We move in and out of alleyways, behind businesses, and into any small, shadowy place evil would lurk. Nothing. Finally, at Greyfriars, a guided ghost tour is just leaving the kirk yard as we pass. The guide, a big guy with a head full of dark hair and a black cloak, stares hard at us, but continues on with his group.</p><p>Inside the kirk yard, we separate and slip around the many stone crypts and headstones filling the ancient hallowed yard. The cemetery is neatly manicured, with paved pathways among green grass. Ahead I hear something. A heartbeat. Alone. I back into the shadows and wait. Soon a young woman appears on the path coming in through the front gates of Greyfriars. Why she\u2019s alone, I have no idea. It\u2019s well after nine p.m. She must\u2019ve slipped away from the tour group. She\u2019s dressed in a black peacoat, with her hair all tucked up beneath a cream-colored knitted cap. She has her hands stuffed into her pockets and is walking fast. So fast, she walks right past me without noticing. I follow.</p><p>Where are you? Victorian calls to me inside my head.</p><p>I don\u2019t know. By a crypt. There\u2019s someone in here. Human. She seems to know where she\u2019s going. I answer.</p><p>And where\u2019s that? Vic asks.</p><p>Then the smell hits me. Stronger than usual. That means there\u2019s more than just one.</p><p>Jod\u00eds, Jake, Vic. Get over here. I can smell them. I\u2019m near a wall of graves. So gray, some almost look black. And there\u2019s a woman in here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No way in freaking Hell is another Jod\u00eds going to kill an innocent with me this close by. I hurry behind her, my eyes darting in the dark. No Jod\u00eds yet. Hopefully, we\u2019re here in time. I ease back into the shadows as I follow her. I don\u2019t want to scare her and I don\u2019t want the Jod\u00eds to see me. Not yet anyway.</p><p>Then I see them. Rather, their shadows. Shit, and no sign of Vic and Jake. Where the hell are you guys?</p><p>No answer.</p> <p>So I handle things alone. My way.</p><p>I look at the woman\u2019s retreating back. Turn back around and run. Back to the front gates and into the first open establishment you see. Or rejoin your tour group. Do it now.</p><p>The woman turns right around and starts hauling ass up the paved walkway.</p><p>That immediately draws the Jod\u00eds out.</p><p>As soon as the human runs past me, I draw my blade and step out into the path. It\u2019s dark as shit in this place, and only a faraway glow from a nearby yard lamp shines in my direction. I\u2019m just outside the arc of light. I turn to the Jod\u00eds and watch four of them emerge from the shadows.</p> <p>Shit.</p><p>You in the front. Drop to the ground.</p><p>Nothing. Nothing at all happens. Except they all begin to hiss like fucking Sleestaks from Land of the Lost and edge closer. Three begin to circle around me. Guess they\u2019re creations of magic, and my quadruple-vampiric mind wizardry just doesn\u2019t work on them.</p><p>Double shit.</p><p>That means I\u2019ll just have to hack off their ugly heads.</p><p>Quickly, I shrug out of this suffocating long cloak and kick it out of the way. Not so restricted, I can move better now, and I face the first Jod\u00eds advancing on me. They\u2019re tall, gray, and leathery, with exaggerated mouths that don\u2019t close all the way. And they stink like a rotting hog carcass. Yes, unfortunately I know what that smells like. You\u2019d think a creature of magic could possibly be more . . . becoming. Not the Jod\u00eds.</p> <p>The one in front of me lunges, and I crouch, roll, and jump up behind him, my sword raised. With a heavy swing, I take his head. Off. It rolls on the paved walkway and into the grass, where it turns into white mush. The screaming starts, the white gross liquid stuff the Jod\u00eds turns into begins, and I\u2019m facing the next one. Where the Hell did Vic and Jake go?</p><p>Scratch that. Two more facing me, one circling behind me. Hissing. Their mouths open and hissing. Long, spindly fingers with ragged claws reach for me, and the only thing I can think to do is knock one down and hack at the other one. I do just that. With one leap I bound off the chest of the one facing me, swing midair at the other\u2019s head and connect. The head rolls, and I land in a crouch. The one I knocked down is already up again, advancing.</p><p>I\u2019m grabbed from behind. A cold, leathery grasp around my throat. It literally lifts me off the ground. The other two are advancing still, and I slam the tip of my sword down and into the top of the foot of the one holding me. It screams but doesn\u2019t let go.</p><p>Then a crack of glass, the lamplight extinguishes, and darkness falls upon the whole cemetery. I see nothing. The grip tightens around my throat and I choke, and with my elbow I slam into the ribs of the Jod\u00eds. Lightning fast, over and over, I hit it, but still it holds me.</p><p>Then wings. Dozens of beating wings. I can\u2019t see them, only hear them, and they\u2019re overhead and furious. So close now I can feel the air stirring against my skin. A shrieking noise, more wings, and a turbulent wind picks up. I\u2019m dropped. Rolling, I find my footing and spring up, stay low, and peer into the darkness. It looks as though a cloud of shadow swirls through the cemetery, and the cries of the Jod\u00eds fill the night air. Then, just as swiftly as they arrived, they cease. Silence fills Greyfriars. The Jod\u00eds are no more.</p><p>Question is, Who killed them?</p><p>I told you I would watch after you, Riley. No matter that you were left to defend yourself alone. I might not be physically there to help you, but I\u2019m always here. I look forward to tomorrow evening. Until . . .</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jake says suddenly, running up the paved walkway. Victorian is just behind him. Both look as bewildered as I feel. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d</p> <p>Confusion webs my brain and I give Jake a puzzled look. \u201cWhere\u2019d I go? Where did you two go? I called you both and neither answered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d they both answered at once.</p><p>\u201cYou said you had followed some human out of Greyfriars gates and onto Niddry Street, into a club,\u201d Jake says.</p><p>\u201cWhen we couldn\u2019t find you inside, Noah and the lupines went to fight a few Jod\u00eds just up the block. We went there to help, thinking you were there, too.\u201d</p><p>I am completely perplexed. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said,\u201d I tell them. \u201cI said to come here.\u201d</p><p>Both shook their head. I nod. \u201cWell, then, the Fallen have one up on us.\u201d I look at Jake. \u201cThey\u2019ve figured out how to manipulate us without even being physically here. They told you to go to a different location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jake asks, looking around me at the bubbling piles of Jod\u00eds goo.</p><p>\u201cI sent the human out,\u201d I say, and that sounds funny to my ears, as if I\u2019m not still human. \u201cAnd I stayed behind to fight off the Jod\u00eds. I got two out of four.\u201d</p><p>Jake looks around. \u201cWhere\u2019d the other ones go?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cI heard the wings overhead again, and the light went out.\u201d I point to the yard light in the corner that is still extinguished. \u201cAnd next thing I know, the one holding my throat lets me go, and . . . something kills them all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Jake says. \u201cWhy would any of the Fallen send aid to you?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly,\u201d I answer. \u201cIt was that voice, though. The one who gave me the invite. I recognize it.\u201d I look at Jake. \u201cHe says he won\u2019t let anything happen to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Victorian says, staring me down. It\u2019s dark, but I can vaguely see his silhouette. I know those liquid brown eyes are shooting daggers at me for being careless. \u201cThere won\u2019t be any more splitting up. From now on, I don\u2019t budge from your side.\u201d</p><p>Just then, a church bell tolls eleven.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hit the other side of Old Town,\u201d Jake says. \u201cWe\u2019ll hunt until dawn.\u201d</p><p>And we do.</p><p>We slip through every nook and cranny of Old Edinburgh, through the closes and wynds, in between ancient establishments and even inside a few. There\u2019s a small slice of time when the city is still; no black cabs, no trucks, no merchants, and no tourists. That time is now, and it\u2019s about an hour before the day breaks. Out in the Firth, seals bark, and the breaking of surf against rock invades my senses. A mist rolls in, sweeping through the aged stone and embracing the spires and architecture that make up Old Town Edinburgh. That white vapor slips through and wraps its long, spindly fingers around every surface, every rock, stone, mailbox, and parked car. It even weaves around my ankles.</p><p>We\u2019re all in Niddry\u2019s Pub, not on Niddry Street but a pub just the same, and the owner knows Gabriel and Sydney well enough to give them a key. We\u2019re at a large table in the corner, lights turned low, and I\u2019m sipping a dark lager.</p><p>\u201cA total of seven Jod\u00eds were killed tonight,\u201d Jake says. \u201cI don\u2019t think one innocent soul was lost this eve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo of those were killed, courtesy of the Fallen,\u201d Darius says. \u201cI dunno about you, but I think Riley has an admirer,\u201d he says, and looks at me. \u201cOne of the Fallen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame one who gave her the invite to tonight\u2019s charity,\u201d Noah says. \u201cI\u2019d bet a bag of fresh blood on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see tonight,\u201d Jake says. He looks at me. \u201cAnd if you think for a second you girls will be there alone . . .\u201d He gives me a slow grin. \u201cThen you just don\u2019t know us very well.\u201d</p><p>I pull long on my lager, looking at Jake over the bottle bottom. I finish and grin back. \u201cYeah, I know that. Kinda used to it by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be,\u201d Noah says beside me. His stare is a little more profound than usual. \u201cAnd don\u2019t think to get un-used to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of you,\u201d Lucian says, pointedly to his mate, Ginger.</p><p>My gaze immediately goes to Gabriel.</p><p>His immediately goes to Sydney.</p><p>But he says nothing.</p><p>Chickenshit.</p><p>I\u2019ve got half a mind to use my control and force him to tell her how he really feels.</p><p>Gabriel\u2019s gaze turns directly to me. And stays. For several seconds.</p><p>Point taken.</p><p>I smile.</p><p>Just as darkness wanes, and the light takes over, we file out of Niddry\u2019s and head to the Crescent. In a mansion full of vampires, werewolves, and immortal druids, I\u2019m the only one who has to have real sleep.</p><p>There\u2019s still a lot of work left to be done. Darius, Gabriel, and Sydney scour the history books, old tomes passed on from one clan of people to the next, in search of battles fought according to the inscription of the first relic. While they do that, I crash.</p><p>Hopefully not for twenty-four hours.</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m ever so glad to see you all safe and sound,\u201d Peter says, greeting us at the gates. It\u2019s early morning, mist is sweeping our ankles, and old Peter is wearing his tweed cap, dungarees, and a woolen coat. His nose is bright red, and his eyes twinkle with genuine happiness. What a cute old guy.</p><p>\u201cYeah, we\u2019re pretty happy about it, too,\u201d I say, and smile at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you care for a full Scottish breakfast, lass?\u201d he asks me, then looks over the other members. \u201cAnyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, I\u2019m for it,\u201d Ginger says.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Lucian, Gabriel, and Sydney all chime in.</p><p>\u201cExcellent! It shall be ready posthaste!\u201d he says, then bustles off to the main entrance.</p><p>\u201cWalk with me while I have a V8?\u201d Noah asks, knocking me in the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cRiley, a word before you go to sleep?\u201d Victorian interrupts.</p><p>I smile. \u201cSure. I\u2019ll call ya.\u201d</p><p>He nods and heads inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I give Noah a sidelong look. \u201cAre you clinging to me just to piss Vic off?\u201d</p><p>Noah almost chokes. \u201cClinging? And no. Make that hell, no.\u201d</p><p>I grin. \u201cOkay, then. Just for a sec. I\u2019m beat.\u201d</p> <p>His mercury eyes study me far longer than necessary. \u201cSomething\u2019s up with you,\u201d he says. \u201cYou never used to sleep so much. And what about the ear ringing? Is it better or do you need to see the doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better, I guess. Still there but not so intense. Probably just a head cold brewing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try,\u201d he says.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I have no idea. I was just thinking it myself.\u201d I look at him. \u201cMaybe because I\u2019ve gone from slightly eccentric yet full-blown human, despite what others might say, to human with tendencies. Maybe it\u2019s all . . . catching up to me.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. But, damn, when I fall out, I\u2019m out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d He opens the door for me, and I walk through. He follows, we cross the foyer, and he pulls me aside, into the sitting room just off the main entrance. Only a slight light shines through a crack in the drapes not yet pulled for the day. His stare finds mine and holds it. His body is close, and he brushes loose hair back from my face. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous, Ri. Too dangerous for you to be alone. Ever.\u201d</p> <p>I let my head fall back and I close my eyes. \u201cNoah. For God\u2019s sake.\u201d I lift my head back into position and look up at him. \u201cWhat is so freaking big-deal special about my safety? Not that I don\u2019t value my own life, but . . . damn. Everyone is so worried about keeping me safe.\u201d I grab his hand and squeeze it. \u201cNone of us are impervious to death here. Even the immortals can die. All of our safety is at risk, not just mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you\u2019re the only one here I vowed to keep safe,\u201d he threads his fingers through mine and squeezes hard. \u201cAnd I keep my goddamn vows.\u201d</p><p>Lifting his hand, Noah scrapes the pad of his thumb over my lip. \u201cI keep them, Riley Poe. You\u2019re important to me.\u201d</p><p>The sincerity in his unusual eyes gleams true, even in the haze of an early-morning, nearly darkened room. Emotions come from nowhere within me, and I suddenly feel so vulnerable, so . . . weak. I miss being embraced, being cherished. I know it sounds ridiculous, but . . . I can\u2019t help it. I lost someone I loved with all of my heart. And it was a helluva long struggle to give that hard heart of mine away.</p><p>Noah\u2019s eyes soften. \u201cYour heart is far from hard, woman.\u201d He brushes my cheek. \u201cNever has been.\u201d</p><p>Out of nowhere, I get the hugest sensation to just . . . fall into Noah\u2019s embrace. But I don\u2019t. Instead I squeeze his hand and smile. \u201cSure it has. I promise to be careful. You have my permission to watch over me mercilessly.\u201d I start out of the sitting room and look over my shoulder. \u201cSee ya in a few.\u201d</p> <p>Mercury eyes stare silently at me as I leave.</p><p>I\u2019m halfway up the stairs when Victorian is suddenly at my side. \u201cYou didn\u2019t call me.\u201d</p><p>I jump on the step. \u201cJesus!\u201d I look at him and elbow him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014I forgot. Don\u2019t do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust Miles,\u201d Vic blurts out. We hit the platform on the second floor and start up the corridor. \u201cI don\u2019t like him, either.\u201d</p><p>I laugh. \u201cWell, trust me, the feeling\u2019s mutual.\u201d I look at him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you trust him? You mean with me?\u201d</p><p>Victorian nods, and walks with his hands behind his back. \u201cNow that your man is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may think the same of you,\u201d I say. Truthfully, I\u2019ve always felt a reaction from Noah. I just brushed it off as powerful vampire sexuality. Maybe I was wrong.</p><p>\u201cHe has good reason to,\u201d Victorian answers bluntly, and stops at my door. \u201cI know you mourn your man,\u201d he says, looking down at me with those dark brown eyes. \u201cAnd I know you ache to be held, to be comforted,\u201d he says, and lifts my hand and kisses it. \u201cI am here for you, love. If ever you want me.\u201d</p> <p>I blink. \u201cNot much for beating around the bush. Are you, Vic?\u201d</p><p>He gives me a slight grin. \u201cI suppose not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I step around him and open my door. Over my shoulder, I look at him. \u201cI appreciate the offer,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be the first to know if ever I want to take you up on it. Good night.\u201d</p><p>I shut the door, but not before I see a huge, ridiculous grin spread across his handsome face.</p><p>Good Lord.</p><p>\u201cI will win you over one day,\u201d Victorian mutters in Romanian on the other side of the door.</p><p>\u201cI know what you just said,\u201d I say back in Romanian.</p><p>Vic swears and leaves the hall.</p><p>Finally, my bed.</p><p>I peel out of my clothes, kick them onto the floor in a pile, and crawl into bed with only my bra and panties. Within seconds, I\u2019m asleep.</p><p>At least before the dreams plague me again.</p><p>Part Nine</p><p>HEAVEN AND HELL</p><p>It was night, and the rain fell; and falling, it was rain, but, having fallen, it was blood.</p><p>\u2014Edgar Allan Poe, \u201cSilence\u2014A Fable\u201d</p><p>I see the pain in Riley\u2019s eyes, and I feel so sorry for her. To have lost her mate, Eli, and in the manner in which she lost him . . . it\u2019s unbearable to think of it. But, damn, she\u2019s a fighter. She hides her anguish well, and puts the team and innocent lives over her own pain. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. To be frank, I\u2019m glad to be on her side. She hasn\u2019t exactly warmed up to me yet, but she will. I hope.</p><p>\u2014Ginger Slater</p><p>I\u2019m in a place so deep, so dark, and so heavy, it takes all of my effort to breathe. I\u2019m not sure what it is\u2014whether it\u2019s the place itself or my company. I thought I was alone. I thought I was in my bed.</p><p>I\u2019m definitely not.</p><p>In an instant, a slight haze filters through the clouds, and it barely illuminates my surroundings. I\u2019m at a lake? Some body of water. I glance down. I\u2019m wearing nothing more than my bra and panties. It\u2019s October, yet I\u2019m warm. Not cold at all. Actually, it feels like a summer\u2019s day back home in Savannah.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d never wake up.\u201d</p><p>I jump, startled, and turn to see who has crept up on me. Familiar, yet I don\u2019t recognize the silhouette. Male. Tall. Broad shoulders. Long hair pulled back. Muscular. The slight haze of the moon doesn\u2019t give me access to his features. His accent, though, is . . . unique. Appealing.</p><p>I almost can\u2019t help but be attracted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m . . . sorry. I just couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d he says, and steps closer to me. I allow it, and I don\u2019t know why. Again, I can\u2019t seem to help myself. Butterflies stir inside of me, and I take a deep breath to try and dissipate the feeling. It doesn\u2019t work.</p><p>He\u2014I have no idea who he is or what his name is, and, for some reason, I don\u2019t even ask\u2014stops a breath away from me. With that hazy moonlight behind him, I can\u2019t see his face. I just know the allure he has hits me in a place I\u2019m not used to being hit. Only Eli gets me there. I think this is Eli. But is it? I feel him. Sense him. Yet . . . he\u2019s different. I\u2019m confused as hell. Again a deep breath. Again it doesn\u2019t work. Useless.</p><p>Next his large hands grasp my jaw on either side and his lips brush against mine in a whisper. \u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you, Riley,\u201d he says, and uses the slightest pressure to urge my mouth open. He angles his head and presses into me, taking in a long breath as he kisses me.</p><p>My own breath hitches and I drown in the slow, erotic brush of his lips, shoving my fingers through hair that feels like heavy silk, and taste him back.</p><p>His hands graze my sides, then move upward and cup my breasts through my bra. Quickly, he unsnaps the front clasp and pushes the silky material from my shoulders. It drops to the ground below. With callused hands, he caresses me, and my eyes close from the feel of it. His mouth claims mine, and the warmth from his hands against my breasts makes me sink into him, but he makes no further moves\u2014only deep, possessive kissing.</p><p>Then he stops.</p><p>Resting his forehead against mine, he slides his hands around my back and pulls me close. Why do I want him so badly? Who is he? Why is he so familiar? And why am I so out of control right now?</p><p>I push his hair aside and move my mouth to his ear, brushing the lobe with my tongue. When he shivers, I whisper, \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me, Eli. Not yet. I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>He stills, pulls back, and looks at me. I can\u2019t see his eyes, only a dark glare, but I know he\u2019s studying me. Contemplating. Wondering what the hell I\u2019m doing.</p><p>\u201cI . . . Jesus, I need you, Eli. So much it hurts,\u201d I say, my voice a broken whisper.</p><p>Without another word, he does as I ask.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? I . . . don\u2019t think I can stop if I start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I whisper, my breath ragged. \u201cI won\u2019t want you to stop.\u201d</p><p>He then lifts me in his arms and begins to walk toward the water. \u201cI can smell you\u2014almost taste you, so potent are your needs.\u201d He keeps moving, his long fall of silk hair brushing my bare shoulder, making me shiver. He lowers his head and sniffs my neck, an animal on the prowl. \u201cI have dreamed of tasting you fully, of feeling you explode against my tongue. Never did I think you would have me . . . like this.\u201d He sets me on my feet, and the warm water rides up to my waist. He circles behind me and stops, his head bent close to my ear, his whisper a deep purr, yet still not touching, sending vibrations of pleasure across my wet skin. \u201cI\u2019m going to bury myself deep inside of your tight wetness, feel your woman muscles grip my hard length as you take all of me in,\u201d he says as he licks my lobe, his warm breath caressing my cheek. \u201cBut first,\u201d he says, his raspy words vibrating against my throat, making me shiver with excitement, \u201cI\u2019m going to make you lose control right where you stand.\u201d</p><p>Every nerve ending in my body hums with power, ready to unleash the energy simmering in my veins. So erotic are his words, his voice, his promise, that damned sexy accent, I have to clench my muscles to keep from coming right then. I reach for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me. Just feel.\u201d</p><p>He moves behind me again and brushes my hair to the side. His mouth hovers over my skin, his warm breath coming in light puffs, and then the wet velvet of his tongue strokes me where his breath has just been. He trails my spine with his fingertips, making small circles against each vertebra, and I clench my fists, aching to touch him, but I manage control and keep them by my side. Heated liquid pools between my legs, making me pulsate with desire. \u201cPlease, Eli . . .\u201d</p><p>Finally, he touches me. His wet hands skim my sides, down my ribs, over my hips. Hooking my panties with his thumbs, he slides them down and I step out of them. He reaches down, grabs them, and throws them to the shore.</p> <p>\u201cChrist, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he whispers close to my ear, sending another wave of shivers through my taut body. Slowly he kisses me again, and it\u2019s so painfully slow and erotic that I nearly explode right there. Again I don\u2019t. But I can\u2019t control the moan of pleasure that escapes me.</p><p>I don\u2019t miss his sharp intake of air.</p><p>I don\u2019t know how much more I can take.</p><p>I want it to go on forever.</p><p>His large hands close over my breasts as his mouth claims that portion where my neck meets my shoulder. His thumbs brush the hardened, sensitive tips, and my head drops back to rest against his chest.</p> <p>He moves his leg between mine. \u201cSettle back against me.\u201d</p><p>I do, and the full erection pressing into the small of my back makes me moan again.</p><p>He kisses my jaw, then moves his mouth to my ear. \u201cI want to see how ready you are for me, love. Can you stand it?\u201d</p><p>Between breaths, I shiver and whisper, \u201cCan you?\u201d</p><p>A low growl rumbles deep in his throat. \u201cBe very still.\u201d</p><p>Keeping one hand possessively cupped over my breast, he slides his other hand over one hip, over the flat of my stomach, then farther, closer.</p> <p>The moment he touches me, an uncontrolled growl tears from my own throat.</p><p>\u201cChrist, woman,\u201d he says, holding his hand still against my wetness. His whisper turns hoarse. \u201cNow.\u201d He dips inside of me with one finger, holding me tightly against him. I suck in a raw breath and hold it, squeezing my eyes shut, fighting not to explode against his hand.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t work.</p><p>A gradual climax, one pulse at a time, increases with each beat, with each movement of his hand against me, until I turn my face against his shoulder, taking his flesh between my teeth as the orgasm claims me. Slowly it subsides.</p><p>With his arms encircling me, he walks me forward, the flesh between my thighs still quivering from pleasure.</p><p>I tread water and welcome its tepid temperature to somewhat cool the fire he has caused within me. Yet . . . I\u2019m somehow not satisfied. I hadn\u2019t wanted to explode, but, damn it, I couldn\u2019t help it. I wanted it to go on forever.</p><p>Bathed in the milky glow of the moon, this enigmatic male, Eli, stands tall, thick, muscular, and powerful. Volts of energy shimmer off his body in sizzling waves. His hair, silver from the moonlight, hangs loose to his waist, making him look wild, untamed, and I easily drum up a vision of him standing on a craggy Scottish sea cliff, a bolt of plaid draped over one shoulder, sword strapped to his side, a fierce wind whipping his hair. The beauty of it sucks the air from my lungs. And I have no idea where that vision comes from. Eli isn\u2019t Scottish. And he\u2019s not a Celt.</p><p>He releases me for a moment, ducks under the water, swims a ways off, and rises, hair soaked and dripping down his chest. He holds out an arm.</p> <p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I swim to him, eyes locked, something more than lust propelling me. Inexplicable. I push it to the far corners of my brain and just . . . accept.</p><p>We both tread water as we meet. \u201cLook at me,\u201d he says.</p><p>I do. I still can\u2019t see his face. Not completely anyway.</p><p>\u201cI can only offer you this moment,\u201d he says. Regret underlines his words.</p><p>I draw in a deep breath. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Eli,\u201d I whisper. \u201cWe\u2019re engaged. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on to my shoulders,\u201d he whispers.</p><p>Hard, thick muscles jump under my fingertips as I hold on. With one hand under the water, he pulls me against him, his fingers digging into my lower back. His thick arousal crushes against my belly. My throat tightens.</p><p>With the pad of his thumb, he traces my lips, hooking the corner, then lowering his mouth to mine, urging it open. Our tongues meet, slow, exploring at first, and then he breaks the kiss, angles my head, and moves his mouth over my throat. Sensations ripple through me, the brackish water lapping between us, mixed with his unique taste settling on my tongue, making me crave more.</p><p>He gives it.</p><p>Treading me backward, his eyes, still two dark orbs not fully visible, lock with mine and he turns, lifts me around his waist. Biceps muscles flex. \u201cHold on to me, love. Lock your legs around my waist.\u201d</p><p>As my legs encircle him, he slides into my slick wetness with one swift push, burying himself. I gasp, moaning as my feminine muscles stretch and accommodate the invasion. I almost come again.</p><p>\u201cPut your arms around my neck,\u201d he commands.</p><p>When I do, his mouth claims mine, devours me, his tongue tasting every corner. He moves his hips, pulling himself almost all the way out, then thrusting back in. His motions mimic his tongue, both making love, and I hook my ankles around his waist and move with him.</p><p>He thrusts faster, once, twice, a third time, and I close my eyes as jabs of heat flash across my skin and light erupts behind my eyes. And then as waves of powerful orgasm break over me, the feminine muscles contract, pulse, and squeeze in an unstoppable rush. A moan rips from my throat on a ragged breath.</p><p>His body jerks as his own climax convulses him, the muscles in his stomach flexing with each thrust, the vein in his neck thick, the columns of his neck prominent. His movements slow, yet he remains inside of me.</p><p>Wrapping his arms around me, he kisses my mouth in a slow, erotic movement of possession. Under the water, his fingers dig into my buttocks, pulling me closer still.</p><p>He kisses my throat, making my head tilt back, and he gently bites the small hollow of my pulse.</p><p>Opening my eyes, while his mouth makes love to my neck, I stare at the sky, at the tiny flashes of starlight glittering like a trillion blinks of camera flash. It\u2019s surreal. This whole thing is. This moment is.</p><p>With one hand, he palms the back of my head, bringing our mouths a whisper apart. He stares, the moonlight glistening against his wet, slick skin, and he kisses me deep, then brushes whispered words against my ear in an ancient language, words I have no understanding of. I don\u2019t dare ask their meaning.</p><p>The haze begins to fade, darken, and soon the moonlight is completely obscure. Once more that oppressive feeling comes upon me, and I have no idea what time it is, where I\u2019m at, or who I\u2019m even with. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019ll worry about it later.</p><p>All that matters at this time, this place, is the man holding me close.</p><p>He lifts his head and looks at me, a flash of light appears from nowhere, and a silver gaze meets mine, and I gasp . . .</p><p>Awareness of my surroundings floods me, and I open my eyes. Adrenaline propels me and I bolt from the bed. I\u2019m standing, naked, in my room at the Crescent. The drapes are pulled, but there is a fading light creeping in through the crack. Still daylight.</p><p>The dream. Highly erotic sex with . . .</p><p>Those eyes. Not Eli\u2019s. Not Eli at all.</p><p>Fury builds within me, begins low in my gut and fires up into my chest. I start for the door, remember that I\u2019m buck-ass naked, then turn, go to my chest, grab sweatpants and a hoodie, yank them both on, shove my feet into my Nikes, and fly out the door.</p><p>Everything is coming back to me now.</p><p>Everything.</p><p>Every. Last. Detail.</p><p>I\u2019m on fire.</p><p>Flying out of my room, I storm out into the corridor. The moment I start hurrying down the hall, I hear steel clang against steel overhead. I change directions and climb one more set of stairs, sweep into the dojo, and eyeball my target. His back is to me as he rests, bare chested, the flat of his sword against his shoulder. He\u2019s talking to Jake.</p><p>I cross the mat, yank Noah around, rear back, and punch him square in the jaw.</p><p>His sword falls to the mat.</p><p>\u201cShit! Ow!\u201d he says, holding his jaw, although I know it didn\u2019t really hurt. I just surprised him. \u201cWhat the hell, Riley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutside, Miles. Now!\u201d I say, and turn and head back out of the dojo without waiting on him.</p><p>I know he\u2019ll follow.</p><p>Meanwhile, I hide that I think I just broke my hand on his steely jawbone.</p><p>Right now, I don\u2019t give a crap. I\u2019m mad as Hell.</p><p>I fly down the corridor, down the steps, and into the receiving room. Then straight out the front doorway. Down the steps I go, and wait. I don\u2019t have to wait long.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d Noah says, his sandy brows slashes above angry mercury eyes. \u201cYou know you didn\u2019t hurt me with that punch. Your hand is probably broken, Riley. What the hell?\u201d</p><p>I round on him. I fight to keep from whacking him again. \u201cI trusted you,\u201d I say. \u201cCompletely. And now . . . how could you, Noah?\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s brows furrow closer. He\u2019s quiet for several seconds. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw you,\u201d I say, continuing my rant, then lower my voice. \u201cIt was you. In my dream. I saw your eyes, Noah. Nobody has eyes like yours.\u201d</p><p>A slow, predatory smile lifts both corners of Noah\u2019s full mouth until he is broadly smiling. \u201cDreaming of me, Poe? That\u2019s\u2014 Ow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I say in a hiss, almost in unison, shaking my head. I broke it that time. I know I did.</p><p>Noah grabs my hand, and when I try to jerk it back he pulls me closer and holds it steady. His dreads slip over my wrist as he bends his head to inspect my hand. He lifts his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s got you so riled up, girl, but I had nothing to do with your dream.\u201d He grins. \u201cNot that . . . whatever you dreamed I wouldn\u2019t want to do, because apparently you\u2019re wound up about it,\u201d he says cockily. \u201cBut swear to God.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cI\u2019m innocent this time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suddenly, other things about the dream come to mind.

I think I must be an idiot. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s face softens. \u201cNot as much as I am.\u201d</p><p>I immediately know he regrets not being in the dream.</p> <p>So, if not Noah, and not Eli, then who?</p><p>When we turn around, the entire WUP team is standing on the steps. Watching.</p><p>Victorian\u2019s brooding stare feels like a ton of bricks.</p><p>\u201cLover\u2019s spat?\u201d Jake asks, grinning. \u201cDo tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiss off,\u201d I say, passing by. \u201cI wrongly accused Miles of being in my dream. No biggie.\u201d</p><p>Jake laughs. \u201cCan\u2019t trust a vampire, Ms. Poe. Don\u2019t you know that by now? Especially one like Miles.\u201d All the guys erupt into laughter.</p> <p>\u201cIgnore them, Riley,\u201d Sydney calls out.</p><p>I ignore Jake\u2019s jab, since I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just trying to rile me more so I\u2019ll stay angry at Noah. Which I won\u2019t.</p><p>In the entranceway Noah turns to me once more. \u201cYou can trust me, Riley,\u201d he says quietly. His eyes hold mine. \u201cI\u2019d never do anything you wouldn\u2019t want me to. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for a response or a reaction, he turns and heads into the kitchen.</p><p>Speechless, I follow.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get you ready for tonight, darlin\u2019,\u201d Noah says, putting me at ease by changing the subject. \u201cJake had your and the other girls\u2019 gowns ordered. Pretty sweet, if you ask me.\u201d He grabs a bag of frozen peas from the freezer, turns, sits me down at the table, and covers my hand with the vegetable bag. He looks at me. \u201cYou won\u2019t see me there tonight, but you bet your sweet ass I\u2019ll be there. Whoever this is you\u2019re dreaming of\u201d\u2014he pauses as his gaze lights on mine\u2014\u201che\u2019s dangerous, Ri. He can infiltrate your dreams, just like Valerian and Victorian Arcos. It may be just sexual now, but you don\u2019t know what he is or what he\u2019ll turn into. Especially if it\u2019s one of the Fallen. Which I suspect he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he want with me?\u201d I ask. \u201cI\u2019m . . . nothing. I\u2019m not an Archivist. And I damn sure don\u2019t have a pure soul.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s gaze weighs heavy on mine for several moments. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know, do you?\u201d</p> <p>Slowly and bewilderedly, I shake my head.</p><p>Noah smiles and chucks my chin like a little kid. \u201cThen you probably don\u2019t need to know,\u201d he says. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want your ego getting, well, bigger than it already is.\u201d</p><p>I punch him in the thigh with my other hand. \u201cWhatever.\u201d Still, I\u2019m puzzled by what he means.</p><p>The others soon file in, and Darius, the only one not in the group, comes in from the library. \u201cI think the second relic is below the Marimae House.\u201d</p><p>We all turn and stare.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking?\u201d Jake asks.</p><p>\u201cNot one bit,\u201d Darius says. He holds a tome, and, in the pages he has opened, a map. An old map. Of Edinburgh. He points. \u201cMore than one battle between the Celts and Lowlanders occurred in the area, and more than once directly in the place of that house. Below it, some of the old catacomb passageways pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with Ms. Maspeth,\u201d Gabriel says, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cIf this otherbeing beckoning Riley is indeed one of the Fallen, then the relic may truly be there.\u201d</p><p>Jake nods. \u201cMy thoughts exactly.\u201d He turns to Lucian. \u201cYou\u2019ll go as Ginger\u2019s escort, as well. You\u2019ll all take separate cars. I\u2019ll acquire an invitation for the two of you.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cI believe you\u2019ll have to give only your name at the door.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cOkay. Sounds good.\u201d I glance at the clock on the wall. \u201cFive forty-five. I\u2019m going to get ready.\u201d I nod at Noah. \u201cThanks for the ice.\u201d</p><p>Luckily there are two bathrooms on each floor. I find one and soak in the tub for at least forty minutes. My hand already feels better and the swelling has gone down. Nice thing about having tendencies, I guess. Fast healer.</p><p>I wash my hair, don\u2019t have to shave because of that fine investment of laser hair removal, and, finally, before I\u2019m pruney, climb from the water and wrap my hair in a towel and my body in another. I add a little something to my look that I\u2019ve been aching to bring back\u2014maybe because it\u2019s how I looked when I met Eli, and I desperately want to go back to the way things were. I make my way down the corridor and to my room, and, of course, I have company at my door.</p><p>\u201cYes, Victorian, I\u2019m going to be careful. Promise.\u201d I smile at him.</p><p>He returns a grave one back. \u201cI fear for you this time,\u201d he answers solemnly.</p><p>\u201cOh, you haven\u2019t before?\u201d I say.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course,\u201d he answers. \u201cBut this . . . with the dreams . . . it\u2019s out of my control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to do the very same thing to me,\u201d I accuse. \u201cOnly you never quite took it this far.\u201d</p><p>He stares at me. \u201cMy point.\u201d</p><p>I sigh and give a nod. \u201cTaken.\u201d I move to my door. \u201cYou and the others will be there,\u201d I remind him. \u201cGabriel and Lucian inside, with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat gives me some comfort.\u201d</p><p>I smile and head inside my room. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Vic. Promise. By the way, how\u2019s Abbey doing? Jake says you\u2019ve been checking on her?\u201d That Victorian Arcos has found a soft spot for an almost vampire is . . . slightly astonishing. Curiously so.</p><p>\u201cI shall hold you to that. And Abbey is . . . well. Better, anyway.\u201d He\u2019s silent for a moment. \u201cSomething about her strikes me, I suppose.\u201d Silence again. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, Riley.\u201d</p><p>Closing the door, I shake my head and gather my makeup\u2014something I\u2019ve really not had any use for since being in Edinburgh. Tonight, though, is different.</p><p>I\u2019m solving a puzzle. And hopefully catching a killer.</p><p>Lying on my bed, wrapped in a sleeve of fine plastic, is a formal dark purple gown. Off the shoulder with a snug bodice and tulle skirt, and lined in silk, it\u2019s . . . breathtaking. Nothing I would\u2019ve found myself in had it not been for this particular event. Beside it, a box. I open it and beneath the tissue paper lies a pair of black strappy heels.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>Climbing to a different spot on the bed, I sit cross-legged and apply my makeup. I\u2019d give anything right now to have some decent tunes to put me at ease. Maybe a little Emilie Autumn, or Five Finger Death Punch. Maybe a little Paramour thrown in. Definitely some Adam Levine and Maroon Five.</p><p>Queen. Eli loved Queen.</p><p>Loved. Past tense. How I hate that word. Eli loves Queen. Better.</p><p>As I apply my base and powder, accent my brows, and brush on varying shades of smoky plum and black eye shadow, I\u2019m pulled back to the days when I rose each morning to face a crowd of happy, excited customers getting sometimes their very first ink, or those returning for their fifth, sixth, or fifteenth. I miss the hum of the Widow, the tattoo machine, and I miss the artwork. Especially the freehand. Music blasting through Inksomnia\u2019s kick-ass stereo system, and Nyx scurrying all over the place, hugging.</p><p>Nyx. How I miss my wacky best friend. I hope Eli\u2019s brother, Luc, is taking good care of her.</p><p>Luc. Phin. Josie. Elise and Gilles. Eli\u2019s family. God, they\u2019re going to be devastated when they hear of Eli\u2014nope, not even thinking it. Not until I know for sure. Preacher and Estelle. They love him, too. Jesus Christ. I\u2019ve got to make sure . . .</p><p>A sob rises in my throat like a lump, and it hurts to swallow past it. Shame floods me as I recall the dream I\u2019d just had with another. How could I? How could I have so willingly . . . forgotten? Or mistaken? How? How did I think it was Eli? It seemed so damn real. Like it was truly him. Until the eyes . . .</p><p>Seth. My brother. Preacher and Estelle. I want to hug them, smell them, hear their voices so badly, I ache for them. I know I haven\u2019t been gone that long, but I miss them all.</p><p>I take a deep breath before the tears fill my eyes and ruin my makeup.</p><p>Pulling off the lid to the eyeliner, I stare into my mini mirror, lean close, and line one eye, ending with a small sweep upward at the corners. I connect the sweeping line to the one side with my inked angel. As I\u2019m applying my second coat of mascara, I notice something out of the corner of my eye. My gaze slides behind me in my mirror. I turn around.</p><p>The little girl is there. Dressed in black. Skin luminescent. Eyes and hair as dark as her dress. She\u2019s watching me. Kind of reminds me of how Eli\u2019s sister, Josie, used to treat me. A lot of staring, no talking.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what she wants or why she seeks me out, but she no longer frightens or wigs me out. I just let her be. Maybe she\u2019s just curious about what I\u2019m doing to my face. \u201cMakeup,\u201d I say out loud. \u201cMost girls wear a lot of it to formal events.\u201d I continue sweeping my lashes. \u201cWhy are you still here? At your school?\u201d</p><p>I wait, but no answer. She\u2019s there\u2014I can feel her presence. But she remains silent.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m here if you ever want to talk. I know what they think of you,\u201d I continue, trying something else. \u201cOf killing that teacher by scaring him to death.\u201d I turn and look dead at her. I smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t look so scary to me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes, black orbs with no pupils, gaze at me long. She doesn\u2019t smile, exactly. But her face sort of . . . relaxes. Or maybe I\u2019m just seeing things.</p><p>Finished with makeup, I bend at the waist, shake my towel loose and hand-dry my hair. Jake had placed a blow-dryer in the top drawer of the chest, so I find it, plug it into the crazy-looking UK plug in the wall, and dry my hair. Done, I brush it out with a wide-tooth comb. I look at myself in the small mirror atop the chest. I stare at my newly placed hot-pink highlights. Jet-black and straight as a board is okay, but, damn, I missed my highlights. Eli always loved them. And now my hair\u2019s grown and hangs nearly to my waist. I\u2019ve lost the tan that I\u2019d gained over the late summer at Da Island, when I\u2019d gone through vamp-venom detox and my skin was back to lily white. I turn and look at the little ghost girl and grin. \u201cUp or down?\u201d I ask her, and although I get no real answer, I see her eyes shift to the top of my head. \u201cUp it is.\u201d Moving back to my bed, I gather a handful of bobby pins I\u2019d stuffed into my bag, return to the chest and mirror, and pile my hair atop my head in a messy modern style. I have several long, straight black and pink wisps hanging about my face. Not too shabby for a made-up do. Grabbing a pair of black silk panties from the top drawer, I keep my back turned and ease them up under the towel. With the girl\u2019s eyes steadily on me, I move back to the bed, pull the plastic off the dress, and slide the zipper down the side. With my back turned, I drop the towel, step into the dress, and pull it up, over my shoulders, and ease up the zipper. Smoothing my hand down the snug bodice and waist, I turn around and look at my ghostly audience. She\u2019s looking at me, first at the dress, then lifts her gaze to my eyes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I smile. \u201cYou know, I think we look a lot alike, me and you,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>The very slightest of lifts occur at the corner of her mouth, just as she gives an even slighter nod of the head.</p><p>Then, she shifts her gaze to the far side of the room. To the trunk. She moves toward it and stands there.</p> <p>I look at her. \u201cI know you\u2019re trying to tell me something.\u201d I study her longer. She points to the chest, but says nothing.</p><p>I ease toward her slowly and glance down at the chest. I open it. Inside, the scathe Gawan of Conwyk gave me. The box of holy water cartridges lays by its side.</p><p>Along with the Pict verse.</p><p>Then, Lily looks at me, turns her head, and points to the bed.</p><p>Where I\u2019d laid Eli\u2019s medallion before taking a shower.</p> <p>Our gazes hold. \u201cDo you think I can find him?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>At first, she just stares at me with those gaping black orbs. Then, she nods and points back down, to the scathe.</p><p>\u201cWith that?\u201d I ask her.</p><p>Again, she nods. Then, she turns and crosses the chamber and stands beside the hearth. She simply stares at me. Somehow, those black orbs beckon me. She points to the hearth.</p><p>A loud rap at the door sends her into a blurred vapor. Then gone.</p><p>\u201cSee ya,\u201d I whisper, staring at the place she\u2019d just pointed. I\u2019ll talk to her again. Later. Then I turn to the door. \u201cIt\u2019s open.\u201d</p> <p>Noah walks in, and I hear his intake of breath at the doorway. \u201cDamn, Poe,\u201d he says after several seconds. He walks over to me, gives me the twice-over, his gaze lingering as it goes from the hem of my gown up to the bodice. Those mercury eyes finally meet mine. \u201cDamn. The pink is back. Good.\u201d</p><p>I give him the twice-over, too. He\u2019s dressed in a tailored black tux. Sun-bleached dreads are pulled back with a black leather and silver clasp. His face is marked by ridiculous beauty no man should ever possess. He had to have had the shit beat out of him before he became a vampire. Pretty boys always get beat up.</p><p>A slow smile transforms his face. I don\u2019t know how to describe it. Part arrogant. Part predatory. Part . . . endearing.</p><p>Only if you know and love him, I guess.</p><p>I remember a time when I wanted to beat him up, too.</p><p>I meet his gaze. \u201cDamn,\u201d I say in return. \u201cYou clean up pretty nice, Miles. But I didn\u2019t think you were going to the event. Only lurking outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJake says to lurk outside, you need to look as if you belong inside,\u201d he answers. He stretches one arm out and dusts off imaginary lint with his hand. \u201cNot bad, if I say so myself.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes. \u201cHold on, let me get my shoes.\u201d I turn to the bed, pull the heels out of the box, and slip them on. I walk back to him and look up. \u201cI\u2019m almost as tall as you are now.\u201d</p> <p>Noah\u2019s jaw muscles flex as he looks at me. His eyes are smoky gray. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Riley. In a gown or a sweaty pair of training pants. Either way,\u201d he says. \u201cExquisite.\u201d</p><p>Heat floods my scalp. \u201cI think you\u2019re making me blush,\u201d I answer, and pat my cheeks. \u201cAre you wearing your special hoodoo concoction that keeps your sexuality tamped down?\u201d</p><p>Noah has a special feature. He\u2019s so sexually potent and alluring to females\u2014of all species\u2014that he has to wear a charmed mixture of hoodoo herbs around his neck, or females everywhere will throw and claw their way into his pants. Sounds like something he\u2019d love, I know, but, according to him, after a couple of centuries of it, he grew weary. I can tell you firsthand, though, when he\u2019s not wearing the charm, he\u2019s . . . a mess. Let\u2019s just say that. A freaking mess.</p><p>He grins. Wide.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cOh, wait one more sec.\u201d I go to my chest, grab the feather-light sheath and strap and my silver dirk, slide it up under the skirt of my gown and attach it to my thigh. I ease the dirk into the sheath. I eye the scathe\u2019s hiding place, in the trunk. I want to take it but Jason had said the best place for it was gripped in my hand. That\u2019s a no-go tonight. For now, it stays. My hope soars now with the possibility of finding Eli. Even if it means delving into the Underworld. I sure as Hell will do it. In a heartbeat. \u201cOkay, ready.\u201d Noah, whose gaze is kinda stuck to my thigh, shakes his head and sticks out his arm for me to take, and I do. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d I say, and look at him sideways. \u201cArrogant, pervy ass.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s laugh fills the corridor.</p><p>\u201cWho were you talking to when I first came to your door?\u201d he asks as we head downstairs.</p><p>We pass the darkened alcove midway down the corridor, and I see Lily in the recesses of the shadows. As we pass, I smile and give her a little wave. She literally smiles back at me. \u201cOh, someone who reminds me a lot of me.\u201d</p><p>Noah\u2019s questioning look makes me laugh out loud.</p><p>Downstairs, I have to catch my breath. Honest. I gasp. Out loud.</p><p>Imagine a room full of vampires, werewolves, and immortal druids, all in black Armani tuxedos and lovely formal gowns. Breathtaking is all I can say. I admit, I\u2019m the . . . oddball, I guess. I\u2019m the one with the dragon tattoos exposed and the wing on my face. Where Ginger and Sydney are stunning in their gowns, Ginger in a champagne blush and Sydney in soft plum, they have jewelry to match. I wear no jewelry. My ink, my art, is my jewelry. I don\u2019t even have earrings.</p><p>\u201cAnd it is spectacular,\u201d whispers Noah in my ear. I squeeze his arm.</p><p>\u201cRiley, simply gorgeous,\u201d Jake says in front of everyone, making me want to roll my eyes and punch him for singling me out. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in a cab alone. Gabriel and Sydney, MacLeod and Ginger, you\u2019ll be in separate cabs. Darius, you ride with Arcos. Miles, you\u2019re with me. We\u2019ll arrive first. Riley,\u201d he says, looking at me with admiration and a quick twice-over. \u201cYou will arrive last.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>Outside, the night air is heavy, but not so much brine this time. That sweet, cloverlike scent rides the chilly breeze, and Peter hands me a silk wrap as I wait for my cab. \u201cYou look lovely, miss,\u201d he says. \u201cI would drive you myself, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s okay, Peter,\u201d I say hurriedly, remembering the ride from Hell he gave us from the airport. \u201cBut thank you for the wrap. And for waiting with me.\u201d</p><p>He grins. His nose is, as always, red. \u201cYou\u2019re most welcome, miss.\u201d</p><p>I watch the sun drop as we wait outside the Crescent, and the sky once more has turned varying shades of purple and gray. Soon, my cab arrives, and Peter opens the door for me. \u201cThe Marimae House, please sir,\u201d he tells the cab driver. Then hands him twenty pounds. \u201cThis should cover it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d the cabby answers. \u201cCheers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheers,\u201d Peter answers, and waves to me.</p><p>I wave back and we take off to New Town.</p><p>Traffic is heavy, and the cab driver takes several side roads that I\u2019m unfamiliar with\u2014especially once out of Old Town. I can see, though, why even though it\u2019s called New Town, the ground itself is still as ancient as Old Town. Which is why a particular battle was fought between the painted warriors of the north and the lowlanders. By the time we arrive, I\u2019m stunned. Marimae House is a large manor home, at least three or four hundred years old, and it has a wide, sweeping circular drive that we pull into and get in a short line of black cabs dropping off guests.</p><p>It\u2019s precisely seven p.m. when my cab stops at the front entrance. A concierge is there to open my door and assist me out. I don\u2019t need assisting, but I allow it anyway. The damn humming has started up in my ears again. I guess I should\u2019ve seen a doctor by now. I ignore it as best as I can, push it aside. It dulls.</p><p>The manor home is of aged stone and five stories high. With an impressive front face, it has two fountains out front with mermen and mermaids spewing water. I can vaguely see a large garden in the back as I start up a two-flight winding staircase</p><p>The moment I enter the home, I search for signs of the WUP team. Way across the room, I spy Ginger and Lucian, standing together near an enormous and intricately carved hearth and sipping a drink. They don\u2019t see me. I continue to scan the room. No sign of Sydney and Gabriel. No telling where they are. Probably digging up the garden, looking for the relic.</p><p>I see no sign of the others. I continue to walk through the manor. In the next room is a huge parquet dance floor, and several couples are twirling around to ancient music. Ballroom music. Never did learn to dance like that. I\u2019m more of a dirty dancer, I guess you\u2019d say.</p><p>\u201cMiss, would you care to dance?\u201d</p><p>I turn around and face . . . a very old guy. Cute, lots of white hair going every which way, but old. I smile. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He leads me out on the dance floor, and that\u2019s when I catch a glimpse of Jake. He\u2019s watching me from a table of drinks, where three women are all vying for his attention. A slight smile lifts his mouth and he gives me a slighter nod.</p><p>Prick.</p><p>He then excuses himself and walks hastily from the dance hall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very good,\u201d the old man says to me. I look down at him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your markings,\u201d he says, and grins widely. \u201cAnd your pink hair.\u201d</p><p>I try not to laugh. \u201cWell, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>We dance a few more minutes, until I notice the guy is actually getting a little winded, and we stop. \u201cThanks,\u201d I say, and he ambles off. Before I can even glance at the crowd, a voice whispers at the back of my neck, close to my ear. \u201cDon\u2019t turn around.\u201d</p><p>My insides seize.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an exquisite dancer,\u201d he says, his voice silky smooth and oh, so familiar. \u201cWalk straight ahead into the next room.\u201d</p><p>I make my way through the crowd of charity-event goers and into the next room, as instructed. Only a few people occupy it. Chairs and settees are situated about, and I feel his hand now at the small of my back. It sends shivers down my spine. I hate that.</p><p>\u201cJust at the far end of the room is a doorway. Go through it.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not nervous, like life-in-danger nervous. I\u2019m . . . anxious. I want to see whoever this person is. I walk ahead, find the door, open it, and go through it. It\u2019s another dimly lit room, rather a passageway. One small lamp hangs overhead and gives off a soft amber glow. The sound of metal clicking reaches my ear. The door is now locked. The chamber is chilled, empty. We are totally alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Strong, callused hands move to my shoulders and slowly turn me around. My breath lodges in my throat when my eyes meet my company: long, silver-blond hair hangs straight past his broad shoulders, half of it pulled behind his head and secured. Eyes nearly the same color as his hair stare down at me, and they look like liquid metal. Full lips, sensually curved, sit above a square chin and strong jaw. Perfectly shaped brows lift. \u201cNot what you expected?\u201d he asks.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014 Who are you?\u201d I manage. His beauty is so great, it almost hurts to look at him. Literally.</p><p>His sexy lips curve. \u201cMy name is Athios.\u201d His eyes move to where his hands rest on my shoulders, and his fingers skim down my arm, tracing my dragons. His gaze lifts. \u201cYou are the most exquisite woman I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he says, amazement lining his unusual accent.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d I ask, uncomfortable with how sexual this stranger makes me feel simply by touching my arms. \u201cWhy did you want me to come here tonight? Why do you sneak into my dreams? I thought you were . . . someone else.\u201d</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI . . . don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t help myself.\u201d His silvery gaze lingers on mine. \u201cI had to see you again. I have only imagined you. Like this. Inside your head. Inside my head.\u201d His gaze drinks me in. \u201cBut to see you in life, standing before me, under my touch? I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re real.\u201d</p><p>His words even turn me on. That low hum is beginning to get the best of me, and my concentration is slipping. Why is my body reacting to him? I\u2019m angered at myself for even thinking it. I want to leave, yet I don\u2019t. \u201cYou are one of the Fallen.\u201d</p><p>His jaw muscles flex. \u201cNot willingly, but yes, I am. And you\u2019re one of the hunters.\u201d</p><p>Slowly I nod. I can\u2019t seem to take my eyes off his . . . eyes. They\u2019re mesmerizing. His scent, his entire being is intoxicating. I don\u2019t understand it, and confusion makes me frown. The ringing . . . it\u2019s starting to make me dizzy again. The hum is now a whine, like the low-pitched sound a dog hears. I want to cover my ears.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cRinging. In my ears. Hurts.\u201d I clasp my hands over my ears.</p><p>Athios grazes my temples with his fingertips, and the humming stops. \u201c\u2019Tis the relics, I fear,\u201d he says. \u201cYour acute hearing is attuned with their low frequency.\u201d</p><p>I blink. I\u2019ve been hearing the freaking relics the whole time? Now my body heats, and I can\u2019t take my eyes off of Athios. Again, I frown.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asks. His hands skim down my sides, pulling me closer.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answer honestly. \u201cI . . . know this is wrong, yet I can\u2019t help myself,\u201d I say. \u201cYou are controlling me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy is it wrong?\u201d he asks. \u201cDo you not recall the other night? The one we shared with such passion?\u201d He lifts my chin with his hand and forces me to look at him. \u201cHow can that have been anything but right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me,\u201d I say. \u201cI know that the Fallen seek pure souls. Mine is anything but, so don\u2019t get any funny ideas about sucking mine out of me.\u201d</p><p>Athios laughs low, deep. \u201cThat\u2019s the farthest thing from my mind,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I do know you, Riley Poe. From the very first encounter, I scanned your entire soul. I know what your very first cognitive thoughts were, all the way up until now.\u201d He grazes my jaw with his thumb. \u201cI know your whole life. And I admire the person you are. I envy your fianc\u00e9. You\u2019re an amazing woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know you at all,\u201d I answer, feeling the drug of his touch against my skin. \u201cHow do you know my fianc\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me better than most,\u201d he answers, ignoring my question about Eli. \u201cPlease hold still, Riley,\u201d he whispers, drawing close. \u201cJust for a moment.\u201d</p><p>I go deathly still as he leans toward me, head bent, and brushes his lips over mine. His silky hair slips over my shoulder, and the sensation across my skin makes me shudder. His lips are full, pliable, and they move expertly over mine in a possessive caress, tasting me with his tongue, pulling at my bottom lip with his teeth. My hands move to his chest, up the collar of his tux, and around his neck to pull him closer. His hands move over my back, pulling me against his body. I can\u2019t seem to get close enough. His lips claim mine seductively, softly, slowly, and I sigh into him. What\u2019s wrong with me? Why can\u2019t I stop? Instead I urge him on, moaning softly against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cAthios,\u201d I whisper, kissing him back. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d My mind whirls, and deep inside, I grasp onto what little control I have left. My hand moves to my thigh, and slowly, I inch my gown\u2019s hem up. My fingers grate my blade, and I release it from the sheath. Gently, I lift it until the blade rests against Athios\u2019s throat.</p><p>\u201cGet off of me,\u201d I say with a growl. Control is barely in my grasp. I press the blade harder, and Athios flinches. \u201cNow.\u201d</p> <p>Athios pulls back just a fraction. \u201cImpressive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn her the fuck loose before I take your head right here,\u201d a voice says vehemently in the corridor.</p><p>\u201cDo as he says,\u201d another voice demands. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Two bodies fly toward us, and I\u2019m shoved backward against the wall. My head smacks the hard, sharp stone and immediately I\u2019m dizzy, and I feel drugged. The bulb is hit and is swinging on its long cord, making shadows and light dance all through the passageway. I hear nothing but fists, grunts, and swearing at first, then the sharp clang of steel against steel. I see nothing; it\u2019s pitch-black.</p><p>And I know that voice, those curses, belong to Jake. The other is Victorian.</p><p>The fighting continues, and I try to stumble up to help. Stop it! I demand to anyone who will listen. No one does. Jake! The second relic is here somewhere! He just told me! Still, the fighting continues as if no one hears me.</p><p>In the fast flashes of light as the lamp swings back and forth, I see Victorian and Jake have both changed; their jaws are dropped, fangs protruding, eyes ablaze. It does nothing to deter Athios. Then, all at once, everyone freezes. No one makes a move or a sound. The air chills even more inside the chamber, and a fierce wind blows through. Suddenly, two more have joined. They stand by Athios. Older. Both wearing tuxedos. One lifts his hand toward Victorian and makes a rising motion, lifting his writhing body up. Jake lifts his sword and charges the two. Then, before I realize what\u2019s happening, the one makes a quick flick of his wrist toward Victorian. He completely . . . vanishes.</p><p>I pull every ounce of concentration I have into a small, condensed ball in the center of my chest. I focus on the two Fallen. Leave here. Now!</p><p>Nothing happens. No one moves. I strain harder.</p><p>Pain, seize their bodies!</p><p>This time, I can barely make out their faces. They\u2019re pinched in pain. One points toward Jake.</p><p>Jake! Leave here now!</p><p>Jake\u2019s face, although filled with rage, charges both Fallen. I aim and throw my blade at one of the older Fallen. It lodges in his chest. They go down, and Jake escapes the way we came through.</p><p>Then, everything changes. The room is tilting\u2014at least it feels that way. I shake my head to clear it, but that makes it worse. A black shade is being pulled over my eyes, or a shadow\u2014I can\u2019t tell. Just before I black out my body is lifted, and I feel space and air flying past me at lightning speed. It\u2019s almost nauseating. Soon, though, my stomach is at ease, and I\u2019m floating into darkness. . . .</p><p>\u201cVictorian!\u201d I bolt up, my eyes scanning my surroundings. My vision is blurry, and it takes a few seconds for it to clear. It\u2019s almost dusk, which means yet another full day has passed. Gulls scream overhead. The heavy scent of brine fills the air, and the crashing of waves against rock echoes. It\u2019s cold in here, damp, and as I look around I realize I\u2019m in ruins that I don\u2019t recognize.</p><p>Memories rush back.</p><p>Victorian is gone.</p><p>The other two in the passageway were the other Black Fallen. And they\u2019d had the power to make Jake Andorra freeze in his tracks. They\u2019ve sent Vic somewhere. He just . . . disappeared. Or was he dead? Christ, was that it?</p><p>Two? I\u2019ve lost two now?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Throwing the covers off, I find I\u2019m still wearing my gown. I snatch up the hem and feel for my blade. Miraculously, it\u2019s still sheathed. I grab for it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve no need for that,\u201d Athios says. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cBecause I would have already done so. Besides, I left you your dirk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other two\u2014Black Fallen?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Athios answers. \u201cMy . . . brethren, so to speak.\u201d He says that with disdain, and it\u2019s unmistakable.</p><p>\u201cThey killed Victorian,\u201d I say, and an uncontrolled sob rips from my throat. \u201cFuck!\u201d I say, then scream it louder as it echoes off the decayed stone. \u201cFuck!\u201d I move to what used to be a grand arched window and look out over the ocean. A fierce, cold wind blows against my face, and I welcome it. It dries my tears.</p><p>Victorian and Eli are both gone. I can\u2019t even come to grips with it.</p><p>\u201cI was warned about the powers of the Black Fallen,\u201d I say out loud, facing the sea. \u201cI really didn\u2019t believe it until last night.\u201d I turn to Athios. \u201cYou are unstoppable.\u201d</p><p>Athios, his jacket removed now, still wears the remainder of his tux. The tie is loosened from his starched white shirt. He moves closer. \u201cI\u2019m not like them.\u201d</p><p>I study him for a moment. I believe him. \u201cWhat about Jake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe escaped. Thanks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I ask, bewildered. \u201cThey could\u2019ve gone after him. Followed him out to the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Athios says, moving closer still. \u201cThey preferred instead to come after me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what that means, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good. \u201cYou know we\u2019ve found the first relic?\u201d I ask. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Athios nods. \u201cYour team has found the second, as well,\u201d he answers. \u201cAnd soon to find the third.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d I ask. I know he\u2019s moving closer to me, and I allow it. I know he won\u2019t hurt me.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s here.\u201d He swipes his arm. \u201cAnd the inscription on the second relic is quite explicit.\u201d</p> <p>Confusion webs my brain. \u201cHow in the hell do you know that?\u201d I ask.</p><p>Athios is standing in front of me now, and he lifts a thumb to my eye and wipes the edge. \u201cSmeared mascara,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause. I am the one who hid them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re not the younger of the Fallen,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re the oldest.\u201d</p><p>Athios nods. \u201cJust . . . younger in appearances. I was younger when I became an angel. But after so many centuries of life on earth, I can hardly be called young anymore.\u201d</p><p>I feel myself being drawn to him again. \u201cAthios, please. If you\u2019re using your angel/Fallen mind-woogie on me, don\u2019t.\u201d I look at him. \u201cPlease. Let me have my own faculties. For now.\u201d</p> <p>He simply stares at me with those silvery metal eyes. \u201cI find myself wanting to touch you. Always. It\u2019s . . . difficult not to.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to respond to that, so I don\u2019t. Instead I question. \u201cSo, if you\u2019re not like them, what are you like?\u201d</p><p>Athios smiles. \u201cI\u2019m a Death Walker, now,\u201d he states.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cI made an ill-fated mistake as an angel by hiding the relics and, ultimately, the Seiagh. I wanted them not only for myself, but to keep them away from others who wouldn\u2019t know how to properly use its magic. It can be a dark, evil book, and I\u2019ve seen too many souls turn black because of it.\u201d He looks out at the sea. \u201cBut because I hid it for my own gain, no matter the reasoning, I was banished as a Fallen.\u201d He turns to me. \u201cAnd the only way to rectify myself is to see its destruction.\u201d He laughs softly. \u201cWhich, ultimately, leads to my own.\u201d</p><p>I meet his gaze and hold it for sometime, mesmerized once more by the silver beauty. I shake my head and look out over the ocean. \u201cDamn, Athios.\u201d</p> <p>He laughs and slides a little closer to me. \u201cThe North Sea is a tumultuous beauty. Is it not?\u201d he asks.</p><p>I watch the water for a moment, at the constant white caps that tip the dark water. Seabirds dip and dive into it for fish, and the crashing of it against the rocks foretells its fury. \u201cYes, it certainly is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch like you,\u201d he says. \u201cRiley Poe.\u201d</p><p>I turn to him, lean my elbow against the derelict wall of the ruin. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cTantallon Castle,\u201d he offers. \u201cA grand fortress in its prime. None other like it, save Dunnottar to the northeast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it no one is around? Tourists, I mean?\u201d I question. In the distance, I see the parking lot. Totally empty. Nothing but green grass and ruins.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve charmed it,\u201d he admits. \u201cEven from my brethren and yours. But it won\u2019t last long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d I ask.</p> <p>He lifts my chin with his knuckle. \u201cLong enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAthios,\u201d I look at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know you. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not. And I\u2019ve just lost my fianc\u00e9. This . . . isn\u2019t right. I would\u2019ve never done it on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he says, and takes my hand and places it in his. \u201cGet to know me.\u201d</p><p>My head spins, the world darkens, and I slip into another life, another time. . . .</p><p>Part Ten</p><p>ABSOLUTE RESTITUTION</p><p>And then there stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note, the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave.</p><p>\u2014Edgar Allan Poe, \u201cThe Pit and the Pendulum\u201d</p><p>All along, I\u2019ve known how wrong it\u2019s been to take advantage of Riley, even knowing she\u2019d just lost her love. I can\u2019t help myself. She\u2019s everything I\u2019ve always wanted. Aye, I\u2019ve used my powers to lure her, and I make myself forget at times that I\u2019ve done such because her reaction to me, to my touch, is so powerful . . . it\u2019s what will help me survive what I\u2019m about to endure.</p><p>\u2014Athios</p><p>Just that fast, I\u2019m back.</p><p>I\u2019ve just witnessed Athios\u2019s entire life. And death. And rebirth.</p><p>He smiles down at me. \u201cNow you know me.\u201d</p><p>It somehow comforts me to know Athios is truly not a Black Fallen. He\u2019s a victim of circumstance who took the fall. A big fall. His heart is pure. And unlike the other Fallen, he has never stolen a soul. He instead visits the emergency room, where the dying are headed out the door anyway. He uses a little of their life force to maintain his substance here on earth. No one hurt. No foul done.</p><p>And he\u2019s only doing it until the Seiagh is found and destroyed.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you wait so long?\u201d I ask. \u201cIf you\u2019ve known all along where the Seiagh is, why wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was written that way,\u201d he says. \u201cNot until the Archivist arrives could events unfold. Ms. Maspeth only just arrived a year ago. I had no choice but to let things unfold as they would have naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, by now my team has found the second relic?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He glances at the sky. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long now until the third relic is found.\u201d His gaze returns to mine. \u201cI fear there\u2019s going to be a war, Riley. My brethren have created an army of Jod\u00eds. They\u2019ll bring them all. No match for your team. And my priority now is to keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>Yet another man wanting to ensure my safety. Where were all these guys when I was boozing it up and smoking weed as a teenager?</p><p>\u201cNo, your main priority, Athios, is to make sure the Seiagh is destroyed.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a slight nod. \u201cCorrect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m going to fight when my team arrives and the Jod\u00eds and Fallen get here?\u201d</p><p>Athios sighs. \u201cI feared as much. But, yes, I guessed you would.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cPlease know I never meant any harm to come to your friend,\u201d he says. I had no idea my brethren had followed us. I would\u2019ve taken you . . . elsewhere.\u201d He sighs again. \u201cBut I wanted to ensure your team found the second relic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my fianc\u00e9? Eli?\u201d I ask. It almost hurts to say his name now. And I\u2019m not sure I want to hear his answer.</p><p>\u201cYour fianc\u00e9?\u201d</p><p>I look at him.</p><p>He glances across the ruins, in the opposite direction of the sea. \u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I glance in the direction Athios does, and although I don\u2019t see anything, I believe him. I can hear voices in the distance.</p><p>\u201cRiley, please,\u201d Athios says, and cups my jaw with his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get to say a proper good-bye once this starts,\u201d he goes on. \u201cCan I have one last thing for my soul to keep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d The moment my mouth opens, Athios lowers his head and claims it with his. Long and possessive, his velvety warm tongue gently and slowly explores me, tasting the corners of my mouth, suckling on my bottom lip. His hands move down my back to cup my bottom and pull me tightly against him. Fire shoots through my veins and my hands wrap around his neck and, God help me, I can\u2019t stop. I kiss him back.</p><p>I kiss him good-bye.</p><p>His mouth slows, his lips resting against mine, gently kissing, inhaling. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispers against me. \u201cLike it or not, you\u2019ll always be with me, Riley Poe.\u201d</p><p>I pull back and look into his mesmerizing eyes, liquid metal shimmering in the fading light. They\u2019re almost the color of his hair now, which also has an unusual shade of silver tinting it. I don\u2019t understand any of this. Not a bit.</p><p>But it\u2019s real. That much I know.</p><p>Then Athios kisses one cheek and whispers something in my ear in that foreign, painful language of angels. He does the same with the next cheek, the next ear. It sounds . . . familiar. How, I don\u2019t know, especially since I just thought it was so foreign. But I\u2019ve heard it before. He pulls back and looks at me. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe now. But still, be careful. Watch your teammates. They\u2019ll need it. And when the Seiagh is destroyed, take cover. A gale like you\u2019ve never experienced will occur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d I ask. Somehow, and for some reason, I care.</p><p>He smiles. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. And also, know this. You may still have a chance to rescue your mate. And, your friend. Your mentor, Conwyk, gave you a . . . tool. Speak to him. He\u2019ll know where you can look for your man. Now.\u201d He sweeps down and takes a final kiss from me. \u201cUntil, Riley Poe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d</p><p>Out of nowhere, a tumultuous force as fierce as the North Sea appears. It\u2019s Noah, and his rage is evident in his morphed appearance, the change in his voice. He lunges at Athios like a bolt of lightning. The wind picks up, and before my eyes, Athios disappears.</p><p>Gone. Like a vapor.</p><p>Noah swears and grabs me by the shoulders and turns me to face him. He doesn\u2019t even change back. His face is full-blown vampire, jaw unhinged, fangs dropped, and mercury eyes on fire.

And that\u2019s all I can manage.</p><p>\u201cI know, honey,\u201d he says, and for a second I almost want to laugh. A full-blown vampire calling me honey. It strikes me. \u201cEli and Vic might still be alive!\u201d I yell. \u201cAthios just told me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll search after this\u201d\u2014he sweeps his hand over the air\u2014\u201cis over!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d I holler back.</p><p>He nods. \u201cHere!\u201d he yells, and hands me my sword. \u201cBe careful!\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes.</p><p>The others hurry into the ruin. \u201cRiley!\u201d Sydney and Ginger yell simultaneously. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, fine,\u201d I holler back. \u201cLet\u2019s get this done!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d Darius says, and we all run along the parapet, down a winding flight of derelict steps and across the courtyard to another ruined building. He ducks inside, and we all follow. Everyone is wearing training gear.</p><p>I\u2019m still in a formal gown.</p><p>With a sword.</p> <p>Inside, Noah leans close. \u201cYou scared the hell out of me, Poe,\u201d he says. I look at him, and his familiar mercury eyes, very different from Athios\u2019s, now that I\u2019ve had a good look at both, comfort me. \u201cDon\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here somewhere!\u201d Darius yells over the steadily raging wind. It\u2019s whistling and whining through the cracks and holes of the old kirk we now stand in. \u201cSydney?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere!\u201d she yells, and Darius moves to where she points. To a recessed altar in the stone.</p><p>\u201cAh. I see you\u2019ve found it for us,\u201d a voice calls out. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>My words, Riley. Use them. Now. The words whispered across my cheeks. The painful language. I stare at the remaining Black Fallen, and I know I have to act fast. Dredging up the words Athios placed in my head, I will them out, past my lips, onto my tongue. So painful, and nausea stirs in my stomach and my knees weaken. Still, I say them, just as Athios had said them to me. The Fallen stare at me, their silvery gazes fixed, wide, and . . . frightened. They aren\u2019t moving. Standing still as death. But their monsters are in full swing.</p> <p>Shit.</p><p>A thunderous sound kicks up, and I realize it\u2019s not thunder but voices. Deep, grumbling voices. Lots of them. I glance out over the field and see a small army moving toward us.</p><p>Tristan de Barre. Gawan of Conwyk.</p><p>And about fifteen big-ass guys dressed in full chain-mail armor.</p><p>With swords.</p><p>\u201cSydney! Riley!\u201d Jake calls out, and I turn and catch the first Jod\u00eds head of the evening. He\u2019d lunged so fast that I almost missed it.</p> <p>\u201cRiley, help Sydney!\u201d Noah yells.</p><p>\u201cNot until they get up here!\u201d I say, inclining my head toward Tristan and the others.</p><p>I fight. Hard. And somehow we push back the two Fallen and the Jod\u00eds enough for Sydney and I to ease in behind Darius. Lucian and Ginger transform\u2014and I mean fast. Like, blur\u2014wolf. I\u2019m not sure if ripping a Jod\u00eds\u2019 head off is the same as hacking it off with a sword, but it looks like it has the same effect. Lucian, an enormous black wolf, rips the head off a Jod\u00eds with his jaws and spits it out, and the white, gross, screaming pile of pus ensues.</p><p>That\u2019d be a yes, then.</p><p>The roar of warriors almost deafens me, and I see just enough of Tristan, in full steel chain-mail and helm, hacking his sword like it was another of his own appendages, to turn to help Sydney. To my surprise, she\u2019s already got the stone covering the Seiagh halfway out. \u201cAlmost got it\ufffd\ufffd\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley!\u201d</p><p>I turn just as one of the Fallen lunges at me. They must have broken free of the spell Athios gave to me. Why he didn\u2019t use his willy-nilly powers on me, I don\u2019t know. But I react. In my gown, I leap high and swing with all my might toward his head.</p><p>I watch it roll for a few feet before it disintegrates into a pile of ash.</p> <p>Like the rest of his body.</p><p>When I land, Sydney has the Seiagh in her hand. My insides shake as I hear her incite some verse, and the language sounds a lot like the one spoken by Athios.</p><p>In the next instant, Sydney retrieves a silver dirk from her waistband and jabs it into the Seiagh\u2019s center. With a shout, Sydney drops the old tome. The ancient volume bursts into flames. It is destroyed. Never again to harm humanity.</p><p>Or another innocent angel.</p><p>The storm has ceased now, and the only thing ringing through the ruins now are the sound of steel against steel, steel against rubbery gross neck, and the thuds of heads hitting the stone floor. When Sydney and I run from the kirk, the scene in the courtyard and in the ruins is like a scene from a medieval movie. I jump in and start swinging until the last Jod\u00eds falls.</p><p>But there is still one Fallen left, and he\u2019s standing in the center of the courtyard surrounded by Jake, Gabriel, Darius, the lupines, Noah, and the warriors. I know what the Fallen are capable of, so I use what control I might have to keep him from attacking. Darius recites a verse in his own language, then lops off the Fallen\u2019s head in one swing. It\u2019s the end of the battle. Tristan, Gawan, and their men stand, sweating, but all alive. Not one innocent life lost.</p><p>Piles of dead Jod\u00eds are everywhere.</p><p>\u201cDamn me, girl,\u201d Tristan says, walking up to me and pulling off his helmet. His long dark hair is plastered to his head, and brilliant blue eyes gaze at me with a twinkle. \u201cYou must\u2019ve had a fine, fine instructor. You\u2019re amazing with the blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in a ball gown, no less,\u201d Gawan says, joining him. He, unlike the others, wears no helmet nor any armor. Still sweaty, though, and larger-than-life. \u201cFine fighting, lass.\u201d</p><p>Just his ink markings alone would scare off most, I think to myself. \u201cThanks, guys,\u201d I say, and wipe my forehead with my forearm. \u201cI had great teachers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised no tourists were milling about,\u201d Tristan says. \u201cUsually they\u2019re all over Tantallon.\u201d</p><p>I know why, but I\u2019ll tell them all later. I doubt they\u2019d even believe me right now that one of the Fallen wasn\u2019t quite so Black, and he\u2019d used a charm to keep innocents out.</p><p>\u201cOne of the Fallen escaped,\u201d Jake says. He rests against his sword and eyes me. \u201cDisappeared into thin air.\u201d</p><p>I guess I\u2019ll be explaining that one a little sooner than later.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d Sydney says. \u201cI\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>A roar of grumbling ayes fills the ruins. It will take a small army to feed Tristan and his men, for sure.</p><p>I smile at the big Dragonhawk knight. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came,\u201d I say. \u201cEven gladder you didn\u2019t get dead.\u201d</p><p>He gives me a crooked grin. \u201cAye, woman, me also.\u201d He cocks his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to come to Dreadmoor soon. My wife, Andrea, wants to meet you.\u201d</p><p>I give a nod. \u201cI accept that invite.\u201d</p><p>Tristan smiles and moves off to speak with Gabriel.</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d Jake says beside me. \u201cI\u2019m . . . sorry. About Arcos. I . . . couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Jake. It wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d I answer. \u201cI knew that right away. Besides,\u201d I look at him closely, \u201che may be with Eli.\u201d</p><p>He nods. \u201cYou have a lot to tell me, girl,.\u201d</p><p>I smile. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, he pushes off his sword. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>As a group, from afar, we must\u2019ve looked like a big reenactment troupe or something like that. Who would\u2019ve thought, though, that this gang of warriors, including one in a ball gown, was from other places, other times, once dead, vampires, werewolves, and one human with tendencies?</p><p>No one. In their right mind, that is.</p><p>\u201cRiley, the scathe?\u201d Gawan asks.</p><p>I look at him. \u201cI\u2019ve been told you might can guide me to a good place to look. I\u2019ll need your help.\u201d</p><p>He grabs me by the shoulder and squeezes. \u201cI pray you\u2019ll ready yourself in something other than a gown?\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s all it took. One little touch from Gawan.</p><p>And I\u2019m there. . . .</p><p>Gawan stood, frozen to the very last step, and stared at the beauty whose gaze he couldn\u2019t tear away from. Their eyes were fastened within the mirror\u2019s reflection, and they stayed that way for a score of seconds or minutes. He knew not which.</p><p>Suddenly, it hurt to breathe, and every muscle burned as his body tensed. Unable to move, he simply stood. And stared.</p><p>Before he knew what was happening, his lips began to move\u2014at first a whisper. A stunned, coarse whisper. The ancient Welsh verse barely reached his own ears.</p><p>Not once did his gaze leave hers.</p><p>\u201cI mewn hon buchedd a I mewn \u2019r \u2019n gyfnesaf\u2014\u201d he began, his voice breaking like a lad of sixteen.</p><p>\u201cAdduneda \u2019m cara atat forever \u2019n ddarpar . . .\u201d she finished on a whisper.</p><p>In this life and into the next, I vow my love to you, forever, Intended . . .</p><p>Gawan\u2019s throat closed, his heart slammed into his ribs, and a tidal wave of memories crashed over him, yet his feet, thank the saints, began to move, closer to the woman standing barefoot upon his straight-backed chair, staring into his oval mirror. His woman.</p><p>His Intended.</p><p>It was then he noticed a tear sliding down her cheek, her body trembling. A small black purse she\u2019d been clutching slipped from her fingers and fell to the floor.</p><p>When he reached her, he grasped her around the waist and set her on the floor. Slowly, he turned her around.</p><p>Her eyes were squinched tightly shut, tears trailing out of them and down her cheeks.</p><p>With a ragged breath, Gawan lifted her chin, and fought the crushing urge to pull her into a ferocious embrace she\u2019d not be able to tear free of. Saints, he wasn\u2019t even sure he could manage another bloody word, much less a score of them. Christ, he remembered.</p><p>\u201cEllie, open your eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Her body shook beneath his hands, and he squeezed a bit tighter, just in case she started to slip to the floor. Her breathing, like his own, became labored, as though she\u2019d been running for her very life.</p><p>Slowly her lids cracked open, and the most beautiful, tear-soaked, blue-green eyes stared back at him. Her mouth moved, but no words came out.</p><p>Gawan bent his head closer.</p><p>And then, he quickly realized, no words were needed.</p><p>Ellie threw her arms around Gawan\u2019s neck and pulled his head down. Their lips met, settled, and simply melded.</p><p>Wrapping his arms tightly about her, he lifted her off the floor and allowed memory after memory to assail him, reveled in the familiar feeling of his Intended\u2019s lips against his, the taste of her on his tongue, her soft body, made just for him, pressed against him.</p><p>Then her mouth began to move against his, and he pulled back, reluctantly so, just to hear her sweet words.</p><p>\u201cYou found me,\u201d she said, in between a series of wet, sloppy kisses. \u201cGawan of Conwyk.\u201d She bit his lower lip. \u201cJunior warlord.\u201d She dragged a slow kiss across his mouth. \u201cAngel extraordinaire.\u201d After a long, sensual kiss that nearly made him shout, she whispered against his lips, \u201cMy Intended.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A thunderous bellow echoed across the great hall, followed by several more, and as Gawan and Ellie turned around, they found the entire Dreadmoor garrison, along with every ghostie within a hundred kilometers, standing behind them, cheering.</p><p>Ellie laughed and buried her face into Gawan\u2019s neck. He held her close, and he drew in a long, delicious breath tinged with the scent of her hair, her skin, her. \u201cMy Ellie of Aquitaine.\u201d</p><p>And then he had no choice but to let his Intended down, for there was an entire garrison of knights who wished to hug her\u2014the Dragonhawk himself, included, not to mention one special young knight in particular.</p> <p>\u201cJason!\u201d she exclaimed happily, and launched at the lad with more spirit than a fierce Welsh Wode maiden in battle.</p><p>To the lad\u2019s credit, he apparently had been awaiting her memory to return from the moment she left England. He caught her in full leap, and squeezed her thusly.</p><p>\u201cMy lady Ellie! I\u2019ve missed you!\u201d he said, and quickly found he\u2019d have to muse over fond memories at a later date.</p><p>Not only were there many a fierce knight about the great hall who stood rather impatiently to welcome Ellie home, but a skittish Nicklesby, who all but hopped about from one foot to the other, anxiously trying to worm his way into the crowd.</p><p>She spotted him and made a beeline for the wiry man. \u201cNicklesby! Oh, Nicklesby! Can you believe it?\u201d she asked as she all but snapped the skinny man\u2019s neck in twain with her fierce hug.</p> <p>Nicklesby hugged her back, unashamed tears welling up in his eyes. \u201c\u2019Tis a wondrous miracle, aye,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m powerfully glad to see you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove there, yon bothersome Grimm steward, and let me \u2019ave a word with the lass!\u201d</p><p>Ellie turned from Nicklesby\u2019s embrace and Gawan thought he\u2019d never get used to seeing such a beautiful smile light upon her face. \u201cSir Godfrey! Ladies!\u201d she said, as the three Grimm spirits floated toward her.</p><p>\u201cLady! What about me?\u201d</p><p>Through the crowd burst young Davy. To the dismay of several knights, the lad plowed through to get to Ellie. \u201cI\u2019m here!\u201d</p><p>Ellie laughed and bent over at the waist. \u201cAre you ready for another game of knucklebones?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost assuredly, aye!\u201d he said, just as a barking Cotswold shoved through the crowd, Nicklesby chasing after him.</p><p>Gawan\u2019s heart swelled as he watched his people embrace his woman. They\u2019d fast learned to love her as an In Betwixt spirit.</p><p>They loved her more as a very much alive and breathing woman. His woman.</p><p>And as Gawan moved through the throng of people, he pushed Jason aside and peeled Ellie from Tristan de Barre\u2019s arms. Gawan drew her close, and over the top of her head clashed gazes with three of the most wily beings ever to set foot in his hall.</p><p>Elgan, Fergus, and Aizeene gave a short nod, their broad, knowing smiles most satisfying indeed. They\u2019d acquired their own retirement, after all. He couldn\u2019t wait to properly introduce them to Ellie. Indeed, that would wait.</p><p>Moving his mouth to Ellie\u2019s ear, he first kissed the soft shell, felt her shiver, and then whispered, \u201cForgive me, girl, but this cannot wait.\u201d He kissed her lobe, and then whispered again, \u201cWed me, Ell. I vow, you\u2019ll not regret it.\u201d</p><p>Ellie slowly lifted her head and stared into his eyes.</p><p>The entire hall grew deathly silent.</p> <p>Gawan\u2019s heart ceased beating.</p><p>Then a wide smile split her face in twain. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><p>As Gawan pressed his mouth against Ellie\u2019s, their teeth clacked together as each one smiled. They laughed, but their laughter was quickly drowned out by the raucous cheering of the knights, ex-angels, and ghosts filling Grimm\u2019s great hall.</p><p>Overcome with happiness and love, Gawan took his wife-to-be even tighter within his arms and kissed her good, well, and true.</p><p>Aye. He\u2019d found her.</p><p>He glanced at Elgan, Fergus, Aizeene, now joined by Nicklesby. They stood grinning like fools. He owed them much.</p><p>With a bit of help, he\u2019d found his Intended.</p><p>And bleeding priests and saints above, he\u2019d not let her go again.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I smile at Gawan. \u201cI gotta admit. You medieval warlords make for some seriously romantic guys.\u201d I elbow him. \u201cSlick move in the mirror.\u201d</p><p>Gawan grins. \u201c\u2019Twasna planned, my lady. \u2019Twas fate.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI believe in that now,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd it\u2019s why I need you to walk me through what to do again if I find myself going after . . . an Earthbound, or anyone else who may be being held hostage in that otherworld.\u201d</p><p>Gawan looks at me and his eyes twinkle. \u201cVery well.\u201d He rubs his chin. \u201c\u2019Tisna here, in Edinburgh, though,\u201d he admits. \u201c\u2019Tis farther north. In the Highlands. St. Bueno\u2019s Well. Young Jason mentioned it to you before, aye? With the holy water. I was wondering when you\u2019d get around tae askin\u2019 me about it.\u201d</p><p>I search his brown eyes. \u201cYou just point me in the right direction, Grimm. I\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d</p><p>Back at the Crescent, I\u2019m packing my stuff. I pack up Eli\u2019s, too, and my eyes sting with tears. I sincerely don\u2019t believe he\u2019s dead. Not anymore. Vic either. But it\u2019s going to be Hell\u2014literally\u2014to save them both. I\u2019ll die trying.</p><p>Just then, a slight movement out of the corner of my eye catches my attention. Slowly, I turn. It\u2019s Lily. She\u2019s standing against the wall. Staring at me with those black fathomless orbs.</p><p>I smile at her. \u201cI\u2019ve got the scathe all packed and ready,\u201d I say to her. \u201cI\u2019m going to find Eli. And Victorian.\u201d I study her little ghostly figure. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The corner of her mouth tips up.</p><p>Grabbing my bags, I shoulder them, then reach into one. I withdraw the pouch of hoodoo herbs for protection and set it on the dresser. I smile at Lily. \u201cFor you. Just in case you need it.\u201d</p><p>Lily turns her head and stares at it.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>I turn my head to find Noah at the door. When I look back at Lily, she\u2019s gone.</p><p>So is the bag of herbs.</p><p>How she pulled that off I\u2019ll never know. But I\u2019m glad as hell she decided to show herself to me.</p><p>I stare out the window as the plane ascends, leaving Edinburgh behind. Beneath. Whatever.</p><p>It\u2019s more than leaving Edinburgh. I feel as though I\u2019m leaving Eli behind, too. And Vic.</p><p>And I guess I am. Sort of. But not really, according to Gawan.</p><p>Leaning my forehead against the double-paned glass, I stare into the clouds. What\u2019s real anymore? What\u2019s really out there? Do any of us know for sure? And how in the holy Hell do I get my head back in the game without Eli?</p><p>Strong fingers slip through my hair and squeeze my neck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll make it through this,\u201d Noah says, mercury eyes sincere. His lips tip in a solemn smile. \u201cI make it my solemn vow to see you make it through this.\u201d</p><p>I give a slight smile. \u201cThanks, Noah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he says, and pulls me close. \u201cWe\u2019re in a plane with two werewolves, four immortal druids, and another vampire besides myself. We\u2019re heading into a were-war. We need you, Riley.\u201d He looks at me hard. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>I meet his stare and it comforts me. \u201cI know. I\u2019m here, Noah. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d I glance out over the jagged cliffs that peer through the misty clouds. We\u2019re headed to the Highlands. Inverness, and into wolf country.</p><p>Werewolf country.</p><p>And, yeah, there\u2019s a war raging between the clans, and it ain\u2019t purty. Only I won\u2019t be joining them. Not right away, that is. I\u2019ve got a mystical well to visit first. St. Bueno\u2019s. I pray it holds the answers I\u2019m looking for, so once we land in Inverness, I\u2019ll be taking off. Alone.</p><p>Eli would want me to be strong, stay safe.</p><p>I\u2019ll do my very best.</p><p>Just as my eyes drift shut, a voice interrupts my thoughts. It\u2019s familiar, achingly so.</p><p>Your men may still be alive, but you\u2019ll have to go after them. I canna promise they are there. Riley Poe. Be careful . . .</p><p>My eyes dart around the plane, and I search all faces. No one else has a voice like that besides Athios.</p><p>Who was supposed to die with the Seiagh.</p><p>What the?</p><p>Where? I ask.</p><p>You\u2019re headed in the right direction. You\u2019ll know it when you see it. Hallowed ground, oldest in Scotia. Tell no one. You\u2019ve got to do this alone. . . . </p> </body></html>"]
