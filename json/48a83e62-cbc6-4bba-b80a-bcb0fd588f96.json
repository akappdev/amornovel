Gazing steadily ahead, Vaughn Kyle barreled down the freeway just outside Grand Forks. Within a few miles, the four lanes had narrowed to two. Dreary, dirt-smudged snow lay piled up along both sides of the highway. Fresh snow had begun to fall, pristine and bright, glinting in the late-afternoon sun.</p><p>His parents had retired earlier in the year, leaving Denver, where Vaughn had been born and raised, and returning to the state they\u2019d left long ago. They\u2019d moved north, away from the majestic peaks of the Rocky Mountains to the endlessly boring landscape of the Dakotas. This was supposed to be beautiful? Maybe in summer, he mused, when the fields of grain rippled with the wind, acre after acre. Now, though, in December, in the dead of winter, the beauty of this place escaped him. All that was visible was a winding stretch of black asphalt cutting through flat, monotonous terrain that stretched for miles in every direction.</p><p>After seven years as an Airborne Ranger in the U.S. Army\u2019s Second Battalion based in Fort Lewis, Washington, Vaughn was poised to begin the second stage of his working life. He had his discharge papers and he\u2019d recently been hired by Value-X, a mega-retailer with headquarters in Seattle. Value-X was one of America\u2019s most notable success stories. New stores were opening every day all across the United States and Canada.</p> <p>His course was set for the future, thanks largely to Natalie Nichols. They\u2019d met two years earlier through mutual friends. Natalie was smart, savvy and ambitious; Value-X had recognized her skills and she\u2019d advanced quickly, being promoted to a vice presidency before the age of thirty.</p><p>Vaughn had been attracted by her dedication and purpose, and he\u2019d admired her ambition. His own work ethic was strong; as he\u2019d come to realize, that was increasingly rare in this age of quick fixes and no-fault living. Natalie was the one who\u2019d convinced him to leave the army. He was ready. When he\u2019d enlisted after finishing college, he\u2019d done so intending to make the military his career. In the seven years since, he\u2019d learned the advantages and drawbacks of soldiering.</p><p>He didn\u2019t mind the regimented life, but the career possibilities weren\u2019t all he\u2019d hoped they would be. What he lacked, as Natalie had pointed out, was opportunity. He was limited in how far he could rise through the ranks or how quickly, while the private sector was wide-open and looking for promising employees like him. He\u2019d been interviewed by three headhunters who recruited candidates for a variety of corporations and in just a few weeks had six job offers.</p><p>At first he\u2019d felt there might be a conflict of interest, taking a position with the same company as Natalie. However, she didn\u2019t view it that way; they would be a team, she\u2019d told Vaughn, and with that remarkable persuasive skill of hers had convinced him to come on board. He wouldn\u2019t officially start until after the first of the year, but he was already on assignment.</p><p>Value-X was buying property in Buffalo Valley, North Dakota. Since Vaughn was going to be in the vicinity, visiting his parents in nearby Grand Forks, Natalie had asked him to pay the town a visit. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for a community to put up token resistance to the company\u2019s arrival. In most cases, any negative publicity was successfully handled, using a proven strategy that included barraging the local media with stories showing the company\u2019s \u201chuman face.\u201d After a recent public-relations disaster in Montana, Natalie was eager to avoid a repeat. She\u2019d asked Vaughn to do a \u201cclimate check\u201d in Buffalo Valley, but it was important, she insisted, that he not let anyone know he was now a Value-X employee, not even his parents. Vaughn had reluctantly agreed.</p> <p>He\u2019d done this because he trusted Natalie\u2019s judgment. And because he was in love with her. They\u2019d talked about marriage, although she seemed hesitant. Her reasons for postponing it were logical, presented in her usual no-nonsense manner. She refused to be \u201csubservient to emotion,\u201d as she called it, and Vaughn was impressed by her clear-cut vision of what she wanted and how to achieve it. They\u2019d get married when the time was right for both of them.</p><p>He was eager to have her meet his family. Natalie would be joining him on December twenty-seventh, but he wished she could\u2019ve rearranged her schedule to travel with him.</p><p>On this cold Friday afternoon two weeks before Christmas, Vaughn had decided to drive into Buffalo Valley. Because of Hassie Knight, he didn\u2019t need to invent an excuse for his parents. Hassie was the mother of his namesake. She\u2019d lost her only son\u2014his parents\u2019 closest friend\u2014in Vietnam three years before Vaughn was born. Every birthday, until he\u2019d reached the age of twenty-one, Hassie had mailed him a letter with a twenty-five-dollar U.S. Savings Bond.</p><p>In all that time, he\u2019d never met her. From first grade on, he\u2019d dutifully sent her a thank-you note for every gift. That was the extent of their contact, but he still felt a genuine fondness for her\u2014and gratitude. Hassie had been the one to start him on a savings program. As a young adult Vaughn had cashed in those savings bonds and begun acquiring a portfolio of stocks that over the years had become a hefty nest egg.</p><p>An hour after he left Grand Forks, Vaughn slowed his speed, certain that if he blinked he might miss Buffalo Valley entirely. Value-X could put this place on the map. That was one benefit the company offered small towns. He wasn\u2019t sure what kind of business community existed in Buffalo Valley. He knew about Knight\u2019s Pharmacy of course, because Hassie owned that. Apparently the town was large enough to have its own cemetery, too; Hassie had mailed him a picture of her son\u2019s gravesite years earlier.</p><p>Buffalo Valley was directly off the road. You didn\u2019t take an exit the way you would in most places. You just drove off the highway. He slowed, made a right turn where the road sign indicated. The car pitched as it left the pavement and hit ruts in the frozen dirt road. He\u2019d gone at least a hundred feet before the paved road resumed.</p> <p>He passed a few scattered houses, and as he turned the corner, he discovered, somewhat to his surprise, a main street with businesses lining both sides. There was even a hotel of sorts, called Buffalo Bob\u2019s 3 of a Kind. The bank building, a sprawling brick structure, seemed new and quite extensive. This was amazing. He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d expected, but nothing like this. Buffalo Valley was a real town, not a cluster of run-down houses and boarded-up stores, like some of the prairie towns his parents had told him about.</p><p>Hassie\u2019s store caught his attention next. It was a quaint, old-fashioned pharmacy, with big picture windows and large white lettering. Christmas lights framed the window, flashing alternately red and green. In smaller letters below KNIGHT\u2019S PHARMACY, a soda fountain was advertised. Vaughn hadn\u2019t tasted a real soda made with hand-scooped ice cream and flavored syrup since his childhood.</p><p>He parked, climbed out of his rental car and stood on the sidewalk, glancing around. This was a decent-size town, decorated for the holidays with festive displays in nearly every window. A city park could be seen in the distance, and the Buffalo Valley Quilting Company appeared to take up a large portion of the block across the street. He remembered an article about it in the file Natalie had given him.</p><p>The cold stung his face and snow swirled around him. Rather than stand there risking frostbite, Vaughn walked into the pharmacy. The bell above the door jingled and he was instantly greeted by a blast of heat that chased the chill from his bones.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d He couldn\u2019t see who spoke, but the voice sounded young, so he assumed it wasn\u2019t Hassie. The woman or girl, whoever she was, stood behind the raised counter at the back of the store.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Hassie Knight,\u201d Vaughn called, edging his way down the narrow aisle. This pharmacy apparently carried everything: cosmetics, greeting cards, over-the-counter medicine, gourmet chocolate, toothpaste and tissues\u2014just about anything you might require.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hassie\u2019s out for the day. Can I be of help?\u201d</p><p>He supposed he didn\u2019t need to see Hassie, although it would have been nice.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m Carrie Hendrickson.\u201d A petite blonde in a white jacket materialized before him, hand extended. \u201cI\u2019m an intern working with Hassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaughn Kyle,\u201d he said, stretching out his own hand. He liked the way her eyes squarely met his. Her expression held a hint of suspicion, but Vaughn was prepared for that. Natalie had mentioned the North Dakota attitude toward strangers\u2014a wariness that ranged from mild doubt to outright hostility. It was one reason she worried about this proposed building site.</p><p>\u201cHassie and I have never officially met, but she does know me,\u201d he added reassuringly. \u201cI was named after her son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the Vaughn Kyle?\u201d she asked, her voice revealing excitement now. \u201cDid Hassie know you were coming and completely forget? I can\u2019t imagine her doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, it was nothing like that. I just happened to be in the area and thought I\u2019d stop by and introduce myself.\u201d</p><p>Her suspicion evaporated and was replaced with a wide, welcoming smile. \u201cI\u2019m so pleased to meet you. Hassie will be thrilled.\u201d She gestured to the counter. \u201cCan I get you anything? Coffee? A soft drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I wouldn\u2019t mind an old-fashioned soda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re Hassie\u2019s specialty, but I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d On second thought, he decided something warm might be preferable. \u201cI\u2019ll have a coffee.\u201d</p><p>She led him to the soda fountain and Vaughn sat on a padded stool while Carrie ducked beneath the counter and reappeared on the other side.</p><p>\u201cDo you know when Hassie\u2019s due back?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAround six,\u201d Carrie told him, lifting the glass pot and filling his cup. \u201cYou need space for cream?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He answered with a quick shake of his head. She didn\u2019t cut off the steady stream of weak coffee until it\u2019d reached the very brim of his cup.</p><p>The door opened, bells jingling, and a woman dressed in a black leather jacket walked into the store. She had three scarves wrapped around her neck, nearly obscuring her face.</p><p>\u201cHi, Merrily,\u201d Carrie called, then scrambled under the fountain barrier. \u201cI\u2019ll have Bobby\u2019s prescription ready in just a moment.\u201d She hurried to the back of the store. \u201cWhile you\u2019re waiting, introduce yourself to Vaughn Kyle.\u201d</p><p>Merrily glanced toward the counter and waved, and Vaughn raised his mug to her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Hassie\u2019s Vaughn Kyle,\u201d Carrie said emphatically. \u201cVaughn was named after her son,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you say so?\u201d Merrily walked over to shake his hand. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked, unwinding the woolen scarves.</p><p>Now, that was an interesting question, Vaughn thought. He certainly hadn\u2019t anticipated anyone knowing about him.</p><p>\u201cHe came to meet Hassie,\u201d Carrie said as she returned with the prescription. She handed Merrily a small white sack. \u201cHow\u2019s Bobby feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter, I think. Poor little guy seems prone to ear infections.\u201d She turned to Vaughn with a smile. \u201cNice meeting you,\u201d she said. She wrapped the mufflers around her face again before she headed out the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou, too,\u201d Vaughn murmered.</p><p>Carrie reached across the counter and grabbed a second mug for herself. \u201cHassie told you about the War Memorial, didn\u2019t she? We\u2019re all proud of that.\u201d Not waiting for a response, she continued, \u201cThe town built the Memorial three years ago, and it honors everyone from Buffalo Valley who died in war. The only one most of us actually remember is Hassie\u2019s son. But there were others. We lost Harvey Schmidt in the Korean War and five men in World War II, but none of their families live in the area anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew Vaughn Knight?\u201d The blonde seemed far too young to have known Hassie\u2019s son.</p><p>\u201cNot personally. But from the time I was small, Hassie told my brothers and me about Vaughn. It\u2019s been her mission to make sure he isn\u2019t forgotten.\u201d</p> <p>Vaughn had heard about Vaughn Knight from his own parents of course, since they\u2019d both been close to Hassie\u2019s son.</p><p>Carrie sipped her coffee. \u201cHassie told me it was one of the greatest honors of her life that your parents chose to remember her son through you.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn nodded, disappointed that he\u2019d missed meeting the older woman. \u201cWhat time did you say Hassie would be back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround six, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn checked his watch. He didn\u2019t intend to make an entire day of this.</p> <p>\u201cIf Hassie had known you were coming, I don\u2019t think anything could\u2019ve kept her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should have phoned beforehand,\u201d he muttered. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn glanced at his watch again. Three hours was far longer than he wanted to stick around. \u201cTell her I\u2019ll come by some other time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease stay. Hassie would feel terrible if she learned you\u2019d left without meeting her.\u201d She hesitated, obviously thinking. \u201cListen,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll phone Leta Betts and ask if she can fill in for me for a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn reconsidered. He might get all the information he needed from Carrie; then he could meet Hassie on strictly social terms. He\u2019d been vaguely uncomfortable about questioning Hassie, anyway.</p> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, \u201cit would mean the world to Hassie, and I\u2019d be delighted to give you a tour of town.\u201d</p><p>Perfect. He\u2019d learn everything Natalie wanted to know and more. \u201cThat\u2019s a generous offer. Are you sure you don\u2019t mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d consider it a pleasure,\u201d she said, and smiled.</p><p>With her looking up at him that way, smiling and appreciative, Vaughn couldn\u2019t help noticing that Carrie Hendrickson was a very attractive woman. Not that Natalie had anything to worry about, he told himself staunchly.</p><p>Working closely with Hassie as an intern pharmacist, Carrie Hendrickson was keenly aware of how eager the older woman was to meet her son\u2019s namesake. A few months ago, Hassie had heard that the Kyles had retired in Grand Forks and she\u2019d mailed off a note, inviting them to visit Buffalo Valley. Apparently they planned to do that sometime in the new year. Hassie would be ecstatic about finally meeting their son.</p><p>Carrie loved Hassie Knight, who was her mentor and her friend. Following Carrie\u2019s divorce, Hassie had given her sympathy\u2014and good, brisk, commonsense advice. She\u2019d guided her through the fog of her pain and encouraged her to look toward the future. Many an afternoon they\u2019d spent talking, reminiscing, sitting quietly together. Hassie had shared the grief of her own losses and helped Carrie deal with Alec\u2019s betrayal in ways her own mother never could. Hassie was the person who\u2019d suggested she return to college. Carrie had taken her advice; nearly six years ago she\u2019d enrolled at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. Now she was about to finish her internship with Knight\u2019s Pharmacy and achieve her Pharm.D and become a Doctor of Pharmacy. The last few years had been bleak financially, but the reward would be worth all the sacrifices.</p><p>After her divorce, she\u2019d moved back in with her parents. She felt deeply grateful for their generosity but she was twenty-seven years old and longed for more independence and a home of her own. Well, it would happen eventually; she\u2019d just have to wait.</p><p>Meanwhile, working side by side with Hassie, Carrie had learned a great deal. When it came time for the older woman to retire, Carrie would be willing and able to assume her role in the pharmacy and in the town. People knew and trusted her. Already they approached her with their troubles and concerns as naturally as they did Hassie. Alec\u2019s infidelity had reinforced the importance of trust and honor for Carrie. Those were precepts she lived by. The people of Buffalo Valley knew she would keep their problems to herself.</p> <p>The town was a success story in an area where there\u2019d been few. The Hendrickson farm, like many others, had fallen victim to low crop prices. Unable to make a living farming the land that had supported them for three generations, her father had leased the acreage to his older sons and moved into town. Together with Carrie\u2019s two younger brothers, he\u2019d opened a hardware store.</p><p>For as long as she could remember, Knight\u2019s Pharmacy had been the very heart of this town. Hassie was getting on in years and probably should\u2019ve retired long ago. She wouldn\u2019t, though, not while the community still needed her, not only to dispense prescriptions and basic medical advice but also to be their counselor and confidante.</p><p>Carrie knew she could never replace Hassie, because that would be impossible. But she\u2019d always been good at chemistry and math, and had done well at her pharmaceutical studies. She also cared about the town and had an intense interest in people. Hassie had often told her she was naturally intuitive and sensitive toward others; Carrie was pleased by that, although her intuition had been notably absent during her ex-husband\u2019s affair. Hassie said she was exactly the pharmacist Buffalo Valley needed and had given her the faith in herself to believe she could complete the six years of schooling required to obtain her license.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get my coat and hat and be right back,\u201d she told Vaughn after calling Leta. Hassie\u2019s friend worked at the pharmacy part-time and was as eager as Carrie to make sure that Hassie met Vaughn.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain this isn\u2019t an imposition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely certain,\u201d she told him.</p><p>Leta arrived promptly and after making swift introductions, Carrie removed the white pharmacist\u2019s jacket and put on her long wool coat.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like to see first?\u201d she asked when she rejoined him.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you\u2019d like to show me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go to the City Park.\u201d Although there were a number of places she wanted to take him, the park seemed the best place to start. As they left the pharmacy, Carrie noticed it had stopped snowing, but she suspected the temperature had dropped several degrees. She led him across the street and then down a block, past the quilt store and several others.</p><p>\u201cI know Hassie would want you to see the War Memorial,\u201d she said, glancing up at Vaughn. Now that she stood beside him, she was surprised to see how tall he was\u2014possibly six-two. All four of her brothers were six feet, but Carrie took after her mother\u2019s side of the family and was small-boned and petite. His dark good looks didn\u2019t escape her notice, either.</p><p>\u201cFirst came the park,\u201d she explained, walking briskly to ward off the cold. Carrie loved the City Park and everything it said about their community. The people of Buffalo Valley had worked together to make this barren plot of land a place of which to be proud. \u201cThe land itself was a gift from Lily Quantrill,\u201d she said. \u201cHeath Quantrill, her grandson, is the president of Buffalo Valley Bank.\u201d She pointed toward the brick structure at the far end of Main Street.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there a branch in Grand Forks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are branches all across the state,\u201d Carrie told him.</p><p>\u201cThe headquarters is here?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHeath moved everything to Buffalo Valley two years ago. I know it was a hard decision, but this is his home now, and he was tired of commuting to Grand Forks three days a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an impressive building.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeath\u2019s an impressive bank president. I hope you get the chance to meet him and his wife, Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too,\u201d Vaughn said.</p><p>\u201cHeath donated the lumber for the children\u2019s play equipment,\u201d she said as they entered the park and strolled past the jungle gym, slides and swings. \u201cBut Brandon Wyatt, along with Jeb McKenna and Gage Sinclair, actually built all these things.\u201d She realized the names didn\u2019t mean anything to Vaughn, but she wanted him to get a sense of what the park stood for in this community. Each family had contributed something, from planting the grass to laying the concrete walkway.</p><p>\u201cIt looks well used.\u201d</p><p>An outsider like Vaughn couldn\u2019t possibly understand how much the children of Buffalo Valley cherished the park. \u201cMy family owns the hardware,\u201d she continued, pointing to the opposite side of the park toward the store. \u201cWe donated the wood for the picnic tables.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI notice they aren\u2019t secured with chains,\u201d Vaughn said.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have much crime in Buffalo Valley.\u201d It distressed her to visit public areas where everything, including picnic tables and garbage cans, was tied down by chains to prevent theft. But no one had ever stolen from the park or any other public place in Buffalo Valley. There\u2019d never been any real vandalism, either.</p><p>\u201cNo crime?\u201d He sounded as though he didn\u2019t believe her.</p><p>\u201cWell, some, but it\u2019s mostly petty stuff. A few windows soaped at Halloween, that kind of thing. The occasional fight or display of drunkenness. We did have a murder once, about eighty years ago. According to the stories, it was a crime of passion.\u201d Quickly changing the subject, she said, \u201cThe War Memorial was designed by Kevin Betts. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard of him, but he was born and raised right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I haven\u2019t,\u201d Vaughn said with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s Leta\u2019s son, and he\u2019s an artist who\u2019s making a name for himself.\u201d Everyone in town was proud of Kevin. \u201cThis sculpture\u2014\u201d she gestured as they neared it \u201c\u2014was one of his very first.\u201d She watched Vaughn\u2019s expression when he saw it and was stirred by the immediate appreciation that showed in his eyes.</p><p>Kevin was a gifted artist, not only because he was technically skilled but because his work evoked emotion in people. The bronze sculpture was simple and yet profound. Half-a-dozen rifles were stacked together, upright and leaning against one another, with a helmet balanced on top. Beside the guns a young soldier knelt, his shoulders bowed in grief. No one seeing the piece could fail to be moved, to respond with sorrow and a bittersweet pain.</p><p>Vaughn stood before the memorial and didn\u2019t say anything right away. Then he squatted down and ran his finger over the name of Vaughn Knight. \u201cMy parents still talk about him. He was the one who brought them together,\u201d Vaughn said, and slowly straightened. \u201cI\u2019m glad he won\u2019t be forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be,\u201d Carrie assured him. \u201cWith this memorial, his name will always be here to remind everyone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Vaughn thrust his gloved hands into his coat pockets.</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d Carrie asked.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI know about the pharmacy and you\u2019ve mentioned the hardware store. Tell me about the other businesses in town.\u201d</p><p>They walked toward Main Street and Carrie told him about each one in turn, starting with Joanie Wyatt\u2019s video-rental and craft store and ending with her parents\u2019 place.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a leap of faith for you to move into town, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Vaughn said.</p><p>Carrie nodded pensively. \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s paid off. My two oldest brothers are still farming and the two younger ones work exclusively with Mom and Dad. It\u2019s a good arrangement all around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d Vaughn asked unexpectedly.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou offering to feed me?\u201d It was a bit early, but dinner would pass the time until Hassie returned.</p><p>\u201cUnless there\u2019s a reason for you to hurry home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo reason. I\u2019m divorced.\u201d Even now, six years later, the words left a bitter taste on her tongue. She focused her gaze directly in front of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI am, too.\u201d She forced a cheerful note into her voice, as if to say she was over it.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d suggest Buffalo Bob\u2019s 3 of a Kind. I was intrigued by what you told me about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s certainly a character,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut before we go there, I\u2019d like to show you Maddy\u2019s Grocery.\u201d Carrie loved the wonderful and witty Christmas display Maddy put up every year. Eight reindeer were suspended from the ceiling, with the front half of Santa\u2019s sleigh coming out of the wall.</p><p>Vaughn laughed when he saw it. His reaction was one of genuine enjoyment and not the short derisive laugh of someone mocking Maddy\u2019s efforts. On their way to 3 of a Kind, they strolled past the Buffalo Valley Quilting Company.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the success story of the decade,\u201d Carrie boasted as she motioned to the holiday quilt displayed in the first set of windows. \u201cSarah Urlacher started the business in her father\u2019s house, dyeing the muslin herself from all-natural products. The designs are her own, too.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn stopped to look at the quilt in the window.</p><p>\u201cIt all began when Lindsay Sinclair introduced Sarah\u2019s quilts to her uncle. He owns an upscale furniture store in Atlanta, and before she knew it, Sarah had trouble keeping up with the demand. Now people all over the country buy her quilts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah\u2019s business has boosted the economy of Buffalo Valley to the point that we can now afford things that are commonplace in other towns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sidewalks got refurbished last summer, and the town could never have paid for that without the tax revenue Sarah\u2019s business brings in.\u201d Carrie didn\u2019t mention the new community well and several other improvements that had taken place over the past few years.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let Leta know where we are so she can tell Hassie,\u201d Carrie said, and made a quick stop at the pharmacy. She was back within moments. Vaughn waited for her outside.</p> <p>There was no one at the restaurant or in the bar when they arrived. Studying Buffalo Bob with fresh eyes, Carrie could only guess what Vaughn must think. The ex-biker was a burly man. He was an oddity here in a town where most men came off the farm. With his thinning hair drawn back into a ponytail and his muscular arms covered in tattoos, he looked as though he\u2019d be more comfortable with a biker gang than waiting tables.</p><p>\u201cHow ya doin\u2019, Carrie?\u201d he greeted her when she took a seat across the table from Vaughn.</p><p>\u201cGood, Bob. Come meet Vaughn Kyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Buffalo Valley,\u201d Bob said, extending his hand for a hearty shake. \u201cMerrily told me you\u2019d dropped by.\u201d Bob gave them each a menu. \u201cTake a look, but the special tonight is Salisbury steak. I don\u2019t mind telling you it\u2019s excellent.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd who would know better than me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m convinced,\u201d Vaughn told him with an answering smile. \u201cI\u2019ll have the special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Carrie said, returning the menu.</p><p>Bob left them, and Carrie tried to relax but found it difficult. She hadn\u2019t been alone with a man, other than her brothers, in a very long time. Following her divorce, she\u2019d only dated twice, and both occasions had been awkward. Her schooling, plus her internship, didn\u2019t leave much room for a social life, anyway.</p><p>Vaughn sat back in his chair. \u201cTell me about Hassie,\u201d he suggested easily.</p><p>Carrie felt the tightness leave her shoulders. On the subject of Hassie, she could talk his ear off. \u201cWhat would you like to know first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you feel is important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been my hero for as long as I can remember. I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve happened to this town without her.\u201d Carrie wanted him to realize how deeply Hassie was loved by everyone in Buffalo Valley. \u201cShe\u2019s older now, and she\u2019s slowing down some.\u201d Carrie had seen the evidence of that in the months since she\u2019d come to work as an intern. She almost suspected that Hassie had been holding on until she got there.</p><p>Vaughn glanced at Buffalo Bob as he brought their salads and nodded his thanks. \u201cEvery year, along with my birthday card and a U.S. Savings Bond, she wrote me a short message.\u201d His mouth lifted in a half smile. \u201cShe called it words to live by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me an example,\u201d Carrie said, curious.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember them all, but...okay, she told me about the importance of being on time. Only, she did it by making up this little poem....\u201d He hesitated and a slow grin crossed his face. \u201cShe once wrote that if at first I don\u2019t succeed, it just means I\u2019m normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like Hassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a wonderful way of putting things.\u201d He paused, a reflective look on his face. \u201cWhen I was sixteen, she told me the grass isn\u2019t greener on the other side of the fence, it\u2019s greener where it\u2019s watered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful that you remembered them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I not, when she made them so much fun? She was like an extra grandmother.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that warmed Carrie\u2019s heart, because she knew Hassie felt toward him the way she would a grandson.</p><p>They were silent as they ate their salads. Buffalo Bob had made even a plain lettuce, cucumber and tomato salad taste delicious with the addition of a tart-sweet cranberry dressing. They were just finishing when Bob reappeared, carrying two plates heaped with food. He placed them in front of Vaughn and Carrie, then stepped back, and said, \u201cEnjoy.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn stared after him as he returned to the kitchen. \u201cHe\u2019s not the typical sort of person you find in a place like this, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBob\u2019s a sweetheart,\u201d she said defensively. \u201cHe\u2019s hardworking and well-liked and a wonderful father and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me how he happened to land in Buffalo Valley,\u201d Vaughn broke in. He reached for his fork, tasting the fluffy mashed potatoes and tender gravy-covered steak.</p><p>\u201cHe came here when the town was at its lowest point. My uncle Earl owned this hotel and he\u2019d been trying to sell it for years. Seeing that there weren\u2019t any buyers and he was losing money every month, my uncle devised an unusual poker game. It cost a thousand dollars to play, but the winner walked away with the hotel, restaurant and bar. Lock, stock and barrel.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn\u2019s brows arched. \u201cAnd Bob won it with three of a kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn shook his head. \u201cMore power to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot has changed since then, all of it for the better. Bob married Merrily, and two and a half years ago, they had little Bobby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one who\u2019s prone to ear infections?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou\u2019ve never seen better parents. Those two dote on that little boy something fierce. In fact, Bob and Merrily are terrific with all the kids in town.\u201d Carrie paused long enough to sample her dinner. \u201cHey, this is terrific.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn agreed with her. \u201cIn addition to his other talents, Buffalo Bob\u2019s a good cook. He wasn\u2019t kidding about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what his life was like before he came to Buffalo Valley, but he\u2019s one of us now.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn was about to ask a question when the door opened and Hassie hurried inside.</p><p>Carrie was instantly on her feet. One look told her Hassie was exhausted. Her shoulders were slumped and she seemed close to collapse.</p><p>\u201cHassie,\u201d Carrie said, wrapping her arm protectively around the older woman\u2019s waist. \u201cThis is Vaughn Kyle.\u201d</p><p>It was almost as if Hassie didn\u2019t hear her at first. \u201cVaughn,\u201d she repeated, and then her face brightened visibly. \u201cMy goodness, did you let me know you were coming and it slipped my mind?\u201d</p><p>Vaughn pulled out a chair for her to sit down. \u201cNo, I very rudely showed up without an invitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no problem. Carrie was kind enough to spend the afternoon with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me take a good look at you,\u201d Hassie said. She cupped his face with both hands and a smile emerged. \u201cYou\u2019re so handsome,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou have such kind eyes.\u201d</p><p>If her praise embarrassed or flustered him, Vaughn didn\u2019t reveal it.</p><p>\u201cHow long can you stay?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cActually, I should probably think about heading back to Grand Forks soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Hassie protested. \u201cThat\u2019s hardly enough time for me to show you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie already gave me a tour of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, but I have a number of things I\u2019ve saved that I\u2019d like you to have\u2014things that were my son\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Her disappointment was unmistakeable, and Carrie glanced at Vaughn, trying to signal him, hoping he\u2019d change his mind.</p><p>\u201cI want to see them.\u201d</p><p>Carrie could have hugged him right then and there.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cyou\u2019ve had a long, tiring day. Perhaps it would be better if I came back later.\u201d</p><p>Hassie didn\u2019t bother to deny what was obvious. \u201cWould it be too much to ask you to come here on Sunday?\u201d Both her hands gripped his, as if she was afraid to let him go.</p><p>Carrie found herself just as eager to hear his response.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the store shortly after noon,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to seeing you then.\u201d</p><p>Carrie felt a surge of relief\u2014and anticipation. She couldn\u2019t help smiling, first at Hassie, then at Vaughn.</p><p>Happiness shimmered in the old woman\u2019s eyes as she placed one hand on Carrie\u2019s shoulder and leaned heavily against her.</p><p>\u201cThat would be perfect,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cThank you, Vaughn.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Hassie felt old and weary, especially after a day like this. But God had rewarded her patience by sending Vaughn Kyle to Buffalo Valley. Seeing him, however briefly, had lifted her spirits. Best of all was his promise to return on Sunday afternoon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tired though she was, Hassie brewed herself a cup of tea and sat at her kitchen table, mulling over the events of the day. Ambrose Kohn had been a thorn in her side for many years. His family had lived and worked in town for generations, but with impeccable timing, the Kohns had moved to Devils Lake just before the economy in Buffalo Valley collapsed.</p><p>Ambrose owned several pieces of property here and a building or two. The theater belonged to him, and he\u2019d been quick enough to close it down, despite the town council\u2019s efforts to convince him otherwise. The old building still had plenty of life in it, but it\u2019d sat abandoned and neglected until the first year Lindsay Snyder came to Buffalo Valley as the high-school teacher. She\u2019d wanted to use it for a Christmas play. If Hassie remembered correctly, Ambrose had demanded she go out with him first before he gave permission. That annoyed Hassie even now, several years later.</p><p>Lindsay had attended some social function with Ambrose, and it had nearly ruined her relationship with Gage Sinclair. But she and Gage had resolved their differences.They\u2019d been married for more than five years now and were parents of two beautiful daughters.</p><p>Ambrose, despite his underhanded methods, had walked away a winner, as well. After the community had cleaned up that old theater and put on the high-school Christmas program, he\u2019d reopened the movie house and it\u2019d been in operation ever since.</p> <p>Unfortunately Ambrose hadn\u2019t learned anything from that experience. He hadn\u2019t learned that people in Buffalo Valley loved their town and that they supported one another. He hadn\u2019t figured out that for them, Buffalo Valley was home, not just a place to live. Now the middle-aged bachelor held the fate of the community in his hands. Value-X, a huge retailer, wanted to move into town and they wanted to set up shop on land owned by Ambrose. The company had a reputation for sweeping into small towns and then systematically destroying independent and family-owned businesses. Six months earlier, Hassie had watched a television report on the effect the mega-retailer had on communities. At the time she\u2019d never dreamed Buffalo Valley might be targeted. Naturally the company insisted this was progress and a boon to the town\u2019s economy. There were already articles in some of the regional papers, touting the company\u2019s supposedly civic-minded attitudes. Profit-minded was more like it.</p><p>No one needed to tell Hassie what would happen to Buffalo Valley if Value-X decided to follow through with its plans. All the small businesses that had recently started would die a fast and painful death. Her own pharmacy wouldn\u2019t be immune.</p><p>Ambrose owned twenty acres just outside of town; this was the property Value-X was interested in acquiring, and he wasn\u2019t opposed to selling it\u2014no matter how badly it damaged the community.</p><p>Nothing Hassie said had the least bit of impact on him. Buffalo Bob, as president of the town council, had tried to reason with him, too, again without success. Heath Quantrill had thrown up his hands in frustration at the man\u2019s stubborn refusal to listen.</p><p>While Ambrose didn\u2019t live in Buffalo Valley, he did have a powerful influence on its future. For that reason alone, he should think carefully about his decision to sell that parcel of land. Progress or not, it wasn\u2019t the kind of future she or anyone here saw for Buffalo Valley. Jerry, her husband, might have been able to talk sense into Ambrose, but Jerry had died the year after Vaughn. She\u2019d lost them both so close together.</p> <p>The TV report on Value-X had made a strong impression on Hassie. What had stayed in her mind most clearly were the interviews with business owners, some with three- and four-generation histories. They\u2019d been forced to close down, unable to compete. Local traditions had been lost, pride broken. Men and women wept openly, in despair and hopelessness. Downtown areas died out.</p><p>Hassie couldn\u2019t bear to think what would happen to Buffalo Valley if Ambrose sold that land to those outsiders. Why, it would undo all the work the town council had done over the past six years. The outcome was too dismal to consider.</p><p>Joanie Wyatt\u2019s video-rental and craft store would probably be one of the first to fold. And the Hendricksons\u2014they\u2019d sunk everything they had in this world and more into AceMan Hardware. Value-X would undercut the lowest prices they could charge and ring the store\u2019s death knell for sure.</p><p>Dennis Urlacher supplied car parts to the community at his filling station. Although that was only a small portion of his business, Dennis had once mentioned that his largest profit margin came from the auto parts and not the fuel. It wouldn\u2019t be long before his business was affected, too. Even Rachel Quantrill\u2019s new hamburger stand would lose customers. Maddy\u2019s Grocery would suffer, too; how long she\u2019d be able to hold on depended on Value-X\u2019s plans. It was said that many of the newer stores included groceries.</p><p>None of that concerned Ambrose. All he knew was that he\u2019d been offered a fair price for a piece of land that had sat vacant for years. He\u2019d let it be known that he fully intended to sell those acres. If anyone else was interested, he\u2019d entertain other offers. Ambrose had made one thing perfectly clear: the offer had to be substantially higher than the deal Value-X had proposed. No one in town, not even Heath Quantrill, had a thick-enough bankroll to get into a bidding war with the huge retailer.</p><p>Hassie sipped her tea and purposely turned her thoughts in a more pleasant direction. What a fine-looking young man Vaughn Kyle was. After all these years, she was grateful to finally meet him. His letters had meant so much to her, and she\u2019d saved each thank-you note from the time he was six years old.</p> <p>For a short while after her son was buried, Hassie and Barbara, the boy\u2019s mother, had been close. They\u2019d stayed in touch, but then a year later the wedding announcement arrived. Barbara, the beautiful young woman her son had loved, was marrying Rick Kyle, who\u2019d been one of Vaughn\u2019s best friends.</p><p>Hassie didn\u2019t begrudge the couple happiness, but she hadn\u2019t attended the wedding. Their marriage was a painful reminder that life continues. If circumstances had been different, this might have been her own son\u2019s wedding.</p><p>Two years later, Rick and Barbara had mailed her the birth announcement. They\u2019d named their first child after Hassie\u2019s son. Two years later came another birth announcement, this time for a girl they named Gloria. Sight unseen, Hassie had loved that boy and thought of him as the grandson Vaughn could never give her. Her own daughter, Valerie, had two girls and Hassie adored them, but since Val and her family lived in Hawaii, there was little opportunity to see them. Vaughn Kyle had assumed a special significance for her. Neither his parents nor anyone else knew how deep her feelings ran. With a determined effort, she\u2019d remained on the sidelines of his life, writing occasional letters and sending gifts at the appropriate times.</p><p>Now she would have the opportunity to give Vaughn the things she\u2019d set aside for him so many years ago. It\u2019d been her prayer that they meet before she died.</p><p>She had to stop herself from being greedy. She would gladly accept whatever time Vaughn Kyle was willing to grant her.</p><p>Carrie found herself smiling as she walked into the family home shortly after six. She paused in the entry way to remove the handknit scarf from around her neck and shrug out of her coat. Softly humming a Christmas tune, she savored the warm feelings left by her visit with Vaughn. She\u2019d enjoyed getting to know him. Even though it\u2019d been years since she\u2019d spent this much time in a man\u2019s company, the initial awkwardness between them had dissipated quickly.</p><p>Vaughn seemed genuinely interested in learning what he could about Hassie and Buffalo Valley. What she appreciated most was that he hadn\u2019t asked any prying questions about her divorce. A lot of people assumed she wanted to tell her side of it, but Carrie found no joy in reliving the most painful, humiliating experience of her life.</p><p>Their dinner conversation had flowed smoothly. He was easy to talk to, and Carrie loved telling him about Buffalo Valley. She was proud to recount its history, especially the developments of the past five years. The improvements could be attributed to several factors, but almost all of them went right back to Hassie Knight and her determination and optimism. Hassie refused to let the town fade into nothingness, refused to let it die like countless other communities throughout the Dakotas.</p> <p>When Carrie walked into the living room, her mother glanced up from her needlework and her two younger brothers hurried in from the kitchen. All three fixed their eyes on her. Everyone seemed to be waiting for her to speak.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Carrie demanded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re curious about your dinner date,\u201d her mother said mildly.</p><p>Carrie should\u2019ve realized her family would hear she\u2019d gone out with Vaughn. How they knew she could only speculate, but in a small town word traveled even faster than it did on the Internet.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d Ken asked, looking as though he\u2019d welcome the opportunity to defend her honor should the occasion arise.</p><p>Part of the pain of her divorce came from knowing that she was the first in their family\u2019s history to whom it had happened. Long-standing marriages were a tradition she would gladly have continued. But she couldn\u2019t stay married to a man who didn\u2019t honor his vows, a man whose unfaithfulness undermined her self-respect, as well as their marriage. Her four brothers had hinted that things with Alec would have worked out differently if they\u2019d been around to see to it. Needless to say, the last thing she wanted was her brothers, much as she loved them, playing the role of enforcers.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s very nice,\u201d she said, carefully weighing her words. She didn\u2019t want to give the impression that there was more to their meeting than a simple, friendly dinner.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t try anything, did he?\u201d Chuck asked.</p><p>Carrie nearly laughed out loud. \u201cOf course he didn\u2019t. Where\u2019s Dad?\u201d she asked, wondering why her father hadn\u2019t leaped into the conversation.</p><p>Before anyone could respond, her father shuffled into the room, wearing his old slippers, a newspaper tucked under his arm and his reading glasses perched on the end of his nose. He stopped abruptly when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cSo how was your hot date?\u201d he asked. He stood in front of his easy chair and waited for her to answer.</p><p>\u201cIt was just dinner,\u201d she protested. \u201cThe only reason he asked me out was to kill time while he waited for Hassie.\u201d It was unlikely they\u2019d be doing this again, which she supposed was just as well. She had to admit she wanted to, but from what he\u2019d said, he was only in the area for the Christmas holidays and then he was going home to Seattle. There was no point in starting something you couldn\u2019t finish, she thought. Not that she knew if he was even interested in her...or available.</p><p>\u201cWill you be seeing him again?\u201d her mother asked, but Carrie wasn\u2019t fooled by her nonchalant tone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s coming back Sunday afternoon to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Her mother smiled, clearly pleased.</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t returning to see me.\u201d It was important her family understand that she had nothing to do with his decision. The sole reason for his visit was to spend time with Hassie.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a shame.\u201d Her father claimed his chair, turning automatically to the sports page. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid you invite him to the tree-lighting ceremony?\u201d Ken asked.</p><p>Her father lowered the newspaper and her mother paused in the middle of a stitch to await her response.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Carrie admitted reluctantly. She\u2019d thought of mentioning it, but couldn\u2019t see the purpose. She glanced around the room, looking at each hopeful face.</p><p>What she didn\u2019t say was that she would\u2019ve welcomed the opportunity to know Vaughn Kyle better. The few hours she\u2019d spent with him had helped her realize that her heart was still capable of response, that it hadn\u2019t shriveled up inside her like an orange left too long in the fruit bowl.</p> <p>For that she was grateful.</p><p>As Vaughn pulled the rental car into the long driveway that led to his parents\u2019 home, he saw that his mother had turned on the back porch light. It wasn\u2019t really necessary, since the outside of the entire house was decorated with Christmas lights.</p><p>He knew his mother had made tentative plans for a dinner with friends on Sunday afternoon and might not be pleased by his absence. However, Vaughn didn\u2019t mind returning to Buffalo Valley. He\u2019d enjoyed meeting Carrie and learning some of the town\u2019s recent history. He\u2019d report this information to Natalie; she might find it useful. Carrie Hendrickson was an interesting contrast to the women he\u2019d met and dated in Seattle during the past few years\u2014including Natalie, his sort-of fianc\u00e9e. Carrie had shied away from talking about herself, which was a refreshing change from what he\u2019d grown accustomed to hearing. A recent dinner date with Natalie had been spent discussing every aspect of her career and the Value-X corporation\u2014as if their work was all they had to talk about. He\u2019d come away with a letdown feeling, feeling, somehow, that he\u2019d missed out on something important...only he didn\u2019t know quite what. After all, he admired Natalie\u2019s drive and ambition and her unemotional approach to life.</p><p>His mother was finishing the dinner dishes when he entered the kitchen. \u201cHow was your visit?\u201d she asked, rinsing a pan before setting it on the drainboard.</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s Hassie?\u201d she asked, looking expectantly at him as she reached for the towel to dry her hands. \u201cYou did give her my love, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was exhausted.\u201d He explained that the pharmacist had been at a meeting when he arrived and that her assistant had convinced him to wait until she got back. Neither she nor Carrie had mentioned the reason for the meeting, but whatever it was had drained her, emotionally and physically.</p><p>His mother\u2019s brow furrowed with concern. \u201cShe\u2019s not ill, is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, but I didn\u2019t want to tire her out any more than she already was, so I told her I\u2019d be back on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>His mother\u2019s face clouded and he knew what was coming. The subject of Vaughn Knight always distressed her. Every time his name was brought up, she grew quiet. He suspected she\u2019d postponed a promised visit to Hassie because, for whatever reason, she found it hard to talk about Vaughn. More than once he\u2019d seen tears fill her eyes. His mother wasn\u2019t the only one; his father also tended to avoid conversations about Hassie\u2019s son. All Vaughn knew was that both his parents thought a great deal of the friend who\u2019d lost his life in a rice paddy thirty-three years earlier. So much that it still caused them pain.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing this,\u201d she said. \u201cOver the years I\u2019ve wanted to talk about Vaughn, but I get choked up whenever time I try.\u201d</p> <p>She grabbed a bottle of hand lotion and occupied herself with that for a few moments, but Vaughn wasn\u2019t fooled. She didn\u2019t want him to see that her eyes were brimming with tears.</p><p>\u201cHassie will do a far better job of telling you about Vaughn than your father or I could.\u201d</p><p>Impulsively Vaughn hugged his mother, then joined his father, who was watching television in the living room.</p><p>On Sunday the drive into Buffalo Valley seemed to go faster than it had on Friday. He knew exactly where he needed to go, and the very landscape he\u2019d found monotonous two days earlier now seemed familiar, even welcoming.</p><p>When he pulled into town, Buffalo Bob was spreading salt on the sidewalk in front of his own place and the businesses on either side. He waved, and Vaughn returned the gesture, then eased into a parking spot near the pharmacy. Once again he was struck by what an appealing town Buffalo Valley was. It felt as though he\u2019d stepped back in time, to an era when family and a sense of community were priorities, when neighbor helped neighbor and people felt responsible for one another.</p><p>A sign on the door stated that the drugstore was open from noon until five on Sundays during December. When he walked inside, Vaughn found Hassie behind the counter. He automatically looked for Carrie and wasn\u2019t disappointed when he saw her over by the cash register, checking receipts. She paused in her task as soon as she saw him.</p><p>To his surprise, his mind had drifted toward her a number of times since Friday. He was attracted by her charm, which was real and uncontrived. She was genuine and warm, and he liked the pride in her eyes when she talked about her town.</p><p>She froze, as if she, too, had been thinking of him. That was a pleasant thought and one that sent a shiver of guilt through him. He was as good as engaged to Natalie, and the last thing he should be doing was flirting with another woman.</p> <p>\u201cRight on time,\u201d Hassie said, sounding much livelier this afternoon than she had two days earlier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m rarely tardy when I have a date with a beautiful woman,\u201d he teased, and watched both Hassie and Carrie smile. He generally didn\u2019t have much use for flattery, but occasionally it served a purpose. In this case, his rather silly statement had given everyone, including him, a moment of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cYou going to be all right here by yourself?\u201d She turned to Carrie.</p><p>\u201cOf course. You two go and visit, and don\u2019t you worry about a thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just get my coat,\u201d Hassie said, and disappeared to retrieve it. While she was gone, he had a few minutes with Carrie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing this for Hassie,\u201d she said. \u201cIt means so much to her to be sharing her son\u2019s life with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing it out of any sense of charity.\u201d Vaughn was truly interested in learning what he could about his namesake.</p><p>Hassie returned, wearing a long, dark coat, and they walked over to her house, which was one street off Main. Vaughn slowed his gait to match hers, tucking her arm in the crook of his elbow. Together they strolled leisurely down the newly shoveled sidewalk.</p><p>The house resembled something out of a 1950s movie. The furniture was large and bulky, covered in thick navy-blue fabric. Doilies decorated the back of the chair, and three were strategically placed across the back of the matching sofa. Even the television set was an old-fashioned floor model.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll only take me a minute to make tea,\u201d Hassie announced heading toward the kitchen. He was given instructions to sit down and to look through the photo albums she\u2019d already laid out.</p><p>Vaughn opened the biggest album. The first photograph he saw was a black-and-white version of a much younger Hassie standing with a baby cradled in her arms. A tall, handsome man stood awkwardly beside her, grinning self-consciously. His hand was on the shoulder of a little girl about four or five who stood in front of them, her dark brown hair in long braids.</p><p>Thereafter, photograph after photograph documented the life of Vaughn Knight. He was in Boy Scouts and active in his church. His school pictures showed increasing growth and maturity. When he reached high school, Vaughn had grown tall and athletic; a series of newspaper articles detailed his success on the basketball court and the football field. The year he was a senior, Buffalo Valley High School won the state football championship, with Vaughn Knight as the star quarterback. Another article named him Most Valuable Player.</p><p>His high-school graduation picture revealed the face of a young man eager to explore the world.</p><p>Hassie rejoined him, carrying a tray with a ceramic pot and two matching cups, as well as a plate of small cookies.</p><p>Vaughn stood and took the tray from her, placing it on the coffee table, and waited while she poured. He noticed that her hands were unsteady, but he didn\u2019t interrupt or try to assist her.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished, she picked up a round, plain hatbox and removed the lid. \u201cThe top letter is the first one that mentions your mother.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn reached for the envelope.</p><p>September 30, 1966</p><p>Dear Mom and Dad,</p><p>I\u2019m in love. Don\u2019t laugh when you read this. Rick and I went to a hootenanny last night and there was this terrific girl there. Her name\u2019s Barbara Lowell, and guess what? She\u2019s from Grand Forks. She\u2019s got long blond hair and the most incredible smile you\u2019ve ever seen. After the hootenanny we drank coffee and talked for hours. I\u2019ve never felt like this about any other girl. She\u2019s smart and funny and so beautiful I had a hard time not staring at her. Even after I left her, I was so wrapped up in meeting her I couldn\u2019t sleep. First thing this morning, I called her and we talked for two hours. Rick is thoroughly disgusted with me and I don\u2019t blame him, but I\u2019ve never been in love before.</p><p>As soon as I can, I want to bring her home for you to meet. You\u2019ll understand why I feel the way I do once you see her for yourselves.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Vaughn</p><p>\u201cThe Rick he\u2019s writing about is my dad?\u201d Vaughn asked.</p><p>Hassie nodded. \u201cHere\u2019s another one you might find interesting.\u201d She lifted a batch of letters from the box.</p><p>It was apparent from the way she sorted through the dates that she\u2019d reread each letter countless times.</p><p>July 16, 1967</p><p>Dear Mom and Dad,</p><p>I\u2019ve made my decision, but I have to tell you it was probably the most difficult I\u2019ve ever had to make. I love Barb, and both of us want to get married right away. If I were thinking just of me, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019d do before I ship out. But I\u2019m following your example, Dad. You and Mom waited until after the war to marry, and you came back safe and whole. I will, too.</p><p>Barb cried when I told her I felt it was best to delay the wedding until after my tour. Although you never advised me one way or the other, I had the feeling you thought it was better this way.</p><p>Vaughn stopped reading. \u201cDid you want him to wait before marrying my mother?\u201d</p><p>Hassie closed her eyes. \u201cHis father and I thought they were both too young. In the years that followed, I lived to regret that. Perhaps if Vaughn had married your mother, there might have been a grandchild. I realize that\u2019s terribly selfish, and I hope you\u2019ll forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to forgive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always wondered if Jerry would\u2019ve lived longer if we\u2019d had grandchildren. Valerie was still in college at the time and wasn\u2019t married yet. A few years after that, she moved to Hawaii to take a job and met her husband there, but by then it was too late for Jerry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your husband took the news of Vaughn\u2019s death very hard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce we received word about Vaughn, my husband was never the same. He was close to both children, but the shock of Vaughn\u2019s death somehow made him lose his emotional balance. Much as he loved Valerie and me, he couldn\u2019t get over the loss of his son. He went into a deep depression and started having heart problems. A year later, he died, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHeart attack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, yes, but Vaughn\u2019s death is what really killed him, despite what that death certificate said. He simply gave up caring about anything. I wish...\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Vaughn said, and meant it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d She patted his hand. \u201cGod knew better. Had your mother and my son married, you would never have been born.\u201d</p> <p>It must have hit her hard that her son\u2019s fianc\u00e9e and closest friend married each other within a year of his death. \u201cWere you upset when my parents got married?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA little in the beginning, but then I realized that was exactly what Vaughn would have wanted. He did love her, and I know in my heart of hearts that she loved him, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did.\u201d Vaughn could say that without hesitation.</p><p>Hassie plucked a tissue from the nearby box and dabbed at her eyes. \u201cI\u2019d like you to have this.\u201d She reached for a second box and withdrew a heavy felt crest displaying the letters BVHS. It took Vaughn a moment to recognize that it was from a letterman\u2019s jacket.</p><p>\u201cVaughn was very proud of this. He earned it in wrestling. He was a natural at most sports. Basketball and football were barely a challenge, but that wasn\u2019t the case with wrestling. Many an afternoon he\u2019d walk into the pharmacy and announce to his father and me that he was quitting. By dinnertime he\u2019d change his mind and then he\u2019d go back the next day.\u201d She paused, dabbing at her eyes again. \u201cOur children were the very best of Jerry and me. Vaughn was a good son, and losing him changed all of us forever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d be honored to have this letter,\u201d Vaughn said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Hassie whispered. She smiled faintly through her tears. \u201cYou must think me an old fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he was quick to tell her. \u201cI\u2019m very glad you showed me all this.\u201d For the first time Vaughn Knight was more than a name, someone remembered who\u2019d been lost in a war fought half a world away. He was alive in the words of his letters, in the photographs and in the heart of his mother.</p><p>\u201cHis letters from Vietnam are in this box,\u201d Hassie said. \u201cThey\u2019ll give you a feel for what it was like. If you\u2019re interested...\u201d</p><p>Having served in the military, Vaughn was, of course, interested. He sat back and read the first letter. When he\u2019d finally finished them all, it\u2019d grown dark and Hassie was busy in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s after six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He found that hard to believe. \u201cI had no idea I\u2019d kept you this long. I apologize, Hassie. You should have stopped me.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t. Your interest was a pleasure to me. Everything was fine with the store\u2014Carrie\u2019s fully capable of handling anything that might come up. Besides, we\u2019re closed now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could\u2019ve been a writer, your son,\u201d Vaughn said, setting aside the last letter. For a few hours he\u2019d been completely drawn into Vaughn Knight\u2019s descriptions of people and landscapes and events. Although the details were lightly sketched, a vivid picture of the young soldier\u2019s life had revealed itself through his words.</p><p>\u201cI often thought that myself,\u201d Hassie agreed. After a brief silence she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to interrupt you to ask about dinner. I hope it wasn\u2019t overly presumptuous to assume you\u2019d join me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that very much.\u201d</p><p>Hassie nodded once, slowly, as if she considered his company of great worth.</p><p>While she put the finishing touches on the meal, Vaughn phoned his parents to tell them he\u2019d be later than anticipated. \u201cBe sure and give Hassie my love,\u201d his mother instructed. \u201cTell her your father and I plan to visit her soon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will,\u201d he promised.</p><p>When he ended the phone conversation, he found Hassie setting the table. He insisted on taking over, eager to contribute something to their dinner. His admiration and love for the older woman had grown this afternoon in ways he hadn\u2019t thought possible on such short acquaintance. She\u2019d opened his eyes to a couple of important things. First and foremost, he\u2019d learned about the man he\u2019d been named after and discovered he had quite a lot to live up to. Second, he\u2019d come to see his parents in a new light. He understood how their fallen friend had shaped their lives and their marriage. It was no wonder they didn\u2019t often speak of Vaughn Knight. The years might have dulled the pain, but the sense of loss was as strong in them as it was in Hassie.</p><p>They chatted over dinner, and his mood lightened. Hassie was wise and considerate; she seemed to understand how serious his thoughts had become.</p><p>\u201cThe community is lighting the Christmas tree this evening,\u201d she said casually as Vaughn carried their dishes to the sink.</p><p>\u201cAre you going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world,\u201d Hassie informed him. \u201cThe Christmas tree is set up beside the War Memorial. Nearly everyone in town will be there\u2014\u201d she paused and looked at him \u201c\u2014including Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you playing matchmaker with me, Hassie Knight?\u201d he asked. He had a feeling she didn\u2019t miss much\u2014and that she\u2019d seen the way his gaze had been drawn to Carrie when he\u2019d entered the pharmacy.</p><p>Hassie chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s smitten, you know.\u201d</p><p>Smitten. What a wonderful old-fashioned word, Vaughn mused. It would take a better man than him not to feel flattered.</p><p>\u201cYou could do worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know I don\u2019t already have a girlfriend waiting for me in Seattle?\u201d he asked, and wondered what Hassie would think of Natalie. For some reason he had the impression she wouldn\u2019t think much of her sharp-edged sophistication. It\u2019d taken him a while to see past Natalie\u2019s polished exterior; once he had, he\u2019d realized she was just like everyone else, trying to be noticed and to make a name for herself.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Hassie returned confidently.</p><p>He was about to tell her about Natalie, when Hassie said, \u201cCome with me. Come and watch the community tree being lit. There\u2019s no better way to learn about Buffalo Valley.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn\u2019s purpose, other than meeting Hassie, was to do exactly that. Still, seeing Carrie again appealed to him, too\u2014more than it should.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just what I need to put me in the Christmas spirit,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cI\u2019d consider it an honor to accompany you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d Hassie clasped her hands together as though to keep herself from clapping with delight. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how happy this makes me.\u201d</p><p>He helped her on with her coat, then grabbed his own. Taking her arm again, Vaughn guided her out the door and down the front steps. By the time they rounded the corner to Main Street and the City Park, the town was coming to life. There were groups of people converging on the park and cars stopping here and there. The air was filled with festivity\u2014carols played over a loudspeaker, kids shrieking excitedly, shouts of welcome...and laughter everywhere. Vaughn could practically feel the happiness all around him.</p><p>\u201cThis is about as close as it gets to a traffic jam in Buffalo Valley,\u201d Hassie told him.</p><p>As soon as they appeared, it seemed everyone in town called a greeting to Hassie. Vaughn had never seen anything to compare with the reverence and love people obviously felt for her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been holding out on me, Hassie Knight,\u201d an older man teased as he approached. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize I had competition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut it out, Joshua McKenna.\u201d Hassie grinned. \u201cMeet Vaughn Kyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMighty pleased to meet you.\u201d The man thrust out his hand for Vaughn to shake.</p><p>\u201cNearly everyone in a fifty-mile radius is coming,\u201d Joshua said, glancing around him. More and more cars arrived, and the park was actually getting crowded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see Calla. She\u2019s not going to make it home this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd miss spoiling her baby brother?\u201d Joshua returned. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d</p><p>Hassie laughed delightedly. \u201cI should have known better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeb, Maddy and the kids are already here.\u201d</p><p>The names flew over Vaughn\u2019s head, but it was apparent that Hassie loved each family.</p><p>\u201cMaddy owns the grocery,\u201d Joshua explained as they strolled across the street and entered the park. \u201cShe\u2019s married to my son. Best thing that ever happened to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes\u2014I saw the grocery,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cMaddy. I remember. The fantastic reindeer.\u201d</p><p>Joshua grinned widely. \u201cYup, that\u2019s our Maddy. Loves any excuse to decorate\u2014and does a great job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have two of the most precious children you\u2019ll ever want to see,\u201d Hassie added, \u201cwith another on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first pregnancy and this latest one were real surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet Jeb\u2019s developed a liking for blizzards,\u201d Hassie murmured, and the two older folks burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to know the history of that family to understand what\u2019s so amusing,\u201d Carrie said, joining them.</p><p>\u201cHello again,\u201d Vaughn murmured.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn had trouble looking away.</p><p>\u201cHow about you and Carrie getting me some hot chocolate?\u201d the older woman asked.</p><p>\u201cBring some for me, too, while you\u2019re at it,\u201d Joshua said.</p><p>\u201cI think we just got our marching orders,\u201d Carrie told him, her eyes smiling. \u201cIs that okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind if you don\u2019t,\u201d Vaughn replied.</p><p>The cold had brought color to her cheeks, and her long blond hair straggled out from under her wool hat. \u201cIt\u2019s fine with me. Buffalo Bob and Merrily are serving cocoa and cookies over there,\u201d she said a little breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d Vaughn said over his shoulder as he followed Carrie.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t rush,\u201d Hassie called after him...and then he thought he saw her wink at him.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>The Christmas lights strung around the outside of the old house welcomed Vaughn back to his parents\u2019 home. His mother had been born and raised in Grand Forks, but his grandparents had moved to Arizona when he was six. Vaughn had no recollection of visiting the Dakotas, although he was certain they had. His memories centered on the Denver area and his father\u2019s family. Not until Rick was accepted for early retirement did they decide to return to the home that had been in the Lowell family for more than a hundred years.</p><p>The television blared from the living room as Vaughn let himself into the house, entering through the door off the kitchen after stomping the snow from his shoes on the back porch. He unzipped his jacket and hung it on a peg, along with his muffler.</p><p>\u201cIs that you, Vaughn?\u201d his mother called.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s Santa,\u201d he joked.</p><p>He watched as his mother, still holding her needlepoint, hurried into the kitchen. \u201cYou\u2019re not hungry, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI filled up on cookies and hot chocolate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His mother studied him as if to gauge how the meeting with Hassie had gone\u2014the real question she wanted to ask, he suspected. \u201cDid you have a...good visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He nodded reassuringly. \u201cWe talked before dinner, but afterward there was a tree-lighting ceremony in the park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou attended that?\u201d His mother sounded pleased.</p><p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d His response was flippant, as though this was the very thing he\u2019d normally do. In truth, though, Vaughn couldn\u2019t recall attending anything like it since he was in grade school. The evening had been quite an experience. The whole town had come alive with music and laughter and people enjoying one another\u2019s company. Christmas had never been a big deal to Vaughn\u2014but he\u2019d never seen an entire community join together like this, either. He knew it had made a lasting impression on him, that it left him longing for the same kind of warmth. For a true spirit of celebration, far removed from sophisticated parties and decorator-trimmed trees.</p> <p>\u201cHow is Hassie?\u201d his mother asked.</p><p>Vaughn wasn\u2019t sure what to say. Hassie was without a doubt one of the most dynamic women he\u2019d ever met. She possessed character and depth and a heart that poured out love for her family and her community. He\u2019d immediately seen how deeply she was loved and respected. After these hours in her company, Vaughn had understood why. \u201cShe\u2019s an extraordinary woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His mother\u2019s voice was soft, a little tentative. Before Vaughn could say more, she\u2019d retreated into the living room.</p><p>Vaughn followed and his father muted the television, obviously waiting for him to enlighten them about his visit.</p><p>\u201cHassie let me read the letters her son wrote from Vietnam.\u201d</p> <p>His mother resumed her needlepoint and lowered her head, as though the stitches demanded her full attention.</p><p>\u201cThey were riveting. I learned about the war itself, things I could never have learned from a book, and ab out the man who wrote them.\u201d At the time, Hassie\u2019s son had been younger than Vaughn was now. In his letters, Vaughn had recognized the other man\u2019s sense of humanity, his hatred of war and his desire to make a difference, to share in a struggle for freedom.</p><p>\u201cWe met at the University of Michigan during our freshman year of college,\u201d his father said, and his eyes went blank. He seemed to be back in a different place, a different time. Vaughn knew he hadn\u2019t been accepted into the service himself because of poor eyesight. \u201cHe was my roommate. Both of us were away from home for the first time and in an environment completely foreign and unfamiliar. I suppose it\u2019s only natural that we became close.\u201d</p><p>His mother added in a low voice, \u201cHe was the most generous person I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got a part-time job tutoring a youngster who had leukemia,\u201d his father continued, his gaze focused on the television screen. \u201cHe was hired for three hours a week, but Vaughn spent much more time with him than that. He played games with Joey, talked to him, cheered him up, and when Joey died at thirteen, the boy\u2019s mother said Vaughn had been his best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of person he was,\u201d his mother said.</p> <p>\u201cHassie gave me the school letter he earned in wrestling. And then, after I walked her back home, she said there was something else she wanted me to have.\u201d His parents looked up when he paused. Even now, Vaughn could hardly believe Hassie would give him such a gift.</p><p>\u201cWhat, son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer husband\u2019s gold pocket watch. It would\u2019ve been Vaughn\u2019s had he lived.\u201d Hassie had placed it in his hands with tears filming her eyes, then closed his fingers around it.</p><p>\u201cTreasure it, Vaughn,\u201d his mother whispered.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Vaughn\u2019s first reaction had been to refuse something that was clearly a valuable family heirloom, something that meant a great deal to the old woman. He\u2019d felt the significance of her gift and was moved by the solemnity of her words and gestures when she\u2019d presented it to him.</p><p>He would always keep it safe. And he would pass it down to his oldest son or daughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did Hassie tell you?\u201d his father asked.</p><p>\u201cShe...said how much Vaughn had loved Mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn studied his father, looking for any sign of jealousy. If he\u2019d been in his father\u2019s shoes\u2014well, he wasn\u2019t entirely sure how he\u2019d feel.</p><p>\u201cWe planned to marry,\u201d his mother said, \u201cbut Hassie probably told you that.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShe showed me the letter in which Vaughn explains why it would be best to wait until he returned from Vietnam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly, he didn\u2019t return. And everything worked out in a completely different way.\u201d His mother took his father\u2019s hand and held it and they gazed at each other for a moment. \u201cBut a good way,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI often wondered what Hassie really thought about the two of us getting married,\u201d his father said. He stared at Vaughn as if, after meeting Hassie, he could supply the answer.</p><p>Indeed, Vaughn had seen the look that came over her face when she mentioned his parents\u2019 marriage. \u201cAt first I think she took it hard.\u201d This didn\u2019t appear to surprise either of his parents.</p><p>\u201cOur marriage was a reminder that Vaughn was never coming home,\u201d his mother said, \u201cand that no matter how much pain the world brings us, life continues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said as much herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think...she was disappointed in us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps in the beginning,\u201d Vaughn agreed, \u201cbut she changed her mind later. She told me she felt that her son approved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he did,\u201d his mother whispered.</p><p>His father reached abruptly for the remote, indicating that the conversation was over. Sound flared back, and Vaughn got up and went to the kitchen to pour himself a cup of coffee before rejoining his parents.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear, I almost forgot to tell you,\u201d his mother said. \u201cNatalie phoned.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn\u2019s first reaction was that he didn\u2019t want to talk to her. Not tonight. Not after such an emotionally overwhelming day. Knowing Natalie, she\u2019d want to discuss business, and that was the last thing on his mind. He needed to think before he returned the call, needed to absorb what he\u2019d learned first\u2014about the town, about Hassie...about himself.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t too late to call her back,\u201d his mother said. \u201cWith the time difference, it\u2019s barely eight on the West Coast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said absently, his thoughts now on Carrie Hendrickson. Much of the evening had been spent with her. After they\u2019d brought hot chocolate to Hassie and Joshua McKenna, she\u2019d introduced him to her family.</p><p>Vaughn had seen the wary look in her brothers\u2019 eyes and realized how protective they were of her. He wished he\u2019d had more of a chance to talk to Carrie, but they were constantly interrupted. She was a favorite with her nieces and nephews, who were forever running up to her, involving her in their games and their squabbles. She was a natural peacemaker, he observed, one of those people whose very presence brought out the best impulses in others. Like Hassie. And the people in town valued Carrie in much the same way; that was easy to tell. They came to her for advice and comfort. They were drawn to her just as he was.</p><p>\u201cYour father and I are looking forward to meeting Natalie,\u201d his mother said, breaking into his musings.</p><p>Vaughn started guiltily. He was as good as engaged\u2014although, he supposed, all they\u2019d really done was discuss the possibility of marriage. He hadn\u2019t divulged his plans to either of his parents. At Natalie\u2019s request, he hadn\u2019t even told them about his job. \u201cShe\u2019s anxious to meet you, too,\u201d he said, but without a lot of enthusiasm. The contrast between Natalie and Carrie flashed like a neon sign in his brain. One was warm and personable and focused on the needs of her community, the other sharp, savvy and ambitious. When he\u2019d arrived in North Dakota, he thought he knew what he wanted; all at once, he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been seeing her for two years now,\u201d his mother went on, watching him.</p><p>\u201cBarbara, the boy doesn\u2019t need you to tell him that.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn sipped his coffee.This was one conversation he had no wish to continue. \u201cCarrie and I are going Christmas shopping tomorrow,\u201d he said, instead.</p><p>His mother lowered the needlepoint to her lap and stared at him. \u201cCarrie? Who\u2019s Carrie?\u201d</p><p>Vaughn didn\u2019t realize his mistake until it was too late. \u201cA friend.\u201d</p><p>His mother raised her eyebrows as if his answer didn\u2019t please her. \u201cWhen did you have time to make friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe works with Hassie at the pharmacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d It appeared his mother did see, because she said nothing more.</p><p>Vaughn wished he understood his own feelings. A week ago he would have rushed to return Natalie\u2019s call. He wasn\u2019t avoiding her, he decided, but the subject of Value-X and Buffalo Valley. In a matter of days\u2014one day, really\u2014he\u2019d become oddly protective of the town...and its people. Hassie, of course, but Carrie, too. Natalie was bound to ask him questions he no longer wanted to answer.</p><p>One thing was clear; he needed to think the situation through very carefully.</p><p>Craving solitude, Vaughn swallowed the last of his coffee, then announced he was heading for bed.</p><p>His mother glanced up at the wall clock. \u201cAren\u2019t you calling Natalie?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cLater. Don\u2019t worry about it, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVaughn has to rest up for shopping,\u201d his father teased.</p><p>\u201cAh yes, the great shopping expedition. Where will it be, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mall here in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually going to a mall at this time of year?\u201d His father looked at him as though he\u2019d lost his sanity.</p><p>Vaughn gave a nonchalant shrug. He didn\u2019t know what had possessed him to suggest he and Carrie meet at Columbia Mall. His excuse had been that Carrie was a wonderful source of information about the town. He\u2019d never had the opportunity to bring up the subject of Value-X, and wanted to get her reactions to it. Or so he told himself.</p><p>The truth was, he wanted to know her better.</p><p>Hassie sat up in bed, her eyes on the photograph of her son on the bedroom wall. She looked at Jerry\u2019s picture next and Valerie\u2019s, then turned back to Vaughn\u2019s. It was only natural that she\u2019d be thinking about her son tonight.</p><p>Time passed with such inexorable swiftness, she reflected. She had startlingly clear memories of Vaughn as a toddler, stumbling toward her, arms outstretched. If she closed her eyes, she could almost hear his laughter. She\u2019d loved to scoop him into her arms and hug him close until he squirmed, wanting to run and play with his older sister. As they grew older, Valerie had listened to his confidences and offered a big sister\u2019s sage advice.</p><p>How carefree life had been for her and Jerry in the early 1950s. Simple pleasures had meant a great deal back then. She could think of no greater comfort than sitting with her husband after a day at the pharmacy, a day they\u2019d spent working together. Jerry would slip his arm around her shoulder and she\u2019d press her head against his. He loved to whisper the sweetest words in her ear, and oh, she\u2019d enjoyed being in his arms. In those days, it seemed the sun would never stop shining and the world would always be filled with happiness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Turning out the light, Hassie nestled under the covers and let her memories take her back. Valerie and Vaughn used to come to the pharmacy every afternoon after school. To this day she could still picture the two of them sitting at the soda fountain, waiting to be served an after-school snack. They were a normal sister and brother, constantly bickering. Valerie always teased Vaughn, and when she did, he\u2019d tug her pigtails hard enough to bring tears to her eyes. Then it would be up to Hassie to chastise them both. Softhearted Jerry had left the discipline to her. Hassie hated it, but knew her children needed to understand that their actions had consequences.</p><p>The years flew by so fast! Looking back, Hassie wished she\u2019d appreciated each day a little more, treasured each moment with her children while they were young. Before she could account for all the years that had passed, it was 1960, and Vaughn was in high school.</p><p>Jerry was especially proud of Vaughn\u2019s athletic talent. He, too, had been a sports star in his youth. Vaughn had played team sports throughout his four years in high school, and they\u2019d never missed a game. One or the other, and often both of them, were at his games, even if it meant closing the pharmacy, although they didn\u2019t do that often. They always sat in the same section of the stands so Vaughn would know where to find them. When his team came onto the field, it wasn\u2019t unusual for him to turn toward the bleachers and survey the crowd until he located his parents. Then he\u2019d smile and briefly raise one hand.</p><p>Without even trying, Hassie could hear the crowds and recall the cheerleaders\u2019 triumphant leaps, while the school band played in the background.</p> <p>Watching Vaughn play ball had been hard on Hassie\u2019s nerves. Twice that she could remember, her son had been injured. Both times Jerry had to stop her from running onto the field. She stood with the other concerned parents, her hands over her mouth, as the coaches assessed his injuries. On both occasions Vaughn had walked off the playing field unaided, but it\u2019d been pride that had carried him. The first time his arm had been broken, and the second, his nose.</p><p>His high-school years had been wonderful. The girls always had eyes for Vaughn. Not only was he a star athlete and academically accomplished, he was tall and good-looking. The phone nearly rang off the hook during his junior and senior years. There\u2019d never been anyone special, though, until he met Barbara Lowell in college. She\u2019d been his first love and his last.</p><p>Hassie recalled how handsome he\u2019d looked in his brand-new suit for the junior-senior prom, although he\u2019d been uncomfortable in the starched white dress shirt. The photo from the dance revealed how ill at ease he\u2019d been. His expression, Jerry had said, was that of someone who expected to be hit by a water balloon.</p><p>Hassie had suggested he ask Theresa Burkhart to the biggest dance of the year. He\u2019d done so, but he\u2019d never asked her out for a second date. When Hassie asked him why, Vaughn shrugged and had nothing more to say. Every afternoon for a week after the prom, Theresa had stopped at the soda fountain, obviuosly hoping to run into Vaughn. Each afternoon she left, looking disappointed.</p><p>Packing Vaughn\u2019s suitcase the day before he went off to the University of Michigan was another fond memory. She\u2019d lovingly placed his new clothes in the suitcase that would accompany him on this first trip away from home. Although saddened by his departure, she took comfort in knowing he\u2019d only be gone for a few years. This wasn\u2019t a new experience, since Valerie had left four years earlier and was attending Oregon State. She was working part-time and seemed in no particular hurry to finish her education. Jerry and Hassie had been reassured by Vaughn\u2019s promise to return as a pharmacist himself. He shared their commitment to community and their belief in tradition.</p> <p>Soon the kitchen table was littered with his letters home. The letter in which he first mentioned meeting Barbara had brought back memories of Hassie\u2019s own\u2014like meeting Jerry at college just before the war. The day that letter arrived, she\u2019d sat at the kitchen table with her husband and they\u2019d held hands and reminisced about the early days of their own romance.</p><p>Then the unthinkable happened. News of a war in a country she\u2019d barely heard of escalated daily. The papers, television and radio were filled with reports, despite President Johnson\u2019s promises to limit the United States\u2019 involvement. Then the day came when Vaughn phoned home and announced, like so many young men his age, that he\u2019d been drafted. A numbness had spread from Hassie\u2019s hand and traveled up her arm. It didn\u2019t stop until it had reached her heart. Vaughn was going to war. Like his father before him, he would carry a rifle and see death.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen. For a while, men in college were exempt, but with the war\u2019s escalation, they were now included. Vaughn took the news well, but not Hassie. He had to do his part, he told her. It was too easy to pass the burden onto someone else. Citizenship came with a price tag.</p><p>Suddenly bombs were exploding all around her. Terrified, Hassie hid her head in her hands, certain she was about to die. Bullets whizzed past her and she gasped, her heart cramping with a terrible fear. All at once she was cold, colder than she could ever remember being, and then she was flat on her back with the sure knowledge that she\u2019d been hit. The sky was an intense shade of blue, and she was simultaneously lying there and hovering far above. But when she looked down, it wasn\u2019t her face she saw. It was the face of her dying son. His blood drained out of him with unstoppable speed as the frantic medic worked over him.</p><p>Her son, the child of her heart, was dying. He saw her and tried to smile, to tell her it was all right, but his eyes closed and he was gone. Her baby was forever gone.</p><p>A crushing load of grief weighed on Hassie\u2019s heart. She cried out and, groaning, sat upright.</p> <p>It was then she realized she\u2019d fallen asleep. This had all been a dream. Awash with memories, she\u2019d drifted into a dream so real she could hear the fading echoes of exploding ammunition as she dragged herself out of a past world and back to reality.</p><p>As her eyes adjusted to the dark, her gaze darted from one familiar object to another. From the bedroom door where her housecoat hung on a hook to the dresser top with the silver mirror and brush set Jerry had given her on their tenth anniversary.</p><p>\u201cVaughn.\u201d His name was a broken whisper, and she realized that she couldn\u2019t remember what he looked like. His face, so well loved, refused to come. Strain as she might, she couldn\u2019t see him. Panic descended, and she tossed aside the blankets and slid out of bed. It wasn\u2019t her son\u2019s image that filled her mind, but the face of another young man. Another Vaughn.</p><p>Vaughn Kyle.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she whispered, clutching the bedpost. Leaning against it, she heaved a deep, quivering sigh and climbed back into bed.</p><p>Wrapping the quilt around her, she tucked her arm beneath her pillow and closed her eyes. Yes, it made sense that she\u2019d dream of Vaughn that night. Her Vaughn. It also made sense that it was Vaughn Kyle\u2019s face she now saw. After all, she\u2019d spent much of the day with him.</p><p>Barbara and Rick had done a good job raising him. Vaughn was a fine man, honest and genuine, sensitive yet forthright. She was grateful she\u2019d had the opportunity to meet him before she died.</p><p>Giving him the gold watch had been a spur-of-the-moment decision. It was the one possession of Jerry\u2019s she\u2019d held back from Valerie and her two granddaughters. Valerie lived in Hawaii and although they were close, they rarely visited each other. Hassie had flown to the island once, but all those tourists and hordes of people had made her nervous. Not only that, she wasn\u2019t comfortable in planes, and the long flight made her nervous. A few years back, after a scare with Hassie\u2019s heart, Valerie had flown out to spend time with her, but had soon grown bored and restless.</p> <p>Hassie didn\u2019t think Val\u2019s daughters, Alison and Charlotte, would have much interest in their grandfather\u2019s watch. But it was precious to her, so she\u2019d kept it.</p><p>She knew when she pressed the watch into Vaughn\u2019s palm that this was the right thing to do. He looked as if he was about to argue with her, but he didn\u2019t and she was glad. Still, his hesitation told her more clearly than any words that he understood the significance of her gift.</p><p>Warm once more, Hassie stretched out her legs, enjoying the feel of the sheets against her bare skin. She smiled, remembering the exchange she\u2019d witnessed between Carrie and Vaughn Kyle last night. She hoped something came of it. After her divorce Carrie was understandably wary about relationships, but Hassie felt confident that Vaughn would never intentionally do anything to hurt her.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t something be done?\u201d Carrie asked, pacing in front of Heath Quantrill\u2019s polished wood desk. As the president of Buffalo Valley Bank, he just might know of some way to stop Value-X from moving into town. In the past day or so, news of the retailer\u2019s plans had spread through town faster than an August brushfire. Carrie had first heard of it that morning. She suspected Hassie knew and had been protecting her; she also suspected there\u2019d been rumors last night, but she\u2019d been too involved with Vaughn to notice.</p><p>Heath\u2019s frown darkened. It went without saying that he wasn\u2019t any happier about this than she was. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Carrie, but Ambrose Kohn is a difficult man to deal with. The town council has spoken to him several times. Hassie tried and I did, too, but he isn\u2019t willing to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew before this morning?\u201d she fired back. \u201cHassie, too?\u201d That was what she thought\u2014and it explained a great deal. Hassie just hadn\u2019t been herself lately, but every inquiry was met with denial.</p><p>Heath nodded.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t Mr. Kohn realize what he\u2019s doing?\u201d Carrie found it hard to believe he could be so callous toward the town.</p><p>\u201cHe knows all too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople have a right to know that the entire future of our town is at risk.\u201d She could only imagine what would happen to her father\u2019s store if Value-X set up shop.</p><p>Heath obviously agreed with her. \u201cHassie suggested we keep this under wraps until after Christmas, and the rest of the council decided to go along with her. I don\u2019t know how the news leaked.\u201d He scowled and rolled his gold pen between flat palms.</p><p>Delaying the bad news changed nothing. This morning at breakfast her father had announced what he\u2019d learned. He was already alternating between depression and panic. He\u2019d heard it from Joanie Wyatt at the tree-lighting ceremony. The Wyatts had sent away for stock information, and Joanie had read over a prospectus; she\u2019d immediately seen that Buffalo Valley was listed as a possible expansion site. She\u2019d immediately phoned Buffalo Bob, who\u2019d reluctantly confirmed it.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s been signed yet,\u201d Heath said, as though that should make her feel better. It didn\u2019t.</p><p>She glanced at her watch, wishing she had more time to get all this straight in her mind. Although she was eager to meet Vaughn at the Columbia Mall as promised, she wasn\u2019t in the mood for Christmas activities. Not with this Value-X problem hanging over all their heads.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to anyone at the corporate office?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Heath nodded. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey weren\u2019t interested in listening, were they?\u201d Heath\u2019s disheartened look was answer enough. \u201cIt\u2019s progress, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Heath muttered. \u201cListen, I\u2019ve got a meeting in ten minutes. I\u2019m sorry, Carrie. I know what this will mean for your father\u2019s business and Knight\u2019s Pharmacy, too. I\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you buy the property yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI approached Kohn about that, but...\"</p> <p>\u201cHe won\u2019t sell it to you?\u201d Carrie asked in an outraged voice.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say he\u2019d love a bidding war\u2014one I\u2019d be sure to lose.\u201d Heath stood and retrieved his overcoat from a closet.</p><p>Her gaze pleaded with his. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find a way to keep Value-X out of Buffalo Valley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKohn hasn\u2019t heard the last of this,\u201d Heath promised as he escorted her out of the bank.</p><p>Carrie accompanied him to his four-wheel-drive vehicle.</p> <p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d she asked, feeling the need to act.</p><p>Heath shook his head as he opened his car door. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Carrie, this isn\u2019t over yet. Not by a long shot.\u201d</p><p>All Carrie could do was trust that, somehow or other, he\u2019d convince Ambrose Kohn to be reasonable.</p><p>The drive into Grand Forks passed in a fog. Burdened by the news, Carrie was surprised when the two lanes widened to four as she reached the outskirts of the big city.</p><p>Vaughn was waiting for her inside the mall at a coffee shop they\u2019d designated as their meeting place. He stood as she approached. She was struck again by what an attractive man he was. Her ex-husband had been attractive, too, but Alec\u2019s good looks had belied his selfish, arrogant nature. She\u2019d learned, the hard way, that a handsome face proved nothing about the inner man. No, handsome is as handsome does, her grandma always said. Which made Vaughn Kyle very handsome, indeed.</p><p>He\u2019d been so gentle and caring with Hassie. He\u2019d spent time with her, listened to her talk about her son. Carrie marveled at his patience and his good humor and the respect he seemed to genuinely feel for Hassie and for the town. When he\u2019d asked her to meet him in Grand Forks to help him finish his shopping, she\u2019d agreed. It\u2019d been a long, long time since a man had impressed her as much as Vaughn Kyle.</p> <p>\u201cThanks for coming,\u201d he said now.</p><p>Although it was relatively early, the mall was already frantic. With exactly a week left before Christmas, the entire population of Grand Forks had apparently decided to cram itself inside.</p><p>\u201cThe only person I still need to buy for is my mother,\u201d he told her, looking around as though he already regretted this.</p><p>\u201cWhat about perfume?\u201d Carrie wasn\u2019t feeling too inspired, either.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s allergic to a lot of those scents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, how about...\u201d Carrie proceeded to rattle off several other suggestions, all of which he categorically dismissed for one reason or another.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any more ideas?\u201d he asked, looking desperate.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but we might stumble across something while we\u2019re here.\u201d</p> <p>Vaughn sighed. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound promising.\u201d He glanced around. \u201cHow about if we find a quiet restaurant and discuss it over lunch?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to ask twice. She was as anxious to get away from the crowds as he was. They found an Italian place Joanie and Brandon Wyatt had once recommended and were seated almost immediately. Sitting at their table with its red-and-white-checkered tablecloth, Carrie could see why her friends liked it here. The casual atmosphere was perfect. If the food was half as good as the smells wafting from the kitchen, she was in for a treat.</p><p>Carrie quickly made her decision and closed the menu. Lowering her gaze, she pushed thoughts of Value-X from her mind for the umpteenth time. Her worries kept intruding on the pleasant day she was hoping to have.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better tell me,\u201d Vaughn said. His hand reached for hers and he gently squeezed it. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>Apparently she hadn\u2019t done a very good job of hiding her concerns. Rather than blurt everything out, she stared down at the tablecloth for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cWe learned this morning that Value-X is considering Buffalo Valley as a possible site,\u201d she finally said. \u201cApparently they\u2019ve already negotiated for a piece of land. I don\u2019t need to tell you what that\u2019ll do to our community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be a good thing,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cTry to think positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this is progress, we don\u2019t want anything to do with it,\u201d she muttered. Vaughn couldn\u2019t possibly understand. She was sorry she\u2019d brought up the subject. \u201cWe happen to like our town just the way it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight it,\u201d she said confidently.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Vaughn asked. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a little like David fighting Goliath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but like David, you can bet we aren\u2019t going to idly sit by and do nothing.\u201d Already plans had started to form in her mind. \u201cOther communities have succeeded. We can, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re overlooking the positive aspects of a company like Value-X opening a store in Buffalo Valley? They have a lot to offer.\u201d</p><p>Carrie glared at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not. Help me understand.\u201d Vaughn leaned back in his chair, his expression serious.</p><p>\u201cValue-X will ruin everything. We don\u2019t want it, we don\u2019t need it.\u201d Carrie struggled to keep her voice even.</p><p>Vaughn studied her. \u201cI imagine you\u2019re a formidable opponent when you put your mind to something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t only me,\u201d she told him. \u201cThe entire town is up in arms. We haven\u2019t come this far to let some heartless enterprise wipe out all our efforts.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn frowned. \u201cValue-X will mean the end of Knight\u2019s Pharmacy, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>That was only the beginning as far as Carrie could tell. \u201cAnd AceMan Hardware.\u201d She ran one finger across the tines of the fork. \u201cThe only business I can\u2019t see it affecting is the Buffalo Valley Quilting Company.\u201d Carrie shot him a look and wondered why she hadn\u2019t thought of this earlier. \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA quilt. It\u2019s the perfect Christmas gift for your mother.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn didn\u2019t appear convinced. \u201cA quilt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re special. Hand-sewn, and you could go traditional or innovative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the full range of prices,\u201d she said, \u201cbut if the quilt is more than you want to spend, there\u2019re table runners and place mats and lap robes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d The idea seemed to take hold. \u201cThat does sound like a gift she\u2019d enjoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she would,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t think of it earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how do I go about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to drive back to Buffalo Valley so soon, I could choose one for you,\u201d she offered.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps Mom should pick it out herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea\u2014and I know Hassie would love to see her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it would do my mother a world of good to renew her friendship with Hassie.\u201d</p><p>The waitress arrived and took their orders. Seafood linguine for her, lasagna for him. And a glass of red wine for each. \u201cHey, it\u2019s Christmas,\u201d Vaughn said with a grin.</p><p>He took his cell phone from his jacket and flipped it open. Within seconds, he had his mother on the line.</p><p>\u201cWhat about tomorrow?\u201d he asked, looking at Carrie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHassie will be there, won\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s scheduled to work in the morning, but she has the afternoon free. I\u2019ll cover for her, if need be.\u201d</p><p>He relayed the information to his mother, then ended the conversation and slid the phone back inside his jacket. Smiling at her, he said, \u201cThanks, Carrie.\u201d</p><p>A warm feeling came over her, and once again she lowered her gaze. Vaughn Kyle\u2014kind to old women and a thoughtful son. He was exciting and he was interesting and he made her heart beat furiously. She could only regret that he was heading back to Seattle so soon after Christmas.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>\u201cI suppose you heard,\u201d Hassie said when Leta Betts came bustling into the pharmacy late in the afternoon. The word about Value-X had filtered through Buffalo Valley, and the town was rife with speculation. Nearly everyone she knew had stopped by to talk it over with her, as though she had a solution to this perplexing problem.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Leta muttered, walking behind the counter of the soda fountain and pulling out a well-used teapot. \u201cWant me to make you a cup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Hassie had filled prescriptions all afternoon, between interruptions, and she was ready for a break. She\u2019d known that Leta would come by at some point; fortunately, there was a lull just now, which made it a good time to talk to her dearest friend.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Carrie?\u201d Leta found two mugs and set them on the counter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her day off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard she went to see Heath.\u201d</p><p>Hassie had heard about that, as well. Carrie had a good heart and cared about this community with the same intensity as Hassie did. Once Carrie received her Pharm.D., Hassie had planned to turn the business over to her. That was before the threat of Value-X, however. If that threat became a reality, Hassie couldn\u2019t sell the pharmacy, not in good conscience. In all likelihood the place would be out of business within a year after the big retailer moved in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame, you know,\u201d Leta murmured. She dragged a chair closer to the counter and perched on the seat. Leaning forward, she braced her elbows on the edge, sighing deeply. \u201cWho\u2019d have thought something like this would ever happen?\u201d</p><p>Hassie shook her head helplessly. She\u2019d worked so hard to save this town. And now, even if oblivion wasn\u2019t to be its fate, a corporation like Value-X could make Buffalo Valley unrecognizable, could turn it into something that bore no resemblance to the place it had been. The place it should be.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Leta asked.</p><p>Hassie sat next to her and assumed the same slouched pose. Leta was her friend and employee, and there wasn\u2019t anything Hassie couldn\u2019t tell her. But this situation with the conglomerate had her poleaxed. She was at her wit\u2019s end. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll think of something,\u201d Leta insisted, and poured tea into the mugs. She set one in front of Hassie and then added a teaspoon of sugar to her own.</p><p>\u201cNot this time,\u201d Hassie said as she reached for the mug, letting it warm her hands. She was too old and too tired. A few years back she\u2019d fought for her town with determination and ingenuity, but this new war would have to be waged by someone else. She\u2019d done her part. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis was how we both felt when we learned Lindsay had decided to return to Atlanta, remember?\u201d Leta prodded.</p><p>As though Hassie would ever forget. At the last minute Leta\u2019s son, Gage, had realized he\u2019d be making the worst mistake of his life if he let Lindsay leave without telling her how much he loved her. As a result, Lindsay had not only stayed on as a high-school teacher, she\u2019d married Gage. Leta was a grandmother twice over, thanks to the young couple.</p><p>\u201cValue-X is too powerful for me.\u201d A bit of research had revealed that the retailer was accustomed to exactly this kind of local resistance. They had their battle plans worked out to the smallest detail. Hassie remembered from the television expos\u00e9 that the company had a legal team, as well as public-relations people, all of them experts at squelching opposition. Hassie knew the town council couldn\u2019t afford any high-priced attorneys to plead their case. Even if they banded together, they were no match for the company\u2019s corporate attorneys. They were cutthroat, they\u2019d seen it all, done it all. According to the documentary, they\u2019d won in the majority of their cases. Like it or not, Value-X simply overran a community.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t give up,\u201d Leta insisted. She glared at Hassie, as though waiting for some of the old fight to surface.</p> <p>It wouldn\u2019t, though. Not anymore. Slowly Hassie lowered her gaze, refusing to meet her friend\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a lost cause,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t sound like you, Hassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she agreed, glancing at her tired reflection in the mirror above the soda fountain, \u201cbut it won\u2019t matter that much if I lose the pharmacy.\u201d</p><p>Leta\u2019s jaw sagged open. \u201cWh-what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve retired years ago. The only reason I held on as long as I did is the community needs a pharmacy and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about Carrie?\u201d</p><p>Hassie had been so pleased and grateful when Carrie had come to work as an intern. This was what she\u2019d always wanted for the pharmacy. Years ago she\u2019d expected her son to take over, but Vietnam had robbed her of that dream. The hopelessness of the situation settled squarely over her heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Value-X will require a pharmacist. Carrie can apply there.\u201d</p><p>Silent, Leta stared into the distance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Hassie said. \u201cValerie\u2019s been after me to retire, move to Hawaii.... Maybe I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou in Hawaii? Never!\u201d Leta shook her head fiercely. \u201cI\u2019ve always followed your lead\u2014we all have. I don\u2019t know what would\u2019ve become of us if not for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFiddlesticks.\u201d Hassie forced a laugh. \u201cValue-X is coming to town, and that\u2019s all there is to it. We might as well accept the inevitable. Not long from now, both of us will be shopping there and wondering how we ever lived without such a store in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right,\u201d Leta returned, but her words rang false.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just enjoy Christmas,\u201d Hassie suggested, gesturing at the garlands strung from the old-fashioned ceiling lights. \u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKevin won\u2019t be home, but he\u2019ll call from Paris on Christmas Eve. Gage and Lindsay invited me to spend Christmas Day with them.\u201d Hassie knew that Leta would take delight in spoiling four-year-old Joy and two-year-old Madeline.</p><p>\u201cBob and Merrily invited me over in the morning to open gifts with them and Bobby,\u201d Hassie told her friend. They thought of her as Bobby\u2019s unofficial grandmother. Early in their marriage, Bob and Merrily had lost a son\u2014although not to death. They\u2019d fostered a child from an abusive environment and had wanted to adopt him, but in the end, the California authorities had seen fit to place the boy with another family. It\u2019d been a difficult time for the couple. Having lost a son herself, Hassie had understood their grief as only someone who\u2019d walked that path could understand it. She\u2019d tried to bring them comfort and the example of her endurance. Bob and Merrily never forgot her kindness, little as it was. Over the past few years, they\u2019d become as close to her as family.</p><p>\u201cYou finally met Vaughn Kyle,\u201d Leta said. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely a highlight of this Christmas season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Hassie agreed, somewhat cheered. It\u2019d been an unanticipated pleasure, one she\u2019d always remember. In the hours they\u2019d spent with each other, she\u2019d forged a bond with the young man. Meeting Vaughn had left Hassie feeling closer to her own son, although he\u2019d been dead for thirty-three years. Hard to believe so much time had passed since his death....</p><p>\u201cThat was him with Carrie at the tree-lighting ceremony, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Hassie felt a small, sudden joy, sending a ray of light into the gloom she\u2019d experienced earlier. \u201cShe\u2019s spending the afternoon with him in Grand Forks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time she put the divorce behind her.\u201d</p><p>Hassie felt the same way but didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cDo you think something might come of it?\u201d Leta asked, her voice slightly raised.</p><p>Hassie couldn\u2019t answer. Her hours with Vaughn had been taken up with the past, and she hadn\u2019t discovered much at all about his future plans. She knew he\u2019d been honorably discharged from the military and had accepted a position with a Seattle-based company, although he\u2019d never said which one. Probably a big software firm, she decided. From what she understood, he\u2019d be starting work after the first of the year. She felt it was a good sign that he\u2019d come to spend two weeks with his parents.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been to town twice already,\u201d Leta offered. \u201cThat\u2019s encouraging, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>A small smile quivered at the edges of Leta\u2019s mouth. \u201cI remember when Gage first got interested in Lindsay. That boy drummed up a hundred excuses to drive into town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember Jeb and Maddy?\u201d Hassie murmured, her eyes flashing with the memory. These were the thoughts she preferred to cling to. Stories with happy resolutions. Good things happening to good people.</p><p>Leta\u2019s responding grin brightened her face. \u201cI\u2019m not likely to forget. We hadn\u2019t seen hide nor hair of him in months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears,\u201d Hassie corrected. Following the farming accident that cost Jeb McKenna his leg, the farmer-turned-buffalo-rancher became a recluse. Hassie recalled the days Joshua had to practically drag his son into town for Christmas dinner. Then Maddy Washburn bought the grocery and started her delivery service. After those two were trapped together in a blizzard, why, there was no counting the number of times Jeb showed up in Buffalo Valley.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember the day Margaret Eilers stormed into town and yanked Matt out of Buffalo Bob\u2019s?\u201d Leta asked, laughing outright.</p><p>\u201cSure do. She nearly beat him to a pulp.\u201d Tears of laughter filled Hassie\u2019s eyes. \u201cCan\u2019t say I blame her. Those two certainly had their troubles.\u201d</p><p>Margaret had set her sights on Matt Eilers and wanted him in the worst way, faults and all. That was what she got, too. Not three months after they were married, Margaret found out that Matt had gotten a cocktail waitress pregnant. Granted, it had happened before the marriage, but Margaret had still felt angry and betrayed.</p><p>\u201cLook at them now,\u201d Leta said, sobering. \u201cI don\u2019t know any couple more in love.\u201d She drank a sip of her tea. \u201cIf Margaret and Matt can overcome their problems, why can\u2019t Buffalo Valley sort out this thing with Value-X?\u201d</p><p>For the first time all week, Hassie felt hopeful. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right, Leta. Maybe you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Carrie sat down at the kitchen table and reached for the cream, adding it to her coffee. Even though she was twenty-seven years old, she found it comforting to watch her mother stir up a batch of gingerbread cookies. The house was redolent with the scent of cinnamon and other spices.</p><p>Her morning had been busy. After a lengthy conversation with Lindsay Sinclair, who\u2019d been in contact with the Value-X corporate offices, Carrie had spent an hour on the Internet learning out what she could about the big retailer.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a good time yesterday afternoon?\u201d Diane Hendrickson asked. She set the mixing bowl in the refrigerator, then joined Carrie at the table.</p><p>\u201cI had a wonderful time.\u201d She was surprised to realize how much she meant that. Lowering her eyes momentarily, she looked back up. \u201cI told Vaughn about Alec.\u201d</p><p>Her mother held her gaze. Carrie didn\u2019t often speak of her failed marriage, especially not to new acquaintances.</p><p>\u201cIt came up naturally, and for the first time I didn\u2019t feel that terrible sense of...of defeat. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be the same person again, but after talking to Vaughn, I knew I don\u2019t want to be.\u201d</p><p>Her mother smiled softly. \u201cThere was nothing wrong with you, Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, Mom, but I was at fault, too. I suspected Alec was involved with someone else. I simply preferred not to face it. The evidence was right in front of my eyes months before he told me. I don\u2019t ever again want to be the kind of woman who ignores the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom,\u201d she said, loving her mother all the more for her unwavering loyalty. \u201cIt\u2019s time to move forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Vaughn Kyle?\u201d</p><p>Carrie had thought of little else in the past three days. \u201cToo soon to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you like him?\u201d her mother pressed.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d It felt good to admit it. Good to think that her life wouldn\u2019t be forever weighed down by a mistake she\u2019d made when she was too young to understand that her marriage was doomed. Her husband\u2019s betrayal had blindsided her. Outwardly she\u2019d picked up the pieces of her shattered pride and continued her life, but in her heart, Carrie had never completely recovered. Alec had shattered her self-esteem. Somehow she\u2019d convinced herself that there must\u2019ve been something lacking in her; it\u2019d taken her a long time to realize the lack had been his.</p><p>Carrie drank the rest of her coffee and placed the cup in the sink. \u201cWe spoke about Value-X, too, Vaughn and I. At first he didn\u2019t seem to see how a company like that would hurt Buffalo Valley. In fact, he felt it might even have a positive effect. If so, I don\u2019t see one. But he let me vent my frustrations and helped me clarify my thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be seeing him again?\u201d her mother asked innocently enough.</p><p>\u201cMost likely. He\u2019s bringing his mother into town this morning. He\u2019s buying her one of Sarah\u2019s quilts for Christmas and thought she\u2019d like to choose it herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a thoughtful gift.\u201d</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t mention that she\u2019d been the one to suggest it. \u201cThey\u2019re meeting Hassie later.\u201d They hadn\u2019t made any definite plans, but Carrie hoped to meet Vaughn\u2019s mother. She was almost sure he\u2019d stop by, either here or at the store; in fact, she was counting on it.</p><p>The doorbell chimed right then, and fingers crossed, Carrie decided it had to be Vaughn. Her mother went to answer the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCarrie,\u201d she called from the living room, \u201cyou have a visitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind me dropping by unexpectedly,\u201d he was saying to her mother when Carrie walked in. Vaughn stood awkwardly near the door. He removed his gloves and stuffed them in his pockets.</p><p>\u201cHello, Vaughn.\u201d Carrie didn\u2019t bother to disguise her pleasure at seeing him again.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d He looked directly into her eyes. \u201cWould you be free to meet my mother? I left her a few moments ago, drooling over Sarah\u2019s quilts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d Carrie reached into the hall closet for her coat and scarf. \u201cWhat did you think of the quilts?\u201d she asked, buttoning her coat. She wanted him to appreciate Sarah\u2019s talent.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re incredible. You\u2019re right, it\u2019s the perfect gift for Mom.\u201d</p><p>Carrie supposed she had no business feeling proud; the quilt shop wasn\u2019t hers and she had nothing to do with it. But everyone in Buffalo Valley took pride in Sarah\u2019s accomplishments. It was more than the fact that Sarah had started the company in her father\u2019s living room. People viewed her success as a reflection of what had happened to the town itself\u2014the gradual change from obscurity and scant survival to prosperity and acclaim. Her struggles were their own, and by the same token, her successes were a reason to celebrate.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to know how much I enjoyed our time together yesterday,\u201d Vaughn said, matching his steps to hers as they took a shortcut through the park. \u201cI appreciate the suggestion about the quilt. And I learned a lot about you\u2014and Buffalo Valley. You helped me see the town in an entirely different way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was grateful you let me talk out my feelings about Value-X...and everything else.\u201d</p> <p>Vaughn\u2019s arm came around her and he briefly squeezed her shoulder. There was no need to refer to the divorce. He understood what she meant.</p><p>\u201cI talked to Lindsay Sinclair earlier,\u201d Carrie said, changing the subject. \u201cShe phoned the corporate office and asked if the rumors are true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said they were negotiating for property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I told Lindsay, but she doesn\u2019t trust Ambrose Kohn. She said she wouldn\u2019t put it past him to let people think Value-X was interested in the property so Heath or someone else would leap forward and offer to buy it. He\u2019s not exactly the kind of person to generate a lot of trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your friend find out when she talked to the corporate people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst they said they didn\u2019t want to comment on their plans, but when Lindsay pressed the spokeswoman, she admitted that Buffalo Valley\u2019s definitely under consideration.\u201d Carrie\u2019s shoulders tensed. \u201cLindsay took the opportunity to let her know they aren\u2019t welcome in Buffalo Valley.\u201d When she\u2019d heard about that part of the conversation, Carrie had cheered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did the company spokeswoman say then?\u201d</p><p>Carrie laughed. \u201cApparently Value-X\u2019s official response is that according to their studies, a growing community such as Buffalo Valley doesn\u2019t have enough retail choices.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn snorted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. They\u2019re sending a representative after Christmas. This person is supposed to win us over and show us everything Value-X can do for Buffalo Valley.\u201d She couldn\u2019t keep the sarcasm out of her voice.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to listen,\u201d he said mildly.</p><p>Carrie whirled on him. \u201cWe\u2019ll listen, but having a huge chain store in town is not what we want. Joanie Wyatt\u2019s already started a petition, so when the company representative arrives, he or she will be met with the signature of every single person in town.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn said nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhat Value-X doesn\u2019t understand is that Buffalo Valley is a small town with small-town values and that\u2019s exactly the way we want to keep it. If they move in, they\u2019ll ruin everything that makes us who we are.\u201d</p> <p>Vaughn stopped in front of a picnic bench, cleared away the snow with his arm and sat down. \u201cWhat about jobs? Value-X will offer a lot of opportunity to young people. I\u2019ve heard repeatedly that farming communities are seeing their young adults move away because of the lack of financial security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily true, the part about Value-X bringing jobs. After I talked to Lindsay, I got on the Internet and did some research myself. I learned that most of the positions Value-X brings into a town are part-time and low-paying. They offer few benefits to their employees. The worst aspect is that they destroy more jobs than they create.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn\u2019s frown deepened.</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to get carried away about our problems with Value-X.\u201d</p><p>Standing, Vaughn still seemed deep in thought. \u201cNo, I want to hear this. It bothers me that the company isn\u2019t listening to your concerns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t want to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said they\u2019re sending a representative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d she said with a snicker. \u201cTo talk to us, not to listen. They\u2019re under the mistaken impression that we\u2019ll be swayed by a few promises and slick words. They\u2019ve decided we need to think bigger and bolder and stop acting like a small town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Buffalo Valley is a small town.\u201d</p><p>Carrie gave a sharp nod. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>As they approached the Buffalo Valley Quilting Compay, Carrie noticed the middle-aged woman standing inside by the window, looking out into the street. When Vaughn and Carrie appeared, she smiled and waved, then pointed to the quilt on display.</p><p>Carrie waved back, silently applauding his mother\u2019s choice.</p><p>Mrs. Kyle smiled. Her eyes moved to her son and then to Carrie; her expression grew quizzical. Carrie didn\u2019t have time to guess what that meant before Mrs. Kyle opened the glass door, stepped out and introduced herself.</p><p>Barbara Kyle knew that when she agreed to accompany Vaughn into Buffalo Valley, she\u2019d be seeing Hassie Knight. A meeting was inevitable. They hadn\u2019t been together since the day they\u2019d stood in the pouring rain as a military casket was lowered into the ground.</p><p>Following the funeral, she\u2019d kept in touch with Vaughn\u2019s mother. They\u2019d called each other frequently. But despite the war, despite her grief, Barbara\u2019s college courses had continued, and she\u2019d had to immerse herself in a very different kind of reality.</p><p>Rick had lost his best friend, and they began to seek solace from each other. Falling in love with him was a surprise. Barbara hadn\u2019t expected that, hadn\u2019t thought it was possible to love again after losing Vaughn. Rick wasn\u2019t a replacement. No one could ever replace the man she\u2019d loved. He understood, because in his own way he\u2019d loved Vaughn, too.</p><p>When they announced their engagement, Hassie had pulled away from Barbara. Neither spoke of it, but they both knew that their relationship had fundamentally changed and that their former closeness could no longer exist. Vaughn\u2019s parents didn\u2019t attend the wedding, although they\u2019d mailed a card and sent a generous check.</p><p>Barbara thought now that naming their son after Vaughn Knight had as much to do with Hassie as it did with their feelings for Vaughn. Perhaps she\u2019d hoped to bridge the distance between them....</p><p>Until he was twenty-one, Hassie had remembered Vaughn Kyle every year on his birthday, but that was the only time Barbara and Rick heard from her. When Rick accepted early retirement and they\u2019d decided to move back to North Dakota, Barbara recognized that, sooner or later, she\u2019d see Hassie again. A month or so after they\u2019d moved, Hassie had welcomed them with a brief note. It seemed fitting that Barbara\u2019s son had been the one to arrange this meeting, to bring them together again.</p><p>\u201cHassie wanted me to bring you to the house, instead of the pharmacy,\u201d Vaughn said as they left the quilting store.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re coming with us, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Barbara asked Carrie. She\u2019d quickly grasped that Vaughn was attracted to this woman, and she could understand why. However, she didn\u2019t pretend to know what was happening. Natalie had phoned several times, wanting to speak to Vaughn; she wasn\u2019t amused that he\u2019d apparently turned off his cell phone. Barbara didn\u2019t feel it was her place to inform the other woman that Vaughn was out with someone else. The situation concerned her, but she couldn\u2019t interfere and had to trust that he was treating both women with honesty and fairness.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to come to Hassie\u2019s with you,\u201d Carrie told them, \u201cbut I said I\u2019d fill in at the store for her. You two go and have a good visit, and I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><p>As they crossed the street, Carrie headed toward the pharmacy, and Barbara and Vaughn went in the opposite direction.</p><p>\u201cDoes the pharmacy still have the soda fountain?\u201d Barbara asked her son.</p><p>\u201cSure does. In fact, I thought I\u2019d leave you and Has-sie to visit, and I\u2019d steal away to Knight\u2019s to let Carrie fix me a soda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re spending a lot of time with her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Barbara couldn\u2019t resist asking.</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d</p><p>Barbara didn\u2019t answer him. There was probably some perfect maternal response, but darned if she knew what it was.</p><p>Hassie\u2019s house came into view, and Barbara automatically slowed her pace. It\u2019d been thirty-three years since she\u2019d walked up these steps. Thirty-three years since she\u2019d attended the wake, sat in a corner of the living room with Vaughn\u2019s older sister and wept bitter tears. At the end of a day that had been too long for all of them, Vaughn\u2019s mother had hugged her close and then instructed a family friend to make sure Barbara got safely home to Grand Forks.</p><p>\u201cMom?\u201d Vaughn studied her and seemed to sense that something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d she said. Funny how quickly those old emotions resurfaced. Her stomach churned as if it\u2019d been only a few months since she\u2019d last walked this path. But thirty-three years, a lifetime, had passed.</p><p>Hassie opened the door before Barbara could ring the bell. They stood there for a moment, gazing into each other\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Hassie smiled then, a welcoming smile that seemed to reach deep inside her with its warmth and generosity. \u201cBarbara,\u201d the older woman said, flinging open the screen door.</p><p>When she\u2019d entered the house, Hassie hugged her for long minutes, and Barbara felt the tears gather in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you came.\u201d Hassie finally released her and embraced Vaughn, who stood quietly behind his mother. \u201cI assume Vaughn told you about our visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. I can\u2019t tell you how honored we all are that you\u2019d give him Mr. Knight\u2019s gold watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seemed right that he have it.\u201d She took Barbara\u2019s coat and hung it in the hall closet. \u201cI won\u2019t take yours,\u201d she said to Vaughn, her back to them both. \u201cYou\u2019re probably planning to sneak over to the shop for a soda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was young once myself,\u201d Hassie said, and shooed him out the door. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCarrie\u2019s a wonderful young woman,\u201d Hassie told her as soon as Vaughn had left.</p><p>\u201cThey certainly seem to have taken a liking to one another,\u201d Barbara said noncommittally. She liked what she\u2019d seen of Carrie\u2014but what about Natalie? Well, that was Vaughn\u2019s business, she reminded herself again.</p><p>Hassie led her into the living room. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I\u2019ve already poured the tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p> <p>The silver service was set up on the coffee table and two delicate china cups were neatly positioned, steam rising from the recently poured tea. A plate of cookies had been placed nearby.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t often get an excuse to use my good tea service and china these days,\u201d Hassie murmured.</p><p>The two women sat side by side on the dark-blue sofa and sipped their tea. Neither really knew where to start, Barbara reflected. She took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of you often,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially since you were so generous with our son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have thought me a silly old woman, writing him little tidbits of advice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHassie,\u201d Barbara said, and touched Hassie\u2019s forearm. \u201cNo one could think that.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHe saved every birthday card you ever sent him. And he remembered what you wrote. He grew up honorable and generous, and I can\u2019t help thinking you played a part in that.\u201d</p><p>Hassie smiled her appreciation. \u201cNonsense, but it\u2019s very kind of you to say so.\u201d</p><p>Barbara glanced around the room. \u201cBeing here brings back so many memories,\u201d she said. The house, this room, was exactly as she remembered. She suspected that even after all these years, Vaughn\u2019s bedroom was virtually untouched. She remembered the high-school banner he had pinned to the wall and the bedroom set, old-fashioned even then. Valerie\u2019s old room was probably the same as it had been, as well, just like the rest of this house.</p><p>Hassie didn\u2019t comment, and Barbara sensed that the older woman had hung on to the past as much as she could and found comfort in what was familiar. Hassie\u2019s strength was considerable, but her loss had been too great. Losses, Barbara recalled. Jerry had died not long afterward, and Valerie had moved to Hawaii.</p><p>\u201cDo you like living in Grand Forks?\u201d Hassie asked, turning away from reminders of grief.</p><p>\u201cVery much. My parents leased out the house when they moved to Arizona. Rick and I always intended to move here one day, and I\u2019m really happy we did. This will be our first Christmas in North Dakota since Vaughn was five or six.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWith family again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, there\u2019ll only be Rick, Vaughn and me. All my family has moved away, and Gloria, our daughter, lives in Dallas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave Christmas here with me,\u201d Hassie urged, and then as if she regretted the impulse, she shook her head. \u201cNo, please forget I asked. I\u2019m sorry to impose. It\u2019s just the rambling of an old woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHassie, if you\u2019re serious, we\u2019d love nothing better than to spend the day with you.\u201d</p><p>Hassie\u2019s eyes shone. \u201cYou mean you\u2019d actually consider coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d be honored. I know Rick would love to see you again. He wanted to join me today, but he was already committed to something else\u2014some volunteer work he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about Christmas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery sure,\u201d Barbara insisted. \u201cBut I can\u2019t allow you to do all the cooking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d Hassie said, \u201cit\u2019s no problem. I\u2019d enjoy preparing my favorite recipes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll share the meal preparation, then,\u201d Barbara compromised, and Hassie aggreed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be having Christmas dinner,\u201d Barbara murmured, \u201cwith a dear, dear friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d enjoy more.\u201d</p><p>Barbara couldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Carrie found Leta tending Knight\u2019s Pharmacy when she arrived after saying goodbye to Vaughn and his mother.</p><p>\u201cThanks for filling in for me,\u201d she said, hurrying to the back of the store. She stored her coat and purse and pulled on her white jacket.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind staying,\u201d Leta told her. \u201cIn fact, Hassie asked me if I would. She thought you and Vaughn might like a few hours together.\u201d Leta wiped down the counter, and Carrie noticed how the other woman\u2019s eyes managed to evade hers.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you two being just a little obvious?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Leta said, \u201cbut we both think it\u2019s high time you got into circulation again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a library book?\u201d Carrie said with a grin. \u201cI\u2019ve been on the shelf too long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaugh if you want, but it\u2019s true. You\u2019ve been avoiding a social life. That\u2019s not good for a woman of your age.\u201d</p><p>Carrie was about to explain that, while she appreciated their efforts, she\u2019d already spent time with Vaughn. Before she could, though, the bell above the door chimed, and Lindsay Sinclair and her two daughters stepped into the warmth of the pharmacy.</p><p>\u201cGrandma.\u201d Four-year-old Joy ran toward Leta, who scooped the girl up in her arms for an enthusiastic hug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had the most incredible morning,\u201d Lindsay announced.</p><p>\u201cValue-X?\u201d Carrie asked.</p><p>Lindsay nodded. \u201cThe spokeswoman actually phoned me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called you?\u201d Leta asked, voice incredulous, as she set Joy back on the floor.</p><p>\u201cYes, and for some reason, she seemed to view me as a contact who represented the community. That\u2019s fine, since everyone in town shares my opinion.\u201d Lindsay removed her hat and shook out her hair. \u201cShe wanted me to understand that Value-X intends to be a good neighbor, quote, unquote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right!\u201d Carrie muttered sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just bet,\u201d Leta added. \u201cThey assume we\u2019re nothing but a bunch of dumb hicks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be fair,\u201d Lindsay said, glancing between the other two women, \u201cwe don\u2019t know what they think of us\u2014not that we have any interest in their opinion. But we are fully capable of mounting a campaign to keep them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thinking the same thing,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>\u201cOrganization is the key,\u201d Leta put in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be at the Cookie Exchange tonight, won\u2019t you?\u201d Lindsay asked Carrie. \u201cI know Leta will.\u201d She smiled at her mother-in-law. \u201cI thought that would be the best time to get all the women together. We can talk then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. Mom and I will be there for sure.\u201d The women\u2019s group at the church held the cookie exchange every Christmas. Joyce Dawson, the pastor\u2019s wife, had been instrumental in organizing the event, and every woman in town and the surrounding community could be counted on to attend.</p><p>\u201cValue-X won\u2019t know what hit them,\u201d Leta said happily.</p><p>The bell chimed a second time, and Vaughn entered the store. For a moment, he seemed startled to see the three women, but then his gaze sought out Carrie\u2019s. \u201cShould I come back later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Leta said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for Carrie to work today. I\u2019ve got everything covered.\u201d</p><p>Carrie was grateful for what her friends were trying to do, but she did have responsibilities. Leta seemed to read her thoughts. \u201cIf any prescriptions get phoned in, I\u2019ll find you,\u201d she promised. \u201cI\u2019ll leave a message with your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver hear the expression about not looking a gift horse in the mouth?\u201d Lindsay whispered.</p><p>\u201cWell, it appears I\u2019m not wanted or needed around here,\u201d Carrie said before Leta and Hassie\u2019s intentions became any plainer than they already were. She walked past Lindsay, who winked at her. After collecting her coat and purse, Carrie left with Vaughn.</p><p>\u201cWhere would you like to go?\u201d he asked as soon as they were outside.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t had lunch yet and suspected Vaughn hadn\u2019t, either. \u201cI know we had Italian yesterday, but I love pizza.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuffalo Valley has some of the best homemade pizza you\u2019ll ever eat.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his eyebrows. \u201cSounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>They started down the street, their pace relaxed. Snow had just begun to fall, drifting earthward in large, soft flakes. Christmas-card snow, Carrie thought. As they walked, she told him the story about Rachel\u2019s pizza, and how it had led to her restaurant and subsequent success.</p><p>\u201cYou mean she makes the sauce herself?\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded. \u201cI worked for Rachel one summer and I watched her make a batch. She starts with fresh tomatoes straight from her garden. It\u2019s amazingly good. I think she could sell her recipe, but of course, she doesn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>A pickup approached and slowed as it came alongside Vaughn and Carrie. Glancing over her shoulder, Carrie saw her two older brothers, Tom and Pete. She tried to ignore them, but that was impossible.</p><p>\u201cHey, Carrie,\u201d Tom called, leaning his elbow out the open passenger window.</p><p>She acknowledged his greeting with a short wave, hoping he\u2019d simply move on. Not that this was likely. Apparently Chuck and Ken had mentioned Vaughn, and now they, too, were looking for an introduction.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want us to meet your friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now,\u201d she called back, and sent Vaughn an apologetic glance. Because she was the only girl, all four of her brothers were protective of her, even more so after her divorce.</p><p>\u201cYou ashamed of your family?\u201d This came from Pete, who was driving.</p><p>Carrie sighed, praying that her brothers wouldn\u2019t say or do anything to further embarrass her. Pete parked the truck and both men climbed out, slamming their doors extra hard. Both wore thick winter coats and wool caps with the earflaps dangling. They were large men and did their best to appear intimidating.</p><p>She made the introductions, gesturing weakly toward her brothers. Vaughn stepped forward and shook hands with both of them.</p><p>\u201cNice to finally meet you,\u201d Tom said, resting his foot on the truck\u2019s bumper. \u201cNow I\u2019d like to know what your intentions are toward my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom!\u201d Furious, Carrie clenched her fists. \u201cThis is none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day you stop being my sister is the day I stop caring who you date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d Vaughn clearly had no idea what to say.</p><p>Her brothers putting him on the spot like this was outrageous. Picking up a handful of snow, Carrie immediately formed a ball and threw it at her oldest brother, hitting him square in the chest. Not waiting for his reaction, Carrie grabbed Vaughn\u2019s arm and shouted, \u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked for this, Carrie Ann,\u201d Tom shouted as Carrie and Vaughn raced across the street. They had just entered the park when Carrie felt her backside pelted by two snowballs.</p><p>\u201cThis is war,\u201d Vaughn yelled when he saw that she\u2019d been hit. He leaned down and packed his own snow, then hurled two balls in quick succession, hitting both Pete and Tom. Her brothers reacted with stunned surprise.</p><p>Laughing and dodging around the play equipment with her brothers in hot pursuit, Carrie had trouble keeping pace with Vaughn. He yelled instructions and pointed toward the back of Hamburger Heaven. The stand was closed for the winter and offered ample protection, but a few moments later, her brothers found them and began to bombard them with a flurry of snowballs. Although most of them hit the side of the building, it was obvious that Vaughn and Carrie couldn\u2019t stay there long. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou ready to surrender yet?\u201d Pete demanded.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Vaughn answered for them.</p><p>\u201cThis way,\u201d Carrie told him. With the community Christmas tree blocking their movements, she led him across the street. Hidden by a loaded hay truck that passed behind them, Carrie steered him toward her parents\u2019 store.</p><p>\u201cThis is what I\u2019d consider enemy territory,\u201d Vaughn whispered as they slipped behind the building and out of view.</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s the last place they\u2019ll look,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cSmart thinking.\u201d Vaughn beamed her a delighted smile.</p><p>She smiled back\u2014and realized she hadn\u2019t felt this kind of pure, uninhibited pleasure in...years. Since childhood, probably. When she didn\u2019t break eye contact and started to laugh, he said, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, not wanting to put into words the joy she felt.</p><p>A sound startled them both, and they froze. Carrie was certain her brothers had found them again, but if it was Pete and Tom, they left without searching farther.</p> <p>Relieved, Carrie sighed and slumped against the wall. \u201cI believe we\u2019re safe for the moment. Are you still interested in that pizza?\u201d</p><p>Vaughn nodded, but she saw a strange expression in his eyes as he continued to gaze down at her. Carrie tried to look away and couldn\u2019t. She knew he intended to kiss her, and she shut her eyes as he moved closer. She\u2019d been waiting for this moment, anticipating it. Wrapping her arms around his neck, she leaned into him. He drew off his gloves and then her wool hat and dropped them. Weaving his hands into her hair, he kissed her...and deepened the kiss until they were both breathless. Carrie trembled and buried her face in his shoulder. Neither spoke. As he held her tight, it seemed for those few moments that their hearts beat in unison.</p><p>He kissed her again, his mouth both firm and soft. When he eased away, Carried noticed that his brow had furrowed, and she thought she read doubt in his eyes. Uncertainty. She touched his face, wondering at the confusion she saw in him. \u201cIs anything wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He answered with a quick shake of his head. \u201cEverything is right.\u201d</p><p>And yet he sounded reluctant. She wanted to ask him more, but he moved away from her and peeked around the back wall. \u201cDo you think it\u2019s safe now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIt should be. Pete and Tom were just having fun with us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProtective older brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched over Gloria, too,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s two years younger than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust imagine that four times over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to,\u201d Vaughn said, ostentatiously brushing evidence of the snow battle from his sleeves.</p><p>They didn\u2019t see Pete or Tom on their way over, so Carrie assumed they\u2019d gone about their business. As she\u2019d told Vaughn, it\u2019d been all in fun and at least her brothers knew when to admit defeat.</p><p>Predictably enough, Vaughn raved about the pizza. In fact, he bought a second one to take home and reheat. When they\u2019d eaten, they returned to Hassie\u2019s, where his mother had just finished her visit. All four of them walked to where Vaughn had parked the car outside Sarah\u2019s quilt store. When they reached it, Hassie and Barbara Kyle hugged for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cThank you for coming,\u201d Hassie said, dabbing at her eyes.</p> <p>Carrie knew it had been an emotional visit for both women.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014thank you for...for being Hassie,\u201d Barbara said, and they hugged again. \u201cI\u2019ll be in touch about Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn opened the car door for his mother and helped her inside, an old-fashioned courtesy that reminded Carrie of her father and uncles.</p><p>Carrie stood on the sidewalk next to Hassie as Vaughn placed his pizza carefully on the back seat.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re coming to spend Christmas with me,\u201d Hassie said. \u201cI haven\u2019t looked forward to anything so much in years. It\u2019ll be like when the children were still home.\u201d</p><p>Carrie knew Hassie intended to spend Christmas morning with Bob and Merrily and little Bobby, but she\u2019d turned down invitations from almost everyone in town for dinner. Carrie was relieved that Hassie wouldn\u2019t spend the afternoon alone\u2014and she envied her Vaughn\u2019s company.</p><p>He climbed into the car beside his mother and started the engine. Before he backed out of the parking space, his eyes met Carrie\u2019s. She raised her hand and he returned the gesture. She felt as if her heart was reaching out to him...and his to her.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Hassie had been looking forward to this night. The Dawsons had moved to Buffalo Valley four years earlier; at that time the only church in town had been Catholic and was closed after Father McGrath\u2019s retirement. Then Reverend John Dawson and his wife had arrived.</p><p>What a blessing the couple had turned out to be! Joyce knew instinctively what to say to make people feel welcome. John\u2019s sermons were inspiring, and his advice was both sensitive and practical.</p><p>Her first Christmas in Buffalo Valley, Joyce had organized the Cookie Exchange, which had become a yearly event.</p><p>Hassie had baked oatmeal-cranberry cookies early that morning and set out a plate for her visit with Barbara. Both had gotten so involved in their conversation that they hadn\u2019t tasted a single one. Hassie shook her head, smiling. It was as though all those years of not seeing each other had simply vanished after their initial awkwardness had passed. The visit had gone by far too quickly; Barbara had to leave long before Hassie was ready. What amazed Hassie was that she\u2019d found herself saying things she hadn\u2019t even realized she felt.</p><p>Her daughter\u2019s decision to live in Hawaii was one example. She\u2019d never understood what had prompted Valerie\u2019s choice. Yes, there\u2019d been a job offer, but Valerie had pursued that job. The fact was, she\u2019d wanted to get as far away from North Dakota as she possibly could. Hassie understood this for the very first time.</p><p>When Barbara had inquired about Valerie, Hassie explained that her daughter had chosen to remove herself from the pain of losing her only brother and then her father. Never before had Hassie consciously acknowledged that. Yet the moment she said the words, she knew they were true.</p><p>Later that evening when Hassie got to the church for the Cookie Exchange, the place was blazing with light. Although she was twenty minutes early, the parking lot was already half-full. The first person she saw once she\u2019d set her platter of cookies on the table was Calla Stern. Sarah\u2019s once-rebellious daughter had become a lovely young woman. She was in her junior year of college now, if Hassie recalled correctly, and there was talk of her applying for admission to law school. She attended the University of Chicago and shared an apartment nearby, but at heart Calla remained a small-town girl.</p><p>As soon as Calla saw Hassie, she broke off her conversation and hurried across the room, arms outstretched.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you get home?\u201d Hassie asked, hugging her close.</p><p>\u201cThis afternoon. Oh, Hassie, I just heard about Value-X. What are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Calla, and this might shock you all, but I\u2019ve decided I\u2019m too old to fight them.\u201d</p><p>Calla frowned.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Leta told us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stand in the way of progress.\u201d If progress it is. Change, anyway. Perhaps if Hassie repeated that often enough, she might come to accept it. This wasn\u2019t what she wanted, but as she\u2019d learned long ago, the world didn\u2019t revolve around what she assumed was best.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s enjoy this evening,\u201d Hassie urged, \u201cand put these worries behind us until the new year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d the girl promised.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Hassie slid her arm through Calla\u2019s. \u201cNow tell me, are you still seeing Kevin?\u201d Calla had been dating Leta\u2019s boy off and on since her last year of high school.</p><p>\u201cOccasionally. He\u2019s so busy, and I\u2019m in school most of the time. Anyway, with him in Paris for six months...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalla would make a wonderful daughter-in-law,\u201d Leta said, joining them.</p><p>\u201cOh, you!\u201d Calla hugged her tightly, laughing as Hassie seconded Leta\u2019s remark.</p><p>\u201cStop it, you two,\u201d the girl chided. \u201cI\u2019m dating someone else at the moment and so is Kevin. We\u2019re good friends, but that\u2019s all. For now, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Leta muttered.</p><p>\u201cGive them time,\u201d Hassie told her.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Calla said with a soft smile, and after kissing them both, added, \u201cNow excuse me while I go mingle.\u201d</p><p>Hassie watched her leave. She thought Calla and Kevin would eventually get married, but probably not for some years. Not until educations were completed and careers launched. Still, they understood each other and shared the experience of having grown up in Buffalo Valley.</p><p>No sooner had Calla wandered off than Maddy appeared with four-year-old Julianne. She was heavily pregnant with her third child, but she\u2019d lost none of her composure or contentment.</p><p>\u201cMaddy,\u201d Hassie said, pleased to see her. \u201cHere, let me help you with all that.\u201d Maddy was juggling her coat and purse, plus a huge box of homemade cookies.</p><p>\u201cMommy, can I play with Joy?\u201d Julianne asked, tugging at Maddy\u2019s sleeve.</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart, and tell Lindsay I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s little Caleb?\u201d Hassie asked.</p><p>\u201cWith his daddy. After all, this is a girls\u2019 night out,\u201d Maddy said. Hassie knew this third pregnancy was as unexpected as their first. With three babies in five years, Jeb and Maddy were sure to have their hands full for quite a while.</p><p>Jeb\u2019s mother must be looking down from heaven, mighty pleased with her son, Hassie mused. Thanks to Maddy, he\u2019d gone from curmudgeonly recluse to good husband and proud father.</p><p>Hassie and Leta busied themselves arranging platters of cookies on the long tables. Joyce made several trips to the business office to run recipes off on the copier so they\u2019d be available for whoever wanted them.</p><p>Margaret Eilers and her daughter, Hailey, were among the last to arrive. Hailey, at three, bore a strong resemblance to her father and to her brother, David. Looking at Margaret and the child, no one would guess she wasn\u2019t the girl\u2019s birth mother. Hassie had nothing but praise for the way Matt and Margaret had worked out the awkward situation involving their children.</p><p>In the beginning Hassie hadn\u2019t been keen on Matt Eilers. No one in town held a high opinion of the rancher. But Margaret had fallen hard for Matt; she wanted to marry him and nothing would change her mind. After Bernard died and left her the ranch, Matt started seeing more and more of her. A few months later, there was a wedding. Then, lo and behold, Margaret turned up pregnant\u2014at the same time as that woman in Devils Lake.</p><p>The babies were born within a few weeks of each other, Hailey first and then little David. Hailey had been living with the couple for most of her three years. She was a darling little girl, which Hassie attributed primarily to the love and attention Margaret lavished on her.</p><p>The room rang with laughter and cheer, and Hassie basked in the sounds that ebbed and flowed around her. Her day had started early and been an emotional one. When she noticed chairs arranged along the wall, she slipped quietly off and sat down. A few minutes later Leta came to sit beside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust listen,\u201d Hassie said, closing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to be listening to?\u201d Leta asked.</p><p>\u201cThe joy,\u201d Hassie told her. \u201cThe friendship. These women are the very breath of this community.\u201d Hassie was grateful she\u2019d lived long enough to witness the town\u2019s reversal of fortunes. It was because of women like Lindsay and Rachel and Maddy and Sarah and Joanie Wyatt.... And maybe she herself had played a small part.</p><p>\u201cWhat I can\u2019t get over is all the babies,\u201d Leta said. \u201cFuture generations for Buffalo Valley.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRachel Quantrill is pregnant again,\u201d Hassie said, nodding at the young woman on the other side of the room talking with Sarah. Hassie was particularly fond of Rachel. She\u2019d watched the young widow struggle to get by after the death of her first husband. She\u2019d driven a school bus and worked as a part-time bookkeeper for Hassie. Later she\u2019d opened the pizza-delivery service. That was how she\u2019d met Heath. New to the banking business, Heath had rejected her loan application. His grandmother, who\u2019d started the bank, had been furious with him, Hassie recalled. But things had a way of working out for the best. Lily Quantrill had lived to see her grandson and Rachel marry. Rachel had brought a son into the marriage, and later she and Heath had a daughter they\u2019d named after Lily. A third child was expected in early summer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to remember that,\u201d Hassie murmured absently.</p><p>Leta gave her a puzzled look. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Hassie wasn\u2019t aware she\u2019d spoken aloud. \u201cAbout things working out for the best.\u201d Despite her efforts, her thoughts had returned to Value-X and the potential for disaster. All her hopes for this town and the people she loved so dearly were at stake.</p><p>\u201cYou feeling all right?\u201d Leta asked in a concerned tone.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Hassie assured her. \u201cJust tired. It\u2019s been a busy day.\u201d</p><p>Joyce Dawson sat down at the piano, and soon the room was filled with sweetly raised voices. The women and children gathered around, breaking naturally into two-part harmony. To Hassie it sounded as though the very angels from heaven were singing.</p><p>\u201cHassie\u2014\u201d Carrie Hendrickson crouched by her chair \u201c\u2014are you ill?\u201d</p><p>Leta answered for her. \u201cShe\u2019s just tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo wonder,\u201d Carrie murmured. \u201cShe was up before dawn baking cookies and then there was the visit from Barbara Kyle, plus a big order came in for the pharmacy.\u201d</p><p>Hassie grinned, amused that they spoke as if she wasn\u2019t even there.</p> <p>\u201cLet me walk you home,\u201d Carrie suggested, taking her hand.</p><p>\u201cFiddlesticks. I\u2019m perfectly capable of walking back on my own. No need for you to leave the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI insist,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cIt\u2019ll only take a few minutes and no one will miss me.\u201d</p><p>Hassie was weary, wearier than she cared to admit, so she agreed. Carrie retrieved their coats and led the way outside, sliding her arm through Hassie\u2019s to lend her support. They walked slowly, in companionable silence. The night sky was bright and clear, the stars scattered against it like diamonds. Most of the snow had been swept aside and the sidewalks salted.</p><p>As they crossed the street, a truck pulled up to the curb and rolled down the window. \u201cYou two need a ride?\u201d Chuck Hendrickson asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fine, thanks, anyway,\u201d Carrie told her brother.</p><p>\u201cSay, that fellow you had dinner with phoned a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be Vaughn,\u201d Hassie said. It did seem that Carrie and Vaughn were seeing a lot of each other, and that pleased her. From now on, Hassie resolved to look only at the positive side of things. She refused to let herself fret over situations she couldn\u2019t control.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call him back once I\u2019m finished over at the church,\u201d Carrie told her brother, who drove off.</p><p>\u201cYou could do worse, Carrie,\u201d Hassie said. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every man is another Alec.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said.</p><p>Hassie patted Carrie\u2019s hand. She would go home and think good thoughts for the young woman and for Buffalo Valley. Happy, positive thoughts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time you called,\u201d Natalie snapped. There\u2019d been no word of greeting.</p><p>Vaughn sat on the bed in his parents\u2019 guest room and pressed his cell phone to his ear. He felt guilty about not returning Natalie\u2019s repeated calls. He\u2019d delayed it, needing to put his thoughts in order first. He felt guilty about other things, too, but he didn\u2019t want to think about Carrie, not when he had to deal with Natalie.</p><p>No one in Buffalo Valley knew he\u2019d taken a job with Value-X. Not his parents. Not Hassie. And certainly not Carrie. His visit to North Dakota at a time when the company was considering an outlet in this area had seemed a fortuitous coincidence. Now it felt like the very opposite. He\u2019d agreed to check out the town, but that had been a mistake he regretted heartily. And Natalie was hounding him for information.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I should\u2019ve phoned sooner,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cYes, you should have.\u201d Her voice softened. \u201cI\u2019ve missed hearing from you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have an excuse to offer her, and the truth was...well, difficult to explain. Not only did he have serious doubts about working for this company, he\u2019d met Carrie, and the attraction between them was undeniable.</p><p>Just a few days ago his future had seemed assured, but now, after meeting Hassie and Carrie, his entire sense of what was right had been challenged. And his assumptions about love and marriage, about Natalie\u2014they\u2019d changed, too.</p><p>Natalie\u2019s voice was hard when she spoke again. \u201cI was beginning to wonder if I made a mistake recommending you for this position. I put my reputation on the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed I\u2019d been hired on my own merits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were but...\u201d She sighed heavily. \u201cLet\u2019s forget all that, shall we? I didn\u2019t know what to think when you didn\u2019t phone.\u201d She gave a stilted laugh. \u201cI realize you\u2019re not officially on the payroll until January, but it\u2019s so advantageous for you to be near this little town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe town has a name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d she said, and some of the stiffness returned to her voice. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Vaughn, but I\u2019ve had a trying day. Apparently Buffalo Valley is mounting opposition against Value-X.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d She slowly released her breath. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how hectic everything is here, with the holidays and everything else. Now this. I spoke with a woman in town. I can\u2019t remember her name exactly. Lesley, Lindy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLindsay Sinclair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve met her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe made the town\u2019s position very clear,\u201d Natalie continued. \u201cIt seems we\u2019ve got some public-relations work ahead of us. Okay, we can deal with that\u2014we\u2019ve done it before. We know how to present our case in a positive light. It won\u2019t take much to change their attitude, and really, at this point, they really don\u2019t have much choice.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn was sorry to hear that. So it was too late; Value-X had obviously succeeded in buying the property. This was what he\u2019d feared. \u201cLindsay told me Value-X is sending someone out after Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI volunteered for the job myself,\u201d she said, excited now. \u201cIt was providential, don\u2019t you think? I can meet your parents and settle this unfortunate matter with Buffalo Valley at the same time. Combine business with pleasure, in other words.\u201d She sounded pleased with herself for having so neatly arranged this trip. \u201cI\u2019ve got everything in motion for a Value-X campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019ll be willing to listen to the town\u2019s concerns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, of course I\u2019ll listen, but I\u2019m hoping to present our case, too. In fact, I\u2019ve already authorized a letter to be delivered to every family in Buffalo Valley. It\u2019s scheduled to arrive just after the first of the year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA letter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone thinks it\u2019s a great idea.\u201d Her satisfaction was unmistakable. \u201cI wrote it myself for a personal touch. I want the town to understand that they\u2019ve unfairly prejudged Value-X. I told them not to look at any negatives they might\u2019ve heard about the company, but at the positives\u2014everything we can do for their community. We plan to be a good neighbor.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn knew that Natalie\u2019s letter would most likely anger the people of Buffalo Valley, not reassure them. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you\u2019d signed the deal on the land,\u201d he muttered. Without being completely aware of it, Vaughn had held out hope that the controversy would die a natural death if the land deal fell through. His heart sank. It looked as if he\u2019d have no choice now but to get involved. The question was: on which side would he stand? If he followed his heart, he\u2019d join Hassie and Carrie in their fight, but if he did that, he\u2019d compromise his future with Value-X and Natalie...</p><p>Natalie hesitated before she answered. \u201cThere\u2019ve been a few snags with the property deal. Mr. Kohn isn\u2019t an easy man to work with.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn\u2019s relief was swift. So there was hope. \u201cThat\u2019s what I hear about Ambrose Kohn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you met him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he lives in Devils Lake. Listen, Natalie, I have to tell you I\u2019m not convinced Buffalo Valley is a good site.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but he could tell she wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cYou haven\u2019t even started work yet and you\u2019re already telling me my job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou chose Buffalo Valley as a development site?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure did,\u201d she said smugly. \u201cWe did a study on small towns that have shown substantial growth over the last five years. Buffalo Valley is a perfect target area for retail expansion.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn\u2019s hand tightened around the telephone receiver. \u201cThey don\u2019t have enough retail choices,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Apparently she hadn\u2019t noticed the sarcasm in his voice.</p><p>Vaughn felt tension creeping across his shoulders. He probably couldn\u2019t influence her to change her letter or withdraw it; he was in no position to tell Natalie news she didn\u2019t want to hear.</p><p>She returned to the subject of Ambrose Kohn. \u201cI\u2019m interested in what you know about him,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know him, but I have heard about him.\u201d Vaughn didn\u2019t feel comfortable saying anything more than he already had. As it was, he felt traitor enough.</p><p>\u201cHe will sign, and soon.\u201d Natalie\u2019s confidence sounded unshakable. \u201cThe transaction is as good as done.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn rotated his neck in order to ease the tension.</p><p>\u201cI know what\u2019s happened,\u201d she said, catching him by surprise. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen this little town and now you have doubts that Value-X is doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>It was as though she\u2019d read his mind. He found himself nodding.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re confused,\u201d Natalie continued. \u201cIt happens to a lot of us when we first hire on with the company. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s something we all work through. Trust me, Vaughn, Value-X knows what it\u2019s doing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBuffalo Valley is afraid of losing its character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery town is in the beginning.

Vaughn rubbed his hand down his face. Still sitting on the edge of his bed, he tilted his head back to stare up at the ceiling. This was really bad.</p><p>Value-X had no intention of listening to the concerns of Buffalo Valley\u2019s citizens. In its arrogance, the retailer had decided on a course of action, one that reflected solely its own interests.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing you,\u201d Natalie told him, lowering her voice seductively.</p><p>It was almost more than Vaughn could do to echo the sentiment.</p><p>When he finished the conversation, he returned to the kitchen to find his mother dishing up ice cream.</p><p>\u201cYou interested?\u201d she asked, holding up the scoop.</p><p>\u201cSure, why not?\u201d he muttered. He took a third bowl from the cupboard and handed it to this mother, who pried open the carton lid.</p> <p>\u201cTell me more about Natalie,\u201d she said.</p><p>Vaughn didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cYou\u2019ll meet her soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s joining us after Christmas, right?\u201d She studied him hard, and Vaughn knew what she was thinking. He\u2019d spent almost every day of the past week with Carrie. He was with one woman and had another waiting in the wings\u2014that was how it looked. His mother\u2019s eyes filled with questions.</p><p>\u201cNatalie is coming, then?\u201d she repeated when he didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cSo it seems.\u201d He sighed. She\u2019d show up even if he asked her to stay home. Value-X was paying for the trip.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound too happy about it,\u201d his mother murmured, her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat about Carrie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, but I can\u2019t help wondering if you\u2019re really sure of what you want. I saw the look Carrie gave you as we left Buffalo Valley earlier today.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn frowned.</p><p>\u201cShe deserves your honesty.\u201d</p><p>He was in full agreement; he owed Carrie the truth, and not only about his relationship with Natalie. He had to tell her about Value-X.</p><p>As soon as his mother left the kitchen, Vaughn reached for the phone. Unfortunately Carrie wasn\u2019t home. He recalled now that she\u2019d mentioned something about meeting with the church women\u2019s group, but that\u2019d slipped his mind. He left a message with one of her brothers.</p><p>After that, he joined his parents in the living room. He settled on the sofa next to his mother and focused his attention on a television show about Christmas traditions around the world.</p><p>An hour later the phone pealed and his mother automatically rose to answer it. She returned almost immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s Carrie for you.\u201d</p> <p>Vaughn went into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said excitedly when he picked up the receiver. \u201cI just got back from the Cookie Exchange and got your message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, as usual. There was a lot of talk about this Value-X problem. We\u2019re going to take active measures to keep the company out of town.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d given him the perfect lead. This was his chance to explain the whole confused mess. But Vaughn didn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t, not over the phone. It was something that needed to be said face-to-face, he decided. Okay, so he was a coward.</p><p>Carrie seemed to be waiting for a response, so to keep the conversation going, he asked, \u201cWhat can be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Hassie, nothing. She\u2019s afraid we can\u2019t win, especially after everything she\u2019s heard and read. According to all the news stories, the company practically always comes out on top. Still, there are a few towns that didn\u2019t give in, including one in Montana, I think.\u201d She paused. \u201cHassie\u2019s real problem is that she\u2019s just tired out. But I\u2019m not, and neither are the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn could hear the fighting spirit in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI suggest you start with Ambrose Kohn.\u201d That was probably more than he should\u2019ve said, but the words escaped before he could judge their wisdom.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having an organizational meeting as soon as it can be arranged, and I\u2019ll recommend that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he mumbled, wishing he could tell her he didn\u2019t want to hear any of this. It put him in a terrible position. He\u2019d be a traitor to Value-X and Natalie if he withheld these facts, and a traitor to Carrie if he relayed them.</p><p>\u201c...tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Vaughn said, trapped in his own dilemma. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you come? It\u2019s the high-school play. I know it doesn\u2019t sound like much, but we\u2019re all proud of it. The play\u2019s about the history of Buffalo Valley and the families that settled here. It\u2019ll give you a feel for the town.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn\u2019s own great-grandparents on his mother\u2019s side had settled in the Dakotas in the late 1800s. He pondered Carrie\u2019s words. Knowing more about the town\u2019s past might help him decide what to do about his relationship with Value-X\u2014and Natalie. It was a faint hope\u2014and maybe just another delaying tactic\u2014but he had nothing else to cling to.</p><p>\u201cWill you come as my guest?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d</p><p>She gave him the details and Vaughn hung up the phone feeling as vulnerable and unsure as ever.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d his mother asked when he returned to the living room.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he muttered. \u201cJust fine.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>The theater was filled to capacity. People crowded the aisle, chatting and visiting with one another. Carrie had been fortunate to get good seats for herself and Vaughn, thanks to Lindsay Sinclair.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know there were this many people in Buffalo Valley,\u201d Vaughn said, twisting around to glance over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t. Folks come from all over. The Cowans drove down from Canada. Her great-grandmother is one of the main characters in the play.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn looked at his program. \u201cSo, Lindsay Sinclair is the producer and director of Dakota Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded. \u201cLindsay\u2019s the person responsible for all this,\u201d she said, gesturing toward her friend. \u201cNone of it would\u2019ve happened without her.\u201d</p><p>Carrie went on to explain how the play had been created and described everything Lindsay had done to make sure it got performed. At the end of the story she told him that the theater belonged to Ambrose Kohn.</p><p>\u201cThe Ambrose Kohn?\u201d Vaughn\u2019s brows arched.</p><p>\u201cWhen Lindsay first arrived, the theater was nothing but cobwebs and dirt. She was a first-year teacher and one of the stipulations when she accepted the job was that the community would pitch in and help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn whatever way she required. She asked the town\u2019s older people to talk to the kids. It started with Joshua McKenna. At the time he was president of the town council, plus he knows quite a bit of local history. After that, Lindsay lined up community representatives to come to the school on Friday afternoons. Joshua was the one who gave her the idea of having the kids write the play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe high-schoolers wrote the play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe original script was created by the kids Lindsay taught six years ago. Each new group of students refines it a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the sixth year?\u201d He glanced around with what appeared to be renewed appreciation. \u201cPretty impressive audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fabulous play. Why else would so many people return year after year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love all of it. There\u2019s a scene early on when a tornado hits the town and everything\u2019s destroyed. The people lose heart. Entire crops are wiped out and families are left homeless. You can just feel their agony.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean to get carried away, but no matter how often she\u2019d seen it, the scene brought tears to Carrie\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens then?\u201d Vaughn asked.</p><p>\u201cEveryone pulls together. The people whose fields were spared share their crops with the ones who lost everything. With everyone working together, they rebuild the farms destroyed in the tornado and save the town.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn nodded slowly. \u201cTeamwork,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cThat was a message that really hit home for all of us. So many of the farmers continue to struggle financially. The play helped remind us that we need to work together. Then and now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you talking about Value-X?\u201d</p><p>Carrie shook her head. \u201cNot only Value-X. We have more problems than just that. As you probably know, farm prices are low and have been for years. Most folks around here feel that no one appreciates the contribution of the small farmer anymore. A lot of people were demoralized by what was happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it better now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but only because farmers in the area have banded together. They still aren\u2019t getting decent prices for their crops, but they\u2019ve found ways around that.\u201d</p><p>Carrie looked away; she had to swallow the lump in her throat. Her own family had been forced off the farm. The land had produced record yields, and it still wasn\u2019t enough to make ends meet. After several years of dismal wheat prices, the family had realized the farm could no longer support them all. That was when her parents and younger brothers had moved into town.</p><p>This had happened shortly after she\u2019d filed for divorce. At first it had seemed inevitable that they\u2019d have to sell the land, but then her two older brothers had decided to lease it. Pete and Tom were married by this time, and along with their wives, they\u2019d made the decision to stay.</p><p>Buffalo Valley had started to show signs of new life\u2014with the reopening of the hotel and bar, as well as Rachel\u2019s pizza restaurant. And Lindsay, of course, had brought fresh hope to the community in so many ways....</p><p>Carrie\u2019s mother had come into a small inheritance, and her parents chose to invest it in a business. Buffalo Valley was badly in need of an all-purpose hardware store. Carrie\u2019s father felt confident that if people could shop locally, they would, so the family had risked everything with this venture. To date, it had been a wise choice, but now with the mega-chain threatening to swallow up smaller businesses, the Hendricksons were in grave danger of losing it all.</p><p>\u201cThe American farmer refuses to be discounted,\u201d Carrie said, clearing her throat. \u201cWhen was the last time you purchased pasta?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPasta? As in noodles?\u201d Vaughn asked in a puzzled voice. \u201cNot recently. What makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver hear of Velma brand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say I have.\u201d</p><p>Carrie tucked her arm through his. \u201cIt\u2019s made with wheat grown right here in Buffalo Valley. Brandon Wyatt and Gage Sinclair are part of the program. A year ago they joined several other local farmers, including my brothers, and some not so local, and cut out the middleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean a group of farmers decided to start their own pasta company?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I mean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIngenious,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cIncredible. So that\u2019s what you were talking about when you said they\u2019d found ways around the poor prices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. There\u2019s often a solution\u2014but sometimes you have to find it yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarrie.\u201d</p><p>Carrie looked up to see Lindsay and Gage Sinclair standing in the aisle near them.</p> <p>Carrie started to make the introductions, then remembered that Vaughn had met Lindsay in the pharmacy two days before.</p><p>\u201cVaughn, this is my husband, Gage,\u201d Lindsay said.</p><p>Vaughn stood and held out his hand to Gage. He and Carrie made their way into the aisle.</p><p>\u201cI understand you\u2019re an Airborne Ranger,\u201d Gage said.</p><p>\u201cWas,\u201d Vaughn corrected.</p> <p>The two men began a conversation about military life, and Lindsay stepped closer to Carrie.</p><p>\u201cThanks for getting us such great seats,\u201d Carrie said. Lindsay was a substitute teacher now but still worked on the play every year.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Lindsay glanced pointedly at Vaughn. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>Carrie didn\u2019t know how to answer. Her divorce had devastated her, and since then she\u2019d thrown herself into her studies, forging ahead, insulating her heart. She\u2019d been protecting herself from any risk of pain, but at the same time she\u2019d eliminated any hope of finding love. Then Vaughn entered her life. His patience with Hassie had touched her. His willingness to hear her concerns about the changes that seemed to be coming to Buffalo Valley inspired her to fight for what she knew was right.</p><p>Carrie looked at Vaughn and sighed. \u201cHe gives me hope,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI remember the first time I saw Gage,\u201d Lindsay whispered back. \u201cHe looked at me and...I know it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, but it was as if someone had zapped me with an electrical jolt. I didn\u2019t even know this man\u2019s name and it was as though I\u2019d connected with him.\u201d</p> <p>The music started and Gage reached for Lindsay\u2019s hand. \u201cWe\u2019d better find our seats.\u201d</p><p>Gage and Lindsay left, and Carrie and Vaughn returned to their own seats. No sooner had they settled in than the curtain went up.</p><p>Several times during the evening, Carrie caught Vaughn studying her. She felt his eyes on her, and when she turned to meet his gaze, he took her hand and entwined his fingers with hers. Carrie had the sensation that something was troubling him, but now wasn\u2019t the time to ask.</p><p>\u201cKids in high school actually wrote the play themselves?\u201d Vaughn asked Carrie for the second time. He found it difficult to believe that a group of teenagers could have created and put on such a high-quality production. The acting was a bit amateurish, true, but the emotion and heart that went into each scene stirred him more than he would\u2019ve thought possible.</p><p>After seeing the play, Vaughn realized he could no longer evade a decision regarding Value-X. Not after these vivid depictions of the struggles Buffalo Valley had faced. Through the years, bad weather and bouts of pestilence had plagued the land. The tales of the \u201cdust bowl\u201d years had given him a small taste of the hopelessness the farmers endured. The play ended with a farm family standing in the middle of a wheat field, their heads held high, their arms linked. Just thinking about that scene raised goose bumps on his arms.</p><p>\u201cHigh-school kids,\u201d he repeated before Carrie could respond.</p><p>\u201cIt was as good as I said it was, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>Words fell short of describing the powerful sensation he\u2019d experienced throughout the play.</p> <p>\u201cWould you like to come over to Buffalo Bob\u2019s for hot cider? A lot of folks do,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cBut I should warn you, Pete and Tom will be there.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn would enjoy going another round with Carrie\u2019s brothers, but unfortunately he had a long drive back to Grand Forks. \u201cAnother time,\u201d he told her. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to socialize.</p><p>As they stepped from the warmth of the theater into the cold night air, his breath became visible in foggy wisps. The cold seemed to press against him with an intensity he hadn\u2019t expected.</p><p>\u201cLet me get you home,\u201d Vaughn said, placing his arm around her. He wasn\u2019t accustomed to cold so severe it made his lungs ache just to draw a breath.</p><p>Carrie wrapped her scarf more securely about her neck and pulled on her wool hat. Normally they would have walked the short distance, but not when the cold was so bitter, the wind so vicious.</p><p>Vaughn helped her into his rental car, then hurried around the front and climbed into the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>Neither spoke as he drove the few short blocks to her family\u2019s home. Vaughn wondered if Carrie had realized no one would be there. The house was dark. Had he asked, she would\u2019ve invited him inside, but he preferred talking to her there, in the dark.</p><p>\u201cCarrie, listen, there\u2019s something I have to tell you.\u201d He stared straight ahead, unable to look at her.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re going to say.\u201d</p><p>He jerked his gaze to hers. Her blue eyes were barely visible in the moonlight, but he saw enough to be aware that she only thought she knew.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other a very short time,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be leaving soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He could hear her surprise and embarrassment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to speak out of turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the same time, it has everything to do with us,\u201d he said, and slid his arm around her neck and drew her to him. He breathed in her scent\u2014clean and light and floral; he felt her body against him, softly yielding. After a moment of debating the wisdom of what he was about to do, he exhaled harshly.</p><p>\u201cVaughn, what is it?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know where he\u2019d find the courage to tell her. She raised her head to look at him, her eyes full of warmth and concern. Kissing her was wrong; he knew it even as he lowered his mouth to hers. He didn\u2019t care, he had to kiss her one last time before he was forced to watch the transformation that would come over her when she learned the truth. In a few seconds he was going to hurt and disillusion her.</p><p>His mouth was on hers with excitement, with need. The kiss was intense. Real. It seemed to him that the woman in his arms had flung open her life for him, and that thought left his senses reeling.</p><p>The guilt he felt was nearly overwhelming.</p><p>Her hat had fallen off, and Vaughn slipped his fingers into her hair. He held her close, refusing to release her. From the way she clung to him, she didn\u2019t want him to let her go.</p><p>\u201cTell me?\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>\u201cCarrie...\u201d He shut his eyes and held his breath for a moment. \u201cI came to Buffalo Valley for more reasons than you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Hassie, yes, but...I\u2019d also been asked to check on something for a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck on what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only way to say this is straight out. I work for Value-X.\u201d</p><p>Carrie froze. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, her voice confused. Uncomprehending.</p><p>\u201cValue-X\u2019s corporate headquarters are in Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were just discharged from the army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him and scraped the hair back from her face as though to see him more clearly. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to. I took a job with Value-X after my discharge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey sent you here?\u201d Her back was stiff now, and she leaned away from him. A moment earlier she couldn\u2019t get close enough, and now she was as far from him as the confines of the vehicle would allow. \u201cAre your parents involved in this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! They don\u2019t even know.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head over and over, raising both hands to her face. \u201cI need to think,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t officially start with the company until January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a spy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The vice president of new development asked me to check out the town. I was going to be in the area, anyway. It made perfect sense, and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you did.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t very well deny it. \u201cYou have every right to be furious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn straight I do,\u201d she said, grabbing the door handle.</p><p>Vaughn stopped her by reaching for her hand. \u201cI can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cCan\u2019t do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork for Value-X. I\u2019m faxing in my resignation first thing tomorrow morning.\u201d No one would be in the office to read it until after Christmas, but that couldn\u2019t be helped.</p><p>Carrie still appeared stunned. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI need time to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I know this is a shock. I won\u2019t blame you if you decide you want nothing more to do with me. That decision is yours.\u201d He sincerely hoped his honesty would prove his sincerity.</p><p>She climbed out of the car and without another word, ran toward the house. Vaughn waited at the curb until she was safely inside and then, with a heavy heart, he drove back to Grand Forks.</p><p>His parents were still up, playing a game of Scrabble at the kitchen table, when he walked in.</p><p>His mother looked up and smiled. \u201cHow was the play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he answered.</p><p>His father picked up four new alphabet squares. \u201cI heard it was put on by a bunch of kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, but they did an incredible job.\u201d Vaughn turned a chair around and straddled it.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Carrie?\u201d his mother asked innocently enough.</p><p>Vaughn\u2019s response was so long in coming that Barbara frowned. She seemed about to repeat her question when he spoke, intending to forestall her.</p><p>\u201cIf no one minds,\u201d he said quickly, \u201cI think I\u2019ll go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d his father said, concentrating on the game.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want a cup of tea first?\u201d his mother asked, still frowning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d he said.</p><p>Inside the guest room, Vaughn threw himself on the bed. The guilt and remorse that had haunted him on the sixty-minute drive from Buffalo Valley hadn\u2019t dissipated.</p><p>He folded his hands beneath his head and gazed up at the ceiling, his thoughts twisting and turning as he attempted to reason everything out. Now that Carrie knew the truth, he should feel better, but he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Resigning from Value-X was only a small part of what he had to do. He wouldn\u2019t be this attracted to Carrie if he truly loved Natalie. He closed his eyes and could only imagine what Natalie would say once she discovered what he\u2019d done. Avoiding a confrontation with her would be impossible. She was coming to Buffalo Valley, and what was that old adage? Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. He could feel the flames licking at his feet even now. Oh, yes, this was only the beginning.</p><p>He trusted that Carrie would eventually forgive him for his deception concerning Value-X and his role with the company. He\u2019d been as candid with her as he could.</p><p>Unfortunately Value-X wasn\u2019t the only issue. He didn\u2019t have the courage to tell Carrie about Natalie. Not yet. He didn\u2019t want to force her to accept more than one disappointment at a time. Once she\u2019d dealt with the fact that he was connected with Value-X, he\u2019d explain his relationship to Natalie. By then, that relationship would be over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sitting up, Vaughn swung his legs over the side of the bed and sat there for several minutes. His mind wasn\u2019t going to let him sleep, so it was a waste of time to even try.</p><p>The kitchen light was off when he stepped into the hallway. He assumed his parents had finished their game and retired for the night. Perhaps if he had something to eat, it might help him relax. To his surprise, he found his father sitting in the darkened living room, watching the late-night news. The Christmas tree in the corner twinkled with festive lights that illuminated the gifts piled beneath.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d gone to bed,\u201d his father said.</p><p>\u201cI thought I had, too,\u201d Vaughn answered, joining him. They both stared at the screen, although there was nothing on except a too-familiar commercial. Yet anyone might have thought they were viewing it for the first time.</p> <p>His father suddenly roused himself and turned off the TV. \u201cSomething on your mind?\u201d he asked after an uncomfortable moment of silence.</p><p>Vaughn hesitated, wondering if he should share his burden.</p><p>His father yawned loudly. \u201cYou\u2019d better start talking soon if you\u2019re inclined to do so, because I\u2019m about to hit the sack.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn laughed despite himself. \u201cGo to bed. This is something I\u2019ve got to settle myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Rick Kyle told him. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure...\"</p> <p>\u201cNight, Dad,\u201d Vaughn said, grateful for having been raised by two loving parents.</p><p>\u201cYou coming to bed or not?\u201d Gage Sinclair called to his wife. Lindsay had been fussing ever since they\u2019d driven back to the farm. After they\u2019d put the girls down for the night, she\u2019d decided to sort laundry. Then it was something in the kitchen. He had no idea what she was up to now.</p><p>\u201cLindsay,\u201d he shouted a second time, already in bed himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d Her voice came from the living room.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said fifteen minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Tossing aside the comforter, he got out of bed and reached for his robe before walking into the other room. Sure enough, he found her sitting on the sofa, knitting. This particular project looked like it was going to be a sweater for Joy. \u201cTell me what\u2019s bothering you,\u201d he said, sinking down in his recliner.</p> <p>\u201cThings,\u201d she returned a moment later.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not upset with me, are you?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her knitting and stared at him. \u201cHas there ever been a time I was afraid to tell you exactly what I thought, Gage Sinclair?\u201d</p><p>Gage didn\u2019t have to consider that for very long. \u201cNo,\u201d he said decisively.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d he pressed. All at once he knew. The answer should have been obvious. \u201cValue-X?\u201d</p><p>His wife nodded. \u201cMy mind\u2019s been buzzing ever since I talked to the company. That woman was so arrogant. I don\u2019t doubt for a moment that Value-X will be as ruthless as they need to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, there isn\u2019t anything we can do about it now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but I can\u2019t stop thinking. We\u2019ve got to get organized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that with Christmas only a few days away, everyone\u2019s so busy we can\u2019t find even a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what happens this time of year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the future of the entire town is at risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think other towns have tried to keep them out?\u201d He didn\u2019t mean to be a pessimist, but truth was truth. No matter what kind of slant they put on it, nothing was going to change.</p><p>\u201cWhat worries me most is Hassie\u2019s attitude,\u201d Lindsay admitted. \u201cI\u2019ve never known her to give up without one hell of a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, she\u2019s single-handedly slayed dragons for this town. It\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d This was said with a sadness that tugged at his heart. Gage knew his wife had a special relationship with Hassie. He also knew that without Hassie Knight, he might never have married Lindsay. Now it was impossible to imagine his life without her and their daughters. It wasn\u2019t anything he even wanted to contemplate.</p><p>\u201cI saw you talking to Maddy,\u201d Gage said. The two women had been friends nearly all their lives, and they still relied on each other when either had a problem. This problem, though, was shared by the whole town. Predictably, Lindsay had taken on Buffalo Valley\u2019s latest dilemma\u2014taken on Hassie\u2019s role, too, he thought.</p><p>That was what he loved about her, and at the same time dreaded. His wife didn\u2019t know the meaning of the word no. She simply refused to give up. When she\u2019d first moved to Buffalo Valley, they\u2019d been constantly at odds; he was crazy about her, yet couldn\u2019t say a word to her without an argument erupting.</p><p>They\u2019d met one hot summer afternoon at Hassie\u2019s. Lindsay had left town but she\u2019d stayed in his mind. For weeks afterward she filled his thoughts, and if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, she invaded his dreams. When he learned she\u2019d accepted the teaching position at the high school, he managed to convince himself that this Southern belle wouldn\u2019t last longer than the first snowflake. His behavior toward her had been scornful, even combative\u2014an attempt to keep from making a fool of himself. It hadn\u2019t worked, since he\u2019d done a mighty fine job of looking like a dolt.</p><p>Then there was the matter of finding their aunt, the illegitimate child of her grandmother and his grandfather. Gage had wanted no part of that. He\u2019d violently disagreed with her decision to intrude on this unknown woman\u2019s life.</p><p>He\u2019d been wrong about that, and during the past few years, Angela Kirkpatrick had become an important figure in their lives.</p><p>It didn\u2019t stop there. Lindsay had known what was best for Kevin, too. His much younger brother was never meant to be a farmer. Kevin hated what Gage loved most. But Kevin\u2019s talent meant that he would one day be named among the country\u2019s major artists. Lindsay had recognized his brother\u2019s gift when Gage had turned a blind eye to it.</p><p>Having seen the error of his ways\u2014repeatedly\u2014Gage had come to trust his wife\u2019s judgment and intuition. \u201cWhat do you suggest we do?\u201d he asked, getting up and sitting next to her on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t know, and neither does Maddy,\u201d Lindsay told him, shrugging helplessly. She put aside her knitting, muttering that she couldn\u2019t concentrate anymore. Not his fault, she assured him. It was just this Value-X thing.</p><p>He clasped her hand and she gripped his hard. She scrambled into his lap, pressing her head against his shoulder. Gathering her close, Gage savored the feel of his wife in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI tried to talk to Hassie about it, but she said I should turn my thinking around and try to look at the positive side of the situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d Gage asked, dropping a kiss on her forehead.</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t get past what\u2019ll happen to Buffalo Valley once Value-X arrives.\u201d</p><p>The prospects for the future weren\u2019t bright in view of what had become of other communities the retailer had entered.</p><p>Neither spoke for several moments, then Gage changed the subject. \u201cI enjoyed meeting Vaughn Kyle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two certainly seemed to hit it off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got to talking about army life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if he moved to Buffalo Valley and he and Carrie got married?\u201d his wife said. Sometimes he forgot what a romantic she could be. And yet...time and again, her instincts about people proved to be correct. She was the one who\u2019d claimed Maddy and Jeb were falling in love, although Gage would\u2019ve sworn on a stack of Bibles that it wasn\u2019t happening.</p><p>\u201cCarrie and Vaughn?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cMark my words, Gage.\u201d</p><p>Lindsay wasn\u2019t going to get an argument out of him. \u201cYou ready for bed now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d she told him, kissing his jaw and sending shivers down his back.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a meeting in town this morning,\u201d Margaret Eilers announced at the breakfast table Saturday morning, three days before Christmas.</p><p>This came as news to Matt. His wife hadn\u2019t mentioned anything about going into Buffalo Valley. Something was in the air, though. The phone had been ringing off the hook for the better part of a week. He knew the women around here were up in arms about the Value-X problem, although Matt didn\u2019t see what could be done. Neither did any of the other men in town.</p><p>\u201cCan you watch the kids for me, Sadie?\u201d His wife smiled at the housekeeper, who\u2019d been with the family since Margaret\u2019s childhood.</p><p>Sadie brought a stack of pancakes to the table and wiped her hands on her apron. \u201cNot this morning,\u201d she said in that brusque way of hers.</p><p>Anyone who didn\u2019t know Sadie might assume she was put out by the request. She wasn\u2019t. This was simply her manner, and they were all used to it. Matt had learned more than one lesson from the highly capable housekeeper. She\u2019d become an ally and friend shortly after he married Margaret, and he was forever grateful for all she\u2019d done to see him through his troubles.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving at noon, remember?\u201d Sadie reminded them.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Margaret muttered, glancing at Matt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in town?\u201d he asked. Margaret wasn\u2019t one to make unnecessary trips, nor was she the type of woman to find an excuse to shop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m meeting with the other women. We\u2019re going to discuss ideas on how to deal with the threat from Value-X,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, that\u2019s already been discussed to death. The town council has tried, Hassie\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s been talking to Ambrose Kohn individually. We\u2019ve got to mount a defense as a community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do what? Sign petitions?\u201d He didn\u2019t mean to sound negative, but he sincerely doubted that Value-X cared what the community thought. They\u2019d already set the wheels in motion. Matt suspected many a town such as theirs had tried to mount a defense, but it had been hopeless from the start. Value-X knew how to win.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t sit by and do nothing,\u201d Margaret insisted.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s almost Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly, and Value-X is counting on the community to delay a response until after the holidays. By then it could be too late. That\u2019s what the meeting\u2019s about. I\u2019m willing to fight now, and so are the other women in town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join us, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the women are spearheading this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because none of you men believe it can be done.\u201d Her smile belied the sharpness of her words. \u201cYou can still come if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Matt said, waving a hand in dismissal. \u201cI\u2019ve got the kids to look after.\u201d</p><p>Margaret smiled and reached over to spear a hot-cake with her fork. They\u2019d been married three years, and Matt fell more in love with her every day. Times had been hard in the beginning, but it seemed that once they\u2019d survived that rough period, they\u2019d grown closer than ever. Of one thing Matt was certain\u2014his wife brought out the very best in him. He loved her with an intensity that gave him strength. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo I can leave Hailey and David with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did have plans this morning, but they can wait.\u201d He\u2019d hoped to finish the gift he was working on for Margaret. The antique rocker had belonged to her father. Matt had stumbled upon it in the loft up in the barn, and Sadie had told him its history. Joshua McKenna had repaired it earlier, and Matt had sanded and varnished the wood. Sadie had sewed new cushions for the seat and back. Matt had hoped to add a final coat of varnish that morning so it would be ready for Margaret on Christmas morning. Well...he\u2019d have to find time tonight.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you women think you\u2019re going to accomplish,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if you sincerely believe it\u2019ll make a difference, then I\u2019ll do my part\u2014and I\u2019ll wish you well.\u201d</p><p>Margaret thanked him with a brilliant smile, rose from the table and kissed him. The kiss was deep and full of promise. She was letting him know he\u2019d be rewarded a hundred times over at a more appropriate hour.</p> <p>Soon afterward Margaret headed into town. Once the kids were up, dressed and fed, Matt decided he wanted to know exactly what the women intended. Reaching for the phone, he called Jeb McKenna, his closest neighbor.</p><p>\u201cIs Maddy gone, too?\u201d he asked. Matt heard children crying in the background.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my hands full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Matt confessed.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what they\u2019re planning?\u201d Jeb asked.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a clue, but I\u2019m sorry now that I didn\u2019t go with her. They have great intentions, but what can they do that hasn\u2019t already been tried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou signed the petition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlong with everyone else in town,\u201d Matt told him.</p><p>\u201cBuffalo Bob contacted the governor and asked for help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he hear back?\u201d Now, that was promising.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p> <p>Matt sighed impatiently. \u201cI feel like we should be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy.\u201d Hailey tugged at his jeans. \u201cCan we go to town and have a soda?\u201d</p><p>Matt grinned at his daughter. \u201cJust a minute, honey.\u201d What an inspiration. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you at the soda fountain,\u201d Matt suggested. \u201cThat way we can keep the kids occupied and we can talk ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Jeb said.</p><p>Matt pushed a tape into the truck\u2019s console and sang Christmas songs with his children as he drove into town. When he parked outside Hassie\u2019s, he noticed several other vehicles there, too. The two youngsters followed him excitedly into the drugstore.</p><p>The soda fountain appeared to be the most popular place in town; Gage Sinclair was there with his two daughters, and Jeb McKenna had arrived ahead of him. So had Brandon Wyatt and six-year-old Jason. Every stool at the fountain was occupied.</p><p>Matt acknowledged his friends with a quick nod.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Matt,\u201d Jeb said in a jocular tone, \u201cseeing that you called us together, I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ve come up with a few ideas to share.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Matt glanced at Jeb, who shifted his weight. \u201cI called a couple of the other guys, too. I think we made a mistake by taking such a negative attitude. Now the women are stuck trying to cope with the problem all by themselves.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Dennis Urlacher walked in with his three-year-old son. Little Josh might be named after Sarah\u2019s father, but he was the spitting image of his own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not late, am I?\u201d Dennis asked, taken aback by the sight of all the children.</p><p>Leta was doing her best to keep up with orders, but she was obviously overwhelmed. As soon as she delivered one soda, she got an order for two more. Apparently Hassie was at the meeting over at Sarah\u2019s shop, as well. The men stood in a small circle while the children sat at the counter. Their joyous laughter made all the fathers smile, none more than Matt.</p><p>\u201cSo, does anyone have any ideas?\u201d Dennis asked.</p><p>\u201cDid you get anywhere with the governor\u2019s office?\u201d Jeb asked Bob.</p><p>Bob shook his head. \u201cI got the runaround. Reading between the lines, I could tell the politicians don\u2019t want to get involved in this fight. Buffalo Valley is on its own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Matt said, \u201cmaybe the politicians don\u2019t want to take sides in this issue, but there are plenty of other influential people who aren\u2019t afraid of challenging Value-X.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>A flurry of names followed\u2014writers and filmmakers and media personalities\u2014along with a volunteer to contact each one immediately after the holidays. This was exactly the kind of pressure necessary to get the company\u2019s attention.</p><p>Soon the men were talking excitedly, their voices blending with those of their children. Various ideas were considered, discarded, put aside for research or further thought. The women were right\u2014they had to become a united front.</p><p>\u201cDo you seriously believe anyone at the corporate level will listen?\u201d Gage asked. \u201cThey\u2019ve dealt with organized opposition before.\u201d</p><p>Matt shrugged, although he suspected that if Margaret was the one doing the talking, those muck-a-mucks would soon learn she refused to be ignored. A smile formed on his face as he imagined Margaret standing before the conglomerate\u2019s board of directors. They\u2019d listen, all right.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d Brandon Wyatt asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Matt shook his head, dispelling the image.</p><p>\u201cJoanie\u2019s been real upset about all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaddy, too,\u201d Jeb said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the grocery will be too badly affected, but that\u2019s not the point. She\u2019s worried about how everyone else will fare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cValue-X would ruin Joanie\u2019s and my business,\u201d Brandon said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think a bunch of suits in some fancy office in Seattle really care what\u2019ll happen to a small video store in Buffalo Valley.\u201d</p><p>The other men agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe could hold a rally,\u201d Gage suggested.</p><p>\u201cThe women have already thought of that,\u201d Leta inserted, speaking from behind the counter. \u201cThey figured it wouldn\u2019t have enough impact unless we got major media coverage.\u201d</p><p>Several of the men nodded; others seemed prepared to argue.</p><p>\u201cHassie\u2019s probably got a few ideas,\u201d Gage said next. \u201cWhen she comes back from the meeting, we\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>Leta broke in. \u201cHassie\u2019s not with the others,\u201d she informed them as she set a chocolate soda on the polished mahogany counter.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not?\u201d The question came from two or three men simultaneously, including Matt.</p><p>\u201cNope. She\u2019s at home this morning.\u201d</p><p>This was news to them all.</p><p>\u201cHassie\u2019s not with the other women?\u201d Dennis repeated, frowning. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many of them are over at Sarah\u2019s, anyway?\u201d Matt wanted to know.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not at Sarah\u2019s,\u201d Dennis told them.</p><p>\u201cThen where are they?\u201d Matt had assumed that was where the women had met. Sarah had the most space for such a gathering.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019re over at the church with Joyce Dawson,\u201d Brandon Wyatt said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure, but something Joanie said...\u201d</p><p>Matt figured it wasn\u2019t all that important where the women had congregated. The community was coming together, bringing forth ideas. Value-X might be a powerful corporation, but the men and women of Buffalo Valley weren\u2019t going to submit humbly to this invasion.</p><p>Sleep had eluded Vaughn Kyle all night. The message of the Christmas play had stayed with him. A community standing together, enduring through hard times, its unique character created by that history of struggle and victory. Not a community, this community. Buffalo Valley.</p><p>His confession to Carrie after the performance had played no small part in his inability to sleep. Unfortunately Carrie wasn\u2019t the only woman he needed to talk to, and the conversation with Natalie would probably be even harder.</p><p>He waited until eight, Seattle time, before calling her. His decision to resign and the reasons for it would infuriate her. And his plan to end their relationship\u2014he didn\u2019t even want to think about her reaction to that. He wasn\u2019t convinced that she truly loved him, but the humiliation of being rejected would be difficult for her to accept. He sighed; he\u2019d betrayed Carrie twice over and now he was doing the same to Natalie.</p><p>The house was still quiet when Vaughn brought the portable phone into his room. Sitting on the bed, he dialed Natalie\u2019s home number and waited four long rings before she picked up.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d Her voice was groggy with sleep. Normally she\u2019d be awake by now. He\u2019d already started off on the wrong foot, and he had yet to say a word.</p><p>\u201cI got you up, didn\u2019t I,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cVaughn,\u201d she said sleepily, then yawned. \u201cHello, darling.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn tried to ignore the guilt that rushed forward. Mere hours ago, he\u2019d been holding and kissing Carrie.</p><p>\u201cThis is a surprise,\u201d Natalie cooed. \u201cYou must really be missing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to talk to you about Value-X,\u201d Vaughn said, getting directly to the point. There was no easy way to do this.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d she protested. \u201cYou\u2019re always telling me all I think about is work. I didn\u2019t get home until after eleven last night, and work is the last thing I want to think about now. You know we\u2019re under a lot of pressure just before the holidays. There\u2019s so much I have to get done, especially since I\u2019ll be leaving on this trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know, and I apologize.\u201d He honestly felt bad about this. \u201cI\u2019ll be sending in a fax this morning.\u201d</p><p>She sighed as if to say she was already bored. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, bracing himself for her angry outburst. \u201cI\u2019ve resigned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her shriek was loud enough to actually startle him. \u201cIf this is a joke, Vaughn, I am not amused.\u201d</p><p>In some ways he wished it was. He doubted this was one of those situations he\u2019d look back on years from now and find amusing. \u201cYou asked me to check out Buffalo Valley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou mentioned an aunt or someone you knew who lived there. What\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe big deal is that the town isn\u2019t interested in Value-X setting up shop.\u201d</p><p>Natalie didn\u2019t so much as pause. \u201cHoney, listen, we\u2019ve already been through this. Few communities fully appreciate everything we can do for them. Invariably there\u2019s a handful of discontented, ill-informed people who take it upon themselves to make a fuss. For the most part it\u2019s a token protest. Rarely is it ever a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, why did you ask me to report back to you on Buffalo Valley?\u201d She\u2019d been worried, Vaughn knew; otherwise she\u2019d never have suggested he check the place out.</p><p>\u201cAfter the bad publicity in that Montana town, I overreacted. That was a mistake,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI see that now. A big mistake! I can\u2019t allow you to throw away the opportunity of a lifetime because I sent you into battle unprepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBattle?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d she said irritably. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. You were going to be in the area and it seemed like such a little thing. I should\u2019ve known...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful you asked me to do this,\u201d Vaughn countered. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a whole lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! No...this is all wrong.\u201d Natalie sounded desperate now.</p><p>\u201cBuffalo Valley is a nice town. The people here are worried about what\u2019ll happen if Value-X moves in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut they don\u2019t understand that we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want someone to listen, and it\u2019s clear the company isn\u2019t going to do that.\u201d The purpose of Natalie\u2019s visit was to convince the people of Buffalo Valley that they needed Value-X.</p><p>\u201cOf course the town wants us to listen, they all do, but what would happen to our jobs if we actually did?\u201d</p><p>Natalie made her point without contradiction by Vaughn, although he doubted she recognized the real import of her words.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid,\u201d Natalie pleaded. \u201cAt least wait until I get there and we can talk this out.\u201d</p> <p>Her arrival was an entirely separate issue. \u201cThat brings up another...problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d she snapped. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to tell me you\u2019ve met someone else and you want to dump me.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn rubbed his hand along his thigh and said nothing.</p><p>\u201cThis has got to be a joke.\u201d She gave a short, humorless laugh. \u201cTalk about the Grinch stealing Christmas!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize my timing is bad\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad! You don\u2019t know the half of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNatalie, listen, I\u2019m genuinely sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked me to be your wife.\u201d</p><p>Technically, that wasn\u2019t true. They\u2019d talked about marriage, but Natalie had shown no great enthusiasm. Now, however, didn\u2019t seem to be the time to argue the point. \u201cIf you\u2019ll recall, you were pretty lukewarm about the idea. That has to tell you something about your feelings for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was playing it cool,\u201d she insisted, sounding close to tears.</p><p>Vaughn had never known Natalie to cry, and he experienced deep pangs of regret. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt you, but I had to say something before you showed up here.\u201d He hoped she\u2019d cancel the trip, although he figured that was unlikely.</p><p>\u201cI wanted you to be thrilled when I finally agreed to marry you. Now you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly...\u201d He did hold tender feelings for her, but he knew with certainty that they were never meant to be together.</p><p>\u201cYou love me\u2014but you love someone else more?\u201d</p> <p>Vaughn wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. He hadn\u2019t declared his feelings for Carrie, but the promise he felt with her outweighed his feelings for Natalie.</p><p>\u201cI suppose she\u2019s one of the crusaders against Value-X That would make sense, now that I think about it.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving up on us,\u201d Natalie insisted, \u201cnot until we\u2019ve had a chance to speak face-to-face.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d already guessed she wouldn\u2019t make this easy. \u201cI\u2019d rather you just accepted my decision.\u201d</p><p>A painful pause followed. \u201cJust what do you plan to do with your life if you resign from Value-X?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d His future was as much a mystery to him as it was to her. All Vaughn could say was that he had no intention of remaining with the company.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking clearly,\u201d Natalie said.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m thinking about settling here.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure where the words had come from, but until he said them aloud the possibility hadn\u2019t even occurred to him.</p><p>\u201cIn North Dakota,\u201d she blurted out, as though he was suffering from temporary insanity. \u201cNow I know this is all a bad joke. Who in their right mind would live there? You know the demographics as well as I do. No one lives in a place like that on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous! I wouldn\u2019t believe it if I wasn\u2019t hearing it with my own ears. You can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>Although he knew it was probably a waste of breath, Vaughn felt obliged to tell her about Buffalo Valley. He wanted her to know the people he\u2019d met. She couldn\u2019t begin to grasp what he felt unless she understood who and what they were.</p><p>\u201cThis farming community is small-town America at its best,\u201d he said, and wondered if she was even listening. \u201cThey have a history of banding together in hard times\u2014and there\u2019ve been plenty of hard times.\u201d He wanted to make her understand the depth of his respect for them, so he relayed to her the plot of the Christmas play.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all very interesting,\u201d Natalie told him, her tone bored, \u201cbut that was then and this is now. Value-X will come into Buffalo Valley with or without you. With or without me. It doesn\u2019t matter how many times you sit and watch a group of teenagers act out the town\u2019s history, nothing is going to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will,\u201d Vaughn said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not letting you quit. One day you\u2019ll thank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst I\u2019m going into corporate headquarters to make sure no one reads your resignation letter. Then I\u2019m flying out on the twenty-seventh, just the way I planned, so we can talk this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t. Let it go, Natalie.\u201d</p><p>Her returning laugh sounded like a threat. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. You didn\u2019t really believe I\u2019d allow you to cut me loose with a simple phone call, did you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to respond. What was the point?</p><p>\u201cYou see yourself as this hero, this knight in shining armor, and while that\u2019s fine and good, it isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn could see the storm clouds gathering on the horizon.</p><p>Sunday morning while his parents attended church, Vaughn drove into Buffalo Valley. He\u2019d made the trek so often in the past week that it seemed almost second nature to head in that direction.</p><p>Everything about the town appealed to him. It\u2019d started when he\u2019d first met Hassie and accepted the gold watch that had belonged to her husband. With the watch came an implied trust. He refused to be part of anything that would betray their relationship.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t heard from Carrie, but he would once she was ready. He didn\u2019t think it would take her long to come to terms with his confession. Because of her ex-husband\u2019s betrayal, it was vital that he be as open and honest with her as possible. However...he still hadn\u2019t explained Natalie\u2019s role in his life. Poor Carrie was about to be hit with a second shock, but there wasn\u2019t a damn thing he could do to prevent it.</p><p>He parked just outside town, at the twenty-acre site for the proposed Value-X. With the wind howling, he climbed out of the car and walked onto the property. Either he was becoming accustomed to the bone-chilling weather or it\u2019d warmed up in the past twenty-four hours. He discovered he could breathe now without feeling as though he was inhaling ice particles.</p><p>He\u2019d been there for several minutes when he saw a truck pull up and park next to his vehicle. Two men climbed out and started toward him. He instantly recognized them as Carrie\u2019s younger brothers.</p><p>\u201cChuck and Ken, right?\u201d he said as they approached.</p><p>Chuck, the older of the two, touched his hat. \u201cVaughn Kyle?\u201d</p><p>Vaughn nodded.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a falling-out with Carrie after the play?\u201d Chuck asked. The man was nothing if not direct. His brow had furrowed and the teasing friendliness was gone. \u201cYou hurt her and you have me to answer to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of hurting her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He nodded once as if to suggest the subject was closed.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here?\u201d Ken muttered.</p><p>Vaughn wasn\u2019t sure what to tell him. He hadn\u2019t asked Carrie to keep the fact that he was employed by Value-X a secret, but it was apparent that she had. If either Chuck or Ken knew the truth, they\u2019d have him tarred and feathered and run out of town.</p><p>\u201cJust looking,\u201d Vaughn told him.</p><p>\u201cLooking at what? Empty land?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had this twenty acres or any portion of it, how would you develop it?\u201d Vaughn asked the pair.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy,\u201d Ken said. \u201cThis town needs a feed store\u2014been needing one for years. Most everyone has to drive to Devils Lake for their feed.\u201d</p><p>A feed store. Now that was interesting. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do it?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo time. The hardware store keeps us busy. Dad needs us there, but if someone were to come along with enough investment capital and a head for business, they\u2019d be guaranteed success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad carries some of the more common feed, but he doesn\u2019t have room for much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got to talking about a feed store just the other day,\u201d Ken said, glancing at his brother. \u201cWondering who might be able to open one.\u201d</p><p>This morning, Vaughn had casually told Natalie that he might settle in Buffalo Valley. A few days earlier his future was set, and now all at once he was cast adrift. His carefully ordered life was in shambles, and Vaughn didn\u2019t like the uncomfortable feeling that gave him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d take someone with ready cash,\u201d Ken told him, his expression pensive, \u201cand that\u2019s in short supply around here.\u201d He kicked at the snow with the toe of his boot. \u201cPeople in these parts invest everything in their land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou interested?\u201d Chuck asked him bluntly.</p><p>Vaughn looked in the direction of town, suddenly aware that this venture piqued his interest. He wanted to be part of Buffalo Valley, part of its future. It\u2019d be a risk, but he\u2019d never backed down from a challenge before and he wasn\u2019t planning to start now.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know a damn thing about running a feed store,\u201d he said, meeting the other men\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Chuck and Ken studied him for a long moment.</p><p>\u201cYou serious about this?\u201d Chuck finally asked.</p><p>Vaughn nodded.</p><p>\u201cBetween Dad, me and my brothers, we could show you everything you need to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d Vaughn found it hard to believe that these men, who were little more than strangers, would willingly offer him their expertise.</p><p>\u201cI saw a light in my sister\u2019s eyes that hasn\u2019t been there since her divorce,\u201d Ken told him. \u201cThat made me decide you might be worth taking a chance on.\u201d He stared down at the ground, then raised his head. \u201cNow, I realize you moving into town and opening a feed store might have absolutely nothing to do with Carrie. Personally, I hope it does, but I want you to know that whatever happens between you and my sister is your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way it would have to be.\u201d</p><p>Her two brothers shared a glance and seemed to reach the same conclusion. \u201cYou\u2019re right about that.\u201d Chuck spoke for the pair. \u201cThis has nothing to do with Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a lot of ifs in all this,\u201d Vaughn reminded them. He could see that they were getting excited, but then so was he. Naturally, all of this depended on a dozen different factors. Right now it was little more than the glimmer of an idea. Little more than a possibility. But it gave him a glimpse of what he might do.... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAt the moment the future doesn\u2019t look all that promising for Buffalo Valley,\u201d Ken said, surveying the bare land around them. It went without saying that if Value-X came to town, that would be the end of any talk about a feed store.</p><p>On the verge of leaving, Vaughn returned to the subject of their sister. \u201cHave either of you seen Carrie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone for the day,\u201d Ken told him.</p><p>\u201cAll day?\u201d</p> <p>Chuck shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s over with our brother Tom and his family. Did you two have plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d How could he expect her to be at his beck and call? \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her later,\u201d he said with reluctance. Their conversation had to take place soon. He\u2019d rather this business with Natalie was over, but it now seemed that would require a protracted...discussion, for lack of a better word.</p><p>\u201cShe was upset when you dropped her off at the house after the play.\u201d Ken frowned at him in an accusatory way, suggesting Vaughn had some explaining to do. \u201cWhat happened? What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Carrie\u2019s and my business. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Chuck agreed. \u201cShe\u2019d have our heads if she knew we were talking to you about her. We\u2019ll stay out of it, but like I said, you hurt her and you\u2019ll have me to answer to.\u201d</p> <p>Vaughn nodded and resisted the urge to laugh. Melodramatic though they sounded, her brothers were serious.</p><p>\u201cI heard you and your parents are spending Christmas Day with Hassie,\u201d Ken said.</p><p>News sure traveled fast in a small town. \u201cWe\u2019re coming for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I think we might be able to arrange something.\u201d The two brothers exchanged another look.</p><p>\u201cArrange what?\u201d Vaughn asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing much, just an opportunity for you to have some time alone with our sister.\u201d Chuck and Ken left then, both of them grinning broadly.</p> <p>Chapter 9</p><p>Hassie spent Christmas morning with Buffalo Bob, Merrily and little Bobby, upstairs at the 3 of a Kind. Sitting around the Christmas tree with the family reminded her of what it\u2019d been like years ago, when Valerie and Vaughn were young. The good feelings started right then, and she suspected this would be her best Christmas in a very long while.</p><p>Bobby\u2019s eyes got round as quarters when his father rolled out a shiny new miniature bicycle with training wheels. It amazed her that a three-year-old could actually ride a bicycle. In another three or four months, the park would be crowded with kids on bikes, enjoying the Dakota sunshine. When Hassie closed her eyes, she could almost hear the sound of their laughter. That would happen, she comforted herself, with or without Value-X.</p><p>She exchanged gifts with the family\u2014magazine subscriptions for Bob and Merrily, a book of nursery rhymes for Bobby. Their gift to her was a new pair of lined leather gloves. After coffee and croissants\u2014and hugs and kisses\u2014she left.</p><p>Home again, Hassie set the dining-room table with her finest china. Not much reason to use it these days. Yet twice this week she\u2019d had cause to bring it out of the old mahogany cabinet. The first time was her visit with Barbara and now Christmas dinner.</p><p>Already the kitchen counter was crowded with a variety of food. Carrie and her mother had thoughtfully dropped off a platter of decorated sugar cookies. Those cookies, plus the ones she\u2019d collected the night of the exchange, added up to enough for the entire town.</p><p>Sarah Urlacher and Calla had given her a plate of homemade fudge. Maddy, Lindsay and several of the other women had stopped by with offerings, too\u2014preserves and homemade bread and mincemeat tarts. It was far more than Hassie could eat in two or three Christmases.</p><p>Then word had leaked out about Vaughn Kyle and his parents coming for dinner. Before Hassie could stop them, her friends and neighbors had dropped off a plethora of side dishes. Joanie Wyatt sent over baked yams. Rachel Quantrill delivered a green-bean-and-cauliflower casserole. Soon all that was required of Hassie was the bird and dressing. The tantalizing aroma of baking turkey, sage and onions drifted through the house.</p> <p>Living alone, Hassie didn\u2019t bother much with meals. At night, after she closed the pharmacy, her dinner consisted of whatever was quick and easy. When Jerry had been alive and the children still lived at home, she\u2019d been an accomplished cook. Now she considered cooking for one a nuisance. Many a night she dined on soup or a microwave entr\u00e9e.</p><p>The doorbell chimed at exactly one o\u2019clock, and Hassie, who\u2019d been occupying herself with last-minute touches, was ready to receive her company.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Barbara Kyle sang out, hugging Hassie as soon as she opened the front door.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas. Merry Christmas.\u201d Hassie hugged them all.</p><p>For the next few minutes the men made trips back and forth between the car and the house. They hauled in festively wrapped presents, plus various contributions to the meal, including three beautiful pies.</p><p>\u201cHow in heaven\u2019s name are the four of us going to eat all these pies?\u201d Hassie asked, giggling like a schoolgirl over such an embarrassment of riches. Pies, cookies, candies. Oh, my, she\u2019d be on a diet till next June if she tasted everything in her kitchen.</p><p>\u201cPecan pie is Rick\u2019s favorite,\u201d Barbara explained.</p><p>\u201cPumpkin is mine,\u201d Vaughn said.</p><p>\u201cAnd fresh apple mixed with cranberry is mine,\u201d Barbara said, setting down the third pie. She had to rearrange other dishes on the crowded counter to find room for it.</p><p>\u201cApple mixed with cranberry,\u201d Hassie mused aloud. \u201cThat sounds delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to share,\u201d Barbara said with a laugh.</p><p>The meal was even better than Hassie had dared hope. The turkey was moist and succulent, and the sage dressing was her finest ever, if she did say so herself. The four of them sat around the table and passed the serving dishes to one another. They talked and laughed as if each was part of Hassie\u2019s family. Anyone seeing them would never have guessed there\u2019d been a thirty-three-year lapse in their relationship.</p><p>This was the way Christmas was meant to be, Hassie thought, immersing herself in the good feelings. Barbara had always been a talker, and she effortlessly kept the conversation going. The years had changed Rick Kyle considerably, Hassie noted, smiling over at him. She doubted she would\u2019ve recognized him now.</p><p>The last time Hassie had seen Rick, he\u2019d had shoulder-length brown hair, a bushy mustache and narrow-rimmed glasses. A wooden peace sign had dangled from his neck. As she recalled, he\u2019d worn the craziest color combinations with tie-dyed bell-bottom jeans and sandals.</p><p>His hair was mostly gone now, but Barbara claimed bald men could be exceedingly sexy. Hassie wouldn\u2019t know about that, but it did her good to see that they were happy and obviously still in love.</p><p>Perhaps it was selfish of her, but she liked to believe that if her son had lived, Vaughn would\u2019ve found the same happiness with Barbara.</p><p>\u201cIf I eat another bite, I swear someone might mistake me for a stuffed sausage,\u201d Barbara declared, pushing back her chair.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Rick wrapped his arms around his belly and groaned.</p><p>Hassie looked at Vaughn, who winked and said, \u201cCould someone pass me the mashed potatoes and gravy?\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Barbara hurled a roll at him from across the table. Vaughn deftly caught it. \u201cHey, I\u2019m a growing boy.\u201d</p><p>When they\u2019d finished, the men cleared off the table and Hassie brewed a pot of coffee. They gathered in the living room around the small Christmas tree, where Hassie had tucked three small gifts, one for each of her guests. Shopping in Buffalo Valley was limited and there hadn\u2019t been much time, so Hassie had found items with special meaning to share with her friends. Three little gifts she knew each would treasure.</p><p>For Barbara, it was a pearl pin Jerry had given her after Vaughn\u2019s birth. For Rick it was a fountain pen\u2014an antique. Choosing a gift for Vaughn had been difficult. In the end she\u2019d parted with one of the medals the army had awarded her son for bravery. Since Vaughn had recently been in the military himself, she felt he\u2019d appreciate what this medal represented.</p><p>They seemed truly touched by her gifts. Barbara\u2019s eyes brimmed with tears and she pinned the pearl to her silk blouse. Rick, who didn\u2019t appear to be the demonstrative sort, hugged her. And Vaughn seemed at a loss for words.</p><p>\u201cI have something to tell you,\u201d Vaughn said after several minutes of silence.</p><p>\u201cThis sounds serious.\u201d Hassie saw the look Barbara and Rick exchanged and wondered at its meaning.</p><p>Vaughn leaned forward and took Hassie\u2019s hands in both his own. \u201cI told Mom and Dad earlier, and they urged me to be honest with you, as well. First, I want you to know I\u2019d never deliberately do anything to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. Honest about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cValue-X. When I left Seattle, I\u2019d accepted a job with them.\u201d</p><p>Hassie gasped, and her hand flew to her mouth. This was almost more than she could take in. Vaughn an employee of Value-X?</p><p>\u201cI knew the company was planning to expand into Buffalo Valley, but I didn\u2019t understand the threat they represented to the community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t working for them any longer,\u201d Barbara quickly inserted.</p><p>\u201cSince I wasn\u2019t going to be officially an employee until after the first of the year, one of the vice presidents suggested I not mention my association with the company,\u201d Vaughn explained. \u201cIt was never my intention to deceive you or anyone in Buffalo Valley.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cI faxed in my resignation and made it effective immediately.\u201d</p><p>Hassie felt a little dizzy. It was hard enough to grasp what he was saying, and she could only imagine what Carrie must think, so she asked, \u201cDoes Carrie know?\u201d</p><p>Vaughn nodded. \u201cI told her the night of the play. I didn\u2019t want to wait until after the holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d Hassie asked. She feared that the news might mean the end for this budding relationship, which would be a dreadful shame.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to speak to her since.\u201d</p><p>Barbara moved forward to the edge of the sofa. \u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn cast his mother a look that suggested he\u2019d rather she hadn\u2019t said anything.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d As far as Hassie was concerned, it was too late for secrets now.</p><p>Vaughn glanced at his mother again. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get anyone\u2019s hopes up, because it\u2019s much too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, we know that,\u201d Barbara interjected, then waited for him to continue.</p><p>Vaughn\u2019s reluctance was evident. At last he said, \u201cI\u2019m investigating the possibility of opening a feed store here in town.\u201d</p><p>For the second time in as many moments, Hassie gasped. Only this time, the shock was one of excitement and pleasure. \u201cOh, Vaughn, that\u2019s an excellent idea. The town could use a feed store.\u201d</p><p>Rick wrapped his arm around his wife\u2019s shoulders, and both of them smiled broadly. \u201cVaughn spoke with two of the Hendrickson brothers about it yesterday morning,\u201d Barbara said. \u201cThey actually suggested it.\u201d</p><p>Hassie\u2019s heart surged with hope. Vaughn was right of course; there was no reason to get carried away. But she couldn\u2019t help it. The thought of having Vaughn right here in Buffalo Valley\u2014she was almost afraid to believe it could happen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got an appointment with Heath Quantrill first thing Wednesday morning,\u201d Vaughn explained. \u201cI\u2019ll need to put together a business plan and look into financing. The Hendricksons recommended I start there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014Heath will give you good advice.\u201d Some of the excitement left her as reality came rushing back. \u201cEverything hinges on what happens with Value-X, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Vaughn gave her a lopsided smile. \u201cBut I have a good feeling about this.\u201d As Hassie fought the emotion that threatened to overwhelm her, he added, \u201cI want to invest in Buffalo Valley.\u201d</p><p>Keeping the tears at bay was impossible now. \u201cWhy would you do such a thing?\u201d she asked between sniffles. Reaching into her pocket, she withdrew a linen handkerchief and blew her nose. She must be getting old, because normally she wasn\u2019t a woman prone to tears.</p> <p>\u201cI arrived in North Dakota thinking I knew exactly what I wanted and where I was headed,\u201d Vaughn said, \u201cbut everything changed. I probably shouldn\u2019t have said anything about my idea.\u201d He frowned at his mother. \u201cBut now that it\u2019s out, I\u2019m glad you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod bless you,\u201d Hassie whispered, stretching her arms toward Vaughn for a hug. Their embrace was warm. \u201cIf God had seen fit to give me a grandson, I would have wanted him to be just like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a high compliment,\u201d Vaughn said, sitting down again.</p><p>\u201cI meant it to be,\u201d Hassie told him. She rubbed her wet cheek with the back of her hand. \u201cLook what you did,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just anyone who can make this old lady weep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShame on you, son,\u201d Rick teased, and they all smiled.</p> <p>It took Hassie a few moments to compose herself.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Barbara said, pointing outside, \u201cit\u2019s snowing.\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, the flakes were falling thick and soft, creating a perfect Christmas scene. \u201cThis is the way I always dreamed Christmas would be,\u201d Hassie whispered. \u201cSurrounded by family\u2014\u201d she used the word purposely \u201c\u2014on a beautiful winter day.\u201d</p><p>This was the best Christmas she\u2019d had in many years, and all because of the Kyles\u2014people who\u2019d been brought into Hassie\u2019s life by her son. Somehow she could picture Vaughn smiling down, wishing them a Merry Christmas.</p><p>Hassie had invited Carrie to join Vaughn and his parents for dessert on Christmas Day, and Carrie had yet to decide if she\u2019d go. Vaughn\u2019s confession about working for Value-X had shocked her. The fact that he\u2019d come into town, gained her confidence and that of everyone else\u2014so he could collect information for the company\u2014had been a betrayal of trust and goodwill. He\u2019d withheld the truth from her and she should be outraged. She was outraged.</p><p>All week Vaughn had listened to everyone\u2019s objections to Value-X and said nothing. As she thought back on their numerous conversations, she realized how often he\u2019d defended the company. At the time she\u2019d assumed he was playing devil\u2019s advocate. Now she knew otherwise. Carrie wasn\u2019t sure what had happened to make him resign. Whatever it was, she was grateful. Still...</p> <p>Trust was a basic issue with Carrie. Vaughn had betrayed her, Hassie and the entire town, and she couldn\u2019t conveniently look the other way. Forgive and forget might work for others, but not for her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think Vaughn had told anyone else. Carrie hadn\u2019t determined whether that was a good thing or not. She did know she had to hide this from Hassie, who would be heartbroken if she found out. If she didn\u2019t show up at Hassie\u2019s and then claimed she\u2019d forgotten, Hassie would immediately conclude that something was wrong. Then she\u2019d start asking questions. Questions Carrie didn\u2019t want to answer. She could invent plausible excuses, but the problem was that Carrie did want to see Vaughn again, despite what he\u2019d told her.</p><p>She needed to talk to him, needed to vent her feelings. The shock of his confession had robbed her of that chance. But finding a private time to speak with him today might prove difficult, if not impossible. In any event, she hadn\u2019t given verbal shape to her emotions yet. Talking to him should probably wait, she rationalized.</p><p>\u201cWhere you going?\u201d Ken asked, following her into the hallway as she gathered her coat, gloves and scarf.</p><p>\u201cI bet she\u2019s going off to see that new friend of hers,\u201d Chuck teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going over to Hassie\u2019s,\u201d she informed her two younger brothers smugly.</p><p>\u201cI suppose he\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>How Pete knew that, Carrie could only guess. She shoved her arms into the silk-lined sleeves of her coat.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s there, all right,\u201d Tom said, leaning against the door jamb. \u201cHis car\u2019s parked outside Hassie\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Carrie ignored him and went to get her purse. She and Hassie had exchanged their gifts on Christmas Eve, but Carrie had borrowed a book on traditional remedies that she needed to return. She retrieved it from the bookcase.</p><p>\u201cWill you guys leave me alone?\u201d she cried. All four of her brothers were trailing her from room to room. \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything better to do?\u201d</p><p>Her brothers glanced at each other and shrugged, then Pete announced, \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to hear what we think of your new boyfriend?\u201d Ken asked.</p><p>If they could be this obstinate, so could she. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Carrie headed for the front door. If her four guardian angels wanted to follow her into the cold and snow, that was their choice.</p><p>\u201cI like him, Carrie,\u201d Ken called after her.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Tom crowded beside him in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right,\u201d Pete concurred.</p><p>Chuck simply winked and gave her a thumbs-up. This had to be a record. Never before had she dated a man all four of her brothers approved of. Little did they know. She wondered what they\u2019d say if they knew that, until recently, he\u2019d been a Value-X employee. The answer didn\u2019t bear considering. She couldn\u2019t disillusion them any more than she could Hassie. Against her will, she\u2019d been pulled into his subterfuge, and she hated it.</p><p>The snow was falling hard by the time Carrie reached Hassie\u2019s house; she barely noticed.</p><p>Vaughn answered the door and surprised her by closing it after him as he stepped onto the porch. \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d he said, his eyes never leaving hers.</p><p>As much as possible, she avoided looking at him.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk, Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere? Now?\u201d She faked a short laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Vaughn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, then?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>He sighed with unmistakable relief. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to feel anything. She longed to ignore him, make a token visit and then be on her way. But it was too late for that. Her emotions were painfully confused; she wanted to kiss him and at the same time, she wanted to scream and rage and throw his betrayal in his face.</p><p>He pressed his hand to her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d intended to slap his hand away, but instead, her fingers curled around his, and she closed her eyes and leaned toward him. Then she was angry with herself for being weak and jerked back.</p><p>\u201cCome in out of the cold,\u201d Hassie called just as Vaughn opened the door and Carrie stepped inside. She took off her coat and tossed it onto the stair railing.</p><p>\u201cHave you met my dad?\u201d Vaughn asked, taking Carrie by the elbow and escorting her into the living room. He made the introductions.</p><p>\u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d she said, hoping none of the stiffness she felt came through in her voice.</p><p>Hassie was on her way to the kitchen. \u201cYou\u2019re just in time for pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help dish up,\u201d Barbara said, following Hassie.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Carrie offered, eager to escape Vaughn.</p><p>Barbara Kyle shook her head. \u201cWell take care of it.\u201d</p><p>The two older women disappeared, which meant that Carrie was left alone with Vaughn and his father. She would\u2019ve preferred the women\u2019s company and felt awkward alone with the two men. Vaughn was obviously eager to talk to her, and she was just as eager to avoid any conversation with him. Yes, there were things she needed to say; she wasn\u2019t ready, though\u2014not nearly ready. She glanced in his direction and he mouthed something, but she looked away.</p><p>\u201cHassie and Barb are trying to keep you and Vaughn together,\u201d Rick confided to her frankly. Vaughn scowled fiercely. \u201cSo you may as well play along,\u201d he advised. \u201cHere, sit down, Carrie, and make yourself comfortable.\u201d</p><p>She sat on the sofa and Vaughn joined her, sitting so close that their thighs brushed. In an effort to ignore him, she stared out the picture window.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a lovely day?\u201d she asked, making conversation with his father. \u201cThe snow\u2014\u201d A flash of color outside caught her attention. It was her younger brothers. Gasping, she leaped to her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Vaughn asked, getting up, too.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Chuck and Ken,\u201d she said, and pointed at the window. Sure enough, they were outside\u2014in an old-fashioned sleigh pulled by two draft horses.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my great-great-grandfather\u2019s sleigh,\u201d Carrie explained. \u201cHe used it to deliver the mail. Dad and Mr. McKenna have been fixing it up. It\u2019s been in the barn for the last hundred years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sleigh looks like something straight out of a Christmas movie,\u201d Vaughn\u2019s father remarked, standing by the window. \u201cWhose horses are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they belong to a friend of Pete\u2019s,\u201d Carrie said.</p><p>Despite her mood, she giggled. Her brothers must have planned this all along. How they\u2019d managed to keep it a secret she could only guess.</p><p>The doorbell chimed, and when Hassie answered it, she found Chuck grinning down at her.</p><p>\u201cAnyone here interested in a sleigh ride?\u201d he asked, looking around Hassie to where Carrie and Vaughn stood. \u201cThere\u2019s room for five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game,\u201d Rick said. \u201cCome on, Barb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHassie?\u201d Vaughn turned to their hostess.</p><p>She seemed about to refuse, then smiled broadly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t mind if I do.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn helped Hassie on with her coat and made sure her boots were tightly laced before they ventured outside. Carrie tried not to be affected by the tenderness he displayed toward Hassie, especially when he bent down on one knee to lace her boots. There was nothing condescending in his action, only affection and concern. Meanwhile, Rick held Carrie\u2019s coat for her and then Barbara\u2019s. By the time they left the house, the old sleigh, pulled by twin chestnut geldings, had attracted quite a bit of attention from the neighborhood. The horses were festively decked out in harnesses decorated with jangling bells.</p><p>Barbara, Rick and Hassie sat in the back seat, which fortunately was nicely padded. Once they were settled, Ken handed them a blanket to place over their laps. Carrie and Vaughn took the front seat, which was narrower and made of wood, forcing them close together.</p><p>Chuck and Ken walked in front of the horses, leading them down the unfamiliar street. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere are you taking us?\u201d Carrie shouted as her brothers climbed onto the sleigh.</p><p>\u201cThe park,\u201d Ken called back.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be singing Christmas songs?\u201d Barbara asked.</p><p>\u201cGo right ahead,\u201d Rick answered, and taking him at his word, Vaughn\u2019s mother started with \u201cJingle Bells.\u201d What could be more fitting? Even if it was a \u201ctwo-horse open sleigh.\u201d</p> <p>Moments later Hassie\u2019s rough voice joined Barbara\u2019s soft soprano.</p><p>Carrie began to sing, too, and soon Vaughn\u2019s rich baritone blended with the women\u2019s voices. He and Carrie looked at each other. Perhaps it was the magic of the season or the fact that they were in a sleigh singing while they dashed through the snow, their song accompanied by the muffled clopping of hooves and the jingling of harness bells. Whatever the reason, Carrie realized her anger had completely dissipated. Vaughn seemed to genuinely regret what he\u2019d done. He wasn\u2019t involved in a plot to destroy Buffalo Valley. To his credit, as soon as he\u2019d recognized the threat Value-X represented to the town, he\u2019d resigned from the company. It couldn\u2019t have been easy to walk away from a high-paying job like that.</p><p>Vaughn noticed the transformation in her immediately. He stopped singing and leaned close enough to ask, \u201cAm I forgiven?\u201d</p><p>Carrie nodded.</p><p>His eyes brightened and he slid an arm around her shoulders. Carrie was convinced that if their circumstances had been different, he would\u2019ve kissed her.</p> <p>When they reached the middle of the park, they found Carrie\u2019s entire family waiting there, applauding their arrival.</p><p>Effortlessly they segued from one Christmas carol to another. Everyone seemed to have a favorite. Amid the singing and the laughter, Carrie\u2019s mother served hot chocolate from large thermoses.</p><p>Vaughn and Carrie left their places in order to give others an opportunity to try out the sleigh. After several trips around the park, Chuck and Ken drove Hassie and Vaughn\u2019s parents back to Hassie\u2019s. Carrie and Vaughn remained with her family.</p><p>With pride, Carrie took Vaughn around and introduced him to everyone he had yet to meet.</p><p>\u201cWhat were Chuck and Ken talking about earlier?\u201d Tom asked, standing next to his wife, Becky.</p><p>Vaughn glanced at Carrie. \u201cWe discussed a few ideas, nothing more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I understood,\u201d Tom said. \u201cChuck said you\u2019d made an appointment to talk to Heath Quantrill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got an appointment to see Heath?\u201d Carrie asked. \u201cAbout what?\u201d She\u2019d suspected earlier that something was up involving her two younger brothers. Sunday night they\u2019d sat with their father at the kitchen table, talking excitedly in low voices. Carrie couldn\u2019t figure out what they were doing, and when she asked, their replies had been vague.</p><p>Rather than answer her directly, Vaughn looked away.</p><p>\u201cMore secrets?\u201d she asked him under her breath.</p><p>\u201cVaughn\u2019s thinking about opening up a feed store in town,\u201d Tom supplied.</p><p>\u201cIs this true?\u201d she asked. If so, it was the best kind of secret.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s certain yet,\u201d he told her, and she could see that he wasn\u2019t pleased with her older brother for sharing the news. \u201cEverything\u2019s just in the planning stages. The early planning stages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d actually consider moving to Buffalo Valley?\u201d</p> <p>Vaughn nodded and smiled down on her, but then his gaze clouded. \u201cI still need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivately,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>The park was crowded with her family. Carrie knew that the instant they broke away, one of her brothers or nieces and nephews would seek her out. \u201cWe can try,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was in her eyes, but Carrie didn\u2019t care if he saw that or not. \u201cI\u2019m so excited you might move here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m excited, too.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t sound it. If anything, he seemed anxious. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked. She wanted to hear what he needed to say, and she wanted to hear it now, even if they couldn\u2019t escape her family.</p><p>\u201cSomeone from Value-X is coming to Buffalo Valley,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou mean the representative Lindsay mentioned?\u201d Carrie was well aware that the company intended to wage a public-relations campaign to win over the community; that was part of their strategy. She suspected the corporate heads at Value-X had only the slightest idea how unwelcome the retailer was in Buffalo Valley. Whatever they were planning simply wouldn\u2019t work.</p><p>\u201cYes. Her name\u2019s Natalie Nichols and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cYes, it does,\u201d he countered.</p><p>Carrie lowered her voice, wanting him to know he could trust her. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone\u2014no one knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHassie does. I told her myself.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand what had prompted that confession, but wasn\u2019t sure it had been the wisest thing.</p><p>\u201cShe deserves honesty, the same way you do.\u201d Vaughn\u2019s brow creased with concern. \u201cI would\u2019ve come to meet her, with or without Value-X.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t going to be pretty, Carrie, when Natalie Nichols arrives. Value-X has proved that it\u2019s capable of bulldozing its way into a town. They\u2019ve done it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here, not in Buffalo Valley. We won\u2019t let it happen.\u201d When he shook his head, she whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be all right, Vaughn.\u201d Because her fears about him had been laid to rest, she leaned forward and kissed him.</p><p>Vaughn wrapped his arms around her and held her close.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s this?\u201d Pete shouted.</p><p>Carrie laughed. \u201cLeave us be,\u201d she replied. \u201cGo on! Shoo!\u201d She wasn\u2019t about to let her brothers ruin the most romantic moment of her life.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Tom hollered.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d Vaughn said, ignoring her brothers.</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling it\u2019s going to have to wait,\u201d she said, and ducked just in time to miss a flying snowball. Vaughn, however, wasn\u2019t quick enough. Snow exploded across his shoulder and he whirled around to face four large Hendrickson males.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that,\u201d he said mildly.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna make me sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Vaughn\u2019s chuckle was full of threat. \u201cPrepare to die, Hendrickson.\u201d</p><p>Three hours later a cold and exhausted Vaughn made his way back to Hassie\u2019s. The snowball fight had eventually involved everyone in Carrie\u2019s large family, from two-year-old Eli to his grandfather. They\u2019d stopped only long enough to build snow forts before the battle had resumed with peals of laughter and more hilarity than Vaughn could remember in years.</p><p>He\u2019d sincerely meant to tell Carrie about his relationship with Natalie, but the opportunity never arose again. It became easy to let it ride once they were caught up in the family fun. Come morning, he was driving back to town to meet with Heath; he\u2019d stop by the pharmacy and tell her then.</p><p>It was dark when he returned to Hassie\u2019s, and his parents were ready to head home to Grand Forks. When they got there, he discovered that Natalie had left five messages on his parents\u2019 machine. He was stunned to learn that she\u2019d already arived in North Dakota.</p><p>The first message, from the Seattle airport, had been soft and coaxing, claiming she needed to speak to him at his earliest convenience. By the final one, her tone had become hard and demanding. The last part of the message, telling him she\u2019d call early the next morning, had sounded more than a little annoyed.</p><p>\u201cTrouble?\u201d his father asked, standing next to the phone as the message finished playing.</p><p>Vaughn shook his head. \u201cNothing I can\u2019t handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has been the most wonderful Christmas,\u201d his mother said as she turned off the lights. They all went to bed, wishing each other good-night and a final Merry Christmas.</p><p>The following morning Vaughn woke early. He showered, shaved and dressed for his meeting with Heath. Sooner or later, he\u2019d have to talk to Natalie, but he wanted as much information as he could gather before the inevitable confrontation. He gulped down a cup of coffee, eager to be on his way, to begin this new phase of his life. His mother hugged him before he left. \u201cWhat do you want me to say if Natalie shows up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to tell her anything,\u201d he advised. He\u2019d deal with her when he had to, but not before. The letter she\u2019d mentioned would be in the community post office soon and with that, the campaign would officially start. Vaughn was prepared to do whatever was necessary to keep the retailer out of Buffalo Valley. He had a stake in the town\u2019s future now.</p><p>He parked near the bank, then hurried inside; to his surprise, Heath\u2019s glass-enclosed office looked empty. \u201cI have an appointment with Mr. Quantrill,\u201d Vaughn told the receptionist.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Mr. Kyle?\u201d</p><p>Vaughn nodded.</p><p>\u201cMr. Quantrill left a message. He had some last-minute business to attend to and said I should reschedule the appointment. He sent his apologies and asked me to tell you that the Kohn property has sold.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he was standing outside that Vaughn understood the significance of the message. The Kohn property was the land Value-X wanted. So the battle lines had been drawn. No wonder Quantrill was out of the office. There was no longer any reason for Vaughn to meet with him; Quantrill and the community had far more important issues to worry about.</p><p>Vaughn walked over to the pharmacy, his steps slow. No doubt Hassie and everyone else in town had heard the news. He knew how discouraged they\u2019d be.</p><p>When he entered the pharmacy, Carrie was behind the prescription counter. As the bells over the door cheerfully announced his arrival, she glanced up, and from her disheartened expression, it was clear she\u2019d heard. Her eyes seemed dull and lifeless. For a long moment she stared at him, almost as though he was a stranger.</p><p>\u201cI guess you know?\u201d he asked, stepping toward her.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said with such sadness it nearly broke his heart.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help, Carrie,\u201d he told her. \u201cWe can beat Value-X if we stand together.\u201d He tried to sound positive, but truth was, he didn\u2019t know if they could.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the news I\u2019m talking about,\u201d she said, moving out from behind the counter. \u201cI wonder if you\u2019ve ever heard the old saying, Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn frowned, not understanding. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mentioned the name Natalie Nichols yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she works for Value-X. She\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met her this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie\u2019s here?\u201d Foolishly he\u2019d assumed she\u2019d spent the night in Grand Forks.</p><p>\u201cShe stayed at the 3 of a Kind last night. She\u2019s been trying to reach you\u2014and here you are, right under her nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what she told you, but\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe told me she was your fianc\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>It was all starting to make sense to Vaughn, a sick kind of sense. Natalie\u2019s declaration certainly explained that \u201cshame me twice\u201d stuff. \u201cShe spoke to your mother this morning,\u201d Carrie went on. \u201cYour mother said if you weren\u2019t over at the bank to check here with Hassie. Only it was me she found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can explain,\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can, but frankly I\u2019m not interested in listening.\u201d With that, she returned to the pharmaceutical counter and resumed her work as if he was no longer there.</p> <p>Vaughn waited uncertainly for a moment, but she didn\u2019t look anywhere except at her task, at the pills she was counting out.</p><p>It was too late for explanations. Too late to regain her trust. Too late for him.</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>Vaughn didn\u2019t think anything could happen to make this day any worse, but he was wrong.</p><p>As soon as he pulled into the driveway at his parents\u2019 home, he saw the unfamiliar car. Even before he\u2019d climbed out of his own vehicle, he knew who\u2019d come to visit.</p> <p>Natalie.</p><p>Sure enough, the instant he walked into the house, his father cast him a sympathetic glance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re back,\u201d his mother said, her voice strained and unnaturally high.</p><p>\u201cHello, Vaughn,\u201d Natalie said from the living room. She held a cup of coffee balanced on her knee. She looked out of place\u2014and decidedly irritated.</p><p>He nodded in her direction.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019ll leave the two of you to talk,\u201d his mother announced, and exited the room with the speed of someone who\u2019s relieved to escape. His father was directly behind her.</p> <p>With a silent groan, Vaughn turned toward Natalie.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my phone messages.\u201d She set aside her coffee, glaring at him. \u201cWhen I couldn\u2019t find you, I drove straight to Buffalo Valley, where I spent the night at some hole-in-the-wall. Merry Christmas, Natalie,\u201d she said bitterly.</p><p>She didn\u2019t appear to expect a comment, so he sat down across from her and waited. When she didn\u2019t immediately continue, he figured he\u2019d better take his stand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finished with Value-X.\u201d Nothing she could say or offer him would influence his decision. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say you\u2019re finished. I\u2019ll be fortunate to have a job myself after this.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn doubted that. Natalie was the type who\u2019d always land on her feet. Yes, she\u2019d recommended Vaughn to the company, but they couldn\u2019t hold that against her.</p><p>\u201cYou intend to go through with this...this craziness, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>No use hedging. \u201cYes, I do. I\u2019ve resigned, and since I hadn\u2019t officially started work yet, I didn\u2019t bother to give any notice.\u201d</p> <p>She sighed and stared down at her coffee. \u201cI wonder if I ever knew you.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn said nothing. He\u2019d let her say what she wanted, denounce him, threaten him, whatever. She had cause; he wasn\u2019t exactly blameless in all this.</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know what this is about?\u201d she challenged. She stood, crossing her arms. \u201cIt all has to do with you and me.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn didn\u2019t know a kind way to tell her there wasn\u2019t any \u201cyou and me.\u201d There\u2019d probably never been a \u201cyou and me.\u201d Not with Natalie. Looking at her, Vaughn wondered how he could ever have believed he was in love with her. The very traits that had once attracted him now repulsed him. Her ambition blinded her to everything that was unique and special about Buffalo Valley.</p><p>\u201cSay something!\u201d she shrilled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good start.\u201d Her stance relaxed somewhat.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything, though.\u201d He wasn\u2019t being purposely cruel, only frank. \u201cI\u2019m going to do everything I can to keep Value-X out of Buffalo Valley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mad at me,\u201d she insisted. \u201cAll this craziness about moving to some backwoods town is a form of punishment. You\u2019re trying to make me regret what I said. Vaughn, you simply don\u2019t understand how important Value-X is to me and to our future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatalie\u2014\u201d</p><p>She ignored him and started pacing. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been good together, Vaughn, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave we, Natalie?\u201d he asked, hoping she was capable of admitting the truth.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let you do this,\u201d she said, clenching her fists.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re destroying your career!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to work for a company like Value-X. Not now and not in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he told her, and it was true. He\u2019d fight the big retailer for as long as his money held out, but after that...he didn\u2019t have any answers.</p><p>\u201cI can help you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re this rough-and-ready Airborne Ranger, trying to be a hero. But you\u2019ve got to face reality. No one goes against Value-X and walks away a winner. This will cost you more than you can afford to lose.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her threat. \u201cThanks but no thanks,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She looked crestfallen.</p><p>Vaughn had a few questions of his own. \u201cWhy did you tell Carrie we\u2019re engaged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we are!\u201d she cried. \u201cDid we or did we not discuss marriage?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond. She already had her answer.</p><p>\u201cOh, I get it,\u201d Natalie raged, her eyes spitting fire. \u201cYou found yourself a little side dish while you were away visiting Mom and Dad. You forgot all about me. Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t engaged and we aren\u2019t getting married.\u201d She couldn\u2019t seriously believe he intended to continue this relationship when it was obviously a dead end for both of them.</p><p>\u201cBut we did discuss marriage on more than one occasion, and I never said I wouldn\u2019t marry you. We both understood we\u2019d get married someday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see it that way. Yes, we talked about marriage, but there was no commitment\u2014and very little interest on your part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re lying, too.\u201d</p><p>He bristled, but bit his tongue before he said something he\u2019d regret.</p><p>\u201cWell...it\u2019s sort of a lie.\u201d Natalie lowered her head. \u201cI made a mistake, but not once did I say anything about breaking off our relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d He didn\u2019t know how much plainer he could be.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWell, if you insist on this lunacy, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWe could\u2019ve been very good together,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and you\u2019ll be a whole lot sorrier once Value-X is through with this town.\u201d She rallied then, jerking her head up, chin tilted. \u201cIf you want to freeze your butt off in this horrible place, then go right ahead.\u201d She reached for her coat and yanked it toward her.</p><p>The sound of several car doors closing distracted Vaughn. He glanced out the window to see all four of Carrie\u2019s brothers standing in the driveway. He could only surmise that they\u2019d come en masse to finish him off.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d Natalie asked.</p><p>\u201cThe firing squad,\u201d Vaughn answered.</p><p>\u201cTerrific. Can I fire the first shot?\u201d</p><p>Vaughn didn\u2019t respond to her sarcasm. He headed toward the front door, opening it for the four men who marched, single file, into the house. Soon Carrie\u2019s brothers stood in the middle of the room, looking from Vaughn to Natalie and then back.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Chuck demanded. \u201cYou left town without saying a word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t meet with Heath,\u201d Vaughn started to explain, but wasn\u2019t given the opportunity before another question was hurled at him.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to introduce us to your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Natalie Nichols.\u201d She introduced herself, stepping forward and offering each of the Hendrickson brothers her hand. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not Vaughn\u2019s sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who are you?\u201d Ken asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cHis fianc\u00e9e. Or I was,\u201d she said, \u201cuntil recently, but now Vaughn\u2019s met someone else. He just told me that he no longer wishes to marry me.\u201d She appeared to be making a brave effort to hold her chin high and keep her lower lip from trembling. He\u2019d never realized what a good actress Natalie was.</p><p>Vaughn resisted rolling his eyes. He remained silent, preferring not to get drawn into a theatrical scene in which he was identified as the villain.</p><p>\u201cSomeone will need to give me directions back to my hotel.\u201d She pulled a tissue from her pocket and dabbed at her eyes, being careful not to smear her mascara.</p><p>\u201cI can get you there.\u201d Ken stepped forward. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to help.\u201d</p><p>Tom\u2019s gaze narrowed on Vaughn. \u201cDid she have something to do with the fact that you didn\u2019t see Heath?\u201d</p><p>Vaughn shook his head, surprised the Hendrickson brothers hadn\u2019t already heard. \u201cThe land sold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>All four brothers started speaking at once. As luck would have it, Vaughn\u2019s parents chose that precise moment to reappear.</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard voices,\u201d his mother said as she came into the living room.</p><p>Tom motioned with his head toward Natalie. \u201cYou\u2019d better have a good explanation,\u201d he muttered. \u201cYou\u2019d better not be engaged to her and seeing Carrie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Pete agreed. \u201cThis is all some kind of misunderstanding, isn\u2019t it? Didn\u2019t I tell you I\u2019d make you pay if you hurt my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was never actually engaged,\u201d his mother said, hurrying to defend Vaughn. \u201cWhat he told us is\u2014\u201d</p><p>That was when his father stepped into the fray. \u201cBarbara, let Vaughn answer for himself, would you?\u201d</p><p>This was impossible. Everyone talked at once. Part of the conversation had to do with the land; everyone was clearly upset about that. Then Pete and his mother got involved in a debate about whether Vaughn should be dating Carrie. In the meantime, Ken and Natalie had apparently struck up a friendly conversation. They sat next to each other on the sofa, so close that their knees touched. Vaughn could only guess what she was saying, but frankly, he couldn\u2019t care less.</p><p>Before everything blew up in his face, Vaughn walked through the kitchen, grabbed his coat and stepped out the back door. He got into his car, which fortunately hadn\u2019t been blocked by the other vehicles. Glancing toward the house, he saw everyone gathered in front of the big window in the living room, staring at him. They must have been dumbfounded, because no one seemed to be speaking.</p><p>When he reached the end of the long driveway, Vaughn had to make a decision. He could go searching for solitude, a quiet place to recover his dignity. Or he could drive back to Buffalo Valley.</p><p>He chose Buffalo Valley. When he\u2019d finished breaking Hassie\u2019s heart, he\u2019d do what he could to mend Carrie\u2019s. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d never meant to hurt Carrie, but that didn\u2019t discount the fact that he\u2019d misled her. This wasn\u2019t exactly his finest hour.</p><p>When they\u2019d first met, he\u2019d found her charming. Later, when he got to know her, he\u2019d been enchanted by her warmth, delighted by her love of family and home. Those were qualities that had come to mean a great deal to him. Carrie was genuine, and she was authentic in her relationships. Unlike him...</p><p>Vaughn wanted to kick himself for not being honest with her from the start. He didn\u2019t have a single excuse. All he could do now was pray that she\u2019d be willing to accept him\u2014and that she\u2019d give him an opportunity to prove himself.</p><p>The hour\u2019s drive into town passed in a blur, and practically before he knew it he\u2019d pulled off the highway and turned onto what were now familiar roads. Buffalo Valley stretched before him, but he viewed it with new eyes. He recalled his first visit, recalled how stark and bare the town had seemed, almost as if it were devoid of personality. He\u2019d soon recognized how wrong he was.</p> <p>While the buildings might be outdated and the lampposts antiques, the town itself represented the very heart of the country. The heart of America\u2019s heartland. It was where he wanted to be, how he wanted to live.</p><p>His mind was clear now. Easing the car into a parking space on Main Street, Vaughn forced himself to consider what he\u2019d say to Hassie. It wasn\u2019t a task he relished.</p><p>All his talk of opening a feed store had done nothing but build up her hopes. Now he was about to disillusion an old woman who\u2019d invested her whole life in a town that couldn\u2019t be saved. Whatever happened, though, he was staying in Buffalo Valley; he\u2019d be part of its struggle and part of its future.</p><p>He dared not put this off any longer, and drawing a deep breath, he walked into the pharmacy.</p><p>The instant she saw him, Hassie cried out his name. \u201cVaughn, oh, Vaughn.\u201d Tears streaked her weathered cheeks as she hurried across the store, her arms stretched out toward him.</p> <p>Apparently someone had already brought her the news. Holding open his own arms as she came to him, he hugged her, the sound of her sobs echoing in his ears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Vaughn whispered, wondering what he could say that would comfort her.</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d Hassie eased back, gazing at him through watery eyes. \u201cIn the name of heaven, why would you be sorry? This is what we\u2019ve hoped for all along.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn stared at her, not knowing what to think. \u201cThe land sold, Hassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d She clapped her hands, eyes sparkling with delight. \u201cThis is better than anything I could\u2019ve imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...confused.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d She patted his back and led him to the soda fountain. \u201cSit down,\u201d she ordered. \u201cIf there was ever a time for one of my chocolate sodas, this is it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about Value-X?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey lost the land. The women of Buffalo Valley got to Ambrose before he signed the deal with Value-X and they bought it out from under the company. The ladies convinced Ambrose he\u2019d be making a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn knew that several of the women in town owned businesses; he knew they had a big stake in the community. It floored him that they\u2019d managed to do what no one else had deemed possible.</p><p>\u201cBut how...when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you recall when the women got together?\u201d Hassie asked, leaning over the refrigeration unit, scooping up the ice cream.</p><p>\u201cI remember a cookie exchange.\u201d Carrie had mentioned something along those lines earlier in the week.</p><p>\u201cThe meeting took place after that,\u201d Hassie said. \u201cThen a committee of six paid Ambrose a visit. I don\u2019t know everything they said, but apparently they convinced him to sell them those twenty acres. I hear they twisted his arm by appealing to his vanity\u2014promising to name the school after him. He liked that. He also liked the fact that he could sell his land at the same price Value-X offered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs Value-X seeking out any other property?\u201d</p><p>Hassie grinned. \u201cThey can try, but there isn\u2019t a single person in this area who\u2019d sell to them\u2014not at any price.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn nodded, still feeling a little numb. \u201cWhat do the women intend to do with the property?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Hassie\u2019s grin widened. \u201cYou mean you don\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t. Since they were all capable, business-minded individuals, Vaughn suspected they already had plans.</p><p>Hassie chuckled softly. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask them, but my guess is they\u2019d be willing to sell you a portion of it\u2014that is, if you\u2019re still inclined to settle in Buffalo Valley.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn could barely to take it in. \u201cYou mean that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to Sarah Urlacher and she\u2019ll give you all the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to see Carrie first.\u201d</p><p>Hassie set the glass on the counter. \u201cAh, yes, Carrie.\u201d She made a tsking sound and plunked a paper straw into the thick chocolate soda. \u201cYou\u2019ve got your work cut out there.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn wrapped his hand around the glass, feeling the cold against his palm. \u201cI assume she\u2019s upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way of putting it.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn slid off the stool. He didn\u2019t want to offend Hassie by not drinking the soda, but he\u2019d feel worlds better once he resolved the situation with Carrie. \u201cShe at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubt it.\u201d Hassie reached for the soda herself and took a long sip before she continued. \u201cMy guess is she\u2019s sitting on the swings over in the park. I found she likes to go there when something\u2019s troubling her. Look there first and if you can\u2019t find her, then check the house.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn thanked her and left immediately. He jogged across the street to the park. The snow forts he\u2019d helped build on Christmas Day\u2014was that only yesterday?\u2014were still standing, a little the worse for wear. Following the freshly shoveled walk, Vaughn made his way toward the play equipment.</p><p>Hassie had, as always, given him the right advice. Carrie sat in the middle swing. Her face was red from the cold, and he wondered how long she\u2019d been there.</p><p>Vaughn ached to tell her how sorry he was, but he feared that if he said or did the wrong thing now, he might lose her forever.</p><p>As he approached, Carrie glanced up, but she didn\u2019t acknowledge him. Vaughn, needing to gather his thoughts, didn\u2019t say anything, either. Instead, he settled into the swing beside her and waited for the words to come.</p><p>\u201cI hurt you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d he asked after an awkward moment.</p><p>\u201cWere you engaged to her when you came to town?\u201d</p><p>This was the difficult part. \u201cNo. No, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed to think so.\u201d</p><p>He gripped the chain and shifted sideways to see Carrie more clearly. \u201cBefore I left Seattle, Natalie and I talked about marriage.\u201d</p><p>The words seemed to hit her hard.</p><p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently she\u2019s changed her mind.\u201d</p><p>Vaughn saw that Carrie was staring straight ahead, as though mesmerized by whatever she was watching. \u201cSo have I.\u201d</p><p>Carrie turned toward him, but when their eyes met, she turned away again. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be a very fickle man, Vaughn Kyle, to ask one woman to marry you and then, while she\u2019s making up her mind, start seeing another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize how bad it sounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds, nothing! Underhanded and unfair is more like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said simply. \u201cI have no excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must\u2019ve really enjoyed hearing me spill out my heart.\u201d She covered her cheeks with both hands and closed her eyes, as if remembering the things she\u2019d said. They seemed to embarrass her now.</p><p>\u201cCarrie, no! It wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d He thought about the afternoon she\u2019d told him about her ex-husband. He didn\u2019t know how to put into words what her trust had done for him. How her straightforward devotion had wiped out the cynicism he\u2019d felt after Natalie\u2019s opportunistic approach to love and marriage.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certainly not the kind of man I\u2019d want in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you, Carrie....\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what, comic relief?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only known each other a short while. Who can say where this relationship will take us? Maybe you\u2019re right. After you get to know me better, you could very well decide you don\u2019t want any more to do with me. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll accept it. All I\u2019m asking for is a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo break my heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, to give you mine.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him for the longest time. Finally her mouth twisted wryly and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of what my brothers will do to you once they learn about...Natalie, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo man in his right mind would voluntarily tangle with your brothers,\u201d he replied, deciding this was not the moment to tell her they\u2019d already met the woman in question. \u201cHowever, I figure I can take them on if it comes to that. What I\u2019m telling you now has nothing to do with your brothers. It\u2019s how I feel about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d she cried with such passion that Vaughn jumped. \u201cDon\u2019t say things you don\u2019t mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am completely sincere.\u201d He slid off the swing and crouched down in front of her. He wanted her to see how vulnerable he was to her. Taking her right hand in his, he removed her glove and kissed the inside of her palm.</p><p>She pulled back her hand.</p><p>\u201cI plan to stay in Buffalo Valley,\u201d he continued, undaunted.</p><p>Her eyes widened, but she bit her lower lip as if to suppress her reaction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to invest in the community, become part of it, make a contribution.\u201d</p><p>Carrie\u2019s gaze darted away and then returned. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me things like that just because you think it\u2019s what I want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true, Carrie.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and lowered her chin. \u201cI want so badly to believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me,\u201d he whispered, then nuzzled her throat. He didn\u2019t kiss her, although the temptation was strong. \u201cAll I\u2019m asking for is another chance,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cOh, Vaughn.\u201d She pressed her hands against his shoulders\u2014to bring him closer or push him away?</p><p>Vaughn helped make the decision for her. Crouched down as he was, his face level with her own, he leaned toward her and grazed her lips with his. Her mouth was cold, yet moist and welcoming. She moaned softly and he rubbed his warm lips over hers, seducing her into deepening the kiss.</p><p>One moment he was crouched in front of Carrie and she was leaning forward, giving herself to the kiss. The next he was losing his balance and tumbling backward.</p><p>Carrie let out a small cry of alarm as she went with him. Vaughn did what he could to protect her. He threw his arms around her waist and took the brunt of the impact as she landed on top of him in the snow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve knocked me off balance from the moment we met,\u201d he said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Carrie smiled then, for the first time since he\u2019d joined her. \u201cYou\u2019ve done the same thing to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo promises, Vaughn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d He brushed the hair from her face, barely aware of the snow and the cold.</p> <p>She frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s promise every time I look at you, Carrie Hendrickson. Promise each time I kiss you.\u201d Then, because he couldn\u2019t keep himself from doing so, he showed her exactly what he meant.</p><p>As soon as their lips met, Carrie whimpered and he wrapped his arms more firmly around her.</p><p>\u201cThis is only the beginning for us,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Carrie placed her head on his shoulder and gave a shuddering sigh.</p> <p>\u201cI was never really worried about your brothers,\u201d Vaughn confessed. \u201cYou were always the one who terrified me.\u201d He laughed and rolled, reversing their positions in the snow. Her eyes were smiling as he gazed down on her.</p><p>\u201cSo you want to give me your heart?\u201d she said, looking up at him. She flattened her hand against his coat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already have it.\u201d And then he went about proving it. </p>  </body></html>"]
