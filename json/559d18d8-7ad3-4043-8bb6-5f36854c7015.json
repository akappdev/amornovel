He should not have studied her that first time and should have kept his gaze downcast all the times since. He was a slave to the prince of darkness, spawned by evil; she was a goddess, created in light.</p><p>He could not have her, he thought, hands fisting. No matter how much he might wish otherwise. She would not want him anyway. This...obsession was pointless and brought him nothing but despair. He did not need more despair.</p><p>And yet, still he watched her this day as she floated through the barren cavern, coral-tipped fingers tracing the jagged stones that separated underground from underworld. Golden ringlets flowed down her elegant back and framed a face so perfect, so lovely, Aphrodite herself could not compare. Eyes of starlight narrowed, a rosy color blooming in those cheeks of smooth alabaster.</p> <p>\u201cThe wall is cracked,\u201d she said, her voice like a song amid the hiss of nearby flames\u2014and the unnatural screams that always accompanied them.</p><p>He shook his head, positive he had merely imagined the words. In all their centuries together, they had never spoken, never deviated from their routine. As the Guardian of Hell, he ensured the gate remained closed until a spirit needed to be cast inside. That way, no one and nothing escaped\u2014and if they tried, he rendered punishment. As the goddess of Oppression, she fortified the physical barrier with only a touch. Silence was never breeched.</p><p>Uncertainty darkened her features. \u201cHave you nothing to say?\u201d</p><p>She stood in front of him a moment later, though he never saw her move. The scent of honeysuckle suddenly overshadowed the stink of sulfur and melting flesh, and he inhaled deeply, closing his eyes in ecstasy. Oh, that she would remain just as she was....</p><p>\u201cGuardian,\u201d she prompted.</p> <p>\u201cGoddess.\u201d He forced his lids to open gradually, slowly revealing the glow of her beauty. Up close, she was not as perfect as he had thought. She was better. A smattering of freckles dotted her sweetly sloped nose, and dimples appeared with the curve of her half-smile. Exquisite.</p><p>What did she think of him? he wondered.</p><p>She probably thought him a monster, hideous and misshapen. Which he was. But if she thought so, she did not show it. Only curiosity rested in those starlight eyes. For the wall, he suspected, not for him. Even when he\u2019d been human, women had wanted nothing to do with him. They\u2019d run from him the moment he\u2019d turned his attention to them. He\u2019d been too tall, too brawny, too bumbling. And that was before he\u2019d resembled an ogre.</p><p>Sometimes he wondered if he\u2019d been tainted at birth.</p><p>\u201cThose cracks were not there yesterday,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat has caused such damage? And so swiftly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA horde of Demon Lords rise from the pit daily and fight to break out. They have grown tired of their confinement here and seek living humans to torment.\u201d</p> <p>She accepted the news without reaction. \u201cHave you their names?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. He did not need to see beyond the gate to know who visited on the other side; he sensed it. Always. \u201cViolence, Death, Lies, Doubt, Misery. Shall I go on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI understand. The worst of the worst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They bang and they claw from the other side, desperate to reach the mortal realm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, stop them.\u201d A command, laced with husky entreaty.</p><p>If only. He would have given up the last vestiges of his humanity to do as she wished. Anything to repay the daily gift of her presence. Anything to keep her just where she was, prolonging the sweetness of her scent. \u201cI am forbidden to leave my post, just as I am forbidden to open the gates for any reason but allowing one of the damned inside. I\u2019m afraid I cannot grant your request.\u201d</p><p>Besides, the only way to stop a determined demon was to kill it, and killing a High Lord was another forbidden act.</p><p>A sigh slipped from her. \u201cDo you always do as you\u2019re told?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways.\u201d Once he had fought the invisible ties that bound him. Once, but no longer. To fight was to invite pain and suffering\u2014not for him, but for others. Innocent humans who resembled his mother, his father and his brothers\u2014because his true mother, father and brothers had already been slain\u2014were brought here and tortured in front of him. The screams...oh, the screams. Far worse than the ones that seeped from Hell. And the sights... He shuddered.</p><p>Had the pain and suffering been heaped upon him, he would not have cared. Would have laughed and fought all the harder. What was a little more pain? But Lucifer, brother to Hades and prince of the demons, needed him healthy, whole, so had found other ways to gain his cooperation.</p><p>The memories would forever haunt him, but might have faded during the night, if he\u2019d required sleep. He remained awake, however, every hour of every day, never able to forget.</p><p>\u201cObedience. I expected differently from you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are a warrior, so strong and assured.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he was a warrior. But he was also a slave. One did not cancel out the other. \u201cI am sorry, goddess. My strength and assurance change nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will pay you to help me,\u201d she insisted. \u201cName your price. Whatever you desire shall be yours.\u201d</p><p>If only, Geryon thought again. He would ask for a single taste of her lips.</p><p>Why limit himself, though? he wondered next. Whatever he desired. He could ask for a night in her arms. Naked. Touching. Tasting. Yes. Yes. Every muscle in his body clenched. In arousal. In desperation.</p><p>In despair.</p><p>No. He could not risk the suffering of the innocent\u2014why do you bother with them?\u2014simply to sate his craving for the lovely goddess. So have a kiss? A night with her? No again.</p><p>Finally I know true torture. He ground his teeth. Why did he bother? Because without good, there would be only evil. And he had seen too much evil over the centuries. He would not be responsible for more.</p><p>\u201cGuardian?\u201d the goddess prompted. \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>DO NOT SPEAK. DO NOT DO THIS. Geryon gulped. \u201cI am sorry, goddess.\u201d No. Say no more. Ask for that kiss, at the very least. \u201cAs I told you, I cannot help you.\u201d No, no, no.</p><p>How he hated himself just then.</p><p>Her delicate shoulders sagged in disappointment, and his self-hatred grew. \u201cBut...why? You want to keep the demons in Hell just as much as I do. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Geryon didn\u2019t want to tell her his reasons for refusing her, was still ashamed after all this time. Tell her, however, he would. Perhaps then she would return to the old ways and pretend he did not exist. As it was, his craving for her was deepening, intensifying, his body hardening. Readying.</p><p>She\u2019s not for you.</p><p>How many times would he need the reminder before this conversation ended?</p><p>\u201cI sold my soul,\u201d he admitted. He had been one of the first humans to walk the earth. Despite his massive build and bumbling ways, he\u2019d been content with his lot and enraptured by his mate, even though she\u2019d been chosen by his family and, like all the other females of his acquaintance, had not desired him in return.</p><p>A year into their marriage, she had grown sick, and he had despaired. Though she had found no joy with him, she had belonged to him, and ensuring her safety and well-being had been his duty. So he had cried out to the gods for assistance.</p><p>They had ignored him, and his despair became unbearable.</p><p>That was when Lucifer appeared before him. So cunning, that one was.</p><p>To save his mate\u2014and perhaps finally win her heart\u2014Geryon had willingly given himself to the dark prince. And found himself transformed from man to beast. Horns had sprouted atop his head, and his hands had become clubs, his nails claws. Dark, carmine fur had covered the skin on his legs, while hooves replaced his feet.</p><p>In seconds, he\u2019d been more animal than human.</p><p>His wife had healed, as his contract with Lucifer stated, but she had not softened toward Geryon. No, his selfless act had meant nothing to her and she had left him for another man. A man she had apparently been seeing all along.</p><p>What a fool he\u2019d been. A cuckold. All for nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhat thoughts fill your head, Guardian? Never have you appeared so...broken.\u201d</p><p>The goddess. His hands fisted, claws digging deep into his palms, as he refocused on her. There had been compassion in her tone. Compassion he must ignore. Unemotional, that\u2019s how he had to be. Always. Otherwise, he would not survive his time here.</p><p>\u201cMy actions are no longer mine to command. No matter how I wish otherwise, I cannot help you. Now please. Don\u2019t you have duties to attend to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am doing my duty now. Are you?\u201d</p><p>He flushed.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cForgive my waspishness. I am frazzled.\u201d The goddess studied him, her head tilting to the side. He shifted uncomfortably, such scrutiny unnerving given his sickening appearance. To his surprise, revulsion did not darken her lovely gaze as she said, \u201cYour soul belongs to the dark prince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if your soul was returned to you, you would aid me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he repeated, the word a croak. Would she still offer him a boon for that aid?</p><p>\u201cVery well. I will see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened in horror. Approach Lucifer? \u201cNo, you must\u2014\u201d</p><p>She disappeared before he could stop her.</p><p>Inner Corridors of Hell</p><p>\u201cLUCIFER, HEAR ME WELL. I demand to speak with you. You will appear before me. This day, in this room. Alone. I will remain exactly as I am.\u201d Kadence, goddess of Oppression, knew to state her wants precisely or the demon prince would \u201cinterpret\u201d them however he wished. \u201cAnd you will be clothed.\u201d</p><p>Were she simply to demand an audience, he might whisk her to his bed, her arms and legs tied, her clothing gone, a legion of fiends surrounding her.</p><p>Several minutes ticked by and there was no response to her summons. But then, she\u2019d known there wouldn\u2019t be. He enjoyed making her wait. Made him feel powerful. Keep busy. Act as if you do not care. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kadence eyed her surroundings, as if studying them was exactly what she\u2019d come to do. Rather than stone and mortar, the walls of Lucifer\u2019s palace were comprised of flames. Crackling, orange-gold. Deadly.</p><p>His throne was comprised of bone, ash and more of those flames. Off to the side was a bloodstained altar. A lifeless body still lay across it\u2014minus a head. The head would reattach all too soon, however, so that the torturing could begin anew. That was the way of it here.</p><p>No soul would escape. Even in death.</p> <p>She hated everything about this place. Plumes of black smoke wafted from the blazes, curling around her like fingers of the damned. So badly she wanted to wave her hand in front of her nose, but she did not. She wouldn\u2019t show weakness\u2014even with so small an action.</p><p>Did she dare, she knew she would find herself drowning in the noxious fumes. Lucifer loved nothing more than exploiting vulnerabilities.</p><p>Kadence had learned that lesson well. The first time she had visited, she\u2019d come to inform both Hades and Lucifer that she had been appointed their warden. As one who embodied the essence of subjugation and conquest, there was no one better to ensure that demons and dead alike remained here.</p><p>Or so the gods had thought, which was why they\u2019d chosen her for this task.</p><p>She had not agreed, but refusing them would have invited punishment. Many times since accepting, however, she\u2019d thought perhaps punishment would have been better. Having stones thrown at her, bloody carcasses left on her doorstep in warning...they hardly compared to spending her days sleeping in a nearby cave\u2014not a true sleep but a watchful one, her mind\u2019s eye drifting over the different demon camps. Could hardly compare to spending her nights surveying a wall of rock.</p> <p>As the Guardian watched.</p><p>That, however, was not such a hardship.</p><p>For many years, his attention had unnerved her, for he was unlike anyone she had ever met: half man, half beast, all...edge. But then she\u2019d come to find comfort in his detached gaze. He protected her from demons and souls who slipped through the gate, attacking everyone in their path. No matter the harm to himself.</p><p>She could do no less for him.</p><p>I sold my soul, he\u2019d said. For what? she wondered. What had he received in return? Did he consider the trade a good one? She\u2019d wanted to ask him, but had recalled how uncomfortable he had been with her questions about the wall. He would not have welcomed a discussion about something so personal.</p><p>And that was probably for the best. Only her job mattered right now. How could she not have known demon High Lords were determined to escape forever?</p> <p>Had Lucifer somehow blocked her visions of this realm? He was the only one strong enough to do so. If so, what did he hope to gain? Were she to ask, he would merely lie, that much she knew.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt more helpless.</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t true. During her first visit, Lucifer had sensed her trepidation\u2014and he\u2019d since used every opportunity to nurture it. A fire-coated touch here, a wicked taunt there. Every time she had come here to report an infraction, she had wilted under his attentions.</p><p>That had disappointed the gods. They would have called her home, she was sure, had they not already bound her to the wall, an act that had been meant to help with her duties, not hinder them. But not even the gods had known just how deeply the bond would go. Rather than simply sensing when the wall needed fortification, she\u2019d realized it was her reason for living.</p><p>Her blood now sang with its essence.</p><p>The first time one of the demons had scratched it, she\u2019d felt the sting and had gasped, shocked. Now, it no longer shocked her, though she still felt every contact. When a soul brushed it, her skin felt tickled. When the inferno licked at it, she felt burned. So why had she not sensed these latest ministrations?</p><p>Oh, she\u2019d felt her body draining of strength, little by little, pains shooting through her seemingly for no reason, but her visions had been calm. Well, as calm as such visions could be, considering what she was forced to witness on a daily basis.</p><p>Now, at least, she knew why she\u2019d hurt. Bound as she was to this dark underworld, that crack in the outer wall was literally killing her.</p> <p>You are losing focus. Concentrate! Distraction could cost her. Dearly. And the outcome of this meeting was more important than any that had come before it.</p><p>From outside the palace she could hear the crazed laughter of the demons, the moans of the tortured and the sizzle of flesh pouring from bone. And the smell...it was a hell all its own.</p><p>It was difficult, remaining stoic amidst such vileness. Especially now. The High Lords must have been working on the wall for weeks. Because if her side was cracked, she shuddered to think of the damage on Hell\u2019s side. At the very least, she should have seen the demons approach. But again, her visions had remained calm.</p><p>Enough of this. Clearly, she could not concentrate.</p><p>\u201cLucifer,\u201d she called again. \u201cYou heard my demands. Now heed them. Or I will leave and you will miss this opportunity to bargain.\u201d</p><p>The pound of footsteps suddenly echoed and the flames several feet in front of her parted. Finally. In strolled Lucifer, as carefree as a summer day.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did hear them,\u201d he said in the silkiest of voices. He even grinned, the expression pure wickedness. \u201cYou mentioned a bargain? What can I do for you, my darling?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>KADENCE DIDN\u2019T ALLOW herself to shudder.</p><p>Lucifer was tall, muscled like a warrior and sensually handsome despite the dark inferno raging in his eyes. But he did not compare to the beast who guarded his domain. The beast whose face was too rough to be considered anything other than savage. The beast whose massive body should have frightened her but only made her feel safe. The beast whose monstrous appearance should have disgusted her but didn\u2019t. Instead, his brown eyes\u2014eyes she\u2019d once considered impassive, but after today, now saw as haunted\u2014captivated her. And, of course, his protective nature intrigued her.</p><p>She might never have become interested in the Guardian, might have continued to assume he was like every other hated creature here, but then he\u2019d saved her life that first time. Sadly, even immortal goddesses could be slain\u2014a prospect that had never been clearer as the outer gates had parted to welcome a spirit and a minion slipped free, racing toward her, hungry for living flesh.</p><p>She\u2019d frozen, knowing her death was imminent.</p><p>The Guardian\u2014what was his name?\u2014had intervened, destroying the fiend with one swipe of his poisoned claw before it had made contact with her. He hadn\u2019t spoken to her afterward, and she hadn\u2019t spoken to him, her belief that he was like all the other creatures in this underworld shaken but not yet completely broken.</p><p>She\u2019d begun to study him, though. Over time, she\u2019d become fascinated by his complexities.</p><p>He was a destroyer, yet he\u2019d saved her. He had nothing, yet he hadn\u2019t asked for anything in exchange. How rare that was. How strange. How...welcome. She now wanted to do something for him. Anything, as she\u2019d told him. And for one stolen moment, she\u2019d thought he meant to request a kiss. His gaze had fallen to her lips, and lingered. Utter longing had radiated from him.</p><p>Please, she had almost begged. Her heart rate had sped up, her mouth had watered. What would he taste like? But then his expression had cleared, he had looked away and shaken his head. No.</p><p>Her disappointment had nearly felled her. Push him, however, she would not do. He\u2019d already done so much for her. Still, she couldn\u2019t help but wonder, hope...did he favor her in return? For that stolen moment, she would have sworn she saw white-hot flames in his eyes, flames that had nothing to do with the damned.</p><p>\u201cAm I so boring you cannot grant me your attention after you summoned me? Twice.\u201d</p><p>The question returned her to the present, and she could have slapped herself. Do you want to lose this match of wits with the prince of darkness? \u201cBoring?\u201d She shrugged. To say yes would be asking him to liven things up. To say no would be telling him she enjoyed him. In his mind, at least. Neither would end well for her.</p><p>Lucifer regarded her silently as he settled atop his throne. Instantly, swirling, ghostly souls began writhing between the bones and ash. A bejeweled goblet materialized, already clutched in his hand, and he sipped from it. A drop of crimson slid down the corner of his mouth and trickled onto his stark white shirt. Blood.</p><p>Revulsion besieged her, but she kept her expression neutral.</p><p>\u201cYou are disgusted by me but do not show it,\u201d he said with another of those wicked smiles. \u201cWhere is the mouse who usually visits? The one who trembles and stumbles over her words? I like her better.\u201d</p><p>Kadence raised her chin. He could call her all the names he wished, but she wouldn\u2019t comment. \u201cYour walls have been compromised, and a horde of demons fights to escape.\u201d</p><p>The prince quickly lost his smile. \u201cYou lie. They would not dare.\u201d</p><p>His agitation was understandable. Without his legions, he would have no one to rule. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Your band of thieves, rapists and murderers would not dare disobey their sovereign.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed in a show of anger. One he quickly masked by shrugging casually. \u201cSo the walls are compromised. What do you expect me to do about it?\u201d</p><p>She should not have been surprised. Always he made things difficult. \u201cThe Guardian. He can help me stop the ones responsible. But as you own his soul, he must first gain your permission.\u201d</p><p>Lucifer snorted. \u201cNo. I will not grant it. Not for any reason. I like him where he is.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Difficult. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a reason? Well, then. Let\u2019s see. Let\u2019s see.\u201d He tapped his chin with a fingertip. \u201cWhat about, my last guard fell victim to a demon\u2019s lies and almost allowed a legion to escape.\u201d</p><p>A lie of his own? The Guardian she knew had been here far longer than she, so she did not know if anyone else had ever stood in his place. \u201cThis one could just as easily fall.\u201d Now that was a lie. No one was more determined. There would be no falling. Not for him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lucifer shook his head. \u201cGeryon is impervious to their wiles.\u201d</p><p>Geryon. Finally. A name. Greek in origin, meaning monster. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>He was more than his appearance. Far more.</p><p>\u201cNothing else to say?\u201d Lucifer asked. \u201cShall we part, then?\u201d</p> <p>She barely stopped herself from running her tongue over her teeth. Was this a game he played? He needed the wall repaired as much as she did. Well, not as much as she did, she mused. Unlike her, he would not die if the wall crumbled. Still. His resistance grated.</p><p>With that thought, she answered her own question. Yes, this was a game. One she would not tolerate. \u201cI am your sovereign,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not my sovereign,\u201d he growled in another display of anger. Another display he quickly hid. A single breath in and out, and he visibly calmed. \u201cYou are my...observer. You watch, you advise and you protect, but you do not command.\u201d</p><p>Because you are too weak, he did not say. But then, he didn\u2019t have to. They both knew it was true.</p><p>She wanted to be different. Strong. She truly did. And she should have been. Once, she had been. Her very nature was one of subjugation, after all. For others, though, and not herself. Or that\u2019s the way it had been. Why was she like this now?</p> <p>You know the answer, and you would do well to forget it.</p><p>She squared her shoulders, realizing she would have to play Lucifer\u2019s game, after all. There was no other way. You can do this. For Geryon. \u201cI believe I offered to bargain with you, and you were amenable. Shall we begin?\u201d she asked silkily.</p><p>He nodded, as if he\u2019d merely been waiting for the question all along. \u201cWe shall.\u201d</p><p>Gates of Hell</p><p>\u201cI DO NOT UNDERSTAND,\u201d Geryon said, refusing to leave his post. He even crossed his arms over his chest, an action that reminded him of his human days, when he\u2019d been more than guard, more than monster. \u201cLucifer would never have agreed to release me from his...care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you, he agreed. You are free.\u201d The goddess cast her gaze to her sandaled feet, saying no more on the subject. \u201cFinally.\u201d</p> <p>Did she hide something? Plan to trick him, for whatever reason? It had been so long since he\u2019d dealt with a female, he wasn\u2019t sure how to judge her actions. Her, though, he wanted to believe. Anything and everything she said. And that was what scared him most.</p><p>She could destroy him and his poor heart. Or rather, what remained of it. If anything did.</p><p>She was paler than usual, he noted, the rosy glow in her cheeks gone, her freckles stark. Her golden ringlets tumbled down her shoulders and arms, and he could see soot woven throughout the fine strands. His hands ached to reach out, to sift those tresses through his fingers.</p><p>Would she run screaming if he did so? Probably.</p><p>Today she wore a violet robe and matching necklace\u2014a necklace that boasted a teardrop amethyst as large as his fist and as bright as the glistening ice of his homeland. Ice he had not seen in hundreds of years. She had never worn such a thing before; usually she draped herself in white, an angel among evil, with no adornment.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he persisted. \u201cWhy?\u201d And why do you look so sad?</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Her gaze lifted, boring into him with the precision of a spear and cutting just as deep.</p><p>There was fury blended with her sadness. He did not like either. This female should only ever be happy. \u201cTo me, yes.\u201d But only because it was necessary to his survival. Anything else, and he might have caved then and there. Given her whatever she desired. Even follow her into the fires behind him, as she\u2019d first requested.</p> <p>She gave a little stomp of her foot. \u201cTo save the wall, I need your help. Let that be enough of an answer for now. You know Lucifer would not want it to fall.\u201d Her fingers beckoned him. \u201cCome. See the damage that has been done on this side. See why I must cross over.\u201d</p><p>The goddess did not await his reply. She turned away from him and walked to the far corner of the wall. No, not walked. She glided, a dream of falling stars amid shimmering twilight.</p><p>Why do you want to survive? What good does living do you? Geryon hesitated only a moment before following her, breathing deeply of her honeysuckle scent along the way.</p><p>To his surprise, no one jumped from the shadows as he walked; no one waited to punish him for daring to leave his post. Was he truly free? Dare he hope?</p><p>The goddess didn\u2019t face him when he reached her, but traced a fingertip along a thin, jagged groove in the middle stone. A groove that branched into smaller striations, like tiny rivers flowing from a churning ocean.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s small, I know, but already it has grown from what I saw yesterday. If the demons continue their abuse, it will continue to grow until the rock splits completely in two, allowing legions to enter the human realm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere a single demon released upon the unsuspecting world,\u201d he muttered, \u201cdeath and destruction would reign.\u201d Whether or not a punishment would be delivered to him, he would help her, Geryon decided. He could not allow such a thing to happen. Innocence should never be taken from the undeserving. It was too precious.</p><p>\u201cIf I do this... If I help you...\u201d</p><p>Still she didn\u2019t face him. \u201cYes?\u201d A breathy sigh.</p><p>\u201cI will earn that boon? Whatever I desire?\u201d How selfish he was to ask, he thought, but he did not take the words back.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d No hesitation. Still breathy.</p><p>What did she think he would ask for? \u201cThen so be it. I accept. I will lead you into Hell, goddess.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>THE GODDESS GAVE A STARTLED gasp and flicked him the briefest of glances. \u201cYou\u2019ll help me? Even knowing you are no longer bound to the prince? That you could leave?\u201d</p><p>His chest constricted at that glimpse of starlight eyes and lush red lips. \u201cYes. Even knowing.\u201d If she spoke true and he was free, he had no place to go. Too many centuries had passed, and his home was now gone. His family, dead. Without a doubt, he would cause riots with his appearance. Besides, he might crave the very freedom the goddess promised but he still feared trusting her. She might not intend malice, but Lucifer certainly would.</p><p>With the prince, there was always a catch. Free today did not necessarily mean free tomorrow. And since his soul had not been returned to him...</p><p>No, he dare not hope.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I didn\u2019t expect\u2014I\u2014 Why did you sell your soul?\u201d she asked softly, tracing the crack again.</p><p>A change of subject. One he was not prepared for.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d he asked rather than answer. He did not wish to admit the reason for his folly and the subsequent humiliation.</p><p>Her arm dropped to her side, and she faced him fully. As his gaze drank her in, her expression softened. \u201cI am Kadence,\u201d she said, as though he had asked for her name rather than instruction.</p><p>Kadence. How he loved the way the syllables rolled through his mind, smooth as velvet\u2014gods, how long since he\u2019d touched a material so fine?\u2014and sweet as wine. How long since he\u2019d tasted such a drink?</p><p>\u201cI am Geryon.\u201d Once, he\u2019d had a different name. Upon arriving here, however, Lucifer had given him his current moniker. Monster was the literal translation, but in truth it meant Guardian of the Damned, which was what he was and all he would ever be. Soul or not.</p><p>Some legends, a demon had once jeered at him, proclaimed him to be a three-headed centaur. Some, a vicious dog. Some, the leavings of a warrior named Hercules. Anything was better than the truth, however, so he did not mind the stories.</p><p>\u201cI am yours to command,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cKadence.\u201d Tasted even better on his tongue.</p><p>Breath caught in her throat; he heard the hitch of it. \u201cYou say my name like a prayer.\u201d There was no astonishment in her tone. Only...uncertainty?</p><p>Had he done so? \u201cI am sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d Her cheeks flushed prettily. Then she clapped her hands and brought the conversation back to what should have been their primary concern. \u201cOur first order of business is to patch those cracks.\u201d</p><p>He nodded but said, \u201cI fear the wall is already compromised.\u201d Outer damage was fixable. But not inner. In walls or in immortals, he thought, thinking of the inner scars he must bare. \u201cPatching will merely strengthen it for a time.\u201d But might not prevent an eventual fall, he did not add.</p><p>What they would do then, he did not know. Chaos would reign. Souls and demons would be able to leave at will.</p><p>Something more would have to be done. But again, he did not know what.</p><p>\u201cYes. Knowing demons as I have come to, they will return and inflict more damage.\u201d Once more she lifted her gaze to him, kernels of fear swirling where there should only be satisfaction. A crime. \u201cGeryon,\u201d she began, only to press her lush lips together.</p><p>What was left of his heart skidded to an abrupt stop. She was just so lovely, her gentleness and goodness setting her apart from everything he represented. He wanted to duck his head, hide his ugliness from her. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Why so uncomfortable? \u201cYou may speak freely with me, goddess.\u201d Whatever she needed, he would provide.</p><p>\u201cKadence. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKadence,\u201d he said again, and savored. So good...</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 What boon would you ask of me?\u201d</p><p>That was not what she\u2019d meant to ask, he knew it, and could only gape at her, trying not to panic. He had hoped to discuss this after. \u201cA...a kiss.\u201d He waited for her screech of horror. Her denial.</p><p>Instead, she merely opened her mouth in a wide O.</p><p>\u201cYou may close your eyes and imagine you are with someone else,\u201d he rushed out. \u201cOr refuse me. I would understand.\u201d Stop talking. You\u2019re only making things worse.</p><p>\u201cI would not refuse,\u201d she said softly, huskily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014 I\u2014\u201d Now he was the one to stutter. She would not refuse?</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cShall I give you a kiss now?\u201d</p><p>Now? Suddenly he had trouble breathing. Standing. His knees were shaking, his limbs as heavy as boulders. Dark spots winked over his vision. Now? he wondered again, wildly this time.</p><p>He was not ready. He would make a fool of himself, and she would leave him. No longer want his help. Or worse, she would cast him pitying, disgusted glances the entire time they worked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAfter,\u201d he managed to croak.</p><p>Was that...disappointment clouding her expression? Surely not.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d she said. No emotion. \u201cAfter. But Geryon, I must warn you. There is a chance we will not survive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter we have repaired the wall, we must hunt and kill the demons who would destroy it. Are you sure you wish to wait?\u201d</p><p>Hunt and destroy the demons. Of course. The answer was so clear, he was embarrassed that he had not thought of it. By killing the High Lords, they would be committing a crime, and they would be punished. Perhaps be put to death.</p><p>\u201cSo...your kiss?\u201d she prompted softly.</p><p>Had he not known better, he would almost think her...eager.</p> <p>But he did know better. Agreeing to Lucifer\u2019s bargain had been difficult. Or so he\u2019d thought at the time. This was a thousand times more so. \u201cAfter,\u201d he repeated. He would earn that kiss, and hopefully, she would not ever think back on it and consider him unworthy.</p><p>She nodded, and once again looked away from him. \u201cThen let us begin our work.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>FOR HOURS G ERYON WORKED at repairing the outer wall, pleading with Kadence all the while to remain behind. Demons were dangerous, he said. Demons liked their prey alive and fresh, he said. What he did not say was that she was fragile, breakable. No, he did not need to say it; she read the thoughts in the ever-growing concern in his eyes.</p><p>Through it all, she refused to allow him to be alone. She had not bartered something that would surely earn her the wrath of the gods, only to send him on a mission he could not hope to win without her.</p><p>While the demons were not hers to command, she could force them to bow to her. She hoped. Besides, she might appear fragile and breakable, but she possessed a core of iron.</p> <p>Something she\u2019d finally proven to Lucifer earlier. As well as herself.</p><p>As a child, she had been an indomitable force. A whirlwind that trampled anything and everything in her path. It had not been intentional. She\u2019d simply followed the quiet urgings inside her head. Dominate. Master.</p><p>Do you really wish to think of this now?</p><p>No better time, she supposed. Only other thing to think about was why Geryon had not wanted to kiss her when she\u2019d offered. Why he\u2019d actually looked alarmed. A few ideas came to mind: he did not really want to kiss her\u2014but why then would he have requested one? Or he resented her for asking for his aid\u2014this was the most likely\u2014and last, he was simply desperate for a woman, she was the only one available, yet he had to force his body to react first.</p><p>Embarrassing!</p><p>Not helping.</p><p>She could have helped him rather than simply pondering, but he had shooed her away every time she tried. When she joined him anyway, he\u2019d threatened to leave her if she did not stop. So here she was, doing nothing. Useless.</p><p>I am not weak, damn it. Even though, for the most part, I have acted like it.</p> <p>When, as a child, she\u2019d realized she had chipped away at her own mother\u2019s strength of mind, turning the once vibrant goddess into a lifeless shell, she had retreated inside herself, afraid of who and what she was. Afraid of what she could do, unintentional though it was.</p><p>Sadly, with those fears came others, as if she\u2019d opened a doorway in her mind and placed a welcome mat out front. Fear of people, places, emotions. For centuries she had acted like the mouse Lucifer had called her.</p><p>Underneath the fears, however, she was still the goddess she\u2019d been born to be: Oppression. She conquered. She did not cower. Please, do not let me cower. Not any longer.</p><p>\u201cI have done all I can for the outer wall,\u201d Geryon suddenly said.</p><p>Kadence had been perched on a nearby rock, and now stood. Her robe fell to her ankles, swaying.</p><p>\u201cOnce I pry the gate\u2019s boulders apart\u2014\u201d boulders that blocked the cavern from a yawning pit \u201c\u2014we must hurry. We will only have a small slit to pass through, but we cannot let that slow us.\u201d</p><p>Or someone\u2014or thing\u2014could escape. \u201cI understand,\u201d she said, closing the distance between them.</p><p>\u201cThere will be no ledge for us to stand upon. We must hold on to the boulder and work our way down the pit.\u201d</p><p>Only after she nodded did he shove and push, creating the aforementioned slit.</p><p>Instantly flames and scaled arms reached out. Screams permeated the air. Geryon entered first, commanding all to recede. To her surprise, the demons darted away, the flames died, and the screams quieted as she came through, her body swinging from the natural world into the spiritual one. Part of her wanted to believe they had done so because they\u2019d been afraid of her. The other part of her knew they\u2019d feared Geryon\u2019s wrath.</p><p>She held onto the boulder with every bit of her strength as Geryon closed the slit. To let go was to freefall into Hell, a fiery pit just waiting to gobble them up.</p><p>Palms...sweating...</p><p>\u201cReady, goddess?\u201d He inched his way toward her. He had swung to the left of the gate, and she the right. \u201cReady?\u201d he insisted, reaching for her. To protect her? Aid her?</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Finally, I will know his touch. Surely it will not be as divine as my body expects. Nothing could be. But just before contact, he moved behind her, then away from her, all without touching her. She sighed in disappointment and tightened her grip on the wall, balancing her feet on a rocky protrusion as best she could.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d He motioned toward this side\u2019s crack with a tilt of his chin.</p><p>\u201cAll right. And Geryon? Thank you. For everything.\u201d Usually she whisked herself to Lucifer\u2019s palace without ever opening the gate, too afraid of this. Not today. She couldn\u2019t. For she could not whisk Geryon. Or anyone else, for that matter. The ability extended only to herself.</p><p>\u201cYou are welcome.\u201d</p><p>As she passed, she waved one hand over the now-closed slit. Because there was no longer a guardian stationed out front, the extra fortification would be needed\u2014despite the fact that providing it weakened her, forcing her to leave a piece of herself behind.</p><p>As fragments of her power adhered to the stones, she was careful to maintain distance from them. Supposedly Geryon was the only one who could touch the handles of the gate without consequence. Well, besides Hades and Lucifer. Anyone else, the stones heaped untold pain and horror upon.</p><p>She had never dared test the supposition.</p><p>A thought occurred to her, and she tilted her head, studying her companion. Without Geryon at the gate, who would open the stones to allow damned souls inside?</p><p>Perhaps Lucifer had already appointed another Guardian. Perhaps? She chuckled without humor. He had. He couldn\u2019t leave the gates unguarded, even if he had known Kadence would refortify it.</p><p>The knowledge that Geryon would not be the man she saw every day...saddened her. For when the wall was safe\u2014she would not allow herself to believe she would fail in this mission\u2014Geryon could leave, but she would be stuck here.</p><p>Do not think about that now. She would cry. If she cried, her vision would blur and if her vision blurred, she would have trouble knowing where to place her hands. Her still sweating hands.</p><p>She glanced around. The air was smokier here, she noticed, hotter. So hot, in fact, that the sheen of sweat spread up her arms, her neck, even her face. Beads formed, and those beads began trickling down her temples, blurring her vision.</p><p>\u201cGeryon,\u201d she said, nearing a panic.</p><p>\u201cI am here, Kadence.\u201d In the next instant, he was climbing over her and positioning himself behind again. The scent of decadent, powerful male enveloped her, chasing away the pungent odor of decay. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered, but gods, what had she gotten herself into?</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>\u201cMOVE WITH ME,\u201d Geryon told Kadence. \u201cCan you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course.\u201d Could she? Maintaining a firm grip, she used the jagged stones to edge along, ever conscious of the seemingly endless void awaiting her should she lose her balance\u2014but far more aware of the male still behind her, caging her in, keeping her steady. \u201cPerhaps the wall is not as damaged as I feared. A goddess can hope, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a goddess can hope.\u201d</p><p>How she yearned to rub against him, to drink in his strength, belong to him if only for a moment, but she did not, too afraid of distracting him. Or startling him. Or giving him too much of her weight and causing him to fall.</p><p>A rock tumbled from the small ledge on which she had just placed her foot, and she yelped.</p><p>\u201cDo not show your fear in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe demons and the flames feed on it, will try to increase it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are alive? The flames, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of them, yes.\u201d</p><p>Dear gods. How had she not known? \u201cI did not imagine the climb would be difficult. I wish I could flash us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ability to move from one location to another with only a thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have this ability?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can go anywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere I have already been. To flash somewhere I have not is...dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment. \u201cHave you been to the bottom of this cavern?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He had to wonder why she, one of the keepers of Hell, had not physically visited every inch. She had thought herself so clever, merely sending her mind through to watch. But she realized her mistake now.</p><p>\u201cThen I ask that you do not try to flash. You might misjudge the distance and end up in a spot without a ledge.\u201d</p><p>Or underground, but she did not tell him that.</p><p>\u201cThat is a handy power to possess. I envy you.\u201d</p><p>Poor man. He\u2019d been stuck at the gates of Hell for countless lifetimes. \u201cIf you could flash to anywhere in the world, where would you go?\u201d Once they\u2019d destroyed the demons trying to escape, perhaps she would take him there. She would not be able to remain with him, of course, but seeing his happiness could fuel her fantasies for years to come.</p><p>He grunted. \u201cI do not wish to lie to you, goddess, therefore I will not answer your question.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh. \u201cI appreciate your honesty.\u201d Why won\u2019t he talk to me?</p><p>Curiosity bombarded her. Did his answer embarrass him, perhaps? If so, why? She desperately wanted to know, but let the matter drop. For now.</p><p>\u201cWe are almost there,\u201d he said. Almost at the crack.</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d He was still close to her, still behind her, but he made sure not to touch her. Yet he couldn\u2019t stop his heat from enveloping her. It was not a heat she minded, even amidst the smoldering furnace that was Hell. His was...heady.</p><p>He stopped, forcing her to do the same. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say it\u2019s worse than I thought it would be.\u201d His breath trekked over the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014what?\u201d she asked, horrified. Being near her was worse than he\u2019d thought?</p><p>\u201cThe wall. What else?\u201d</p><p>Thank the gods, she thought, expelling a breath. Foolish woman. Her life depended on this wall. She should not care whether a man found her attractive. Or not.</p> <p>She forced her gaze straight ahead, her mind to center on her job, not the intriguing man behind her. Thick claw marks abounded. And what had appeared to be thin grooves on the other side were massive craters here.</p><p>Hope abandoned her.</p><p>Irreparable. In every way.</p><p>\u201cThey are more determined than I realized,\u201d was all she said, voice trembling slightly. No reason to speak her fears aloud. Geryon might think she was complaining about his work or doubting his abilities.</p><p>He adjusted his grip, his arm just over her shoulder. A tremor raked her. If she stood on her tiptoes, she would feel his skin through her chimation. Though it had been hundreds of years since she\u2019d had a man, she remembered the comfort such simple contact could offer.</p><p>\u201cDo not worry, Kadence. I will not allow them to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>He was using her name more freely now, and that gladdened her. \u201cJust so you know, I will not allow them to hurt you, either.\u201d It was a vow.</p><p>There was a pause. Then, \u201cThank you.\u201d He sounded unsure.</p><p>\u201cYou are welcome.\u201d</p><p>She thought she heard him swallow. \u201cShall I try and patch this side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Too much effort for too little reward. She realized that now. \u201cWe should make our way to the bottom. Destroying the High Lords is the only way to prevent more damage.\u201d</p><p>Evil laughter erupted behind them, and they both stiffened.</p><p>Demons.</p><p>\u201cLeave us,\u201d Geryon snapped.</p> <p>The laughter increased in volume. Drew closer.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI cannot battle them like this, and they know it,\u201d he muttered, latching onto her waist.</p><p>She gasped. Finally. He was touching her. It was amazing and wonderful, wild and intense. But there was no comfort in it, as she\u2019d expected. No, instead she experienced white-hot, searing arousal. And a burning desire for more.</p><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to fall, Kadence,\u201d he said, and then he released the rocks, taking her over the edge with him.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>THEY SEEMED TO FALL FOREVER. Geryon retained an iron-edged grip on the trembling Kadence, her hair whipping around them like angry silk ribbons. She didn\u2019t scream, something he\u2019d expected, but she did turn and wind her legs around him, something he had not.</p><p>It was his first taste of heaven. In this life, and his other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d he said. Her body fit perfectly against his, soft where he was hard, smooth where he was callused.</p><p>\u201cWhen does it end?\u201d she whispered, but still he caught the undercurrents of panic in her voice.</p><p>They were not twirling, were merely dropping, but he knew the sensation could be harrowing. Especially, he reflected, for one used to flashing from one place to another.</p><p>\u201cSoon.\u201d He\u2019d fallen like this only once before, when Lucifer summoned him to the palace to explain his new duties. But he had never forgotten the experience.</p><p>Like before, flames kindled all around them, pinpricks of gold in the shuddering darkness. Except before, those flames had flicked like snake tongues, licking at him. That they didn\u2019t now...did they fear him? Or the goddess?</p><p>She was more everything than Geryon had realized. More courageous. More determined. Every minute he spent with her, his desire for her intensified. She was the break of dawn in the bleakness that was his life. She was refreshing ice in smoldering heat.</p><p>She is not for you.</p><p>Ugly as he was, she would run fast and far if she knew the many fantasies his mind had begun to weave of them. Him, laying her on the ground, stripping her, dancing his tongue over every delicious inch of her. Her, moaning in pleasure as he tasted her core. Crying out in abandon as he filled her with his shaft. Far more than the kiss she would have allowed him.</p><p>A kiss born of...pity? Or gratitude?</p><p>He found he desired neither. He wanted her to want his kiss.</p><p>And damn himself to everlasting eternity, why had he not taken her lips when she\u2019d offered them? In pity, gratitude or not. What a fool he was! What a coward.</p><p>Did the opportunity arise again, he would pounce.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked, her still-rising panic evident.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong,\u201d he lied. \u201cSome have called this the never ending pit, but I assure you, there is an end. Just a little farther and we\u2019ll hit. Landing will jar you, but I\u2019ll absorb most of the impact.\u201d He moved one of his hands up and onto the base of her neck. Offering comfort, he told himself. He\u2019d tried not to touch her, had fought it, but there\u2019d been no other way to protect her inside the pit.</p><p>Besides, what was the harm in adjusting a single hand?</p><p>\u201cBut you stiffened.\u201d</p><p>I must stop craving her. Her skin was soft, so soft, and he felt little bumps rise under his palm as he gently massaged. To his delight, her muscles relaxed under his ministrations.</p><p>Apparently, there was a lot of harm. His shaft hardened unexpectedly, and his cheeks heated. Could she feel the evidence of his arousal? It was buried beneath his only piece of armor, so perhaps she would think the metal responsible.</p><p>And you are a fool.</p><p>\u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re hiding something, I can tell. I know this pit is made for souls, not breathing, flesh-and-blood bodies. Are we going to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I swear it. We will live.\u201d The conversation seemed to calm her, so he said, \u201cTell me about you. About your childhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014all right. But there\u2019s not much to tell. I was not allowed out of my home as a child. For the greater good,\u201d she added, as though the line had been fed to her many times before.</p><p>He did not mean to, would have stopped himself if he\u2019d realized, but he found himself hugging her tight, understanding. Because of her nature, she\u2019d been as much an outcast as he was. \u201cKadence, I\u2014\u201d The air was thickening around them, the flames spraying what looked to be molten teardrops. He recognized the signs; the end was near. \u201cDrop your legs from me, but do not let them touch the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll righ\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>Too late.</p><p>Boom. They smacked into the ground and Geryon planted his feet as the impact vibrated through him. He tried to remain upright to keep the goddess from having to touch the bones littering the area, but his knees soon gave out and he collapsed backward.</p><p>Kadence remained in his arms, unwinding her legs as he\u2019d asked, so his back took the brunt of the fall, breath knocking from his lungs.</p><p>He lay there for a moment, panting. They were well and truly inside Hell.</p><p>There was no going back now.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>\u201cGERYON? A RE YOU ALL RIGHT?\u201d</p><p>The muted darkness of the pit had given way to bright light, fire illuminating every direction. Kadence hovered over him, like the sun he sometimes glimpsed in his daydreams, bright and glorious. \u201cI am...fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re wheezing. What can I do to help?\u201d</p><p>He was surprised to note she did not scramble off him, now that they were safe. Well, as safe as a person could be inside Hell. \u201cTell me more about yourself. While I catch my breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, of course.\u201d As she spoke, her delicate hands wisped over his brow, his jaw, his shoulders. Searching for injuries? Offering comfort? \u201cWhat should I tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d He was growing stronger by the second, but he did not admit it. Rather, he luxuriated in the sensation of her touch. \u201cEverything. I want to know all about you.\u201d Truth.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I...goodness, this is hard. I guess I\u2019ll start at the beginning. My mother is the goddess of Happiness. Odd, I know, that such a woman could give birth to one such as me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy odd?\u201d When looking at Kadence, hearing her voice, breathing in her scent, gave him more joy than he\u2019d ever known?</p><p>\u201cBecause of what I am,\u201d she said, clearly ashamed. \u201cBecause of the damage I can cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have known nothing but\u2014\u201d pleasure, hunger, desperation \u201c\u2014kindness at your hands.\u201d</p><p>Her ministrations ceased, and he could feel her gaze boring into him. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, truly.\u201d Do not stop touching me. Centuries had passed since he\u2019d last enjoyed even the slightest hint of contact. This was nirvana, paradise and a dream all wrapped into one delightful package. \u201cMy head,\u201d he found himself saying on a moan.</p><p>\u201cPoor baby,\u201d she cooed, massaging his temples.</p><p>He nearly smiled. Now was not the time for this. They were inside Hell, out in the open, possible targets. The demons at the gate could have followed them. But he could not help himself, was too desperate, greedy. Just a little longer. \u201cYour story,\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cWhere was I? Oh, yes.\u201d Her honeysuckle scent enveloped him, chasing away the odor of rot. \u201cI was a mean little girl. I didn\u2019t share my toys, and I frequently made the other children cry, unintentionally compelling them to bend to my will. All right, perhaps a few of those times it was not so unintentional. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons I was sent to Hell as warden, though it was never said aloud. The gods wanted to be rid of me, once and for all.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How forlorn she sounded. \u201cEvery living creature has made a mistake at one point or another. Besides, you were a child. Not yet sensitized to the feelings of others. Do not blame yourself. They should not have. They knew better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of you?\u201d she asked, and this time she sounded more buoyant.</p><p>I did that. I encouraged her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d he wondered.</p><p>Slowly she grinned. \u201cAnything. Everything.\u201d</p><p>That grin...one of the gods\u2019 finest creations, surely. His gut clenched. His shaft hardened again.</p><p>\u201cI need a moment to think.\u201d He\u2019d relegated his human memories to a far corner in his mind, never to be considered again. Before, thinking of those days had stung, for he\u2019d known they were forever lost\u2014but he reminded himself that with his wife\u2019s desertion, that was a good thing. Today, however, with the essence of Kadence all around him, he experienced only a thrum of sadness for what might have been.</p><p>\u201cI was a wild child, untamable, a roamer,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother despaired, thinking I would worry her and every member of our family to death.\u201d He laughed, her sweetly aged face flashing in his mind. \u201cThen they introduced me to Evangeline. She calmed me, because I wanted to be worthy of her. We married, as both our families desired.\u201d</p> <p>Kadence stiffened. Even paled. The hand she\u2019d been dancing at his temple stilled. \u201cYou are...wed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am sorry,\u201d she said, but there was relief in her tone.</p><p>Relief? Why? \u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d Had he not given his soul for Evangeline, she would have died. And had she not left Geryon, he might have fought Lucifer when the time came to become Guardian. And had he fought, he might not have met Kadence.</p><p>In that moment, he had never been so glad of something.</p><p>Suddenly a frenzied snarl echoed through the distance, trailed by more demon laughter. They had indeed been followed.</p> <p>Giving up all pretense of being winded, Geryon popped to a stand, lifting the goddess with him and searching the distance.</p><p>The horde was several yards away. But as he watched, a fiend separated from the pack and raced straight for them.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>GERYON SHOVED K ADENCE behind him. Another touch\u2014 warmth, satin skin, perfection\u2014and he yearned to revel in it. He didn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t. He\u2019d agreed to come with her to save the human realm, yes, but also to keep her safe. Not because she was a goddess and not because she was the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever beheld, but because, in this single day, she had made him feel like a man. Not a beast.</p><p>\u201cRemember that I swore to let no harm befall you,\u201d he told her. A minute, perhaps two, and the creature would reach them. Fast as it was, there was still a great distance to cover, the streets of Hell stretching endlessly. \u201cI will keep my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeryon. Perhaps I can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He didn\u2019t want her involved in this fight. Already she was trembling in fear. She was so scared, in fact, she had yet to realize her hands were resting on his back, twin conductors of inexorable pleasure. Had she known, surely she would have jerked away. \u201cI will fight it.\u201d Should she try to do so, it would feed off her fear, becoming more crazed.</p><p>As did most minions, the creature coming at them possessed a skeletal face and a muscled body covered in green scales, its forked tongue flicking out as if blood already coated the air. Glowing red eyes glared at them, a thousand sins resting where pupils should have.</p> <p>Warrior instincts demanded Geryon stride forward and meet the bastard in the middle. Fight there, like true soldiers. Yet his every male instinct demanded he stay where he was. To put any distance between himself and Kadence was to place her in further danger. Another demon could be hiding nearby, waiting for the chance to pounce on her. Another of the horde could separate, circle around and try to take her from behind.</p><p>\u201cThis is my fault,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter that I had begun to relax, my fear of this place is bone-deep. And that fear is like a beacon to them, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He chose not to answer that, too afraid of scaring her further by acknowledging the truth of her words. \u201cWhen it reaches us, I want you to run backward. Press against the wall and scream for me if you see any hint of another demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to help you. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do as I said. Otherwise, I will defeat it and leave this place.\u201d His tone was uncompromising. Already he regretted bringing her here, whether the wall needed defending or not. Whether innocents needed saving or not.</p><p>She was more important, he realized.</p><p>She stiffened against him, but didn\u2019t offer another protest.</p><p>A cry of \u201cMine, mine, mine\u201d rent the air.</p><p>The creature closed in, faster...almost...there. Claws raked at Geryon as he grabbed his opponent by the neck. Multiple stings erupted on his face, followed by the trickle of warm blood. Flailing arms, kicking legs.</p><p>Only when the temptation of Kadence\u2019s hands fell away did Geryon truly begin to battle. He tossed the creature to the ground and leapt upon it, knees pinning its shoulders. One punch, two, three.</p><p>It bucked, wild and feral. Saliva gleamed on its fangs as curses sprang from its bony mouth. Another punch. Still another. But the pounding failed to subdue it in any way.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Violence? Death? Doubt?\u201d he gritted out. They were why he was here, after all.</p><p>The struggling continued, intensified, terror leaping to life in those red eyes. Not fear for what Geryon would do, he knew, but terror for what its brothers-in-evil would do if they learned of any betrayal.</p><p>Though Geryon hated for Kadence to see him kill brutally, savagely\u2014again\u2014it could not be helped. He raised his hand, spread his elongating, dripping nails and struck. The poison that coated his nails was a \u201cgift\u201d from Lucifer to aid in his duties and acted swiftly, without mercy, spreading through the creature\u2019s body and rotting it from the inside out.</p><p>It screamed and screeched in agony, its struggles becoming writhing spasms. Then the scales began to burn away, smoking, sizzling, leaving only more of that ugly bone. But the bones, too, disintegrated and black ash soon coated the air, blowing in every direction.</p><p>Geryon stood to shaky legs. \u201cYou are next,\u201d he shouted to the others.</p><p>They quickly scampered away.</p><p>How long would they stay gone, though?</p><p>He should move on. Instead, he kept his back to Kadence for several minutes, waiting, hoping\u2014dreading\u2014that she would say something. What did she think of him now? Would there be any more of her tending? Would she rescind her offer of a kiss?</p><p>Finally curiosity got the better of him and he pivoted on his heels.</p><p>She stood exactly as he\u2019d commanded, her back pressed against the rocky wall. Those glorious ringlets cascaded around her. Her eyes were wide and filled with...admiration? Surely not.</p><p>\u201cKadence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Do not speak. Come to me,\u201d she said, and crooked her finger.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>KADENCE HAD BEEN UNABLE to hold back her entreaty. Geryon stood several feet away, panting shallowly, his cheeks cut and bleeding, his hands dripping with his opponent\u2019s lifeblood.</p><p>His dark eyes were more haunted than she\u2019d ever seen them.</p><p>\u201cCome to me,\u201d she said again. And again, she motioned him over with a wave of her fingers.</p><p>The first time, he\u2019d given no reaction. As though he hadn\u2019t believed he\u2019d heard her correctly. This time, he blinked. Shook his head. \u201cYou wish to...punish me for my actions?\u201d</p><p>Silly man. Punish him? When he\u2019d saved her? Yes, part of her was angry that he\u2019d kept her from the fight, that he\u2019d threatened\u2014vowed\u2014to leave without doing what they\u2019d come here to do. Yet again. But part of her was relieved. As the demon had struck at him, she had felt power bloom inside her. Such magnificent, beautiful power. Born of fury, perhaps, but born nonetheless.</p><p>I am not a coward. Not anymore. Next time, I will act. No matter his wishes, no matter mine. He deserves that. Deserves to have someone look out for him.</p><p>\u201cKadence,\u201d Geryon said, and she realized she had been staring at him, silent.</p><p>\u201cI would never punish you for aiding me. No matter your actions. If you learn nothing else about me, learn that.\u201d</p><p>Again he blinked. \u201cBut...I killed. I hurt another creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were injured in the process. Come, let me attend to your wounds.\u201d</p><p>Still he resisted. \u201cBut you would have to put your hands on me.\u201d</p><p>He said it as though the thought should be loathsome to her. \u201cYes, I know. Does the thought bother you?\u201d Please don\u2019t let it bother you. \u201cI mean, I have done so already and you did not seem... I mean...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBother me?\u201d One hesitant step, two. At that pace, he would never reach her.</p><p>Sighing, she closed the rest of the distance herself, twined their fingers\u2014experienced an electric jolt, gasped\u2014and led him to the rocks. \u201cSit. Please.\u201d</p><p>As he obeyed, he tugged his hand from her and rubbed where they\u2019d been connected. Had the same jolt pierced him? She hoped it had, for she did not want to be alone in this...attraction. Yes, attraction, she realized. Physical, erotic. The kind that prompted a woman to leave her inhibitions and invite a man into her bed.</p><p>Whether that invitation was accepted or not was a different story.</p><p>Reluctant as Geryon was, she was positive he would turn her down. As he had done for the kiss. And perhaps that was for the best, she decided now. Her lovemaking tended to scare men away. Because when the pleasure hit her, she could not control her nature. The chains she\u2019d erected broke, unleashing her will with a vengeance.</p><p>Physically, her lovers became her slaves. Mentally, they cursed her, knowing she had stolen their freedom of choice, unwitting though it had been.</p><p>She had never bedded the same man twice, and, after three tries, had stopped altogether. One she had considered bad luck. Two, a coincidence. Three, undeniably her fault.</p><p>How would Geryon respond, though? Would he hate her as the others had? Probably. Already he knew the horrors of being bound to someone else\u2019s will. She would not doubt if freedom was the most precious commodity in his life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And that was as it should be. Natural. Normal. Both of which he probably craved as well.</p><p>She would be more trouble than she was worth.</p><p>Sighing, she tore several strips of cloth from the bottom of her robe and knelt in front of him, between his legs. His shaft was hidden by a short skirt of leather and metal filigree. A warrior\u2019s cloth. Perhaps it was wanton of her, but she wanted to see him there. Despite everything. She licked her lips, thinking maybe, perhaps, what if she did peek? That would not destroy his life and...</p> <p>As if he could read her mind, he sucked in a breath. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>DON\u2019T STOP. D ID HE MEAN for her to move his armor out of the way? Or simply to clean him as she\u2019d promised? Already he was nervous, on edge, and had resisted even the slightest of handling. Afraid to risk a mistake, she leaned in, reached up and mopped the blood from his face with one of the strips of cloth. Acting the coward again, are we?</p> <p>His delectable scent filled her nose, a midnight breeze that inexplicably reminded her of home. A sprawling, opulent home she had not been able to visit since reluctantly agreeing to oversee the fortification of Hell. How she missed it.</p><p>\u201cIn all the years I have known you,\u201d she said, carefully avoiding the deepest gash, \u201cyou have never left your post at the gate. Do you eat?\u201d At first contact, he had jumped. But she maintained a steady, casual rhythm and he gradually relaxed.</p><p>Perhaps one day he would allow her to do more. Would she enslave him, though, as she had the others? Still the question plagued her. If there was a chance that she wouldn\u2019t... What are you doing? She\u2019d already told herself she could not risk it, but hope was a silly thing and refused to leave her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for me to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Even she, a goddess, needed food. She could survive without it, yes, but she would waste away, becoming a mere shell of herself. That was why baskets of fruits and breads were brought to her once a week\u2014along with lectures about her many failures. \u201cHow, then, do you survive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I know only that I stopped needing food the day I was brought here. Perhaps the fire and smoke sustain me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t miss it? The tastes and textures, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve seen even a crumb that I rarely think of food anymore.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to feed him, she thought. Wanted to sweep him out of this nightmare and into a banquet hall with tables piled high, food of every kind gracing their surfaces. She wanted to watch his face light in ecstasy as he sampled one of everything. No one should be forced to go without such nourishment.</p><p>When his face was clean, she switched her attentions to his right arm. Angry claw marks glared at her, and she knew they had to be hurting him. Not by word or deed did he betray it, though. No, he actually seemed...blissful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I do not have the proper medicines to ease your pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no reason to be sorry. I\u2019m grateful for what you\u2019re doing and hope to repay you in kind someday. Not that I desire you to be injured,\u201d he added quickly. \u201cI do not.\u201d Horror blanched his features. \u201cI would hate such a thing. Truly. I only want to see you healthy and whole.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curled into a slow smile. \u201cI understood your meaning.\u201d Finished with her ministrations, she settled her hands in her lap. She didn\u2019t move from her position between his legs, because an idea had taken root in her mind. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t ready for her to remove his armor, but that did not mean he would refuse her...other things. And he\u2019d seemed to enjoy having her hands on him.</p><p>Careful. \u201cMay I ask you a question, Geryon?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded hesitantly. \u201cYou may do anything you like to me.\u201d</p><p>Had he meant the words to emerge so sensually? So husky and rich? Butterflies took flight in her belly. \u201cAre you...do you like me?\u201d</p><p>He looked away from her and gave another nod. \u201cMore than I should,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Those butterflies morphed into ravens, flapping their dark wings wildly. \u201cThen I would like very much if you would kiss me at last.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>KISS HER? \u201cI SHOULDN\u2019T. I can\u2019t.\u201d What are you doing? You just told yourself you would not pass up an opportunity like this again. Geryon\u2019s gaze strayed to her lips. They were lush and red. Glistening. His mouth watered for a taste of them. His horns, sensitive to his emotions as they were, throbbed.</p><p>Those pretty lips dipped into a frown. \u201cWhy not? You just said you liked me. Did you lie to spare my feelings?\u201d</p><p>If only it were that easy. \u201cI would never lie to you. And I do like you. You are beautiful and strong, the finest thing I have ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think me beautiful? Strong?\u201d Pleasure lit her expression. \u201cThen why won\u2019t you kiss me?\u201d</p><p>Yes, you fool. What reasons do you have now? \u201cI will hurt you.\u201d Oh. Why hadn\u2019t he thought of that before? It was irrefutable. And the only guarantee he would keep his lips to himself.</p><p>Her face scrunched adorably in her confusion. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. You\u2019ve never hurt me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy teeth...they are too sharp.\u201d He didn\u2019t add that his hands were too toxic, his strength too mighty. Were he to lose control of himself and squeeze her, which was a possibility considering how much he desired her, she would be hurt. Scared, too. Perhaps even irreparably damaged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to risk it,\u201d she said, placing her palms on his thighs and burning him soul-deep.</p><p>He both hated and loved his half-armor at that moment. Hated because it kept him from skin-to-fur contact. Loved because it blocked her gaze from parts of his monstrous form.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d What reason could she possibly have for wanting to place her luscious lips on something so disgusting? Mere curiosity would not drive a female to such an act. Evangeline had vomited the moment she\u2019d first spied his changed appearance. \u201cI could tolerate what you were, but I cannot tolerate...this,\u201d she\u2019d thrown at him.</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d Twin pink circles painted Kadence\u2019s cheeks, but she didn\u2019t turn her gaze.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he insisted. He placed his hands atop hers. Gulped at the headiness, the silkiness.</p><p>\u201cYou saved me.\u201d</p><p>So she was grateful. Exactly as he had suspected\u2014and had not wanted. His shoulders sagged in disappointment. Did you truly expect her to desire you? No, he hadn\u2019t expected it\u2014but he had hoped. \u201cIt would be dishonorable to kiss you for such a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I owe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I release you from that vow.\u201d Foolish again!</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Though she remained on her knees, she rose until they were merely a whisper apart. \u201cDo it because I\u2019m desperate, needy. Do it because I\u2019ve suddenly realized how quickly something can be taken from me, and I wish to know some part of you before I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you\u2019re...\u201d he managed to choke out. She was desperate? Needy? For him?</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>Yes. Yes. Geryon could no longer resist, dishonorable or not. Risk or not. He would be careful, he vowed. So careful. He could not resist her. Would not resist her.</p><p>He bent the rest of the way, softly pressing his mouth against hers. Exquisite. She didn\u2019t pull away. She gasped, lips parting, and he swept his tongue inside. Her taste...so sweet, like a snowstorm after a millennium of fire. Beyond exquisite.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she said. \u201cDeeper. Harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure?\u201d Please, please, please.</p><p>\u201cMore than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d</p><p>Thank the gods. Centuries had passed since he\u2019d kissed a woman and never while in this form, but he began thrusting his tongue against hers, rolling them together, retreating, then going back for more. When he felt his teeth scrape hers, he stiffened. And when she moaned, he tried to pull away. But her arms slid up his chest, one anchoring around his neck, the other caressing a horn. He had to grip his thighs, nails sinking deep, to keep his claws off her.</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he managed to grit out.</p><p>\u201cGood. Me, too.\u201d Her lush breasts pressed into his chest, her nipples hard and searching.</p><p>She truly enjoyed his kiss? Tremors rocked him, their tongues beginning another dance, his muscles tightening against the strain of remaining exactly as he was. With every moment that passed, every breathy sound that emerged from her, his control snapped a little more. He yearned to toss her down, climb atop her and pound, pound so hard he would brand himself on every inch of her. Inside every cell.</p><p>More, more, more. He had to have more. Had to have all.</p><p>Had already given all.</p><p>The realization rocked him. \u201cStop,\u201d he finally said. \u201cWe must stop.\u201d He jerked to his feet, away from her, already mourning the loss of her taste. Shaking. He kept his back to her, panting, his heart racing.</p><p>\u201cDid I do something wrong?\u201d she asked softly, and there was a catch in her voice.</p><p>Oh, yes. You stole a heart I could not afford to give. He\u2019d promised never to lie to her, however, so he merely said, \u201cCome. We have waited long enough. We have demons to hunt.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>THEY STOPPED AT THE FIRST building they came to: a tavern. An actual, honest-to-gods tavern, where blood was served rather than alcohol and body parts were the snacks. Kadence had known such things existed down here, but it still struck her as odd. Demons, acting as humans. In their eerie way.</p><p>She and Geryon had had a two-mile trek from the pit\u2019s entrance to here. A two-mile trek she had spent remembering his earth-shattering kiss, cursing him for stopping it and fretting about his reasons for doing so.</p><p>Throughout her endless life, she had welcomed only those three lovers into her bed, and all three had been gods. If gods had not been able to handle her, there was no way Geryon could. But she had hoped. For once, during that too-short span, she\u2019d had no thoughts of controlling her nature, only enjoying. Oh, had she enjoyed. His taste was divine, his tongue hot and wet, his body a work of art and muscle. So badly she had wanted him to touch her. To strip her and penetrate her. To claim her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yet Geryon had walked away from her, just as the others had.</p><p>Am I so terrible? So horrible a person?</p><p>More than the others, she had wanted Geryon to find pleasure with her because he meant more. She liked who she was with him. Liked how she felt when he was near. Worthy. Precious. Instead, she had...disgusted him? Repelled him? Failed to arouse him in even the slightest way?</p> <p>\u201cStay by my side,\u201d he said as he shoved open the tavern\u2019s swinging double doors. They were the first words he had uttered since reminding her of their quest. \u201cAnd keep your hood over your head. Just in case. Actually, are you versed in glamour?\u201d</p><p>His voice was deep and rough and caressed every one of her weeping senses. Surely she did not disgust him. Surely she did not repel him. He had held himself back during their kiss, had stopped it, but when he looked at her, he made her feel as if she were the only woman in the world. The most beautiful, the most desired.</p><p>He paused before entering. \u201cKadence?\u201d Cleared his throat. \u201cGoddess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will glamour myself and stay by your side,\u201d she told him, though inside she beseeched, Tell me why you continually push me away. She only wanted to draw closer.</p><p>He didn\u2019t, of course. He nodded and stepped forward. She stayed close, as promised, mentally projecting the image of bones and scales. Anyone who glanced in her direction would think they saw one of their own. She could only hope her fear was masked as well. They would not hesitate to devour one of their own.</p> <p>Taunting laughter and pain-filled cries immediately assaulted her ears. Gulping, she sent her gaze around the room. So many demons...they came in every shape and size. Some were like the image she projected, bones and scales. Some were half man, half bull. Some were winged like dragons with snouts to match. Yet all of them crowded a stone slab. A moving slab?</p><p>No, not moving, she realized, horror claiming her in a bruising grip and nearly crushing her lungs. Human spirits were atop the slab. The demons were ripping them apart, eating their insides. Dear gods.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was no peace for the damned. Only endless torture.</p><p>\u201cDisgusting,\u201d she couldn\u2019t help but breathe. \u201cHow can we defeat a horde of these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll we can do is try.\u201d</p><p>Yes. Sadly, they had no guarantee of success. But I told Geryon I would protect him, and I will.</p> <p>\u201cOver here.\u201d He edged them to the side and out of the way, and she knew it was so that they could observe the happenings without drawing notice. \u201cThe creatures you see here are minions, soldiers and servants. They are not what we will be fighting.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s right, she thought, stomach sinking. Violence, Death and the like were Demon Lords. While minions enjoyed their prey\u2019s agony, their main focus was the fulfillment of a single, basic need: hunger.</p><p>The Lords cared only for the agony. Prolonging it, increasing it to the depths of insanity. And the more agony they inflicted, the more screams they elicited, the stronger they became.</p><p>Oh, yes. They were far worse than anything here.</p><p>She would never be able to keep Geryon safe.</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>\u201cSSSMELL GOOD, LIKE FEAR,\u201d something suddenly growled beside Kadence. \u201cMmm, hungry.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she gasped. I\u2019ve already given myself away? She\u2019d just decided to do something, anything to force Geryon to return to the gate. Now this. Hell. No, she thought.</p> <p>Geryon tried to pull her behind him, but she resisted. This time, she wouldn\u2019t sink into the background, forcing him to do all the work, take all the risks. This time, she fought.</p><p>\u201cMove away or die,\u201d she told the demon.</p><p>It frowned at her. \u201cLook like me ssso why you sssmell so good?\u201d It licked its lips, saliva dripping from the corners of its paper-thin mouth. It was covered in yellow scales and only reached her navel. And while it appeared lean, she suspected unyielding strength rested underneath those scales.</p><p>A tremor moved through her. Remember who you are. Remember what you can do.</p><p>It stepped closer. \u201cTassste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were warned,\u201d she said, bracing herself.</p><p>\u201cWait outside, Kadence. Please.\u201d Geryon tried to move in front of her. \u201cI will handle this.\u201d</p><p>She blocked him, not facing him. \u201cNo. You will not fight them alone.\u201d</p><p>As they spoke, the demon continued to inch toward them, its claws lengthening.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Kadence.\u201d Geryon tugged at her. \u201cI need to know you\u2019re safe. Otherwise, I\u2019ll be distracted, and a distracted warrior is a defeated warrior.\u201d</p><p>Defeat would not be theirs. \u201cI cannot act the coward. Not anymore. Besides, if this works, you will not have to fight him at all.\u201d She was Hell\u2019s warden; it was past time she acted like it. Past time she ruled rather than merely observed.</p><p>\u201cIf isn\u2019t good enough. Not when it comes to your safety.\u201d</p><p>She did not have time to bask in his beautiful concern. Any moment the creature would cease its stalking and spring. She knew it, felt it. Kadence reached inside herself as she angled her chin to stare deep into its eyes, surprised to find her power easily accessible. She shouldn\u2019t have been surprised, though. She might try to suppress it, but it was always there, never silent, a churning sea inside her.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t Geryon\u2019s earlier fight proven that?</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d she said, and the creature locked in place, its mind still active but every part of its physical form hers to command.</p><p>For a long while, she simply drank in her handiwork, amazed. I did it. Not once did the fiend try and approach her again\u2014even though murder gleamed in those beady eyes.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s happened,\u201d Geryon said, sounding confused.</p><p>\u201cI happened,\u201d she said, proud of herself. \u201cWatch.\u201d To the demon she said, \u201cRaise your arms over your head.\u201d</p><p>Instantly, it obeyed, shooting both arms into the air without a word of complaint. But then, she had possession of its mouth, as well.</p><p>Joy burst through her. For once, she had used her ability for good: to save someone she greatly lo\u2014admired. Dear gods. Love? Did she love Geryon? She loved being with him, loved the way he made her feel, but did that mean she had given him her heart? Surely not. Surely she was not that foolish.</p><p>Soon they would part.</p><p>\u201cLook, Kadence.\u201d Geryon pointed to the slab. \u201cLook what\u2019s happened.\u201d</p><p>She followed the direction of his finger and gasped. Every demon had frozen in place, their hands in the air. Even the spirits had stopped writhing. There was no laughter, no cries. Only the sound of her own breathing could be heard.</p><p>\u201cYou did this?\u201d Geryon asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am amazed. Awed.\u201d</p><p>Her joy intensified. He admired her. Was perhaps even proud of her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan they hear me?\u201d When she nodded, he slowly grinned and shouted to the creatures, \u201cHear me well. Go forth and tell every Demon Lord the Guardian is here and that I plan to destroy them.\u201d To Kadence he added, \u201cYou may release them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? I could command their bodies to wither and die.\u201d And those bodies would obey. Power...so sweet...</p><p>\u201cI am sure. They are here to punish, so they do serve a purpose. More than that, they will now bring the Lords to us.\u201d</p><p>Though she wanted to protest, Kadence did as he\u2019d asked. In less than a blink, the creatures were racing from the building as fast as possible, leaving her and Geryon alone. \u201cWe must prepare,\u201d Geryon said gravely.</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWar.\u201d</p><p>There would be no taking him back, she realized. Unless she ordered him to return. Which she could do, and he would now be forced to obey. Power... But he would return, she was sure. Too much determination rested in his smoldering eyes.</p><p>You can protect him now, she thought next, and grinned.</p><p>\u201cWar,\u201d she said with a nod. \u201cThat sounds fun.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>GERYON FORTIFIED the building against attack as best as he was able, given the lack of supplies and tools. Kadence remained at his side, lending a spiritual touch whenever needed, forcing the planks and stones to bow to her will. He noticed she grew paler with every minute that passed. A paleness all the more stark when compared to the authority she\u2019d wielded over those demons.</p><p>Why was she weakening?</p><p>Did he have the right to ask? She was a goddess, after all. But that growing paleness did not speak of typical fatigue; it spoke of something more. Something deeper.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s our battle plan?\u201d she asked when they finished, settling against the far wall. The only place without blood or...other things on it.</p><p>Keeping you alive, by whatever means necessary. He joined her, careful not to touch her. One touch, and he would pull her back into his arms. He needed to be alert, on guard. \u201cThe moment they enter, you\u2019ll lock them in place and I\u2019ll slay them with my poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuick and easy,\u201d she said with a ring of satisfaction in her tone.</p><p>He was surprised she was not more fearful, despite her show of power. Maybe because he wanted her fearful. Just a bit, just enough. That was the only way to keep her out of the action. Safe. \u201cBut we must wait until they all arrive, otherwise they will hear of the devastation we have caused and run. And if they run, we might never be able to find them.\u201d</p><p>She absorbed his words. \u201cHow long do you think we have before they begin arriving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few hours. It will take a while for news of my arrival and intentions to spread. Longer still for the Lords to gather their forces and plan an attack.\u201d Geryon raked a claw across the floorboard to mar the curse etched there, shards flying into the air. \u201cI have a question for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk.\u201d</p><p>Did he dare?</p><p>Yes, he thought, glancing at her beauty. He dared. \u201cI understand why Lucifer wishes you to destroy the demons trying to leave Hell and thereby prevent all other demons from following them, but why does it matter so much to you? You were born in the heavens. You could be frolicking there, in the clouds and amid the ambrosia.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMany times I have wished to return. But I willingly agreed to do this job, and do it, I shall. Besides, when I agreed to enter this realm, I became...connected to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConnected? What do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the wall crumbles, I...die.\u201d</p><p>She would die? \u201cWhy did you not tell me before now?\u201d he growled. \u201cAnd why would you connect to such a thing? Why would you come here willingly?\u201d</p> <p>She twisted the fabric of her gown. \u201cHad I remained in the heavens, I would have been punished every minute of every day. No one is crueler in that respect than the gods. They wanted me here, so here I came. But I had no idea how permanent the bonding would be. How powerful. As to why I didn\u2019t tell you before...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cYou had permission to finally leave your post yet you chose to help me. I didn\u2019t want to burden you further. Now you\u2019ve saved me, again, and I don\u2019t wish to lie to you. Even by omission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKadence,\u201d he said, then shook his head. He could not believe this was happening. That he could lose her\u2014and be able to do nothing about it. \u201cI should have remained at the inside of the gate, without you, and slayed the Lords as they approached. Now the wall is without protection, and you are in more danger than ever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They would have seen you and stayed away, for there is no place to hide above the pit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that would have been fine with me. That would have kept you safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet that is no kind of life for you, simply lying in wait.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is the life I am used to.\u201d Truth. But knowing what he did was for her...there was no greater purpose.</p><p>\u201cBut you deserve more!\u201d Looking away from him, she traced a fingertip over the area he had clawed. \u201cWe had to do this. Or rather, I did. But I want you to know that if I fall, the wall will remain as it is, for it isn\u2019t bound to me. I know because I have been hurt many times over the years, yet it did not show signs of damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about the damn wall!\u201d Again, truth.</p><p>Her eyes widened. Then she gulped and continued as if he hadn\u2019t spoken. Or yelled. \u201cWithout me, there will be no one who senses when something is wrong. The gods will have to find someone new. I know you are now free, but would you remain there, vigilant, until that person is found? Even if Lucifer has already appointed a new guardian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not going to die, damn it. Now tell me why Lucifer allowed you inside? Clearly, he needs you outside.\u201d</p><p>Color fused her cheeks. Embarrassment? Guilt? \u201cHe also needs his wall protected at any cost.\u201d</p> <p>Guilt, most definitely. It was there in her voice, echoing off the walls. \u201cHe could have destroyed or imprisoned the Demon Lords.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he could catch them.\u201d</p><p>Geryon didn\u2019t want to, but he nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll give you that.\u201d He tapped two fingers against his chin, pondering the situation. \u201cLucifer allows nothing, even those things he needs, without demanding some form of payment.\u201d Which meant Kadence had had to pay. \u201cWhat did he demand of you? And why did he allow you my services? Why release my soul? And where is my soul now, if Lucifer no longer has it?\u201d Even as he asked the questions, a few of the answers shaped in his mind. He snarled low in his throat. \u201cYou bought me from him.\u201d</p><p>That color in her cheeks deepened. \u201cGeryon, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. Her eyelashes fluttered shut, the length of them casting spiky shadows over her cheeks. One of her hands rubbed at the amethyst dangling between her breasts. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry, either.\u201d</p><p>Was his soul inside that stone? \u201cDid you buy me with...yourself?\u201d If so, he would slay the prince before allowing one evil finger to touch this woman\u2019s precious body.</p><p>A pause, her eyes slowly opening. Then, \u201cNo. I do not wish to discuss this, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care. Tell me.\u201d Anger was building inside of him. Anger with her, with Lucifer, with himself that this could have happened. What had this prized woman given up? Why had she given it up? He placed his hand over hers, not to hold her in place\u2014powerful as he now knew she was, he doubted he could have done so\u2014but to offer reassurance. He was here, he wasn\u2019t leaving. Nothing she said would send him running. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Her chin trembled. \u201cI\u2014I gave him a year on earth, unimpeded, to do as he wished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Kadence,\u201d Geryon said, knowing the other gods would have to honor her bargain\u2014and would make her suffer for it. Everything inside him rebelled at the thought. If they hurt her...you can do nothing. Powerless fool. \u201cWhy would you do such a thing?\u201d A savage whisper. Run, no. He still would not.</p><p>Tears beaded in her eyes. \u201cTo save you. To save me. To save the world beyond our reach. I could think of no other way. A single year to wreak his havoc seemed a small thing to trade in comparison to an eternity of demons roaming free.\u201d Her mouth opened, but rather than words she gave a pained cry.</p><p>Quick as a snap, her skin leached of color and she doubled over.</p><p>Concern instantly rocked him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, sweet? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe demons...I think...I think they\u2019re at the wall. I think they\u2019re killing me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>HAD L UCIFER TOLD THE DEMONS of her bond to the wall? Kadence wondered, pain slicing through her. Rather than come here to fight, they had gone there. Why would they do such a thing unless they knew she would weaken, die?</p><p>Or perhaps they had hoped to draw Geryon to them, leaving her here, alone and seemingly vulnerable to ambush. Or did they want her to come to them? So many alternatives. All of them grim.</p><p>The prince probably found the entire situation vastly amusing. He probably\u2014a sudden thought nearly paralyzed her. If she were killed, he could have more than the agreed upon year on the earth, bartering for souls, causing untold havoc. He could have forever, if he so desired, and he could bring his demons with him, ruling his minions and humans.</p><p>He was a god, a brother to the sovereign. Because of that, there was no guarantee he would be captured and sent back.</p><p>Of course. The perfect plan. He\u2019d wanted her to come here. He\u2019d wanted her to bring Geryon. He\u2019d wanted them both\u2014his only hindrances\u2014to die.</p><p>Oh, gods. She was sickened, for she had unwittingly helped him every step of the way. What kind of fool am I? More than sickened, she was so ashamed.</p><p>So easy. She\u2019d made it so easy for him.</p><p>\u201cKadence, speak to me. Tell me what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Geryon insisted. He popped to his knees and swung around, kneeling between her legs. One of his claws gently, tenderly brushed away the damp hair clinging to her brow.</p><p>Her gaze lifted to his. Seeing him with so much concern in his beautiful brown eyes, the sickness and the shame left her\u2014the pain, though, remained. She suddenly could not regret the choices she\u2019d made. No matter what happened, he would be free. This proud, strong man would finally be free. As he\u2019d always deserved.</p><p>\u201cI...am...fine,\u201d she managed to gasp out. Gods, she felt shredded inside, as though her organs were being ripped to ribbons.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. But you will be.\u201d He scooped her into his arms and carried her to the back. To a room the owner must have used. He laid her on a thin pallet of fur. \u201cMay I?\u201d he asked, lifting the amethyst that housed his soul.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She had planned to present it to him once their mission was completed, a gift for his aid, but she nodded. Right now, there was a good chance she would not complete anything.</p><p>\u201cIs my soul inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. All you must do is hold the stone over your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat easily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she repeated. She wasn\u2019t capable of more.</p><p>Slowly, carefully, he worked the stone from around her neck and placed it over his heart as she\u2019d instructed. His eyes closed. He was probably unsure what would happen. And at first, nothing did. Then, in gradual degrees, the jewel began to glow.</p><p>A frown pulled at Geryon\u2019s lips, and he grunted. \u201cBurns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold it for y\u2014\u201d</p><p>The glow exploded into a thousand pinpricks of light, and he roared, loud and long.</p><p>After the last echo sounded, everything quieted. The lights faded. Only the chain that had held the jewel remained in his hand.</p><p>His frown was lifting into a smile as his eyes opened. But when he studied his arms and then his body, the frown returned, deeper, more intense. \u201cI should have...I did not...I had hoped to return to my former visage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She loved him, just as he was. Horns, fangs, claws and all. Loved. Unquestionably. She had considered it before, but had discarded the idea. Now, there could be no discarding. The emotion was there, undeniable as Death stared her in the face.</p><p>No man had ever been more perfectly suited for her. He was not disgusted by her nature, he reveled in it. He did not fear what she could do, but found pride in it. He delighted her, amused her, tempted her.</p><p>\u201cIt is my hope that...that...\u201d He gulped. \u201cIf you bond with something else, something besides the wall, perhaps your ties to it will lessen and your strength will return. Perhaps the pain will ease.\u201d</p><p>Something else? \u201cYou?\u201d she asked, suddenly breathless for reasons that had nothing to do with pain.</p><p>\u201cYes. Me. I would understand if you choose not to do such a thing. I wanted only to offer the possibility so that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeryon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and kiss me.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>GERYON REMAINED IN PLACE, looking away from her. \u201cFirst, hear me out. I know I\u2019m ugly. I know the thought of being with me in such a manner is abhorrent, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t ugly,\u201d Kadence interjected, \u201cand I do not like that you think you are. I do not like when you demean yourself like that.\u201d</p><p>His attention whipped back to her and he blinked at her, astonishment shining in his expression. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She continued, \u201cThe thought of being with you is welcome. I promise you. Now can we kiss?\u201d</p><p>Now his mouth opened and closed. \u201cWelcome?\u201d</p><p>She supposed not. \u201cYes. But I don\u2019t want you to bond with me simply to save me.\u201d She had once been too afraid to admit she craved his body, had pretended merely to be grateful to get a kiss. There would be no more pretending. \u201cI want you to want to do this. Because I...I want you inside of me, becoming part of me, more than I want another tomorrow. I want to be your woman, now and always.\u201d</p> <p>Before he could respond, another pain slicked through her, raining like poisoned hail and curling her into a ball. Another crack had just slithered through the wall; she saw it in her mind.</p><p>\u201cGeryon?\u201d she panted. \u201cYou must decide.\u201d</p><p>His gaze bore into her. \u201cI once swore that were I ever lucky enough to regain my soul, I would never, for any reason, trade it again. I have just realized that I would willingly trade it for you, Kadence. So yes, I want to do this. Now we can kiss.\u201d</p><p>AS THEIR MOUTHS WORKED hungrily, Geryon slowly divested Kadence of her robe, careful not to hurt her with his razor-sharp nails. She was already in pain and he doubted she could bear much more. Beautiful, precious woman. She deserved only pleasure.</p><p>For whatever reason, she desired him. Desired forever. Together. She had given him the thing he\u2019d thought he valued most\u2014his soul\u2014but he had not known until he\u2019d watched her curl into a ball that he valued her more. Far more. He\u2019d longed to take her pain into himself. For her, anything. She cared not that he was a beast. She saw to the heart of him, and liked it.</p> <p>Amazing.</p><p>When she was naked, he pulled back and drank her in. Alabaster skin dusted with the sweetest hint of rose. Lush breasts, a curved waist, a navel his mouth watered to sample. Legs that stretched for miles. He bent and licked one of her nipples, laving his tongue around the delectable tip, his hands traveling all over her body.</p><p>The closer his fingers came to her core, the more she purred a deep sigh of satisfaction, her pain seeming to melt away. \u201cThe pleasure, it\u2019s replacing the pain,\u201d she said, confirming his thoughts.</p><p>Thank the gods. He moved his attention to her other nipple, sucking, allowing the tip of a fang to graze it ever so gently. She moaned.</p><p>\u201cStill helping?\u201d All the while his fingers teased just above her clitoris, not touching, only teasing. Was he doing this right? Please, gods, let him be doing this right.</p><p>\u201cStill helping. But I want to see you,\u201d she said, giving his armor a pointed stare.</p> <p>He lifted his head and peered into her eyes. \u201cAre you sure? I could take you without removing a single piece of armor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want all of you, Geryon.\u201d Her features were luminescent. \u201cAll.\u201d</p><p>Beautiful, precious woman, he thought again. \u201cWhatever you desire, you shall have.\u201d He only hoped she did not change her mind when she saw him.</p><p>\u201cDo not fear my reaction. You are beautiful to me.\u201d</p><p>Such sweet words. But...he\u2019d lived with his insecurities so long, they were a part of him. \u201cHow can I be? Look at me. I am a beast. A monster. Something to be feared and reviled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am looking at you and you are something to be praised. You may not bear the appearance of other men, but you have strength and courage. Besides,\u201d she added, licking her lips, \u201canimal magnetism is a very good thing. Now, show your future bride what she wants to see.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>GERYON REMOVED HIS BREAST cloth and tossed it aside, his too-corded chest with its scars, fur and over-large bones revealed. His hands shook as he then unwound the leather wrapped around his waist, as well as the rounded piece of armor, slowly revealing his hardened shaft, his scarred and fur-lined thighs.</p> <p>He tensed, waiting for the inevitable gasp of horror, even though Kadence had assured him of his \u201canimal magnetism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d she said reverently. \u201cA true warrior. My warrior.\u201d She reached up and ran her fingertips through that fur. \u201cSoft. I like. No. I love.\u201d</p><p>Breath seeped from his parted lips, breath he had not realized he\u2019d been holding until just then. \u201cKadence. Sweet Kadence,\u201d he rasped. She was...she was...everything. What had he ever done to deserve her? If he hadn\u2019t fallen in love with her already, he would have fallen then.</p><p>\u201cWant to taste you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>As the hottest thrum of desire he\u2019d ever experienced pounded through him, he kissed his way down her stomach, stopping only to dip his tongue inside her navel. She trembled. When he reached the apex of her thighs, he worshipped her, sipping, licking, nibbling, loving, and the trembling became writhing.</p><p>\u201cAmazing,\u201d she gasped, fisting his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t stop. Please don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>He could feel the power of her, wrapping around him, trying to drive his actions. He wasn\u2019t sure if he could have disobeyed and he didn\u2019t care. He wanted to devour her, possess her, and he did.</p><p>Only when she came apart, screaming her pleasure, did he rise above her. He was proud and honored to have given her such ecstasy. But he was trembling now himself, his body on fire. Desperate. Aching. For her, only her.</p><p>\u201cPain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone.\u201d</p><p>The fact that this bonding could save her might be the reason he\u2019d dared broach the subject, but he had never been happier. She would be his. She would live.</p><p>Her legs wound around him, and she cupped his cheeks, staring deep into his eyes. \u201cPlease don\u2019t change your mind. I need more of you.\u201d</p><p>He had stilled, he realized, poised at her entrance. \u201cNever change my mind. Must have you. Ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>He entered her an inch, one blessed inch. Stopped, gave her time to adjust. He\u2019d go slowly if it killed him. And it might. Torture. The sweetest kind of torture. But he would make this good for her, the best.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I not feel the need to master you?\u201d she purred into his ear. She bit the lobe.</p><p>Sweet fire. \u201cThat\u2019s how it was, before?\u201d Sweat beaded all over him and dripped onto her.</p><p>She nodded, arching her hips to take more of him. Another inch.</p><p>He had to cut off a groan. \u201cPerhaps because my heart is so completely yours, there\u2019s nothing left to master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Geryon. Please.\u201d She stroked his horns, circling a fingertip over the hard points. \u201cTake me all the way. Give me everything.\u201d</p><p>He could deny her nothing.</p><p>Releasing his fierce grip on control, he pounded forward and she cried out. Not in pain, but in joy, he realized. Their souls\u2014he had a soul, he truly had a soul\u2014were dancing together, intertwining...joining. Yes. Yes. Over and over he filled her, giving her all of him. Their wills intermingled so completely, it was impossible to tell who wanted what. Pleasure was the only goal.</p><p>His nails raked the floor beside her head, his teeth even nipped her, but she loved it all, urging him on, still begging for more. And when he spilled his seed inside her, her inner walls clutching him in her own surge of satisfaction, he shouted the words that had been building inside of him since the moment he\u2019d met her. \u201cI love you!\u201d</p><p>To his surprise, she gave a shout of her own. \u201cOh, Geryon. I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>They were mated.</p><p>They were bound.</p><p>THEY QUICKLY DRESSED. Kadence was still weak, but at least the pain had stopped.</p><p>\u201cAre they still at the gate?\u201d Geryon asked. He was ready to end this. To take her away from this realm and cherish her always.</p><p>What if she still could not leave?</p><p>The thought drifted through his head but he ignored it. He would finally have a happy ending. Because they were together. Because they loved.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re working it feverishly.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her lips, and he reveled in another taste of this woman he loved. \u201cWe will hike there. The moment you spy them, lock them in place, and I will do the rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope this works,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of being parted from you.\u201d</p><p>Neither could he. \u201cIt will. It has to.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>THE HIKE TOOK AN HOUR, a slow torturous hour as well as a too-quick span, and then Geryon found himself standing a few yards from the wall. When he comprehended the carnage around him, he couldn\u2019t quite believe his eyes. The demons had worked so fervently, they had bled all over the stones\u2014stones that had been shredded, almost paper thin. A hole was imminent.</p><p>Worse, the horde of Demon Lords was still there. They were huge, all of them at least seven foot, their bodies so broad that even Geryon, massive as he was, would not be able to stretch his arms wide enough to measure them. Skeletons were visible underneath the translucent skin. A few had wings, a few scales, and all were grotesque in their evil. Red eyes, horns like Geryon and fingers like knives.</p><p>\u201cKadence,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, Geryon, I swear I am.\u201d Each word was softer, weaker. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>One of the...things spotted them. Laughed, a sound that raised every hair on his body.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d he shouted to Kadence. Please.</p><p>\u201cFreeze, demons. I demand that you freeze.\u201d</p><p>They did not.</p><p>\u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm.\u201d She glared over at them\u2014nothing. Pointed her hands at them\u2014nothing. Groaned with the force of her will\u2014but still nothing happened. The Lords did not freeze in place. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she gasped out.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He glanced at her, even as he moved in front of her, repositioning his arm around her waist. She had paled, as she had while working in the bar, and her trembling had returned. Had his arm not been around her, he knew she would have fallen. Had the bonding not worked, then? \u201cTalk to me, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>He watched the demons as they rallied together, watching him. Laughing. Imagining how they would kill him?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m bound to you and the wall. I can feel your strength, its weakness, and it\u2019s tearing me apart,\u201d she cried. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. So sorry. All of this was for nothing, Geryon. Nothing! I\u2019m doomed. I was doomed all along.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot nothing, never nothing. We have each other.\u201d But for how long? \u201cI won\u2019t let you die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing can be done.\u201d</p><p>Slowly the demons stalked forward, predators locked on prey. Eerie delight radiated from them. \u201cI\u2019ll kill them all. We\u2019ll run. We\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are the best thing that ever happened to me,\u201d she said weakly, leaning her cheek against his back.</p><p>\u201cI forbade you to talk like that, Kadence.\u201d To say goodbye. For that\u2019s what she was doing, he knew it was.</p><p>\u201cKill them and run, just as you planned. Live in peace and freedom, my love. Both are yours. You deserve them.\u201d</p><p>No. No! \u201cYou will not die.\u201d But even as he said it, the wall, so badly damaged, began to crack, to crumble, the hole appearing. Widening. \u201cSwear to me that you will not die.\u201d</p><p>Kadence\u2019s knees finally gave out, and he turned, roaring, easing her to the ground. Her eyes were closed. \u201cSo...sorry. Love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. You will live. Do you hear me? You will live!\u201d</p><p>Her head lolled to the side. Then, nothing.</p><p>\u201cKadence.\u201d He shook her. \u201cKadence!\u201d</p><p>No response. But there was a rising and falling of her chest. She lived still. Thank gods, thank gods, thank gods.</p><p>\u201cTell me how to help you, Kadence. Please.\u201d</p><p>Again, nothing.</p> <p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Tears burned his eyes. He had not cried for the wife that left him, had not cried for the life he\u2019d lost, but he cried for this woman. I need you. She wanted him to stop the demons from leaving this realm, and then leave himself, but Geryon couldn\u2019t bring himself to move from her side.</p><p>Without her, he had no reason to go on.</p><p>Something sharp scraped at his neck, and he jerked his head to the side. The Lords flew around them, cackling with glee. \u201cLeave us,\u201d he growled. He would spend however long was necessary, holding her until it was safe enough to move her.</p><p>\u201cKill her,\u201d one demon beseeched.</p><p>\u201cDestroy her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaim her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late. She\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>More laughter.</p> <p>Bastards! One of them swooped down and raked a claw over her cheek, drawing blood before Geryon realized what was happening. She did not react. But he did. He roared with so much fury, the sound scraped at his ears.</p><p>The rest of the demons scented the lifeblood and purred in delight. Then there was a moment of absolute stillness and quiet. The calm before the storm. For, in the next instant, they attacked in a frenzy.</p><p>Geryon roared again, throwing himself over Kadence to take the brunt of their assault. Soon his back was in tatters, one of his horns chewed loose, a tendon severed. All the while he swung out his arm, hoping to slay as many as he could with his poison, but only one failed to dodge his blow.</p><p>On and on the laughter and abuse continued.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d Kadence suddenly whispered in his ear. \u201cYour scream...pulled me from...darkness. Had to...tell you.\u201d</p><p>She had awakened? His muscles spasmed in shock and relief. \u201cI love you. Stay with me. Don\u2019t leave me. Please. If you stay awake, just long enough to defend yourself, I can kill them. We can leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m...sorry. Can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Then he would find a way to save her and continue protecting her. He never would have brought her into Hell had he known this would happen. He would have spent his entire existence at the gate, fighting to protect it. Her.</p><p>Wait. Fighting to protect. These demons wanted to escape. That\u2019s why they were here.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he screamed to them. \u201cLeave this place. The mortal realm is yours.\u201d He didn\u2019t care anymore. Only Kadence mattered.</p><p>As if the wall had merely been waiting for his permission, it finally toppled completely. Which meant\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he screamed. \u201cI did not mean for you to collapse. I only meant for the demons to fly through.\u201d But it was too late, the damage was done.</p><p>Gleeful, the Demon Lords abandoned him and flew into the cave, then disappeared from view.</p><p>A new stream of tears burned Geryon\u2019s eyes as he gathered Kadence in his bleeding arms. \u201cTell me the wall no longer matters. Tell me I can now carry you to safety. That we can be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, my love,\u201d she said, and died in his arms.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>SHE WAS DEAD. KADENCE was dead. And there was nothing he could do to save her. He knew it as surely as he knew he would take his next breath. An unwanted, hated breath. Those stinging tears slid down his cheeks, mocking reminders that he lived\u2014and she did not.</p><p>I failed her. Damn this, I failed her!</p><p>She had wanted his help to save the wall, to save her. She had wanted his help to keep the Demon Lords inside Hell, yet he had failed her on all counts. Failed, failed, failed.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry, Geryon.\u201d</p><p>At this newest sound of her voice, he blinked. What the\u2014as he watched, her spirit began to rise from her motionless body. She was...she was... Hope fluttered inside his chest. Hope and joy and shock.</p><p>He had not truly lost her, after all!</p><p>Her body was destroyed, but her spirit would live on. Of course. He should have known. Every day he encountered such spirits, though none had been as pure and vibrant as hers. They could still be together.</p><p>He pushed to his feet, facing her, heart drumming madly, legs shaking. She smiled sadly at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI should not have bound myself to you. Should never have asked for your aid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d When he\u2019d never been happier? She was here, with him. \u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for, sweetheart. It is I who failed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever say such a thing. Had you been stationed at the gate as you had wanted, this would not have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t so. The demons would have ruined the wall, and thereby ruined you, but I would not have had the opportunity, no, the pleasure, of bonding with you. I cannot regret what happened.\u201d Not anymore. Not with her spirit just in front of him.</p><p>\u201cGeryon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of the demons?\u201d he asked, cutting her off. He would not have her lamenting her supposed mistakes. She had made none.</p><p>\u201cI suppose the gods will attempt to gather them, bemoaning me as a failure forevermore.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou are not a failure, love. You did everything within your power to stop them. Most would never even have entered the gates.\u201d His head tilted to the side as he studied her more intently. She was as lovely as ever, like a dream of her former self. Glittery, translucent, fragile. Still she possessed those golden curls. Still she looked at him with those bright eyes.</p><p>Before her, his life had been a wasteland. A single moment without her would have been...well, hell.</p><p>\u201cThank you, my sweet Geryon. But even if the wall is repaired, even if the demons are somehow captured, I fear the gods will be unable to contain those demons here.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThey have now tasted freedom. They will always fight to escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gods will find a way,\u201d he assured her. \u201cThey always do.\u201d He reached out to hug her to him, but his hand misted through her and he frowned, some of his happiness draining. Touching her was a necessity; he would not be able to live without her warmth, her softness.</p><p>Better he do without her touch and her warmth, though, than without her.</p><p>\u201cYou understand now,\u201d she said in that sad tone. \u201cWe can never be together again. Not truly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do.\u201d Tears filled her eyes. \u201cAfter everything you have suffered, you deserve more. So much more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only want you.\u201d</p><p>She continued as if he had not spoken. \u201cI will leave you and wander the earth alone.\u201d She gave a firm shake of her head. Those tears splashed onto her cheeks. \u201cI know gods and goddesses are allowed to choose where they wish to reside in the afterlife, but I have no desire to return to heaven or stay in Hell.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, an idea sprang into his mind. A wild idea he did not discard, but rather embraced.</p><p>Are you really going to do this?</p><p>He looked at her again, their gazes colliding and thought, Yes. I really am going to do this. \u201cWhen I bonded to you, Kadence, it was forever and another eternity. I will not give you up now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will never again be able to touch me. You will never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. I promise.\u201d And with that, he sank his own poisoned claws into his chest, felt the toxin burn him, blistering, scorching. He screamed at the anguish, black winking over his eyes.</p><p>He was...dying...</p><p>When the pain eased, the blackness faded. He was nothing. A void.</p><p>No, not true. There was a light. A bright light. He ran toward it, huffing and puffing for mile after mile, almost...there...</p><p>His eyelids fluttered open and he saw that his body was gone, a pile of ash, his spirit floating beside Kadence. Her eyes were wide, her mouth hanging open.</p><p>So many times over the centuries, he\u2019d considered taking just such an action. Anything to end the monotony of his existence. But he had clung to life, for Kadence. To see her, to imagine caressing her and hope for the chance.</p><p>Now, that chance was a reality.</p><p>\u201cYou are...Geryon...you are just the same.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at himself. There were his claws, his fur, his hooves. \u201cAre you disappointed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I am overjoyed! I love you just as you are and do not want you to ever change. But you should not have given up your life for me,\u201d she sputtered through tears\u2014and a grin she could not hide.</p><p>\u201cI, too, am now free,\u201d he said. \u201cTruly free. To be with you. And I would die all over again for just such an outcome.\u201d He jerked her into his arms, grinning, too, because he could feel her again. She was not as warm, there was a coldness to them both now, but he was holding her. He could deal. \u201cYou are my everything, sweetheart. I am lost without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d she said, raining little kisses all over his face. \u201cBut whatever will we do now?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLive. Finally, we will live.\u201d</p><p>And they did.</p><p>WHEN THE GODS REALIZED that the wall between earth and Hell had been breeched and a horde of Demon Lords let loose upon earth, they sent an immortal army to repair the damage\u2014but no one could catch the fiends. And even if they could, the gods knew that locking them back inside Hell would merely invite another rebellion.</p> <p>Something had to be done.</p><p>Though the stone barrier had fallen, the goddess of Oppression\u2019s body was still bound to the wall of Hell. And so the gods rebuilt the wall and then created a box-sized prison from Kadence\u2019s bones, confident that the powers she had tapped into hours before her death still resided deep in the marrow.</p><p>They were proven right.</p><p>Once opened, the box drew the demons from their hiding places, holding them captive as even Hell had been unable to do.</p><p>Of course, the gods were pleased with their handiwork and gave the box to Pandora, the strongest female warrior of her time, to guard. But that is a story for another time.</p> <p>THE AMAZON\u2019S CURSE</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>NOLA STOOD IN THE CENTER of the battle tent, watching as her sisters-by-race lined up. Each shifted eagerly from one foot to the other, clutching their weapon of choice. She spotted several axes, a few spears, but mostly swords. Anticipation thickened the air.</p><p>Mating season had officially begun.</p><p>Soon the females would break into groups, fighting each other for the right to whichever stolen slave they desired. Those slaves, eight in number, were currently chained to the far wall at the end of the spacious enclosure. Three dragon shifters, two centaurs, two male sirens and a vampire. All eight were muscled, beautiful...and all but one was grinning. The vampire.</p><p>Her vampire. Zane.</p> <p>The men would be bedded this night and for several weeks to come. Then they would be freed, never to return. That was the way of the Amazons. Capture, breed and abandon. Of course the males were happy about this. All but Zane. His fury was palpable.</p><p>Despite that fury, her gaze drank him in. Zane had dark hair, equally dark eyes and a body made for war. And sex. He had muscle stacked upon muscle and scars that laced his corded chest.</p><p>He also had the fiercest temper she\u2019d ever encountered. He didn\u2019t like to be touched and had actually injured many Amazons\u2014not an easy feat\u2014in his quest for freedom. Finally, in an effort to tame him, they had stopped feeding him the blood he needed for strength. Now he was physically weakened, only able to lean against the wall and wait for his mistress to be declared.</p><p>However, nothing could weaken his hatred\u2014or the promised retribution that radiated from him.</p><p>Nola had met him what seemed an eternity but had actually only been four months ago. He\u2019d desired her, for whatever reason, and had tried to win her affections\u2014and she\u2019d tried to kill him.</p><p>With the memory, guilt filled her. But in her defense, she hadn\u2019t known him then. Had only been concerned with her own survival. The gods had swept them to a remote island, along with several other creatures, and pitted them against each other, forcing them to fight. Worse, forcing them to watch helplessly as their friends were executed.</p><p>More than that, she\u2019d spent her entire life hating men and the pain they brought with them. As a young child, she\u2019d been sold by her own mother to male after male; she\u2019d been used, hurt, taunted...ruined. Zane\u2019s desire had frightened her, and she had lashed out.</p><p>And now, she was paying for that.</p> <p>No one could see her. No one could hear her. Though she was encircled by the bright, golden light seeping through the tent\u2019s apex, no one knew she was there, that she\u2019d been among them, month after month. The gods had cursed her with invisibility when she\u2019d been eliminated from their impossible contest\u2014and then chained her to this camp as surely as Zane was now chained.</p><p>The gods had seen to Zane\u2019s captivity, as well, gifting the vampire to the Amazons to use as they saw fit. And use him they would\u2014and had already. Because mating season had not begun until today, they had forced him to work their land, hauling boulder after boulder for the building of more tents. He\u2019d had to find sticks and sharpen them into weapons. They\u2019d even forced him to feed many of the women by hand. Of course, he\u2019d tried to escape, time after time, so they\u2019d resorted to starving him. That starvation had caused him to weaken unbearably, rendering him useless. Lately all he\u2019d been able to do was lie in place and curse.</p><p>She hated seeing him like this. Maybe because she no longer viewed him as an enemy. How could she? He suffered as she suffered. But now, they would never have a chance to explore their...feelings for each other. Yes, feelings, she thought. On her part anyway. Finally, she felt. A need to protect. A need to defend.</p><p>Yet she could do neither. And after the way she had treated him, rejecting his advances, he might not want her to try.</p><p>What did he see in me, anyway? She\u2019d never understood. That dislike of another\u2019s touch...he\u2019d possessed it even on the island. Even with his own king, Layel. Except with her.</p><p>Her, he had welcomed. Again, why? What made her so different?</p><p>And why had she not reveled in him while she\u2019d had the chance?</p><p>Foolish girl. That\u2019s what her mother had called her every time she\u2019d complained about her abuse. Nola had never agreed. Until now.</p><p>\u201cIt is time,\u201d a commanding female voice suddenly boomed. \u201cStand before the slave you wish to claim.\u201d</p><p>A royal decree the warrioresses rushed to obey, breaking apart, rushing forward.</p><p>Kreja, the Amazon queen, stood at the edge of her royal dais, her gaze scanning, expectant. She was a lovely woman, with pale hair and light eyes, both of which gave her the appearance of fragility. But she possessed an iron core, a vicious nature. Which was why Nola had always served her well. She cherished order and had truly enjoyed being led by a woman who thought battles were to be won at any cost.</p><p>Now? Not so much.</p><p>Finally, the women were crowded around the males that tempted them.</p><p>Nineteen of the thirty-two females chose Zane.</p><p>Shocking. She had thought their aversion to biting and blood would deter them. She should have known better. Strength was prized among the Amazons, and Zane had nearly won his freedom. Twice. They wanted that strength for their offspring, which was the entire point of mating season.</p><p>Her hands curled into fists. Fists that would remain useless, for they could make contact with no one but herself.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Kreja said with a grin. She nodded to the ones standing in front of Zane. \u201cYou have chosen well. Though the vampire is a parasite, his daughters will be stalwart.\u201d</p><p>His daughters.</p><p>They should have been mine. Amazons only gave birth to girls. Nola didn\u2019t know why or how, only that it was so. And she wanted to kill anyone who would accept this man\u2019s seed.</p><p>\u201cAnd if our goddess is shining upon us,\u201d Kreja continued, \u201cwe will be able to train those daughters to consume something besides blood. If not...\u201d She shrugged, but Nola knew what she implied.</p><p>The daughters would be killed.</p><p>Zane snarled.</p><p>That delighted the women around him, edging them to a new level of eagerness.</p><p>Nola fought a wave of anger, of helplessness. He knows what Kreja plans, and does not like it. He wants to protect his children, even though none have yet been conceived. No, she should not have feared Zane. She should have enjoyed him, maybe run away with him.</p><p>Like him, she did not like being touched. Except by him. His was the first touch in the entire span of her life that had not filled her with disgust. There had been something almost...reverent in his every gentle caress. If she\u2019d welcomed him, he might have helped purge the demons of her past. He might have saved her from herself.</p><p>Now, she would never know.</p><p>Just as she\u2019d wondered what made her so different to him, she wondered what made him so different to her. That they were so alike? That they sensed, on a bone-deep level, the other\u2019s hurt? Because yes, every time she neared him, her heart squeezed and shuddered. Pain always rested in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cFight for me if you wish,\u201d he said through sharp, gritted teeth, drawing her thoughts back to the tent, \u201cbut know that I will slay the winner with my bare hands.\u201d</p><p>He was not a man given to boasting, Nola knew. He promised\u2014and he followed through.</p><p>\u201cSo vengeful,\u201d someone twittered happily.</p><p>\u201cSo mine,\u201d another snapped.</p><p>\u201cIt is I who will win his seed,\u201d still another growled. \u201cI who will give birth to his offspring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will bear my child,\u201d he roared. \u201cI will die first.\u201d</p><p>He could not die!</p><p>He is not meant to be a slave, Nola longed to shout. He was too proud, too defiant. Traits she also possessed. Which was why she had finally risen up and slain her own mother. Which in turn was why she sometimes cried herself to sleep, wishing she could claw the bloody images from her mind.</p><p>Scowling, Nola strode forward and reached out, hoping that, for once, her fingers would do more than ghost through as she tried to shove the Amazons aside. As always, her hand slipped through their bodies as if she were nothing more substantial than mist.</p><p>A cry of frustration escaped her.</p><p>Still, no one paid her any heed.</p><p>\u201cThose of you who desire the vampire will now enter the arena.\u201d Kreja\u2019s hard voice silenced their arguments. Together they did as commanded, bypassing Nola, even stepping through her. \u201cHe shall be the first prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d she shouted. \u201cHear me!\u201d</p><p>Of course, they did not.</p><p>Shoulders slumping, she closed the distance between herself and Zane and sank beside him. Like the others, he did not act as if he noticed. But she could almost\u2014almost\u2014feel his warmth, and goose bumps broke out over her skin.</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d Kreja called with a wave of her hand.</p><p>Lily, the child-princess who would one day rule this clan, stood from her throne atop the dais and walked to her mother\u2019s side, her little body draped in velvet robes rather than the leather straps and skirts worn by the warrioresses.</p><p>She had changed much in the past few months. No longer was this queen-in-training giddy and innocent. Once having run from camp to prove herself worthy of her people\u2014thereby inadvertently beginning a war between the Amazons and the dragons, a war she\u2019d once thought had caused the deaths of Nola and another Amazon, Delilah\u2014she was now solemn. She\u2019d even relinquished her right to claim Brand the dragon shifter, another of the gods\u2019 exiles, as her personal servant, and had offered him up to her people. He now sat among the other slaves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou will not fight to the death,\u201d Lily proclaimed in her soft voice. \u201cBut you will continue to engage each other until only one of you is left standing. It is she who will earn the right to bed the vampire.\u201d</p><p>And when that winner tired of him, she could pass him on to her friends if she so chose. Increasing Zane\u2019s humiliation.</p><p>Mating season had never bothered Nola before, but it bothered her now.</p> <p>Leave. After Nola\u2019s own experience with the gods\u2019 cruel contest, she had no desire to watch another. For Zane, however, she would watch. And she would wish.</p><p>Every female in the ring assumed the battle stance.</p><p>There was only a slight pause before Kreja said, \u201cYou may begin.\u201d</p><p>Immediately the women leapt into action. Metal clanged against metal, grunts abounded, and sand was flung in every direction. Seconds bled into minutes. Minutes to what seemed hours. An eternity. Bodies began collapsing, cries of pain echoing, one pink-haired female savagely working her way through the masses.</p><p>Soon, she was the only one standing.</p> <p>Over. Done.</p><p>Nola wanted to vomit.</p><p>\u201cAnd so we have a winner,\u201d Kreja decreed proudly. She motioned to Zane with a wave of her hand. \u201cClaim your prize, beloved. Know that we are pleased with the strength and tenacity you have demonstrated this day.\u201d</p><p>As the female approached, Zane trembled. In rage. Perhaps in fear.</p><p>I\u2019m so sorry, vampire. \u201cI won\u2019t let her have you,\u201d Nola vowed, though she knew there was nothing she could do to stop what was to come.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p> <p>THE FEMALE WAS GOING TO KILL HIM, Zane thought dazedly, dispassionately.</p><p>She\u2019d won him, however long ago she\u2019d fought for him\u2014one day? Two? Weak as he was, he\u2019d lost track of time. All he knew was that she\u2019d tried multiple times to bed him. But she needed a hard cock for that, and he hadn\u2019t given it to her.</p><p>Denying her had delighted him. Still did.</p><p>Now two of those wretched Amazons stood around him, staring down at his naked body. If he hadn\u2019t been half-starved and teetering on the brink of total collapse, those stares would have sent him into a killing rage. He hated being looked at as much as he hated being touched.</p><p>He\u2019d spent too many centuries as the demon queen\u2019s whore, hers to use, hers to hurt. And hurt him she had.</p><p>Many times, she\u2019d forced him to drop to his knees and \u201cworship\u201d her with his mouth. Many times, she had forced him to clean each and every one of the horns covering her body. Again, with his mouth. Many times, she had forced him to do the same to others while she watched.</p><p>But the worst... He shuddered, hating to remember. But just then, his memories were all he had. They filled him up, consumed him, eating him bite by rancid bite. She\u2019d blindfolded him and bound him to her bed. He had not known who kissed and touched him. Male, female. Demon, another slave. He hadn\u2019t known.</p><p>He hated, hated that there were people in Atlantis who knew of his humiliation and subjugation. He hated that those people had seen him naked, tasted him, brought him to climax in terrible ways, yet he did not know who they were.</p> <p>Bile rose from his stomach into his throat. Demon whore. That\u2019s what he was, all he would ever be. Demon whore, demon whore. He squeezed his eyes shut. He wanted to cover his ears, but could not. His arms were tied, true, but even if he had been free, he was too weak to move.</p><p>Demon whore.</p><p>How could he have allowed such things? And he had. Allowed them. He could have walked away at any time. Yet he hadn\u2019t.</p><p>All for the love of a woman. A slave, as he was supposed to be now. Marina, that detestable queen, had promised to set his beloved free if Zane pleased her until she grew tired of him. But she\u2019d never grown tired of him, and Cassandra, his chosen mate, had begun to hate him as a result. For all he knew, she could have been forced to watch him with the queen.</p><p>Demon whore.</p><p>Yet still he\u2019d stayed, determined to finally win his prize. His Cassandra. If he couldn\u2019t have her as a mate, he\u2019d at least wanted her to be happy. And as he well knew, no one could be happy without freedom.</p><p>But then, his actions hadn\u2019t mattered. Layel, the vampire king, had done the impossible\u2014what Zane had craved but had not yet had the strength to do\u2014and drained the demon queen, finally freeing both Zane and Cassandra. He\u2019d thought to earn back her love. However necessary. After all, everything he had done had been for her. Every hated touch, every blinded session. Only, she\u2019d fled him. For another man.</p><p>Demon whore.</p><p>Perhaps that had been for the best.</p><p>Zane was not the man he\u2019d once been. He eschewed females and wanted no part of them. Wanted no part of sex. He shuddered at even the thought of it, and sickness once again churned in his stomach. Had he eaten that day, he would have vomited.</p><p>One bright light. Remember your one bright light.</p><p>Nola.</p><p>Finally, his stomach calmed.</p><p>Nola had walked into his life, chasing away the darkness. Beautiful, passionate, fierce Nola. A woman who hadn\u2019t wanted him, who had rebuffed him. A woman he\u2019d craved with every ounce of his being despite what had been done to him. A woman the gods had taken from him. Why did he want her so damned passionately? He hadn\u2019t known then, and he didn\u2019t know now. Yet still he craved her. As if she were necessary to him. To his survival. As if, the first moment their eyes had met, hers as haunted as he knew his were, she had become a part of him.</p><p>Would he ever see her again?</p><p>He did not know if she\u2019d survived their island game or if the gods had set her free, but sometimes he would swear that he smelled her sweet scent, felt the gentle glide of her hands on him. A touch he still did not mind.</p><p>A touch he needed. She...soothed him.</p><p>And, actually, the first time he\u2019d seen her, he\u2019d thought her a gift from the gods. For why else would he have been able to endure\u2014no, enjoy\u2014her touch and no other\u2019s? Now, he thought that perhaps she\u2019d been another curse. He craved her still, yet like Cassandra he could never have her.</p><p>What did I do to deserve this?</p><p>Demon whore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m strong,\u201d his owner said now, drawing his attention, \u201cso of course he desires me. I mean, look at what I did to my competitors! Eighteen against one, yet I owned that arena. But he\u2019s too weak to be claimed. That\u2019s the problem here. Surely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Clearly he needs blood,\u201d another said.</p><p>\u201cYes, but if he\u2019s given blood, he\u2019ll be able to raise his head and bite me.\u201d</p><p>Both of the females shuddered.</p><p>Did these Amazons\u2014who abhorred the biting of flesh and the drinking of blood and who thought to rape him to steal a child from him\u2014not realize the child of a vampire would not be trainable, as the Amazon queen had said? A vampire needed blood. Blood was nourishment. Life. That was not something that could be \u201ctrained\u201d away.</p><p>And so, any child of his would be killed. That\u2019s what the foolish queen had implied.</p><p>His baby. Killed. Even through the haze of weakness, rage sparked inside his chest. He would kill them first, he thought, once again struggling against his bonds.</p><p>They expected him to leave his child behind, to be raised by them. Abused by them. Something he would never do. What was his, was his. He did not share. He did not abandon.</p><p>\u201cWeak, but still fighting,\u201d the pink-haired Amazon said with awe.</p><p>\u201cYet still no hardened shaft,\u201d the other tsked.</p><p>Calm. Or they will stop feeding you altogether. Though every bone in his body screamed for him to do otherwise, he relaxed against his pallet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to feed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But even now, I think he would bite me if I got too close. What is to happen when he\u2019s stronger?\u201d</p><p>Before his last escape attempt, they\u2019d kept him nourished by allowing him three small cups of blood a day. Who had donated the blood, he didn\u2019t know. Didn\u2019t care. He didn\u2019t like to take from a living source, only from those he\u2019d slain. So he\u2019d pretended the blood came from one of his victims.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s think this through, then. Perhaps there is another way. Did you try manipulating his rod?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. He\u2019s not my first slave, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, give him blood, then...bind his mouth. Yes, that might work. That way, he\u2019ll be strong enough to bed but unable to nibble on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, excellent idea! Grab a goblet.\u201d The pink-haired woman\u2014he hadn\u2019t cared to remember her name\u2014palmed one of her daggers, sliced a groove in her wrist and held the wound over the offered cup.</p><p>His mouth watered at the sight and smell of that crimson nectar; his fangs elongated. She was not dead, he couldn\u2019t pretend otherwise, but he would still take from her. Sacrifices must be made in times of adversity.</p><p>She approached him and held the cup to his lips. Thankfully, her skin did not brush his. \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>As though in a trance, he obeyed, swallowing three precious mouthfuls. Instantly, warmth spread through him, followed on its heels by strength. So good...</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s working. His color is returning.\u201d The goblet was removed from his mouth, and he found his gaze locked with that of his captor. She was pretty, if he cared for such things. He didn\u2019t. He only cared that she had pink hair rather than black, brown eyes rather than turquoise, and she did not smell like Nola. Like sea and storms and flowers.</p><p>There was a pause, then a purr of agreement. \u201cHe\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget he\u2019s mine,\u201d was the snapped reply.</p><p>\u201cWell, his cock is still flaccid, so you won\u2019t be claiming him any time soon,\u201d the other Amazon lashed back.</p><p>As the blood continued to work through him, the lethargy that had plagued him all these many days dissolved, leaving energy in his muscles, a sizzle in his bones. Escape, he thought, a growl working its way past his throat.</p><p>Both Amazons jumped away from him with a yelp.</p><p>\u201cHurry! Let\u2019s bind his mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d Growls intensifying, Zane jerked at the chains circling his wrists and ankles. He hissed and snapped, kicking as much as he was able as the Amazons maneuvered around him. \u201cNo touching! Do you hear me? I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Metal cut past his flesh, hitting those sizzling bones. Still he fought, imagining his blade slicing through both of these women. More blood would spill. He would lap it up. Strengthen even more. He would tear through their camp. No mercy.</p><p>Suddenly a golden ray of light spilled inside the tent, and he would have sworn he caught a glimpse of...no, surely not. Couldn\u2019t be. Yet...there she was. His Nola.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014\u201d He stilled, his heart slamming against his ribs. Couldn\u2019t be, he thought again. Unless...was she a hallucination? He\u2019d had them before, yet they never ceased to shock him.</p> <p>His captor moved, reaching for his neck, blocking the vision.</p><p>\u201cOut of my way!\u201d he shouted, bumping his hip against hers and sending her toppling to her face. He\u2019d imagined Nola before, there in the battle tent. Sadly, that glimpse had lasted only a few heart-stopping seconds. How long would this one last?</p><p>Had his captor already dispelled it?</p><p>If she had...</p><p>No. There Nola was again, a shimmering outline of long black hair, a glow of turquoise eyes. She was trying\u2014ineffectually\u2014to tug his captor away from him. He lost his breath. So lovely. His shaft hardened quickly and painfully. Nola. His sweetest tormentor.</p> <p>Then the vision wavered, the air dabbled...gone. She was gone.</p><p>He wanted to scream and hurt and maim. To kill and be killed. The desire came too late, though, his stunned immobility costing him. The Amazon was able to leap to her feet and easily hook a thick strap of material around his useless mouth.</p><p>\u201cFinally.\u201d Sighing with satisfaction, she leaned away from him, crouching on her haunches and smiling smugly. \u201cAnd just as I suspected, your rod is\u2014\u201d Her words halted and her smile faded as his cock withered before her eyes. \u201cBut...you were...why...\u201d</p><p>He had only imagined Nola; he knew that, but he couldn\u2019t stop his gaze from searching for another glimpse of her. To his dismay, he saw only furs, carved furniture and weapons.</p><p>Even as his captor and her friend attempted to arouse him once more, stripping for him, caressing him, he did not stop searching.</p><p>Finally, exasperated with him, the Amazons dressed and stormed from the tent, leaving him alone with his insanity.</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>AS MANY TIMES AS NOLA had been chained and used in her life, she knew the humiliation, frustration and helplessness Zane was now feeling. He must want to kill Amelia, his new owner. She did.</p><p>Hurting another Amazon went against every instinct Nola possessed, every rule she\u2019d ever been taught\u2014after she\u2019d escaped her mother, that is\u2014but she would have sliced the warrioress to pieces if she\u2019d been able to grip a blade. Exactly as she\u2019d done to her mother. Zane\u2019s eyes had been so wild, his snarls so desperate. And she\u2019d been unable to aid him, had only been able to watch in horror.</p><p>\u201cI will take his place,\u201d she shouted to the ceiling, not knowing if the gods were listening. Or if they even cared. But she had to try. Zane didn\u2019t deserve this. No one did. At least she had endured servitude before. She could do so again. And were she to actually take Zane\u2019s place, the women wouldn\u2019t rape her, of course, but they would work her and beat her. Neither of which would break her. Because she would know she had helped her man.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she shouted. \u201cSwitch us!\u201d</p><p>No response. But suddenly air was sucked through Zane\u2019s nostrils, and his body jerked. Then he began struggling against his bonds again. Her attention whipped to him. He was staring directly at her, his dark gaze boring into her.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d she said, rushing to his side and kneeling. \u201cShh, now. Shh. You\u2019ll only injure your wrists and ankles further.\u201d Already he was bleeding, losing the blood he\u2019d just been given.</p><p>He tracked her every movement.</p> <p>Could he...no. Not possible. No matter how many times she\u2019d wished otherwise, she\u2019d remained as unnoticeable as the air he breathed. Besides, if he knew she was here, he would be fighting her as he\u2019d fought Amelia. Perhaps even more violently. She had not only rebuked his advances, she had tried to hurt him, too. Had called him vile names he had not deserved. All because she\u2019d been too frightened of her feelings.</p><p>I am not worthy of being an Amazon warrioress.</p><p>Frantic, Zane rubbed his jaw against his shoulder until the material fell away from his mouth. \u201cNola,\u201d he rasped. \u201cNola, Nola, Nola. You are here.\u201d</p><p>He could see her. Oh, gods. Oh, gods! Could she touch him? Her arm shook as she reached out, meaning to brush his hair from his face, but as always, her hand ghosted through him. She moaned in frustration.</p><p>He laughed, the sound full of sweet satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019ve finally slipped over the edge of sanity and I don\u2019t care.\u201d He relaxed against the blankets spread out beneath him. \u201cMy Nola, here to comfort me. As beautiful as ever.\u201d</p><p>His Nola? A shiver moved through her. Oh, if only...\u201cYou aren\u2019t imagining me, Zane. I\u2019m truly here. I\u2019ve been here since the day of your arrival.\u201d</p><p>Zane didn\u2019t seem to hear her. His gaze was too busy drinking her in. \u201cOf course I would imagine you like this, soft and lush, but still not mine to possess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me. The gods cursed me, as they cursed you, only I am not to be seen, heard or felt.\u201d Until now. Why, why, why could she now be seen and heard but still not felt?</p><p>Finally, her words seemed to take root. His eyelids narrowed and his lips pulled tight against his teeth, revealing the tips of those deadly fangs. \u201cHow is that possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeed I remind you of the gods\u2019 powers?\u201d</p><p>His cheeks flushed. \u201cHow can I see you now, then?\u201d he asked, mirroring her thoughts. \u201cWhat has changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I knew,\u201d she said on a sigh. Would others be able to see her, as well?</p><p>He laughed without humor. \u201cSo. Another curse is to be heaped upon me. To see, but never to touch the only one I desire.\u201d He turned his head from her, as if he couldn\u2019t bear to look at her another second.</p><p>That was the treatment she\u2019d expected from him, but it still hurt. You deserve it. Take it like a warrior.</p><p>At least he no longer thought himself crazy.</p><p>\u201cYou...still wish to touch me?\u201d</p><p>A pause, heavy, laden with tension. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you with Brand?\u201d he demanded rather than answer her.</p><p>Brand, the dragon shape-shifter who had been cursed right alongside them. \u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d What? She liked Brand, but she wasn\u2019t concerned with his treatment. He had not fought his captivity like Zane. He had embraced the thought of a temporary Amazon owner.</p><p>Other than Lily, that is. Lily had been too young for him, and he\u2019d been nothing more than a maid for her. Since she\u2019d released him into the tender care of the other Amazons, though, he\u2019d looked nothing but content.</p><p>But even if he had not been enjoying himself, Nola still would have chosen to watch over Zane. His strength and determination, and even his wildness, drew her. Maybe because that wildness had never truly extended to her. Even when she\u2019d stabbed both of his shoulders with spears, he had not attempted to hurt her. He had cried out for her, wanting to be with her.</p><p>I hate myself for rejecting him.</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you used your...gift to help you escape?\u201d she asked, ignoring his question as he\u2019d ignored hers. Much as this man had to hate her, despite the desire he\u2019d professed\u2014or had she imagined that?\u2014she wasn\u2019t ready to voice her softer feelings. Even she didn\u2019t understand her change from tormentor to tormented. And what if he were to reject her? Her already bruised and battered heart would not survive.</p><p>His cheeks heated in embarrassment, but still he did not face her.</p><p>He\u2019d once used that gift on her. Had slipped inside her dreams and showed her how good it would be between them. How he would kiss and taste every inch of her body, enjoy her, help her enjoy him.</p><p>\u201cYou can show the Amazons the destruction you will unleash if they fail to release you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gods stripped me of the ability when they sent me here,\u201d he finally admitted. \u201cI can no longer enter dreams. Or create nightmares. They also stripped me of my ability to transport myself to other locations with only a thought.\u201d</p><p>Damn them! \u201cThere has to be a way to free you. I wish I could leave camp and visit your king. Word has spread through Atlantis that he is wed now to my sister, Delilah. They would help you, I know it. And maybe, like you, they would be able to see and hear me. But I am bound to this camp, as surely as if I were shackled. I cannot leave its boundaries.\u201d</p><p>Or perhaps she could, now that part of her curse seemed to be lifted. She wanted to check, but couldn\u2019t force herself to move away.</p><p>Zane shifted even further away from her, his chains rattling. It was another stark reminder of their doomed circumstances. \u201cWhy would you help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2014\u201d She peered down at her hands. Her fingers were twined together and twisting the leather of her skirt. They wanted to be on Zane\u2019s body, learning his every nuance. What would make him gasp in pleasure? What would make him moan? \u201cI owe you. I hurt you, and I\u2019m sorry for that. Sorrier than I can ever express. I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d he growled, cutting her off. \u201cI don\u2019t want your apology. I never did.\u201d</p><p>Rejection. Even though she had not professed her new feelings. As she\u2019d suspected, her heart stopped. Literally stopped. Tears burned her eyes. She had not cried in years. Not since she was a little girl, huddled in bed, dreading the monsters who would visit her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted you...your body,\u201d he added in a croak. \u201cStill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Shocking. Need trembled through her. Welcome need. Beloved need. \u201cYes.\u201d Yes. \u201cI would rather give myself to you than give the apology, for I want you, too.\u201d There. Admission. Not as scary as she had thought. Freeing, actually. \u201cBut you can\u2019t touch me, and I cannot touch you. How...\u201d Hated need, she thought next. A craving that could never be satisfied. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe will figure it out.\u201d Huskily said, softening expression.</p><p>How? she wanted to ask again, but didn\u2019t. No telling when Amelia would return. Their privacy was limited, and she did not want to spend it grasping for solutions they would never find.</p><p>Apparently, Zane did not either.</p> <p>\u201cClimb on top of me,\u201d he beseeched. \u201cI want to see you there. Want to imagine.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, she obeyed without hesitation, eager, straddling his waist. His eyes closed, and he arched up. Imagine, he\u2019d said. He was imagining sinking inside her.</p><p>Yes, she thought. Yes. She would like that. Wanted that. She imagined his hard shaft entering inch by inch and moaned. A few times, the act had felt pleasurable rather than painful, but those times had left her wallowing in shame. How could she have liked being bedded by those disgusting males, even for a moment?</p><p>This time, however, there was no shame. Only acceptance. More.</p><p>\u201cZane, I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFeel good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad. Would you like me to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The entrance to the tent flapped, and Amelia strode inside. \u201cWell, vampire. I have decided\u2014\u201d Her eyes widened, and she stopped. \u201cNola? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Nola jumped up as though burned. She wanted to scream in frustration, but held her tongue. One question had been answered, at least. Others could see her. \u201cHello, Amelia.\u201d Did she sound as breathless to the warrioress as she did to herself?</p><p>\u201cWe thought you were dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou thought wrong.\u201d</p><p>Amelia\u2019s dark gaze swung to Zane, then back to Nola. \u201cEither way, you will move away from my slave. If you wanted him for yourself, you should have been brave enough to return and fight for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want him for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d</p><p>No. It wasn\u2019t. She refused to believe that.</p><p>\u201cNola,\u201d Zane said, and there was a warning in his tone.</p><p>A warning of what? Nola didn\u2019t face him, but squared her shoulders and forced her expression to harden. \u201cWell, I am here now. Amelia, I challenge you for the vampire.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p> <p>\u201cHURRY! SHE\u2019LL RETURN any moment, and she\u2019ll have others with her. Perhaps the entire army.\u201d</p><p>Zane watched as Nola tried and failed to jerk the head of his chains from the iron pole they were attached to, a pole that was anchored deep in the earth. As before, her fingers merely passed through the object.</p><p>His shock had yet to diminish. Nola was here; Nola wanted him; Nola thought to help him. After her announcement\u2014I challenge you for the vampire\u2014his captor had stormed out of the tent with every intention of speaking to the Amazon queen. And having Nola imprisoned.</p><p>No. He would not allow that.</p><p>She was his.</p><p>Earlier when she\u2019d apologized to him, it had not been remorse thickening her voice. It had been desire. Then she\u2019d climbed on top of him without any uncertainty, had moaned when he\u2019d arched into her. He hadn\u2019t been able to feel her, but oh, just the thought of doing so had been enough for him. He\u2019d never craved a female more.</p><p>\u201cHow do you propose to fight her?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou cannot hurt her, and she cannot hurt you.\u201d Thank the gods. He would rather endure an eternity of slavery than watch this woman bleed.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to fight her. Well, I did, do, but know I can\u2019t. I just wanted time. And why are you just lying there?\u201d She peered down at him, hands on her hips, dark hair streaming wildly around her delicate face. \u201cFight free!\u201d</p><p>So lovely. Everything he\u2019d craved these many months of his captivity\u2014Nola, freedom, a chance to be together\u2014was now being offered to him. No longer did he feel cursed. Never had he been so blessed.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t feel her? So what. Being with her was more important.</p><p>\u201cYou will come with me? If I escape?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I can, yes. I want that more than anything,\u201d she added in a fierce whisper.</p><p>Again, there was no uncertainty. There was even a flicker of hope in her magnificent eyes. She truly did not hate him.</p><p>What had brought about this change in her?</p><p>Would she change her mind if she knew of his past?</p><p>Demon whore.</p><p>He squeezed his eyes closed, wishing once again that he could cover his ears.</p><p>\u201cZane, darling. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t tell her. Don\u2019t ever tell her. \u201cNothing.\u201d She would run from him as Cassandra had.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting,\u201d Nola said. She tapped on his chest, just above his heart. \u201cHere. Tell me why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will escape,\u201d he said instead. \u201cYou will come with me.\u201d</p><p>He was suddenly fueled with a fervor he had never experienced before. He wanted this. Would have this. Just as...soon as...he broke...free. For what seemed an eternity, he pulled hard at his wrists and ankles, straining so forcefully his bones eventually gave way.</p><p>Out came both his ankles; out came both his wrists. The pain of it nearly bowled him over as he sat up, then stood to trembling legs. He didn\u2019t care about the pain, though. He was free at last.</p><p>Together. They could be together.</p><p>\u201cI hear them,\u201d Nola gasped. \u201cCome on.\u201d She made to grab him, but her hand misted through his body. \u201cDamn this!\u201d</p><p>There was no sensation, no chill, but the knowledge that she had tried to touch him caused him to shiver rather than shudder. From the very first, it had been that way. Others he ran from. Others he abhorred. Her, he only yearned for more of. Why? he wondered again.</p><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d She raced to the far end of the tent. \u201cRaise the flap.\u201d</p><p>He lumbered to her, stumbling constantly, and did as commanded. All the while, his battered body screamed in agony, black winking over his vision, stomach threatening to heave. Vampires were fast healers, but he\u2019d been without blood too long, the few sips he\u2019d had earlier already used up.</p><p>Outside, light poured from the crystal dome surrounding all of Atlantis, heating and stinging his now-sensitive skin and making his eyes water. This kind of reaction had only happened once before. On that cursed island of the gods.</p><p>The reminder of his time there infuriated him and that fury gave him strength. He could do this. Tent after tent dotted the surrounding land. Amazons were scattered throughout. Some were bent over a fire and hammering at weapons; some were hanging animal hides.</p><p>\u201cWalk behind me,\u201d Nola said, \u201cas if you are my slave.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for his agreement, she moved forward, head held high. Behind him, he could hear a murmur of voices inside his captor\u2019s tent. Amelia had returned, and she had indeed brought an army with her. Zane kicked into motion. Thankfully, no one paid them any heed\u2014until a horn blasted. The Amazons around him straightened, a few even reaching for weapons.</p><p>\u201cRun,\u201d Nola shouted, picking up speed. \u201cRun.\u201d</p><p>No longer content to remain behind her, he matched her pace. A forest loomed a few yards ahead, thick trees promising cover.</p><p>\u201cNola!\u201d someone shouted. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampire,\u201d his captor screamed. \u201cNot another step. I will punish you.\u201d</p><p>Zane tripped over a rock. He lurched forward, his broken ankles unable to support him. When he hit the ground, he hit hard and lost every bit of oxygen in his lungs. Grimacing, he lumbered back up. Started running again.</p><p>All the while, Nola encouraged him. \u201cYou can do it. I know you can. That\u2019s the way. Just a little farther. You\u2019re so strong. You\u2019re so brave. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>Sweeter words had never been spoken. Such encouragement...no one, not even his king, had offered it. He soaked it up, bloomed under it. His speed increased, his steps firmed.</p><p>But when they reached the trees, Nola stopped and screeched. \u201cNo! No, no, no.\u201d</p><p>He, too, stopped and faced her. He tried to grab her, but as before, encountered only air. \u201cCome. Now. We\u2019ll enter the forest and disappear.\u201d Together, he thought again, satisfaction filling him.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. It\u2019s like a wall is blocking me.\u201d Frantic, she tossed a glance over her shoulder at the scowling Amazon warrioresses bearing down on them. \u201cGo. Please. Just go.\u201d</p><p>Still she could not leave the camp\u2019s boundary?</p><p>He remained in place, the screams in his head no longer for his bodily pain. He couldn\u2019t leave this woman behind. But he couldn\u2019t stay here, broken as he was. He was no good to either of them.</p><p>Damn the gods to Hades!</p><p>Demon whore. To think, even for a moment, that he\u2019d felt blessed. Foolish.</p><p>\u201cWill they attempt to punish you?\u201d he asked. He had to know. He would stay here, even broken as he was, even helpless as he was. Anything to protect her.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t hurt me. They might be able to see me, but I\u2019m untouchable, remember?\u201d She smiled, but it didn\u2019t quite reach her eyes. \u201cNow go, before they take you. They will not be as gentle with you this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola...\u201d She is mine. I keep what is mine.</p><p>\u201cZane. Go. Please. Save yourself. You are not meant to be any woman\u2019s slave. Not even mine.\u201d</p><p>A muscle ticked below his eye. \u201cI will come back for you. Soon as I\u2019m healed, I will come back.\u201d As he spoke, he walked backward.</p><p>\u201cI will think and dream of you always.\u201d</p><p>A goodbye? Oh, no. \u201cI will come back,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWatch for me.\u201d Only when she was blocked from his view did he spin and run.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>NOLA FACED OFF WITH HER sisters. They formed a menacing half-circle around her, each glaring at her.</p><p>\u201cYou freed my slave,\u201d Amelia growled, and several warrioresses booed and hissed at Nola.</p><p>She had always been something of a tribe outsider, so she wasn\u2019t surprised at the cold welcome. \u201cHe isn\u2019t yours, but yes,\u201d she said proudly. \u201cI freed him.\u201d And she would do so again. Anything for Zane.</p><p>I will come back, he\u2019d said. Twice. She shivered.</p><p>A frowning Kreja stepped forward, separating herself from the masses and placing herself nose to nose with Nola. \u201cI want five of my elite armed and hunting the vampire within the next five minutes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Footsteps echoed as the warrioresses complied. They could look, but they wouldn\u2019t find him. He was too determined. I will come back.</p><p>\u201cAnd you,\u201d the queen continued, \u201cyou know the punishment for stealing your sister\u2019s slave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nola repeated. The punishment\u2014a savage, wish-you-were-dead whipping. Not that they could administer it. But even if she\u2019d been tangible, she would have risked it. Zane\u2019s freedom was worth losing the skin on her back. At the very least.</p> <p>\u201cDelilah returned and told us you lived still, but that did not stop our worry for you. And now I find you here, working against us. Why would you do such a thing?\u201d the queen asked, sounding genuinely curious, slightly sad, rather than fully enraged.</p><p>\u201cThe vampire had endured enough at the hands of the Amazons. Like us, he is a living being with feelings. He is courageous, wild as the animals in this forest and fierce beyond imagining. We would have broken him.\u201d Or tried to.</p><p>\u201cWise words.\u201d Kreja arched a brow. \u201cAnd yet, he left you here to endure punishment, even though you aided him. Do you find that a worthy trait?\u201d</p><p>I will come back.</p><p>And he would. She had no doubt. Never before had she trusted a man, but she trusted Zane. Having watched him these past few months, she knew he was not the kind of man who made vows lightly. She knew he did not say things simply to placate his audience. Oh, yes. He would return.</p> <p>What they would do when he reached her, she didn\u2019t know. She only knew that she needed to be with him. To see his face and hear his voice. She could live with any curse, as long as he was alive and well and with her.</p><p>\u201cI find him worthy,\u201d she finally replied.</p><p>Kreja sighed. \u201cThat does not change what you have done. Not only did you free a slave, you freed your sister\u2019s slave. For that, you will deal with Amelia in the battle arena. She will be armed. You will not. Afterward, if you survive, you will be whipped, as is our custom.\u201d</p><p>The queen reached out\u2014and wrapped her fingers around Nola\u2019s suddenly solid forearm, dragging her toward the arena, Amelia marching close on her heels.</p><p>Nola gasped in shock. What...why...how was it possible? She could be touched now.</p><p>\u201cI will not go easy on you,\u201d Amelia snarled at her.</p> <p>They can touch me. Which means they can hurt me, Nola realized, dread sweeping through her.</p><p>Would she be alive when Zane returned?</p><p>ZANE REACHED THE VAMPIRE stronghold and collapsed at its gates. His strength\u2014gone. His wounds\u2014unhealed. Followed as he\u2019d been, he hadn\u2019t been able to hunt for food. Broken as he was, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to capture a single animal and feed himself.</p><p>Thankfully the guards recognized him. He was hefted over a shoulder and carted inside the palace. The touch disturbed him, but he didn\u2019t fight it. He was in too much of a hurry and knew this was the best way. By the time they reached his personal chamber, there was a buzz of activity, his name being whispered from everyone\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cBlood,\u201d he rasped as the guard lay him down on the bed.</p><p>That guard tilted his head, offering his own neck.</p><p>Zane shook his head and closed his eyes. \u201cGlass.\u201d He would not take from a living source. Still couldn\u2019t stomach the thought\u2014unless that living source was Nola. Once, when he\u2019d ensured she would welcome him by invading her dreams, he had tasted her. The sweetness of her blood...the decadence of her moans...he\u2019d reveled in every nuance of her. He would not overshadow that precious memory by taking from someone else, even in his desperation.</p><p>How did she affect him this way?</p> <p>Would he always be forced to wonder?</p><p>Perhaps he did not mind her hands on him because he saw himself in her eyes. Every damned time he looked at her. He saw vulnerability and pain, fear and yearning.</p><p>Perhaps they shared a similar past; she\u2019d alluded to such a thing once before, when they\u2019d been pitted against each other on the island. Back then, he had been too wrapped in his newfound desire to pay much attention to her words. Never again, he vowed. What she said came first. Always. As did protecting her, defending her.</p><p>And maybe she would feel the same about him.</p><p>He suddenly wanted to hug her close and tell her everything that had happened to him. Admit that he\u2019d once been the demon queen\u2019s willing sexual toy. She might...she might understand rather than run.</p><p>Demon whore.</p><p>How could anyone understand?</p><p>But for once, the taunt did not drive him to distraction. She might, and for now, that was enough.</p><p>Warm hands settled on his shoulders and shook him.</p><p>His eyelids fluttered open, a growl in his throat. When he saw that Layel loomed above him, glass in hand, he forced himself to relax against the feathered mattress. \u201cMy king, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo talking just yet. Drink,\u201d Layel said, placing the glass to his lips. Tall and leanly muscled, with white hair and blue eyes, he was an eerily beautiful sight that reminded Zane of both his rescue from the demon queen and the horrors he\u2019d later endured at the hands of the gods. \u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>Zane opened his mouth, and the sweet nectar of life poured down his throat. He swallowed greedily. Once again, warmth spread through him. Warmth and strength and determination.</p><p>He had not lied to Nola. He was going back for her. He would conquer that damn camp and everyone inside it.</p><p>Nola will not like that. Those women are her sisters.</p><p>Well, they damn well should not have tried to enslave him, he thought darkly. But he knew deep down that he wouldn\u2019t hurt them. Not really. For Nola, he would simply send them on their way, claiming the camp as his own and remaining there until she could leave it. And if she could never leave it, he would never leave it.</p><p>\u201cGood now?\u201d Layel asked.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d he said when the supply ran out. He\u2019d need every ounce of his strength to conquer the Amazons.</p><p>Layel cut his wrist, filled the glass with his own life force, and offered it up. This time, Zane was able to hold the glass on his own. Again, he drained every drop. When he finished, he licked his lips and faced the king.</p><p>\u201cI am ready to talk,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood. I have questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnswer mine first. You escaped the gods and their island.\u201d He grunted as his wrists and ankles popped back into place. \u201cDid you win their game?\u201d</p><p>The king\u2019s lips slowly lifted in a grin. \u201cDelilah did. She saved us both. We have been searching for you since the moment of our return, but the Amazons hid you well. We knew you were there, but we could find no sign of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you news of my sister?\u201d a female voice asked.</p><p>Zane looked past his king and saw Delilah standing in the doorway. She was petite in appearance, but as fierce as Nola on a battlefield. Her blue hair was falling around her shoulders, and worry was etched in the violet depths of her eyes.</p><p>\u201cShe is alive,\u201d he told her, and she expelled a relieved breath. \u201cAnd she is mine.\u201d</p><p>A pause.</p><p>\u201cAnd does she agree with that statement?\u201d Delilah\u2019s head tilted to the side as she rubbed at her slightly rounded belly. There was barely contained fury in her tone. She would slay him without mercy if he hurt Nola, that much was obvious.</p><p>Rather than plead his case, he focused on that belly. Slightly rounded. A baby? Layel was to become a father? An ache bloomed in Zane\u2019s chest. He\u2019d wanted children with Cassandra. Had dreamed of them. Yet that, too, had been denied him. Until...now?</p><p>With Nola... You cannot truly touch her, you fool. That dream is still dead. He couldn\u2019t make himself care, however. As long as he had Nola, nothing else mattered.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Delilah insisted.</p><p>Did Nola wish to belong to him? she\u2019d asked. He thought so, yes. She had helped him. She had even wanted to go with him. But she was also a warrior to her core, an Amazon warrior at that, and they only tolerated men during mating season. He wanted far more than that. No matter the circumstances. He wanted what Layel and Delilah clearly had.</p><p>\u201cWe will see,\u201d Zane said, kicking his legs over the bed.</p><p>\u201cYou only just returned,\u201d Layel said. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get my woman.\u201d This one, he wouldn\u2019t let get away.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>GRUNTS, GROANS AND THE CLANG of metal against metal roused Nola from her troubled sleep. She wanted to rise, to see what was happening, but could not force her body into action. Her back was a mass of agony, the skin flayed completely. The rest of her, well, it had not fared much better during her battle with Amelia. Nola had won, her determination stronger than any weapon, but she had not emerged unscathed. There were deep sword slices all down her arms, stomach and legs.</p><p>She lay on her bed, her stomach pressed into soft blankets. Alone, always alone. No one was allowed to help her. Not in any way. Amazons healed as slowly as humans, so she knew she would suffer like this for many weeks to come.</p><p>Outside, a scream echoed. Her muscles were heavy as stones, and she didn\u2019t have the strength to drag herself upright. Or gather food. Not that she even had the strength to eat. She wanted to help her sisters, though. Despite what had been done to her, she loved them.</p><p>They had welcomed her into their fold when she\u2019d had nowhere else to go. They had despised her mother for what the woman had done to her.</p><p>\u201cYou will die for this, vampires!\u201d someone shouted.</p><p>\u201cNot by your hand,\u201d she heard a male voice say. The vampire king? That had sounded like his rough, cocky timbre.</p><p>Despite her pain, Nola grinned. Relaxed.</p><p>Zane was here.</p><p>For hours, the battle continued to rage. Nola didn\u2019t want her sisters injured, but neither did she want Zane to lose, and waiting proved difficult. She chewed at her cheeks, dug her nails into her palms and broke into a sweat, which caused her back to burn as if it had been set on fire as well as flayed.</p><p>Finally, the tent flap rose and light flooded inside. And then he was there, standing in front of her. Her vampire. Zane. Her heart knocked against her ribs.</p><p>\u201cKnew you\u2019d come,\u201d she said, her voice barely audible. She hadn\u2019t screamed during her whipping, hadn\u2019t made a sound, but holding her cries inside had scraped her throat raw. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNola...sweet...\u201d He approached her slowly, as if she were a trapped animal. \u201cWhat did they do to you?\u201d There was horror in his tone. He crouched beside her, reached out and smoothed her hair from her damp forehead. Then he froze. \u201cHow is this possible? I\u2019m touching you. Feeling your warmth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Happened just after you\u2019d left.\u201d Any other time, she would have been mortified for him to see her like this: broken, helpless, naked but for a sheet covering her lower half. Her relief at seeing him alive and well, however, was simply too great.</p><p>\u201cI will destroy the gods for this. How dare they do this to you! Allow you to feel only when you will be injured. The cruelty such an act requires... I will find a way to raid the heavens and I will\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no. This is a blessing. I\u2019ve had time to think, and I believe I know what\u2019s happening. Each time I admit something about you, like the fact that you did not deserve what was done to you, and that I trust you, I\u2019ve been given back a piece of my life.\u201d</p><p>His brows furrowed together, and a spark of hope entered his eyes. \u201cCan you pass the camp boundary now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My sisters carried me there, meaning to toss me out after my whipping, but that invisible wall blocked them.\u201d</p><p>Fury replaced the hope. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hurt your sisters\u2014I knew you would hate it if we did, but now I wish I\u2019d sliced each and every one of them to pieces. They abandoned camp or I would see to it now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here now. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d And it was. \u201cBut...how long will you be able to stay?\u201d Her nervousness returned. His king would want him back. And the Amazons would one day come back. This was not the first time their camp had been taken. They always came back. Angrier. Far more brutal. \u201cYou can\u2019t remain forever, and I can\u2019t leave. We\u2019ll be forced to separate again and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s all right, sweet. Do not worry yourself. Think only of healing. I\u2019m here, and I\u2019m not leaving without you. No matter what. You freed me. I will find a way to free you.\u201d</p><p>The burst of strength her nervousness had given her drained, and she expelled a breath. \u201cAs long as I have you, I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d The words flowed freely. Talking about her feelings was becoming easier.</p><p>\u201cYes, you will.\u201d He stretched out beside her and angled his head, displaying his neck to her. The scent of him filled her nose. Dark spice and tree dew. She inhaled deeply, savoring. \u201cDrink,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d Even when they\u2019d been trapped on that island, he had not let anyone drink from him. Not from his wrist, and certainly not from his neck.</p><p>\u201cDrink. I know biting and blood are distasteful to your kind, but you will heal faster if my blood flows inside your veins. I have watched others of my kind do this for their mates who were not vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t mind drinking from you. I just don\u2019t want to disgust you. I know you do not like such things being done to you.\u201d</p> <p>Precious little lights flickered in his eyes. \u201cI want to give you everything, Nola. Even this. With you and no other. I need this, so please. Please.\u201d</p><p>Please, this proud, strong man had said. How could she deny him? She cried out as she edged toward him\u2014pain, so much pain\u2014and sank her teeth into his neck, hard as she could, cutting past skin and hitting vein. Blood instantly trickled down her throat.</p><p>Once, the thought of doing this would have been distasteful to her, as he\u2019d claimed. But this was Zane. She wanted him inside her. Any part of him that she could get. And like him, she wanted him to have everything she had to give.</p><p>\u201cI never thought to allow someone to take from me again,\u201d he said, petting her head. \u201cI\u2014I have to tell you something. Something that may make you hate me. But you deserve to know.\u201d</p><p>Nothing could make her hate him. Nothing.</p><p>He did not give her time to tell him that. \u201cThe demon queen,\u201d he continued. \u201cI was her slave for many centuries. Her...bedmate. Willingly. She took from me whenever and however she desired. Her methods sickened me, but I allowed them because she had something\u2014someone\u2014my compliance was supposed to purchase.\u201d</p><p>Nola released his neck. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Do not speak. Keep drinking. There is more I must tell you, but my courage will abandon me if your mouth is gone from me.\u201d</p> <p>She sank her teeth back into his neck, the warmth of his blood spinning through her, lighting her up from the inside out.</p><p>\u201cWhen she died and I was freed, I thought to never endure such things again. You, though, I think I would allow to do anything to me. It has been that way from the first. I don\u2019t understand it, either. Your presence doesn\u2019t drown out the memories or take away my revulsion for this act. My...need for you simply overrides it. Even though I fear you will find me, a dirty demon whore, unworthy of you. I am unworthy of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, wrenching away. Blood trickled from the side of her mouth. \u201cYou are perfect. Wonderful.\u201d She snuggled into his waiting embrace, head cradled in the hollow of his neck. The action pained her, but only a little. She could feel the flesh weaving together on her back. \u201cNever say otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou...you do not wish to leave me now?\u201d So hesitant. So unsure.</p><p>\u201cIf you are a demon whore, then I am an Amazon whore. When I was a child, my mother mated with a man and left the Amazon camp to live with him. They had no money and so they...sold me, time and time again,\u201d she said, heat spreading over her cheeks. \u201cI know the desire to never again be touched by another. Except you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweet. I am so sorry for what you endured. And you are not a whore. Never say such a thing.\u201d</p><p>That gentle tone brought tears to her eyes. \u201cIf I cannot, you cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d He wrapped his arm around her, careful of her injuries. \u201cYou once told me your family had destroyed you, that you had killed them for it, but until now, I had no idea they\u2019d done such things to you.\u201d</p><p>She flattened her palm against his chest, exactly as she\u2019d wanted to do all these months while watching him. His heart beat fast and hard. \u201cMaybe we remind each other of what we were like, before. Unafraid, untainted. Maybe we see the future in each other and the past ceases to matter.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reply, which disappointed her. Instead, he settled her onto the blankets and sat up. Old fears surfaced. Did he not want a future with her? Was that what his silence signified? Did he\u2014</p><p>He traced a fingertip along her spine, and she shivered. \u201cAll healed,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cAnd now, all mine.\u201d</p><p>Thank the gods. She wasn\u2019t sure what she would have done if he\u2019d rebuffed her as she\u2019d once done him. You should not have doubted him. Even for a moment.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t. Not ever again.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me, Zane.\u201d She\u2019d never been with a man of her choosing. Never given herself completely. She was suddenly desperate to know what that was like. With this man. Only this man, who was surely a gift from the heavens, even amid her curse. \u201cPlease. Let us join.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>ZANE FLIPPED N OLA TO HER back so that she was peering up at him. A gasp escaped her, but she didn\u2019t try to scramble away, even though he loomed above her, dressed in his blood-splattered battle clothes while she was naked.</p><p>Her breasts were small but firm, perfectly tipped with hard pink nipples. Her stomach was flat, her skin sun-kissed and smooth. He could see every ridge of her ribs and knew she hadn\u2019t eaten since his departure six days ago. Damn her sisters! Had she not already been through enough torment, without her tribe adding to it?</p><p>He was going to burn away the images of what they\u2019d done to her. Burn away the memories of the men who had used her. He would replace both with thoughts of himself. He didn\u2019t care what he had to do to accomplish it.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever experienced pleasure in the act?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Up and down her chest rose with the force of her breathing. \u201cA few times. Perhaps a little. But it was...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no more. I understand.\u201d And he did. Even when you hated the person you were bedding, your body sometimes reacted.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Nola asked.</p><p>\u201cLong, long ago.\u201d He only prayed he remembered how to please his woman. With the demon queen, he hadn\u2019t cared to try. He\u2019d simply endured. Never had a female\u2019s enjoyment been more important to him. \u201cIf I scare you, do something you don\u2019t like, tell me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, nervously licked her lips. \u201cYou tell me, as well.\u201d</p><p>It was his turn to nod. Rather than suck on her nipples as he desired, he lifted himself off her, reached behind him and tugged off his shirt. He tossed the material aside. His boots and pants quickly followed, leaving him as bare as she was.</p><p>Nola\u2019s gaze traveled the length of him, and fire leapt inside her turquoise eyes. \u201cZane...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You won\u2019t hurt me. I just wanted you to know I like what I see. You are beautiful. So pale and strong.\u201d</p><p>Her trust emboldened him, as did her praise. Gently he eased atop her. Skin against skin, hardness against softness. They moaned in unison. Contact with anyone else, even his king, was hell. Contact with Nola was heaven. Her legs opened, allowing him a deep cradle.</p><p>So soft.</p><p>\u201cI want to kiss you now,\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Only when she whispered her consent did he lean down and press his lips against hers. Softly at first, barely even a touch. But the sweet scent of her was in his nose, her nipples hard against his chest, her thighs pliant against his, and soon he had to have more. He licked at her, and her lips eagerly parted. His tongue glided past teeth to intertwine with hers.</p><p>He\u2019d had her blood, but he\u2019d never had her mouth. To his delight, this was even better. Sweeter, headier, not for living or healing or even to relieve hunger, but simply for pleasure. It was addictive, and he wondered how he\u2019d gone without this for so long. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tentatively, she tangled her hands in his hair. And at first, her tongue was hesitant against his. Seeking, as if she wasn\u2019t sure what to do with it. But the more he explored her mouth, the bolder she became. Soon their teeth were banging together, their bodies writhing against each other. Sweat was beading over his skin, his blood heating as though lava flowed in his veins.</p><p>\u201cGoing to...suck your...breasts now,\u201d he managed to say between pants. \u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Yes.\u201d She, too, was panting. She, too, was sweating. Her eyes were closed and her head was thrashing from side to side.</p> <p>I did that. Pride filled him as he lowered his head, fitting his lips around one tight little pearl. He laved it with attention before turning to the other one\u2014careful, so careful to deliver pleasure without any sting.</p><p>When he kissed his way down her stomach, she quivered and gasped his name.</p><p>\u201cStop?\u201d he asked. It would be difficult, but he would find a way.</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>Thank the gods. Never had he been more determined in his life. He would know this woman, every inch of her. Nothing would be prohibited. Body, mind...soul. Mouth watering, he licked between her legs. Wet, wild, wanton.</p> <p>A memory of doing this very thing to the demon queen slipped into his mind. Do not think about the demon. She has no place in this wondrous moment. He\u2019d once hated this act\u2014until he\u2019d tried it on Nola on that island. Oh, how he had enjoyed doing so, which had shocked him. Since then, he\u2019d craved it\u2014another shock. He wanted this to last forever. Nola was precious, a treasure, her cries a drug for his ears.</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d Please, please, please.</p><p>\u201cMmm, yes. Before, they just ripped at my clothes and shoved their way\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. None of that.\u201d As she\u2019d spoken, she\u2019d stopped writhing. Had released her death grip on his hair. \u201cThat does not belong between us. It\u2019s just you and me in this bed. You and me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were luminous as she nodded. \u201cBite me, then. Take my blood and remind me that my vampire is claiming me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. No, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you do not take from living beings?\u201d she asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cYou, I would gladly take from. Anytime you would have me.\u201d It was the truth. \u201cBut as I told you, I know your kind abhors that, and I will never ask you to do anything you do not want to do. I will find my nourishment elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she shouted, and it was a soldier\u2019s cry. She might appear delicate, but she truly had the soul of a warrior. \u201cYou will only ever take from me.\u201d</p><p>A possessive warrior, he realized, wanting to grin. He crawled up her body, fit his cock against her moist entrance. \u201cI will only ever crave you, sweet. That much is true. Are you ready for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I need you inside me. I need to feel you, as deep as you can go. Your shaft\u2014and your teeth. Take all of me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Oh, that please... He\u2019d seen the way her expression softened when he\u2019d uttered that word. Now she thought to use it against him, bless her.</p><p>Inch by inch, he sank inside her, careful, meticulous. Never had he exercised such exquisite care. Finally, though, he was in her to the hilt. They were joined; they were one. She surrounded him, hot and tight and wet, and it was better than he\u2019d anticipated.</p><p>Tenderly he cupped her face. Her beautiful face. His thumbs brushed over her lips. He would care for her all the days of his life. He would ensure no one ever hurt her again.</p> <p>\u201cReady for more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith you? Always.\u201d</p><p>He withdrew from her, almost all the way out, before sinking back in and groaning at the bliss. Her back arched, and her perfect white teeth nibbled on her bottom lip. Her head fell to the side, revealing the delicious plane of her neck. Still he did not bite her. He wouldn\u2019t. Wouldn\u2019t do that to her.</p><p>In and out he moved, in and out he savored her. He stared into her eyes the entire time, and she stared into his. It was as if they were each other\u2019s anchor. As if seeing each other kept them here, locked in the moment, just the two of them, safe and cherished. There was nothing else, no one else, the fruition of every secret yearning he\u2019d ever possessed.</p><p>\u201cBite,\u201d she commanded.</p><p>\u201cNo. You are still healing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I am healed. You told me so. Bite me. I want it. I need it. Don\u2019t deny me this. Please, don\u2019t deny me this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Zane. Please. With you, nothing seems wrong. Don\u2019t make me beg.\u201d</p><p>He could not stand the thought of this strong woman begging for anything. He bit, fangs drilling into her neck. The sweetness of her taste exploded on his tongue, through his body, making his muscles quiver and his bones vibrate.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d she cried as her inner walls spasmed around his shaft. \u201cZane, Zane.\u201d Her hands clutched at his back, her nails digging into his muscles. \u201cYes, yes, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola!\u201d That was all his body needed to propel into its own release. He roared, shooting inside her, filling her up with everything that he was. In that moment, his entire existence made sense. He\u2019d been born to be this woman\u2019s mate. He\u2019d given himself to a demon to better understand this precious woman\u2019s pain. He\u2019d been chosen for the gods\u2019 cruel game to ensure this woman\u2019s survival.</p><p>He loved her. Would always love her.</p><p>And now, he thought, an idea springing to life, he would save her.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>NOLA CUDDLED AGAINST Zane\u2019s body, happier than she\u2019d ever been in her life. She\u2019d just made love. Truly made love. And it had been amazing. Her body had hummed with pleasure, and her mind had soared to the heavens.</p><p>Only once had she considered her past, and Zane had quickly defeated the memories, as only a strong, fierce warrior could. No one had ever made her feel as protected or as prized as this man had.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t thought such feelings possible, actually.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d she said, grinning. She was buzzing with joy, drunk with it, and just might smile for the rest of her life. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did do a good job, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>It was the first time he\u2019d ever teased her, and she liked it. A laugh bubbled from her; she couldn\u2019t hold it back. Soon she was laughing so hard, tears were streaming down her cheeks. Laughter.</p><p>Shocking.</p><p>Zane\u2019s lips were twitching. \u201cSome men would take this as a criticism of their performance.\u201d</p><p>Only when her giggles subsided did she say, \u201cBut as you know you did a good job...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not one of them,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>They shared a grin. What a tranquil, amazing moment. The first she\u2019d ever had. But she knew it would be the first of many.</p><p>His arms tightened around her. \u201cYou said every time you admitted something about me, you were freed from some part of your curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Reminded of her plight, some of the happiness drained from her.</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cThen do you have something else to admit to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well... I\u2014\u201d Nola sat up and peered down at him. No longer did he appear so confident and joyous. His expression was blank. No, not blank. Fear was sparking in the depths of his eyes. For some reason, seeing it gave her courage. \u201cI love you. I love you so much I ache with it.\u201d The words tumbled from her; she couldn\u2019t stop them. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine my life without you in it. I want to make love to you every night and wake up to you every morning. And I don\u2019t want you to think I\u2019m saying this only because I wish to lift the curse. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are too honest for such a trick.\u201d He grabbed her and rolled her under him. \u201cAnd just so you know, I love you, too. So much I would die without you. You are my life, my heart, my everything. Wherever you are, that\u2019s where I want to be.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t dared dream of having a man like him, or a life like they would surely lead, not even as a child. It had seemed too much to ask, too unattainable, and she had preferred to wallow in her sorrows rather than risk hope.</p><p>\u201cThe gods didn\u2019t take your ability from you, you know,\u201d she said. \u201cNot completely. You can still create dreams. For the first time in my life, I see joy in my future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Nola. You are my joy.\u201d</p><p>With another laugh, she threw her arms around him and rolled him to his back. Her dark hair fell around him, forming a curtain that left only the two of them\u2014just the way she liked it.</p><p>They made love twice more and spent several hours simply talking and getting to know each other better, before dressing and emerging from the tent. Night had fallen, but vampire warriors still patrolled the area.</p><p>She froze in place. \u201cZane. I don\u2019t know about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must speak with Layel,\u201d he said, remaining beside her. \u201cInform him that you will be coming with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can.\u201d</p><p>He sounded confident. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou admitted you loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but that might not be the admission needed to free me from this camp.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her, perhaps sensing there was nothing he could say to assuage her fears. \u201cNow, where is that king of mine?\u201d</p><p>Distraction. He did know her well. Nola spotted the king and her sister in front of the fire, and gulped. There was no love lost between herself and Delilah. Nola had once tried to murder Layel, after all. \u201cWill they...what if...\u201d</p><p>Zane captured her hand with his own and squeezed. \u201cThey will love and welcome you or we will find somewhere else to live.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to lose everything you hold dear because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola,\u201d he said, forcing her to look up at him. \u201cYou are all that I hold dear. Nothing else matters to me.\u201d</p><p>Tears burned her eyes. \u201cWhat did I ever do to deserve you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is I who is undeserving. But you have my word, I will do everything in my power to prove myself worthy of you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pressed a soft kiss to his lips. \u201cYou already have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNola,\u201d she heard Delilah call.</p><p>Zane wrapped his arms around her, keeping her in the protection of his embrace as they started forward. The blue-haired warrioress was walking toward her, expression blank. Layel stayed close on her heels, a blade in his hand, as protective of his woman as Zane was of Nola.</p> <p>\u201cYou are well?\u201d Delilah said, looking her over.</p><p>\u201cYes. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And then Delilah was there, grinning, pushing Zane aside to hug her tightly. \u201cI\u2019ve been so worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Nola glanced at Zane and he gave her a nod of encouragement. Biting her lip, Nola hugged her sister back. Shocking, she thought again.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was going to have to burst into that tent and give Zane a stern talking-to,\u201d Delilah said, pulling back, grin widening. \u201cBut the moans were of pleasure rather than rebuke, so Layel was able to hold me back.\u201d</p> <p>Nola\u2019s cheeks heated.</p><p>So did Zane\u2019s, she noticed. And for some reason, that eased her own embarrassment. They were in this together.</p><p>Layel slapped him on the back. Zane stiffened for a moment, then relaxed against Nola. \u201cGood man,\u201d the king said with a laugh. \u201cDoing our people proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shall we go home?\u201d Delilah asked. She rubbed her belly, which Nola suddenly realized was not quite as flat as she remembered. \u201cAs protector of this little hellion, I am not the soldier I once was and prefer the comfort of my own bed.\u201d</p><p>A baby. Nola again glanced at Zane. He offered a soft smile\u2014one that promised they, too, would one day experience such a joy. \u201cCongratulations, Delilah. I am so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>Delilah beamed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>The warrioress and her husband shared a tender smile before Layel escorted her a few feet away, to where the horses were chewing on grass. \u201cZane? Will you be joining us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Nola welcome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d No hesitation.</p><p>\u201cThen, yes. We shall try.\u201d</p><p>Whether the king understood or not, he merely nodded. \u201cBack to the palace, men,\u201d he called.</p><p>Zane helped Nola atop his horse, then swooped up behind her. Nervousness skidded through her when they began moving. First Layel and Delilah disappeared beyond the trees, then the vampire troops. Soon their turn would come...soon she would know if she was still bound to the camp.</p><p>\u201cZane,\u201d she said, unable to keep the tremor from her voice.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word, just urged the horse into a quicker pace. And then they were past the trees, just like everyone else. They were in the forest, foliage surrounding them, heading away from their captivity.</p> <p>\u201cWe did it! We\u2019re free! We\u2019re really free!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I knew we would be.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cThe gods are not the cruel monsters I imagined. How can they be, when they paired us together?\u201d</p><p>Thank you, she mouthed to the top of the dome. Not once did she look back. There was too much to look forward to. \u201cI love you, Zane. So much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you. It will be my pleasure to prove it to you, over and over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven when mating season ends?\u201d she teased.</p><p>He squeezed her tight. \u201cI have a feeling our mating season will last for eternity, sweet.\u201d</p><p>So did she. Oh, yes, so did she.</p><p>THE DARKEST PRISON</p><p>PROLOGUE</p><p>REYES, ONCE AN IMMORTAL warrior for the gods, now possessed by the demon of Pain and living in Budapest, entered his bedroom. He was drenched in sweat and panting from the force of his workout. Because he could not experience pleasure without physical suffering, the burn in his muscles had excited him. Was exciting him.</p><p>As always, his gaze sought out his woman, and he palmed the blade they preferred to use during their loveplay. She was sitting at the edge of their big bed, lovely features drawn tight as she studied the canvas in front of her. A canvas she\u2019d propped on an easel and lowered so that she had a direct view. Blond hair fell to her shoulders in wild disarray, as if she\u2019d tangled her fingers through the thick mass multiple times, and she was chewing on her bottom lip.</p><p>Sex could wait, he decided then. She was troubled, and he would be unable to think of anything else until he\u2019d solved this dilemma for her. Whatever it was. He sheathed the blade.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong, angel?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lifted and landed on him, worry in their emerald depths. She offered him a small smile. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, why don\u2019t I help you figure it out?\u201d Anything that bothered her, he would dispatch. No hesitation. For her happiness, he would do anything, kill anyone.</p><p>\u201cI would like that, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I shower before I join you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I like you just how you are.\u201d</p><p>Darling woman. But he didn\u2019t like the thought of dirtying her pretty clothes. He quickly grabbed a towel from the bathroom and rubbed himself dry. Only then did he settle behind his woman, his legs encasing hers, his arms wrapping around her waist. Breathing deeply of her wild storm scent, he rested his chin in the hollow of her neck and followed the direction of her gaze.</p><p>What he saw surprised him.</p><p>It shouldn\u2019t have. Her paintings were always vivid. As the All-Seeing Eye, an oracle of the gods and one of their most cherished aides, she could peer into heaven and Hell. And did, every night, though she had no control over what she witnessed. Past, present, future, it didn\u2019t matter. Every morning, she painted what she\u2019d seen.</p><p>This one was of a man. A warrior, clearly. With that muscle mass, he had to be. A gold collar circled his neck, cinching tight. He was on his knees, legs spread. His arms rested on his thighs, palms raised. His dark head was thrown back, and he was roaring up at a domed ceiling. In pain, perhaps. Maybe even fury. There was blood smeared all over his chest, seeping from multiple wounds. Wounds that looked as if his skin had been carved away.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d Reyes asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen him before.\u201d</p><p>Then they would reason this out as best they were able. \u201cWas he from heaven or Hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeaven. Definitely. I think he\u2019s in Cronus\u2019s throne room.\u201d</p><p>A god, then? A few months ago, Titans had overthrown the Greeks and seized control of the divine throne. So, if this man was in Cronus\u2019s throne room, chained up, hurt, and Cronus was leader of the Titans, that must mean the warrior was a Greek. A slave who had been punished, perhaps?</p><p>\u201cYou saw only this image?\u201d Reyes asked. \u201cNot what got him to this point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrect,\u201d Danika said with a nod. \u201cI heard him scream, though. It was...\u201d She shuddered, and his arms squeezed her in comfort. \u201cI felt so sorry for him. Never have I heard so much rage and helplessness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can summon Cronus.\u201d Cronus wasn\u2019t too fond of Reyes and his fellow Lords of the Underworld\u2014the very men who had opened Pandora\u2019s box, unleashing the evil from inside. The men who had then been cursed to carry that evil inside themselves. But the god king hated their enemy, the Hunters, more, because Danika had seen Galen, the leader of the Hunters, chop off Cronus\u2019s head in a vision. Now the god king was determined to kill Galen before Galen could kill him. Even if that meant soliciting the aid of the Lords. \u201cWe can ask him if he knows this man.\u201d</p><p>A moment passed while Danika pondered his suggestion. Finally, she sighed, nodded. \u201cYes. I\u2019d like that.\u201d Then she surprised him by turning to him and offering the sweetest smile he\u2019d ever seen. Well, all of her smiles were that way. \u201cBut it\u2019s too early in the morning to summon anyone, and besides, I think you had other things on your mind when you entered the room. Why don\u2019t you tell me about them?\u201d she suggested huskily.</p><p>He was rock hard in seconds\u2014that\u2019s what she did to him. \u201cThat would be my pleasure, angel.\u201d</p><p>She pushed him to his back, smile widening. \u201cAnd mine.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>\u201cBE STILL, N IKE. Y OU\u2019RE ONLY making this worse for yourself.\u201d Atlas, Titan god of Strength, stared down at the bane of his existence. Nike, Greek goddess of Strength. And Victory, he inwardly sneered. She loved to remind him that many called her the goddess of Strength and Victory. As if she were better than him. In reality, she was his godly counterpart. His equal. His enemy. And an all-around grade-A bitch.</p><p>Two of his best men held her arms and two held her legs. They should have been able to pin her without incident. She was collared, after all, and that collar prevented her from using any of her immortal powers. Even her legendary strength\u2014strength that was not on par with his, thank you. But never had a female been more stubborn\u2014or more determined to fell him. She continually struggled against their hold, punching, kicking and biting like a cornered animal.</p><p>\u201cI will kill you for this,\u201d she growled at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy? I\u2019m not doing anything to you that you didn\u2019t once have done to me.\u201d Motions clipped, Atlas tore his shirt over his head and tossed the material aside, revealing his chest, the ropes of his stomach. There, in the center, in big black letters spanning from one tiny brown nipple to the other, was her name, spelled out for all the world to see. N-I-K-E.</p><p>She\u2019d branded him, reduced him to her property.</p><p>Had he deserved it? Maybe. Once, he\u2019d been a prisoner in this bleak realm. In Tartarus, a divine dungeon. He\u2019d been a god overthrown and locked away, forgotten, no better than rubbish. He\u2019d wanted out, and he had been willing to do anything to see it done. Anything. So he had seduced Nike, one of his guards, using her amorous feelings for him against her.</p><p>Though she would deny it now, she truly had fallen a little in love with him. The proof: she\u2019d arranged his escape, a crime punishable by death. Yet she\u2019d been willing to risk it. For him. Only, just before she could remove his collar, allowing him to flash himself away\u2014moving from one place to another with only a thought\u2014she discovered that he had also seduced several other female guards. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why rely on one to get the job done when four could serve him better?</p><p>He\u2019d counted on the fact that none of the Greek females would want their affair with an enslaved Titan known. He\u2019d counted on their silence.</p><p>What he should have done was count on their jealousy. Women.</p> <p>Nike had realized she\u2019d been used, that his emotions had never really been engaged. Rather than throw him back into his cell and pretend he did not exist, rather than have him beaten, she\u2019d had him held down and marked permanently.</p><p>For years he\u2019d dreamed of returning the favor. Sometimes he thought the desire was the only thing that kept him sane as he whiled away century after century in this hellhole. Alone, darkness his only companion.</p><p>Imagine his delight when the prison walls began to crack. When the defenses began to crumble. When their collars fell away. It had taken a while, but he and his brethren had finally managed to work their way free. They\u2019d attacked the Greeks, brutally and without mercy.</p><p>In a matter of days, they had won.</p><p>The Greeks were defeated and now locked exactly where they\u2019d locked the Titans. Atlas had volunteered to oversee the realm and had thankfully been placed in charge. Finally, his day of vengeance had arrived. Nike would forever bear his mark.</p> <p>\u201cYou should be grateful you\u2019re alive,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled slowly, evilly. \u201cYou\u2019ve done that, remember?\u201d</p><p>Her struggles increased. Increased so viciously she was soon panting and sweating right alongside his men. \u201cYou bastard! I will flay you alive. I will torch you to ash. Bastard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlip her over,\u201d he ordered the guards over her curses. No mercy. Atlas didn\u2019t have the patience to wait until she tired. \u201cAnd a warning to you, Nike. You had best be still. I\u2019ll just keep tattooing until my name is clear enough to satisfy me.\u201d</p><p>With a frustrated, infuriated screech, she finally settled down. She knew he spoke true. He always spoke true. Threats were not something he wasted his breath uttering. Only promises.</p> <p>\u201cBastard,\u201d she rasped again.</p><p>He\u2019d been called worse. And by her, no less. \u201cThat\u2019s a good girl.\u201d Atlas strode forward and ripped the cloth from her back. The skin was tanned, smooth. Flawless. Once, he\u2019d caressed this back. Once, he\u2019d kissed and licked it. And yes, being with her had been more satisfying than being with any of the others, because she\u2019d looked at him with such adoration, such hope and awe. He\u2019d felt...humbled. Lucky to be there, touching her. But he would not be ruled by his dick and release her before branding her, all in the hopes that he could get her into bed again.</p><p>He would do this.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I did to you,\u201d Nike growled. \u201cI didn\u2019t mark your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would rather I brand your lovely breasts?\u201d</p><p>At that, she held her tongue.</p><p>Good. He didn\u2019t want to mar her chest. Her breasts were a work of art, surely the world\u2019s finest creation. \u201cNo need to thank me,\u201d he muttered. He held out his hand and someone slapped the needed supplies in his palm. \u201cAt least you won\u2019t have to look at my name every day of your too-long life.\u201d As he had to do. \u201cEveryone else will, though. They\u2019ll see.\u201d And they\u2019ll know who mastered her at last.</p> <p>\u201cEvery lover I choose, you mean.\u201d</p><p>He popped his jaw. \u201cNot another word from you. It is time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d she suddenly cried. \u201cPlease. Don\u2019t.\u201d She turned her head and there were tears in her brown eyes.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a beautiful woman. Could barely be called pretty. Her nose was a little too long, and her cheeks a little too sharp. She had ordinary brown hair cut to hit her too-wide shoulders, and no true curves to speak of. Besides her breasts. No, she had the body of a warrior. But there was something about her that had always drawn him.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Atlas. Please.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cDry the fake tears, Nike.\u201d And he knew they were fake. She wasn\u2019t prone to displays of emotion. \u201cThey don\u2019t affect me and they certainly don\u2019t become you.\u201d</p><p>Instantly her eyelids narrowed, the tears miraculously gone. \u201cFine. But I will make you regret this. I vow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to your attempts.\u201d Truth. Sparring with her had always excited him. She should know that by now.</p><p>Without a single beat of hesitation, he pressed the ink gun just below her shoulder blade. His grip was steady as he etched the outline of the first letter. A. Not once did she flinch. Not once did she act as if she felt a single ounce of pain. He knew it hurt, though. Oh, did he know. To permanently mark an immortal, ambrosia had to be mixed into the colored liquid and that ambrosia burned like acid.</p><p>She remained silent as he finished each of the outlines. Silent, still, as he filled in the letters. When he finished, he sat back on his haunches and surveyed his work: A-T-L-A-S.</p><p>He expected satisfaction to overtake him, so long had he waited for this moment. It didn\u2019t. He expected relief to overwhelm him; finally vengeance had been achieved. It didn\u2019t. What he didn\u2019t expect was a white-hot sweep of possessiveness, but that\u2019s exactly what he experienced. Mine.</p><p>Nike now belonged to him. Forever. And all the world would know it.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>NIKE PACED THE CONFINES of her cell. A cell she shared with several others. Knowing her temper as intimately as they did, they were careful to stay out of her way. Still. Roommates sucked. She could feel their eyes boring into her robe-clad back, as if they could see the name now branded there.</p><p>A-T-L-A-S.</p><p>If they dared say a single word about it... I will kill them!</p><p>There hadn\u2019t been enough cells to contain all of the Greeks, so they\u2019d been crammed into each chamber in groups. Male, female, it hadn\u2019t mattered. Maybe the Titans hadn\u2019t cared about the mixing of the sexes, or maybe they\u2019d done it to increase the torment of each prisoner. The latter was probably the case. Husbands had not been paired with wives and friend had not been paired with friend. No, rival had been paired with rival.</p><p>For her, that rival was Erebos, the minor god of Darkness. Once, Erebos had treated her like a queen. Once, she\u2019d really liked him. Had even considered marrying him. But then she\u2019d fallen in love with Atlas\u2014that womanizing, lying bastard Atlas\u2014so she\u2019d cut Erebos loose. Then she\u2019d discovered that Atlas had never really wanted her, that Atlas had only been using her.</p><p>Love had quickly morphed into rage.</p><p>The rage, though, had eventually cooled. She\u2019d forgotten him. For the most part. Liar. Now, with his name decorating her back, she hated him with every fiber of her being.</p><p>Maybe\u2014maybe\u2014she\u2019d overreacted when she\u2019d done the same to him. Branded him forever. Impulsiveness had always been her downfall. For years, she\u2019d even regretted her decision. Not that she would ever admit such a thing to him. Regret was not what she felt now, however.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t lied to him. She would kill him for this.</p><p>First, she would have to find a way to remove the stupid collar around her neck. As long as she wore it, she was powerless. The thick gold did not remove her god-given abilities, but merely muted them. Substantially. Too substantially. Second, she would have to find a way to escape this realm.</p><p>The first, in theory, should have been easy. Yet she\u2019d already tried clawing and beating at it, and had even attempted to melt it from her neck. All she\u2019d done was cut her skin, bruise her tender flesh and singe her hair off. She should have known that\u2019s what would happen. How many times had she watched Titan prisoners try the same things? The second, in theory and reality, seemed impossible.</p><p>Her gaze circled her surroundings. After the Titans had escaped, they\u2019d reinforced everything. How, she didn\u2019t know. The prison was supposedly bound to Tartarus, the Greek god of Confinement who\u2019d once kept guard over the Titans, and when he\u2019d begun to weaken for no apparent reason, the realm had weakened, as well. Everything in it became structurally unsound. But now, Tartarus was missing. The Titans didn\u2019t have him and no one knew where he was. There was no reason the realm should be as strong as it was in his absence.</p><p>The walls and floor were comprised of godly stone, something only special godly tools\u2014tools she didn\u2019t have\u2014could break through. And yet, even without Tartarus\u2019s presence, there was not a crack in sight.</p><p>The thick silver bars that allowed a glimpse of the guard\u2019s station below had been constructed by Hephaistos, and only Hephaistos could melt such a metal. Unfortunately, he resided somewhere else. As with Tartarus, no one knew where. Still, without Tartarus, she should have been able to bend that metal. She couldn\u2019t; she\u2019d already tried.</p><p>\u201cCould you settle the hell down?\u201d Erebos grumbled from one of the cots.</p><p>Nike flicked him a glance. From his dark hair to his dark skin, from his handsome features to his strong body, he was the picture of unhappy male, and all of that unhappiness was directed at her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying to plan an escape here.\u201d</p><p>They were always planning an escape.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he continued, \u201cyour ugly face is giving me a headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo suck yourself,\u201d she replied. Though she\u2019d been the one to hurt him all those centuries ago\u2014unintentionally\u2014he\u2019d repaid her a thousand times over. Purposely. Not emotionally, but physically. He liked nothing better than to \u201caccidentally\u201d trip her, bump into her and send her flying, as well as to eat what little portion of food was meant for her before she could fight her way to the front of the line, starving her.</p><p>If she hadn\u2019t been wearing the collar, he never would have been able to do those things. She would have been too strong. And he would have been too scared. Another reason to despise her captivity.</p><p>\u201cSucking myself would probably elicit better results than when you did it,\u201d he retorted.</p><p>The handful of gods and goddesses around him snickered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she said, as if the taunt didn\u2019t bother her. Except, her cheeks did flush. She was the epitome of Strength\u2014or she was supposed to be\u2014and she\u2019d always been more mannish than feminine. That was why Atlas\u2019s attentions had so surprised and delighted her. That gorgeous man could have won anyone, yet he\u2019d chosen her. Or so she\u2019d thought. And she\u2019d fallen for his act because he\u2019d somehow made her feel like a delicate, beautiful woman.</p><p>Stupid. I was so stupid.</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she saw a black-clad male stride into the guard\u2019s station. She didn\u2019t have to see him to know who it was. Atlas. She felt him. Always she felt his heat.</p> <p>When her gaze found him, she discovered that he had his arm wrapped around a leggy blonde. A blonde who cuddled herself into his side as if she belonged there\u2014and had rested there many times before.</p><p>The thought angered Nike. It shouldn\u2019t have; she despised Atlas with all of her being and didn\u2019t care who he slept with. Didn\u2019t care who he pleasured. And yes, he would have pleasured the blonde with those talented hands and seeking lips. He was an amazing lover whose touch still haunted Nike\u2019s dreams. But there it was. Anger.</p><p>She didn\u2019t mean to, but found herself striding to the bars and gripping them for a better, closer look at him. Three other guards stood around him, all talking and laughing. While prisoners wore white, guards wore black, and he wore that darkness well. It was the perfect complement to his dark, chopped hair and sea-colored eyes.</p><p>His face had been chiseled by a master artist, everything about him perfectly proportioned. His eyes were the perfect distance apart, his nose the perfect length, his cheeks the perfect sharpness, his lips the perfect shape and color and his chin a perfect, stubborn square.</p><p>He was perfect while she was nothing but flaws.</p> <p>She should have known he was playing her the moment he\u2019d turned those dangerous eyes on her and they lit with \u201cinterest.\u201d Men just didn\u2019t look at her like that. Not even Erebos had, and he had loved her.</p><p>\u201cBastard,\u201d she muttered, the curse for both the men in her past.</p><p>As if he heard her, Atlas lifted his gaze. The moment their eyes met, she wanted to release the bars. She wanted to step away, out of sight. But she didn\u2019t allow herself that luxury. That would have been cowardly, and this man had seen her weak one too many times.</p><p>Just to taunt him, and hopefully make him feel as out of control as he always made her feel, she allowed her attention to fall to his chest, exactly where her name rested. She smiled smugly before raising her gaze and arching a brow.</p><p>Score. A muscle ticked in his jaw.</p><p>What does your lover think of your mark? she wanted to shout. What does the blonde think of my name on your body?</p> <p>He jerked the stupid blonde deeper into his side and, without breaking eye contact with Nike, planted a lush, wet kiss on her mouth. Of course, the bitch reacted as any other woman would have. She wrapped her arms around him and held on for dear life. As Nike well knew, that man could make a woman come with the expertise of his kiss.</p><p>Nike\u2019s anger intensified. Had she been able, she would have stomped down there and ripped them apart. Then she would have killed them both. Not because she wanted Atlas for herself\u2014she didn\u2019t\u2014but because he was clearly using yet another woman. Passion did not glow from his expression. Only determination did.</p><p>Nike would be doing the female population a favor by snuffing him out.</p><p>\u201cErebos,\u201d she called. \u201cCome here. I want to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he gasped out, his shock clear.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a kiss or not? Get over here. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>There was a rustling of clothing behind her and then her former lover was beside her. He was a prisoner, and sex was a rarity. He would take what he could get, even from someone he loathed. That much she knew.</p><p>Nike turned to him; he was already leaning down. Like the blonde, she wrapped her arms around her companion\u2019s neck and held on tight. Only, she didn\u2019t enjoy the kiss, familiar as it was. Erebos\u2019s taste was too...what? Different from Atlas\u2019s, she realized, and that ratcheted her anger another notch. No man should have that much power over her.</p> <p>Still. She let Erebos continue. Atlas needed to realize that she no longer desired him. He needed to realize that he would never, never play her emotions again. She was not an idealistic little girl anymore.</p><p>He\u2019d made sure of that.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>RAGE. ABSOLUTE RAGE FILLED Atlas. He released his companion\u2014he couldn\u2019t recall her name\u2014and she gasped in protest at the abruptness of his actions. He didn\u2019t bother explaining what he was about as he stomped away from her. The rage continued to spread as he climbed the stairs that led to the prisoners\u2019 cages and to the cell holding Nike.</p><p>His name was on her back. How dare she allow another man to put his lips on her?</p><p>When he reached his destination, he raised his arm, and the sensor he\u2019d had embedded in his wrist caused the bars to slide open. Several prisoners were seated against the far wall. Rapturous longing colored their faces as they watched the minor god of Darkness and the goddess of Strength clean each other\u2019s tonsils. So absorbed were they, in fact, that they didn\u2019t rush Atlas and try to escape. Or maybe that had something to do with the pain they would feel if they did so. He had only to press a button, and their collars would ravage their brains.</p><p>Nike moaned, as if she really liked what was being done to her. Red flickered through Atlas\u2019s vision. How. Dare. She. Teeth grinding, he grabbed Nike by the collar of her robe and jerked her into the hard line of his body, away from Erebos.</p><p>A gasp escaped her. Unlike when the blonde had gasped, he did not remain unaffected. He wanted to swallow the sound\u2014and do something, anything, to cause Nike to make it again.</p><p>What\u2019s wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Erebos snapped, foolishly reaching for her to finish what had been started. \u201cWe were busy.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, Atlas kicked him in the chest. The smaller man flew backward, slamming into his fellow prisoners. The minor god jumped to his feet to attack, saw who had rendered the blow and stilled, nostrils flaring, hands fisting.</p><p>\u201cTouch her again,\u201d Atlas said calmly, though he was gritting the words out as if they were being pushed through a meat grinder, \u201cand I\u2019ll remove your collar. Right along with your head.\u201d</p><p>The god paled, perhaps even whimpered. \u201cI won\u2019t go near her. She wasn\u2019t worth it, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Atlas might kill him for such an insult, as well. Her kisses were heaven, damn it.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Nike demanded, suddenly coming to life and drawing his attention. She whirled on him, glaring up at him. \u201cI can sleep with whoever I want. And hey, guess what? I might even pick one of your friends. What do you think of that?\u201d</p><p>Despite her heated claims, she wasn\u2019t breathless as she would have been if Atlas had been the one kissing her, and her cheeks weren\u2019t flushed. Her nipples weren\u2019t even hard.</p><p>Finally, something cooled the hottest flames of his rage.</p><p>\u201cJust zip your mouth.\u201d He latched on to Nike\u2019s upper arm and dragged her out of the cell with him. Automatically, the bars closed behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d she said again, tugging against his hold. She\u2019d never been one to obey him.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you think you were doing?\u201d he coun tered. When he reached the bottom of the steps, he stopped. The blonde, who just happened to be the goddess of Memory\u2014damn it, what was her name? Kneemah? No, but close. Nee Nee? Closer. Mnemosyne. Yes, that was it\u2014Mnemosyne, as well as the three other warriors chosen to guard Tartarus today, were gaping at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he snapped. At least Nike stopped resisting him. She stilled at his side, attention darting from him to the others, the others to him.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just remove a prisoner,\u201d Hyperion, god of Light, said. He was a handsome man, though as pale as his title suggested, and Nike had better not be eyeing him as a possible bedmate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not removing her,\u201d Atlas replied stiffly. \u201cI\u2019m relocating her.\u201d To a cell of her own, where no one could put their dirty, disgusting lips on her. Where no one could put their roving hands on her body. There was nothing...possessive about this decision, either. He simply didn\u2019t want her experiencing any type of pleasure. She didn\u2019t deserve it.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Mnemosyne regarded him curiously, not a single thread of upset or jealousy in her expression.</p><p>Why? he wondered himself. Mnemosyne been eager to date him for months, summoning him constantly. Last night, she\u2019d even shown up at his home naked. She was beautiful, yes, and he\u2019d almost given in and slept with her. His body had been worked into a frenzy after what had transpired with Nike, after all, and he\u2019d been desperate for release. But before he sealed the deal, he\u2019d sent the determined goddess away. He\u2019d felt too guilty to continue. As if he were cheating on Nike. Which was ridiculous. The only relationship he had with Nike was one of hate.</p><p>Besides, who wanted to spend time with a female who would never forget your mistakes? A female who would remember your every transgression? A female who could spin new, false memories into your mind, making you believe whatever she wished. Not him. Yet he\u2019d flashed to Mnemosyne\u2019s home this morning and asked her to spend the day with him, just so he could bring her to the prison this morning. He\u2019d been strangely jubilant at the thought of parading her in front of Nike.</p><p>So again, he wondered why Mnemosyne did not feel as if Nike were a threat. Most females didn\u2019t, he knew. He\u2019d heard them talk. Nike was too tall, too muscled, they said. She was too hard, and too coarse. But those were the things that had first sparked his interest in her. She could handle his strength. She gave as good as she got. She would never wither under his glare. She would never run from his anger. She would always face him head-on. And he liked that. A lot. No other female he\u2019d ever encountered had that kind of courage.</p><p>And she was pretty, he thought. Yes, only yesterday he\u2019d thought her barely so, but, just now, that seemed wrong on every level. Only a short while ago, when he\u2019d first walked into the prison, he\u2019d felt her gaze on him and had looked up. For a second, only a second, her defenses had been lowered. She hadn\u2019t known he\u2019d been watching her, so she hadn\u2019t guarded her expression. An expression that had been soft, wistful, her eyes luminous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sight of her had heated his blood as if he\u2019d been caught on fire.</p><p>That still didn\u2019t mean he desired her, his enemy. The fact that his name was spelled across her back was simply playing havoc with his mind, he was sure.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Mnemosyne prompted.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Nike said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, prisoner,\u201d Mnemosyne snapped. She was sister to Rhea, the god queen, and an elitist. Always had been. She loved power and strength above all else, and viewed most people as beneath her.</p><p>He wanted to scold her for using that tone with Nike, but didn\u2019t. They were waiting for an answer to what? he wondered, thinking back over the conversation. Oh, yeah. Why was he moving Nike? He raised his chin, refusing to look down at her. Not that he would have had to look far. At six feet, she was nearly as tall as he was. \u201cI don\u2019t need a reason. I\u2019m responsible for this prison and everyone in it. Therefore, if I want to move you, I can.\u201d</p><p>The last was meant for the Titans. They would do well not to question him.</p><p>Without another word, he dragged Nike away.</p> <p>\u201cBut Atlas,\u201d Mnemosyne called.</p><p>He ignored her. Where should he take Nike? There were not many private places in this doomed structure. All of the cells were filled to capacity. That left\u2014his office, he decided.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t have that bastard slain,\u201d he said when they snaked a corner and he was sure the others couldn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>Nike didn\u2019t have to ask who \u201cthat bastard\u201d was. \u201cWhat for? He did nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>Nothing wrong? He touched what\u2019s mine. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have permission to consort with you.\u201d There. An answer to pacify. Truthful, yet misleading. Atlas snaked another corner, and there at the end of the hallway was his door.</p><p>\u201cConsort with me?\u201d She laughed without humor. \u201cOh, wait. I get it. You can screw anyone you want, but I can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Good. They were on the same page. \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d He pushed his way inside, kicked the door shut and finally released her. His hands itched to return to her, but he kept them at his sides. Rather than settle behind his desk, he faced her, placing them nose to nose. \u201cYou are to suffer in solitude.\u201d Gods, she smelled good. Like passion. Pure, white-hot passion.</p><p>\u201cAs if. I have more fun with myself, anyway.\u201d</p><p>The image those words evoked nearly sent him to his knees. He should back away from her. Before he did something foolish.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cYou haven\u2019t changed, you know. You\u2019re as much of an ass now as you were years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d he continued, as if she hadn\u2019t just insulted him. Foolishness be damned. She was here, and they were alone. \u201cIf you need to be kissed, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>And, godsdamn it, that was the absolute truth.</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>THERE WAS NO TIME to protest. In less time than it took to blink, Nike found herself smashed into the wall, Atlas pressing against her, solid chest to soft breasts, his hands pinning her temples, his mouth slamming into hers. His tongue thrust deep, without warning, forcing its way past her teeth.</p> <p>She could have bitten him. Wanted to bite him, actually, and not in affection. She wanted to draw blood, pain. Instead, her body instantly became his slave, as if centuries of hatred hadn\u2019t passed, and she welcomed him inside. She wound her arms around him and arched into his erection. Erection? Oh, yes. He was hard. Hard and long and thick. Just as she remembered.</p><p>His taste was decadent, wild and burning, like dark spices. His muscles were tensed under her palms. Up she moved them, until her fingers were tangled in his hair. The short spikes abraded deliciously, causing her to shiver.</p><p>Touch me, she wanted to shout. It had been so long, so damned long, since she\u2019d experienced this. Oh, she\u2019d been with other men since giving herself so foolishly to Atlas, because she\u2019d been searching for something as intense as what they had shared. Something to soothe her, heal her even. But each experience had left her hollow and unsatisfied. She\u2019d actually felt worse. And then she had been captured\u2014by Atlas himself\u2014and unceremoniously stuffed into this prison.</p><p>With the lack of privacy, there\u2019d been no opportunities to find companionship. Not that she would have wanted to or had even tried. No one drew her anymore. No one but Atlas, damn him.</p><p>Yes, damn him. Him. The man who had held her down only yesterday and etched his name into her flesh. What was she doing, allowing this? He would think she still cared for him. He would think she still pined for him, dreamed of him...craved him. That might be true, curse it, but she would never allow him to know it.</p><p>Panting, she tore her mouth away. How dare you stop, her body cried. \u201cI don\u2019t want you,\u201d she lied. \u201cLet me go. Now.\u201d Hold me forever.</p><p>A low growl erupted from his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t want you, either.\u201d Once, twice, he rubbed his shaft against her. \u201cBut I\u2019m not letting you go.\u201d</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Stupid body.</p><p>Tremors slid the length of her spine. Sweet heaven. He\u2019d hit her sweet spot, and sensation rocketed through her. Then one of his hands lowered and cupped her breast, and her knees almost buckled.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d The word was a mere whimper. And why was she allowing him the choice? Why wasn\u2019t she ripping away from him? You are Strength. Act like it.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t I let you go?\u201d He rolled her hardened nipple between his fingers.</p><p>That was why she remained as she was, she thought, dazed. The pleasure was building, flowing through her veins, burning her up, recreating her into a new being. Someone who lived for satisfaction alone. Someone who didn\u2019t care that the one responsible for her desire was an enemy.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...I...\u201d Those fingers tightened, stinging her a little. \u201cJust shut up and kiss me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she replied before she could stop herself.</p><p>Their mouths met again, and this time she rose on her tiptoes to meet him. As their tongues clashed and warred, he cupped her ass and lifted her feet off the floor. So strong he was. Forcing him to hold her weight would have been fun, but not nearly as pleasurable as winding her legs around his waist and pressing her needy core against his shaft.</p><p>Clever girl.</p><p>With her braced against the wall, he was able to tunnel both of his hands under her robe. Their bodies were too close together for him to reach her slick center, where she wanted him most, but having his hands on her cheeks, wanting skin against fiery skin, was almost as welcome. He was hotter than she remembered.</p><p>His lips left hers, but before she could moan her disappointment, he was kissing and licking his way down her neck.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she gasped. \u201cYes. Like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d His nose nuzzled the golden slave collar as if it were a trinket rather than a device that could kill her. For once, she even liked the collar.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d More. At the moment, that was the only word she was capable of. Unless...did he think to make her beg?</p><p>Fury suddenly blended with desire. Well, she would show him. She would beg for nothing. Not even this. Especially this. Not for him.</p><p>\u201cThen more you shall have,\u201d he said, shocking her. She had not begged, yet he was giving her what she wanted. He tugged the fabric of her robe down, revealing her breasts. Air hissed through his teeth. \u201cSo lovely. So perfect.\u201d His tongue flicked out and circled the nipple he\u2019d pinched just a short while ago. \u201cSo mine.\u201d</p><p>Her head fell back, and her nails scratched at his back. So good. The heat...the wetness...the\u2014\u201cYes!\u201d The suction. He was sucking at her so forcefully, her stomach muscles were quivering. No one else had been physically powerful enough to suit her. Their caresses had felt like whispers, barely there, utterly unsatisfying. \u201cAtlas,\u201d she groaned. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d A command, not a plea.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. I can\u2019t.\u201d He straightened, his narrowed gaze suddenly pinning her in place far more effectively than his body. \u201cI want you. All of you.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to regain her breath. Her senses. \u201cYou mean sex?\u201d Yes, yes, yes. Here, now.</p><p>A clipped nod was the only answer she received. She opened her mouth to reply, but somehow found the strength to stop herself. She drank in the sight of him\u2014a sight that delighted her almost as much as it angered her. Angered? Why? Her delight should be all-consuming. His nostrils were flared, his lips pulled tight. He looked as if he barely had himself under control. Nothing like he\u2019d looked with Mnemosyne.</p><p>He truly wants me.</p><p>But...why? she wondered. Or was he merely that good an actor?</p><p>Yes, she mused darkly. He was that good an actor. And that was where the anger sprang from. He\u2019d looked at her like that once before, the last time they\u2019d had sex. That look had been the catalyst to her decision to free him, despite the consequences to herself. Consequences that could have resulted in a death sentence. But, she\u2019d thought, he truly loves me with the same intensity that I love him. She\u2019d thought anything worth the risk of freeing him. Of possibly being with him for eternity.</p><p>How they would have managed that, she hadn\u2019t known. But she\u2019d wanted to try. He had not.</p><p>Thank the gods she\u2019d encountered one of the members of his skank parade mere minutes after escorting him from the building and into the clouds outside, where he would have been able to flash away. He\u2019d still had his collar on\u2014she hadn\u2019t wanted to remove it until they\u2019d bypassed every single guard. That way, everyone who saw them walking together would have assumed she was simply moving a prisoner.</p><p>But outside, they\u2019d been seen. No one could flash out of or into the prison itself, so everyone had to walk through the front door. Aergia, the goddess of Laziness, of all things, had decided to come to work early, surprise, surprise\u2014just to be with Atlas again. She\u2019d stopped Nike to question where he was being taken.</p><p>I\u2019m taunting him with what he can never have again, Nike had claimed.</p><p>The goddess had frowned. Well, take him to my office when you\u2019re done. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Why?</p><p>The frown became a slow, sensual smile. So I can dish my brand of...punishment to him.</p><p>Dread had sparked inside her. And how do you punish him?</p> <p>How do you think? But don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll leave him begging for more. I always do.</p><p>Atlas had tried to run then, mowing right over them both, but with his collar still in place, he hadn\u2019t gotten far. Nike had locked him back up and, suspicious, questioned all the female guards. Nearly every single one of them had had a go at him. And he\u2019d told them all the same thing: You are beautiful. I want to spend my life with you. All I need is my freedom, and I will be your slave for eternity.</p><p>So, have sex with him again? \u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me,\u201d he snapped. His grip tightened on her, his fingers digging deep, bruising. \u201cI know you do.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, she knew what this little make-out session was about. He planned to sleep with her, make her fall in love with him all over again, and then dump her. He\u2019d grind up her pride, spit it out and stomp all over it. Again. All to punish her, she was sure, for daring to tattoo him as she had. Marking her with his name clearly wasn\u2019t enough.</p> <p>\u201cWanting you dead and wanting your body aren\u2019t the same things.\u201d With a sugar-sweet grin, she patted his cheek. \u201cAnd I can promise you that while I do want the first, I was only teasing you about the second.\u201d Now who was playing who? \u201cSo...if we\u2019re done here...? I believe there is a minor god awaiting my return.\u201d</p><p>Atlas ran his tongue over his teeth. His arms fell away from her, and he stepped back. She nearly collapsed, but managed to shift her legs and absorb her own weight. Unaffected. That\u2019s how she had to appear.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re done,\u201d he said, his tone clipped. \u201cWe are definitely done.\u201d</p><p>Good, she thought. So why did she suddenly want to cry for real?</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>ATLAS HAD TO EMPTY A CELL of its seven occupants and place those gods and goddesses within other, already cramped cells to make a place for Nike. The time and effort was worth it, though. He couldn\u2019t tolerate the thought of her with that bastard Erebos, doing the same things to him that she\u2019d once done to Atlas.</p> <p>Not. Going. To. Happen.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>And maybe, perhaps, there was a slight chance it had nothing to do with punishing her and everything to do with the pleasure he\u2019d earlier denied. In her arms, he\u2019d come alive. That had happened last time, too, but he\u2019d written it off as prisoner insanity. Now, he couldn\u2019t write it off. He wasn\u2019t a prisoner; he was a warden. He\u2019d come alive, and he needed more. Of her, only her. Yet she claimed she\u2019d merely been playing him.</p><p>Fucking playing him. He wanted that to be a lie more than he wanted to take his next breath. Which he really wanted to take. He didn\u2019t understand this. She was doomed to spend eternity hidden away, which meant they could not have any kind of life together. Not even if he freed her. He would then be locked away or put to death. Unlike her, that was not something he was willing to risk.</p><p>But that she had been, all those centuries ago...it was humbling. He still could not get over the emotion.</p><p>Surely she still wanted him.</p><p>For a week, Atlas lamented his plight and pondered what to do. All the while, he stayed away from Nike\u2019s new cell. That didn\u2019t stop him from thinking about her, however. What was she doing? Did she think of him? Did she dream of him and that shattering kiss?</p><p>He did. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw the passion glowing from her face. A face that was exquisite. From barely passable, to pretty, to exquisite, all in a week\u2019s time. He shook his head in wonder. But she deserved the praise. Her lashes were long and as rich as black velvet. Velvet that framed sensual chocolate eyes. Her cheeks were smooth, perfect for caressing, and her lush, red lips were sweeter than ambrosia. And all that strength...his shaft filled and lengthened just remembering it. She\u2019d gripped and scratched him with savage abandon. He still bore the marks.</p> <p>Fine. He had lied to her. They definitely weren\u2019t done. Not even close. He had to experience that again.</p><p>Finally, he could stand the separation no longer. Thankfully, his shift was over. A shift that had consisted of walking the prison halls, watching the prisoners inside their cells and ensuring everyone remained calm.</p><p>That should have bored him. After all, he was a warrior. But bore him it didn\u2019t. And that should have irritated him. After all, he\u2019d spent countless centuries in this place and had sworn never to return once he\u2019d escaped. But again, irritation was not what he felt. He\u2019d wanted this job to be close to Nike. To have his vengeance, he\u2019d once told himself. Now, he wasn\u2019t so sure. Today, and all week really, he\u2019d walked the halls invigorated, knowing all he had to do to catch sight of her was turn a corner.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t allowed himself to do so. Until now. Finally, he would see her.</p><p>The moment she came into view, his blood heated, blistering. His breath followed suit, flaming his lungs to ash. She sat atop her cot, arms gripping the rail, knees drawn up while she leaned slightly forward. Her hair was finger-combed to perfection, and her eyes were narrowed, shielding her irises and the emotion banked there, but at least he could see the shadows her lashes cast over her cheeks. Shadows he might trace with a fingertip. Or his tongue.</p><p>Oh, yes. She was exquisite.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your girlfriend?\u201d Her voice was smooth as silk. Just beneath that silk, however, he thought he caught a tendril of fury.</p><p>Was she mad that he\u2019d come? Or mad that he\u2019d stayed away so long?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a girlfriend.\u201d Though Mnemosyne was still trying to change that.</p><p>Even though he pushed her away every damn time.</p><p>Nike shrugged. \u201cToo bad for you that whores never commit.\u201d</p><p>He knew he was the whore that she spoke of, and popped his jaw. But he deserved that, he supposed. \u201cI did what I had to do to escape, Nike. That doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t feel\u2014\u201d No. Oh, no. He would not go down that road. He hadn\u2019t wanted to feel anything for her, but he had. That hadn\u2019t stopped him from using her, so she\u2019d never like what he had to say about the matter. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019d do anything to escape, as well.\u201d</p><p>Her expression darkened, but she did not refute his words. \u201cSo, did you come to free me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here? We have nothing more to say to each other.\u201d</p><p>Because you\u2019re all I think about anymore. He never should have marked her. This might have been avoided. Or not. He might have slept with others all those years ago because he\u2019d been desperate to flee this place, but it had been her face he\u2019d imagined when he\u2019d done so.</p><p>Without looking away from her, he leaned back against the bar behind him and crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty to say. About the kiss.\u201d</p><p>She yawned, patting her beautiful mouth. A mouth he wanted all over his body. \u201cI\u2019d rather sleep.\u201d</p><p>So. She still wanted him to think she had been unaffected. Part of him believed it. An insecure part of him that had never really known how to deal with her, his equal in every way. Yes, even strength, though he often liked to deny it. The other part of him, the masculine part, knew she had liked everything he\u2019d done. She\u2019d shouted his name, for gods\u2019 sake, and he hadn\u2019t even made her climax.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying you don\u2019t want me?\u201d he asked as silkily as she had.</p><p>\u201cNot even a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He rested his fingers at the waist of his pants, twisting the button, and her eyes followed the movement. His cock was already hard, already straining, rising over the top. Moisture glistened there. \u201cNot even a tiny, tiny bit?\u201d</p><p>She gulped. \u201cN-no.\u201d The word was croaked. \u201cBut you are. Tiny, that is.\u201d</p><p>Liar. She did. She wanted him. And he was huge, thank you very much. He stretched her. The sense of possessiveness returned, all the more intense because it was joined by satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you yet, Nike. That I promise you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...go away,\u201d she said, suddenly sounding almost...dejected. She eased to her side, then rolled to her back, facing away from him. \u201cWe\u2019re done with each other. Remember?\u201d</p><p>Wrong move. Seeing her back, even covered by that baggy robe, reminded him of what he\u2019d done and that set fire to his blood anew. Whatever he had to do, he was going to have this woman.</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019ll find out,\u201d he told her before walking away.</p><p>To think. To plan.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>ATLAS PUSHED PAST the double doors that led into Cronus\u2019s throne room. Armed guards, immortal warriors Cronus himself had created, were stationed along the edges of the walls. Each held a spear, and swords swung from the sheaths at their waists. They stood at attention, waiting for an order or a threat. They would spring into action for both.</p><p>Of course, there were also warriors lining both sides of the purple lamb\u2019s fleece carpet that led to the bejeweled dais, crowding Atlas as he made his way forward. His weapons had already been removed, but they were taking no chances, eyeing his every movement with distrust.</p><p>He wondered if, when she had been a free woman, Nike had ever been summoned to this room, albeit to meet with Zeus, her king. And if she had, had it been for a reward or a punishment?</p><p>Stop thinking about her. Concentrate on Cronus. He\u2019s wily, that one. The god king was not the same man he\u2019d been before his incarceration. The thousands of years inside Tartarus had changed him; he was harder, harsher. Utterly unforgiving. Any weakness, he pounced upon.</p><p>Nowadays, Cronus refused to stay in the heavens without an army to shield him. But then, a man at war with his own wife couldn\u2019t be too careful. Especially when that wife was a queen with powerful abilities and allies of her own. A wife who\u2014</p><p>Dizziness spun through Atlas\u2019s head, fragmenting his thoughts, and he frowned. Frowned but didn\u2019t stop until he reached the end of the fleece. He kept his attention, foggy as it was, fixed on Cronus. What was wrong with him? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The king was seated atop a throne of solid gold. Dark strands were threaded through his silver hair, and his beard had thinned since the last time Atlas had seen him. Some of the age lines had even disappeared from his weathered features. He wore a long white robe, much like the prisoners of Tartarus. Why? Atlas had often wondered.</p><p>Only two explanations made any sense. Cronus had worn the garment for centuries and now felt most comfortable in it. Or he did not want to forget what he\u2019d once been\u2014and could be again if he weren\u2019t careful. Atlas had been more than happy to shed his own robe. Would Nike do the same, if ever she gained her freedom? Not that she would.</p><p>You\u2019re thinking about her again.</p><p>A woman stood beside the throne. She possessed one of the plainest faces Atlas had ever seen, and had pale, freckled skin. She was reed thin, with dark, curling hair and delicate shoulders. Power did not hum from her. Rather, she seemed...insubstantial. Ethereal, as he imagined a ghost might look. There, but see-through. There, but wavering. Her eyes were shadowy, vacant, as if no one was home.</p> <p>When she reached up and brushed a lock of hair from her brow, he could only gape. The elegance of the movement was awe inspiring. More graceful than a dancer, more delicate than a butterfly wing. Someone was indeed home, she just didn\u2019t care about what was happening around her.</p><p>Atlas pulled his attention from the female and studied the chamber. There were thousands of chandeliers overhead, each dripping with glistening teardrops. Multihued glitter sparkled in the air. Odd, he thought, head tilting to the side for a better view. That air was even sweetly scented with\u2014he inhaled deeply\u2014ambrosia. Ah. Now he understood the dizziness and the glitter. Dried ambrosia was being pumped through the room. To keep him docile?</p><p>\u201cAtlas, god of Strength,\u201d Cronus said with a nod of greeting, drawing him from his musings.</p><p>Atlas bowed, as was proper. \u201cMy king. It\u2019s an honor to have this audience with you.\u201d</p><p>Cronus leaned forward, silver eyes bright with anxiety. \u201cAll is well in Tartarus, yes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMost assuredly.\u201d</p><p>Relief instantly replaced the anxiety. \u201cWhy, then, did you request this meeting?\u201d</p><p>There was no one who hated the Greeks more than this man, this Titan sovereign, and with very good reason. They\u2019d stripped him of his power, humiliated him in front of his people. Even Nike had been a participant.</p><p>Just tell him. Get this over with. \u201cI want to remove a woman from the prison and set her up\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Stop there.\u201d Scowling, Cronus raised a hand. \u201cThere will be no removing anyone from Tartarus. It is too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d expected that answer. However, he persevered. \u201cPerhaps the reward is worth the danger. I would keep her locked inside my home, Majesty. I would never remove her collar\u2014\u201d well, except to whisk her to his home, for she couldn\u2019t be flashed out of Tartarus with it on, but he would recollar her the moment they reached their destination \u201c\u2014and she would be my personal slave. I would ensure her misery.\u201d His first lie of the day, but probably not his last. He only wanted to give Nike pleasure.</p> <p>Had he forgiven her for what she\u2019d done to him? He wasn\u2019t sure. All he knew was that he no longer wanted to kill her when he thought about it. He would tire of her eventually, and he looked forward to the day. Until then, this was his only recourse.</p><p>The king ran his tongue over his teeth. \u201cOf which her do you speak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNike. Greek goddess of Strength.\u201d He did not allow a single bit of affection to lace his tone.</p><p>The king\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThe one who...\u201d Now those eyes dropped to Atlas\u2019s chest, where his shirt covered his tattoos.</p><p>\u201cYes. The very one.\u201d Hear my anger, only my anger. Except, what she\u2019d done no longer angered him. The marks were as much a part of him now as his were a part of her.</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d Cronus leaned back in the throne, the picture of contemplation. \u201cDo you not think she is being made to suffer enough inside Tartarus?\u201d</p><p>Time for his second lie. \u201cNo. I do not.\u201d In truth, as dejected as she\u2019d sounded at their last meeting, the goddess was suffering. And he didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cAnd what will you do to increase her suffering?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMuch as she hates me\u2014\u201d desires me, he added inside his head, so that he wouldn\u2019t reveal the depths of irritation thoughts of her possible loathing elicited \u201c\u2014she will take particular displeasure in cleaning my home, preparing my food and warming my bed.\u201d</p><p>The king smiled up at the ghostly girl. \u201cWhat you\u2019d like to do to your Paris, eh, my Sienna? Make him your slave.\u201d</p><p>Her expression never changed. She offered no response, either.</p><p>Paris, the demon-possessed immortal who used to haul new prisoners into Tartarus? Atlas wondered, and then shrugged. He didn\u2019t care. Nike was his only concern at the moment.</p><p>\u201cMy king?\u201d Atlas prompted. \u201cI lack only your permission to begin Nike\u2019s torment. My determination is unparalleled. You will not be disappointed in the results.\u201d</p><p>Cronus faced him once again, his smile falling away. A minute passed in silence, then another. Then the king sighed. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my answer has to be no. While I like the thought of Nike\u2019s anguish intensified at your hands, I\u2019m unwilling to risk the removal of her collar, even for the few seconds required to flash her. She is Strength, and were she to somehow escape you and free her brethren, another heavenly war would erupt. I cannot afford to have my attention divided now. Well, not any more than it already is. I find I spend most of my time observing the Lords of the Underworld.\u201d</p><p>The Lords of the Underworld. So. The girl named Sienna did wish to enslave the immortal Paris. Atlas had never dealt with the man or any of his friends, as they\u2019d been his enemy and he\u2019d already been incarcerated before Zeus created them.</p><p>But he\u2019d heard stories and knew they were vicious...brutal.</p><p>\u201cMy king. If you will just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have declared my answer, Strength. I do not understand why you are still here.\u201d</p><p>Atlas\u2019s own sense of dejection\u2014and fury\u2014bloomed. He wanted to stalk up that dais, grab the king and shake him. How dare his request be denied? How dare his desires be discarded? Instead, he said, \u201cVery well, my king. I thank you for your time,\u201d and pivoted on his heel. To do otherwise would have invited punishment.</p><p>He strode from the chamber, his determination overshadowing all else. He\u2019d already decided that nothing would keep him from claiming Nike. Now he realized that not even this would do so. The king\u2019s will be damned. He would have his woman, just as he wanted.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>\u201cCOME WITH ME.\u201d</p><p>Nike\u2019s heart raced at the sound of that deep voice. Hesitant, she rolled over on her cot. Sure enough, her skin tingled when her gaze found Atlas. Gorgeous as ever, he stood at the bars\u2014bars that were now open. His hand was extended, and he was waving her over. There was fury in his too-tight expression.</p><p>What had she done this time?</p><p>She\u2019d tried to ignore him. She\u2019d tried to pretend that she felt nothing for him. Anything to stop the madness. But gods, she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about their kiss. She couldn\u2019t stop wishing she\u2019d allowed him to take her all the way. That she\u2019d have experienced everything before being taken back to nothing.</p><p>So what if he would have tired of her afterward? So what if he would have been smug about her capitulation? So what if he found someone else and paraded her before Nike? For a few blessed hours\u2014who was she kidding?\u2014for a few blessed minutes, because it wasn\u2019t as if either one of them would last beyond that, she would have known the joy of being with him again. Of simply feeling, giving, taking, sharing...loving.</p><p>Have all the rest, common sense piped up, but deny the love.</p><p>That would be my pleasure. But I have to get him to offer me the rest first. She still would not beg. A girl had her pride, after all.</p><p>Pride will not make you come.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>What did he have planned? Did it matter? Anything was better than this monotony.</p><p>Slowly she sat up. Her hair was in desperate need of a brush, and gods, the rest of her needed a shower. How long since she\u2019d had one? Prisoners were given a bowl of water each day and that was it.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>A muscle twitched in his jaw. \u201cDo you want to spend a few hours outside the prison or not?\u201d</p><p>Wait. What? Leave Tartarus? She was on her feet before her brain could process what she was doing. Her knees almost buckled, she\u2019d spent so much time prone, bored, but she managed to stay upright. She even reached out and twined their fingers together. The heat of his skin should not have shocked her, but it did. The calluses should not have ignited a fire in her blood, but they did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking me outside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But do not say a word when we reach the guard\u2019s station. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d This could be a trick. A trick to build up her hopes only to dash them cruelly, but she didn\u2019t care. If there was a chance, slight though it was, that he would actually stay true to his word, she would do anything he asked.</p><p>Without a word, he led her from the cell and down the hall. Other prisoners spotted her and gasped. Some began to murmur amongst themselves, gossiping as they\u2019d once enjoyed doing in the heavens. Some gripped their bars and simply watched her through wistful eyes.</p><p>Erebos even shouted, \u201cHey, where are you going with her now?\u201d</p><p>Atlas ignored him, and Nike followed suit. A sense of urgency pounded through her. If Atlas did this, took her outside, even for a few hours... Why would he do such a thing?</p><p>\u201cDid you get permission for this?\u201d she asked. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not at the guard\u2019s station yet, so it\u2019s okay that I\u2019m talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t get permission.\u201d His words were curt, clearly meant to end the conversation.</p><p>As if she\u2019d ever done what was expected of her. \u201cThen why are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust be quiet.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I\u2019ll shut you up my favorite way.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. Did he mean he\u2019d shut her up with a kiss? Or by pushing a button on her collar and shooting painful lances through her brain? It was fifty-fifty, she thought. His proclamation had the desired results, however. She was too busy pondering his meaning to talk.</p> <p>In the guard\u2019s station, two Titans were laughingly making bets about the prisoners. They looked up at Atlas and nodded politely in greeting\u2014only to freeze when they spotted her. As promised, she remained quiet.</p><p>\u201cShe try to escape?\u201d one demanded, obviously ready to beat her for doing so.</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m taking her out for a bit,\u201d Atlas replied.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d the other gasped out. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer viper\u2019s tongue offends me. Therefore, she deserves a new punishment. To that end, I plan to taunt her with what she cannot have.\u201d</p> <p>The very words she\u2019d once offered Aergia, the goddess of Laziness. He\u2019d remembered.</p><p>Still the guard persisted. \u201cHas this been cleared with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in charge of this prison and the people inside it. Now shut up and do your job.\u201d With that, Atlas ushered her out of the building and into the daylight. No one else tried to stop him.</p><p>As the first ray hit her skin, she jerked free of his hold and stopped, simply basking in the moment. Clouds. Sun. She closed her eyes, head thrown back, arms splayed. The warmth, followed by a cooling breeze...the brightness\u2014her skin soaked them up greedily. Oh, how she\u2019d missed them. She would have loved to have seen temples and golden streets and people, as well, but she would take what she could get without complaint.</p><p>Strong arms suddenly banded around her. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Atlas whispered, his nose nuzzling her ear, practically purring. \u201cDo you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I look like.\u201d Her lashes fluttered open. The clouds enveloped him, creating a dream haze. Her heart was hammering against her ribs, and she couldn\u2019t have stopped herself from flattening her hands on his chest to save her life. His own heart was racing, she realized with astonishment. Was he...could he be as affected by her as she was by him? \u201cAnd beautiful is not a word that describes me.\u201d</p> <p>His head lifted, and he gazed down at her. Tenderness softened his expression, and she thought he\u2019d never been more appealing. \u201cThen you don\u2019t see yourself as I do.\u201d</p><p>How did he see her? As much as he hated her\u2014but did he hate her still? How could he, when he\u2019d just escorted her to paradise?\u2014she would have guessed he pictured her with horns, fangs and a tail.</p><p>She cleared her throat, too afraid to ask. \u201cWhy did you do this for me?\u201d A much easier question, with an answer that probably wouldn\u2019t destroy what little was left of her feminine pride.</p><p>\u201cI have my reasons,\u201d was all he said. \u201cNow, as much as I\u2019d love to stay in this exact spot with you, we only have a short amount of time. Do you want to spend it here or eating the food I\u2019ve prepared, as well as bathing? I know those are the two things I missed most during my tenure here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat...eating. Bathing.\u201d Was this really happening? Or was she merely dreaming about him again? Nothing else explained this change in him, in her situation.</p><p>He kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cThen food and a bath you shall have. Come. Since I can\u2019t flash you outside of this realm, and there are no homes, inns or shops here, I\u2019ve set up camp a mile north, out of view of the prison.\u201d</p><p>Dreaming, surely. Perhaps a trick, as she\u2019d first supposed. But she allowed him to lead her through the clouds without protest.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p> <p>BY THE TIME THEY REACHED the camp he\u2019d set up, Atlas was hard and aching. Nike had been pressed against his side the entire mile, her female scent in his nose, her heat radiating into his body.</p><p>When she spied the tent he\u2019d erected, she gasped. Wide brown eyes flicked up to him with wonder before she raced forward, not slowing as she barreled through the front flap. He heard another gasp.</p><p>Grinning, Atlas followed her inside. He liked this softer side of her. She stood in the center, twirling, clearly trying to take everything in at once. He\u2019d spread furs on the floor and had even carted a small round table here and piled it high with her favorite foods. There was a porcelain tub already filled with steaming water, rose petals floating on the surface.</p><p>Never let it be said that the Titan god of Strength did not know how to romance a woman.</p><p>Nike\u2019s hand fluttered over her heart, her gaze glued to the plate of strawberries and feta. \u201cHow did you know I liked those?\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d always been hyperaware of her every action. He\u2019d watched her from his cell while she\u2019d eaten them with her friends and he\u2019d fumed that he was not the one with her, basking in her good humor. That was not something he\u2019d admit to, however.</p><p>\u201cGood guess,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>She peered down at the rug and kicked out her bare, dirty foot. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re doing this, Atlas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us,\u201d he replied gruffly.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust enjoy it, Nike. It\u2019s all I can give you.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes fluttered up, and her gaze pinned him. \u201cBut why would you want to give me anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop analyzing my reasons. This isn\u2019t a ploy or a punishment, I promise you. And the food is not poisoned, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d He closed the distance between them, placed his hands on her shoulders and urged her to the table.</p><p>There, they ate in silence. The rapture on her face, rapture that increased with every bite, delighted him. The wine she savored sip by sip, moaning with every swallow.</p><p>Bringing her here was worth the risk of Cronus\u2019s wrath, he thought.</p><p>Although, to get technical, Cronus had merely ordered him to keep her in Tartarus. Which he had done. The clouds around the prison were part of the realm. So really, he had not broken any rules. Cronus, though, being Cronus, would not see it that way.</p><p>Still, Atlas couldn\u2019t regret it. He had never seen this joyful, eager side of the Greek goddess, and he found that he liked it just as much as he liked everything else about her. Which was way more than he should have.</p><p>When every crumb had been consumed, she turned her attention to the bath. \u201cThat\u2019s for me?\u201d Utter longing radiated from her, yet she didn\u2019t move toward it.</p><p>\u201cYes. But I can\u2019t leave you. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>She chewed on her bottom lip and nodded. \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is, I can bathe with you watching or not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>He expected her to fight him on that. Hell, she could have refused outright. What he did not expect was for her to push to her feet and discard her robe without hesitation. At the sight of her nakedness, he hissed in a breath. Already he\u2019d thought her exquisite...but now, now...holy gods. She was the finest creature the gods had ever produced.</p><p>Her skin, so golden and smooth, covered lean muscle and succulent breasts. Those breasts were soft, perfect for his hands, and her nipples were as pretty a pink as he remembered. His mouth watered for them.</p><p>She walked to the tub and stepped inside. Her ass, her back...his name. He was on his feet before he realized what he\u2019d done. He wanted to kiss those tattoos, something she would probably fight him over. He wouldn\u2019t apologize for having given them to her, though. Hell, no. He liked them too much.</p><p>Nike pivoted slowly, and her gaze met his as she sank into the water. There was no hiding the desire he felt\u2014it consumed him, ate him up and left him as bare as she was. Her expression, however, was blank.</p><p>Slowly, she worked the bar of soap he\u2019d brought her over her entire body. She seemed completely unabashed as the suds danced over her, sliding down those magnificent breasts hiding beneath the rose petals. She washed her hair, too, and soon the locks were dripping down her face and shoulders.</p><p>With every move she made, he inched a little closer to her. He just couldn\u2019t help himself. Finally she finished and stood. Another feast for his eyes. All the strength he craved more than anything else in the world was now wet, and he wanted to lick away every drop.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d she asked, stepping from the tub. Her voice was as devoid of emotion as her expression. Why?</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d he managed to croak past the lump in his throat.</p><p>Finally. A reaction. Relief and desire, such intense desire, claimed her, and she grinned a siren\u2019s smile. \u201cThen have me you shall.\u201d</p><p>They were a mimic of his earlier words, and completely unexpected. Why the change in her? Doesn\u2019t matter. As he\u2019d told her earlier, there was no good reason to analyze a change of heart. Not in either of them. Not now.</p><p>He had the distance between them defeated a split second later. Had his arms wrapped around her, jerking her into him, a second after that. Their lips met in a wild tangle, their tongues seeking, rolling together. On and on the kiss continued, drowning him in all that she was.</p><p>He hated to stop, even for a moment, but he had to remove his clothes. If he didn\u2019t experience skin-to-skin contact soon, he was going to ignite into flames. Panting, he tore away his shirt, his boots, then his pants.</p><p>She moaned. \u201cAtlas.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her back into his embrace. Finally. Blessedly. Skin to skin. Both of them groaned at the headiness. Her nipples rubbed against his chest, his tattoos, while their lower bodies thrust together. Then she was bending down, tracing those letters with her tongue\u2014and gods, he had never been happier that he had them.</p><p>After she\u2019d traced the last one, she kissed her way down his stomach. She dropped to her knees.</p><p>Was she going to...please, please, please...but she didn\u2019t like him enough to do it. Did she? \u201cWhat are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She sucked his cock deep into her mouth.</p><p>His head fell back, and he roared. All that wet heat was ecstasy, surely the first he\u2019d ever truly known, for nothing had ever felt this damned good. Except her, that first time he claimed her. Up and down she moved, allowing him to hit the back of her throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGods! Don\u2019t make me come.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, pulled off and licked his sac. \u201cWhen have I ever listened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVixen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t I make you come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want inside you.\u201d With a growl, he dropped to his knees, as well. She could taste his seed. Later. He hadn\u2019t lied to her. More than anything, even more of that ecstasy, he wanted inside her, and he didn\u2019t want to have to wait for it. \u201cSpread your legs for me.\u201d</p><p>The moment she obeyed, he had two fingers buried deep. More wet heat. And to his delight...\u201cYou\u2019re ready for me.\u201d Never had he been more proud that he\u2019d brought a female to this point. And that he\u2019d done so with kisses, only kisses....</p><p>She trembled, had to grip his shoulders to remain upright. \u201cI\u2019m ready for you every damn time I see you.\u201d</p><p>And she didn\u2019t like it, he could tell from her tone, but he could only bask in the admission. \u201cIt\u2019s the same for me.\u201d</p> <p>At first, she blinked, as if she couldn\u2019t allow herself to believe him. So vulnerable she appeared, so\u2014dare he wish?\u2014hopeful. Then she placed a sweet kiss on his lips and breathed him in. \u201cDon\u2019t say things like that,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I spoke true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause they affect me.\u201d</p><p>Headier words had never been spoken. \u201cLet\u2019s finish this before I combust, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>He was sweating, panting, as he settled back on his ass, reached out and cupped hers. He jerked her onto his lap, forcing her to wrap her thighs around his waist. As her hands tangled in his hair, he lifted her, placing her eager core at the tip of his erection.</p> <p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked hoarsely. This was it. The moment he felt he\u2019d been waiting forever for.</p><p>\u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>He thrust up and she pushed down, and then he was all the way in, surrounded by the very thing he had defied his king, his sovereign, to possess. It was better than he remembered, better than he could have imagined. He couldn\u2019t pause, couldn\u2019t give her time to adjust. Over and over he pushed in, pulled out, too overwhelmed by pleasure to do anything but ride out the storm. Perhaps it was the same for her. Her nails scored his back, and her moans rang in his ears.</p><p>Gods, he was close. On fire. Burning. Desperate. He reached between their bodies and pressed his thumb against his new favorite place.</p><p>\u201cAtlas,\u201d she shouted, her inner walls suddenly milking him.</p><p>She was climaxing, lost to all that he was, and the thought drove him over the last bit of the edge, as well. He jetted inside her, lost to all that she was, the most intense orgasm of his life claiming him.</p><p>An eternity later, his spasms stopped. Together, they fell backward, onto the softness of the fur. He kept his arms around her, unwilling to let her go. Now...always?</p><p>Yes, always, he thought, and his eyes widened. He wanted her always. Wanted more of this. Had to have more of this. When he\u2019d forgiven her completely, he didn\u2019t know. When he\u2019d softened, he didn\u2019t know, either. He only knew that she\u2019d become an important part of his life. Perhaps she always had been; he\u2019d just been too foolish to realize it.</p> <p>What the hell was he going to do?</p><p>They could be together each night after his shift, but they\u2019d never have privacy, and her pride would soon chafe at his amorous attentions, all while he refused to set her free. It would have been the same for him when the situation had been reversed. Besides, she was too precious to hurt in that way. But the problem was, he couldn\u2019t be without her. He\u2019d proven that already.</p><p>Damn, he thought next, suddenly sick to his stomach. Damn!</p><p>He\u2019d finally found the one woman for him, but they were doomed.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>SHE LOVED HIM, N IKE THOUGHT. Again. I\u2019m hopeless.</p><p>He\u2019d just...he\u2019d been so amazing. He\u2019d whisked her away, given her everything she\u2019d craved: food, water and his body. Gods, had he given her that delectable body. She\u2019d savored every moment. Savored his taste, his touch, the feel of him pounding inside her.</p><p>Four days had since passed, but she craved more. Always she craved more. She\u2019d spent the time locked inside her cell, pacing, trying to think of ways for them to be together. If he still wanted her, that is. Atlas had come by at least once a day to make sure she was properly fed and that her basin of water was filled, but he\u2019d never said a word to her. Actually, they hadn\u2019t spoken since leaving the tent.</p><p>At the time, she\u2019d felt too raw, too exposed. She\u2019d feared her feelings for him had been shining in her eyes. He was everything she\u2019d ever wanted in a mate. His strength matched hers. She would never have to worry about hurting him. He was witty and charming. He was a protector, a warrior. He was deliciously vengeful, she knew firsthand.</p><p>She smiled, wishing she could reach between her shoulder blades and feel his name. She was certain the letters would be as hot as the man himself. But...</p><p>Why hadn\u2019t he spoken to her?</p><p>Why didn\u2019t you speak to him?</p><p>Because she hadn\u2019t known what to say. Did he still want her? Did he feel anything for her? How would she react if he didn\u2019t, which was most likely the case? Part of her wanted to take anything he would give her. The other part of her knew her pride wouldn\u2019t allow her to do such a thing. But there at the end, when they\u2019d returned to Tartarus and he\u2019d closed the bars to her cell, she had thought she\u2019d glimpsed regret. Regret that he had to seal her inside. Regret that they couldn\u2019t spend more time together\u2014in bed and out.</p><p>Nike tugged at her collar and screeched. Damn this. She was the epitome of strength, yet was as helpless as a babe. How could she win a man\u2019s heart when she couldn\u2019t even win her own freedom?</p><p>ATLAS HEARD A SCREECH of frustration and knew immediately who had uttered it. Nike. His Nike. His beautiful Nike. He\u2019d deliberated about what to do, how they could be together, for four days. Well, the time for thinking was over, it seemed. She was close to her breaking point. She\u2019d tasted freedom; being sequestered now had to be a thousand times worse than before.</p><p>He hated that she was locked up, and he knew they could never be together while she was. He also knew they could not be together if he released her. She would most likely run, and he would most definitely be punished.</p><p>Maybe she loved him, maybe she didn\u2019t. Maybe she\u2019d stay with him. Or try to. She liked him and was attracted to him, he would go so far as to say. After everything that had transpired between them, she wouldn\u2019t have slept with him otherwise. But love? He wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>And it didn\u2019t matter, really. He loved her. Perhaps he always had. He\u2019d never felt so strongly about a woman. He\u2019d never wanted to spend his every waking minute with someone before, had never wanted to cuddle someone into his side for every sleeping minute. He\u2019d never wanted to eat every meal together. To talk and laugh about their days. To spar, verbally and physically. But he did with her.</p><p>And since they couldn\u2019t be together, no matter what way things panned out, there was only one thing to do.</p><p>Dread. That\u2019s what he felt as he pounded up the stairs and to her cell. Also...relief. She was banging a fist into the wall, plumes of dust forming around her. The sight of her nearly undid him. He wanted to kiss her, put his fingers all over her, sink inside her. Harden your heart. Do what is needed. His hand was shaking as he lifted the sensor.</p><p>She heard the slide of the bars and turned. A gasp parted her beautiful lips. Without a word, he held out his palm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take it.\u201d</p><p>She frowned as she accepted.</p><p>Still silent, he pulled her along the same path he had just taken. The same path they\u2019d taken those four days ago. No one tried to stop him this time. In fact, as he passed the guard\u2019s station, the two gods on duty rolled their eyes.</p><p>Outside, with the clouds all around him, he whirled on Nike. He still wanted to kiss her, but knew that if he did so, he would not be able to let her go. And he had to let her go.</p><p>\u201cAtlas,\u201d she said with a seductive grin. She tried to wrap her arms around his neck. \u201cAnother outing? I\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and placed his fingers on the designated indentations in the collar. Cool metal met his touch. Then he leaned down and fit his lips over the center.</p><p>Her grin fell away. A tremor moved through her. \u201cWh-what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe still.\u201d He drew in a deep breath, held it...held it...and then slowly released it. As that breath slithered through the inside of the collar, the metal loosened...finally splitting down the center and tumbling to the ground. Such a simple thing, the removal. Touch and breath. Yet only an uncollared god could do so, a fact that had to taunt the incarcerated. Perhaps that\u2019s why the bands had been designed as they had.</p><p>Eyes wide, she reached up, felt her bare neck. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. They were the same words she\u2019d spoken before. He hadn\u2019t had an answer then. He did now. He loved her, but he could never tell her that.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d he said. \u201cFlash somewhere. Maybe earth. And whatever you do, stay hidden. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAtlas...no.\u201d She shook her head violently, even fisted his shirt. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. When they discover I\u2019m gone for good, and they will, you\u2019ll be charged with a crime. You\u2019ll be locked away, placed with the Greeks who hate you. Or, if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll be killed.\u201d</p><p>She felt, he realized, both amazed and saddened. She cared for him, which meant she would suffer without him. If anything, that only increased his determination to save her. She did not deserve a life behind bars.</p><p>He forced his expression to harden. Forced himself to jerk away from her. \u201cI can\u2019t stand to look at you anymore. I\u2019ve had you, and now I\u2019m bored with you.\u201d</p><p>Her arms dropped to her sides as if weighed down by rocks, but she quickly pulled them around her middle. \u201cThen keep me locked up and stay away from me. You don\u2019t want to do this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Still willing to give up her freedom to be near him? Damn her. He fell a little more in love with her. \u201cGo! Did you not hear me? I can\u2019t stand the sight of you anymore. Don\u2019t you get it? You make me sick, Nike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Tears filled her eyes. Real godsdamned tears. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that. You can\u2019t mean that.\u201d The last was whispered brokenly.</p><p>His heart constricted painfully. Do it. Finish it. \u201cI\u2019d rather be killed or locked away than look at you another moment. Because every time I look at you, I\u2019m reminded of what we did and I\u2014I want to vomit. I was using you, wanting to punish you, but I took things too far. Even for me.\u201d Hating himself, he turned away from her. \u201cSo do us both a favor and go.\u201d</p> <p>For a long while, she didn\u2019t speak. He knew she didn\u2019t flash away, either, for he heard no rustle of clothing. But then, he did hear a whimper. A sob. More of those tears must be falling.</p><p>Gods, he couldn\u2019t do it. He couldn\u2019t send her away like this. He spun, meaning to grab on to her and tell her the truth, to force her to listen. To make her leave another way. But she was gone before their eyes could meet and his hands encountered only air.</p><p>\u201cYOU INSOLENT FOOL!\u201d</p><p>Atlas peered up at the fuming Cronus. Not like he could do anything else. His wrists were chained to poles, forcing him to remain on his knees. The very collar he\u2019d removed from Nike was now wrapped around his own neck.</p><p>He\u2019d known this would happen, but he hadn\u2019t cared. He still didn\u2019t. Nike was free, and that was all that mattered.</p> <p>\u201cHave you nothing to say for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne Greek can raise an army. That army can attack us. Ruin us. I told you that, and still you defied me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNike won\u2019t do that,\u201d he said confidently. He trusted her to disappear. Even as angry as she had to be with him, she would not endanger herself to save people she had never truly liked.</p><p>Cronus slammed his fist against the arm of his throne, ever the petulant child. \u201cYou can\u2019t know that! You aren\u2019t my All-Seeing Eye.\u201d</p><p>Atlas arched a brow, refusing to be cowed. \u201cWould you risk being imprisoned again to help your fellow Titans? I may not be able to see all the secrets of the heavens and Hell, yet I know you would not. She will not, either.\u201d</p> <p>The king had no response to that, but that didn\u2019t stop him from growling. \u201cYou disobeyed a direct order, and for that you will be punished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d He offered the statement without hesitation. It was the truth. He understood that the god king had to make an example out of him. Otherwise, others would see Cronus as weak. They would disobey him as Atlas had.</p><p>\u201cI think you actually do.\u201d Some of Cronus\u2019s fury abated. \u201cOnly this morning I saw a portrait of you. A portrait painted by my Eye. With it, she showed me exactly how to punish you.\u201d The king smiled evilly and looked to the ghostlike girl still standing at his side. \u201cYou know what to do, sweet Sienna.\u201d</p><p>Sienna strode forward, a knife appearing in her hand. She stopped in front of Atlas and dropped to her knees, placing them eye to eye. So this was it, he thought. The end. As an immortal, he\u2019d never thought to reach this point. Still. He found he only regretted that he hadn\u2019t had more time with Nike, that he hadn\u2019t gotten the chance to apologize for his harsh words the last time they were together and that he would never have the chance to confess his love.</p><p>With absolutely no emotion on her face, the girl dug the tip of the blade into his wrist and cut out his sensor, rather than chop off his head. That\u2019s when he realized Cronus meant to lock him away rather than kill him. Good. More time to think about Nike and what could have been.</p><p>But then Sienna moved the blade to his chest and pressed, slicing. It stung, but that was not what made him struggle against her ministrations. No, it was the fact that she began carving away Nike\u2019s name. He roared loud and long, fighting for all he was worth. Guards were called over and hard hands settled over him, pressing him down, holding him steady. Still he fought, but in the end, they managed to remove all four letters.</p><p>As each person walked away from him, he glanced down at himself through burning, watery eyes. Blood poured down his chest and four open wounds stared up at him, the muscles torn, the skin completely gone. He might have hated that brand at one point in his life, but he\u2019d grown to love it as much as the woman who\u2019d given it to him. More than that, it had been the last remaining evidence of her presence.</p><p>His hands fisted, and his back straightened. Blood and sweat mingled, stinging further. Another roar burst from his lips, and he tossed it to the domed ceiling. He didn\u2019t stop until his throat was shredded from the strain.</p> <p>\u201cAre you quite finished?\u201d Cronus asked him.</p><p>His gaze fell to the dais, narrowing. \u201cI will destroy you for this,\u201d his vowed brokenly. \u201cOne day you will die by my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot likely. Take him to Tartarus,\u201d the king told his guards, unconcerned. \u201cWhere he will rot for all eternity.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>IT TOOK HER TWO DAYS, but Nike finally located Atlas\u2019s home, a sprawling estate in Olympus. Or Titania, as Cronus had renamed the city. The amount of wealth Atlas had needed to acquire such a place astonished her\u2014and she knew exactly how much he\u2019d paid because she had once owned it. But then, she supposed he\u2019d considered every cent worth it. After living in a tiny cell for thousands of years, he\u2019d most likely wanted every bit of space he could get. And every amenity.</p><p>There was a swimming pool, more than thirty bedrooms, two winding, marble staircases and four fireplaces, and all the walls were comprised of solid gold. None of that interested her, however. Only his bedroom did.</p><p>There, she discovered more about the man who had sent her on her way. A man who would not have risked this just to avoid her face, as he\u2019d claimed. A man who would not have risked his life for anything other than love.</p><p>Nearly everything was as she\u2019d left it. A huge bed covered with black silk sheets. The walls were painted with murals of the sun and sky, and the furniture smelled of rich mahogany. There were multiple bookcases, each filled with leather-bound books. Her books. Beaded pillows were strategically placed along the floor. Places for him to lounge and read, as she had done.</p><p>What held her attention, however, was the only difference. A portrait hung above the hearth. A portrait of her.</p><p>He must have commissioned it after their time inside that tent, for she was reclined in a porcelain tub, bubbles sliding over her shoulders and chest, her hair soaked. She would have looked as plain and masculine as always, except he\u2019d had the artist add a sensual light to her dark eyes and a come-and-get-me curve to her lips.</p><p>Finally she knew how he saw her. As someone beautiful. He\u2019d once told her so, but she\u2019d had trouble believing him. Now...</p><p>Only a man in love would do such a thing. Only a man in love would keep such a thing in such a prominent place. Only a man in love would want to see a woman\u2019s portrait every night before he fell asleep, then wake up looking at it.</p><p>Oh, yes. He loved her. As she loved him.</p><p>There, outside of Tartarus, she\u2019d thought, hoped, that he did so, but she had let his words scrape against her already low self-esteem. How could so beautiful and sensual a man want her? she\u2019d wondered. But he did. He loved her. Proof: he\u2019d risked everything for her.</p><p>She could do no less for him.</p><p>Nike strode through the bedroom, knowing her lover would have a weapons case stashed somewhere\u2014and knowing exactly what to do with it.</p><p>ATLAS WAS NOT GIVEN A CELL of his own\u2014not at first. Still bleeding and frantic, fighting, he had been thrust into a cell with Erebos. Of course, that\u2019s who had been chosen as his cell mate, he\u2019d thought, rage filling him. A male who had once thought to claim his Nike. A male who had then stolen food from her, pushed her around and called her terrible names.</p><p>Atlas had seen it happen on numerous occasions. He hadn\u2019t done anything about it then, telling himself she deserved what she got, but he\u2019d wanted to. And there was no better time than now.</p><p>Even with his strength corralled by the collar and half his blood dried to his chest, even with his still-seeping wounds splitting open with every move he made, Atlas managed to defeat Erebos in record time. He punched, he kicked, he did not play fair, kneeing the god in the balls while he was down. In the end, a broken, bloody Erebos lay crying on the dirty floor, right alongside everyone who had tried to save him.</p><p>That\u2019s when Atlas was moved to the empty cell Nike had occupied. He stretched out on the cot, simply breathing in her lingering essence. His sweet, sweet Nike. He would have to spend eternity without her. Without even her brand. Once again, he roared.</p><p>What was she doing now? If she sought solace in the arms of another man, even in the years to come, he would tear this prison apart stone by stone and kill the bastard. As if. You sent her on her way to do just that. You want her happy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s all the racket? Seriously.\u201d</p><p>Gods, he was hearing her voice now. Locked up two days, and he was already headed into insanity.</p><p>His bars rattled, slid open. He rolled to his side, determined to send whoever it was away. When he caught sight of his beloved Nike, he blinked. Oh, yes, he was indeed going insane. She stood before him, clad in a black leather bra top and black leather pants. Her hair was slicked back in a smooth ponytail. Blood splattered her cheeks. Never had she looked more beautiful, her strength there for all to see.</p><p>She was holding someone\u2019s arm. Without their body. For the sensor in the wrist?</p><p>His hallucinations were certainly detailed.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she said, clearly impatient. She tossed the arm aside. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to say anything?\u201d</p><p>Slowly he sat up. He didn\u2019t want this moment to end. Didn\u2019t want to lose sight of her. \u201cI missed you. So much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wanted an apology. Stupid me. I much prefer this.\u201d She grinned, practically beaming. \u201cI missed you, too, but we\u2019ll have to catch up later.\u201d Her gaze fell to his chest, and she gaped in astonishment. Then she growled. \u201cDid the god king cut my name off you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She was holding a knife, he saw, and her knuckles bleached of color. \u201cI. Will. Kill. Him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready promised to do so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do it together, then. After we get out of here.\u201d Her attention flicked behind her, urgent, before returning to him. \u201cCome on. We have to go before someone realizes what I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me look at you. Just let me enjoy this moment. Let me apologize for what I said to you. You said you wanted an apology, yes? I didn\u2019t mean it, not a word I said that last day, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>She closed the distance between them and slapped him. Hard. The blow knocked him back against the cot and caused stars to wink over his vision.</p><p>Once more, he blinked at her. \u201cYou hit me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I\u2019ll do it again if you don\u2019t get your ass in gear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re real.\u201d He sat up, saying the words but not truly absorbing them. This couldn\u2019t be happening.</p><p>She dropped to her knees so that they were eye to eye. \u201cAgain, yes.\u201d Just as he\u2019d once done to her, she placed her fingers over his collar and blew into the center. As the metal softened, he finally understood what his brain had been trying to tell him. Nike was here. She was really here. And she was saving his life.</p><p>With a scowl, he jumped to his feet. \u201cI told you to go to earth, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, not the reaction I expected.\u201d She stood and pressed a swift kiss to his lips. \u201cGood thing I never listen to you. Now let\u2019s go. I\u2019ve already taken out the guards below. And no, I didn\u2019t kill your friends. Just made them wish they were dead.\u201d As she spoke, she latched on to his hand and dragged him out of the cell. \u201cCronus could realize what\u2019s going down at any moment and appear, and then we\u2019ll both be in trouble. As long as we\u2019re here, we\u2019re easy pickings.\u201d</p> <p>True. Nike was a fugitive now; he wanted her out of this prison, out of this realm, as soon as possible. \u201cYou risked your life to save me, you fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you risked your life to save me.\u201d</p><p>Down the stairs they pounded and, sure enough, all three of the guards were flat on their faces, motionless. One of them was missing an arm\u2014and he knew exactly where to find it. Not that he\u2019d take the time to tell. The arm, lost or not, would grow back. \u201cBut you were free. You had what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything,\u201d she threw over her shoulder.</p><p>Okay, wow. She\u2019d just admitted she wanted him more than freedom. Atlas couldn\u2019t help himself. He gave a tug, propelling her backward, into his arms. \u201cI love you,\u201d he finally proclaimed, and mashed their lips together. His tongue thrust deep, tasting, demanding. \u201cI mean it. I love you more than anything. Anyone.\u201d</p><p>She only allowed the kiss for a few seconds, her hands fisting his hair and taking everything he had to give, before she pulled away, panting. \u201cI love you, too. But let\u2019s get the hell out of here. I need your pretty head connected to your amazing body.\u201d</p><p>Once again, they surged forward. Still, he almost couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. It was so much like a dream. \u201cI\u2019m going to spend the rest of eternity making up for what I did to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I think I\u2019ll like seeing you grovel. But just for the record, I love my tattoo and I know why you said those nasty things. Sure, I would have found a better way to get you to safety, but then, I\u2019m smarter than you are, so really, I can\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed. Gods, he loved this woman. \u201cVixen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour vixen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine. Always. You\u2019ll mark me again just as soon as my skin heals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready planned on it.\u201d</p><p>Good. He wouldn\u2019t feel complete until she did. \u201cSo where are we going to live?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay in the heavens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ordered me to hide on earth. I thought we could do so\u2014together. Though I hate that you have to give up your amazing house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been there?\u201d He found he really liked the thought of her there, surrounded by his things, breathing in his essence. \u201cYou know where I chose to live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why did you? Choose there, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo feel closer to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re about to be a lot closer to me.\u201d</p><p>A laugh boomed from him. There was no woman more perfect for him. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ll miss from that house is the portrait of you. But now I have the real thing.\u201d He placed a swift kiss on her lips. \u201cBack to our new living arrangements. There are other gods out there, Greeks like you, who are in hiding. Cronus has never been able to find them. That means there are places he can\u2019t see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll find them and join them. We are Strength, after all. And Victory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Victory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can succeed where he has failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the meantime, we might even try to find the Lords of the Underworld. Cronus mentioned being distracted by them. If they are his enemies, they might be good friends for us to have.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cI know of whom you speak. They were Zeus\u2019s immortal warriors long ago, but now they house the demons once locked inside Pandora\u2019s box. Cronus will have his hands tied for a long, long time with them. They would be very good friends to have.\u201d</p><p>They reached the door and burst outside, all without incident. Clouds instantly enveloped them, the sun shining brightly. Nike whirled and threw herself in his arms, placing nips and kisses all over his face.</p><p>\u201cWe did it. Now take us somewhere. Anywhere. As long as we can be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said again, then did exactly as his woman had ordered.</p><p>Lords of the Underworld</p><p>A BONUS GUIDE</p><p>I, CRONUS, KING OF THE T ITANS, powerful warrior god, defender of the people, hereby command you to read and enjoy this guide. I am not mentioned nearly enough, but that is neither here nor there. What you will find in the pages that follow: an interview with Gena Showalter herself, conducted by the one and only New York Times bestselling author Kresley Cole; notes from those vile fools, the Hunters; once-missing chapters from Gena\u2019s first attempt at writing about these immortal warriors (she thought she tossed them, but I, all-powerful god that I am, dug them up); interviews with the Lords of the Underworld, as organized by that irreverent whelp William the Ever Randy; a candid discussion about the Lords of the Underworld among their women; answers to questions readers have been dying to know; a preview of the upcoming novel The Darkest Passion; and an intimate look at my very own sacred scrolls.</p><p>As I said, you will read and you will enjoy. That is your mission. Nay, your honor. Do not disappoint me. You will not like the results. Just ask Aeron, keeper of the demon of Wrath. Bad things tend to happen.</p><p>Yours in the heavens,</p><p>Cronus</p><p>KING OF THE TITANS</p><p>CLASSIFIED</p><p>FILES FROM THE PRIVATE RECORDS OF DEAN STEFANO,</p><p>THE HUNTERS\u2019 SECOND-IN-COMMAND</p><p>THE GREATER GOOD. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever fought for. A life without evil. Without sickness and violence. Without corruption and greed. That life is within my grasp. I know this, and that is what drives me so tirelessly. And yes, you might think me ruthless, the way I kill and seem to use others, but if you knew what could be\u2014peace and hope and love\u2014you would be fighting with me. You would be doing the same \u201cterrible\u201d things.</p><p>Who knows? One day you might. One day you might be like me, waking up every morning of every day, thinking, this could be it. This could be the day we find the box. The day we rid the world of Pandora\u2019s demons. The day that begins our eternal celebration because we live in a world of absolute bliss.</p><p>Am I distressed that we haven\u2019t reached that day yet? Yes. We are close, though...I know that, too. Meanwhile, I continue to be vigilant, to study the demons and the men that house them, meticulously documenting my observations in the hopes that someday they can be put to good use.</p><p>And just remember. If you aren\u2019t working with us, you are working against us. Remember also that our enemies tend to die, slowly and painfully....</p><p>\u2014Dean Stefano</p><p>Maddox</p><p>(BUDAPEST CONTINGENT)</p><p>Demon: Violence</p><p>Height: 6'4''</p><p>Hair: Black</p><p>Eyes: Violet ( Note: eyes glow red when angry)</p><p>Butterfly tattoo: Upper left shoulder, wrapping around to his back</p><p>Other distinguishing marks: Demon\u2019s skeletal face becomes visible through subject\u2019s skin when subject is angered.</p><p>Preferred weapon: Fists</p><p>Demon culpability: The stabbing death of Pandora, and thereby the disappearance of her box, can be traced directly to Violence. In modern society Violence is deemed responsible for street-gang warfare, rape, murder and terrorism.</p><p>Notable background: Curse resulting from Pandora\u2019s slaying caused the subject to be killed each night and resurrected each day for centuries. Curse has now been broken\u2014methods unclear. Subject still erupts into fits of violence and should be presumed volatile and highly dangerous.</p><p>Achilles heel: Recent emotional attachment to human female Ashlyn Darrow, former para-audiologist for the World Institute of Parapsychology who now resides at Budapest fortress. I cannot help but believe that if her mentor, the late Dr. Frederick McIntosh, hadn\u2019t hidden from her the true purpose of her work at the Institute, Darrow would not have defected to the Lords\u2019 camp. Note: Darrow is believed pregnant with subject\u2019s child. Due date to be determined.</p><p>Objectives: Capture Ashlyn Darrow if possible, use her as bait for subject to rescue, capture subject and imprison him until such time as Pandora\u2019s box is found. Note: Beware Darrow\u2019s ability to stand in one place and hear every conversation that ever took place there. Utter silence will be needed for any recon or capture missions. The element of surprise is crucial.</p><p>Lucien</p><p>(LEADER, BUDAPEST CONTINGENT)</p><p>Demon: Death</p><p>Height: 6'6''</p><p>Hair: Black, shoulder-length </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eyes: Mismatched\u2014one brown (normal eye) and one blue (believed to allow subject to see into the spiritual world)</p><p>Butterfly tattoo: Upper left shoulder, front of chest</p><p>Other distinguishing marks: Face and body are covered in scars. Subject emits an odor of roses presumed to be linked to his demon.</p> <p>Preferred weapon: Knives. Beware poisoned tips.</p><p>Demon culpability: Death is ultimately responsible for deciding which souls ascend to heaven and which are ushered to Hell. It\u2019s believed that the subject uses his bias against the Hunters not only to kill their bodies, but to unfairly ensure that their souls never make it to heaven.</p><p>Notable background: Subject is believed to have disfigured his own face and body centuries ago in a fit of rage, indicating an unstable temperament and a harmful nature. Subject can travel outside his body and has been known to transport himself from one location to the next faster than the eye can see, making him a unique threat.</p><p>Achilles heel: Two of note. The first, when subject\u2019s...soul, if that\u2019s what it is, leaves his body, that body is left vulnerable. That might be the perfect time to strike. Second, subject seems to have grown attached to Anya, minor Greek goddess of Anarchy. Also noteworthy: Anya is believed to have been bound by a curse herself, possibly hampering her powers. Recon team to investigate further in the hopes of exploiting the knowledge for the greater good.</p><p>Objectives: Take a divide-and-conquer approach by separating subject from the minor goddess of Anarchy so subject will suffer. If we can kill the goddess, forcing Death to separate soul from body, he will be most vulnerable. Note: The minor goddess has a penchant for petty theft, incendiary behavior and general insubordination. Following a recent confrontation in Chicago, she has been deemed a nemesis of the angel Galen and thus her permanent capture is of particular interest to the Hunters.</p> <p>Reyes</p><p>(BUDAPEST CONTINGENT)</p><p>Demon: Pain</p><p>Height: 6'5''</p><p>Hair: Dark brown</p><p>Eyes: Brown</p> <p>Butterfly tattoo: Chest and neck</p><p>Other distinguishing marks: Deeply tanned skin; frequently sports scabs caused by self-mutilation</p><p>Preferred weapon: Daggers; sword; guns</p><p>Demon culpability: Physical pain and suffering throughout the ages are attributed to this demon\u2019s acts of random cruelty.</p><p>Notable background: Subject has been witnessed going to excruciating lengths to cause himself pain. Jumping off rooftops and cutting his flesh are among his pastimes.</p><p>Achilles heel: Subject formed an attachment to human female Danika Ford following her kidnapping at the hands of fellow Lord Aeron. I personally did my utmost to recruit Danika to our cause, even convincing her to stage her own (second) kidnapping so the demons would rescue her and unwittingly bring a spy into their midst. The woman showed tremendous potential but was ultimately seduced by the dark side and aligned her loyalties with the Lords. I count her defection as a personal failure.</p><p>Objectives: Separate subject from Danika. Imprison him until Pandora\u2019s box can be found. Demonstrate to Danika the consequences of choosing the wrong allegiance in battle.</p><p>Paris</p> <p>(BUDAPEST CONTINGENT)</p><p>Demon: Promiscuity</p><p>Height: 6'8''</p><p>Hair: Varying shades of brown and black</p><p>Eyes: Blue</p><p>Butterfly tattoo: Lower back</p><p>Other distinguishing marks: Subject is widely regarded as the most physically appealing of all the Lords.</p><p>Preferred weapon: Sword</p><p>Demon culpability: Out-of-wedlock pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and infidelity all can be laid at Promiscuity\u2019s doorstep.</p><p>Notable background: Subject weakens without frequent physical release and cannot have sexual relations with the same woman twice. Subject has been known to seek out male partners as a last resort if no women are available, though he does not appear to enjoy such forays.</p><p>Achilles heel: While imprisoned in Hunters\u2019 research facility in Athens, subject formed a fascinating bond with the late female Hunter Sienna Blackstone (R.I.P.) and managed to overcome his demon\u2019s aversion to repeated sexual contact with the same woman. Since his untimely escape to Budapest, he has been reported to be relying heavily on ambrosia to regulate his moods and get him through the day.</p><p>Objectives: Exploit subject\u2019s dependence on ambrosia if possible. Perhaps even arrange for him to receive a tainted batch. Dangle the promise of information about Sienna in order to lure him back to Athens facility for further testing.</p><p>Aeron</p><p>(BUDAPEST CONTINGENT)</p><p>Demon: Wrath</p><p>Height: 6'6''</p><p>Hair: Military-cropped, brown</p><p>Eyes: Violet</p><p>Butterfly tattoo: Middle of back</p><p>Other distinguishing marks: A pair of black gossamer wings hidden by slits in his back when not in use. Face and body are covered with tattoos of war scenes, weaponry and the demon\u2019s victims. Two eyebrow rings.</p><p>Preferred weapon: Subject does not discriminate and embraces any weapon at his disposal.</p><p>Demon culpability: Wrath ostensibly preys only on victims it considers deserving of punishment. However, this pretense of meting out \u201cjustice\u201d is clearly the demon\u2019s twisted attempt to rationalize its killing sprees and evil deeds so it can continue to cause harm without consequences.</p><p>Notable background: Subject was taken over by bloodlust due to a curse of unknown origins and nearly killed human female Danika Ford in addition to her maternal grandmother, mother and older sister. Though the bloodlust seems to have passed, subject continues to be considered a menace to society.</p><p>Achilles heel: Subject views himself as godlike and humans as fragile and beneath him; however, his current determination to repay his fellow demon Paris for deeds unknown might prove a weak spot to be exploited. Subject is also devoted to the female demon minion Legion and has sworn to protect her from harm. Additionally, subject appears to be having apparent hallucinations that an invisible presence is spying on him.</p><p>Objective: Use subject\u2019s devotion to fellow Lords and the minion Legion against him. Recon team is also determining ways to turn his hallucinations to the Hunters\u2019 advantage.</p><p>Torin</p><p>(BUDAPEST CONTINGENT)</p><p>Demon: Disease</p><p>Height: 6'5''</p><p>Hair: White, shoulder-length</p><p>Eyes: Green</p><p>Butterfly tattoo: Stomach</p><p>Other distinguishing marks: Always wears long black gloves</p><p>Preferred weapon: As subject is confined to the Budapest fortress he has dubbed \u201cthe House of the Damned,\u201d he does not generally use weapons but is believed to have gun and sword training.</p><p>Demon culpability: Disease is responsible for at least two known plagues that resulted in thousands of casualties. This demon is also at the root of cancer deaths and all additional pestilence, most recently the dreaded Swine Flu pandemic.</p><p>Notable background: Subject is unable to touch another living being skin-to-skin without infecting it with disease; subject wears protective clothing at all times and maintains his distance from others to prevent such an occurrence. Subject chooses to hide in the Lords\u2019 fortress rather than accept the public blame he deserves for the illnesses he continues to cause, despite his \u201cattempts\u201d to keep the world \u201csafe.\u201d</p><p>Achilles heel: Subject\u2019s battle skills have likely diminished due to his confinement. He could be the weak link of the Lords and vulnerable to capture. A suspected relationship with female Lord Cameo has distracted the subject, and could also be used to Hunters\u2019 advantage.</p><p>Objectives: Exploit the subject\u2019s unique vulnerabilities and use this weakest link to take down the rest of the Lords. If we could somehow arrange for subject to touch the other Lords, they would not be killed, but they would never again be able to touch their loved ones without killing them. Such a realization might just cause them to turn themselves in.</p><p>Sabin</p><p>(LEADER OF THE GREECE CONTINGENT)</p><p>Demon: Doubt</p><p>Height: 6'7''</p><p>Hair: Brown</p><p>Eyes: Gold-brown</p><p>Butterfly tattoo: Right ribcage and waist</p><p>Other distinguishing marks: Wears a necklace believed to be a gift to him from his deceased friend, Baden, demon of Distrust, the Hunters\u2019 first victim.</p><p>Preferred weapon: Subject used to rely on knives, guns, throwing stars et al, but now, like the coward he is, he prefers to hide behind his Harpy bride for protection.</p><p>Demon culpability: The vilest of all demons whispers insecurities into the ears of anyone within reach and causes crippling, at times life-threatening self-doubt. This demon and the despicable creature who houses it are directly responsible for the suicide of my beloved wife, Darla, eleven years ago.</p><p>Notable background: I find it impossible to write objectively about my most deeply hated foe. This monster who calls himself a man seduced my faithful wife away from me with false promises and dirty lies and coaxed her to betray my secrets. When he\u2019d gotten what he needed from her, he let his demon go to work, and the next thing I knew, my wife had slashed her wrists.</p><p>Achilles Heel: His single-minded devotion to Gwendolyn the Timid, his Harpy wife. Due to recent complications at our Chicago training facility, we are uncertain as to the extent to which we might be able to use her against him. But sometimes it is better to ask for forgiveness than permission.</p><p>Objectives: Secretly, without Galen\u2019s knowledge, separate subject from his wife. Seduce her, as subject likes to seduce other men\u2019s wives, and arrange for subject to find her dead, bleeding body.</p><p>Gideon</p><p>(GREECE CONTINGENT)</p><p>Demon: Lies</p><p>Height: 6'3''</p><p>Hair: Dyed Blue</p><p>Eyes: Blue, kohl-rimmed</p><p>Butterfly tattoo: Right thigh</p><p>Other distinguishing marks: Multiple piercings and general Goth appearance</p><p>Preferred weapon: All of them. Subject seems to have no specific preference, using whatever is nearby.</p><p>Demon culpability: Lies has infiltrated politics worldwide, resulting in false promises from world leaders and the disintegration of modern society.</p><p>Notable background: Subject is unable to tell the truth without experiencing terrible pain. My forefathers were able to capture and contain subject for a prolonged period of time and, in the course of limb-regeneration experiments, removed subject\u2019s feet. Unfortunately, subject ultimately escaped with the aid of his demon cohorts and both his feet have since grown back. The feet we removed, however, we are still in possession of. We exacted revenge in Chicago recently with the removal of both subject\u2019s hands, but again were unable to contain him for long. We now have the removed hands, as well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Achilles heel: Unknown.

Earplugs are needed when around her.</p><p>Preferred weapon: Semi-automatic, long-range rifles</p><p>Demon culpability: Misery is responsible for mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. The fact that both are reported at higher rates today than ever before suggests that the demon\u2019s reach is increasing.</p><p>Notable background: Subject causes profound emotional anguish in everyone around her. Additionally, subject was, until recently, believed to be the lone female Lord of the Underworld. New events suggest that additional female Lords might in fact exist.</p><p>Achilles heel: Subject is believed to have a relationship with Torin, keeper of Disease. Subject will be closely observed for any physical or emotional vulnerability that might pave the way for an opportunity to capture her. But because of the supposed relationship with Disease, protective gear will be needed when apprehending her.</p> <p>Objectives: Recon team is exploring ways to force subject to use her voice to our advantage.</p><p>Amun</p><p>(GREECE CONTINGENT)</p><p>Demon: Secrets</p><p>Height: 6'6''</p><p>Hair: Brown</p><p>Eyes: Brown</p><p>Butterfly tattoo: Right calf</p> <p>Other distinguishing marks: Dark skin</p><p>Preferred weapon: Things of an exotic nature.</p><p>Demon culpability: The demon of Secrets fosters a lack of communication that contributes to individual issues such as the breakdown of marriages and global problems such as breaches of national security and the inability to achieve world peace.</p><p>Notable background: Subject is unable to speak without the secrets of the world pouring out of his mouth\u2014as I regrettably experienced first-hand at our Chicago facility. Also of note, when he speaks, you hear the voice of the person whose secret he is revealing.</p><p>Achilles heel: Subject\u2019s fear of speaking might be utilized to our advantage.</p><p>Objectives: Capture and interrogate subject in the hopes of discerning the secrets he keeps and using them against the Lords.</p><p>Strider</p><p>(GREECE CONTINGENT)</p><p>Demon: Defeat</p><p>Height: 6'5''</p><p>Hair: Blond</p><p>Eyes: Blue</p><p>Butterfly tattoo: Left hip</p><p>Other distinguishing marks: Subject was created, not born, yet has a birthmark on the right side of his buttocks. Small, brown and jagged at the edges.</p><p>Preferred weapon: Subject embraces all weaponry.</p><p>Demon culpability: The demon of Defeat is determined to win at all costs and will do whatever it takes to ensure victory. Defeat has brought about the downfall of athletes worldwide due to its encouragement of illegal tactics like steroids to obtain a win.</p><p>Notable background: Subject cannot lose an argument or battle without succumbing to intense physical agony and prolonged sleep.</p><p>Achilles heel: Subject\u2019s inability to lose gracefully.</p><p>Objectives: Issue a challenge the demon cannot refuse, one that leads him straight into a trap.</p><p>Kane</p><p>(GREECE CONTINGENT)</p><p>Demon: Disaster</p><p>Height: 6'4''</p><p>Hair: Mixture of brown, black and gold</p><p>Eyes: Hazel</p><p>Butterfly tattoo: Right hip</p><p>Other distinguishing marks: We are still searching.</p><p>Preferred weapon: Rifles and other long-range weaponry</p><p>Demon culpability: Disaster can be held accountable for everything from traffic accidents to construction site fatalities to plane crashes. It is harmful, often lethal, to anyone and anything it comes into contact with.</p><p>Notable background: Subject is unable to move without causing ceilings to collapse, vehicles to explode and other assorted catastrophes to occur. Miraculously and despicably, subject seems to escape injury from such incidents, but those around him are less fortunate.</p><p>Achilles heel: Unknown</p><p>Objectives: Recon team is exploring ways to isolate and capture subject and channel the incidents he causes into a strategy that will be advantageous to us.</p><p>AWAKENING PANDORA</p><p>PROLOGUE</p><p>AT ONE TIME, HE\u2019D BEEN a man. A warrior. A king. His enemies had trembled in fear, and his lovers had trembled in ecstasy. Both had begged for the sweet release only he could give: death or pleasure. A slash of his blade or a caress of his hand. Life was sweet, so sweet.</p><p>But one night, everything changed.</p><p>A woman came to him, the most beautiful he\u2019d ever beheld. Seductive, seemingly guileless. Legend would one day call her Pandora. He would one day call her Witch.</p><p>The first time she visited him, she wore a white virgin\u2019s robe, and the hem danced around her ankles as if the very air around her could not help but touch her. Know her. She had hair as dark as a raven\u2019s wing, a face so delicate it almost hurt to gaze upon, and eyes so deep a violet that looking into them was like peering into a never ending abyss.</p><p>No one understood how she\u2019d entered his fortress, only that she\u2019d demanded an audience with him. He\u2019d granted her one, certain she was one of a thousand others who wished to know the taste of a king. He\u2019d meant to scold her for such daring and send her on her way. Now, seeing her...</p><p>\u201cYou may speak,\u201d he told her, waving his royal hand through the air.</p><p>\u201cI come to offer you the world, King Maddox. This one, and any other you might desire.\u201d Her voice was lilting, pure enchantment. \u201cMagic will be yours to wield. Time and space will bow to your every whim. Power beyond your wildest imaginings will flow from your hands.\u201d</p><p>Seated on his throne of gold, Maddox laughed in disbelief. The strongest of his men surrounded him in a half circle and they, too, laughed at her words. Such things were impossible in this dark world of war and sacrifice. Magic and power belonged to those beyond their reach, the gods and goddesses who rarely ventured here. Still, the claim certainly gained his full attention.</p><p>Females lied to him constantly as they fought for a place in his bed and at his side. In this, the beauteous creature was no different.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you ask in return for this gift, sweet?\u201d he asked dryly. \u201cMarriage? To become queen? The right to bear my child?\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin, proud, beguiling. \u201cI ask only that you and your army hide my greatest treasure.\u201d</p><p>He nearly snorted. Her greatest treasure, in his mind, was her body, and he was more than happy to hide it in his bed. \u201cI accept,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cMy men, however, will have to decide for themselves.\u201d</p><p>One by one his brothers-in-arms stepped forward, each mimicking his acceptance. They, too, were smiling widely.</p><p>The woman licked her lips in anticipation. \u201cMay I kiss you, great king, to complete our bargain?\u201d</p><p>He arched a brow. \u201cI would be most disappointed if you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Slowly she climbed the marble stairs and onto the dais, her gown still flowing around her like a phantom, alive, separate from her somehow. When she stood before him, a fragrant breeze wafted to his nostrils, a breeze of midnight tempests and...power? The magic she\u2019d sworn to bestow upon him? No. Surely not.</p><p>\u201cYour lips,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTake them.\u201d He didn\u2019t shift from his reclined position, forcing her to bend, to come to him. She did. Closer. Closer still. And then her lips gently pressed against his. She opened for him, but didn\u2019t sweep her tongue into his mouth as he expected. No, she uttered a single word. His new prison. His downfall. His sole reason for existence, he would learn.</p><p>\u201cViolence,\u201d she said. A gust of wind burst from her mouth and into his, down his throat and into his stomach, his bones. He was suddenly unable to move, locked in place as the brutal wind invaded every corner of his body, attaching itself. Becoming part of him. His muscles shook and burned. His stomach quivered. Pain, so much pain.</p><p>He wanted to curse, to fight. To kill. What was happening to him? The wind was solidifying, becoming a...no. No! It was becoming a living entity, another consciousness inside him. He could hear the savageness of its thoughts, could feel the darkness of its desires. He gritted his teeth so forcefully, blood filled his mouth. Grab your sword. Attack! But he could not. He was still trapped, helpless to the wind-creature as it ravaged him.</p><p>The woman moved to the man at his right, and there was nothing Maddox could do, nothing he could say to stop her. Her lips descended upon Baden, a scarred, battle-hardened man with more integrity, more honor, than anyone else Maddox had encountered.</p><p>\u201cDistrust,\u201d she whispered, and Baden, too, was frozen in place, shaking and under siege.</p><p>Over and over, she approached the warriors, kissing them, uttering a different word each time. \u201cPain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromiscuity.\u201d</p><p>After a while, her voice faded from his ears and he knew nothing except darkness.</p><p>When she left, he didn\u2019t know. He only knew that when he awakened, he was stronger than he\u2019d ever been, faster, better. The creature, the second consciousness, lay dormant now, so he tried not to concern himself with it. But magic, he learned, was indeed his to command. Time and space did bow to his every whim, and power beyond his wildest imaginings did flow from his hands, just as the woman had claimed.</p><p>He reveled in his new abilities, embraced them, enjoyed everything about them\u2014until the beast inside him awoke, no longer content to endure his rule. The beast inside all of the men awoke.</p><p>That\u2019s when the woman began to call upon them.</p><p>The beasts were her servants, so in turn, they became her servants. When she was angered, it was Vrede she commanded to wreak destruction. He killed without mercy, forced by the beast inside him to unleash a torrent of wrath upon whomever she desired. There was no way to stop it, no way to fight against it.</p><p>Challen she called for fucking. Torin she called for plague. Lucien she called for death. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Over the years, he and his warriors lost touch with their humanity. They became wild, nearly uncontrollable, and more vicious than their creator had ever anticipated. Maddox, more so than most. He was the epitome of anger, fury and rage, so lethal a single glance at him could scare the bravest of souls to death.</p><p>When Pandora realized she would soon lose all control of them, she locked the essence of them inside a box. They stayed in this box for many centuries, able to observe the world around them but unable to act. Yet, as time often did, memories of their treacherous deeds dulled. Pandora remembered only the good things they\u2019d done for her. They\u2019d punished her enemies, after all. They\u2019d destroyed those unworthy of her. They\u2019d saddened those who did not deserve happiness.</p><p>And so, one night she opened the box, meaning to release only one or two of her pets. All but one burst forward before she was able to slam the lid back into place. Yet the beasts were no longer hers to command, and they hated her for what she\u2019d done to them.</p> <p>Pandora discarded the box and fled for her life, hiding so that none could find her.</p><p>The beasts scattered across the world, wreaking havoc. The one still trapped inside the box, well, he waited...and he waited....</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>\u201cYOU GET CAUGHT, AND I\u2019M hauling ass to Mexico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour concern for me is touching. Really.\u201d Fighting a grin, Farrah Roberts anchored a small flesh-colored headphone on her left ear and eyed River Jackson, the only person in the world that she trusted. He was also the nineteen-year-old kid responsible for making sure she wasn\u2019t caught. \u201cJust watch the feed and warn me if I pick up a shadow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRub it in a little more, why don\u2019t you?\u201d he said with a pout. \u201cYou\u2019re the big, bad thief and I\u2019m the sidekick. I get the grunt work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to leave the target\u2019s apartment from the roof. You really want to dangle twenty-nine stories from a thin piece of wire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah,\u201d he said, but they both knew he lied. River was afraid of heights. The little shit would pee his pants.</p><p>Right now they sat inside a large white van that looked like any other service van parked on Main Street. What was inside their vehicle, however, was much different than any of the others. Monitors that revealed much of the activity in and around the apartment complex she was about to enter, as well as computers and blueprints.</p><p>Farrah slid a silver ring down her left index finger. If tonight was a success, she would not have to use what was hidden inside it. \u201cYou\u2019ve already hacked into the power system?\u201d</p><p>River snorted. \u201cWhat, I\u2019m an amateur now? Of course I\u2019m in.\u201d</p> <p>Her lips twitched at his affront. He could hack into anything, anytime, no matter how secure it was, and he wasn\u2019t shy about trumpeting his abilities. Farrah loved his confidence, so different from the lack of self-esteem he\u2019d once exhibited.</p><p>She\u2019d found him wandering the streets six years ago, had taken him in though she\u2019d been a child herself, and paid for his education. He\u2019d been a shy little thing back then, unsure, awkward and desperate for attention.</p><p>\u201cSo...how do I look?\u201d she asked, pinning a small black microphone to the collar of her top.</p><p>He eyed her up and down, from the slicked ponytail holding her dark hair captive, to the trench coat hiding the black body suit she\u2019d practically sewed to each of her curves, to the shiny boots on her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you charge two hundred dollars an hour for bondage and pain. No way you\u2019ll blend with the snobs who live in Crescent Moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to blend. I just have to make it into the elevator without being stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if you\u2019re stopped, I\u2019m controlling their video recordings here. They won\u2019t get your face on tape. Not permanently, at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they will get a description to give the police,\u201d she said dryly.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, with your makeup and contacts, your face looks like a thousand others.\u201d River hefted the black velvet bag that contained her tools and anchored it on her shoulder. \u201cGet out of here. I\u2019m bored.\u201d</p><p>Farrah saw the apprehension in his emerald eyes and bent over to kiss his cheek. He worried about her every time she worked\u2014despite the fact that she\u2019d last been caught ten years ago, at the age of fifteen. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you will. \u2019Cause I\u2019m watching your back.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, she exited the van\u2019s passenger door and entered the cold Dallas night. River reached out and pinched her butt just before she shut the door. Her smile widened. She didn\u2019t bother turning around to flip him off; the van\u2019s windows were tinted so she wouldn\u2019t get to see his reaction.</p><p>\u201cTesting,\u201d she whispered into her mouthpiece. It was taped to her cheek and so thin she often forgot it was there. \u201cTesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopy is good,\u201d River said.</p><p>\u201cAsswipe,\u201d she muttered, and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou liked it\u2014you know you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, I\u2019ll demote you to laundry boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuh-lease. You need me.\u201d</p><p>The moon was high, bright, and the street was busy as she maneuvered across. They\u2019d parked a half-mile from the building, and she made the trek through shadows and back alleys without incident. No one paid her any attention. When Crescent\u2019s towering chrome and glass came into view, she whispered, \u201cEntering in thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom and John are at the screens, drinking coffee and reading a magazine.\u201d</p><p>Male names: that meant both of the guards inside the building were armed. Just in case she and River had an unwanted listener, anyone with a weapon was deemed a boy; everyone else got stuck with names like Bubbles and Bambi.</p><p>As predicted, Farrah entered the lobby thirty seconds later. Except for the guards, the lobby was deserted. Good. That\u2019s why she\u2019d chosen Saturday at midnight. The old were in bed, and the young were out partying. Her boots clicked on the pink-veined marble, bouncing her bag at her side.</p><p>Showtime.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you, miss?\u201d one of the guards asked. He clanked his coffee onto the gray countertop and pushed to his feet. He was a burly man in his late fifties. Friendly face, tired eyes.</p><p>Farrah didn\u2019t slow her steps, but tossed him an I\u2019m-so-innocent smile over her shoulder. \u201cActing like you don\u2019t recognize me? Not funny,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know I live here.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he was embarrassed not to \u201crecognize\u201d her. Maybe he was just too tired to care. But he didn\u2019t try to stop her as she entered the elevator. And then the doors closed, shutting her inside. Alone. A relieved sigh parted her lips. She would have preferred to have rented one of the apartments and move around freely, without (much) artiface, but all of the apartments were already rented and there was a year-long waiting list. No thanks. She already had a buyer for this particular item, so waiting wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>\u201cWhich floor is emptied?\u201d she asked River.</p><p>Tap, tap, tap. His fingers flew over the keyboard. \u201cEight is your best bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPressing eight.\u201d She jabbed the button, and the elevator jostled into motion. When it stopped on the correct floor, she strode into the hallway and pretended to dig in her purse for a key. \u201cHold the elevator for me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d River said. \u201cAlright, the guards are watching you and they see you at the door. I\u2019m switching the feed...now.\u201d He paused. \u201cExcellent. All they see now is an empty hallway, so they\u2019ll assume you entered the room. I\u2019m controlling the elevator feed, as well. You\u2019re good to go.\u201d</p><p>Farrah hurried back to the elevator and swiped the key card she\u2019d stolen. Anyone who wished to enter the penthouse needed a card to bypass the twenty-eighth floor and reach the twenty-ninth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking at the foyer,\u201d River said. \u201cMatt and Mike are waiting for you across from the elevator doors at ten and two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCopy that.\u201d Farrah dug a black mask from her bag and pulled it over her face. That done, she stuffed her gloved hands into her coat pockets, wrapping her fingers around the tranq guns anchored inside of each. She was a thief, not a killer, and never carried lethal weapons.</p><p>As adrenaline rushed through her, so heady and strong she could have drunk it, she withdrew the guns and held them at her sides. Her heart pounded excitedly in her chest.</p><p>It had always been this way. A rush. Addictive.</p><p>She\u2019d begun stealing at the age of twelve; her mother had been sick, and they\u2019d needed money. She stole small things at first: food, clothing, wallets. But as her skills increased, so did her targets. Now, her mom was gone and she had a hefty bank account.</p><p>There was no limit to what she could take\u2014or who she could take from. Stopping had never appealed to her.</p><p>\u201cAwfully quiet in there,\u201d River said, cutting into her thoughts. \u201cYou imagining me naked or something?\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sexy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrogant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold that thought,\u201d he said. \u201cArrival in five. Four. Three. Two.\u201d The elevator dinged; the doors opened.</p><p>Immediately Farrah raised her arms, aiming her guns at the ten and two positions. She squeezed the triggers before the guards, who were already standing, had a chance to realize she was masked. Red darts pegged them both in the neck. One guy managed to withdraw his weapon, but the tranquilizer was strong, mainly used for wild animals, and he tumbled onto the plush, dark brown carpet without firing a single shot. His friend soon joined him.</p><p>\u201cWe good?\u201d River asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good.\u201d Sheathing the guns, she quickly moved to the front door. Unlocked. But she didn\u2019t enter. Not yet. \u201cI\u2019m ready for the power surge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverriding power system...now.\u201d Lights instantly flickered off, leaving only a dark, dark void. Absolute silence slithered through the air, causing her ears to ring. A necessary evil. It was easier to disable the security system by cutting the power than to use light and sound to cover her actions while she danced around motion detectors and heat sensors. \u201cYou have approximately five minutes before they\u2019re able to trip the wire and recharge.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEntering now.\u201d She swept inside, time ticking away inside her mind. Here it was lighter than the foyer had been, thin rays of moonlight seeping in from the unadorned windows. For days she\u2019d poured over the blueprint of the apartment, so she knew exactly where to go. The owner, according to her contacts, was vacationing in the French Riviera with his mistress. The wife was here, though\u2014hopefully sleeping.</p><p>Silently Farrah moved, rounding corners and taping tiny cameras onto the walls, each one giving River a direct view of her surroundings. \u201cHallway one, live,\u201d he said. A pause, then the clatter of his keyboard. \u201cLiving room, live. Uh, you\u2019ve got a man asleep on the couch.\u201d</p><p>Farrah backtracked, used a dart on the third guard, or whoever he was, then leapt back into motion.</p> <p>\u201cKitchen, live,\u201d River said. Pause, clatter. \u201cHallway two, live.\u201d</p><p>The study was up next. Reaching the double doors, Farrah\u2019s exhilaration intensified. This was it. The room. She gave the knob an experimental twist. Big surprise, it was locked. Not with a simple pin-tumbler or a wafer-tumbler, either, but a tubular lock, with pins all the way around the circumference of the cylinder plug.</p><p>Usually she preferred museums to private collectors. More of a challenge. This job, however, was proving to be quite fun. \u201cHow am I on time?\u201d she whispered, dropping her bag and crouching down. She withdrew the proper tools.</p><p>\u201cFour minutes, two seconds.\u201d</p><p>She inserted the pick gun, a vibrating piece of metal that pushed the lock\u2019s pins up to the shear line, all the while working the tension wrench into the bottom hole. Click. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d</p> <p>Too easy.</p><p>\u201cSix seconds,\u201d River said. \u201cNot your record, but not bad.\u201d</p><p>Farrah quietly entered the study, her boots sinking into the thick crimson rug. Even through her mask, she smelled woodsy cigar smoke, leather and freshly polished oak. The spacious room boasted wall-to-wall bookshelves. There was a desk in the center, a cushioned chair and several display cases perched on small marble stands.</p><p>\u201cDo you see it?\u201d River asked, his excitement palpable.</p><p>Her gaze scanned...scanned...seeing many artifacts and several pieces of jewelry until finally lighting on a small wooden box. Dark, surmounted by a deliciously carved face\u2014a man\u2019s face, Farrah realized, when she stood just in front of it\u2014with a glittery golden cord wrapped around the middle.</p><p>The gold embossed tag underneath read, Pandora\u2019s box. Satisfaction hummed inside of her.</p> <p>\u201cContact,\u201d she said, awed.</p><p>Never taking her eyes from the item, she extracted the glass-cutter and a strip of velvet from her bag. The box was certainly beautiful, the most beautiful and detailed she\u2019d ever seen. And the masculine face was a sight to behold, savage, raw, elemental, pulling all of her feminine instincts to the surface. Still, she didn\u2019t know why the buyer was willing to pay her a cool mil for it. Especially since Pandora was a legend, a myth, and there was probably nothing inside.</p><p>With precise movements, Farrah sliced a circle in the glass, keeping it suctioned to the cutter so that it didn\u2019t fall to the ground and shatter. She set the piece on top of the case.</p><p>Open the box.</p><p>She\u2019d been in the process of reaching out when the words whispered across her mind. Deep, masculine. Seductive...Like the face.</p><p>Open it.</p><p>Surprised, she straightened and frowned. \u201cDid you just tell me to open it?\u201d she asked River.</p><p>\u201cNope. No time for that. You need to get your ass in gear. Less than three minutes remaining.\u201d</p> <p>Open it. See what\u2019s inside.</p><p>What was wrong with her? Farrah shook her head, clasped the box, and carefully wrapped it in the velvet. She secured the package inside her bag, part of her hoping to hear the voice again.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d River suddenly bit out. \u201cThe wife is awake and walking into the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe probably got spooked when the power went out and is fixing a midnight snack. We\u2019re okay,\u201d she said, but she was already moving to the far window. She slipped out of her trench.</p><p>\u201cJust get the hell out of there, would ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long,\u201d River said. \u201cLess than a minute.\u201d</p><p>Before he\u2019d finished the last word, the lights flicked on. The heater kicked on, as well, emitting a gentle hum. Farrah swished aside the drapes and raised the window. Cold air blustered all around her as she gathered her coat and bag, then stepped onto the ledge.</p><p>\u201cThe wife is trying to wake the guard,\u201d River said with an edge of panic. Then, \u201cShe found the dart in his neck. Damn it, she\u2019s running toward the study.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Heart pumping with delicious speed, Farrah slid the ultra-thin wiregun from her bag, raised her arm and squeezed a shot. The sharp tip embedded in the beam above her head. She tugged once, twice, making sure the line was secure. Then she jumped, feet first, and flew toward the ground.</p><p>The wire slowed just before she hit\u2014she\u2019d measured the distance before ever entering the building\u2014then stopped altogether, softly lowering her to a stand. She released the handle, removed her mask and casually walked away from the building as if she hadn\u2019t a care.</p><p>She was smiling.</p><p>INSIDE THE BOX, M ADDOX seethed with his need to escape. Close, so close. He\u2019d spoken to the woman, and she\u2019d heard him. No one else had ever heard him. But she had hidden him away, cutting him off from her erotic voice. A voice that caused every cell in his body to awaken, to roar, demanding release. How long since he\u2019d spent himself inside a female? How long since he\u2019d known anything except darkness? How long since the beast inside him had experienced the sweet taste of violence?</p><p>Eternity.</p><p>Did the woman mean to forget him? Oh, he would allow no such thing. He would convince her to free him\u2014and she would be able to do so, as no other human had been able, he knew it\u2014and his body\u2019s long-denied needs would, at last, be met. And yes, the beast would, at last, be unleashed....</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>A TOTAL SUCCESS. A GAIN. Farrah was coming off her adrenaline high, but she couldn\u2019t stop smiling. No casualties, no foot or car chase. Just a job well done.</p><p>The buyer had insisted she meet with him the same night she \u201cacquired\u201d the box. Perhaps he thought she\u2019d sell it to someone else. Perhaps he simply couldn\u2019t wait to hold it in his hands. Either way, Farrah texted him, letting him know the box was in her possession and she would meet him at their agreed upon location in one hour.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d was his nearly instantaneous response. He was already in Dallas, had probably flown out before her, three weeks ago.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know his name or even what he looked like, and she preferred it that way. They always met in the shadows. In the last six months, she\u2019d done several jobs for him, all of them boxes very similar to the one in her bag. What he wanted with them, she didn\u2019t know. He paid without balking and never tried to renegotiate. That was what mattered to Farrah.</p><p>\u201cWanna see it?\u201d she asked River.</p><p>He didn\u2019t have to ask what \u201cit\u201d was. \u201cHell, yeah, I want to see it.\u201d He kept his attention on the road as he maneuvered their sedan along the highway. They\u2019d switched out the van in favor of a rental that would blend with every other car on the road. Tall streetlights whizzed past them, illuminating, then drowning in shadows. Trees and buildings flashed in and out of view. \u201cThat baby\u2019s gonna buy me a kick-ass Lamborghini.\u201d</p><p>Farrah settled the bag on her stomach. She kicked her legs onto the dash and sunk deeper into her seat. \u201cWhy a Lamborghini?\u201d She would have expected him to list all the computer equipment he couldn\u2019t live another moment without.</p><p>\u201cOwning a ride like that is like stumbling upon an island of naked, horny women whose sole goal in life is to pleasure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d she scoffed. \u201cI would never date a guy just because he drives a nice car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you don\u2019t date, period.\u201d</p><p>No, she didn\u2019t. Men were not a priority for her. They couldn\u2019t be. They\u2019d learn her secret and betray her. As she well knew.</p><p>In the quiet of the night, as she lay in bed, she might long for one, for strong arms and heat and passion. For sex that was hot and hard, pounding. But she would never allow herself to indulge. There was no one she could trust\u2014except River, but he didn\u2019t count. They were best friends, practically brother and sister.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good-looking kid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d he interjected with a pointed glare. His fingers tightened on the steering wheel. \u201cWe\u2019ve had this discussion before. I\u2019m a man. Not a kid, not a boy. You get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019re a good-looking man.\u201d He was tall and lean, perhaps too lean. He had light brown hair, piercing green eyes and deceptively angelic features. \u201cIf a girl\u2014woman\u2014doesn\u2019t want you for who you are, you shouldn\u2019t want her.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cYou act like I\u2019m looking for something serious. I\u2019m a perv looking for action, Farr, that\u2019s all. Now show me the box already. Your conversation skills suck.\u201d</p><p>Fighting a grin, Farrah dug inside the bag and lifted the black velvet mound. Slowly, gently, she unwound the material layer by soft layer. The intricately carved top came into view, the man\u2019s face somehow more savage than she remembered. Her stomach fluttered deliciously. If only such a powerful man truly existed....</p><p>River darted a quick glance at it and whistled. \u201cThat\u2019s the coolest one so far. Have you opened it yet? Was it empty like the others?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And I don\u2019t know.\u201d The buyer had dictated she not open a single box. Of course, she disobeyed every time, her curiosity too great. Now, however...with the voice... She was a little afraid, which was stupid.</p><p>\u201cAh, come on. Open, open, open,\u201d River chanted.</p><p>Her hand shook as she reached for the glittery gold ribbon. As if on cue, the voice returned.</p><p>Open it, he beseeched. His husky, wine-rich timbre filled her head, invaded her blood, tingling along the surface of her skin. Open it and see what\u2019s inside. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She jerked her hand away. Incredulous, she blinked over at River. \u201cDo you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear what?\u201d He frowned.</p><p>\u201cThat...voice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you actually believe that shit about Pandora and her evil spirits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I just, I don\u2019t know. This very deep, very masculine voice keeps telling me to\u2014oh, never mind!\u201d She waved her hand through the air. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to explain without sounding crazy.\u201d</p><p>River\u2019s face scrunched and he gave her a brief, you-are-so-weird look. \u201cYou been puffing the magic dragon again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe serious!\u201d</p><p>He barked out a laugh. \u201cI am. Come on, tell Brother River what the naughty voice is telling you to do.\u201d</p> <p>One peek. Just take one peek.</p><p>Farrah gulped. \u201cYou truly don\u2019t hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019ll give you so much pleasure, you\u2019ll feel me inside of you for days. All you have to do is. Open. The. Box.</p><p>Farrah\u2019s cheeks heated with a blush. Now she knew it was her imagination. Hadn\u2019t she just lamented about her desire for a man, for passion and hard, pounding sex? She uttered an embarrassed chuckle. \u201cNever mind. Just forget I said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Is the voice telling you to take off all your clothes and dance in the moonlight?\u201d He wiggled his dark brows. \u201cIs the voice telling you to wait for the mother ship to take you home?\u201d</p> <p>She flipped him off, and he gave another laugh.</p><p>Of its own accord, her gaze returned to the box. She removed a glove and traced a fingertip over the man\u2019s\u2014warrior\u2019s\u2014square jawline, over the slope of his nose, the fullness of his lips. Warmth tingled up her arm. Drugging warmth, electric warmth.</p><p>An animalistic purr filled her ears. Do not stop. Touch more.</p><p>She gasped and snatched her arm away, even tugged her glove back onto her hand. Even knowing she was imagining things, she couldn\u2019t stop her tingling reaction.</p><p>Woman, I said touch more, not less!</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d River demanded. His arms jerked as he faced her, and the car swerved. Someone honked at them. He hurriedly straightened in the proper lane.</p><p>\u201cNothing, nothing,\u201d she assured him. But a wave of need continued to slam into her. Need like she\u2019d never known before, as if she were touching a flesh and blood man and he was touching her in return. That purr... \u201cI\u2019m not going to open it,\u201d she said, more for the voice than for River. \u201cThat will mess up the ribbon, and the buyer will know we peeked. He might refuse to pay us.\u201d</p><p>I can smell your arousal, woman. Now I want to taste it.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s just get this thing to its proud new owner,\u201d she said on a shaky breath.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d River had lost his teasing air and now hummed with concern. Not that she could blame him. She\u2019d never acted this way before. So...unstable. She was the calm one. She was the one who took everything in stride. She was the one who remained unaffected. Yet here she was, lusting after a voice inside her head.</p><p>Time to put the box away.</p><p>Farrah began to wrap the velvet around the wood, but the voice stopped her. No. Please, no. It was tortured this time, a desperate plea. Her mouth went dry, and she stilled. Maybe all of her adrenaline rushes had finally caught up to her and fried her brain. Maybe she needed to take a vacation.</p><p>River eased the car into the parking lot of a motel close to the designated nightclub. Even from here, she could hear the bump and grind of the music, a wild, frantic beat that aroused, beckoned. People milled in and out, laughing, talking, flirting.</p><p>\u201cI hate these clandestine meetings,\u201d River muttered, parking. The meeting place might stay the same, but they parked somewhere new each time.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve met with this guy eight other times. Nothing\u2019s ever happened.\u201d Farrah gently set the box on the dash and wound a thick silver belt around her waist, trying to make her body suit look more sexy and less burglarish.</p><p>River twisted and leaned into the backseat, grabbing the Polaroid camera she\u2019d thrown back there. He snapped a picture of the box. The bright flash of light was almost blinding, and for several seconds she saw orange-gold spots.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, handing her the photo. \u201cProof.\u201d</p><p>She slid the picture under her belt. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou prepared for anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d She held up her left hand and wiggled her fingers. \u201cI have the powdered sedative in my ring and a knife in my boot. Plus, I\u2019ll have the dart gun under my trench.\u201d Even as she spoke, she was anchoring the gun at her side and tugging her coat around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he suddenly burst out. \u201cI hate sending you in there alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still wearing my headgear, so you\u2019ll be able to hear everything that\u2019s said. Besides, it\u2019s best this way, and you know it. We get the money without giving him a chance to steal the merchandise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t have to like it,\u201d he grumbled. He pulled a Glock from his boot and checked the clip. Every time she saw him with a deadly weapon, she experienced a jolt. She had brought him into this dangerous life, but if anything ever happened to him...</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cI\u2019ll text you when he\u2019s wired the money. You come back with the box, and we\u2019ll go home and celebrate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen this is done, I\u2019m going to find me a woman. No, two women. You won\u2019t see me for a week.\u201d</p><p>Farrah chuckled as she secured her bag on her shoulder. She\u2019d emptied out her tools during the drive and now carried a small, hand-held laptop. With a last, lingering glance at the male face on the box, she emerged from the car. Cold air enveloped her, thick with cigarette smoke and the pungent fumes of alcohol. Farrah walked over to the club, the music growing louder with each step. Her trench billowed at her ankles.</p><p>Her adrenaline was spiking again, rushing through her veins like an awakened river. There was as much danger in meeting her buyers as there was in breaking into a building. But this, too, she loved. There was something so...invigorating about knowing that any moment could be her last.</p><p>Her mom, God rest her precious soul, used to call her a danger junkie. There\u2019d been admonishment and fear in Jennifer Roberts\u2019s tone, but she\u2019d never asked Farrah to stop. Not even when Farrah was caught the first time. Or the second time. Or the third. But cancer had been eating the sweet woman alive, stealing her energy, destroying it, and she\u2019d been unable to provide for her only daughter\u2014for herself. Farrah had quite happily taken up the slack and never looked back.</p><p>Farrah entered the nightclub, scanning for any hint of betrayal. There were dancers, couples writhing together with a fluid eroticism that caused her blood to heat deliciously. Damn that sexy voice! She never would have noticed the dancers otherwise. There were drinkers at the bar, and waitresses hurrying from one table to another, taking orders. All under the constant swirl of multicolored strobes, casting a sparkling shower of pinks, blues and greens.</p><p>No one aimed a weapon at her. No one tried to grab her.</p><p>Farrah paid the cover charge, briefly removed her glove so that her hand could be stamped, and sauntered the rest of the way inside. Per the buyer\u2019s instructions, she headed toward the back. The room was filled to capacity, overflowing with eager, lust-hungry men and women. She maneuvered around them. Manufactured smoke billowed in the air, creating a dreamlike haze. Surreal.</p><p>Not surprisingly, her contact was waiting for her. He was alone, his table pushed into a shadowy corner.</p><p>She knew it was him. Muted beams of light caressed his hand, illuminating a large sapphire ring on one of the fingers clutched around a glass of Scotch. Her heart hammered all the more intently in her chest. She eased into the seat across from him. Without a word, she slipped the photo from under her belt and slid it beside the glass.</p><p>A moment passed without reaction. Another.</p><p>She wanted to ask him why he was so fascinated with the story of Pandora, but didn\u2019t. Early on, she\u2019d learned that questions always made the client nervous. And nervous clients were not good. Most often they became trigger-happy.</p><p>The man gripped the photo between shaky fingers and held it closer to his face. Thick, silver hair glinted as a violet strobe passed overhead.</p><p>\u201cYou may have the item the moment I collect my fee,\u201d she said, speaking loudly to be heard over the music.</p><p>He cocked two fingers, signaling the need for her laptop. She withdrew it from her bag and handed it to him. It was already booted and ready to go. All he needed to do was type in his account number and press Enter.</p><p>The entire transaction took less than sixty seconds.</p><p>He handed her the laptop and she double-checked her account. Sure enough, the million was there.</p><p>\u201cUh, Farrah,\u201d River said in her ear.</p><p>His voice surprised her, and she jumped. Her gaze darted left and right, searching for him. Until she remembered that she still wore the earpiece. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m being followed,\u201d he said nervously. \u201cHad to leave the parking space when I saw I had company. Two cars. Taking turns. I can\u2019t shake them.\u201d</p><p>She cupped her ear with her hand. \u201cCops?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Trying not to panic, she pushed to her feet. The buyer did the same. He was tall, wider than she\u2019d realized. Muscled. For the first time, she glimpsed his features. He was younger than she\u2019d assumed, too. Probably no more than thirty-five. His eyes were big and brown and devoid of any hint of emotion. His nose was straight, his lips too thin but sexy nonetheless. His hair wasn\u2019t silver, as she\u2019d thought she\u2019d seen, but white. Like snow.</p><p>He radiated power. Lethal charm.</p><p>Not allowing herself to show a single ounce of fear, she flattened her palms on the table and leaned forward. \u201cDo you have a tail on my guy?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d was the surprisingly gentle reply. \u201cThere has never been a need for that.\u201d</p><p>He was right. They\u2019d worked together before, and he\u2019d never deviated from plan. So who was following River? \u201cThink you can get home?\u201d she asked her friend. Home, for now, was a motel on the north side of town. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze bore into the man\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to reschedule with you. Something\u2019s come up.\u201d She tried to run to the door, but he stretched out his arm and grabbed her, stopping her flat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving until I have the box.\u201d His tone was no longer gentle, but strong, demanding. \u201cI paid you. I want it.\u201d</p> <p>Automatically, her fingers wrapped around the dart gun at her waist. She didn\u2019t aim. Yet. But her blood pounded through her veins at full speed. A gloss of sweat beaded over her skin. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s impossible at the moment. The box stays with me until my boy is safe. And right now, he\u2019s being followed.\u201d</p><p>The man hesitated for a long while. Finally, he said, \u201cGo to him. Help him. But I expect to hear from you before morning. If I do not...\u201d His voice trailed off. Then he added calmly, \u201cI do not want to, Farrah, but I will hunt you down and kill you. Your friend River will be next. Neither death will be quick or easy. Feel me?\u201d</p><p>He knew their names. She\u2019d never told him; none of her other clients knew. She\u2019d gone to great lengths to keep them hidden. Lightheaded, Farrah nodded.</p><p>The man released her. She spun on her heel and ran. Just ran, shoving people out of the way in her haste. I\u2019m in way over my head this time, she thought, as she flung open the front door and sprinted into the night. This was not exciting.</p><p>Breath burning in her lungs, she hastily searched the cars. When she found an older, unlocked vehicle, she tossed her bag in the passenger seat and jumped inside. She quickly jerked off the dash cover and rerouted the wires. The engine roared to life.</p> <p>\u201cRiver,\u201d she said, \u201cyou still good?\u201d</p><p>Her ear was suddenly filled with the sound of screeching tires, then a muttered curse. \u201cI can\u2019t shake my shadows, Farr, and they\u2019ve stopped taking turns. They\u2019re both on my ass now.\u201d</p><p>Who the hell was following him? She bit the inside of her cheek until she tasted blood. Danger directed at herself, she enjoyed. Danger directed at River...different story. She stomped her foot on the gas and sped from the parking lot. \u201cWhere are you headed? Maybe I can cut them off.\u201d</p><p>He rattled off his location and described the cars.</p><p>\u201cSlow down, okay, and let them stay close to you. Just not close enough to take a shot if that\u2019s their goal.\u201d She made the drive in seven minutes, each one ticking slower than the last. She finally spotted River; he was several cars ahead of her. She also spotted his shadows. Black, nondescript sedans, just like River drove. Their windows were tinted, so she couldn\u2019t make out the drivers. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she said. \u201cI see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d There was an edge to the words, a quiet desperation.</p> <p>I got him into this. I have to get him out. No matter what. \u201cWhen I tell you, make a sharp one-eighty and hop into the opposite lane. Don\u2019t look back, just gas it.\u201d Farrah increased her speed, sidling up to one of the cars. \u201cNow,\u201d she said, and rammed it. One sedan slammed into the other, and her own car was knocked off course, swerving left and right.</p><p>As she fought for control, she heard the squeal of tires, saw River doing as she\u2019d instructed, and felt a wave of relief. The sedans tried to turn, tried to follow him, but she rammed them until they collided with other vehicles, the sound of crunching metal blasting across the highway.</p><p>Farrah didn\u2019t take her foot off the gas, even whiplashed as she was, but continued north. She was panting, her fingers throbbing from gripping the wheel so tightly, and her skin felt too tight on her bones.</p><p>\u201cFarrah? Farrah, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll\u2019s well,\u201d she managed to say without any hint of emotion. \u201cShadows are gone, and I\u2019m on my way home.\u201d</p><p>At first, he didn\u2019t respond. Then he expelled a shaky breath. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe the box, maybe not. Let\u2019s worry about it tomorrow. Right now, I\u2019m wiped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...ditch the car as soon as you can, and I\u2019ll do the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill do. See you in thirty, Riv.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, see you in thirty.\u201d</p><p>He was upset, she could tell. Nothing like this had ever happened before, and they\u2019d done many, many jobs together. Maybe it was time to get out of the business, go somewhere sunny and safe and relax for the first time in her life. River could \u201cbag the babes\u201d he was always talking about. He could work a normal job, maybe start his own computer business.</p><p>Farrah sighed. Yeah, it was time. Past time, probably. She\u2019d miss the rushes, the danger, the excitement, but River was more important. Tomorrow, she\u2019d deliver the box to its new owner\u2014his death threat still rang in her ears\u2014then she\u2019d begin planning a new life for herself and River.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>WHEN FARRAH ENTERED the motel room, she was happy to see that River was already there. He lounged on the bed, flipping channels on the TV. He looked so young, lying there, the stained red comforter fluffed around him, big white pillows under his feet.</p><p>The door snicked shut behind her. Their eyes met, his a worried green, hers a relieved blue. Without the contacts, her gaze would have been a relieved brown.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, locking the door behind her. \u201cSo very sorry.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, he dropped the remote and sat up. \u201cWhy? You did nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI introduced you to this lifestyle. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaved me,\u201d he interjected. \u201cTime and time again.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to respond, but he cut her off with a quick shake of his head. \u201cNope. Not another word on the subject. You\u2019re going to relax, catch some Zs, and I\u2019m going to decompress. There\u2019s a bar about a block over. They\u2019ve got pool and loose women, and as you know, that\u2019s my favorite combination.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed as she crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cYou aren\u2019t old enough to get in to a bar.\u201d</p><p>He hopped from the bed and slipped his feet into his boots, shooting her a wicked grin and suddenly appearing much older than his nineteen years. \u201cMy I.D. says otherwise.\u201d</p><p>True. She\u2019d forged the I.D. herself. But he did not need to be drinking beer, which fogged his brain and made him giggly; he\u2019d proposition everything breathing and\u2014wait. Up close, she could see the lines of tension around his eyes, the tight pull of his lips. She lost her steam. He really did need to decompress.</p><p>\u201cJust be careful, okay. Phone if there\u2019s any trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mommy.\u201d</p><p>She anchored her hands on her hips. \u201cWhoever chased you is still out there, smarty.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his expression growing fierce. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re not going to open the door for anyone, no matter who they claim to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Daddy,\u201d she mimicked.</p><p>Chuckling, he tossed a pillow at her. She easily ducked, the foam bouncing off the door. River was in front of her in the next flash, kissing her cheek.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not back by morning, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve finally found the easy woman of my dreams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least pick one who\u2019s had all her shots.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond, but whistled under his breath as he left. \u201cIncorrigible,\u201d Farrah muttered, bolting the door again. No wonder she loved him so much.</p><p>With a sigh, she trekked past the bed and\u2014stopped abruptly. Her gaze had snagged on the mound of black velvet perched atop one of the pillows. Pandora\u2019s box. Just seeing it made her tingle, made her blood heat and her stomach flutter. But she forced herself to look away, to pad into the bathroom.</p><p>She needed to text the buyer. Should do so now. But...not yet, she thought. There was still time.</p><p>After removing her contacts, she stripped and showered, the steamy water washing away the dark tint she\u2019d applied to her skin. All the while, she thought of the box. What would the voice\u2014her subconscious\u2014say if she touched it again?</p><p>Would only silence greet her?</p><p>Maybe she was crazy, but she wanted to know. Had to know. She wanted to hear that deep, sensual timbre again. Yes, she had to hear it.</p><p>Farrah shut off the water and wrapped herself in a stiff white towel. The long length of her hair dripped down her back. Chewing her bottom lip, she exited the bathroom on a cloud of steam and approached the bed. For a long while, she simply stared at the dark bundle. How innocent it looked...how beguiling...</p><p>Practically in a trance, she stepped forward. She was reaching down...down...but her toe stubbed on\u2014she tore her gaze away and glanced to the floor\u2014her overnight bag. She and River had stored their belongings here early this morning, having moved from their previous location in preparation for the job.</p><p>In and out she breathed. Dress first, and get your silly compulsion under control. This need is ridiculous. Still eyeing the box, she dressed in a pink tank and matching sleep pants. Her desire to hear the voice was a little frightening. Adrenaline was rushing through her as if she was about to break into a heavily armed fortress.</p><p>While a gunfight played on the TV behind her, she reached out once more and clasped the velvet. Slowly she unwound the soft material, inch by agonizing inch. The dark wood finally came into view, and her mouth flooded with moisture.</p><p>Open it, woman. I have lost patience with you.</p><p>Hearing that, her nerve endings electrified. He hadn\u2019t abandoned her. He was still here. But he was no longer seductive, he was now commanding. Wait, she thought, frowning. She was thinking of the voice as a real man now, not a figment of her long-ignored hormones.</p><p>Open it! Do not make me tell you again.</p><p>\u201cThe owner will\u2014\u201d</p><p>Not know. I promise you.</p><p>How tempting...irresistible. \u201cFine,\u201d she found herself saying. God, she was having a conversation with a nonexistent person. Crazy did not begin to describe her. \u201cI\u2019ll open it, but the guy threatened to kill me and the only person in the world that I love. If he realizes what I\u2019ve done, he\u2019ll be pissed and might just try to kill us anyway.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He will not touch you. I\u2019ll make sure of it.</p><p>A shiver trekked along her spine. The voice was fierce, feral, deadly. And right. She would text the owner, let him know the box was safe and that she would mail it to him before disappearing. Even if he decided to come after her and River, he would never find them. They would be long gone, hidden.</p><p>With that thought, opening the box was no longer a question. It was a certainty.</p> <p>Farrah eased onto the edge of the bed and gently placed the box on her lap. The wood was heavy, warm, just as she remembered. The beautiful male face seemed to stare up at her, into her. She untied the golden ribbon and placed her shaky hands over the center seam.</p><p>Open, open, open.</p><p>She slowly raised the lid. Before she\u2019d raised it two inches, however, it was ripped from her fingers, springing open of its own accord. Something\u2014a butterfly?\u2014gusted from the hollowed center, its flowing cobalt wings flapping furiously.</p><p>Farrah watched, open mouthed. Yes, it was a butterfly. But...how? How long had it been inside? How had it survived? As the thoughts poured through her mind, the insect\u2019s wings began to grow, expand.</p><p>Right in front of her eyes, the insect lengthened...lengthened...taking a solid shape. Bright blue wings became bronzed muscle and sinew, scars and tattoos. Piercings and skin. Skin!</p> <p>Shock rolled through her. Shock and awe and disbelief. She rubbed her eyes, knowing the incredible sight would be gone by the time she refocused. Nope, still there. Shit. Shit! She scrambled backward, all the way to the other side of the bed. She hit the edge and tumbled to the floor, knocking the air from her lungs.</p><p>\u201cWoman,\u201d the seductive voice said, no longer in her mind but here, with her. Alone with her.</p><p>Dear God. She jumped to her feet, knees banging together. There was now a man in her room. A freaking man. Oxygen burned in her throat as she studied him. He was amazingly tall, shirtless and ripped with corded row after corded row of strength. He had hair as black and silky as the velvet on the bed. His eyes were the same color as the butterfly\u2019s wings had been, a pulsing blue. Otherworldly. Surreal. They were fringed by spiky black lashes, a deliciously perfect frame.</p><p>His face...it was the face on the box. Savage, raw, elemental. Stripes of blue paint slashed his sharp cheekbones. His nose was slightly bent and his lips were too full, but he was exquisite nonetheless.</p><p>The rest of him, well...she gulped. Both of his nipples were pierced, completely at odds with the butterfly tattooed on his chest, its wings stretching over his pectorals, his collarbone, and onto his shoulders. He wore crudely made black leather pants and well-worn boots that reached the middle of his calves. A silver cuff circled his left bicep.</p><p>He splayed his arms wide and roared. Roared with rage and frustration, relief and need. Her knees almost buckled. Never had she been faced with a more primal, erotic picture: terrifying, yet unbelievably arousing.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re...you\u2019re...\u201d She didn\u2019t know what to say, could hardly breathe. This wasn\u2019t happening, couldn\u2019t possibly be happening. Who was he? What was he? She would have liked to tell herself he was a dream, a hallucination, but couldn\u2019t. Real, every cell in her body shouted.</p><p>\u201cViolence,\u201d he purred in that deep, wine-rich voice. There was rage in his eyes, such rage. \u201cI am Violence, and I am hungry.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, his blue eyes locked on her face, intense, consuming, and she knew, knew, he wasn\u2019t talking about food. He radiated heat. Scorching heat. Blistering heat. A hum of zinging energy traveled the length of her body. Her nipples hardened painfully, and a delicious heat pooled between her legs.</p><p>She gulped. Who he was and what he was no longer seemed to matter. Slowly she inched backward, trying to reach the door without alerting him to the fact that she meant to bolt.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you are going?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Okay, he\u2019d noticed\u2014and he now looked ready to kill her. Farrah didn\u2019t waste another second. She whipped around and sprinted to the door. Locked. Damn it! With her unsteady grip, working the simple lock proved more difficult than the tubular she\u2019d battled only a few hours ago. Finally, though, she made it outside. Cold air bit and nibbled at her exposed, damp skin.</p><p>Panting, trying not to panic, she raced through the moonlit parking lot, her bare feet slapping at the frigid cement. Rocks sliced at the sensitive skin, and she grimaced. But she didn\u2019t slow. The best way to escape him, she thought, cornering the side of the building, was to lose him in the shadows, in the twists and turns of the back allies. When she was totally safe, she would call River and tell him to meet her in another location.</p><p>There were no footsteps behind her, so she dared a quick peek. No sign of him. Good. Maybe he\u2019d decided she wasn\u2019t worth the trouble. As she returned her attention in front of her, she slammed into a hard wall\u2014a wall that enveloped her in aroused heat. She was thrown backward and landed on her ass with a hard thump.</p> <p>\u201cWoman, you cannot escape me. I have your scent in my nose.\u201d</p><p>How had he gotten ahead of her? How, how, how? With a gasp, she jolted to her feet and bolted in the opposite direction, the same way she\u2019d come. Before she managed three steps, he was blocking her path.</p><p>Eyes widening, she ground to a halt. How was he doing that? \u201cWho are you?\u201d she managed to squeak out.</p><p>\u201cKing Maddox. Violence, as I told you.\u201d He paused, peering at her with determination. \u201cThe man who is going to know the taste of you.\u201d</p><p>King? Violence? Shaking her head, Farrah backed away from him. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy. I\u2019m crazy. This is crazy. Just...leave me alone.\u201d With that, she spun on her heel and ran as fast as her feet would carry her. Again.</p><p>MADDOX WATCHED HER GO. He didn\u2019t materialize in front of her this time, for he knew that at any time, with a simple snap of his fingers, he could find her. Oh, yes. Wherever she went, he could\u2014and would\u2014find her. He hadn\u2019t lied. Her erotic scent, a fragrance of wild passion and sweet female, would instantaneously lead him to her location. The beast\u2019s magic gifted him with the ability.</p><p>He was hard for her, his blood a molten river inside his veins. For a moment, one breathless moment, she had looked at him and there had been desire in her eyes. Stark, needy desire that had intensified his own.</p><p>He could find another woman to slake his body\u2019s centuries of denied desires\u2014he smelled several nearby\u2014and maybe he would. Soon. Right now, he wanted that one, with her silky fall of midnight hair, with her dark eyes and lush, red lips. With her delicate curves and siren\u2019s voice. Her breasts and their hard little nipples had been made for his mouth. The long length of her graceful legs had been made to wrap around his waist.</p><p>At the moment, no one else would do.</p><p>Farrah, she was called. An elegant name for a woman of many contradictions. In the time span of a few hours, he\u2019d heard her angry, fierce, tender, teasing, incredulous and afraid. He\u2019d liked the fierceness best. Had wanted it directed at him. In bed.</p><p>She\u2019d stolen his box with a skill that surprised him. Tempted and aroused him. He wanted those expert hands on his body, stroking him to full awakening. Yes, he mused again, he would have that woman. Under him, over him, a part of him. But he would have her a little later. Outside now, he simply reveled in the fact that he was free. At last, he was free from the constrictions of that hated box.</p><p>He was Pandora\u2019s prisoner no more.</p><p>He breathed deeply of the night air, its crisp coolness a caress to his skin. And still rage filled him, consumed him. Such rage. How long had he wished for a moment such as this? How long had he prayed to gods who had refused to listen? Eternity, it seemed.</p><p>A roar gusted past his lips. Fists tightened, he pounded on the closest wall. The entire structure shook. He kicked metal bins and bent the bars of a staircase. He was glad Farrah was not here to witness his tantrum. But he wanted to destroy everything around him. Everything except, perhaps, the woman. Her, he wanted to fuck. Hard and long. Until the rage was spent.</p><p>When he calmed, his eyes closed and he tried to savor the night. He did not know where his men were or what Pandora had done to them when they\u2019d escaped. Were they still alive? He must know, for he was responsible for them. No matter where he had to look or for how long, he would find them.</p><p>\u201cFree,\u201d he shouted to the heavens. Pinpricks of light winked down at him. \u201cFree.\u201d</p><p>Locked away these many years, with no one but the beast inside of him for company, he had finally learned to control his need for blood and retribution. He was still dangerous, still more of a weapon than a man, but he could operate in this modern world. He could, at last, forge a life for himself and his men. A life they had been denied because of one foolish mistake. His mistake.</p><p>He strode back to the room he\u2019d abandoned. As the walls closed around him, he mourned the loss of the outdoors. He hurriedly gathered the box, the material Farrah had covered it with, and her bag. He grinned. She would want that back, he was sure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming for you,\u201d he said, knowing she could not hear him. But perhaps she would feel the warning in her bones.</p><p>He did not know where Pandora was, but he would find her, too. She would know the taste of his beast at long last. He would kill her as he\u2019d dreamed all these years, without thought, without hesitation, heaping yet another sin upon his already heavy shoulders\u2014a sin for which he must atone when the guilt invariably hit him. But he did not care.</p><p>Go. Find the little thief and sate your desires. Afterward, he would begin to hunt down Pandora and his men. One by one. </p> </body></html>"]
