Knock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d I said it without thinking, then realized there was someone inside my head, playing the old joke on me. I jumped up just as the dead bolts flipped and the door to my apartment crashed open.</p><p>\u201cYour favorite nightmare, Glory St. Clair.\u201d Alesa, a demon who could look gorgeous when she wasn\u2019t showing her true nature, leaned against the doorjamb, a grin on her hellish face. Tonight she wasn\u2019t bothering to hide a thing and I shuddered.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not my favorite anything. Go back to hell, where you belong.\u201d I frantically glanced around for a weapon. I was at a serious disadvantage with wet polish on my toenails and a deep conditioner on my hair under a towel turban.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t toss that polish remover if I were you. It won\u2019t hurt me and it\u2019ll do a real number on your hardwood floor.\u201d Alesa sauntered into the room, morphing into her human form, which was a huge relief. Not that it meant she\u2019d act human, but at least I didn\u2019t have to stare at razorsharp fangs or scaly snout and skin anymore. Total freak-out.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I grabbed a nail file with a sharp pointy end. At least I could make her bleed. Oh, wait. Demon blood, black and oily. Infectious. Not a good idea. I\u2019d learned that the hard way.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, sugar plum. Don\u2019t want to get my blood in you again, do you?\u201d She smiled, reminding me that she could read my thoughts without breaking a sweat. She was still sporting those evil teeth. \u201cLast time I got inside you, we did some serious partying.\u201d She glanced down and patted her tummy. \u201cGuess what? I got what I wanted out of it.\u201d</p><p>I gawked. Oh, no. It couldn\u2019t be. \u201cIs that what I think it is? Say it isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA baby bump?\u201d Alesa came closer and I could smell her sickeningly sweet scent, the burned sugar candy smell of hell gone terribly wrong. \u201cOh, yes. When you and Rafe made it, Gloriana, you made it, if you get my drift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s impossible. I\u2019m a vampire. I can\u2019t have children. My equipment died when I died. When Jerry turned me.\u201d I sank down on the couch, my hand over my own stomach. It had been one of those unforeseen consequences I hadn\u2019t thought through at the time. I\u2019d been young and so hopelessly in love with Jeremiah Campbell back in 1604 I hadn\u2019t cared what I\u2019d lose as long as I could live forever with him. Only later, when the lust had burned off a little had I realized my hope for children had disappeared along with my mortality. Tears blurred the room.</p><p>\u201cAw, dry up, kiddo. This is great news. In a way, this baby is part yours, you know. You were my hostess with the mostess while I got Rafe to give me what I wanted. I told him when I arrived here in Austin that I wanted his baby.\u201d Alesa sank down on the couch next to me and I gagged at the smell this close. \u201cAnd I got it.\u201d She looked at me critically. \u201cQuit breathing, dumbass. Vamps don\u2019t have to inhale, you know. Geez, who has morning sickness here, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I guess it was just...\u201d I took a last shuddery breath. What was Rafe going to do? He hated Alesa and sure didn\u2019t want a child by her. A demon child. Sure, he had some demon blood, but he didn\u2019t want to perpetuate that. \u201cI\u2019ve got to call Rafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you do. Call the man and give him the good news.\u201d Alesa leaned back and rubbed her swollen stomach again. \u201cGet him to bring in some food. I know better than to expect you to have anything here. Burgers, fries\u201d\u2014she glanced down\u2014\u201cchocolate milk shakes for the little nipper.\u201d</p><p>I began doing some mental calculations. It had been a tense spring, but a peaceful summer since I\u2019d rid myself of Alesa. That bump was significant. \u201cHow far along are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo the math, Glory. Six months. And I\u2019m planning to stay right here until the little demon pops out. Won\u2019t that be fun? We can be roomies.\u201d She looked around, spotting my current roommate\u2019s computer on the kitchen table. \u201cYou are living alone, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not. This won\u2019t work, Alesa. I have a fledgling vampire living here with me. And I really don\u2019t want her around you. She\u2019s already met two of your cohorts from hell. That was two too many.\u201d I grabbed my cell phone. I did need to call Rafe but I dreaded it. He was doing well with his new club. We\u2019d settled into a nice friendship, though it was still a bit tense since I\u2019d gone back to Jerry, my sire, my always lover. Oh, God, what would Jerry think of this situation? Nothing like reminding him that I\u2019d slept with Rafe while Alesa possessed me.</p><p>I stopped with the phone in my hand and gave Alesa a narrow-eyed look. \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s how you got pregnant? While you were inside me? That really doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSense? What world are you living in, vampire?\u201d Alesa put her feet on my beautiful black lacquered coffee table. Nobody put their feet on that, especially not while wearing high heels, even if they were this season\u2019s Prada.</p><p>I stalked over and lifted them off and pushed them over to my tired thrift store sofa. I had a few pieces of nice, new furniture, courtesy of a fight Jerry and Rafe had had in my living room. They\u2019d replaced the stuff they\u2019d demolished and I was trying to keep the quality pieces in good shape. The sofa? I was saving up for a new one. Prada was actually an upgrade.</p><p>\u201cLook. I\u2019m not buying your story. I think you got yourself knocked up by someone else. Either after you left Austin or before you got here. Now head out. Take your tale to the real daddy. Or let Lucifer take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled and her eyes filled with dark tears. \u201cLucifer? Are you kidding me? He won\u2019t help. He\u2019s furious with me. Because I came back to hell pregnant. He didn\u2019t want me to ruin my figure. Doesn\u2019t want brats running around down there either. It\u2019s an adult playground, he says. Babies spoil the mood.\u201d She wiped her wet cheeks. \u201cBastard. He could care less about my needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, he\u2019s the Devil, Alesa. What do you expect?\u201d I almost felt sorry for her. Except she was such an evil person herself. What kind of mother would she be? And what kind of mother would want to bring up a child in hell anyway? I shuddered. \u201cWho\u2019s the real father, Alesa?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you, it\u2019s Rafael. I\u2019m thrilled. He\u2019ll be a wonderful father.\u201d She sighed and leaned back on throw pillows. \u201cThis is a miracle. A dream come true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. But I\u2019m calling him anyway. He can help me get the truth out of you.\u201d I hit speed dial for him. When he answered, I was suddenly speechless.</p><p>\u201cGlory? What\u2019s up?\u201d His voice was calm and I could hear music in the background. I glanced at the clock. It was still early and the club wouldn\u2019t be too busy yet.</p><p>\u201cCan you come over, Rafe? I have sort of an emergency here.\u201d I turned my back on Alesa\u2019s grin. Oh, but she was loving this, that she\u2019d get Rafe involved with her again and that I was the one putting them together.</p><p>\u201cFood,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cSure. Can you give me a hint? What kind of emergency? Life and death? Or just one of your mini-crises. If it\u2019s one of those, call Blade.\u201d Rafe was all business. Which was the way he\u2019d been treating me lately. It broke my heart.</p><p>\u201cWork with me, please. This isn\u2019t something Blade can help with. I need you. I have company. Someone who wants to see you. Could you stop and pick up a sack of burgers and fries on your way? Oh, and a chocolate shake?\u201d I was getting mental messages for dessert but ignored them. The baby was probably already going to be born reeking of sugar. Who knew what pouring more inside it would do. Bad enough that it had Alesa for its mother.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you didn\u2019t take one of those drugs again? That lets you eat? You remember what happened last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I learned my lesson.\u201d I put my hand on my tummy that could have passed for a minor baby bump itself. \u201cPlease hurry. This is someone you need to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the amount of food, sounds like you have more than one person there.\u201d The noise around Rafe stopped, so he must have stepped into his office. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now, but I\u2019ll feel better when you get here. See you soon?\u201d I gripped the phone tightly, wishing we were back to our old easy friendship.</p><p>\u201cOn my way.\u201d He ended the call.</p><p>I turned to Alesa. \u201cI swear.\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cI swear that if you hurt my friend I will make sure there aren\u2019t enough pieces of you left to go back to hell for Lucifer to fry. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, Glory, get radical, why don\u2019t you?\u201d Alesa widened her eyes. \u201cAnd, remember, I\u2019m going to be a mommy. Think of my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. The biggest favor I could do that child is to make sure he or she never sets eyes on you.\u201d I stomped into the kitchen and plucked a bottle of supercharged synthetic blood out of the refrigerator. I twisted off the top and took a gulp. It wasn\u2019t as good as fresh, but took the edge off. Then I hit speed dial and called my fledgling.</p><p>\u201cPenny, are you working all night?\u201d I\u2019d seen her off to her job at a lab just an hour before Alesa had arrived.</p><p>\u201cSupposed to. Though Ian\u2019s talking about letting me off early. Trey and I may hook up later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Can you stay with him? I\u2019ve got some company. An old, uh, friend.\u201d I hated calling Alesa that, but didn\u2019t want Penny to worry. My fledgling had a relationship with Trey, the shifter who worked for Rafe at his club, and had been spending a lot of time with him lately. I wasn\u2019t going to feel guilty now suggesting she stay with him for her death sleep. She\u2019d done it before and was basically an adult. We\u2019d recently celebrated her twentieth birthday.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. You sound funny. You sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. Penny Patterson is a genius. No kidding. A prodigy with a doctorate and a bunch of other degrees at her young age. Of course she\u2019d picked up on my stress.</p><p>\u201cNot okay, but Rafe is on his way over to help me with this person who isn\u2019t actually a friend. We\u2019ll manage but thanks for asking. Just stick with Trey so I don\u2019t have to worry about you too, okay? I don\u2019t want you to meet this character. We have a bad history.\u201d So much for not worrying Penny. But I really didn\u2019t want her popping in, not even for a change of clothes. \u201cSeriously, don\u2019t drop by. I mean it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhatever you want, Glory.\u201d Penny sighed. \u201cBut I could help, you know. Don\u2019t underestimate me in a fight. Ian\u2019s been working with me. He\u2019s got some amazing weapons here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just bet he does. Thanks, but not this time.\u201d I hung up. Penny worked for Ian MacDonald. The vampire was another genius and had probably come up with some stuff I could use against a demon. But a pregnant one? That had to give me pause.</p><p>\u201cGlory, you know I can read your thoughts and hear your conversations, don\u2019t you?\u201d Alesa stood in the doorway. \u201cCome back to the living room and tell me what you\u2019ve been up to lately. Who is this Penny?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike I\u2019d confide in you? Forget Penny. Sit on the sofa and wait for your food.\u201d I finished my synthetic and rinsed out the bottle for the recycle bin. Good thing I didn\u2019t need to inhale, because the sweet stench of hell would have put me off my drink completely. When I heard the knock on the door, I realized I still had a turban on my head and no makeup. Swell. The only upside of this is that Alesa\u2019s news was bound to take my looks completely off Rafe\u2019s radar. At least my jeans were clean and hugged my butt and my T-shirt was a flattering red color.</p><p>I walked to the door, aware of Alesa\u2019s eyes following me. She had a smirk on her face that made me want to slap her. My stomach knotted as I threw the dead bolts.</p><p>\u201cI could smell demon from the bottom of the stairs, Gloriana. What the hell is going on here?\u201d Jeremy Blade, my lover and my maker, strode into the room. He stopped at the foot of the couch and stared at Alesa, who stretched as if to show off her plump breasts in her low-cut violet sweater. He didn\u2019t seem to notice, busy pulling one of his knives out of his boot.</p><p>\u201cJerry, stop. You know you can\u2019t kill a demon with a knife.\u201d I put my hand on his arm. I wasn\u2019t sure what it took to kill a demon. Everything we\u2019d tried had failed. They seemed indestructible. The most you could hope to do in a fight was to send them back to hell and it took a priest or other type of holy man and some other powerful stuff for that.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but I could enjoy trying.\u201d Jerry wasn\u2019t about to put his knife away. \u201cWhat\u2019s this bitch doing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCausing trouble, what else?\u201d I pulled Jerry toward the kitchen. \u201cAlesa, don\u2019t say a word. Please. Let me handle this.\u201d I gave her a look that she actually heeded. She just sat back with a smile and a wave.</p><p>\u201cHandle what? Me?\u201d Jerry looked down at my hand on his arm. \u201cI thought we were finally done with demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I.\u201d I sighed and leaned against him once I had him in the kitchen. Jerry and I had been through some really rough times. He\u2019d managed to forgive me for betraying him with Rafe, who was part demon. I\u2019d blamed my infidelity on Alesa being inside me. Demon tricks. Then other demons had come back and made more mischief in our lives. Through it all, Jerry had been there for me.</p><p>I held on to him. He\u2019d positively hate this latest development, but he\u2019d see it as nothing to do with us. Rafe had a problem, end of story. I was going to have a fight on my hands if I wanted to help see my friend through this. And I was determined to do just that.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant, Jer.\u201d I looked up when I said this. To gauge Jerry\u2019s reaction.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you say.\u201d He slid his knife back into his boot. \u201cWhy\u2019d she show up here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe claims it\u2019s Rafe\u2019s child. Made while she was inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a cock-and-bull story if I ever heard one.\u201d Jerry shook his head. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t corporeal. And you...\u201d He hugged me. \u201cSorry, lass, but you\u2019ve got to know you can\u2019t conceive a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. I said the same thing to her. But here she is, stomach swollen, claiming Lucifer kicked her out for being pregnant and saying it\u2019s Rafe\u2019s.\u201d I pushed back. \u201cHe\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet them hash this out, demon to demon.\u201d Jerry watched me with narrowed eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that.\u201d I sighed. Now it started. Jerry would never understand the depth of my attachment to Rafe, the man who had guarded me for five long years. He\u2019d risked his life for me and shared secrets that I\u2019d told no one else. I loved Rafe. Just as I loved Jerry. Well, maybe not just as. Jerry and I had a long and turbulent history, four hundred years\u2019 worth. Rafe and I were friends, briefly lovers and equals in a way Jer and I could never be.</p><p>\u201cYou could leave them to it, but you won\u2019t.\u201d Jerry turned to stare into the living room. \u201cI see no way for this to be resolved without you getting hurt.\u201d He faced me again and shook his head. \u201cDemons play dirty, you know that. Alesa will make sure you have naught to do with Rafael if she wants him for her babe\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Yet here she is. At my home, asking for my help.\u201d I bit my lip. Was I being set up? Alesa hated me. I\u2019d humiliated her in her world, keeping her trapped in my body far longer than most hosts would have managed, according to the other demons I\u2019d met. And Lucifer wasn\u2019t crazy about me either. Had he sent her here to get even with me? I\u2019d managed to best him the last time we\u2019d met. I knew he\u2019d been pissed off about that. And when you pissed off the Devil...</p><p>\u201cTell her to leave. To take her brat and deal with Valdez elsewhere.\u201d Jerry grabbed my shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll be safe.\u201d</p> <p>We both turned at the knock on the door. I really needed to breathe. I\u2019d missed the smell warning of Jerry\u2019s arrival and now Rafe had managed to sneak up on me.</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s here now. Let\u2019s see how this plays out.\u201d I touched Jerry\u2019s cheek. \u201cNo matter what, please don\u2019t pull out a knife again. That will only make things worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got two demons in your home and another one on the way. How could things get worse, Gloriana?\u201d Jerry strode toward the door.</p><p>He just had to ask, didn\u2019t he?</p><p>Two</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is a demon doing here?\u201d Rafe asked as soon as I got the door open.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I said.\u201d Jerry grabbed the sacks of fast food and took them into the living room. \u201cI can guess who these are for. Don\u2019t breathe, Gloriana, you know this food is torturing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d I followed him, helpless as I inhaled salt and fat anyway. I couldn\u2019t keep back a moan. \u201cI swear I would kill for a french fry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sharing, even if you could eat real food.\u201d Alesa smirked. \u201cI\u2019m starved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lucky anyone bothered to get that for you, demon. Glory never should have let you in the door.\u201d Jerry dropped the sacks on my coffee table.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell Rafe who it was for. And I had to let her in. She threatened me and I know she can follow through, Jerry.\u201d I snatched the large chocolate shake from Rafe to get a whiff of chocolate and ice cream. Too bad someone who didn\u2019t deserve it was getting this pleasure.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Rafe had just spotted Alesa, who still lay stretched out on the sofa. \u201cCall a priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it, lover boy. And you won\u2019t want a priest once you see the gift I brought you.\u201d Alesa patted her tummy. Demon magic. She now wore a pink maternity top with silver letters and an arrow that said \u201cBaby,\u201d in case there was any confusion about why her stomach was the size of a soccer ball.</p><p>Rafe looked at me, then Blade. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d Alesa got to her feet, suddenly flashing red eyes and fangs. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant, Rafael. With your child. You\u2019re going to be a daddy. Deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, hell no. You\u2019re lying.\u201d Rafe put up his hands and backed away from her. \u201cI never slept with you. Not in hundreds of years anyway. We\u2019ve had this conversation. You couldn\u2019t pay me to fuck you this century, demon, and that\u2019s a fact.\u201d</p><p>Alesa\u2019s eyes brimmed with tears. \u201cNo reason to be mean about it. And get a clue. You did sleep with me. When I was inside Glory here. You two went at it like sex-starved teenagers. See it all the time down there in hell. It\u2019s one of Lucifer\u2019s favorite shows\u2014Nymphos Gone Wild.\u201d Alesa rolled her eyes. \u201cQuantity not quality, if you ask me. But no one ever does.\u201d She glanced at Jerry and back to Rafe. Both men looked ready to blow.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Alesa.\u201d I didn\u2019t have to read Jerry\u2019s mind to know she\u2019d painted a picture for him that I\u2019d never be able to erase with words. In moments she\u2019d undone months of work to get our relationship back on track. I itched to strangle her until she couldn\u2019t wheeze out one more incriminating word. But among her nasty powers was the ability to freeze me where I stood. Her gaze flicked over me and a jolt of her power hit me like a lash.</p><p>\u201cWhat Glory and I did had absolutely nothing to do with you, demon. And the idea that you somehow witnessed our lovemaking sickens me.\u201d Rafe just had to say that. I didn\u2019t dare look at Jerry.</p><p>Alesa smirked at me. \u201cSorry. Lovemaking. Guess bunnies in heat call it that too.\u201d She poked Rafe in the middle of his black and red N-V T-shirt. \u201cAnd your swimmers obviously still have what it takes to make a baby.\u201d She waved a hand down to her stomach. \u201cExhibit A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. I don\u2019t have to listen to this.\u201d Jerry headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cJerry, wait.\u201d I grabbed his arm. \u201cYou knew what happened. Alesa\u2019s exaggerating. It wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me the excuses, Gloriana. I don\u2019t want to hear them.\u201d Jerry looked down to where I held his arm. His muscles flexed under his short-sleeve shirt. I could see them tighten in his jaw too. He avoided looking at Rafe. That was progress. In the past, he\u2019d have lunged for my friend and pounded him again for what we\u2019d done. Thank God he\u2019d never lay a finger on a woman, but I could see in his eyes that he wanted to flatten Alesa for reminding him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJerry, please. You know I love you. I thought we\u2019d gotten past this.\u201d I tried to pull him into the kitchen for a little privacy. He let me take him as far as the dining area.</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re going to tell Valdez to take this elsewhere, we\u2019re obviously not past this. Am I wrong?\u201d Jerry looked me in the eyes, daring me to tell Rafe to take his demon and go somewhere, anywhere but here, to thrash this out.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just turn my back on this. I was there, involved. Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d I let go of his arm. Honestly, I was the one who\u2019d made love with Rafe. If that somehow got him tied to Alesa, didn\u2019t that make me an accomplice or something?</p><p>\u201cGloriana, obviously the demon manipulated things. Is still determined to manipulate all of us. Don\u2019t let her.\u201d Jerry put his hand on my chin and made me look at him again. \u201cI\u2019m calm now. I\u2019m here for you. Actually feeling sorry for the poor bastard.\u201d He jerked his head toward Rafe.</p> <p>I heard a grumble from Rafe in the living room.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jerry.\u201d I smiled with relief to hear him being so sensible. Before he\u2019d made me look into his eyes, I\u2019d been staring at his chest, at the white cotton shirt that was unbuttoned just enough to make me want to finish the job. I doubt if he\u2019d done that deliberately, Jerry didn\u2019t think that way. But it worked just the same. He looked sexy to me, always had. But that wasn\u2019t why I was determined to salvage our relationship.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Valdez\u2019s problem, not yours.\u201d Jerry pulled me close. \u201cStay out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a few minutes to think. This was big news.\u201d I felt Alesa and Rafe waiting and tugged Jerry back into the living room. Rafe clearly wanted me to let Jerry take off. Alesa wanted Rafe to herself. I wasn\u2019t about to go with either of those options.</p><p>\u201cThink about this. It sounds like from what I heard just now that you were a victim. That when Alesa possessed you it was part of the demon\u2019s plan to use Valdez as a sperm donor. Everything is clear to me now. Obviously you never really wanted Valdez; the demon worked her wiles to attract you to him. So she could have his baby.\u201d Jerry grabbed onto this theory like a life raft that could save our relationship. And it was tempting to go with it. But not the truth. I knew the attraction had been alive and well without Alesa along for the ride.</p> <p>Rafe had a wry look on his face when I glanced at him. \u201cYou going to say you never wanted me, Glory? Go ahead. Let Blade finally feel less threatened by the shifter he hired as your bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThreatened? By God, the day a shifter makes me shake in my boots is the day I walk into the sun.\u201d Jerry\u2019s look was pure Highland arrogance.</p><p>\u201cSettle down, both of you.\u201d I sighed. \u201cLook, I can\u2019t lie about it, even if it would make my life much less complicated.\u201d I rested my hand on Jerry\u2019s sleeve. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I was drawn to Rafe long before Alesa came on the scene. I hate to hurt you like this, Jerry, but that\u2019s the God\u2019s honest truth. Yes, Rafe and I are friends, but there were sparks between us, chemistry, that Alesa had nothing to do with.\u201d It felt good to get that off my chest. Stupid maybe, but good. Jerry could usually see through my lies anyway.</p><p>\u201cChemistry? Well, you can just forget scratching that itch, Glory St. Clair. Rafe is off limits now. He\u2019s mine.\u201d Alesa growled and pushed into our circle, resting a claw on Rafe\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re starting a family.\u201d</p><p>Rafe was on the other side of the room before any of us could blink. \u201cYours?\u201d He couldn\u2019t have looked more disgusted. \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of kinky scenario you\u2019ve worked up in your warped brain, but I\u2019m not and never will be yours, Alesa. Get it?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m sorry, Glory. Blade\u2019s right about one thing. I need to get her out of here. You don\u2019t deserve to have her polluting your atmosphere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do what with her, Rafe?\u201d I stayed out of claw range. \u201cAlesa, have some pride. He doesn\u2019t want you. Give it up, girl. Take this mythical baby bump and peddle your story somewhere else. You have to know we\u2019re not buying it.\u201d</p> <p>Alesa\u2019s eyes filled with tears that oozed, dark and slimy, down her face. \u201cIt\u2019s not mythical. This baby\u2019s real. And I have nowhere else to go. Rafael is the father.\u201d She glared at him where he stood rigid against the door out to the hall. \u201cObviously he plans to be a deadbeat dad. No surprise there. Demons are notorious. What was I thinking?\u201d She sniffed and wiped her nose on the back of her hand. \u201cMaybe I should go to your grandfather, Rafael. What will he say when I lay this story on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou leave my family out of this.\u201d Rafe shoved away from the door. He looked as scary as I\u2019d ever seen him.</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Rafe. I think we need more information.\u201d I jumped between them. I didn\u2019t like the idea of a fight with a pregnant woman involved no matter how I despised her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. Demon or not, you need to step up if the babe is yours.\u201d Jerry stared at Alesa\u2019s stomach. \u201cThough I can\u2019t credit how it could be possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. It\u2019s a damned fairy tale.\u201d Rafe hit his leg with his fist.</p><p>\u201cThink what you like. Food\u2019s getting cold.\u201d Alesa huffed and pulled open a sack to unwrap one of the hamburgers. \u201cI\u2019m starved and all this drama\u2019s not good for the baby. Sit down, everyone. I need to eat. I\u2019m getting woozy.\u201d</p><p>I looked from Jerry to Rafe. To my surprise, they both seemed inclined to follow Alesa\u2019s suggestion. They each took a chair, staring hard at the demon as she wolfed down two burgers and a large order of fries. By the time she slurped down her chocolate shake, I was ready to scream.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe a word you\u2019ve said since you walked in that door.\u201d I\u2019d pulled Penny\u2019s computer chair over to the living room while Alesa ate. Now when I jumped up it rolled back until it slammed against a bookshelf. I stomped over to stand next to the couch.</p> <p>\u201cTough. I\u2019m telling the truth. Deal with it.\u201d Alesa licked chocolate off her lips.</p><p>I reached down and jerked up her shirt. Well damn. Her stomach really was swollen, looking like pictures of pregnant women I\u2019d seen in magazines, the ones who\u2019d worn bikinis to proudly show off their tummies.</p><p>\u201cSatisfied?\u201d Alesa grinned and pulled down her stretchy maternity pants so we could see her stomach all the way to the edge of her tiny panties and her Brazilian wax job. \u201cLittle Rafael here is growing every day. Kicking and everything. I\u2019ve been reading up on it. He\u2019s right on schedule.\u201d</p><p>Little Rafael. I might throw up. No way had this really happened. I shook my head and must have looked as bad as I felt because Blade was suddenly on one side of me and Rafe on the other, both of them carefully easing me toward my bedroom.</p><p>\u201cGet a cool cloth for her face. I think she\u2019s going to pass out,\u201d Rafe ordered.</p><p>\u201cYou get it. I\u2019m taking off her shoes and unsnapping her jeans. She always wears them too tight. And what the hell is this on her head?\u201d Jerry reached for my turban.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s conditioning her hair. Does it about twice a year. Don\u2019t mess with it.\u201d Rafe obviously had gone for the washcloth because the next thing I knew I was on the bed, shoes off, pants unzipped and something wet on my face.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, sweetheart?\u201d Jerry held my hand.</p><p>\u201cDid I pass out?\u201d I blinked up at him after I pulled off the washcloth.</p><p>\u201cYes, you did.\u201d Rafe stood right behind Jerry. \u201cAlesa\u2019s still on your sofa. I\u2019ll get her out of here if I have to carry her. I figure this is my mess, I\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. When she originally came to Austin to find you, she was spouting nonsense about an anniversary. That\u2019s how she got inside Gloriana in the first place. This all started with you and an ill-advised alliance with the demon.\u201d Jerry squeezed my hand.</p><p>\u201cI know. I married her when I was young and stupid. Got the thing annulled as fast as I could.\u201d Rafe glanced toward the living room. \u201cAlesa\u2019s just stubborn enough to refuse to accept that. But she\u2019ll have to accept that Glory\u2019s no part of this latest scam of hers. Somehow I\u2019ll make this go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d Jerry nodded. \u201cYou have to admit Valdez is doing the right thing, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe, you know you can\u2019t just send her away, not without the truth. If it could be your child... Well, scam or not, I\u2019m helping you sort this out.\u201d I held my other hand out to Rafe. \u201cWhat we need is a DNA test. Call Ian MacDonald. He should know if there\u2019s a way to do it before the baby\u2019s born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat idea. I\u2019ll get on it.\u201d Rafe took my hand and kissed my palm, ignoring Jerry\u2019s growl. \u201cYou really don\u2019t have to be involved, Glory. For now, I\u2019ll put Alesa up in a hotel. Don\u2019t worry about her. How much longer has she got?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says three more months. If demons take the usual nine like humans do.\u201d I sighed. That sounded like an eternity.</p><p>\u201cYes, they do.\u201d Rafe frowned. \u201cShe\u2019s sure not staying with you and Penny, I don\u2019t care what she says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I closed my eyes. Fainting wasn\u2019t my thing, but it had come in handy this time. The guys were at least moving forward together. Well, not together, but Rafe was getting Alesa out of the apartment\u2014I knew the exact moment when the hall door closed behind them both\u2014and that made Jerry happy. Now I just hoped that a DNA test would prove her claim was a ridiculous lie. Had to be. How could she conceive in my dead womb? Didn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>\u201cShe and Valdez are gone. Now quit playing possum and open your eyes, Gloriana. Talk to me about this chemistry between you and the shifter.\u201d</p><p>My eyes popped open. \u201cOver. Done with. An experiment that failed. We decided we\u2019re better as just friends, nothing more.\u201d I sat up and touched his cheek. \u201cDid you feel that? The zing we get every time we touch? Now that\u2019s chemistry.\u201d I pulled his head down to mine. \u201cKiss me. Remind me why I keep coming back to you century after century.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCould it be you just like my... broadsword?\u201d Jerry chuckled as he jerked the towel off my head. \u201cValdez was right. I shouldn\u2019t have disturbed your \u2018conditioning.\u2019 Do you need to jump in the shower and wash this mess off?\u201d</p><p>I smiled against his mouth as I kissed him. Oh, but I loved the taste of him. \u201cYes, I believe I do. Why don\u2019t you join me? We can play conquering the castle. You can use your... sword.\u201d I gasped as he pulled me up and into his arms to carry me to the bathroom. I had learned over the years how to distract Jerry when I needed to. Of course he was still smarting from Alesa\u2019s vivid reminder that Rafe and I had had hot monkey sex six months ago. So I\u2019d show Jerry the best way I knew how that I still loved my sire and that my time with Rafe was ancient history, hadn\u2019t changed a thing in my relationship with Jerry.</p><p>But something I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on had changed. Yes, I loved Jerry, but I realized I\u2019d become more critical when we were together. Not of his lovemaking. Are you kidding? Jerry could please me in ways no other man ever could.</p> <p>But try as he might to move with the times, Jerry\u2019s attitudes still had that eau de ancient male that could drive me crazy. Which was ridiculous. Rafe was even more ancient, according to a calendar. So why...? Maybe it was because Rafe hadn\u2019t known me back in the day. He\u2019d only met me five years ago. So he treated me differently. Like the new Glory. Who could run her own business, balance her checkbook and shape-shift now without freaking out. Jerry\u2019s knee-jerk reaction still was always to try to save the helpless Glory he\u2019d first met. So not cool.</p><p>Well, I couldn\u2019t think about that stuff now. Not when Jerry was soaping my body and taking a fine long time with it.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, my lord! How did you enter the castle?\u201d I backed against the tile wall as the water sprayed our bodies. I took a moment to appreciate his in all its masculine beauty. Sigh.</p><p>\u201cSome careless soldier left the postern gate unguarded, madam. Now you must surrender your body or I will kill all within these walls.\u201d Jerry growled and held my hands together over my head. He brushed my soapy nipples with his fangs and I shivered.</p><p>\u201cNo! Whatever will my husband say when he comes back from war and finds that I have been with another?\u201d I gasped when Jerry turned me and slid one hand along my side to stroke my hip. He pressed a knee against me to widen my legs.</p> <p>\u201cYou must tell him, madam, that you did what you were forced to do to save the castle. Now open for me.\u201d His voice was harsh as he slid two fingers inside, teasing a response from me that made me shudder. I tried to free my hands, to touch him, but he wouldn\u2019t have it. I felt his hardness press against my backside and the slide of the soap up and down my ass. Oh, yes, he was playing this game the way he liked.</p><p>\u201cPlease, sire, may I not touch you?\u201d I didn\u2019t have to pretend the quaver in my voice or the gasp as he jerked me closer to probe my buttocks with his cock. For a moment I froze, reminded of a time when my shower had been invaded by the devil himself. \u201cJerry?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis I, Sir Jeremiah, leader of the fierce band who has come to ravish you.\u201d He leaned down to whisper a soft word of encouragement. \u201cRelax, lass. I\u2019m here, no other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I must let you have your way with me. Pray, be kind, sir.\u201d I shuddered as his fangs trailed over my jugular.</p><p>\u201cNay. Gentle is for losers. I\u2019ve got you where I want you, wench.\u201d He grasped one of my breasts, his thumb and one finger pinching hard as he slid inside me, filling me until I moaned and bucked against him.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m yours, my lord. Use me as you wish. I will do anything, anything to save my home.\u201d I let my head fall forward, my wet hair trailing to my chest. When he released my hands to wrap his arm around my waist and tug me closer, I couldn\u2019t hold back the scream of pleasure/pain as he surged deeper, pressing hard thighs against mine. He began to move, his arm tight as he kept us together, one hand toying with my breast.</p> <p>\u201cSay you surrender, woman. Say it.\u201d He growled and leaned over me, his fangs scratching my shoulder, the sharp scent of my blood filling the air.</p><p>\u201cI am ravished, completely and totally at your mercy.\u201d I reached back and grasped a handful of his hair, pulling his head to my neck. \u201cDrink me, devour me. I want to be everything to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, my lady. Always.\u201d He roared his satisfaction just before he plunged his fangs into my neck, taking my vein and pulling my life force into him with a mighty draw. The water had cooled, but it didn\u2019t matter. We fell against the tiles and held each other, my back to his front, together in the most elemental ways possible until he finally slid away from me with a kiss and a sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou will be the death of me, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be the death of you?\u201d I turned and ran my hands up his magnificent body. Then I reached around him and turned off the water. \u201cWho shoved into me so hard I almost made dents in the tile? I have a security deposit here, you know.\u201d I managed a smile that widened when he picked me up and carried me out of the tub before he set me on my feet to begin gently drying me.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you? Go too far? I think I took the warrior role to heart that time.\u201d Jerry slid a bath towel around me to pat my back dry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I am well loved and could have called quits at any time. I know that.\u201d I reached up and swiped a towel across his wet hair. I did love him so. Even though I had to admit his warrior had been fiercer than usual. Residual anger? Probably. But he needed to work out his feelings and his smile now was easy and confident.</p><p>\u201cLet me make it up to you.\u201d In my bedroom Jerry pulled me into his lap and gently combed out the tangles then blew my hair dry.</p> <p>\u201cWell now. I never expected you to act the lady\u2019s maid, my love.\u201d I grinned as I admired my reflection. Yes, I can see myself in a mirror, a gift from Lucifer that I expected him to take away at any time. He only gave it to me out of spite, so I could see my figure flaws. That\u2019s why there are no full-length mirrors in my apartment.</p><p>\u201cDid I earn points for pampering you?\u201d Jerry\u2019s grin was wicked.</p><p>\u201cMore than points.\u201d I slid to my knees and gave him attention that soon had him calling my name. Oh, but I loved to make him lose his mind like that.</p><p>By the time sunrise was close, we were both more than ready to crawl into my bed and rest in each other\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cWonder if that baby could possibly be Rafe\u2019s,\u201d I murmured against Jerry\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cIf it is, it\u2019s because the two of them got together somewhere before or after she possessed you. Surely you don\u2019t believe this nonsense she\u2019s spouting, do you?\u201d Jerry brushed my hair back from my face. \u201cYou aren\u2019t having fantasies that somehow this child could be part of you, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t be silly. I know that ship sailed hundreds of years ago. I wish I could have given you a child, but, since I couldn\u2019t, I decided a vampire\u2019s life would be no life for a child anyway. Am I right?\u201d I drew a heart on the smooth skin over his barely beating heart with my fingernail. I never had finished my manicure and had stopped with a basecoat.</p><p>\u201cThere are born vampire females who bear children. They seem to make it work. With trusted shifters and such who watch the babes during the day.\u201d Jerry captured my hand and pulled it to his lips. \u201cYou would have been a wonderful mother. I don\u2019t doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jerry. But how sad. To never get to play with your child in the sun.\u201d I sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s better this way. I chose my life and I\u2019m satisfied with that choice. Alesa is obviously pulling some sort of scam. For all we know another demon got her with child. For some reason she\u2019s fixated on Rafe as the father she wants for the baby but we can\u2019t let her get away with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStupid female. The man obviously has no interest in her. She should move on.\u201d Jerry yawned. \u201cI almost feel sorry for Valdez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you should. Rafe has told me how important family is to him. But his demon blood made him something of an outcast in the shape-shifter community. He\u2019d never want to be responsible for bringing another child with mixed blood into that. If Alesa, by some weird trick, did manage to have his child...\u201d I tightened my arms around Jerry, suddenly very glad he was the man I held. \u201cWell, Rafe will never forgive her. Or let her keep the baby to raise.\u201d I felt the day dragging at me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to be in the middle of a demon fight, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry patted my shoulder. \u201cDawn\u2019s coming. Sleep well.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cNo, everyone loses when demons fight.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>\u201cSo, Gloriana, what\u2019s this about a DNA test?\u201d Ian MacDonald strolled into my shop the next night. He turned more than a few heads. He was a handsome man with a strong build and the bright blue eyes of a genius who missed nothing. He\u2019d always reminded me more of a Viking than a Highlander with his long blond hair and hawklike features. As usual, he had two surfer types along as bodyguards.</p><p>\u201cI guess Rafe called you. How much did he tell you?\u201d I gestured Ian toward my back room. I needed privacy for this meeting and sent a mental message to my clerk to take over the front. Bonnie was a new hire, a local vampire recommended by the owner of the muffin shop next door who was also a vamp.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it, Glory. Take your time.\u201d Bonnie zeroed in on the guards, clearly into blond guys with deep tans. Fortunately there were few customers in the shop at the moment. They\u2019d have a hard time getting her attention away from these two guys who positioned themselves near the storeroom door.</p><p>I closed that door when Ian and I were in the room where I priced items and stored extra stock. It also held a bathroom and a refrigerator for my synthetic blood. I offered Ian a drink but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve developed a new synthetic you should try. I\u2019ll send you a case. Tastes like tea with milk and sugar. Like I drank when I was a lad, before I was turned. Does that sound good to you?\u201d Ian grinned, some of his Scottish roots showing in his voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre you kidding? I used to love my tea that way when I was alive.\u201d I frowned. \u201cBut keep it. Your inventions tend to give me bad aftershocks. That\u2019s why you were analyzing my blood. Any luck with that?\u201d I\u2019d had a horrible reaction to one of Ian\u2019s better efforts, a drug that allowed vampires to eat solid food. It had worked great on Penny. Me? I\u2019d had horrible pain after the meal and still had a slightly swollen tummy as a souvenir. Death sleep should have gotten rid of it but for some reason it lingered. Too bad the food hadn\u2019t even been that great.</p><p>I\u2019d let Ian take a blood sample after that to see what was up with me. This hadn\u2019t been the first drug of his that had given me bad side effects. The scientist in Ian had been eager to explore the reasons why I was the only vampire to react the way I did.</p><p>\u201cYour blood sample is why I came over. The DNA thing is secondary.\u201d Ian settled into a chair while I sat on the large table I used when I worked on merchandise.</p> <p>I\u2019d worn a short black skirt and bright blue blouse that matched my eyes. I hadn\u2019t tucked in the blouse of course. I never tuck, especially not after the tummy thing, but I still felt like I was doing a pretty good job with the figure I had. Ian seemed to appreciate the view of my legs in high heels and the fact that the blouse had a deep vee neckline. His eyes gleamed as he looked me over. I didn\u2019t mind a little admiration from a hot guy.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, Ian. What did you find out? Was there something in my blood that explains why my reactions to your drugs are always so weird?\u201d I unscrewed the top of my bottle of synthetic and took a swallow.</p><p>\u201cYes, there was. You were never human.\u201d</p><p>I spewed. Yep. Blood went everywhere, hitting Ian right in his handsome face to drip on his black knit shirt. I coughed and choked and set the bottle down beside me. I have to admit, Ian took it well. He jumped up and found a roll of paper towels in the bathroom, wiping his face and hair then handing me several to clear up the damage to myself.</p><p>I blotted my face where tears rolled down my cheeks. Swell, mascara leaks. I jumped off the table and walked into the bathroom. I hadn\u2019t heard right. Or this was Ian\u2019s idea of a sick joke. He and Jerry were ancient enemies. This was a MacDonald\u2019s way of getting even with a Campbell. Ian knew Jerry and I were tight. I finished repairing my makeup then stormed out to face the doctor.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, Dr. Death, now tell me the truth. What was in my blood? And don\u2019t give that bull about not being human. I know when I\u2019m being jerked around.\u201d I put my hands on my hips.</p><p>Ian stood and faced me. He was a good foot taller than my five foot five but I had on heels. Still, it was a long way up to give him a hard look. I managed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding, Glory. I wish I was. I ran every test I knew of. Compared your sample to literally hundreds of others from different vampires and humans. I\u2019ve had your blood for months now, you know.\u201d Ian put his hands on my shoulders. He tried to look sympathetic but was more intrigued than anything else. I didn\u2019t like that. It made me think he was telling the truth.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s been months. I figured I was low on your priority list. Penny told me you have lots of experiments going. And then there was your move from California in the middle of that. I didn\u2019t expect...\u201d I stepped back from him. His gaze was too intense. He was reading my mind so I threw up a block. Of course any probe of his mind hit a blank wall, solid as steel.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about a MacDonald versus Campbell feud, Glory. I swear it. I don\u2019t give a damn about the Campbells. I told Blade that. We\u2019ve avoided each other since I moved here and we both like it that way.\u201d Ian gestured to the chair and I sank into it.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not, uh, never was human, what the hell does that mean?\u201d Of course I\u2019d been born to humans. My parents had lived in London. I\u2019d married young to get away from their strictly religious household and, in just a few years, been widowed. Jerry had taken my mortality away when he\u2019d turned me vampire. Before then, I\u2019d been an ordinary female. One hundred percent. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Run more tests.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve run dozens. A hundred or more.\u201d Ian leaned against the table. \u201cLike I said, I compared your blood to humans first. I got samples by mesmerizing some on the street, different ages, sexes, even nationalities. When that didn\u2019t give me a match, I went to other vampires. I even found a blond, blue-eyed English-origin female vampire, similar age. There was an anomaly. You simply don\u2019t fit. So I started on other paranormals\u2014the fae, shape-shifters, weres\u2014to see if that\u2019s what you could have been before you were turned. So far, no luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. I have fangs. I drink blood. I fall asleep at dawn. I\u2019m a perfectly normal vampire, right?\u201d I heard my own defensiveness but it kept me from throwing up all over Ian\u2019s expensive Italian loafers.</p><p>\u201cAre you? There\u2019s that tummy bulge you keep complaining about. Penny told me you gripe about it endlessly. Yes, don\u2019t bother trying to hide it. That was just the latest in your weird reactions to my formulas.\u201d Ian caught my hand in the act of jerking down my blouse where it was supposed to do the camouflage thing.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. Jerry would say you\u2019re poisoning me. And now you\u2019re playing mind games. Not ever human? Don\u2019t make me laugh.\u201d I shot out of the chair, unable to just sit still when he was trying to make everything I knew into a lie.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me? Ask Penny. I had her rerun every test, just in case you copped this attitude.\u201d Ian held my shoulders and met my eyes so I could look into his mind and see the truth there.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d The next thing I knew Ian had me back in the chair, my head between my knees. Great. I was turning into one of those females who fainted at the drop of a hat. Well, maybe this was a bit more than a hat drop. More like an ocean liner hitting an iceberg. Okay, I\u2019d always been a drama queen. But this news deserved a three-act play, was Billy Shakespeare worthy. I sighed and pushed his hands off me before I sat up.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Ian. I have memories of my human life. I had parents, a husband, worked at the Globe for crying out loud.\u201d I saw my hands shaking. There. Human hands, no weird claws or... My mind froze. Ian took them, holding them tight. He was on his knees in front of me, staring into my eyes like he could will me to his way of thinking. I looked away, not about to be whammied into something.</p><p>\u201cWe both know how false memories can be planted, Glory. It\u2019s possible those things never happened to you. That your life before you met Blade wasn\u2019t what you think.\u201d Ian sighed and stood. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if you don\u2019t like what you hear, but I\u2019m just reporting what I found.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think Jerry would have noticed when he met me if I was something other than...?\u201d I swallowed. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think so.\u201d Ian stared down at me, studying me like I was a really interesting lab rat. \u201cPenny has told me the story about how you met Campbell. Some romantic nonsense.\u201d Ian smiled. \u201cSeems he was struck by Cupid\u2019s arrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mock what you obviously don\u2019t understand.\u201d I pressed my hands to my eyes. What did this mean? How could it possibly be true?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Love that could last for centuries sounds like a magic spell or an obsession.\u201d Ian snapped his fingers. \u201cMaybe I should try to find a druid. Legend has it that they\u2019re extinct, but I know better. Ireland. That\u2019s where\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it! I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d I held my hand to my stomach, still not sure I wasn\u2019t going to hurl as I faced him on rubbery legs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s science, Glory. Believe that. Now I want to take a new blood sample from you. Compare it to more entities. I know what you\u2019re not, but I\u2019m determined to figure out what you are. Or rather were.\u201d The bastard actually looked intrigued, still studying me with a clinical detachment that made me squirm. He stepped closer and sniffed me.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t smell like a demon, I know that. I\u2019m way too familiar with their reek.\u201d I put a hand in the middle of his firm stomach and pushed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Not demon. I already compared your blood to a demon anyway. Well, to Valdez, who is part demon as you know. He didn\u2019t want to give me his blood until I told him it was to help you. Interesting relationship you two have.\u201d Ian tapped his chin and looked at me. I wasn\u2019t about to share so he went on. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ve never had such a challenge. I\u2019m determined to solve this puzzle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwell. Glad to be entertaining.\u201d I collapsed on the chair again, not up to standing. \u201cWhat other paranormals haven\u2019t you tested besides a druid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny says you know a Siren. Is she still around?\u201d Ian pulled a small notebook and pen out of his jeans pocket. Of course he was going to take notes. Penny had stacks of similar notebooks in the apartment. Now I really was a glorified lab rat. Glory-fied. I bit back a hysterical giggle.</p><p>\u201cAggie. Yes, sure. Why not a god while you\u2019re at it? Maybe I\u2019m Zeus\u2019s girlfriend, on break from Olympus. Sometimes Aggie\u2019s boss, the Storm God, hangs around the lakes here. Bet he\u2019d love to give you a blood sample.\u201d I did laugh then and earned a sharp look from Ian.</p><p>\u201cYou need one of my vampire tranquilizers, Glory?\u201d He reached into his pocket.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you. With my luck, it would do the opposite. Send me into a frenzy and then make my thighs explode into massive drumsticks.\u201d I leaned back and closed my eyes. \u201cGod, Ian, this is crazy.\u201d I felt his hand on my shoulder and looked up at him. Sympathy. It made me want to lean against him and sob. Nope. If I started, I might not be able to stop.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to cover all avenues of investigation, Glory.\u201d Ian squeezed my shoulder then stepped back, pen in hand. \u201cYou want to give me the Siren\u2019s number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call her.\u201d I sighed, my mind whirling. \u201cAnyone else? I still think you\u2019re wrong. I remember my mother and father. Too many details to be faked. Dad was a baker. My mother...\u201d I cleared my throat. Details. Were there really so many? I tried to concentrate. \u201cShe read the Bible out loud every night after supper. Does that sound nonhuman to you?\u201d But could I quote any verses? Other than the ones I\u2019d learned myself going to church in recent years? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ian smiled. \u201cPowerful entities can erase your memory and change it completely, you know that. This background you think you have may be entirely fabricated. If we do discover what species you belong to and it\u2019s not human as I suspect...\u201d Ian patted my shoulder again. \u201cSorry, Glory, but you may have to come to terms with the fact that everything you thought about yourself is a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecies? A lie?\u201d I swallowed. \u201cEven my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d Ian put his notebook away. \u201cNow about the DNA test Valdez mentioned. I can do one while the woman is pregnant, but it might endanger the fetus. The fact that she\u2019s a demon makes this even more complicated, though intriguing, of course. I assume she\u2019s a pure demon so I\u2019ll definitely want a blood sample from her.\u201d Ian had the nerve to wink at me. Like we were coconspirators or something. \u201cAs for the DNA test, is the woman willing to undergo the procedure?\u201d</p> <p>I felt whiplash from the subject change. \u201cAlesa probably won\u2019t allow anything that might hurt the baby. She wants it and wants Rafe. The longer she can string this out, the better in her mind. What you said about endangering the fetus just gave her an out. And I\u2019ll have to tell her the truth about the risks. I\u2019d never lie about something like that. She can read my mind through my blocks, anyway.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll let Rafe know. Can you examine her? Be her OB for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I seem to be the only paranormal doctor in Austin, I guess I\u2019ll have to be. I\u2019ve never worked with a demon before.\u201d Ian frowned. \u201cI want to examine her right away, of course, and I\u2019ll definitely want to do an ultrasound. I\u2019ll have to order a machine but that\u2019s no problem. I wonder if demons ever have multiples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwins? Triplets? A litter of demons? Life could not be that cruel.\u201d I closed my eyes, sending a prayer straight to the Man Upstairs. Then I made myself look at Ian again. He was studying me, like he was looking for weird symptoms.</p><p>\u201cWhile you\u2019re at it, see if you can pinpoint exactly when this baby was conceived. Alesa\u2019s saying she got preggers when she was inside me.\u201d I stood, felt the room wobble, then got it under control. \u201cIs that possible? She was just a spirit or something, inhabiting my body, when Rafe and I did the deed. I don\u2019t see how she could conceive that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with nonhumans, I\u2019ve learned anything\u2019s possible.\u201d Ian pulled a small black leather case out of his jeans pocket. \u201cCan I take that fresh blood sample now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCame prepared, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been carrying this around in case I run across an unusual type of nonhuman. But I want a new sample of your blood to see if anything\u2019s changed since I took the first one. Do you mind?\u201d Ian opened the case and pulled out a syringe and an extra vial.</p><p>\u201cNo, have at it. I want answers too. But I do take blood from Jerry on a regular basis. Drank some just last night.\u201d I unbuttoned my sleeve and pulled it up then held out my left arm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you also drink synthetics. Doesn\u2019t matter. Your core type should remain unchanged.\u201d Ian wrapped a tourniquet around my upper arm. \u201cJust like mortals eat rare beef but their blood doesn\u2019t become like that of a cow\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice comparison, Ian.\u201d I winced when he tapped a vein with a finger then stuck me with a needle.</p><p>\u201cOf course ingesting any substance can temporarily alter our blood, like the drugs I sell. Uppers, downers, the daylight thing. But it doesn\u2019t last.\u201d Ian didn\u2019t look at me, just released the tourniquet and watched my blood fill a vial, as if interested in the color.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe you got my sample mixed up with someone or something else\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot possible. I keep meticulous records. Crosscheck everything. And I think you know how I am about security.\u201d Ian filled several vials efficiently.</p><p>Yes, Ian had an army of guards. Whether they were to keep Campbells out or to guard the secret to his various drugs, which were very expensive, I didn\u2019t know or care. After he slipped the needle out of my arm, he wiped a drop of blood from the spot with his finger and tasted it.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve discovered something else interesting about your blood, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The way Ian was staring at my jugular made me wish I\u2019d worn a turtleneck.</p><p>\u201cIt contains special properties.\u201d He moved closer until I was almost lying back on the table. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose you\u2019d let me have a real taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t suppose. Back off.\u201d I used a vamp move to get away from him and onto the other side of the room. \u201cNow what do you mean? What special properties?\u201d</p><p>Ian smiled. \u201cI concentrated one of the vials I took from you before into a few tablets, then ran a little experiment.\u201d He sat on the edge of the table, his eyes suddenly sparkling with the excitement of a scientist who\u2019d discovered something great. \u201cImagine, Glory, your blood actually enhanced my vision, gave me strength and\u201d\u2014his smile turned wicked\u2014\u201cdid great things for my libido.\u201d He flashed his fangs at me. \u201cI don\u2019t know what in the hell you are but, woman, your blood is very, um, compelling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHold it. You took some of my blood?\u201d I kept my distance as he stared at me like I was the hottest thing since Vampire Viagra.</p><p>\u201cI did. In the interest of science. It was a small dose but the benefits! No wonder Campbell wants you all to himself.\u201d He tapped his pen against his notebook. \u201cI didn\u2019t give the bastard credit. But then he can hardly help himself. You\u2019re bound to be addictive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play mind games with me, Ian. Jerry loves me. He stays with me because he wants to.\u201d I stomped over to face him. \u201cWhat is so hot about my blood again? Spell it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. It enhanced all of my senses. I could see things more clearly, hear what was being said a block away, much farther than before.\u201d Ian flexed his hands. \u201cAnd strength. I think I could have ripped that steel door off its hinges without breaking a sweat.\u201d</p><p>My mind was racing. Jerry had never said a word about my blood being special. And my other vampires lovers? They\u2019d been few and far between. Because I\u2019d been selective and drawn more to mortals when Jerry and I had been apart. Men I could easily control and who certainly never drank my blood.</p><p>\u201cWe could make a fortune with your blood, Gloriana. Imagine. Vampires will pay big bucks for the chance at that kind of boost. And all you\u2019d have to do is donate a pint every once in a while. I\u2019d do all the rest.\u201d Ian carefully stowed my blood vials in a padded container and slipped it into his pocket along with his black case. His eyes were bright and he scribbled something in one of his damned notebooks. \u201cWho knows what else we may find it can do as I investigate further?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve listened to Jerry rant about your family for years. Now you think I\u2019d go into business with you? Get real.\u201d My needle prick had already healed so I rolled down my sleeve and buttoned it.</p><p>\u201cJust think about it. You\u2019re always in need of funds to hear Penny tell it and I have even come up with a name: Clarity. Brilliant if I do say so myself. A play on your name, though we\u2019d have to keep you anonymous. Wouldn\u2019t want some nefarious characters like those Energy Vampires to get hold of you and drain you for their own profit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold it. Stop. I\u2019m having a moment of clarity myself. This is a crock. I don\u2019t believe a word of it.\u201d I shook my head. And even if it was true, I\u2019d had enough run-ins with the EVs to know I wasn\u2019t about to do anything that made me attractive to them.</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that.\u201d He picked up his phone. \u201cSend her in.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI have someone in the car who I think you will believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I heard a sharp knock then the door from the shop swung open and Penny walked in. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me Ian has let you try one of his drugs.\u201d</p><p>Penny looked down at her black flats. She was in the jeans I\u2019d picked out for her and a nice black jacket with a green shell underneath. The girl who\u2019d arrived at my door months ago looking like a Goth reject had come a long way. Now she cleared her throat.</p><p>\u201cWe are scientists, Glory. Sometimes we...\u201d</p><p>\u201cExperiment on yourselves? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d I stalked up to Ian. \u201cWhat did you make her do? You know Penny needs this job. Tell me you didn\u2019t threaten her to make her try some of your weirdo drugs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t force the girl to do anything. Did I, Penny?\u201d Ian relaxed against one wall.</p><p>\u201cNo, Glory. I wanted to try Clarity. Ian kept raving about the effects and we\u2019d been doing all these experiments on your blood.\u201d She moved closer and put her hand on my arm. \u201cI guess he told you the bad news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m not human? You seriously believe that?\u201d I sat down in the chair, my legs suddenly useless again.</p><p>\u201cThe evidence is there, irrefutable. I\u2019m sorry, Glory. I wish we could tell you something different. But the good news is your blood is the bomb!\u201d Penny laughed. \u201cI took a small dose and, my gosh, the things I could see, smell, hear. And then I went home and just jumped Trey\u2019s bones. The poor guy didn\u2019t know what hit him. Though he was happy enough to want more of the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much info, Penny.\u201d I leaned back. It was easy to see that Penny was telling the truth. My blood could actually do those things. \u201cClarity. Clever. And, what, I\u2019d just put a spigot in my arm or neck so you both could siphon off what you need?\u201d I waved my hands in a shooing motion. \u201cYou\u2019re both crazy if you think I\u2019m going for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t dramatize, Gloriana. It would be a simple blood draw, a pint at a time.\u201d Ian frowned and it looked like Penny was about to burst into tears.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You\u2019d let this opportunity pass you by? Think of the implications. For science.\u201d Penny sighed.</p><p>\u201cNo, it would be to make money. Right, Ian? I see no great value to science. It\u2019s nothing but another kind of Vamp Viagra. I don\u2019t think so, no matter how much I\u2019d like to be rich.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than just a sexual tool. I\u2019m sure Mr. Blade fills up before he goes into battle, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Penny was flushed, but determined.</p><p>\u201cYou did not just go there.\u201d I jumped to my feet. But then I wondered. Had he? Used me for a jumpstart when he had a tough situation to face? No, surely not.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can work around you. I know you wouldn\u2019t turn my twin sister, but you did turn someone vampire once, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Penny faced Ian. \u201cWhat about using a vampire she made? Would that work?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot sure. It\u2019s possible, I suppose, but a long shot. If that theory held true, Campbell\u2019s blood would be the source, since he made Gloriana vampire. But then we know she was never human so all bets are off on how that affected her blood.\u201d Ian was scribbling in his notebook.</p><p>\u201cWho was she, Glory? Who did you turn vampire?\u201d Penny grabbed my hand. \u201cI realize now you were right not to turn my sister Jenny when I begged you. She\u2019s enjoying her cheerleading, wouldn\u2019t want to miss out on all her sorority activities and normal college life. Being a vampire would definitely screw that up. And if she knew I\u2019d been turned... Well, I am glad you talked me out of telling her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. So trust my instincts now, both of you.\u201d I patted her shoulder then glanced at Ian, who had his pen poised over his notebook. \u201cYou don\u2019t want anything to do with the one vampire I did make. It was an emergency or I never would have done it. I found Lucky Carver bleeding out in the alley back here. After I made her, Lucky turned Ray vampire. A little act of revenge that ruined his life. That\u2019s why Ray\u2019s so crazy to get your sunlight drug, Ian. Yep, the one and only vampire I ever sired killed the famous rock star Israel Caine, then turned him vampire. How\u2019s that for cruel fate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know about fate, but it\u2019s interesting.\u201d Ian scribbled in his notebook. \u201cSo Ray\u2019s got some of your blood in him too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than a little. I\u2019ve had to feed him a few times since then.\u201d I sighed, my brain on sensory overload.</p> <p>Ian winked. \u201cRelax, Gloriana, I don\u2019t want to cut you out. You\u2019re the source, the best option. Keep an open mind and we\u2019ll meet again. When I examine this demon for you. See? I\u2019m doing you a favor, so you\u2019ll owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may need your help with Alesa, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m willing to become your blood donor.\u201d I stalked over, ready to wrench open the door. \u201cGood-bye, Ian. Penny, maybe you need to start looking for another job. This one has some requirements that you need to think about. Like becoming one of Ian\u2019s guinea pigs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no other jobs for paranormal scientists in Austin, Glory. Besides, I\u2019m learning a lot from Ian. I\u2019d never quit.\u201d Penny smiled at her boss. \u201cThink about his proposition. We\u2019ve got a Web site ready to launch. Brochures set to print. Clarity could bring you millions. And make vampires all over the world happy.\u201d</p><p>I hated to see my fledgling sucked into Ian\u2019s world where money was king. Next thing I\u2019d see Penny trying his weight-loss drug. Which would be a shame when she\u2019d just learned to dress right for her size fourteen petite figure.</p><p>\u201cStop this runaway train. I will not help you make this drug.\u201d I saw Penny\u2019s smile fade. \u201cI really don\u2019t believe it will work anyway. Jerry\u2019s certainly never mentioned any effects from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack to Campbell, are we? Yes, he would be unhappy to hear we\u2019re working together. But don\u2019t let his attitude stop you, Gloriana. There\u2019s plenty of money in this, you know.\u201d He glanced around my cluttered workroom. \u201cThink what that could mean. But if you\u2019re afraid to go against your lover\u2019s wishes... Are you?\u201d Ian shoved the notebook in his back pocket and held the door while Penny scooted out of the room.</p> <p>\u201cOf course not. I please myself.\u201d I lifted my chin. Not human. And I had weird blood that Jerry had never mentioned yet drank every chance he could. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. I cleared my throat.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Ian smiled and leaned against the door.</p><p>\u201cAbout Lucky.\u201d I met Ian\u2019s amused gaze. He thought I was just changing an uncomfortable subject. \u201cPay attention, Ian. Don\u2019t look her up. Lucky Carver, real name Luciana Carvarelli, is bad news. She\u2019s a loan shark for paranormals. Last I heard she had the Eastern European territory working collections for her father. Trust me, she\u2019s just tough enough to be able to handle the Transylvanian vampires and squeeze payment of bad debts over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d Ian pulled out that damned notebook again. I was surprised he hadn\u2019t switched to electronic note-taking, but guessed he was still old-school in this one way. \u201cInteresting\u201d seemed to be his favorite word. \u201cMaybe I can send one of my guys over to get a blood sample, ask a few questions. What could it hurt to just reach out to her?\u201d</p><p>Hah! Easy for him to say. I was sorry I\u2019d ever given Ian Lucky\u2019s name. But at least her father had forbidden her to come back to the States. So we were safe from her.</p><p>\u201cJust listen to me for once, Ian. The woman is not worth the heartburn.\u201d I practically shoved Ian out of the back room. He passed a sputtering Flo with a nod, collecting his bodyguards on the way out of the shop.</p><p>\u201cWhat was going on back here, amica?\u201d Flo followed me into the room and shut the door again. \u201cYou look strange. Did he do something to you?\u201d She grabbed my arm and made me face her. \u201cMio Dio, you look like you have been given bad news. That man. He and Jeremiah hate each other. What did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, nothing.\u201d I was tempted to cry on Flo\u2019s shoulder, let it all out. But then what? Dump the whole \u201cI\u2019m not human\u201d story on her? I couldn\u2019t do that.</p> <p>\u201cDid he come over here to get even with Jeremiah about something?\u201d Flo led me to the chair and forced me into it. \u201cWas he trying to get you to take one of his drugs again? Pah! Who needs drugs? I am high on life, I say.\u201d</p><p>I just shook my head, still overwhelmed by the last half hour. \u201cForget it, Flo. He\u2019s helping me with something. For Rafe. No big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. I hope it is worth it. You know Jeremiah won\u2019t approve.\u201d Flo glanced at the closed door. \u201cHe hates the doctor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I wanted to scream, cry, break something. \u201cLet\u2019s drop it. I see you have on new shoes. Tell me where you got them. Was there a sale?\u201d</p><p>I had asked the right question and Flo was happy to chatter away about her recent discovery of an Internet site with designer shoes at a discount.</p><p>\u201cIt is not as much fun as sitting down and trying on. Smelling the leather, touching the suede and walking around the shop, but I adapt. It is so easy, I click on the mouse thing and the shoes are on their way.\u201d Flo slipped off the suede pump and handed it to me to inspect. \u201cAlmost too easy though. I find six boxes at my front door tonight. Six! And I don\u2019t remember ordering but three.\u201d Flo sighed.</p><p>\u201cI have to stay away from that online shopping. For me it\u2019s as addictive as the gambling.\u201d I didn\u2019t have much of a credit card limit either. I rubbed the place at my inner arm where Ian had taken my blood. It would be simple enough to solve my cash flow problem. No, not getting into the drug business, especially not with a MacDonald. I hadn\u2019t listened to Jerry all these years without learning a few things about that devious clan.</p><p>\u201cI can see how it can be. But Ricardo is so modern, I must try to be too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. We should be aware of what makes our men happy.\u201d I handed her back her shoe. And just what made Jerry happy? My blood that tasted like some kind of fine champagne and gave him super powers? I had to talk to him, get the truth out of him. Was he addicted to my blood? Did I really want to know?</p><p>Four</p><p>\u201cNo friggin\u2019 way I\u2019m going to some vampire doctor.\u201d Alesa crossed her arms over her chest and plopped into a chair. \u201cYou fangers stick together. Next thing you know he\u2019ll suck my baby right out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would not!\u201d I was horrified. But leave it to a hellspawn to think of that. \u201cIan\u2019s interested in your pregnancy. He\u2019s brilliant and he\u2019ll make sure whatever you\u2019re having arrives safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to you. Whatever? I\u2019m having a child, Glory. Not a thing.\u201d Alesa blinked back tears. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m so emotional these days. Bring me some of that chocolate ice cream Rafael put in the freezer.\u201d</p><p>I stomped into the kitchen. Yes, Rafe had reluctantly dumped Alesa and five bags of groceries on me right after sunset. I\u2019d insisted he rush back to the club. It was Friday night and he had an important band scheduled to play. Ian was supposed to meet us here for his first examination of Alesa. He was really getting into this and had even ordered an ultrasound machine but it hadn\u2019t arrived yet.</p><p>Now Alesa was playing hard to get. So we were having a meet and greet. Somehow I was going to get her to go along with this. I thrust the pint of ice cream and a spoon at Alesa when I heard a knock on the door.</p><p>I made myself take a breath. I\u2019d quit breathing as soon as Alesa had arrived. Now I could smell who was outside the door. No, not tonight. I thought I\u2019d made it clear when I\u2019d called her earlier to ask a favor that we\u2019d get together later. But, just like all paranormals, this one worked on her own schedule.</p><p>I grabbed the remote and turned on the TV. \u201cLook, there\u2019s Home Shopping. Baby stuff.\u201d I pumped up the volume then tossed the remote to Alesa before I opened the door and slid out to the hallway.</p><p>\u201cNot a good time, Aggie. Seriously. I have company.\u201d</p><p>Aggie wiggled her perfect nose. When the Siren was in human form, she had perfect everything\u2014from her size six figure, tonight poured into a pair of skinny jeans and a teal sweater, up to her long blond hair and sea green eyes.</p><p>\u201cYuck. Are you kidding me? More demon trouble? What now?\u201d She grabbed my arm with nails done in a ruby red. \u201cI thought you sent them all back to hell.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI did. But it\u2019s that demon Alesa. She claims she\u2019s pregnant. With Rafe\u2019s child. I know you don\u2019t want to see her, do you?\u201d I remembered the last time the two had met. Aggie has this great power where she can turn people to stone. It\u2019s her pride and joy. Well, Alesa can do it too. Oh, yeah. She\u2019d stuck Aggie in her place and taunted her. It was not a happy moment.</p><p>\u201cNo way. You called me, you know. Tell me what you want me to do and I\u2019ll meet you somewhere else when that bitch isn\u2019t around. No demon ever again.\u201d Aggie tossed her hair and gave my door a glare that should have sent it up in flames. If it had been Alesa throwing the look, it would have. \u201cMan, I bet Rafe is beyond freaked. But what was he thinking? Sleeping with that skank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t sleep with her. It\u2019s a long story. Baby\u2019s probably not even his. Who takes Alesa\u2019s word for anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I hear that.\u201d Aggie waved her hand in front of her face. \u201cI\u2019m out of here. The reek of that demon is getting to me. What did you say you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a blood sample from you. For an experiment. Do you mind?\u201d I eased her toward the stairs. I knew Alesa had batlike hearing and she didn\u2019t need to be in on this. Luckily I could hear an ad for a wonder diaper that was sure to have her riveted. One change a day? Who wouldn\u2019t be glued to the tube?</p><p>I pulled Aggie to the top of the stairs. \u201cThe doctor is on his way to see Alesa. He\u2019s a vampire, the same one doing this experiment. Would you let him take some of your blood? Just a bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFangs or a needle?\u201d Aggie gave me a narrow-eyed look.</p><p>\u201cNeedle, of course. If he bit you, he\u2019d swallow. It\u2019s what we do, you know. And I bet you\u2019d be delicious.\u201d I hid my smile as Aggie paled. \u201cCome on now, I know you\u2019re not afraid of vampires. You sure showed Ray and me who was boss when we met you.\u201d Aggie had trapped Ray and me in an Austin lake and put us through our paces once when she\u2019d been cursed by an angry goddess. It was a miracle that we were on speaking terms.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I can handle vamps as you know. But I really, really hate needles, Glory.\u201d Aggie shook her head. \u201cAnd why are you helping this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis from a powerful Siren who can make men quiver with terror? Or fall at her feet with lust?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help it. I grinned. \u201cHe\u2019s my fledgling\u2019s boss. Come on, girlfriend. One little stick. Do it as a favor to me. This will help Penny\u2019s career. Cooperate and I\u2019ll talk to Flo. The three of us can go shoe shopping together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the mall?\u201d Aggie\u2019s eyes lit up. There was nothing she wanted more than to have girlfriends. Seems she missed her Siren sisters since she was stuck way over here in an Austin lake most of the time. The rest of the girls were in the Mediterranean, Siren Central apparently. Aggie was being punished and Austin was considered a serious downgrade in Siren terms.</p><p>Flo had invited her to be a bridesmaid in her wedding but hadn\u2019t spoken to her since. Aggie isn\u2019t exactly good company, always threatening to turn you to stone if you don\u2019t do things her way. We were going to have to work on her social skills.</p><p>I felt guilty, playing on her feelings that way. But she\u2019d done some really dirty tricks to me and to Ray, so I pushed down the guilt and went with the plan. And, hey, I would arrange the shopping trip. She\u2019d love it. It would be a nice evening for her, and Flo owed Aggie. The Siren had done a decent job throwing a wild bridal shower when Flo had scraped the bottom of the bridesmaid barrel. My bud Flo doesn\u2019t exactly make girlfriends either. Obviously I have interesting friends.</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019ll hit the mall and every shoe store there. Cute boots. Suede platforms. What do you say? Isn\u2019t a little needle stick worth it for some female bonding? Maybe we\u2019ll stop by Rafe\u2019s club after and you can pick up someone to dance with.\u201d I got her to the bottom of the stairs and punched in the security code to open the door on... hello, Ian.</p> <p>\u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d He smiled and gestured for his guards to move on up the stairs. Aggie watched them go, appreciating the way they filled their tight jeans before focusing on Ian. Her eyes widened and she batted her long lashes. The woman didn\u2019t believe in easy on the mascara.</p><p>\u201cAglaophonos, but call me Aggie. I\u2019m a friend of Glory\u2019s.\u201d She held out her hand. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan MacDonald. I\u2019m the doctor she may have told you about.\u201d Ian raised a brow at me. \u201cI sense that you are a Siren. Fascinating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Sirens are that. If you haven\u2019t tried one...\u201d Aggie did a hair toss and pulled back her shoulders so that her impressive boobs, showcased in cashmere knit, couldn\u2019t be missed. Not that Ian had missed them. \u201cWell, let me say this.\u201d She licked her lips. \u201cWe have a certain reputation for seduction. And we\u2019ve earned it. Google us.\u201d Her smile was an invitation for more than an Internet search and I fanned myself while the two sent each other scorching mental messages. Whew.</p><p>\u201cDial it down, Aggie. Ian\u2019s here to see Alesa. The pregnant demon upstairs?\u201d I tugged on Aggie\u2019s elbow. \u201cI just asked Aggie about the blood sample, Ian. Well? Are you willing to let Ian stick you? With a needle?\u201d I wanted to laugh at the look on her face. She was torn. Fear of needles versus hot doctor. The battle didn\u2019t last long.</p><p>\u201cSure, why not? You won\u2019t hurt me, will you, Doctor?\u201d She leaned in. \u201cBut then if it\u2019s for a good cause...\u201d She smiled and ran a fingernail down his bicep. \u201cI never did get to play doctor as a, um, child.\u201d Aggie as a child? My mind boggled.</p><p>\u201cI promise to make it painless.\u201d Ian grinned, clearly interested. He put his card into her hand. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a patient waiting, I\u2019d definitely be all yours right now. For any games you wished to play.\u201d Ian winked at me.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you two set a date? I\u2019m going upstairs before Alesa takes off. She\u2019s reluctant to let you examine her, Ian. She\u2019s going to take some convincing.\u201d I headed up the stairs. I could hear more flirting going on behind me. Seriously? Did Aggie not care that she sounded like a slut? Oh, wait, that was in the Siren job description. Along with luring sailors to their deaths. Of course that was old-school. Aggie had confided that new technology had made the Siren business more difficult. So her boss, the Storm God, was working on a new game plan. I shuddered to imagine what it could be. A Siren app?</p> <p>Ian caught up with me. He was chuckling as he reached around me to open my door. His bodyguards took up posts on either side of it. He ordered them to stay outside unless he called for them.</p><p>\u201cAggie\u2019s quite a character.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she is. Be careful around her. She can turn you to stone if you displease her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo can I, Doc.\u201d Alesa had moved to the sofa, her shoes off, her empty ice cream carton and spoon making a puddle on my lacquered table.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to be careful, won\u2019t I, Miss Alesa?\u201d Ian set his black bag down on the table then handed me the carton and spoon.</p><p>\u201cWho says I\u2019m going to let you anywhere near me?\u201d Alesa gave me a dirty look when I grabbed a cloth and quickly wiped up her spill. I gave her the same look back. \u201cGlory and Rafe think they can get rid of me and my baby. They can think again.\u201d She used the remote to turn off the TV.</p><p>\u201cIs there a baby?\u201d Ian sat in a chair across from her. \u201cPerhaps proving that should be your first step. That would be a fine slap in the face to Glory here and Valdez. That is who you claim is the father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t just claim that. He is my baby\u2019s daddy.\u201d Alesa swung her feet to the floor and sat up. \u201cYou doubting me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get huffy. I\u2019m offering you a way to prove some things. That puts me on your side, I would think.\u201d Ian smiled. \u201cWatch the anger. It\u2019s not good for the baby. If there is one.\u201d</p><p>Alesa put her hand on her swollen belly. \u201cThere is one. Feel.\u201d She gestured for Ian to join her on the couch.</p><p>I sat in a chair, afraid to say anything as Ian walked over and sat beside her. He let Alesa take his hand and put it over her tummy.</p><p>\u201cWell, I do feel something. Let me use my stethoscope to listen for a fetal heartbeat.\u201d He frowned as he moved his hand over her brown knit maternity top.</p><p>\u201cGuess listening couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d Alesa watched him carefully as he opened his bag and pulled out his stethoscope. He fixed it around his neck, put the ends in his ears and began to listen. When he pulled up her shirt, Alesa didn\u2019t object, just let him move the stethoscope around on her taut skin.</p><p>She finally couldn\u2019t stand his silence or the look of concentration on his face. \u201cWell, what do you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of echo. I\u2019m not sure what I hear. Could be gas, could be heartbeats.\u201d Ian pulled down her top. \u201cI need a blood sample. Increased hormones in the blood are a great indicator of pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Heartbeats. Like more than one?\u201d I just couldn\u2019t keep quiet. This was, like, my worst fear. Multidemons.</p><p>\u201cI said I couldn\u2019t really tell, Glory.\u201d Ian pulled out a syringe like the one he\u2019d used on me a few days ago. \u201cI need more information. Blood first, then an ultrasound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa. I never said I\u2019d let you stick me with a needle. Or look up my hoo-ha either.\u201d Alesa obviously wasn\u2019t keen on giving blood. \u201cAnd what\u2019s an ultrasound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax. I\u2019m just going to take a little blood. All you\u2019ll feel is a tiny prick. And the ultrasound is painless, not invasive at all. It will give us a picture of what\u2019s going on in your womb.\u201d Ian pushed up Alesa\u2019s sleeve and stuck her as if she\u2019d given permission. I had to give him credit for guts. I wouldn\u2019t have poked a demon like that. Of course I wondered if he\u2019d ever seen one in action like I had.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. I\u2019m not scared for myself. But I\u2019ve got a baby on board.\u201d Alesa watched black blood fill a vial. \u201cPretty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCareful with that blood, Ian. That\u2019s how she got inside me. Her blood seeped into my open wound.\u201d I glared at her. \u201cHaving her in my body was hell and that\u2019s no exaggeration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWimp.\u201d Alesa smirked.</p><p>\u201cExplain to me how you could get pregnant when you weren\u2019t physically present.\u201d Ian pulled out the needle, wiped off the puncture wound with a sterile pad, then watched as the spot healed. He nodded then carefully put away the blood-gathering gear and this time actually pulled an electronic pad out of his doctor\u2019s bag and fired it up.</p> <p>\u201cWell...\u201d Alesa smiled and sat back. \u201cThis is where I got really clever. I was nearing the end of my fertile time. Demons only have a certain number of years to get pregnant, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t. How many would you say?\u201d Ian began typing rapidly.</p><p>I tuned them out as they talked about demons and life in hell. I didn\u2019t care, didn\u2019t want to know. Because what if that was what I\u2019d been before Jerry had turned me? No, I wouldn\u2019t believe it. I didn\u2019t have that sweet smell for one thing. And my blood wasn\u2019t black sludge. Of course Rafe was part demon and he didn\u2019t have either of those attributes. Oh, God.</p><p>A demon taint might explain why Lucifer had taken a strange fancy to me, though. No. Since I\u2019d been turned, I\u2019d gone to church, handled holy water, done lots of things that my buddy Rafe, kind soul that he was, wouldn\u2019t dare. And Ian had compared my blood to Rafe\u2019s without finding a match. Okay then. Not demon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d Alesa shook Ian\u2019s hand. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTomorrow night if the equipment gets here as promised. Penny can tell Glory where I live and work.\u201d Ian put his pad away and turned to me. \u201cCan you bring Alesa to my house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to do the ultrasound?\u201d I really had spaced out.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said. Are you driving me or do I need to get Rafael, on a busy Saturday night, to abandon his club and take me?\u201d Alesa sighed. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to support a family now. I really think he should tend to his business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a business too, you know.\u201d I didn\u2019t like the way my own interests were being dismissed. \u201cSaturday is a big night for us in the shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have Penny bring her, but it\u2019s her night off. She\u2019s going to the UT football game, to see her sister on the cheerleading squad.\u201d Ian shook his head. \u201cYour fledgling is positively wholesome, isn\u2019t she, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGag me.\u201d Alesa got up and walked into the kitchen. \u201cI want chips and salsa. Sorry you two can\u2019t join me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just bet you are. Do your eating in the kitchen.\u201d I turned to Ian. \u201cI\u2019m glad Penny is going to the game. She needs to do some normal college things instead of spending her whole life hunched over a microscope.\u201d I rubbed the back of my neck, tight with strain. This whole thing\u2014Alesa here, worrying about Rafe, not to mention thinking about how Jerry was going to take my working with Ian\u2014was giving me another headache. \u201cI\u2019ll arrange things so I can take Alesa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. You obviously are feeling the stress of this and your other situation.\u201d Ian nodded toward the kitchen. \u201cI won\u2019t mention it here but with Aggie\u2019s sample and now Alesa\u2019s, I feel I\u2019m close to the truth about you.\u201d He opened his black bag. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose I can interest you in a pain reliever for that headache.\u201d He held out a packet with a pill inside.</p><p>\u201cNo, no drugs.\u201d I rolled my neck. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still not interested in Clarity either.\u201d There was a noise outside the door. Thumps, groans, then the door crashed open.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d Jerry strode over, not waiting for Ian to move. He knocked the packet out of Ian\u2019s hand then shoved him against the wall. A picture I\u2019d really liked fell to the floor, the frame cracking. \u201cTrying to drug her again, MacDonald?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, stop!\u201d I jumped up and landed behind him, wrapping my arms around his waist. \u201cIan\u2019s here as a doctor. Stop acting like a Campbell and listen to me.\u201d</p><p>Ian threw Jerry\u2019s hands off of him. \u201cListen to you? That\u2019s too reasonable for a man like Jeremiah Campbell. No, I forget. Jeremy Blade. That\u2019s the asinine name you gave yourself a century ago.\u201d Ian laughed. \u201cCan\u2019t say I blame you. Who wouldn\u2019t want to be shed of the Campbell curse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you\u2014\u201d Jerry lunged, but I got between them.</p><p>\u201cI said stop. You\u2019re in my home. My rules. Remember?\u201d I looked up and touched his face. \u201cBoth of you. No feuds here. If you wish to kill each other, take it outside. But I need you both, so do me a favor and shelve this ancient animosity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGloriana, you heard him insult me and my family. Am I to just allow that?\u201d Jerry showed all his teeth and fangs. \u201cThe man is asking for a beat-down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems like you took care of your aggressions on his guards. That was not well done of you, Jerry.\u201d I turned my back on him.</p><p>\u201cIan, it was not well done of you to taunt him that way. And there\u2019s no Campbell curse that I know of. Jerry\u2019s always been proud of his family and his name. We all change our names from time to time. It\u2019s what an immortal has to do.\u201d I saw Ian\u2019s jaw flex. He glanced over to where his guards had pulled themselves together and waited in the doorway, obviously for a signal to attack Jerry. Three to one. The odds were terrible.</p><p>\u201cHe never told you of the curse? I\u2019ll leave it to him to explain. And ask him about your blood. See what he says. Should be interesting.\u201d Ian gave Jerry a smile that made Jerry growl Gaelic obscenities I\u2019d heard before. \u201cUntil tomorrow night, Gloriana. Come around ten and don\u2019t bring Campbell with you.\u201d Ian pushed past us, picked up his bag and headed out the door.</p><p>\u201cWow. The testosterone level in here is off the charts and the yelling\u2019s not good for the baby.\u201d Alesa yawned. \u201cI\u2019m going to lie down for a while. Rafe is picking me up after the club closes. About three he said. So can I collapse in the fledgling\u2019s bed till then?\u201d Alesa headed down the hall. \u201cWhy am I asking? I\u2019m doing it anyway. You two obviously need to talk. A curse? How ridiculous.\u201d Alesa laughed.</p><p>\u201cIs it? Ridiculous?\u201d I walked into the kitchen and pulled out a bottle of synthetic. Jerry was right behind me. He shook his head when I offered him one. Right. He still preferred a live donor. Obviously he\u2019d had a drink on his way over.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s ridiculous. The MacDonalds hired an old witch centuries ago to lay a curse on my family. It caused some of my kin to do things out of character.\u201d Jerry ran a hand through his hair. \u201cPower of suggestion. Obviously. It was about that time that my parents began having trouble in their marriage, went their separate ways for almost a century. Then one of my brothers was killed in a skirmish with the MacDonalds. Sheep died. A well went dry. Of course everyone with a superstitious bent blamed the curse. Taken individually, these things happen. Put together, the MacDonalds took credit, claiming their curse had done its job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess one more coincidence was that you changed your name.\u201d I took my drink to the living room and sat on the couch. I quickly jumped up again and opened the windows, letting the cool fall air get rid of the demon stench.</p><p>\u201cIt was a coincidence. I had used the same identity too long.\u201d Jerry sat beside me and took my hand. \u201cI\u2019ve never been ashamed of my family or afraid of some stupid hag\u2019s curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t sound like you.\u201d I took a drink.</p><p>\u201cI also went to London and met you. That certainly turned out better than all right. No curse there.\u201d Jerry smiled and kissed my knuckles.</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d I was putting off asking him the big question. \u201cThat was quite a scene with Ian. I have a headache, but I wasn\u2019t about to take the pill he offered me for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacDonald\u2019s guards tried to keep me out. Were going to toss me down the stairs.\u201d Jerry frowned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think I was going to meekly accept that, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I dropped my bottle on a coaster and grabbed Jerry\u2019s thigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jer. That was not well done of Ian. He has to know you are always welcome here.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand over mine. \u201cI\u2019ll always distrust a MacDonald, there\u2019s too much history there. But I wouldn\u2019t want you upset, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jerry. But...\u201d I had so much to tell him and he had plenty to tell me. \u201cI need to know something. Tell me all about how it was when you first saw me. Back in London. What attracted you to me? How did I appear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is an odd subject. Trying to keep me from getting on you about having that demon here?\u201d Jerry lifted my hand to his lips and nibbled the sensitive skin between my thumb and my forefinger.</p><p>\u201cNo. I offered to handle this for Rafe. My choice. Now humor me. Refresh my memory.\u201d I smiled at him and leaned against his arm. He had on a soft black sweater and it suited him. His jeans were worn and hugged his strong legs. Even his boots were masculine, a rough brown suede probably scuffed when he\u2019d kicked Ian\u2019s guards out of his way.</p><p>\u201cI noticed you at the Globe backstage helping with costumes. I\u2019d come to see a play and went to pay my compliments to Shakespeare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember seeing you there.\u201d Who wouldn\u2019t have noticed the man in a kilt? He was so handsome in a dark, slightly dangerous way. He\u2019d shed much of his Scottish accent since, but back then he\u2019d spoken with a burr that had enchanted me.</p><p>\u201cAnd I saw you, always busy. I liked the golden color of your hair and the generous shape of your body. Will said you\u2019d been trying to talk him into putting you on the stage in a minor part. Against the law, of course, but bribes in the right quarter took care of that and audiences loved to see an occasional female on the stage.\u201d Jerry had his finger wound around one of my curls. I\u2019d let my hair grow long again and he liked it that way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes and it paid a bit more if you could get your chance at it.\u201d I knew most of the women who\u2019d had a turn on stage had wound up mistresses of rich men. I\u2019d been terrified, but desperate enough to risk it by the time I\u2019d asked for my chance.</p><p>\u201cWill told me that your husband had died in an accident and he\u2019d let you stay on so you wouldn\u2019t starve. Looked to me like you weren\u2019t eating like you should. Your face was gaunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I had cheekbones back then.\u201d I sighed. Unfortunately Jerry had fattened me up before he\u2019d turned me vampire. He liked a buxom lass.</p> <p>\u201cI may have given Will a push to let you have your chance.\u201d Jerry ran his hand down my arm and pulled me closer.</p><p>\u201cSo I have you to thank for my big break!\u201d I reached up and kissed his cheek. \u201cCan\u2019t say I did much but wear a shockingly low-cut dress and carry a milk pail, but I got heaps of roses backstage after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t take my eyes off you. I wasn\u2019t the only one who liked your milk pail either. You had a crowd lingering by the stage door that night.\u201d Jerry leaned down to kiss me. He put some energy into it and I almost let the interrogation go. No, I needed some answers.</p><p>\u201cBut you soon cleared them all out. They thought I was a strumpet. You treated me like a lady.\u201d I sighed. \u201cYou had to know I hadn\u2019t been raised as one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that. You were well spoken and had an air about you.\u201d Jerry slipped open buttons on my blouse until he could see my lacy bra.</p> <p>\u201cDid I ever do anything to make you suspect that I was other than what I appeared?\u201d I eased away, not about to be distracted by his clever hands when I had finally gotten to the reason for this trip down memory lane.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jerry stopped with his hand on the clasp of my bra.</p><p>\u201cCould I have been something other than a simple human female? Daughter of a baker and raised in Cheapside?\u201d I stayed frozen, afraid of his answer.</p><p>\u201cWhere is this coming from, Gloriana?\u201d Jerry jerked his hand away. \u201cDid Ian put this idea in your head? By God\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry, why would you think that? And why would it get you excited? If there\u2019s nothing to it, no worries.\u201d I wiggled over to sit in his lap. \u201cSeriously, you remember when Ian took some blood from me? After I had that adverse reaction to one of his drugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoison! Honestly, Gloriana. I hope you will finally listen to me. He has attempted to poison you on more than one occasion. Why can\u2019t you see that? This is all about our feud. MacDonald misdeeds wrapped up to look like a damned curse. I tell you, you can\u2019t trust him.\u201d Jerry stared into my eyes, willing me to wake up and smell the peat smoke.</p> <p>\u201cNo, stop blaming the stupid feud. He tested my blood. He found out something strange. That I, I wasn\u2019t human before I was turned vampire.\u201d Tears filled my eyes and I couldn\u2019t blink them back.</p><p>\u201cBy God! The balls on that man! To drag you into our quarrel. Is no weapon beneath him?\u201d Jerry pulled my face to his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, Gloriana. He\u2019s lying. He obviously wants to hurt you to get to me. I knew you then. I drank your blood before you were turned. It was human blood. Warm, delicious. It was like honey on my tongue.\u201d He kissed the top of my head. \u201cDamn that man to hell. What was he thinking telling you something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all, Jerry? What about when you drink my blood now? Is it just delicious vampire blood or does it give you something more?\u201d I eased away from him, determined to see his face when he answered me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jerry\u2019s face was blank. I knew that look, the look of a man who had secrets or was searching for an answer.</p><p>\u201cSpill, Jerry. This \u2018honey on your tongue.\u2019 Did it also give you special powers? Does it still? And is it why you always come back to me, century after century?\u201d My nails dug into my palms.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, what did Ian say to you? What lies is he filling your head with now?\u201d Jerry reached for me but I was across the room before he could touch me again.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with the feud again. I won\u2019t listen to that. My blood isn\u2019t human, Jerry.\u201d Tears spilled down my cheeks and I angrily dashed them away. \u201cAnd, don\u2019t worry, I wouldn\u2019t take Ian\u2019s word for something that important. Penny can verify everything he told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you say. He\u2019s accusing me of using you for some kind of drug? Is that what he\u2019s saying?\u201d Jerry was on his feet too, his eyes blazing.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the truth? That after we have our sweet nights together and you drink your fill, you are stronger, your senses enhanced and your libido...\u201d I laughed and wanted to slap myself back to sanity. \u201cWell, I\u2019m here to tell you, it\u2019s certainly five star.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop this. I won\u2019t deny you have a wonderful taste and that you fill me with a certain\u201d\u2014he ran his hand through his hair\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t know, feeling of well-being, I guess, call it euphoria. But I\u2019m damned if it\u2019s more than just great vintage vampire blood. And that feeling is happiness, by God. Because I\u2019ve been with the woman I love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither you are fooling yourself or you\u2019re a damned liar.\u201d I collapsed on the sofa.</p><p>\u201cIf you were a man, I\u2019d kill you for saying that.\u201d Jerry stared at me until I looked away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired. I can\u2019t think about this anymore tonight.\u201d It was the simple truth. The only truth I could grasp right now. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve said things... I know you\u2019re an honorable man. Maybe you don\u2019t even realize...\u201d I shut up, not sure what I could say at this point that wouldn\u2019t destroy our relationship.</p><p>\u201cMacDonald filled your head with these doubts.\u201d Jerry\u2019s eyes were dark with hatred for Ian as he sat beside me. \u201cI\u2019m thinking I have a broadsword with Ian MacDonald\u2019s name on it. This time you won\u2019t be stopping me, Gloriana. He\u2019s gone too far. I will meet him and settle this. Our reckoning is overdue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not touch him. Not if you claim to love me.\u201d I put my hands on his cheeks and made him look into my eyes. His jaw was rigid with his fury.</p><p>\u201cOf course I love you. That\u2019s what brings me back to you again and again, not some blasted blood. And you were human, no matter what that bastard told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust... listen.\u201d I took a shaky breath, summoning up the evidence. I\u2019d had time to think about it since Ian had first dropped his bombshell. Not human. Jerry pulled me tight against him.</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is, lass. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m not going anywhere, you ken?\u201d He murmured the soothing words in my ear and ran a hand up my back. \u201cSpit it out and let me call it nonsense, there\u2019s a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only it were that simple, Jerry.\u201d I wanted nothing more than to lay my head on his broad chest and forget it all. But I was ever practical. That much of me I could see as a human quirk. \u201cThere\u2019s something off with me. Even you have to admit I\u2019ve never been a normal vampire. I don\u2019t have the killer instinct. And look how long it took me to shape-shift. Hundreds of years!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit that was frustrating. But only for your own safety.\u201d Jerry shook his head. \u201cStill, Gloriana, you had your reasons. You were just sensitive. Afraid you\u2019d be stuck in another skin. I understood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, it seemed logical at the time.\u201d Seriously, I\u2019d had terrors that I would shift into a bat or something equally ugly and be stuck. Now, I was comfortable that I could get back to Glory as usual, no problem. \u201cMaybe the fact that you came to London and found me then is just more of the Campbell curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no curse. And what I found was an uncommon woman, Gloriana. Warm, generous, with a good heart. Thank God you don\u2019t have the killer instinct.\u201d Jerry smoothed my hair. \u201cWhy did I fall in love with you? I don\u2019t think it was because you were some kind of strange paranormal creature. I think it was because you made me feel like a human man again, not a freak. That\u2019s your gift, Gloriana. A human gift. Don\u2019t let MacDonald convince you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry.\u201d I was determined not to cry again. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Ian trying to convince me of anything. With him it\u2019s all science.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, know this: I don\u2019t give a good damn what you were, I know what you are. Mine. My beautiful girl.\u201d Jerry lifted me into his arms and carried me into the bedroom. He slowly peeled away my clothes, worshipping me with his mouth and hands until he had me naked. Then he stripped and fell on me, seeming determined to claim me once more. There was desperation in him that I hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. Was this about besting Ian in their feud? Distracting me from the blood issue? I didn\u2019t care. I stroked his hair, explored his body and whispered love words as his hands traveled well-worn paths. Yet the paths always felt new and left me trembling. His lips followed, hungry, tender, then ravenous again.</p><p>I never tired of exploring his hard body, tracing the ancient scars there, tasting the special flavor of male that I knew so well and yet never tired of. I nipped at his firm chest, dragged my hair down his muscular stomach to trace the veins in that rampant sex that he could control for as long as I needed him to. I smiled up at him before I squeezed his sacs and took him into my mouth.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you are the witch who cursed my family. You seem to have cast a spell on me. Why can\u2019t I ever get enough of you?\u201d Jerry groaned and reached for me. \u201cCome here, Gloriana. Quit your torture and sit astride.\u201d</p><p>I sat up and threw my hair back over my shoulders. \u201cCrying uncle so soon, Jeremiah?\u201d I grinned and crawled up his body. \u201cSo you\u2019ve discovered my secret. I\u2019ve got you in my power.\u201d Even as I said the words playfully, ran my hands up his sides and tweaked his nipples, I felt a frisson of something, a warning. Silly superstitious nonsense.</p><p>He growled as he kissed me hungrily, then pushed me back to study me. \u201cYou are all woman, Gloriana. Never doubt it. You slay me.\u201d He lifted me and set me on his cock, filling me. \u201cTake me and prove to yourself that this is how we are meant to be. And I won\u2019t drink from you. I\u2019ll show you that your blood is not why I want you.\u201d He began to move, the pleasure of being so filled pulling a sigh from me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJerry, I love you. Please believe that.\u201d I moved with him, running my hands through his hair before touching his cheek. \u201cNo matter what I might be.\u201d Stupid to bring that up now.</p><p>\u201cI believe you. I also believe that you can love more than one man, Gloriana. That\u2019s why that damned demon is down the hall. Don\u2019t think I haven\u2019t figured that out.\u201d His eyes burned as he rose to press deep inside me again. He was still angry. Old wounds, not healed.</p><p>I had no answer for him so I just held his shoulders as his hands gripped me. He surged into me harder, faster, pushing us both to fulfillment. He was right. Perhaps it was my failing, my fatal flaw. I loved Rafe, more than I should. And even Ray if I let myself look deep into my heart.</p> <p>But Jerry. He was here, now, and still my forever lover. I let him see that as I leaned down and pierced him with my fangs, taking his blood to unite us in the way of vampires. It felt warm and right and tasted better than anything. My orgasm roared through me as he called my name.</p><p>Yes, he loved me and I owned him, body and soul. He would die for me if I asked it of him. Those hard thoughts shocked me. Where had they come from? And why did the very fact that he was so desperate to hold me give me such bone-deep satisfaction? What was I? Did I really want to know?</p><p>Five</p><p>\u201cShe really agreed to it all? Unbelievable.\u201d Rafe paced the living room. He looked tired and worried.</p><p>I wanted to pull him down beside me on the couch and say something to make him feel better, smooth those worry lines between his dark brows. Problem was, even with his jaw set and his body fairly humming with frustration, he was one hundred percent yummy male. I couldn\u2019t forget how we\u2019d been together, how he\u2019d wanted me. I kept my hands twisted together in my lap, determined to keep this friendship platonic where it belonged. I was happy with Jerry and that was enough for me. I was one sick puppy if I couldn\u2019t be satisfied with the incredible man I had. My stomach churned at the truth of that.</p> <p>\u201cWell, we didn\u2019t actually get into the DNA test question yet. Jerry dropped by and all hell broke loose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah?\u201d Rafe managed a smile. \u201cI bet it did. The feud still goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to keep a lid on it. For now, we\u2019re just about confirming the pregnancy and, I hope, proving that the timing\u2019s off for this baby to be yours.\u201d</p><p>Rafe put his hand on my shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s a start. Where\u2019s the demon anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s asleep on Penny\u2019s bed.\u201d I\u2019d peeked in on her just before Rafe had arrived. Jerry had taken off to deal with some business after he\u2019d promised to leave Ian alone. It had been tough to squeeze that promise out of him, but Jerry could be a reasonable man when approached with logic. Plus he was Mr. Accommodation right now, probably trying to prove he wasn\u2019t addicted to my blood. I was reserving judgment.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d she agree to go along with using Ian as her doctor?\u201d Rafe started pacing again. His restless energy was wearing on me.</p> <p>\u201cShe wants to prove she\u2019s got a baby on board. I take it as a bad sign that she\u2019s willing to let Ian examine her.\u201d I patted the couch next to me. \u201cSit. Try to relax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, right.\u201d Rafe darted into the kitchen and came out with a package of Twinkies. He ripped it open and stuffed one in his mouth before he collapsed next to me, chewed and swallowed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done enough, Glory. Alesa doesn\u2019t need to be hanging out here.\u201d Rafe went for another Twinkie. \u201cThis is my problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it? You really believe a word that demon says?\u201d My heart ached for him. I laid my hand on his firm thigh. I felt the muscles tense as he made quick work of the other Twinkie.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019d never forgive myself if by some weird trick she did have my child and she took it down to hell with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the DNA test should take care of that.\u201d I sighed and leaned into my corner of the couch. Not telling Rafe my latest problem. He had enough on his plate already.</p><p>\u201cDNA? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Alesa\u2019s voice shattered the moment like a bullet hitting glass.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Alesa. Ian can\u2019t do a test until the baby\u2019s born. You\u2019ve got a few more months to pretend this baby\u2019s Rafe\u2019s. Enjoy your nap?\u201d I ignored her one-finger salute.</p> <p>\u201cNot really. There were about six air fresheners back there. What are you trying to hide?\u201d Alesa sat in a chair.</p><p>\u201cWe used to keep lab rats in Penny\u2019s room. Don\u2019t suppose you found any leftovers in the bed.\u201d I smiled. \u201cI have a cat too. Boogie\u2019s been under my bed since you came on the scene. Seems you can\u2019t even charm a kitty.\u201d</p><p>Alesa gave me a toothy grin. \u201cLike I\u2019d want to. I tossed the lavender shit out the window. Rats? No wonder I\u2019m hungry. Rafael, bring me a snack. And keep the cat out of my sight. Unless it\u2019s big enough to make a pair of slippers, if I see it, I\u2019m turning it into a toad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou harm my cat and I\u2019ll rip every hair from your oversized scaly-snout head.\u201d I ran to shut my bedroom door. I\u2019d already left Boogie\u2019s food and water in there when I realized how freaked-out he was.</p><p>\u201cOoo. I\u2019m terrified.\u201d Alesa laughed and shook her hands in the air. \u201cAnd my head is in perfect proportion, thank you. Cheap shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan the attitude, Alesa. I\u2019m through waiting on you.\u201d Rafe stayed put. \u201cGet your own damned snack. And you can pick up the tab at the hotel too.\u201d Rafe smiled at me and put his feet on my coffee table. When I gave him a look, he eased them back off but kept his smile. \u201cThis is your last visit to Glory too. Until we get positive DNA, I don\u2019t see any proof that I\u2019m the father here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory put you up to that rebellion?\u201d Alesa stood and stalked into the kitchen. We heard the refrigerator door slam, then cabinets open and close. Finally she came back into the living room with a block of cheddar cheese and a box of crackers. She also carried a knife. I didn\u2019t like seeing Alesa holding a knife.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame Glory for my attitude. I just got tired of being jerked around.\u201d Rafe stood and grabbed the knife and cheese from her. \u201cUse a paper plate and don\u2019t be a pig. You\u2019re not eating all the cheese.\u201d</p><p>I scooted over when Alesa took his seat on the couch. \u201cRafe\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have to do anything for you. Neither do I. All we\u2019ve got is your word that this baby has anything to do with either of us. And the word of a demon isn\u2019t worth spit. Your whole fa\u00e7ade is put on. So the baby bump could be part of your human fakery. Until Ian confirms that you\u2019re expecting and that Rafe is the father, you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. Suddenly I was staring at the fangs, scaly snout and claws of Alesa in all her demon glory. Her red eyes sent flames licking at my face, singing my eyebrows. Not again. It had taken me weeks to grow back my eyelashes after a previous demon encounter. Alesa did have a tummy bulge, not that it was obvious with all the other gross stuff going on. She growled and snagged my sweater with one claw.</p><p>\u201cOn my own? I don\u2019t think so. Did you forget how I can make your life here an outpost of hell? Want to play statues?\u201d She drew me up, claws clamped around my arms, until my toes wouldn\u2019t touch the ground. In her demon form she was over six feet tall.</p><p>\u201cNo. Down, girl. Want me to start singing church songs?\u201d Maybe I wasn\u2019t being humble enough, but I\u2019d had it with demon dirty tricks. I saw Rafe come out of the kitchen with a plate full of cheddar slices.</p><p>She winced. \u201cI can take it. And you can\u2019t sing if your mouth is sealed shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut her down, Alesa. You\u2019re melting the cheese.\u201d He sauntered over to the coffee table and put down the plate. \u201cDamn, I could have made myself some nachos while I was in there. We\u2019ve got tortilla chips. Glory, any jalape\u00f1os left?\u201d He had the nerve to wink at me.</p><p>\u201cQuit torturing me, Rafe. You\u2019ve got to know I\u2019ve never tasted a jalape\u00f1o in my life.\u201d I knew there was going to be more than one hole in my sweater, not to mention red marks on my arms. Rafe was obviously trying to keep things calm and to distract Alesa but, suspended in the air by my armpits, I was having a hard time playing along.</p><p>Alesa wasn\u2019t going to kill me. I knew that. It wouldn\u2019t gain her anything and would ruin her plans for the so-called baby. Who else could she go to if she let her temper get the best of her and took me out? She could, however, make the next few months around here miserable. We needed some rules and regs. So this was the time to lay them down. I sent Rafe a mental message to jump in on this.</p><p>\u201cAlesa, think this through. Mistreating the hostess isn\u2019t the way to get her to help you. And showing her your ugly mug? Dumb move. I say get human or get out.\u201d Rafe walked back to the kitchen and came out with a beer and a bag of tortilla chips. \u201cGlory\u2019s been pretty nice to you, arranging a doctor and all.\u201d He twisted off the beer cap and took a drink. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be losing your temper like that, Mama.\u201d</p><p>Alesa dropped me with a thump. \u201cIt\u2019s these hormones. Damn it, I would love some nachos. Jalape\u00f1os? Now you\u2019re talking.\u201d She got back into human form and sat down to scoop up the melted cheese with a cracker. \u201cWill you make me some, Rafael? I promise to behave.\u201d A dark, slimy tear trickled down her cheek. \u201cI know you can kick me to the curb, both of you. But where else can I go? I\u2019m desperate, don\u2019t you see? Hell was my home. Luc doesn\u2019t want me so I\u2019ve come to the only friends I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>I choked and Rafe took a gulp of his beer. We were her friends? How pathetic. I had no words. I glanced at Rafe and he shrugged then went back into the kitchen. To make nachos. He had a soft heart though he\u2019d never admit it. I examined my sweater for holes. Yep, it was ruined. My wardrobe wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand too many of these hormonal meltdowns.</p><p>\u201cAlesa, if this is how you treat your friends, I\u2019d sure as hell hate to see how you treat your enemies.\u201d I threw myself into a chair, as far away from her as I could get. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked up and gave me a smile full of fangs. \u201cTrust me, my enemies pray for death long before I\u2019m through with them. You want me to be grateful? Fine. Help me with this situation and I\u2019ll take out anyone you say. Your enemy is my enemy. How does that sound?\u201d</p><p>I shuddered and shook my head. A deal with a demon? It sounded like a fast ride down to her former playground. And one I wasn\u2019t having any part of.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t live here, end of story.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what if I like it here? Think about this, Glory. Your friends aren\u2019t my friends. If I want something, I will get it, one way or another. Even if it means stalking every one of your little friends and making their lives hell on earth until you see the light.\u201d Alesa laughed then slurped down more cheese. She threw me a look that made me wish for a shower and lots of soap.</p><p>Ian called and said the ultrasound hadn\u2019t come in yet. But the blood test showed that Alesa was definitely pregnant. Oh, joy. We rescheduled for Monday night. I decided to head down to the shop like I always did on a Saturday evening. I needed to be there\u2014we were usually busy\u2014and Rafe and I stayed firm that Alesa could fend for herself. Of course that left me wondering what she\u2019d do next. I didn\u2019t figure her for idle threats.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t given me a cell phone number or any way to reach her but I knew she\u2019d find me, unfortunately.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t been in the store ten minutes when my cell rang. My best friend Flo was trying to get a group together to go dancing at Rafe\u2019s club.</p><p>\u201cNot really in the mood, pal. Another night.\u201d I smiled at a customer who was carrying a skirt to the counter.</p> <p>\u201cBut, amica, you love to dance. What is this mood? Tell me.\u201d Flo didn\u2019t like taking no for an answer. \u201cYou close at midnight. Call Jeremiah and meet us then. Rafael will reserve a big table for us on the balcony.\u201d</p><p>I was tempted. I\u2019d love to cry on Flo\u2019s tiny shoulder. But doubted I\u2019d be able to escape from Alesa to do it and no way was I letting the demon within scenting distance of my best bud. Flo\u2019s husband, a former priest, would go ballistic if I got near his wife with another demon. She\u2019d had a close call with hell the last time I\u2019d involved her in one of my freakfests and I sure didn\u2019t want to remind Alesa who my friends were.</p><p>\u201cTell her yes. I love to dance.\u201d Alesa was suddenly in front of me. \u201cUnless we\u2019ll still be at Ian\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you back, Flo.\u201d I ended the call. \u201cNot going to Ian\u2019s tonight. That special machine didn\u2019t arrive.\u201d I grabbed Alesa\u2019s arm, but carefully. After all, she was pregnant. \u201cBack room. Now.\u201d I did a quick check. Erin could handle the sparse crowd.</p><p>\u201cSince you asked so nicely and all.\u201d Alesa jerked her arm out of my grasp and flounced toward the back room. As she did, an expensive sweater fell out of the back of her skirt. I scooped it up off the floor.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? Were you shoplifting? In my store?\u201d I barely suppressed the urge to throw the demon against the table before I started to shut the door to the shop. It took everything in me not to slam it.</p> <p>\u201cHold it, Glory. Is that demon with you?\u201d Diana Marchand, owner of Mugs and Muffins, the coffee shop next door, stuck her foot in the door.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I glanced at Alesa, who just smiled and studied her fingernails like she was looking for a chip in the black polish. \u201cWhat has she done now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe just left my shop without paying for the half dozen muffins she scarfed down.\u201d Diana pushed her way inside my back room and waited until I had us closed inside. Diana, a vampire and a friend, didn\u2019t hesitate to get in Alesa\u2019s face. \u201cI don\u2019t tolerate deadbeats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay her, Glory.\u201d Alesa brushed crumbs off her shirt front. \u201cGreat muffins, by the way. Though not very filling. I could have eaten a few more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay out of my store. I don\u2019t want a demon in there. You hear me?\u201d Diana turned to me. \u201cWhat the blazes are you doing hanging out with such as this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my choice, believe me.\u201d I started to argue about the bill with Alesa but didn\u2019t want to do it in front of Diana. \u201cTell Erin up front what you\u2019re owed and she\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d I glared at Alesa. \u201cThis won\u2019t happen again. I\u2019m doing my best to get rid of the problem.\u201d</p><p>Diana looked from me to Alesa and back again. \u201cHoney, I figure you must be over a barrel to tolerate this, um, critter.\u201d She patted my shoulder. \u201cLet me know if you need my help.\u201d She clasped the cross at her neck. \u201cThough what I could do...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the thought anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRun along, little vampire. We\u2019re just fine. And, seriously? Your coffee is weak and I\u2019ve had better service in hell.\u201d Alesa sniffed.</p><p>\u201cWell, glad you mentioned it. Coffee. I\u2019ll add that to your bill.\u201d Diana jerked open the door and looked at me one more time. \u201cI\u2019ll say some prayers for you, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I need all of those I can get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGag me.\u201d Alesa shot the finger at Diana\u2019s back before I shut the door again.</p><p>\u201cSee what happens when you cut me off without a penny? I\u2019m reduced to walking without paying the check, shoplifting when I need a nice cardigan to wear. The evenings are cold here.\u201d Alesa pretended to shiver. \u201cI\u2019m used to a much warmer climate, you know.\u201d</p><p>I counted to ten, twenty. \u201cWhy are you even here in the shop?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooking for you, obviously. We had an appointment. You weren\u2019t in the apartment so this is the second place I looked.\u201d Alesa smirked. \u201cYour clerk never noticed when I stuffed that sweater down my skirt. Hell, I could have taken half the blouse rack and she\u2019d have missed my smooth moves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErin\u2019s a good clerk. She was ringing up a sale. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t smell you the minute you hit the door.\u201d I\u2019d been talking on the phone. No wonder we were losing inventory.</p><p>\u201cThat chick\u2019s shop next door had just taken a batch of cookies out of the oven. Great disguise for me. Sneaked right up on you.\u201d Alesa wrinkled her nose. \u201cSo when are we going dancing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. You can\u2019t be around my friends. Not Flo and Richard. You remember what happened the last time you were around them?\u201d I rubbed my forehead. Headache. Too much stress. And between the reek of Alesa and those cookies next door, I really couldn\u2019t breathe. It was taking a toll.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. That Italian shoe freak married to that religious zealot managed to orchestrate the love-in that got me sent back to hell when I was stuck in your body.\u201d Alesa sighed. \u201cI wanted to go back, you know. Seriously. Your body wasn\u2019t exactly a demon\u2019s playground, even if there\u2019s plenty of room in the hip area.\u201d She gave me a look I recognized, the skinny girl superior smirk. I wanted to slap it off her face. Couldn\u2019t even breathe through the urge. I just shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou can only imagine the tears of joy shed that night when I finally felt you pop out of me.\u201d I gave her my own condescending once-over. \u201cGood triumphs over evil. There were trumpets in Heaven playing the \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 chorus.\u201d</p><p>Alesa shuddered. \u201cAs if anyone up there noticed your fat ass.\u201d She sniffed. \u201cLucifer was certainly glad to see me. At first anyway. Then he noticed I had this little bun in the oven and ordered me to get rid of it.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cNo way in hell or in any other dimension, baby. I told him that, right to his beautiful face. I\u2019d worked too hard to get knocked up.\u201d She let me see the tears glittering in her eyes. \u201cSo we had it out. Of course I lost that battle. Luc rules down there.\u201d Big watery sigh.</p><p>\u201cSo you can never go back?\u201d My heart fell to my feet. No way was I going to be stuck forever with this hellspawn and her offspring.</p><p>\u201cNot saying that.\u201d Alesa managed a smile. \u201cI have some leverage. A few secrets I can use to bring Luc around. But I have to have the baby first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019d raise him or her in hell? Is that even possible?\u201d I couldn\u2019t wrap my mind around the image of a nursery down below. I\u2019d heard stories of torture, sex and perversion there. Even a demon baby deserved love and a peaceful upbringing.</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s possible, Glory. I was raised in hell and look at how I turned out.\u201d Alesa ran her hand proudly down her body.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks, I value my eyesight.\u201d I sat on my only chair.</p><p>\u201cContrary to what you think, Glory, I was a favored demoness in the inner circle.\u201d Alesa tossed her long black hair over her shoulder and posed like she was ready for her close-up as \u201cDemon of the Year.\u201d Then she deflated. \u201cWhich is why Lucifer went so ballistic when he realized I\u2019d been unfaithful to him with another entity. He might have handled it if I\u2019d done the deed with another demon.\u201d Big sigh. \u201cBut he knew with one sniff that this baby wasn\u2019t going to be pure. Rafe has that shifter side, you know. Unacceptable in Luc\u2019s world. The Devil doesn\u2019t mind growing his flock but he\u2019s got these rules about it. You see Luc himself can\u2019t procreate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Alesa sniffed. \u201cWhatever. This is a minor setback. I\u2019ll win the big guy over again. Especially in about ten years when the little sprig here is fully grown.\u201d She touched her tummy. \u201cThen I\u2019ll take him back downstairs and Luc will see how truly awesome he is, even if he\u2019s not a pureblood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen years?\u201d I felt sick. A decade of Alesa? No way.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so freaked. Rafael and I won\u2019t have to stay here, you know. Must I remind you that you were just the vessel?\u201d Alesa picked up the cardigan she\u2019d appropriated, a nice green one, and slipped it on. \u201cWhat was I thinking? Green is way too festive. Black is my color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me that. You pay for anything you get here.\u201d I snatched the sweater and folded it with shaking hands. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Alesa. As soon as you admit this pregnancy has nothing to do with Rafe either, you\u2019re moving on. Stay away from my shop unless I bring you here.\u201d I dropped the sweater on a shelf. \u201cAnd no more shoplifting. From anywhere.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGive me a break. Rafe\u2019s cut off my money and Luc certainly didn\u2019t send me off with a credit card.\u201d Alesa\u2019s smile chilled me. \u201cOf course I could always knock over a liquor store, snatch a purse or two. It\u2019s easy when you can turn people to stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d My headache was turning into the vampire equivalent of a migraine. \u201cHere\u2019s a challenge. See if you can get your money honestly. You figure out how to do that and I\u2019ll take you dancing with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d Alesa spat the word. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me. Demons don\u2019t do honest.\u201d She looked down at herself. Tonight she had on a long black knit skirt and a black and silver top that said \u201cBaby on Board\u201d in rhinestones. She also wore black tights and black and silver demiboots. \u201cThough I do know fashion. You\u2019ve got customers out there who could use some help.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t work here.\u201d The very thought had me up and out of my chair. I put myself between Alesa and the door into the shop.</p><p>\u201cKidding. Demons don\u2019t work either unless it\u2019s to garner a soul for Lucifer.\u201d Alesa batted her ridiculously long dark lashes at me. \u201cCome over to the dark side, Glory, and we\u2019ll have a ball. A little petty crime is barely a blip on the sin scale and Mugs and Muffins seems to be raking in the cash. I could take out that vamp behind the counter while you empty the register. Then I\u2019d have money for a new hotel room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blip? Stealing is so much more than that. Even if the owner Diana and I weren\u2019t friends, I\u2019d never do that.\u201d I shuddered at the way her mind worked. \u201cAnd a new room? What\u2019s wrong with the old one?\u201d I thought Rafe had her settled in a hotel, one fairly cheap and far enough away to keep her out of my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. You\u2019ve challenged me. So I\u2019ll give it a try. Honesty. Maybe it\u2019ll be fun for a change.\u201d She smiled that creepy smile of hers.</p><p>\u201cYes, it might even grow on you.\u201d And it certainly would be a better role model for her baby. Unfortunately I really didn\u2019t think she could do anything honestly. But if she did somehow manage it, I\u2019d make sure we went dancing on a night when Flo wasn\u2019t going.</p> <p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t. Not putting me off. We\u2019ll go tonight. I can avoid your saintly friends. In fact, wouldn\u2019t be caught dead with them.\u201d For some reason that made her laugh. \u201cOr undead. Gee, Glory, where\u2019s your sense of humor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost it when a pregnant demon knocked on my door.\u201d I knew I was being backed into a corner.</p><p>\u201cWhat time?\u201d Alesa had a gleam in her eyes I didn\u2019t trust. She\u2019d been reading my mind of course.</p><p>\u201cYou expect to make money tonight?\u201d I wanted nothing more than to go upstairs and lie down with a cold cloth on my aching head.</p><p>\u201cOh, I guarantee it. And I won\u2019t rob or kill anyone to get it. Now what time, Glory?\u201d Alesa walked to the back door, the one that opened into the alley.</p><p>\u201cWe close at midnight on Saturdays. Meet me here then.\u201d I sighed. \u201cAnd no one gets hurt, Alesa.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. Got it.\u201d She smiled. \u201cSee you before midnight, cash in hand. Oh, this is going to be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, there\u2019s something going on across the street you need to see.\u201d Erin had just come in from her dinner break and slid behind the cash register where I was finishing a sale.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I handed the customer her bag then turned to my clerk.</p><p>\u201cGo see for yourself.\u201d Erin laughed. \u201cNo, not funny. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Somehow I knew this was Alesa\u2019s doing. I pushed open the door and looked toward the corner. There were several people standing in front of a woman who held a hand-lettered sign. No rhinestones now. Alesa, barefoot and dirty, wore a sad-looking and very faded knit maternity dress. Her sign said \u201cPregnant, Hungry and Homeless\u201d and a paper grocery sack sat on the ground in front of her. While I watched, a man dropped a few bills into the bag. I heard Alesa say, \u201cBless you.\u201d</p><p>Bless you? From a demon? I ran across the street.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not homeless!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am. They kicked me out of the hotel this afternoon. Something about a little fire and Rafael canceling his credit card.\u201d Alesa sniffed and wiped her eyes. Dark smudges, which humans watching would assume were mascara, made her look haggard. \u201cAnd of course you told me I couldn\u2019t stay in your apartment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you hassling her, lady?\u201d Another man dropped a twenty in her bag. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever fallen on hard times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And where\u2019s this baby\u2019s father, honey?\u201d A woman handed Alesa a pamphlet and a ten-dollar bill. \u201cThere\u2019s a shelter where you can sleep just a few blocks from here. Be sure to eat first. They lock the doors at ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBless you both. The father\u2019s denying everything. He\u2019s insisting on a DNA test. Can you believe it? And he knows I was true to him.\u201d Alesa sniffled. \u201cSome people are so kind. Some\u201d\u2014she shook her head at me\u2014\u201caren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Just then a police car pulled up to the curb.</p><p>\u201cMove along. No panhandling or I\u2019ll have to take you in.\u201d The policeman said through his open window.</p><p>Alesa waved her pamphlet at him. \u201cNo worries, Officer. I\u2019m on my way to the shelter.\u201d She picked up her bag, which I could see was full of cash, and started down the sidewalk.</p><p>I hurried to catch up with her. \u201c\u2018Bless you\u2019? I\u2019m surprised Lucifer didn\u2019t singe your tail for talking like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say the \u2018G\u2019 word.\u201d Alesa winced when she stepped on a stone. \u201cThis outfit did the job, but I can\u2019t stand looking poor and pitiful one more minute!\u201d She blinked and now stood clean and changed into black leather, maternity style. It was a hip look and I wished I had an outfit like that to sell in my shop. With the metal studs and thigh-high boots, she could have been a motorcycle gang\u2019s Madonna.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking? Doing magic in public and on the street?\u201d I frantically checked for shocked or bewildered bystanders. Luckily it was dark and we had the park on one side and an abandoned building across the street. The police car had disappeared around the corner.</p><p>\u201cRelax. For a vampire you are way too uptight. Anybody ever tell you that, Glory?\u201d Alesa stopped and looked me over. \u201cI read your thoughts. So Ian told you something about being a super freak. Never human. I know he\u2019s right. You\u2019re a weird combo. When I was inside you, I did a little poking around. You\u2019ve got powers you\u2019ve never even tried to tap, girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Okay, I\u2019d never trusted this demon but she did literally know me inside out. I had to ask.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d She dragged me into the deserted park. The only occupant was a man asleep on a bench. Someone really homeless. She poked him on his shoulder. \u201cGet up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Alesa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn experiment. Here\u2019s someone who needs a shelter and shower. And you say I reek, Glory?\u201d She dragged him off the bench.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell? This is my bench. Get yer own!\u201d He hit at her and lunged back toward his home sweet home. Alesa just laughed and danced away from his filthy hands.</p><p>\u201cPuh-lease. You can keep your precious bed.\u201d She reached into her bag which she\u2019d turned into a black leather tote. \u201cFive bucks if you walk to that tree and back.\u201d</p><p>The man stopped and licked his lips. \u201cWhat\u2019s yer game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo game. Easy money. Now walkee, walkee.\u201d Alesa fluttered the bill in front of his bloodshot eyes then gave him a shove.</p><p>\u201cDamned students and their stupid \u2019speriments.\u201d But he did start to stagger down the dirt path.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to, Alesa?\u201d I\u2019d stayed downwind of both of them. Not that I was breathing, but I didn\u2019t want the stench clinging to my hair or clothes.</p><p>\u201cGiving you a chance to strut your stuff, vamp girl.\u201d Alesa gave me a toothy grin. \u201cNow concentrate. Stare at this stink weed and turn him to stone.\u201d Alesa waved at him.</p><p>\u201cAre you nuts? I\u2019m not a demon.\u201d I gaped at her. \u201cI could never...\u201d Turn someone to stone? If only I could. It was an awesome power. The best defense possible. I did stare at the man. Easy target, barely moving, obviously under the influence of something. Was it possible...?</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say you were a demon. Know you aren\u2019t. You should be so lucky. But while I was stuck in you, I did a Glory gut check.\u201d Alesa shuddered. \u201cAnd I thought hell could be a pit. Amidst all your gooey goodness I found some interesting tidbits, hints of some stuff just lying around, waiting to be used.\u201d Alesa\u2019s fangs appeared. \u201cHow dumb can you get? Honey, you want your guys to respect you, you need to pull up a little of your inner badass from time to time.\u201d She nodded toward the man who\u2019d decided he\u2019d done five bucks\u2019 worth and was headed back to his bench. \u201cThis statue thing is a perfect way to show you can kick butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe... Surely if I could...\u201d I shook my head. Alesa just stared at me, daring me to give it a go. What did I have to lose? This was probably a trick. Alesa would watch me try it then laugh her ass off. But I whirled around, glared at the poor man who\u2019d made it halfway home and thought, \u201cFreeze!\u201d</p><p>He stalled in mid stumble. I held my breath, then ran up to him.</p><p>\u201cHello? Can you hear me?\u201d He still didn\u2019t move. I poked him in his filthy jacket sleeve but he lost position abruptly and staggered a few steps, collapsing against me.</p><p>\u201cEww, yuck.\u201d I pushed him away. \u201cWell, that was an epic fail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. More like a five-second freeze. You lost focus. Try again.\u201d Alesa stood behind me, her hands on my shoulders. \u201cKeep your mind on your business. Don\u2019t get distracted by his stench.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Less yer buyin\u2019 me some booze or passin\u2019 me the moolah, take yer \u2019speriments somewheres else.\u201d The man patted his pockets. \u201cIf someone hadn\u2019t stole my knife, I\u2019d show ya what happens when ya mess with Jimmy Flint.\u201d He coughed and sputtered, obviously about to spit right at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFreeze!\u201d I yelled out loud this time, staring at him hard. His mouth froze before he could cut loose. \u201cFreeze, freeze, freeze,\u201d I thought furiously as I stepped closer and moved my hand in front of his eyes. He never blinked.</p><p>\u201cI did it!\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe it. Had I really had this power all these years? Even Jerry couldn\u2019t freeze people. And this guy was solid. I poked him gingerly. Yep, as solid as I\u2019d been the times people, most of them higher on the paranormal pecking order than I\u2019d ever hoped to be, had turned me into a statue. This was freaking amazing.</p><p>\u201cYep. You\u2019ve got the power. Now step out of range. He\u2019s going to spit when you thaw him, no doubt about it. Let me go ahead and take him out and hell can have him. According to my demonic rolodex, Jimmy Flint was one bad dude before he pickled his think tank.\u201d Alesa rubbed her hands together, obviously more than happy to put this man down like a rabid dog or something. \u201cSending him below to his just reward could win me some points with Luc.\u201d</p> <p>The idea made me sick to my stomach. Or was that the stink in the air? Bad dude or not, I wasn\u2019t allowing murder and Alesa knew it. She made a face and stepped back, muttering about \u201cgooey goodness\u201d again.</p><p>\u201cI think living on a bench in his condition is a pretty good punishment for the here and now. And you know I\u2019m not going to let you take out anyone. Not if you want my help with that pregnancy.\u201d I had to say it, just to make things crystal clear.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. Why do I even bother?\u201d Alesa leaned against a tree. \u201cYou want to know how to thaw him out, agree to take me dancing with you tonight. No last-minute excuses.\u201d</p><p>Blackmail. Of course it was in the demon repertoire. And I had been trying to figure out how to stall her until another night. \u201cYou said all I have to do is lose focus.\u201d I turned my back on the guy. \u201cThat should do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when he\u2019s in full statue mode, vamp girl.\u201d Alesa smiled. \u201cLook at him. Before, he wasn\u2019t concrete yet. Now it takes a special technique to thaw him. You want it? Let\u2019s make a deal.\u201d She put her hands on her hips and hummed a popular dance tune.</p> <p>I checked back to be sure. Too bad but she was right. My \u201c\u2019speriment\u201d was still solid. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll take you to the club. I\u2019m sure you can find some poor sap to dance with you.\u201d Yes, I had an attitude, but being saddled with a demon again, new power or not, was working on my last nerve. \u201cYou look like a pregnant dominatrix. I bet that works as some perv\u2019s fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Glory, you do say the sweetest things.\u201d Alesa actually did look pleased and even added chains to her boots and a spike through one eyebrow.</p><p>I turned to the project at hand. I had a statue, his nasty three layers of coats blowing in the chilly breeze. How was this possible? I couldn\u2019t resist. I raised the man\u2019s arm, testing to see if it fell. It didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAny idea what I could be? Why I can do this?\u201d I didn\u2019t look at Alesa, still fascinated by what I\u2019d done. Raise his foot, it stayed. In control, he would have fallen over.</p><p>\u201cDamned if I know. Come on, quit playing with him. Just stare into his eyes and think \u2018Thaw.\u2019\u201d Alesa stomped over and poked my back. \u201cHurry. I should\u2019ve used more of your hairspray. This night air\u2019s doing a number on my hair, making it go flat. In Texas, I think I should have big hair. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t argue with that. Loved big hair myself. Playing with him. That finally got through to me and I thawed him before we got out of there quickly. I did make sure Alesa dropped the five dollars she owed him in his lap.</p> <p>\u201cWaste of money. You erased his memory,\u201d Alesa whined as we headed to the shop.</p><p>\u201cAre you honest about anything? Never mind.\u201d Of course she wasn\u2019t. But she had been right about this power that could turn people to stone. \u201cSeriously, any idea what I could be, Alesa? If I\u2019m not a demon?\u201d This really worried me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve known lots of creatures with the freeze trick, even some ancient vamps. No telling what other untapped powers you\u2019ve got.\u201d Alesa glanced at her wrist and was suddenly sporting a Cartier tank watch. \u201cEleven o\u2019clock. Is that what you\u2019re wearing?\u201d She grinned. \u201cHey, I just had a thought. Pawn shops. I can pawn stuff like this.\u201d She held up her wrist. \u201cAnd I can create an endless supply. It\u2019s a demon thing. We have a treasure trove. Stuff we\u2019ve stripped off the losers who end up down there when their tickets are finally punched. You know how they say you can\u2019t take it with you? You wouldn\u2019t believe how many people think they can.\u201d She laughed merrily, but, trust me, a demon\u2019s merry laugh will make your hair stand on end. Big hair, but think Frankenstein\u2019s girlfriend.</p><p>Finally she gasped and wiped her eyes again. \u201cProblem solved. As long as Luc doesn\u2019t cut me off, I\u2019m good to go for funds here.\u201d She sighed. \u201cBest head to your place and fix my makeup. I left my luggage there.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to scream. \u201cMade yourself right at home, didn\u2019t you? I don\u2019t recall giving you a key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemons don\u2019t need keys. Or invites. We do as we please. And I want us to be pals.\u201d Alesa gave me her best smile, full fanged. I\u2019m sure in hell it played well. Me? I wanted to puke. \u201cThis was a good time, Glory. Playing statues with you. I think there are more powers I could teach you. We\u2019ll be like sisters, you and me. Money or not, I\u2019m moving in. I don\u2019t mind sleeping on your couch. Compared to the rack I\u2019ve got downstairs with Luc, it\u2019s pretty cozy.\u201d She slipped her arm through mine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost your mind.\u201d I was still freaked by the fact that I could, yes, turn people into stone. She thought I had more untapped powers? What could they be? I was desperate to know. But not so desperate that I was willing to act like her sister.</p><p>\u201cTry to keep me out. Need proof I can do what I want? Just wait.\u201d Alesa clung to me and I couldn\u2019t get away from her. Demonic power pushed us back to the shop where Erin assured me she could close by herself. Then we headed upstairs.</p> <p>\u201cStop this, Alesa. Let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Just call your little friends and get this evening going.\u201d Alesa plopped on the couch, listening in while I did call Flo, then Jerry. Somehow I would enjoy being with my friends and keep them away from Alesa. I knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy. But I couldn\u2019t wait to tell everyone about my new power, maybe even show it off.</p><p>Wait a minute. That was demon thinking. A power like that was better reserved for an emergency. Hopefully, I\u2019d never even need it. Yeah, right. With my life?</p><p>Six</p><p>N-V was packed, the usual situation on a Saturday night. Trey, Penny\u2019s boyfriend, let us in and directed Alesa and me toward the balcony where Flo and her party waited.</p><p>\u201cAlesa, you know I\u2019m not taking you up there.\u201d I smoothed down my black dress which was short to show off my legs and cut low to show off my cleavage. I know how to make the most of what I\u2019ve got. Alesa still had on her black leather and got some admiring looks despite being obviously pregnant.</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019d want to hang with your friends. The action\u2019s down here anyway.\u201d She smiled at Trey. \u201cCan you set me up at the bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Trey didn\u2019t smile. He knew exactly what Alesa was by smell. He was a shifter and he gave me a look, like what was Penny\u2019s roommate doing running around with a demon? \u201cJack, the bartender, will take care of you. Enjoy the band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could dance with me on your break.\u201d Alesa made it sound like a command as she snagged a sharp fingernail on his black N-V T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe not.\u201d Trey nodded toward the door. \u201cMy girl will be here any minute. She gets my dances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Penny is at the football game with her parents.\u201d I tugged Alesa away from Trey. \u201cHands off this guy, Alesa. Trey, tell her where I am, but, if her parents are with her\u201d\u2014I made a face\u2014\u201cgood luck with that.\u201d Penny\u2019s mortal folks had no idea their daughter had been turned vampire the previous spring. We\u2019d been doing a lot of lying and juggling ever since. Nothing new there. It\u2019s called blending. We were surrounded by mortals now and I\u2019d downed a bottle of synthetic at the apartment before we\u2019d come so I could keep my fangs under control surrounded by all the warm, rich blood I could smell everywhere. It was working so far, but I was ordering more synthetic as soon as I got to the bar.</p><p>\u201cHaving a little thirst issue, Glory? Come with me to the bar and we\u2019ll get you that drink. They have the stuff with alcohol for you fangers?\u201d Alesa had her arm hooked through mine again. It was driving me crazy that she thought she could actually act like my friend.</p><p>\u201cHush. Remember where you are, Alesa.\u201d I glanced at the mortals around us. \u201cAnd of course they have stuff that I like. It\u2019s Rafe\u2019s club. He caters to us.\u201d I jerked away from the demon, risking the kind of scene she\u2019d relish. I felt eyes on me and looked up at the balcony. Yes, Jerry was up there and he\u2019d already headed for the stairs. I sensed another presence and turned. Rafe was working his way around the edge of the large room toward us. He gave me a nod, frowning when he noticed Alesa\u2019s hold on me. Thank God for friendly faces.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here? And still bugging Glory? I told you to leave her alone.\u201d Rafe dragged Alesa away from me.</p><p>\u201cLike I listen to you.\u201d She waved at the vampire bartender and ordered a shot of tequila.</p><p>\u201cNot happening. No alcohol with a baby on board.\u201d I signaled the bartender for my usual blood with alcohol.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t hurt my kind.\u201d Alesa smirked. \u201cTake the stick out of your butt, Glo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou claim what you carry is part shifter.\u201d Rafe\u2019s hand came down on the bar. \u201cPlay by the rules while you\u2019re here. We don\u2019t serve alcohol to pregnant women.\u201d He gave his bartender a look. \u201cGive her a bottled water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re no fun. For that, you have to dance with me.\u201d Alesa put on a pouty face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot in this lifetime.\u201d Rafe turned his back on her. \u201cGlory, Blade and I want to talk to you. Come to my office.\u201d</p><p>Jerry was right behind him. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve got something for you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is this, an intervention?\u201d I was familiar with those, but not for myself. Well, not recently anyway. In Las Vegas, I\u2019d needed one for my gambling problem. Back then Rafe had been in dog form as my bodyguard. He and a few vamp girlfriends had done the deed making me cut up my credit cards and sending me to a program when I\u2019d lost control at the poker tables. I\u2019d be forever grateful.</p> <p>\u201cDo you need an intervention? Why are you still running around with that creature?\u201d Jerry glanced from me to Alesa, who smirked like she knew a secret. \u201cAnd what have you two been up to? Gambling?\u201d He leaned close to whisper in my ear. \u201cRipping out throats in dark alleys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerry! No and hell no!\u201d I put my hand on his chest then glanced at Rafe. Both of them looked so good to me. Safe havens. I was grateful for their strength, not to mention loyalty. And then there was the obvious... If I ever needed another twelve-step program it would probably be for a sexual addiction. These men were just about irresistible, each in his own way. Jerry had that rugged, battle-worn look that always made me want to soothe his hurts while he soothed mine. Then there was Rafe, who was 100 percent Latin lover.</p><p>I indulged in a little fantasy about what could happen in Rafe\u2019s office if these men really had reached some kind of truce. Oh, yeah. And I\u2019d be in the middle. My cheeks felt warm, my thoughts well blocked, as we eased through the crowd to the door behind the stage.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s attached herself to me like a leech. Threatening my friends. I don\u2019t know how to get rid of her. Any suggestions?\u201d I saw the men exchange glances, for once in accord about something but silent until we got past the stage. The famous band on tap for the night had questions for Rafe about the venue. Then one of the guys recognized me from a party I\u2019d attended with Ray. It would have been rude to just brush him off so I gave the man a Ray update. I was glad I could say Israel Caine was on the wagon and writing music again.</p><p>Finally Jerry just grabbed my hand, pulled me into Rafe\u2019s office, and slammed the door once Rafe slipped in behind me. The soundproofing there was impressive and we soaked in the sudden silence. It took me a minute to realize we weren\u2019t alone.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s our suggestion, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry gestured at the woman who sat on the corner of Rafe\u2019s desk. Gorgeous. And a lot of her. When she stood, she hit over six feet in her platform tennis shoes. She had glorious golden red hair streaked with black and the iciest blue eyes I\u2019d ever seen. Right now they examined me until I squirmed and wanted to check to see if a black bra strap was showing. Instead, I took a breath. Shifter.</p><p>\u201cHello. Are you here to get Alesa off my back?\u201d I smiled. \u201cI\u2019d be forever grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding.\u201d She didn\u2019t smile back. Hmm. \u201cDemons are after only one thing, Glory St. Clair. No matter what they tell you they want. You dumb enough to give one of them your soul?\u201d</p><p>That wiped the smile off my face. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEase up, Laurie.\u201d Rafe put his hand on my shoulder. Jerry had already laid his hand on my other one.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got to get this straight right now. I can\u2019t protect her if she\u2019s running around with a demon sidekick like they\u2019re friends or something.\u201d Laurie, since apparently that was her name, crossed her arms over her chest. It wasn\u2019t a big bosom, but decent. The kind I\u2019d like to have. So I could wear a blouse that buttoned up the front and I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it gapping open. You know what I mean?</p> <p>\u201cWho the hell is this? It\u2019s not like I have a choice, guys. Of course I don\u2019t want to be near Alesa. But what can I do? She\u2019s been making threats. How is this person supposed to protect me from a demon?\u201d I knew what this was now. They\u2019d hired another bodyguard for me. Hah! And Jerry wasn\u2019t taking chances this time. A female bodyguard. He and Rafe had actually agreed to work together. I liked that, but not that they\u2019d sneaked around and arranged this without consulting me.</p><p>\u201cLaurie Mehta. She\u2019s a were-cat. Shifts into a Bengal tiger.\u201d Rafe grinned. \u201cYou should see it, Glory. Absolutely awesome. Nothing bigger on the cat grid. She can take out whatever comes after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven a demon? Isn\u2019t that why you\u2019re hiring her?\u201d I tapped my foot. \u201cWhat can a were-cat do against a demon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than you think.\u201d Laurie aimed those glacial eyes at me and I had to steel myself not to squirm. She had some real intensity going there. \u201cI\u2019ve trained with some of the best spiritualists in the business. Believe it or not I can shut your demoness down when she tries some of her crap.\u201d She smiled and polished her pale pink nails on her brown T-shirt. She wore a no-nonsense outfit of that plain T-shirt with drawstring khakis. I hated to tell her but, if she was going to run around with me, she was going to have to upgrade her look.</p><p>\u201cSounds like bragging to me. I\u2019ve never seen anyone have any effect on Alesa except for an ex-priest. And even he couldn\u2019t do it alone.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cCome on, guys. Why are you wasting your money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, it\u2019s not a waste. You\u2019re determined to have business with MacDonald, Gloriana, and Laurie can be present for every minute of your visits with him.\u201d Jerry smiled his approval of the were-cat. \u201cSecond, if she can control Alesa, then I will definitely feel better about your being around her. I stopped by your shop earlier and Erin said you\u2019d disappeared with the demon. I sure as hell couldn\u2019t find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll tell you about that later. Something really cool happened.\u201d I heard the excitement in my voice. Uh-oh. Cool and Alesa together? Was I being pulled over to the dark side? No, it was the power I was excited about. Alesa had just called it to my attention.</p><p>I saw Laurie whispering with Rafe. They would make a nice couple. If nothing else I should encourage that. Let Rafe go and he could move on to someone he could be happy with. He smiled at something she said. Yes, a were-cat would be a good mate for him. I wanted to slap myself in the head. Mate? When Alesa was supposedly carrying his child?</p> <p>\u201cGlory?\u201d Rafe stood in front of me. \u201cYou can\u2019t be alone with Alesa all the time. She\u2019s dangerous. We both know that.\u201d He looked over his shoulder to where Jerry was giving me a \u201cDo this, Gloriana\u201d stare.</p><p>\u201cYes, though the apartment is getting pretty crowded.\u201d I took Rafe\u2019s hand. \u201cI know you mean well and I am freakedout by having Alesa around. She\u2019s been kicked out of the hotel. Apparently she started a fire there today. Probably on purpose. So I\u2019m going to let her sleep on the couch. Where will Laurie sack out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m used to the bodyguard gig. Won\u2019t be the first time I\u2019ve bedded down on the floor.\u201d Laurie nodded at Jerry. \u201cNow the demon\u2019s living with her. Seems I hired on just in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. Gloriana, why are you allowing that?\u201d Jerry put his arm around me.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I had a choice. For some reason Alesa is determined to stay with me. She can hurt my friends, hurt me. Shit, she\u2019s literally hell on wheels. And we need to keep an eye on her until we know if she\u2019s carrying Rafe\u2019s child.\u201d I looked at Laurie. \u201cSeriously? You think you can handle her? And squeeze into an overcrowded apartment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I\u2019m paid to do. And as long as you have plenty of meat and a bathtub, I\u2019ll be fine. I do like my soaks. Which I can do during the day while you sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah. I can manage that.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to picture a Bengal tiger tearing into sides of beef then soaking in a tub to get the blood off. Weird. But then my life was one long episode of \u201cWeird Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the meat deliveries all arranged, Gloriana. They\u2019ll happen during your death sleep. Won\u2019t disturb you at all.\u201d Jerry dragged me toward the door. \u201cNow let\u2019s go upstairs and explain to our friends why you came into the club with a demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Jer, did they all smell Alesa?\u201d I dreaded the scene.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Richard was on his feet with a crucifix as soon as you hit the door.\u201d Jerry sighed. \u201cComing, Laurie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the clock right now, Jerry.\u201d Laurie smiled. \u201cRelax, Glory. I\u2019ve got your back. This demon will no longer be a problem. Guaranteed.\u201d</p><p>I smiled back. Guaranteed? Either Laurie had serious skills or she was terrifyingly overconfident. Either way, Alesa versus the tiger? I wanted a front-row seat for that party.</p><p>\u201cGlory, Aggie called me tonight. About shoe shopping. You promised her we\u2019d go together?\u201d Flo made a little face. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you warn me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Too much on my mind.\u201d I looked over the railing and saw Alesa dancing with a man who had also embraced the black leather philosophy. She threw back her head and laughed as they shook their butts to the beat. The band was kicking it into high gear and the floor was packed. I felt ancient, sitting up there watching. But the mood for dancing like a wild thing had left me as soon as I\u2019d seen Richard\u2019s frowning disapproval.</p><p>\u201cI can see that you\u2019re upset.\u201d Flo put her hand on mine. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, mia amica. We will go shopping with the Siren. Whatever you want. I hate this demon thing. And don\u2019t mind Ricardo. He is worried about me. But I promised him not to get near the she-devil. You won\u2019t bring her to the mall, will you?\u201d Flo clutched my hand. \u201cSwear it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, Flo. I won\u2019t. Cross my heart.\u201d I knew Flo was scared of what would happen if Alesa tried to persuade her to sell her soul to Lucifer. Flo had almost caved once. Because she wanted to see her own reflection. It drove her nuts that I could see mine and she couldn\u2019t see hers. She\u2019d gotten a glimpse of her reflection when a pair of demons had made a run at her soul. Then they\u2019d snatched the mirror trick away. Only Flo\u2019s absolute devotion to her very devout husband had helped her resist hell\u2019s diabolical promises. Hey, she figured she was going to live forever anyway. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am so, um, weak when it comes to resisting what I want. You know?\u201d Flo glanced at Richard, who was talking to Jerry and Damian on the other side of the table.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re strong. But I wouldn\u2019t want either of us put to the test again.\u201d I squeezed her hand. \u201cThanks for helping me with Aggie. I needed for her to give Ian a blood sample. For some tests he\u2019s running. So I had to bribe her with shoe shopping. She still wants to be pals with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who wouldn\u2019t want to be our friends, I ask?\u201d Flo grinned. \u201cBut what\u2019s this about blood samples? For Ian MacDonald? Does Jeremiah know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s one reason I have a new bodyguard. Because I\u2019m going to be seeing Ian not only for Alesa but for myself. To figure out why I always have those weird reactions to Ian\u2019s drugs.\u201d I pulled Flo\u2019s hand to my stomach. \u201cFeel. I have a lumpy stomach now, Flo. Because I took a new drug and had a strange reaction to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you take it? Will you never learn?\u201d Flo poked my tummy. \u201cThis is strange. You never had this before. I remember how you looked\u2014not thin, more like a Rubens painting, round and pretty and very smooth. What was the drug for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a wonder drug. Penny took it too. It let us eat real food.\u201d I sighed. \u201cYou see why I had to try it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and your craving for such things. Cheetos! Chocolate!\u201d Flo shook her head. \u201cMe? I never wish for Nonna\u2019s pasta. Though it could make you weep, I tell you. Delizio!\u201d She kissed her fingertips in typical Italian fashion. \u201cIt was too long ago, I have moved on.\u201d She grabbed my arm. \u201cBut, Glory, you know you always have bad things happen to you with Ian\u2019s drugs!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m stupid.\u201d I was getting irritated, more with myself than with Flo. \u201cI get that. But these blood tests helped Ian find out something important.\u201d My eyes suddenly filled with tears.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Amica, what is this?\u201d Flo gestured for Richard. \u201cRicardo, come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I shouldn\u2019t...\u201d Then I was sobbing on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLife of the party, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Laurie stood behind Flo.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Jerry sat in the chair beside me.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t quit crying while Flo patted my back and murmured soothing Italian words in my ear. Finally I seemed to run dry and sat up.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d I sniffed and looked around for a tissue.</p> <p>Laurie patted her pockets. \u201cGuess this gig\u2019s going to have different requirements from guarding a blood importer for the Transylvanian mob. He never cried. At least not until I told him I was leaving.\u201d She sighed when she came up empty.</p><p>\u201cYeah, start carrying tissues, an extra lipstick in my favorite color and sunglasses, in case I have swollen eyes from all the weeping and wailing I\u2019m going to do.\u201d I gratefully took the tissue Flo dug out of her designer clutch. \u201cAnd if that mobster had the issues I\u2019ve had lately, I bet he would have had a meltdown too.\u201d I mopped at my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI get a bonus for these crying jags, Jerry?\u201d Laurie raised her eyebrows at him. He was right beside me now, as usual speechless when I fall apart.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t promise her that, Jer, you\u2019d go broke.\u201d I dredged up a smile and looked around the table. \u201cSorry, guys. Guess I needed to unload and Flo has the best shoulder for that.\u201d I glanced at Jerry. \u201cI know. Yours is great, but you always want to fix things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could fix if I knew what in the hell you are crying about, mia amica.\u201d Flo handed me another tissue. \u201cWe can go to the ladies room. Do something about your makeup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo crowded. Employee break room. Rafe won\u2019t mind.\u201d I stood. \u201cGuess Laurie comes with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me. Yes, I do.\u201d She was right on our heels.</p><p>I heard Jerry whispering excuses to Damian and Richard. I stopped and turned around. \u201cTell them my problem. Maybe they can help me figure this thing out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Jerry was on his feet and by my side in an instant.</p><p>\u201cIf it won\u2019t get me kicked out of town by the council. First make Damian promise this won\u2019t go to them.\u201d I sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s all I need, a town eviction notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother will not dare.\u201d Flo clearly shot Damian a hot mental message and he jumped to his feet. They exchanged glares and a few hissed words in Italian, not bothering to use mental messages. Finally they both gestured and Damian sat again.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Gloriana. I am your friend first of all, council member second, as my sister reminds me.\u201d He gave me a charming smile, obviously able to turn his mood around on a dime.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Damian.\u201d My voice cracked and I felt the urge to sob again.</p><p>\u201cSee? It\u2019s settled. Now let\u2019s go.\u201d Flo pulled me toward the stairs.</p><p>With the band playing, the employee break room was empty as I knew it would be. I used the mirror and supplies from my purse to erase all signs of my crying jag. Enough waterworks. Not even when I told Flo the whole story. And I was going to have to. She paced the room while she waited for me to finish with lipstick and mascara. Her frowning glances at me in front of the mirror made me realize I was torturing her with this so I hurried.</p><p>\u201cSorry, pal. Now about the blood samples. Ian discovered from the first one he took that when Jerry turned me vampire I wasn\u2019t...\u201d I sucked in a breath. Not crying. No, no, no. \u201cHuman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Laurie said this first. She actually stepped close to me, picked up my hand and sniffed my skin. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. Vampire, that\u2019s all I\u2019m reading. And the various cosmetics, hairspray and that demon you\u2019ve been consorting with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot human?\u201d Flo\u2019s eyes were wide. \u201cRidicolo! You know what you were before. You told me about your life in London. Your first husband. How you met Jeremiah. Is this some trick to hurt your lover? Part of the feud between these Scots? In Italia there were forever these vendettas. Pah! Why can\u2019t these men let them go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo vendetta, Flo. I wish it was just a trick to hurt Jerry. He still believes that\u2019s Ian\u2019s agenda.\u201d I sat on the couch and patted the seat beside me. \u201cBut Ian\u2019s convinced me it\u2019s true. He\u2019s been comparing my blood sample to other paranormals, trying to figure out what else I could have been. When he heard I knew a Siren, he wanted Aggie\u2019s blood sample, for comparison to mine. She\u2019s scared of needles so the only way to get her to cooperate was to promise the shoe-shopping trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never thought I would say it, but I can\u2019t think of shoes with you in such a fix!\u201d Flo collapsed against the sofa cushions. \u201cThis is insensato! Here.\u201d She grabbed my arm and pulled it to her nose as Laurie had done. She inhaled. \u201cLa tigre is right. Nothing but vampire. Good, clean vampire with a hint of that lavender bodywash you like. If you had something else in you, wouldn\u2019t you reek of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Maybe Ian was messing with me. That stupid feud behind it. Until something else happened tonight, Flo.\u201d I glanced at Laurie. \u201cSomething that convinced me this might be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Is the demon filling your head with stories? She crouched inside you like a creepy disease for a while. Maybe she infected you and that\u2019s what Ian found. What is going on?\u201d Flo leaned forward and took my hands. \u201cTell us, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure I\u2019d believe anything a creature from hell spews.\u201d Laurie walked over and turned the lock on the door then plopped down in a chair across from us. \u201cBut if she managed to prove something to you, spill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe showed me that I can turn people to stone!\u201d I winced when Flo\u2019s grip tightened and she gasped. Clearly she was impressed. Laurie? I would have to make the earth spin backward to impress her.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? Let\u2019s see it.\u201d Laurie jumped up, opened the door and dragged a girl in from the hall. She locked the door again, did her tiger magic on the puzzled girl which got her to smile, suddenly happy to see us.</p><p>\u201cHi, y\u2019all. Laurie here said you wanted to see me? Buy me a drink? I\u2019m Amber.\u201d The blue-eyed blonde blinked. She\u2019d obviously already enjoyed a few drinks at the bar.</p><p>Since Laurie had never spoken out loud to her, I had new respect for my tiger\u2019s powers. \u201cSure, Amber, I\u2019ll buy you a drink.\u201d I got up to face her, looked in her eyes, concentrated and did my freeze thing.</p><p>\u201cGlory! Look at her. You did it! She can\u2019t move.\u201d Flo jumped to her feet, prodding the girl with a bronze-tipped nail. \u201cThis is fantastico.\u201d She raised the girl\u2019s arm and it stayed. Waved her hand in front of her eyes and Amber never blinked. \u201cCan you teach me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she can\u2019t. This is a power, Florence. Glory\u2019s got it. You can\u2019t buy it or learn it.\u201d Laurie nodded approvingly. \u201cWill make my job easier. Good going, Glo. Guess I can put up with your girly crying thing if you can kick butt like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks. Now I just have to thaw her. Can you get her out of here, Laurie?\u201d I dug a ten-dollar bill out of my purse. \u201cGive her this for that drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s had enough. I\u2019m going to suggest she switch to bottled water. That man she\u2019s with thinks he\u2019s got a sure thing. This woman needs to learn some self-respect.\u201d Laurie waited for me to thaw Amber then did some mental messaging that got Amber out the door and on her way with no memory of us.</p><p>\u201cGlory, you must be something else,\u201d Flo said quietly. \u201cSomething... Well, I never thought...\u201d She studied me like she\u2019d never seen me before. \u201cCould you be demon now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlo, honey, I\u2019m the same as I was five minutes ago!\u201d I touched her shoulder. To my horror, she flinched. \u201cSeriously. No matter what I used to be, I\u2019m all vampire now. You said so yourself. No taint of that hellish sweetness. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, what am I thinking?\u201d Flo stood and brushed down her skirt. As usual, she looked great in a red leather miniskirt and red and black sweater that hugged her figure. \u201cI\u2019m just sorry that Ricardo and I are going to Paris at the end of the week. We won\u2019t be here to support you with this demon problem. Or this other... thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLeaving? This is the first I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d And I bet it would be the first Richard heard of it too. Flo was getting out of town because of me. I wanted to bawl again. My best friend was afraid of me. No, surely not. She just needed time to process this. And I was sure Richard would be glad for them to leave because of Alesa anyway.</p><p>\u201cAbout the mall. Monday night?\u201d She smiled, obviously determined to act like nothing had happened.</p><p>\u201cNo can do. That\u2019s when I take Alesa to see Ian. He\u2019s going to be her doctor. Tuesday?\u201d I wanted to nail this down.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure Alesa won\u2019t try to trail along?\u201d Flo wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes, straightening the silver and gold bangles on her wrist.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let her, Florence.\u201d Laurie walked to the door, opened it and checked the hallway. \u201cYou can rest easy on that score.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then. Tuesday night. We\u2019ll shoe shop with Aggie.\u201d Flo linked arms with me. \u201cToo bad you can\u2019t come to Paris with me, Glory. Now there\u2019s some shoe shopping.\u201d She chattered about European shopping as we headed upstairs. I had no doubt she\u2019d tell Richard what had just happened in the break room. Which meant I\u2019d have to tell Jerry. What would he think? Only one way to find out.</p><p>\u201cGlory, my parents are downstairs. Can you bring Mr. Blade down so they can meet him?\u201d Penny had found us at our table a few minutes after Flo and I had rejoined the men.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Just what I needed, faking my way through a meeting with Penny\u2019s mortal parents. I didn\u2019t have a problem introducing Jerry to them, of course. In his business world he worked with mortals every night and had easily convinced them he was absolutely like them.</p> <p>Jerry and I followed Penny to a table away from the dance floor. Her parents were talking to Trey. It wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d met me or Penny\u2019s boyfriend. We got along fine because I\u2019d set Penny up in a clean apartment. You should have seen the mess she\u2019d lived in before. I knew they liked Trey too. He was gainfully employed and actually attended classes at the nearby university during the day. He also clearly adored their brilliant daughter.</p><p>\u201cGlory! Good to see you. This must be your young man.\u201d Penny\u2019s mother rushed up to me and gave me a hug.</p><p>\u201cYes, this is Jeremy Blade. Jerry, Mr. and Mrs. Patterson.\u201d My \u201cyoung\u201d man happened to be over five hundred years old but looked thirty. I just tuned out the introductions as I scanned the room for Alesa. I did not want her anywhere near this. \u201cAnd this is my friend Laurie Mehta. Penny, Laurie\u2019s going to be staying on our couch for a while. Just lost her lease.\u201d I smiled at Penny\u2019s expression and sent her a oneword mental message: \u201cBodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. Hey, Laurie. Nice to meet you.\u201d Penny introduced her to Trey and her parents then turned. Her twin sister, the cheerleader, and her date walked up, flushed and laughing, from the dance floor. \u201cMy twin, Jenny and her date, Darren.\u201d They exchanged nods with Laurie. Darren was a little awestruck at Laurie\u2019s unusual height and look and it took an elbow from Jenny to get his attention back on his date.</p><p>\u201cHow was the game, Jenny?\u201d I had just spotted Alesa trying to work her way over with a wicked gleam in her eyes. I glanced at Laurie and she got the message.</p><p>\u201cAwesome. We did a pyramid. I was near the top. Totally rocked it.\u201d Jenny chattered on. She grabbed a Coke off the table, took a sip and never stopped talking. The parents gazed at her adoringly. Even Penny smiled indulgently.</p> <p>I wanted to put in a few words about the valuable research Penny did every night but realized it wouldn\u2019t matter. Normal life versus our weird vampire subculture? Forget it. Penny worked on things that these mortals would and could never know about, never care about. If a vampire got to see daylight or eat a taco? So what?</p><p>In fact they\u2019d freak if they knew they had a vampire daughter. So they\u2019d stay in blissful ignorance. But it wasn\u2019t so blissful for the daughter who couldn\u2019t brag about her life to them. Or let them know that her boyfriend was really a shape-shifter who could, damn it, become just about anything he could visualize. And how cool was that? Much cooler than Darren getting set to play varsity basketball next month.</p><p>I saw Laurie and Alesa exchange a few words on the other side of the room before I made a lame excuse and dragged Jerry away from the party. Rafe walked up just then, Trey not far behind him.</p><p>\u201cI just heard from the bartender that Alesa\u2019s been bragging that she\u2019s moving in with you again. Is that right, Glory?\u201d Rafe looked ready to blow.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s broke. Needs a place to stay. Where else can she go? At least till we know about this baby.\u201d I had three pairs of eyes on me. \u201cTrey? You need something?\u201d He really wasn\u2019t supposed to be in on this.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want Penny living with a demon.\u201d He kept his voice low and I was sure the high volume of the music kept us from being overheard.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I. But what choice do I have? Penny\u2019s my fledgling to mentor.\u201d I glanced up at the balcony. Damian was still there. He hadn\u2019t brought a date but had danced with several mortal women who\u2019d apparently come to the club single. One of them was draped over him now, probably destined to become his late-night snack.</p><p>\u201cI see where you\u2019re looking. I already asked him. As head of the vampire council, Damian can decide if Penny still needs a mentor or not. He says with her steady job, relationship with Ian, who many on the council respect, and her months of successful blending, he\u2019s willing to let her live on her own now.\u201d Trey nodded, like he had a mental checklist. Done and done.</p> <p>\u201cReally? You just took it upon yourself to jump into our business?\u201d I heard my voice rise but, come on, this was my fledgling we were talking about. I\u2019d taken her from pathetic and angry child wearing black lipstick and horizontal stripes to a self-assured woman who looked good and could blend anywhere. Not only that, she could walk among these delicious mortals surrounding us right now and not show a hint of fang. There were some older vamps who couldn\u2019t manage that.</p><p>\u201cI love her, Glory. I\u2019m only thinking of what\u2019s best for her.\u201d Trey made serious eye contact, begging me to understand.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. I get it. I love Penny too. And she\u2019s so smart, she\u2019d think she could handle whatever Alesa dishes out. Am I right?\u201d I worked up a smile. Nice that Trey had proclaimed his love like that. Penny had snagged a keeper. I realized Rafe and Jerry were both tense, not pleased with the way Trey had challenged me. I didn\u2019t see anything wrong with Trey\u2019s attitude. We were on the same page\u2014worrying about Penny and wanting her away from Alesa. I let him see that in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cThen she\u2019s going. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d Trey turned on his heel and marched toward the family table where Penny still chatted with her parents. Jenny and date were back on the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cThe shifter could have shown more respect.\u201d Jerry eased his hand around my waist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him. He shouldn\u2019t be pushing into vamp business. It can get him in trouble.\u201d Rafe glanced at me. \u201cHe\u2019s letting his emotions cloud his judgment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happens. I think it\u2019s sweet. Penny\u2019s a lucky girl.\u201d I nodded to where Trey had pulled Penny out to dance with him. The song was slow and romantic. It was the kind I liked to dance to, but I knew better than to pick from the two men next to me.</p><p>\u201cLaurie\u2019s managing Alesa pretty well.\u201d Rafe had his hands in his pockets. \u201cShe\u2019s kept her away from Penny\u2019s table and, more important, away from you. There\u2019s no way she should have bulldozed you into having her in your home though. I\u2019m going to try to get her to move in with me. I\u2019d hate it but it\u2019s my mess, not yours.\u201d</p><p>Rafe looked like he\u2019d just been sentenced to life without parole as he trudged over to where Alesa leaned against the bar watching us as she sipped water. It didn\u2019t take vamp hearing to see that she wasn\u2019t interested in his proposition. Which made me wonder exactly what she was up to.</p><p>Alesa stomped up to me. \u201cHave you seen his digs, Glory? I made a little trip over there when I first got to town. Not that he invited me.\u201d She sniffed when Rafe growled. \u201cBachelor shithouse. I wouldn\u2019t take a shower in that place on a bet.\u201d She looped her arm through mine. \u201cSorry, pal, but you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hire a cleaning crew. Redecorate. Just leave Glory the hell alone.\u201d Rafe looked around as he started to jerk Alesa\u2019s hand off of me. Apparently he thought better of it with the crowd of mortals around us. \u201cI thought this is what you wanted, for us to be a family.\u201d</p><p>Alesa sneered. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m thinking your whole attitude since I\u2019ve got here reeks. A family doesn\u2019t have to be a mommy and daddy. It can be Auntie Glory and Mommy. If you\u2019re lucky, maybe I\u2019ll grant you some visitation after the little devil gets here.\u201d</p><p>Rafe gave Laurie a look over my head. \u201cMeet Laurie, another member of the family. She\u2019ll be staying with Glory now. Maybe you\u2019ll change your mind about where you want to live after you get better acquainted.\u201d</p><p>Alesa turned and scoped Laurie out. Her hiss was pure displeasure. \u201cThis just proves how unfit you are to be a father figure. Bringing in one of these.\u201d She turned to me. \u201cGlory, are you really on board with having this creature in your home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she makes you unhappy? Bring her on.\u201d I smiled at Laurie then Rafe. \u201cThanks for trying, Rafe. And, Alesa, since you\u2019ve figured out how to get money now, maybe you would be happier in a hotel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you\u2019re not getting rid of me that easily.\u201d And with that Alesa flounced off to the edge of the dance floor where she gestured and soon had a man pulling her into a dance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to know why she\u2019s so intent on sticking with you, Gloriana, but right now you look like you could use a dance too.\u201d Jerry clasped my hand. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure Valdez has business to tend to.\u201d Jerry didn\u2019t bother to ask, he knew me too well. He just pulled me out to the dance floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I melted into his arms, glad to let the stress of the night go. I felt several pairs of eyes on me again, not all of them kind. Figuring out Alesa was beyond me for now. At least I was safe for the moment, and anyone who tried to take me out could damn well expect to become a statue on the spot.</p><p>I closed my eyes. Oh, yeah. Just try to mess with Glory St. Clair. I was powerful, whatever the hell I was. Overconfidence. Of course I was riding for a fall.</p><p>Seven</p> <p>The apartment door opened before I could get my key out.</p><p>\u201cSo this is your guest.\u201d Penny smiled. \u201cWow. Dig the outfit. I\u2019m Penny Patterson, Glory\u2019s fledgling and roommate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlesa.\u201d The demon breezed by me without even a nod for Penny. \u201cI\u2019m starving. Hitting the fridge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what did we do to deserve this?\u201d Penny made a face, obviously remembering her last encounter with demons.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ask. And now she\u2019s bent out of shape because she didn\u2019t pick up any souls tonight for the big guy downstairs.\u201d I waited for a reaction and wasn\u2019t disappointed. Alesa stuck her head out from the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cNot bent. Didn\u2019t give it a real shot. Not that I need to explain myself but I figured why should I go to any trouble for a man who tossed me out in the cold, literally, when I needed him the most?\u201d She made a rude gesture at the floor, sniffed then disappeared into the kitchen again.</p><p>\u201cGood news for the souls in Austin anyway.\u201d I smiled at Penny and settled into a chair. \u201cNow why aren\u2019t you with Trey?\u201d Laurie prowled the apartment while keeping an eye on Alesa. If Laurie were in her cat form, her tail would be twitching.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still at work, helping with closing. He wanted me to stay, hang out, but where\u2019s the fun in that? Besides, I thought I should touch base with you without a crowd around.\u201d Penny sat in the other chair. We could hear Alesa rummaging in the kitchen. \u201cGuess I could ask you\u2014where\u2019s Mr. Blade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness call. He owns casinos in several states. Which is ironic considering I\u2019m a recovering gambler.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing Texas doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Penny jumped when she heard a noise from the kitchen. Clearly Alesa was making her nervous. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Sunday, Glory. You up for church? I figured it would be a demon-free zone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that too.\u201d Alesa sang from the kitchen. She stopped in the doorway to pry the lid off a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s. \u201cSeriously, you girls need to embrace your dark side. It\u2019s fun over here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChurch without demons sounds like a bit of Heaven to me.\u201d I grinned at Penny. \u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d We usually did attend the Sunday evening services at the Moonlight Church of Eternal Life and Joy. No way a demon could get past the giant crosses flanking the doorway. Not unless she was trapped inside a really good person. I sent Alesa a mental reminder of that little incident. She popped me back with a comment too ugly to repeat.</p><p>Penny frowned when Alesa dropped onto the couch and dug a spoon into the ice cream.</p><p>\u201cWhere did that come from? And do you have to eat it in front of us?\u201d Penny sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s just cruel and unusual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, vamp girl. Having trouble adjusting? Rafael bought it for me.\u201d Alesa scooped up a big spoonful of Chunky Monkey, waved it in front of us and then stuffed it in her mouth. \u201cMmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemon bitch,\u201d Penny muttered.</p><p>\u201cThanks, sweet thing. Words like those are music to my ears.\u201d Alesa smiled and licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cOkay, enough. Now, Penny, how was the football game? You handle the crowd all right?\u201d I turned my shoulder to Alesa.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Jenny was in her element of course. And the home team won. It was fun being in the crowd. I could pretend for a few hours that I was, you know, normal.\u201d Penny sighed. \u201cAnyway, I loaded up on the synthetic blood first, of course, just like you taught me. Didn\u2019t flash my fangs once.\u201d She seemed to shake off her regrets and suddenly grinned. \u201cI really came by because I have big news! Trey\u2019s asked me to move in with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow! Are you ready for that step?\u201d I kept my thoughts blocked. So Trey\u2019s solution to getting Penny out of here was to have her with him. Nice of him, but was Penny really ready to live with the shifter? If he was only doing this to keep her safe\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou know I can read through your puny vampire mind blocks, Glory. Are you really going to bring the kid down with a bunch of objections? She\u2019s in looove.\u201d The way Alesa said the \u201cl\u201d word made it sound like a disease that had to run its course. She had stretched out on the couch, the ice cream carton empty on the table, the spoon inside it. \u201cLet the girl enjoy her hot stud while the fire\u2019s still burning. You know what I mean?\u201d The demon grinned. \u201cHah! Sure you do. You should poke around in Nickel\u2019s mind. The girl gets some good lovin\u2019. Don\u2019t you\u2014what does he call you?\u2014love bunny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, not Nickel. And excuse me? You, you\u2019re reading through my block?\u201d Penny jumped up, clearly outraged. \u201cHow, how rude!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother compliment. Quit kissing up, will ya?\u201d Alesa yawned. \u201cGlad to hear you\u2019re going. I can move right into your little bedroom. Love the rat perfume you\u2019ve got going on. Makes me hungry, but then just about everything does these days.\u201d She patted her tummy.</p><p>I shuddered at the thought of Alesa right down the hall. Obviously she\u2019d never be civilized. I saw Penny\u2019s horrified expression and knew the sooner my fledgling got away from her, the better.</p><p>\u201cI hate to admit it, but Alesa\u2019s right about one thing. Follow your heart, Penny. You and Trey have been going together for months. If you want to take the next step toward commitment, go for it. Just don\u2019t feel like you have to rush into something because this thing is camping out here. I\u2019ve got Laurie for protection now. We should be perfectly safe with her watching over us.\u201d I felt the heat of Alesa\u2019s eyes flaming my way. \u201cI know living with a demon isn\u2019t exactly on your top ten list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be as safe as if you were in church, Penny. Count on it. So stay if you\u2019re not ready to shack up with your boyfriend. I\u2019ll keep Ms. Alesa in line.\u201d Laurie began to pull things out of the duffle bag she\u2019d brought up from her car she\u2019d left parked outside N-V. \u201cBurning some cleansing incense right now. Suggest you move your butt down the hall, demon. This is going to sting. Though we\u2019d purely enjoy watching you crying and reaching for a tissue. Am I right, ladies?\u201d Laurie grinned as she waved a branch of what looked like weeds and clicked a lighter to set them aflame.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going. That shit is nasty!\u201d Alesa hurried down the hall toward Penny\u2019s old room. \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if I start emptying drawers and tossing stuff into the hallway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill she?\u201d Penny sniffed. \u201cI think this incense or whatever smells nice. Beats the hell out of the rat poop stench I\u2019ve been sleeping with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019ll probably throw out your stuff, but if you\u2019re moving...\u201d I stood and waited while Penny got up too. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I love Trey. And I want to be with him. Maybe this hurried our relationship along a little, but I\u2019m okay with that. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like some of your space back.\u201d She glanced at her big computer set up on my kitchen table. She\u2019d used it when she\u2019d still been doing research at the University of Texas. Now she did most of her work on Ian\u2019s state-of-the-art equipment in his lab. But I was sure it would go with her. She\u2019d even named it. She\u2019d also brought her cat. I\u2019d grown really attached to Boogie and if she wanted to leave him here, I was fine with it.</p><p>\u201cI loved having you here. Don\u2019t leave on my account.\u201d I hugged her. \u201cI just want you to be happy. But getting away from Alesa is probably a good idea.\u201d Penny and I grinned when Laurie started chanting and circling the room with her smoking weeds. \u201cEven with Laurie here, there\u2019s still danger. I don\u2019t want you anywhere near the demon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s why Trey asked me this tonight. He\u2019s sweet, wanting to look after me. Kind of like how Mr. Blade always wants to protect you.\u201d Penny peered down the hall and frowned. \u201cShe just dumped my underwear drawer. Can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing Alesa does surprises me.\u201d Did I dare warn Penny about protective men? Should I? They meant well. Too bad they sometimes went too far, didn\u2019t know when protection became control. Some lessons we needed to learn for ourselves. And Trey wasn\u2019t Jerry. Maybe he knew not to cross that line with Penny.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d Laurie\u2019s growl, when half of Penny\u2019s closet landed just feet from the bathroom, made the hair on my arms stand on end. She stormed down the hall and we heard Penny\u2019s bedroom door slam.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she?\u201d Penny clutched my hand.</p><p>\u201cWere-cat. Turns into a Bengal tiger. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough space in your crowded room for her to shift, but she says she\u2019s also got some kind of mystical mojo going, besides the incense, that can handle a demon.\u201d I sighed and sat back in a chair again. \u201cI hope she\u2019s right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool. And the energy in here already feels better. Bet Mr. Blade brought her in. Did he?\u201d Penny began dumping papers into a cardboard box.</p><p>\u201cHe and Rafe got together on it.\u201d I glanced down the hall, expecting noise of some kind, but it was eerily quiet. \u201cWhere demons are concerned, I let my independent woman thing go and allow them to pay the freight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m glad.\u201d Penny started unplugging wires. \u201cTrey wants me out of here tonight and I\u2019m glad about that too. He\u2019s bringing a truck after he finishes closing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I watched her for a moment then closed my eyes, life without a headache a dim memory. \u201cI know it\u2019s for the best.\u201d Penny had come to mean a lot to me and I really would miss her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou know how I was raised, Glory. With Gramps a preacher, we practically lived at the church. I can\u2019t handle all this evil in my face all the time.\u201d I felt a hand on my knee and saw Penny squatting in front of me. \u201cWhy are you putting up with it, Glory? Why is she here?\u201d</p><p>Alesa stood in the doorway, a frowning Laurie right behind her. \u201cBecause Glory wants to know if this baby is Rafe\u2019s, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it can\u2019t be Rafe\u2019s.\u201d I gave her a hard look. I was sick of this particular lie.</p><p>Penny\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cThis is Rafe\u2019s baby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Alesa claims she got pregnant while her spirit or whatever inhabited me. Isn\u2019t that insane?\u201d I shuddered and appealed to Penny. My fledgling was smart and logical, a scientist. Like Ian, she would surely back me up that this couldn\u2019t be true.</p><p>\u201cWell...\u201d She frowned, obviously thinking it over. \u201cCome on, Glory. The whole idea of vampires and demons even existing is insane. After I woke up with my own pair of fangs, I learned not to discount the possibility of anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI simply refuse to buy into it.\u201d I felt Laurie\u2019s hand drop onto my shoulder, a warm weight that comforted me.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t say I was buying it. But I know Ian came over here this week about that other thing.\u201d She patted my hand. Penny turned to Alesa, who\u2019d strolled over to stretch out on the couch again. To say that the demon cared less what we thought was an understatement. \u201cIs he working with you too? As a doctor, he wouldn\u2019t discuss a case with me. I swear he never mentioned your name, Alesa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s my obstetrician. Good to know he\u2019s sticking to the doctor/patient privilege thing.\u201d Alesa smiled. \u201cBut, hey, you seem pretty smart. For a vampire.\u201d She flicked me with a dismissive glance. \u201cAnd I like your open mind. So tell him I want you on my case too. He can fill you in. We have an appointment Monday night. He\u2019s going to do an ultrasound so we can get a sneak peek at my little bundle of joy. You can be there for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow. Oh, just wow.\u201d Penny\u2019s eyes were wide.</p><p>\u201cThat is if you\u2019re all moved out by dawn today.\u201d Alesa examined her fingernails. \u201cOh, and I didn\u2019t have time to steal much from that cheesy hotel Rafael took me to. You could leave me a few essentials. Some hair product. A manicure set.\u201d She eyed Penny\u2019s size fourteen figure. \u201cNo clothes, obviously. But I have magic fingers. I make my own.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI can do the rest too. But sometimes it\u2019s fun to play human, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no, I don\u2019t.\u201d Penny glanced at me, then down at her feet, thinking.</p><p>\u201cOh, give it up, Penny.\u201d I put my fledgling out of her misery, obviously she was torn between loyalty to me and her thirst for knowledge. \u201cI know what a chance to study a demon would mean to you. Ian was all over it too. I\u2019m sure God and Gramps would understand. I do.\u201d This time I hit Alesa with my own look. \u201cHow often do you get to play doctor with a real freak?\u201d</p><p>Alesa hissed but Laurie was right there, between us, before the demon could do more than mutter a few choice words. I was so loving my new bodyguard.</p><p>I got up and patted Penny on the back. \u201cGo, be happy with Trey. And tell Ian to let you assist him on this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeriously? I won\u2019t be abandoning you?\u201d Penny hugged me hard when I shook my head. \u201cThis is so cool of you. You\u2019re right about this rare scientific opportunity. A pregnant demon. Radical.\u201d Penny let me go and approached Alesa. \u201cCan I, uh, feel your stomach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnock yourself out. Nice to see someone appreciates me.\u201d Alesa lay back, her hands behind her head. \u201cLittle devil loved the ice cream. He\u2019s kicking up a storm.\u201d</p><p>Penny cautiously laid a palm on Alesa\u2019s rounded tummy, on top of the black leather. \u201cThis isn\u2019t any good. Leather\u2019s too thick. Can I pull up your top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why not? I\u2019m not modest.\u201d Alesa grinned at me. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got nothing to be ashamed of. Even pregnant, my stomach\u2019s flatter than somebody\u2019s on their best day. Right, Glory?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to slap the smug smile off her face. Of course Alesa had given herself a beautiful human package. Penny pulled up the demon\u2019s top and laid her hand on porcelain skin. Then my fledgling jumped and squealed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I ran around the coffee table to her side.</p><p>\u201cIt moved.\u201d Penny looked at me then back down at Alesa\u2019s stomach. Sure enough, you could see something undulating under there, like a serpent trying to escape. I shivered. Penny cautiously laid her hand on the skin again.</p><p>\u201cYou can feel it, right?\u201d Alesa laughed. \u201cTry it, Glory. You\u2019re a witness. You can tell Rafael that there really is something inside me. My baby. Our baby.\u201d</p> <p>I was fascinated and not a little creeped out but I put my hand beside Penny\u2019s. Sure enough, I felt something stir under Alesa\u2019s warm, silky skin. I don\u2019t know what I expected, but it actually wasn\u2019t creepy. Instead, I felt sorry for whatever was growing inside her. Because that tiny creature was doomed. Rafe was right. Alesa for a mother. What a future.</p><p>\u201cWhat about me? Can I join the party?\u201d Laurie peered over the back of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cNo! You think I don\u2019t see your intentions, tiger? You\u2019d like nothing better than to rid the world of a demon before it had a chance to see daylight.\u201d Alesa glared at Laurie. \u201cStay away from me. I mean it.\u201d</p><p>The were-cat just smiled and nodded. Penny and I backed away. Alesa had actually seemed\u2014dare I say it?\u2014afraid of Laurie. I nodded at my bodyguard approvingly then followed Penny down the hall to help her pack. What do you know? My headache was actually gone. Seemed a little positive energy and a fierce were-cat were better than Excedrin.</p><p>Too bad I had another headache in my future. I\u2019d never gotten around to telling Jerry about my new statue skill. He\u2019d had an urgent business call while we were at the club. Yes, at 1:30 in the morning. That\u2019s a vampire\u2019s life for you.</p><p>\u201cFinally, we\u2019re away from that demon\u2019s reek. Insane that you\u2019re actually letting her live with you.\u201d Jerry dragged me out into the hall and up the stairs to the roof.</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t want to argue about it, Jer.\u201d I jerked my hand from his. \u201cInsane\u201d? His word choice hit me wrong, that was for sure. \u201cWhere are we going? If you don\u2019t mind my asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhere we can talk without all those people around.\u201d He opened the door to the rooftop and cool air hit my warm cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAll those people? Penny and Trey were trying to move her stuff. You could have offered to help.\u201d I strode to the edge of the roof and looked down at the alley. Trey had borrowed a pickup truck and I could see half of it already filled with boxes. Penny\u2019s precious computer was going last, in the backseat of her car. She\u2019d asked if her cat could stay with me for a while and I\u2019d been happy to agree.</p><p>\u201cThe shifter can handle things by himself and you and I need to get this settled between us.\u201d Jerry stood next to me, his temper fairly vibrating the air between us.</p><p>\u201cSettled? Doubt it. Because in your mind that means I\u2019ll stand back and let Laurie do whatever it is she does to run Alesa out of there. It\u2019s tempting. I admit it.\u201d I could see in his face that I\u2019d hit the target. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to stir the pot, Jer. An angry demon is a dangerous demon. So I\u2019m just going to let Alesa park in Penny\u2019s bedroom and then I\u2019ll go with her to Ian\u2019s Monday night. Where\u2019s the harm?\u201d I smiled at him, but I knew my fangs were showing. I was pissed at the way he\u2019d rudely dragged me out of there. I\u2019d wanted to help Penny with the move.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re in over your head, Gloriana. There\u2019s only so much protection Laurie can offer.\u201d Jerry actually tried to take me into his arms. I wasn\u2019t having it.</p><p>\u201cMy female, less than equal to the task, head.\u201d I threw myself across the roof. Yeah, I was definitely in a snit. \u201cGod, Jerry, when will you get me? You may think I\u2019m dumb as dirt. Or na\u00efve. But would you at least pretend to respect my decisions?\u201d I swear, if I were a demon, my eyes would be flamethrowers. Lucky for Jerry, I just had my fangs to show how truly furious I was. Too bad he\u2019d see a move by me to rip out his throat as foreplay.</p><p>Four hundred years and it came to this. Block-headed Scotsman. Why did I still love him? I swept my eyes over him. Sure, he had a hot body but lust only went so far. And, yes, he protected me and cared about me, but that felt more and more like a suffocating blanket and less and less like the warm fuzzy comfort it had in the beginning.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, you\u2019ve made many excellent decisions. But you tend to trust people who simply aren\u2019t trustworthy.\u201d Jerry didn\u2019t come close, staying on his side of the roof. Okay, at least he realized that trying to win me over with a sexual move right now would send me screaming into the sky.</p><p>\u201cRafe? Ian? Or both, Jerry?\u201d I leaned against the metal door to the roof. I had no intention of letting anyone interrupt this long overdue showdown. \u201cNever mind. Don\u2019t bother. I know the answer. Once a person hits your shit list, that\u2019s it. No second chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things are simply unforgivable, Gloriana. I don\u2019t know why you can\u2019t understand that.\u201d Jerry was stony-faced. Not promising.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll never understand that.\u201d I wasn\u2019t about to bring up the most obvious problem Jerry had with Rafe\u2014my affair with the shifter. Unforgivable? Jerry had seemed to give me a pass while putting all the blame on Rafe. Obviously Gloriana was easily manipulated, putty in a bad man\u2019s hands.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll never understand why you persist in your dealings with MacDonald. What are you trying to prove?\u201d Jerry\u2019s fists hit his hard thighs.</p><p>\u201cProve?\u201d I heard my voice rise and took a breath. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about you. Get it? So Ian made the mistake of having the last name MacDonald. Big freakin\u2019 deal. He\u2019s a doctor. We need a doctor. That\u2019s all there is to it. He\u2019s not done one thing to warrant your continued suspicion of him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s done nothing? What\u2019s this then?\u201d Jerry stood in front of me in an instant, lifting my shirt to poke at my swollen stomach with a blunt fingertip.</p><p>I gasped. \u201cReally? Is it so offensive? Don\u2019t look at it then.\u201d I jerked down my top. I\u2019d changed into low-riding jeans and a green tank to help Penny pack. Bad choice since the knit clung in all the wrong places.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not offensive except as a reminder of what MacDonald\u2019s drug did to you.\u201d Jerry actually tried to drag the top up again. \u201cYou are always beautiful to me, no matter how strange your stomach looks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKeep talking, Jerry, and you will never see me naked again.\u201d I darted to the opposite side of the roof.</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t come out right. Besides, that\u2019s minor compared to this latest nonsense he\u2019s filling your head with\u2014blood with powers, making you out to be some kind of paranormal entity. It\u2019s insane!\u201d He held both hands up, obviously still unsure how to make his unwieldy tongue push out the right words. \u201cOn some subjects, such as your loyalty to Valdez, you\u2019ve lost all perspective. There\u2019s no reason to risk your immortal soul to protect the man\u2019s by-blow.\u201d He gave me a narrow-eyed look. \u201cUnless there\u2019s more between you two than I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know there\u2019s not anything going on now except friendship. And my immortal soul?\u201d I clenched my fists. \u201cYou\u2019re assuming I ever had one. News flash, Jer. Whatever I am may not be in the running for a nice hereafter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you have a soul. You\u2019re good, Gloriana. Too good for Valdez with his demon taint. You\u2019ve got to know that Alesa\u2019s story of conceiving while inside you is bullshit. If that baby is his, then it\u2019s clear he bedded the she-demon before or after she inhabited your body. He did marry her once. What does that say about his standards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLay off, Jerry. Even you were young and foolish once. Does the name Mara ring a bell?\u201d I had him there. His ex made Alesa look positively angelic. Mara had a history of lying that included keeping the truth about who her daughter\u2019s father was for hundreds of years. That\u2019s why Jerry had only recently learned he had a daughter, made before he was turned vampire.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to change the subject.\u201d Jerry had crossed the roof, close now. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about Valdez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe denies sleeping with the demon and that\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d I was so tired of Jerry always taking the wrong side of these arguments.</p><p>\u201cValdez has demon blood. Lying is like breathing to those creatures. Why are you forgetting that?\u201d Jerry tried to approach me again. \u201cYou\u2019re letting your fondness for him overcome your common sense. Think, Gloriana. The man is not who you thought he was. He played a part with you for five years. Now he\u2019s finally showing his true colors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe played a part because you paid him to do it, Jerry!\u201d I felt my temper explode. I wanted to hurt him for not seeing my side of things. Damn him for being so blind and stubborn.</p><p>\u201cCalm down. See reason, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry reached for me. That did it. Rafe bashing, discounting my own instincts, I\u2019d had it. I concentrated and he froze where he stood.</p><p>Yep, I turned Jerry, the love of my life, to stone. He couldn\u2019t even blink but his eyes burned as he realized what I\u2019d done to him. I backed away. For a moment I actually gloated. Hah! Look what Glory could do. Then I came crashing down to earth.</p> <p>Oh, God. What now? A quick thaw? Or should I explain this while I had a captive audience? Because he sure as hell wouldn\u2019t listen to a thing I had to say once he was mobile again.</p><p>\u201cUh, sorry about that. Meant to tell you. While I was with Alesa earlier, she said she discovered I had some untapped powers when she was inside me. Part of my non-human thing, I guess. She taught me the statue trick. I take it as proof that Ian didn\u2019t lie about that at least. That I started out as some kind of paranormal.\u201d I gulped and tears stung my eyes. \u201cJerry?\u201d This was bad, very bad. I could read his thoughts and they weren\u2019t words he usually used around me. Jerry hated feeling or being helpless. As a warrior it was his worst nightmare.</p><p>\u201cYou see? This could be a clue about what I am, er, was.\u201d I was babbling, stalling. This wasn\u2019t going to be pretty when I released Jerry from the freeze. Had to do it. I stared at him, wisely put a dozen feet between us first, then did the deed.</p><p>He whirled as if testing his freedom, then glared at me. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. A new skill.\u201d I took a shaky breath. He was stalking me, bearing down like he was intent on shaking me until my fangs rattled. I deserved it.</p><p>\u201cAnd you used it on me,\u201d Jerry ground out, mere inches from me now.</p><p>\u201cS-s-sorry about that. Really. But you made me lose my temper.\u201d I backed up until I hit that door to the stairs.</p><p>Jerry slapped his hands against the steel on either side of my head. He leaned down until his breath touched my cheek. \u201cSorry? Sorry that you made me look foolish, standing there unable to so much as twitch?\u201d He wound my hair around his hand, his voice so menacing I felt my knees go weak.</p> <p>He wasn\u2019t hurting me, but I could feel the pressure and see the urge to kill in his set jaw.</p><p>\u201cJerry, please. I didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make me helpless? To shut me up so you could win your argument?\u201d He watched as I licked my dry lips and I saw heat flare in his eyes.</p><p>Oh, no. Arguing had fired his blood, made him want to punish me. Show me that he was stronger than I was, as long as I didn\u2019t cheat with powers that came from God knew where. His gaze roamed over my body where my top clung to nipples suddenly alert to his nearness. Stupid knee-jerk response. He pressed closer, obviously aroused, and I reacted shamelessly before I could stop myself. Down, Glory. I\u2019d be damned if I\u2019d let this end in bed.</p><p>\u201cBed? Of course I\u2019m reading your thoughts. Why don\u2019t I just drag you down to this concrete and take you there?\u201d He gave my hair a sharp tug. \u201cBut I\u2019d never make it, would I? You\u2019d turn me to stone before my thought became deed. What else has the demon bitch taught you? Can you read through my blocked thoughts now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. Haven\u2019t, um, tried. But I wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d I slid my hands across his chest. \u201cI will never, ever do that to you again, Jerry. It was a mistake. Unfair. No, mean. And I love you too much to do that to you.\u201d I did press against him, deliberately this time, and reveled in the taut proof of his lust. It would be so easy to settle this that way and so wrong. \u201cI hated seeing you like that. Helpless.\u201d Shut up, Glory.</p><p>\u201cNo more than I hated feeling that way.\u201d He hadn\u2019t released my hair but he did ease the pressure. \u201cI want to hear you swear it, Gloriana. With your mind open. That you will never use that power against me again.\u201d His lips were within a breath of mine.</p><p>\u201cYes, I promise, Jerry. I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly. I\u2019ll never do it again.\u201d I leaned the inch it took to touch my lips to his. \u201cPlease forgive me. My temper got the best of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never used to have a temper.\u201d He released my curls and ran his hand down my throat, stroking my pounding pulse there.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s living with a demon. I won\u2019t deny it\u2019s working on my last nerve. I could really use some sympathy here instead of another lecture.\u201d I stretched my neck when he followed his hand with his lips.</p><p>\u201cYet you\u2019re allowing her to teach you tricks such as this statue maneuver.\u201d He raised his head and stared down at me. \u201cIt\u2019s a valuable defense. I\u2019m glad you have it. Though it raises questions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d I slid my hands up to twine in his hair. \u201cWhat can I be that I have this power? Thank God Alesa assures me that I\u2019m not demon. Not that I ever thought I could be. I do attend church, hold crosses, talk to God. All things a demon can\u2019t do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. And I\u2019ll say again that, except when you\u2019re in a temper, you\u2019re a fine and decent person, Gloriana.\u201d Jerry finally smiled.</p><p>\u201cI owe you some serious groveling to make this up to you.\u201d I ran a fingertip around his ear then traced a scar just visible in the open collar of his shirt. \u201cPerhaps ending up in bed isn\u2019t such a bad idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like an interesting proposition. But it won\u2019t be in that apartment of yours. It smells like Willy Wonka\u2019s candy factory down there.\u201d Jerry frowned. \u201cAnd knowing the demon is down the hall is a real joy killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilly Wonka?\u201d I laughed. \u201cWhat do you know of such things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter decided we needed to catch up on some of the things parents did with their children when they are growing up. She rented a pile of children\u2019s movies and made me watch a marathon of DVDs. That was one of them.\u201d Jerry laughed. \u201cIt was a nice evening. The kind a mortal family would share. Beat the hell out of Lily bringing home another undesirable male.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMovie night sounds like fun. Next time I\u2019d like in on it.\u201d I leaned against him. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to go home with you and grovel. But not tonight. It\u2019s late and I wouldn\u2019t have time to do a proper job. Maybe tomorrow after church? What do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say that if I can\u2019t change your mind about your current situation, I\u2019ll take what I can get.\u201d He rubbed my back and we just held each other for a long moment. \u201cChurch, eh? I bet your demon didn\u2019t like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. So of course Penny and I wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d I kept my arms around Jerry\u2019s waist, appreciating how solid he felt.</p><p>\u201cTell me, are there any more powers lurking inside you that the demon knows of? Anything else she can teach you?\u201d Jerry looked into my eyes. \u201cYou know I\u2019m all about defense. And if you can use the creature while she\u2019s camped in your apartment, I say you should take full advantage.\u201d He brushed my hair back from my face. \u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t cost you your soul.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo worries. My soul stays where it is.\u201d I sighed. \u201cAlesa did mention there might be more untapped powers, but to learn them I\u2019ll have to go along with her notion that we can be like sisters.\u201d I shuddered. \u201cCan you imagine? With a family like that, I\u2019d fall on the first available stake.\u201d</p><p>Jerry started to speak, then shut his mouth. Restraint. Because I knew exactly what he\u2019d started to say. If it bothered me so much I could forget Rafe\u2019s involvement and kick Alesa to the curb. No secret power was worth putting up with her. I patted his cheek then traced the curve of his firm lips.</p><p>\u201cNice job. Can we move on to the kiss-and-make-up portion of the evening now?\u201d I smiled at him and looped my arms around his neck.</p> <p>Jerry glanced around at the plain concrete rooftop, then up at the clear night sky. \u201cWe have an hour until dawn and a bit of privacy. I think there\u2019s time for full-on make-up sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn this hard concrete?\u201d I sighed when he slipped his hand under my top. I pulled his head down for a deep and satisfying kiss. At least we\u2019d moved on from the statue thing and the endless fight about Ian, Rafe and the demon. And I was happy to put off going downstairs. My home was no refuge, that was for sure.</p><p>Jerry sent me a mental message and we were soon shifting to fly to a deserted area of a nearby park. There was a stream glittering in the moonlight and a cushion of leaves on the ground for a bed.</p><p>\u201cAm I allowed to see you naked, lass?\u201d His eyes gleamed as we shifted to our human forms beneath a large oak tree. \u201cOr did my unruly tongue get me into too much trouble for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour tongue can be unruly. Or very talented.\u201d I sauntered up to Jerry and toyed with the collar of his shirt. \u201cNaughty as well.\u201d I made quick work of his buttons and tossed the shirt away. \u201cI think I shall make you work for a glimpse of my hideous stomach.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGloriana.\u201d Jerry groaned when I bent my head to lick a path along the muscles of his chest. I sucked one brown nipple into my mouth, then the other, enjoying the way his hands clutched my back as I gave him pleasure. I did so love to have him in my power.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201d I lay back on the bed of leaves and held out my hands. \u201cWhatever I do to you, do to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith pleasure.\u201d He fell on top of me, making quick work of my top and then my bra. He gazed down at my breasts, his eyes bright with lust. \u201cYou are beautiful. I never tire of this sight.\u201d He bent his head to swirl his tongue around each peak, causing me to gasp. If he never tired, the wonder of it was that I never failed to feel that new bite of ecstasy when he touched me. You\u2019d think the feelings would wane, grow stale after hundreds of years. And yet each time was as thrilling as the first. As if a magic spell had been cast on us.</p><p>\u201cJerry.\u201d I gripped his hair and pulled him closer as he suckled me, the draw of his mouth and the scrape of his fangs making my womb throb with longing. Finally I gently pushed him away. \u201cMy turn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d His eyes were drowsy as he lay back and slid his hand across my waist. \u201cWhat\u2019s your pleasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake off your jeans, your shoes. Well, hell, just strip off.\u201d I grinned. \u201cI\u2019m feeling much too lazy to do the job myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWonder why.\u201d He grinned and went to work on his belt, the sound of his zipper sending a thrill through me that made me reach for my own. We raced to see who could get naked first. He won, of course. My jeans never came off easily. I struggled with spandex.</p><p>\u201cDid I ever tell you how beautiful you are?\u201d I gazed down at him, spread out for my taking. He had a rough masculine beauty that made me sigh. His sex stood tall and ready, the hair dark and curling around it. His legs were long and well muscled and his scars from long-ago battles just made him even more desirable in my eyes. I leaned over him to trail my hair over his body, across his cock, up over his stomach and then back down again.</p><p>\u201cA man is not beautiful.\u201d He slid his hands over my ass and tried to hold me still above him. \u201cThis, this is beauty. These full breasts that taste like heaven. This sweet, wet crease that is the gate to paradise.\u201d He nudged my legs apart with his knee. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s this ass, so round and soft that I could write poetry to it if I had the words for such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you just did.\u201d I sighed as he explored me, our game deteriorating into a sensual slide of skin on skin, lips to skin and then lips to lips. He pulled me up to probe me with his tongue until I bucked and could stand it no longer. I cried out and grabbed his ears, twisting until he shoved me down hard on his cock. It filled me as another orgasm surged through me and I heard him shout my name. We breathed together, an old habit from our human days.</p><p>No, I\u2019d not had human days. But I must have known how humans made love. Jerry and I had spent nights together before he\u2019d turned me. He\u2019d become my lover, teaching me things my husband had never dared. Or had I had a husband at all? My mind whirled, suddenly full of doubts about what was real and what were mere fantasies planted by some unknown entity. Why? Who? How had I really come to be in Jerry\u2019s life?</p><p>As I lay across his chest, still connected to him thigh to thigh, heart to heart, I struggled with these questions and more. If I had never been human, what had I been before? And could Jerry love that, that thing as he loved Gloriana St. Clair? Hah! Even the name was undoubtedly a fiction. I could lose this man, lose everything with the truth. I shuddered and tightened my hold on him. Once again I\u2019d denied him my blood, Ian\u2019s claims about it making me withhold that pleasure. And Jerry had gone along with it. Could Ian have made up all of this? Fooled Penny somehow with his test results? I helped Jerry into his clothes, then he helped me into mine just before dawn and he left me at my door with a sweet kiss. Laurie grinned at me from the couch.</p><p>\u201cThe demon\u2019s made herself at home in Penny\u2019s room. You can relax. She won\u2019t bother you during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, that never occurred to me. Thanks, Laurie.\u201d I took a shower, scrubbing myself clean quickly then falling into bed as I felt the dawn hit me. Demons didn\u2019t seem to ever sleep, which left them plenty of time for mischief. I didn\u2019t like that idea one bit.</p> <p>Eight</p><p>\u201cI thought Rafael was going to be here.\u201d Alesa threw herself out of my car Monday night, ignoring the guards who\u2019d stepped forward as I\u2019d pulled to a stop in front of Ian\u2019s house. \u201cI don\u2019t see his car. Which is probably a good thing. I\u2019m not sure I like his attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he flew in.\u201d I\u2019d listened to her gripe all the way out here. She didn\u2019t want the top down on the convertible. Her tummy was upset. No surprise there. I\u2019d watched her down a frozen bean burrito which she hadn\u2019t bothered nuking, a quart of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, and two packs of Rafe\u2019s Twinkies. Oh, and that was after the nachos she\u2019d become addicted to. My apartment smelled like a mall food court.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t blame him if he skipped this. You gave him an out. I\u2019d jump on it if I were him.\u201d Laurie had managed to pretzel herself into my tiny backseat.</p><p>\u201cWho asked you? And quit breathing down my neck.\u201d Alesa glared at Laurie. \u201cWhat did you have for dinner? A whole cow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I don\u2019t look like one.\u201d The were-cat smirked as she climbed out of the car.</p><p>My stomach heaved. I\u2019d rather whatever Laurie ate during the day remain a mystery. \u201cAlesa, you are going overboard with your eating. I swear you\u2019re bigger tonight than you were when you first arrived a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all baby. And I\u2019m sick of all this negativity.\u201d Alesa slammed the car door, barely missing Laurie\u2019s foot. \u201cIt can\u2019t be good for the little one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d bet demon babies thrive on it, devil woman.\u201d Laurie grinned. \u201cDidn\u2019t you like the surprise under your pillow?\u201d</p><p>Alesa\u2019s screams when she\u2019d discovered an ancient prayer book and crucifix tucked into her bed could have been heard down on Sixth Street. She\u2019d broken land speed records getting away from them and ended up taking Laurie\u2019s spot on the couch, muttering about her room being \u201cdefiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it up, tiger. Your day is coming. When Luc snaps to the fact that he wants me back, he\u2019ll be glad to get even with anyone who caused me pain.\u201d Alesa sniffed.</p><p>\u201cObviously your evening with Laurie wasn\u2019t a success.\u201d I\u2019d gone to church with Penny, then spent the rest of the evening at Jerry\u2019s, leaving Laurie to demon-sit.</p><p>\u201cShe kept chanting, burning her shitty leaves and leaving religious things where I\u2019d trip over them.\u201d Alesa gestured at her with a middle finger. \u201cLeave me with her again and you\u2019ll regret it, Glory.\u201d She shot me a red-eyed look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quaking in my boots.\u201d I glanced down. These were pretty cute but years old. Tomorrow night I\u2019d try to find some new ones. I was actually looking forward to my shopping trip with Aggie and Flo. Another night away from any demon influences. I hated to do it to him but, if necessary, I\u2019d get Rafe to ride herd on Alesa just to keep her safely occupied.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Glory, you\u2019re starting to look like the reason for all those dumb-blond jokes.\u201d Alesa sniffed and tossed her dark hair back over her shoulders. \u201cIf you\u2019re not scared of me, you\u2019re too stupid to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot living, haven\u2019t lived for hundreds of years.\u201d I smiled as Penny opened Ian\u2019s front door. \u201cWe\u2019re here. Please tell me the ultrasound machine arrived and is ready to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Got here during the day. One of the shifters set it up.\u201d Penny gestured for us to come in. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing with it, making sure we know how it works.\u201d She leaned closer and glanced at the silent bodyguards who\u2019d followed us inside. \u201cShifters have the most interesting internal organs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFascinating.\u201d Alesa breezed past us. \u201cWhere\u2019s the doc?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere I am. Valdez and I were conferring. I took a DNA sample from him. To compare with your baby when the time comes.\u201d Ian smiled at me then got serious when he met Alesa\u2019s gaze. The moment he noticed Laurie behind her, he stiffened. \u201cI see you\u2019ve got a new bodyguard. Gloriana? Is she yours?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can speak to me directly, Ian. And don\u2019t pretend we haven\u2019t met.\u201d Laurie smiled tightly. \u201cAnd more.\u201d She shrugged when my eyes widened. \u201cBlade knows about my history with MacDonald. It was a selling feature in my resume. Let\u2019s just say if Ian becomes a target? I won\u2019t hesitate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFierce. Tiger, you have finally said something I can admire.\u201d Alesa looked like she\u2019d enjoy watching a showdown.</p><p>Ian slapped on a smile again. \u201cLauren and I had a bad breakup. I got over it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cObviously.\u201d I looked from Laurie to Ian. The air practically shimmered between them. Heat? Anger? Unresolved issues. Alesa laughed.</p><p>\u201cWho cares? Tonight is all about me. Where\u2019s Rafael now?\u201d She glanced around the large room that reminded me of Ian\u2019s Malibu digs. He favored contemporary furnishings, heavy on the white leather, modern art and lots of glass with a water view. I had to say I liked his style.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s out on the terrace, getting some air. As soon as he got a whiff of demon, his temper got the best of him.\u201d Ian smiled at me. \u201cSays you\u2019ve got him in a twelve-step program for anger management, Gloriana. He\u2019s working right now to calm down before he comes inside to join us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, this is hard for him. And I\u2019m glad he\u2019s gaining some self-control.\u201d Now that I knew where to look, I could see his dark shape outside where he leaned against the stone wall surrounding the large terrace.</p><p>\u201cThis is hard for him?\u201d Alesa started across the large room. \u201cGive me a break. He\u2019s not carrying around the Karate Kid kickboxing his kidneys. I\u2019ll make it hard for him.\u201d</p> <p>Laurie blocked her path. \u201cLet\u2019s go take this test. Where\u2019s the ultrasound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why don\u2019t you show Alesa the dressing room, Penny?\u201d Ian gestured for my fledgling to escort Alesa down a hall. \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to be examined, Alesa, but I\u2019m going to have to do it anyway. Penny will assist me. Undress completely and put on a smock.\u201d Ian was suddenly the doctor at work. \u201cLauren, are you sticking with the demon or staying with Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Laurie, just stay with Alesa.\u201d I could see my bodyguard was clearly torn. \u201cYou know she\u2019s the threat here. And Blade wants you to watch Ian too. So go with them, I\u2019ll be there in a minute. I want to talk to Rafe.\u201d I stopped next to the French doors. \u201cYou know I\u2019ll be okay with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so. Demon watch. Fine. But be careful.\u201d She followed Ian down the hall, stopping once to glance over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll wait outside while you examine the demon, Ian. No way do I want to see her naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want me to examine her. I may call for help. I\u2019m sure you can handle her.\u201d Ian winked at Laurie and she actually flushed. Hmm. Interesting.</p><p>I headed outside. \u201cRafe, got a handle on your anger yet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d He turned and leaned back against the wall. \u201cI can\u2019t have the woman I want, my worst nightmare has come back to haunt me, and I\u2019m supposed to act civilized about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, when you put it like that...\u201d I stood beside him, careful not to touch him. I wasn\u2019t about to encourage him to get closer now. \u201cAnything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet Alesa to admit this is a hoax?\u201d Rafe laughed. \u201cRight. Like that\u2019s going to happen. Damn, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to put up with her. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s fixated on you. How\u2019s Laurie working out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. She\u2019s actually got Alesa on the defensive.\u201d I gave in and touched his shoulder. \u201cRelax, Rafe. You know this has got to be a big lie. Time will tell us the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the problem. The longer I\u2019m around her, the more insane this makes me. How can you stand having her in your apartment? I would have killed her by now. If I could figure out how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s a problem. How do you kill a demon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question. And about time you thought to ask it.\u201d The voice came out of the darkness. Rafe and I both turned. He suddenly had a knife in his hand and I clutched my car keys like a weapon.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Rafe jumped up on the low stone wall, ready to rumble.</p> <p>\u201cOh, get over yourself, shifter. I\u2019m much tougher to kill than a mere demon. Lucky for you I\u2019m not the one with the beef here.\u201d Aggie strolled up a side path that had been carved into the cliff from the lake below. She was wrapped toga-style in a big white towel. Clearly she\u2019d been skinny-dipping in the cold water, her wet hair slicked back behind her ears.</p><p>\u201cThen why sneak up on us? You could have identified yourself sooner.\u201d I reached up for Rafe\u2019s hand as he jumped back to the terrace. \u201cAnd what\u2019s with the eavesdropping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s how I learn the most interesting stuff.\u201d Aggie grinned. \u201cThough you two weren\u2019t exactly spilling your guts. And talk about clueless!\u201d She strolled over to a wrought iron chair and plopped down, crossing one bare leg over the other.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I swear she was flashing Rafe and enjoying his reaction. \u201cDon\u2019t you need to go find some clothes? It\u2019s chilly tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019m a Siren. Water is my element. After a swim like I just had, I\u2019m stoked.\u201d She did rearrange her towel so she wasn\u2019t giving Rafe such an excellent view. \u201cBetter, Glory?\u201d She winked at me. \u201cNow back to demons. The grapevine tells me you two, along with Blade and my dreamboat Israel Caine, took out Honoria not so long ago. Is that true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe goddess the EVs worshipped.\u201d Rafe glanced at me, finally able to tear his gaze from Aggie\u2019s peep show. \u201cYeah, we managed to take her down. What of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat bitch called herself a goddess, but she was nothing more than a three-headed demon. Lots of power, a great line of bullshit, but so not in the hierarchy according to my boss man.\u201d Aggie looked skyward. \u201cAnd he should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Storm God.\u201d I shuddered. My encounters with him had proved he was way too powerful to be taken out with a sword. \u201cCome to think of it, you\u2019re right, Aggie.\u201d I clutched Rafe\u2019s arm. \u201cWe know how to kill a demon. Whack off her head or heads as the case may be. Alesa has just one, even in demon form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally she gets it.\u201d Aggie smiled and stood. \u201cA stab through the heart will do it too, but that can be tough. They don\u2019t always have one where you\u2019d expect it. And sometimes they have more than one, to go along with the head thing. Maybe Ian\u2019s machine will help you find this chick\u2019s thumper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. I\u2019ll have to mention it to him.\u201d It was great to have hope, maybe a strategy to get rid of Alesa. But as long as she was pregnant...</p><p>Aggie stretched and her towel slipped to reveal one perfect breast. \u201cOops. I\u2019d better get dressed now. Ian and I are going out after he gets through with your little problem.\u201d She wiggled her fingers and headed for the door then stopped and turned. \u201cWatch.\u201d Suddenly her hair was dry, a golden tumble down her back, and she had on a stunning red dress, cut to show her curves. Her elegant designer shoes made my mouth water. As usual everything was expensive and fit her perfectly. \u201cSiren magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice. So you sat around here naked just to toy with us.\u201d I glanced at Rafe. It hadn\u2019t been me she\u2019d been playing with.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I get my fun where I can.\u201d She grinned at Rafe, her hand on the doorknob. \u201cBy the way, I gave Ian that blood sample yesterday, Glory. And you know how I hate needles. So you owe me.\u201d She smiled and I shivered. \u201cSee ya tomorrow. Shoe shopping. I like to buy as well as make with magic. It\u2019s a girl thing. I\u2019m sure you understand, Glory.\u201d</p><p>Understand? A Siren? Never in a million years. But she was right, I owed her for that blood draw.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s sure a piece of work.\u201d Rafe slung his arm around my shoulders as soon as she disappeared inside. \u201cWhat\u2019s this about blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little experiment. I can\u2019t imagine I could possibly... Tell you later.\u201d I eased away from him. \u201cAlesa. She\u2019s the immediate problem. At least now we do know how to kill a demon, but we\u2019re obviously not going to do it. Not while she\u2019s carrying a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone would have such qualms.\u201d Rafe paced the terrace. \u201cGranddad\u2019s affair with a woman from the dark side was frowned on by both shifters and demons, especially when it had consequences. Apparently Lucifer didn\u2019t want the baby since he was only half demon. And when Granddad made the mistake of bringing home my father? Hell, some members of my own family were all for making sure \u2018tainted shifters\u2019 never survived to adulthood. I\u2019d have never been born if the purists had had their way.\u201d Rafe\u2019s voice was soft, but it was laced with a pain I\u2019d never heard from him before.</p><p>\u201cBut any child, raised in a loving home...\u201d I looked into his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I have to think. I\u2019ve never let my demon side dominate. And if Alesa has my child, I\u2019ll make sure the baby becomes a solid citizen, no matter what I have to do.\u201d Rafe ran his hand through his hair.</p><p>\u201cI know you will, Rafe.\u201d I hugged him, hoping it didn\u2019t come to that.</p><p>\u201cIan\u2019s ready for the ultrasound. Alesa wants Rafe in there. You can come too, Glory. As a witness, she says.\u201d Penny stood in the doorway. She had put on scrubs and looked very much like the doctor she hoped to become one day. \u201cThe physical exam just confirmed what we already knew\u2014that she\u2019s pregnant and a grade A bitch.\u201d Penny made a face then turned on her heel. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, but I wanted to shift out of there and avoid this whole thing. I had no desire to see whatever was growing inside the demon. But I followed Rafe into the house and we both trailed Penny down the hall and into a bedroom that had been outfitted like an examining room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere he is. My baby\u2019s daddy, the worthless sod.\u201d Alesa was gowned and draped so that only her stomach was exposed. Ian, who looked a little harried, stood next to her. A monitor was nearby and he was adjusting some knobs while he held a tool that he was apparently going to run across her tummy. Laurie had parked in a corner and she nodded as I walked into the room.</p><p>\u201cGive it a rest, Alesa. Lie still and do what the doctor says.\u201d Rafe sounded furious. I guess the stress was finally getting to be too much for him.</p><p>\u201cLook. I don\u2019t appreciate the attitude.\u201d Alesa turned big eyes to Ian. \u201cTell him, Doctor. Stress upsets the baby and can cause premature delivery. I read it on the Internet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no way of knowing what your normal vital signs should be, Alesa. Whether you\u2019re under stress or not. For all I know, you\u2019re getting off to this attention.\u201d Ian glanced at Rafe, then me. \u201cPenny and I have been trying to figure out how far along she is, as you requested. Maybe the ultrasound will give us a better idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you people listening to me?\u201d Alesa raised up on her elbows. Her eyes were red and we could feel the heat. \u201cI don\u2019t have to submit to this. I can get the hell out of here right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bolt and we\u2019ll know for a fact that this was all one of your cons. Yeah, do us a favor and take off.\u201d Rafe opened the hall door. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Alesa, afraid of what the machine will show? I know you\u2019re wearing a fa\u00e7ade right now. That human coating is pretty thin. Can\u2019t you put one around your baby? Or is it too ugly for us to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, just shut up.\u201d She sniffed and a dark tear trickled down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cRafe, take it easy.\u201d I moved to his side. \u201cLet\u2019s just do this and get it over with.\u201d Laurie had stepped closer and was obviously ready to jump in if Alesa tried anything toward me.</p> <p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the plan. Lie back, Alesa. This gel is cold but will let the machine pick up the image of what\u2019s inside you.\u201d Ian squirted the substance on her stomach, then began to slide what looked like a long-handled computer mouse over her skin.</p><p>\u201cWhat? There you go again. It\u2019s a baby.\u201d Alesa shuddered. \u201cThat is cold. Hurry this along. I hate all of you. Even hell wouldn\u2019t have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere it is.\u201d Penny adjusted the screen on the computer monitor. \u201cWe can take photos and print them out, you know. So you can have some to take home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwell. You can send out announcements, Alesa. We\u2019re having a... What the hell is that thing?\u201d Rafe leaned closer. \u201cTwo-headed hydra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think it\u2019s more than one baby.\u201d I glanced at Ian, who was very intent as he manipulated the mouse and watched the screen.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. Just as I suspected. You\u2019re carrying more than one child. Twins, Alesa.\u201d Ian frowned. \u201cPenny, turn the screen so that she can see.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. What was I thinking?\u201d Penny adjusted the screen so Alesa also had a view.</p><p>\u201cTwo babies?\u201d Alesa\u2019s voice wobbled. \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle. A rare and wonderful thing. Luc will be...\u201d She glanced around at us. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I want to hear what you were going to say. What about Lucifer? I thought he didn\u2019t want you to have a baby. That this had nothing to do with him.\u201d Rafe moved closer to the computer monitor and poked it with his finger. \u201cLook at that screen, demon. It\u2019s pretty murky in there, but I swear I see snouts, claws, demon markings. Not a sign of shifter whose babies look human in the womb or so I\u2019ve heard. Tell me the truth, Alesa. Are those babies mine or not?\u201d He grabbed her shoulders, pressing her down to the examining table. His own eyes were red now.</p><p>\u201cGet your hands off her!\u201d Suddenly Rafe flew through the air until he hit the wall and crumpled to the floor.</p><p>A glowing light filled the room with a pulsing heat. I heard a moan. Oh, that was me. Because I recognized that light and was instantly pulled back in time to a night that had almost been the end of me. I turned and gagged, grabbing an empty trash can as the last bottle of synthetic I\u2019d chugged came roaring up and out. Ian dropped his probe and Penny screeched and crouched behind him, holding on to his legs as a man materialized next to the examination table.</p><p>Rafe, never one to be intimidated, scrambled to his feet with a shout but was knocked back against the wall again. A dark whirlwind roared through the room, tossing papers and twisting wires. Equipment fell with a crash and Ian cursed as he dove for his precious ultrasound machine.</p><p>\u201cLuc! What are you doing here?\u201d Alesa reached for him and he took her hands. He speared Ian with a glance that sent him sliding across the floor to land in a heap next to Rafe. Penny crawled under a desk and cowered there, her arms over her head as she muttered prayers and asked God to save her.</p><p>\u201cSilence!\u201d Lucifer was as scary as the hell he came from. No one dared disobey him and Penny shut her mouth with a snap. Smart girl. I could see her shivering and tears leaking from her eyes, wide with terror.</p> <p>I\u2019d always thought Luc was the most beautiful man I\u2019d ever seen. Not that Lucifer was really a man. He was the Devil, made irresistible so he could tempt anyone over to the dark side. He used his looks just like he used his minions, his blond hair, turquoise eyes and perfect body tools of his trade. I\u2019d never seen him in what was probably his true form. Did he have a snout and scales like his demons? The stereotypical horns and a tail like a cartoon character, all in scarlet? If he did, he was careful to never let that side of himself show.</p><p>Tonight he wore a white silk shirt, open over his sculpted chest and close-fitting cream tailored trousers that ensured Penny and I noticed he was well-endowed behind the zipper. He swept his disdainful gaze over us then focused on Alesa. If he\u2019d been capable of it, I\u2019d say it was actually with some affection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had enough of this play of yours, Alesa. Come home. Have my children there, where you belong.\u201d He pulled her up to a sitting position. \u201cTwins. Not for millennia have there been twins born from one of my mates.\u201d He wiped away the gel with a cloth, then smoothed his hand over her stomach. \u201cGive me the photo, Doctor.\u201d He glanced from the computer screen to Ian. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Ian scrambled to his feet and righted the rolling cart with the keyboard on it. He started to say something, probably a complaint about the way Luc had knocked things over, but obviously thought better of it. Instead, he punched buttons and wiggled cords until a printer in the corner suddenly came to life. I sagged with relief and saw Ian do the same when he grabbed the printout and handed it to Luc.</p><p>\u201cHere. You can see\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done your part.\u201d Luc swept Ian aside with a nod and the doctor slammed against the wall again. I stayed absolutely still, trying not to call attention to myself.</p><p>\u201cIs it really...?\u201d Penny whispered.</p><p>\u201cLucifer. Yep.\u201d I managed to find my voice and dropped the trash can with a clang. Fury suddenly wiped away my nausea and probably my common sense. \u201cLucifer! You mean this was all one of your tricks, a setup just to make me miserable? Oh, and Rafe, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTricks? Like anything I do is so trivial.\u201d Lucifer raked me with a look that made me feel stripped and violated all over again. Oh, God. \u201cI didn\u2019t appreciate the way we parted the last time we met, Gloriana. But this game was all Alesa\u2019s doing. I certainly can\u2019t be bothered with \u2018tricks.\u2019 I indulged her out of fondness for her. You were not important enough to warrant my attention again.\u201d</p><p>My fury dissolved under his steady gaze and I wanted to cower under the desk with Penny. But then I saw Alesa grin as she adjusted her gown. Grin. Like all she\u2019d put us through had been a fun little diversion for her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can deny that you and Alesa were in on this together. I doubt she can go anywhere without your permission, especially in this condition.\u201d I glanced at Rafe, who was apparently stuck in stone, mute. \u201cWhy torture Rafe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe rejected her. Alesa has her pride.\u201d Lucifer ran a fond hand down her cheek. \u201cShe could not allow his rejection to go unpunished. It was amusing to watch him sweat, wasn\u2019t it, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure was.\u201d She took his hand and jumped off the table. We all got flashed as her gown opened in the back. \u201cBut this whole thing quit being fun about two days ago. I\u2019m more than ready to come home, Luc. Not to say this hasn\u2019t had its moments, but I missed you, lover.\u201d She put her arms around him and gave him a kiss that made me wish I was anywhere but here. Of course I\u2019d already been wishing that since the bad guy had arrived.</p><p>\u201cAlesa claimed you couldn\u2019t procreate, Lucifer.\u201d I just couldn\u2019t keep my big mouth shut. My reward was a blast of heat that knocked me back against the door.</p><p>\u201cAnd you believed that?\u201d Alesa laughed. \u201cHoney, this man is the stud who created ninety percent of the demons in existence. Good thing incest is a virtue down there. Am I right, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste your time talking to these inferior creatures, Alesa. I\u2019m not entirely happy with your behavior on this assignment. If you weren\u2019t carrying my children, I\u2019d be punishing you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, honey pot, I only\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it.\u201d With a touch of his hand, Luc made Alesa vanish. \u201cNow that she\u2019s gone, I have one more thing to say, then I\u2019m done with you. Gloriana, you did me a favor by taking out Honoria. That and this little trick that I allowed Alesa to play makes us even. I never want to have dealings with you again. Are we clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I want to deal with demons?\u201d I picked myself up and stalked over to stand across the gurney from Lucifer. Everyone else in the room had been turned into statues. I was the only one there, besides Lucifer, who could move. I\u2019d have felt better about that if I wasn\u2019t worried about the way he was staring at me. His eyes threw out heat that sizzled against my skin, reminding me that he was still pissed that I\u2019d basically rejected him the last time we\u2019d been alone together. I wondered if I\u2019d look like a boiled lobster if I lived through this. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWant, need, whatever, we seem to be crossing paths way too often.\u201d Luc finally quit staring and examined his nails. \u201cI, for one, am bored with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let Rafe off the hook for good. No more tricks, debts or any other calls from the dark side. Pretend that dab of demon in him doesn\u2019t exist. Because I swear, if you mess with him, you mess with me. What do you say? Do we have a deal?\u201d I didn\u2019t bother to hold out my hand. I wasn\u2019t ever shaking hands with him. I had a feeling he could suck out my soul on contact.</p><p>\u201cFine. I lost interest in him long ago. Why Alesa... Never mind. This is over. Be glad that I am letting you carry on with your so-called lives.\u201d He shimmered and was gone.</p> <p>Rafe was suddenly up and across the room to throw his arms around me. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you actually stood up to Lucifer and dictated terms, Glory. Are you nuts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuicidal maybe.\u201d I sighed and leaned against him. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a few cracked ribs. I\u2019ll heal.\u201d Rafe looked around. \u201cHe did a number on this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But I\u2019ve got a picture of two demons in the womb.\u201d Ian jumped to his feet and directed Penny as they straightened the equipment. Rafe and I gathered up papers and piled them on the gurney. Then Ian strode to the door.</p><p>\u201cVery brave of you facing Lucifer that way, Gloriana. Hope you\u2019re still feeling that adrenaline rush, because I have news for you and you may not like it.\u201d He pulled open a drawer and grabbed a fat file. \u201cCome into my office.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTest results?\u201d I glanced at Rafe, then Penny. \u201cPenny knows but I haven\u2019t told Rafe about this.\u201d That sick feeling was back in the pit of my stomach and I wanted Rafe, my best friend, to be there by my side when I heard the news.</p><p>\u201cTold me what?\u201d Rafe stared into my eyes, trying to read my mind. As if I\u2019d let him.</p><p>\u201cJust come with me. Ian can explain.\u201d I tugged him after the doctor.</p><p>Laurie stopped us out in the hallway. \u201cYou okay, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaurie! I\u2019m fine. How about you?\u201d Honestly? I\u2019d forgotten all about her. She\u2019d been a statue in the corner from Lucifer\u2019s first appearance.</p><p>\u201cSo much for my special skills. Obviously I\u2019m not worth shit when it comes to the head bad guy.\u201d She stuck her hands in her pockets. \u201cYou can fire me, wouldn\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I understand about Lucifer and his powers. At least he and Alesa are gone.\u201d Saying it out loud helped me actually believe it. \u201cI\u2019m almost finished working with Ian anyway. I won\u2019t fire you, but I may not need you after tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. Rafe\u2019s right. You were awesome going up against the Devil himself. I\u2019d like to know how you found the nerve.\u201d Laurie moved closer.</p><p>I shrugged. What could I say? Was I a walking dumb-blond joke risking my life like that? No. Hair color didn\u2019t define me and neither would whatever Ian had found out about my blood. I took a deep fortifying breath.</p><p>\u201cAdrenaline, a momentary lapse of judgment. Who knows? Right now I\u2019ve got to see Ian in his office about something personal. You can wait, but Rafe will be with me.\u201d I sighed, dreading it.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll camp here in the hall, just in case you need me. Jerry doesn\u2019t trust Ian and neither do I. He starts something you don\u2019t like, call me in.\u201d Laurie looked like she hoped that happened.</p><p>Rafe and I stepped into the office and shut the door. Ian dropped that fat folder on his desk.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want Valdez to hear this too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I looked around. \u201cPenny?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I have her cleaning up the ultrasound equipment and checking it for damage. It\u2019s a rental and goes back tomorrow. You can tell her later if you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d We settled into seats in front of Ian\u2019s desk. By the time Ian sat behind the beautiful antique piece, I wanted to scream. Every move the doctor made seemed in slow motion, deliberate and precise. I swear if he started straightening the pens on his blotter I was plunging one into his throat.</p><p>\u201cGloriana, you know I compared your blood sample to literally hundreds of paranormals and mortals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you told me that before, Ian.\u201d I heard the edge in my voice and told myself to take a chill pill. \u201cThank you. This is way beyond the call of duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it for myself as well. I needed to know why you had an adverse reaction to my drugs. In case this happened again with another patient.\u201d Ian smiled and pulled out a sheet of paper. \u201cThe last blood sample I took was a winner.\u201d He started to pass the paper across the desk then shook his head. \u201cI guess these numbers wouldn\u2019t mean anything to you, so I\u2019ll interpret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe, I didn\u2019t tell you this, but Ian claims I wasn\u2019t human before Jerry turned me vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re shitting me.\u201d Rafe was on his feet. \u201cWhat kind of scam are you pulling here, MacDonald?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo scam. I\u2019ve run hundreds of tests. Penny ran them too. Now I know what Gloriana was before she was turned. Found out just last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe, I believe him. Sit down and let him speak.\u201d I tugged on his hand until he sat again.</p><p>\u201cGlory, does Blade know what\u2019s been going down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and he\u2019s not believing it either. But I do, so just listen.\u201d</p><p>Ian cleared his throat and rustled his papers. \u201cCan I proceed now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpit it out, Ian. I can take it.\u201d I hoped I was wrong, but I was very afraid I knew what Ian was going to tell me. Rafe was practically vibrating with nerves and I put my hand on his knee.</p><p>\u201cYou were a Siren, Glory. You and Aggie were almost a perfect match.\u201d</p><p>Nine</p><p>\u201cA Siren? That\u2019s impossible.\u201d I jumped up and looked around. What for, I didn\u2019t know. Escape maybe. From the truth. Somewhere inside me this fact resonated, even though it made no sense whatsoever.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. Glory hates the water. Can\u2019t swim worth a damn.\u201d Rafe was up beside me now, keeping pace as I walked the perimeter of the room. I\u2019m sure I looked as wild-eyed as I felt.</p><p>\u201cWhoever did this to her obviously erased not only her memories but did a number on her previous abilities as well.\u201d Ian was standing, ever the Highland gentleman.</p><p>\u201cSit, Ian. I want you to run the test again. I just can\u2019t believe this is right.\u201d I stalked over to my chair and hit the seat hard as I sat again.</p><p>\u201cI ran it a dozen times and more. Took another sample from Aggie and, boy, did that cost me.\u201d Ian grinned ruefully. \u201cYou know she hates needles. Not sharing details, but let\u2019s just say the woman\u2019s insatiable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God.\u201d I put my head in my hands. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to be? A sex addict with a fish tail?\u201d Rafe\u2019s arm went around me, his warm breath near my ear.</p><p>\u201cGlory, there are worse things you know. Sirens are beautiful. Men adore them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I looked up and met his dark gaze. \u201cAnd follow a Siren\u2019s song to a watery grave. I\u2019ve heard the legends.\u201d I turned to Ian. \u201cTell me what you know about Sirens, Ian. I\u2019m sure you did an in-depth study once you figured out what you think I used to be.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and opened the folder again. \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. I interviewed Aggie, did some research online, though that was a dead end. The Internet is full of ridiculous nonsense and wild speculation. I doubt true scholars post their findings for the uneducated to read there.\u201d He pulled out a sheet of paper. \u201cAggie tells me her boss is Achelous, the Storm God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. I\u2019ve met him.\u201d I grabbed Rafe\u2019s leg. \u201cSee? I can\u2019t be a Siren. He would have said something when we were face-to-face. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould he, Glory?\u201d Rafe had been there when we\u2019d confronted Achelous. \u201cIf you escaped from him or he kicked you out of the club, he obviously wouldn\u2019t be all that thrilled with you.\u201d Rafe settled his hand on the back of my neck. \u201cI don\u2019t know what all this means, but he\u2019s a freakin\u2019 god. Who knows how they think? He scared the pee out of me. I remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Me too.\u201d I sighed. \u201cAchelous didn\u2019t let on but he must have recognized me.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cIf Ian\u2019s right, I\u2019m dead to the Storm God. I don\u2019t know what I did but it must have been so bad that he tossed me out of his harem.\u201d Harem. I\u2019d heard Aggie talk about serving that god. The thought made my stomach heave. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d</p><p>Ian gave an alarmed look at his expensive Oriental rug then jumped up and shoved a trash can between my legs. \u201cStay here. I\u2019ve got something for nausea. Be right back.\u201d He muttered something about how I\u2019d already defiled one of his trash cans then disappeared into the hall, shutting the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cPut your head between your knees. Breathe through your nose.\u201d Rafe still held on to me.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Put my head in the trash can?\u201d I heard hysteria in my voice and made an effort to shove it down along with the sick feeling in my stomach. \u201cI\u2019m okay. Unless I faint.\u201d I dropped the can to the floor and tried to process this news. What the hell did it mean? \u201cA Siren? Seriously? They\u2019re kind of like mermaids. You know, Rafe. We saw Aggie swim, morph into a thing with a fish tail on her bottom half.\u201d I looked down at my legs in black slacks, trying to imagine it and just couldn\u2019t. Amnesia? Or a trick? This time by Ian. I\u2019d heard Jerry\u2019s warnings about the MacDonalds for too many years not to be wary of them and their \u201cresults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this.\u201d I said it out loud again.</p><p>\u201cThere are worse things, Glory. Seriously. You could have demon blood.\u201d Rafe sounded bitter.</p><p>\u201cStop. This is my moment. Focus on me, Rafe.\u201d I knew how that sounded but really. I was sick of the whole demon issue. This was all about me, damn it. Rafe had known about his demon blood all his life. I\u2019d had about a minute to deal with this idea of a previous life sitting on a rock singing for sailors. So I could kill them. The very thought made me want to heave again. I held my hand over my mouth and breathed through my nose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Sorry. Sirens. Yeah, they lured sailors to their deaths. Can\u2019t quite see you doing that, Glory.\u201d Rafe picked up the paper Ian had left on his desk. \u201c\u2018Sexual beings, able to ensnare men with their powers. Irresistible to males who become helpless once they hear the Siren\u2019s call.\u2019 Okay, I\u2019m buying that one. You had me the first time you patted me on my furry head.\u201d He had the nerve to grin at me.</p><p>\u201cYou think this is funny?\u201d I was up again. Rafe had been shifted into a dog body when I\u2019d met him. I\u2019d even rubbed his tummy. Yeah, I just bet he\u2019d got off to that. I stomped around the room, avoiding his hands when he reached for me.</p><p>\u201cThis Siren deal explains everything. How I got Jerry in the first place. Why you won\u2019t forget me and move on. Hell, why Ray, a world-famous rock star, still makes passes at me even after I\u2019ve turned him down more than once. You\u2019ve got to know that\u2019s not his normal behavior with women.\u201d I stopped, blinked away stupid tears, and met Rafe\u2019s gaze. \u201cI\u2019m a damned Siren, Rafe. You guys are in thrall to me. You can\u2019t freakin\u2019 help yourselves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Glory. I\u2019m in thrall to nobody. I have free will. I can walk away at any time. So can Blade. Ray never even got a real chance at you. Still, I don\u2019t see him camped on your doorstep, begging for your favors, do you?\u201d Rafe tried to pull me into his arms but I knocked away his hands. I just couldn\u2019t be distracted right now or comforted. I had to figure this out.</p><p>\u201cGo back for a second. Can you? Can you really walk away, Rafe?\u201d I thought about how I used our friendship, how I leaned on him. Rafe deserved a life of his own. A love of his own. Not my crumbs. I knew I wasn\u2019t ever going to give him my whole heart. Or at least not that I could imagine anytime in the near future. \u201cThen let\u2019s test it. Go. Date other women. Screw your brains out. Have a relationship, a real relationship with another woman and forget me. I dare you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that going to prove? I love you, Glory. Would it be fair to another woman to use her to get my rocks off while I\u2019m still in love with you?\u201d Rafe\u2019s mouth was tight with pain. \u201cMy feelings for you won\u2019t go away just because you tell them to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet a clue. You\u2019re under a damned spell, Rafe.\u201d Tears filled my eyes and ran down my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ve ruined your life.\u201d I sobbed and fell into the chair again.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, you haven\u2019t. Let me be with you. We can have a life together. A great life. If anybody\u2019s in thrall, it\u2019s you. That damned Blade bit you, drained you and sired you. Made you his vampire and you\u2019ve been under his spell ever since.\u201d</p> <p>I raised my head at that. There was something to what Rafe said. The sire/fledgling bond was strong, some said unbreakable. I\u2019d never seriously tried to sever it. Oh, what was I thinking? Jerry had never given me a chance. He was so crazy about me, he\u2019d never let me go, even paying for a bodyguard when I\u2019d actually given independence a shot over the years. Under my spell? I took a shuddering breath.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it. Ian says there\u2019s something in my blood that is addictive to vampires. You can\u2019t imagine it, but he\u2019s even thinking he can make a drug out of it. Like the Energy Vampires have their Vampire Viagra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019ve convinced me this really is a scam. That doesn\u2019t make sense. You and Blade have taken breaks. We were in Las Vegas for almost five years when he didn\u2019t see you. Are you telling me he was able to just give up your \u2018addictive\u2019 blood for all that time?\u201d Rafe stomped over and grabbed the file. He glanced at it then threw it down in disgust. \u201cThis is a bunch of scientific mumbo jumbo. But it\u2019s bound to be a ploy to get to Blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Why would he bother using me? Ian has an army at his disposal. Besides, he swears the feud between their clans is old news.\u201d I did see Rafe\u2019s point. Jerry and I had taken breaks. Was he able to walk away from my blood because he was just that strong? Or could this be a lie and Clarity was all a scam?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re exhausted.\u201d Rafe smoothed my hair back from my forehead. \u201cLet me take you home. Your emotions are all over the place right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome. Yes.\u201d I felt strangely lethargic.</p> <p>Ian stepped into the room with a syringe. \u201cWill you let me give you a tranquilizer? It will also help your nausea. You can lie down in one of my spare bedrooms. You\u2019ve had a shock. And you probably should have a talk with Aggie later. To get more information. What do you say? A little nap now. Talk later? So you can process all this new information.\u201d Ian moved closer.</p><p>\u201cAre you nuts? You know what happens when I take your drugs.\u201d I waved him away. \u201cBut I do need to talk to Aggie.\u201d My stomach heaved again and I did take the bottle of synthetic Ian held out to me. \u201cI need to stay here, Rafe. I\u2019ll just lie down for a while. I\u2019m feeling a little off-kilter. Confrontations with Lucifer always leave me drained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I think you\u2019re actually in shock, Glory.\u201d Rafe watched me drink every drop in the bottle.</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s the doctor? But Valdez is actually spot on. Shock. You sure you won\u2019t let me...?\u201d Ian waved the syringe then put it on the desk. \u201cFine. Distrust me till the end. But you\u2019re welcome to a bedroom. Second room down the hall.\u201d He studied me. \u201cI think she\u2019s on the verge of passing out, Valdez. Carry her.\u201d</p><p>I did feel strange and didn\u2019t object when Rafe picked me up and lugged me down the hall. He laid me on a soft bed, peeled off my boots, then covered me with a blanket. I closed my eyes and let myself drift away. This wasn\u2019t my death sleep so I had dreams. Of fish and fins and boats with men screaming for me to kill them.</p><p>I jerked awake but was quickly sucked under again. To a beautiful sea. I lay in warm water, floated in the sun and played with dolphins and starfish. I chased sharks into caves where strange creatures lived in the darkest parts of the ocean that I knew I\u2019d never seen before. I rolled over on the bed and came up against a hard body. Warm arms held me tight. I inhaled and knew I was safe. I finally slept peacefully, dreamlessly.</p><p>\u201cYou say she\u2019s a Siren? That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Jerry\u2019s voice. Impossible. Here in Ian\u2019s house?</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. I can show you the scientific proof if you\u2019re not too dense to understand it.\u201d Ian obviously didn\u2019t care that he was throwing down a gauntlet.</p> <p>\u201cAye, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve managed to create evidence that seems to back up your claim, MacDonald. Now you\u2019ve drugged her again. What\u2019s to keep me from cutting out your heart right here and now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dozen guards surrounding you? And I didn\u2019t drug her. She\u2019s sleeping off the effects of the horrific night she\u2019s had.\u201d Ian\u2019s voice grated, the tone less of threat and more of amusement. It was bound to goad Jerry into doing something foolish. I struggled to wake up.</p><p>\u201cStop, both of you.\u201d I rolled toward the door and threw off a blanket as I sat up. Not drugged? I wondered. Could Ian have put something in that bottle of synthetic he\u2019d had so handy? The room spun and I wiped at my blurry eyes. There they were in the doorway, facing off. It was almost a surprise to see Ian and Jerry in jeans and knit shirts instead of plaid and battle gear.</p><p>\u201cGloriana! Thank God you\u2019re awake.\u201d Jerry pushed Ian aside to stride to the bed. \u201cHow are you feeling? You look like\u2014\u201d He obviously decided \u201chell\u201d wasn\u2019t the right word. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have.\u201d I took Jerry\u2019s hand and let him pull me out of bed. My legs felt a little rubbery but I managed to stay upright with his arm around me for support. I looked around for Rafe but saw no sign of him. I knew this was a busy night for him in the club, maybe he\u2019d gone to check on things. \u201cIan\u2019s been nothing but helpful. Quit trying to start something with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelpful? Filling your head with nonsense about Sirens?\u201d Jerry glared at Ian. \u201cYou have to know that\u2019s impossible. No one here knows you better than I do. You hate the water. I love you, but even you admit you can\u2019t sing worth a damn. I\u2019ve known you these four hundred years and more and seen no signs of a Siren in you. This entire idea is madness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously she was deprived of her Siren powers before you met her, Campbell. So of course you never heard her sing, saw her swim or kill with her call as Aggie can.\u201d Ian shrugged. \u201cGloriana needs to find out what happened. Why she seemed an ordinary mortal when you met her. I think the Storm God will have the answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want her to meet with him?\u201d Jerry pulled me into his arms and I went, a rag doll, flopping where he put me. I fought off the effects of what I was pretty sure Ian had slipped me. \u201cIf he is the one who did this to her, that could well be suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlow down, both of you. I want to talk to Aggie first. If I am a former Siren, I want to find out more about my, uh, profession.\u201d I sighed as Jerry\u2019s strength surrounded me and I absorbed it. I didn\u2019t know myself. Or what was real.</p><p>And God knew what would happen when Jerry snapped to the fact that he\u2019d never stood a chance with a Siren luring him to turn her vampire. Of course I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to be mortal. I might not remember my Siren days, but obviously I\u2019d have been desperate for the immortality a vampire had to offer. And Jerry had been in thrall to me for over four hundred years! Crazy. For a strong man like him, could he live with that knowledge?</p><p>But when I\u2019d tried to reason with Rafe, he hadn\u2019t been able to hear me. Was the spell I\u2019d cast so strong? Did either man really love me at all? I realized Ian had left and Jerry was staring down at me.</p><p>\u201cYou honestly think you could have been a Siren once?\u201d He brushed my hair back behind my ears and eased me down onto the bed again. Then he sat beside me. \u201cYou\u2019re certainly beautiful enough. And you had me bewitched from the moment I saw you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFirst, thank you. But I\u2019m not nearly as pretty as Aggie. Or her perfect size either. And second?\u201d I sniffled as tears filled my eyes. I hated all this crying but couldn\u2019t seem to dry up. \u201cDo you think that would make me proud? That I might have tricked you into loving me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t mean... Hell. I can\u2019t seem to say anything right lately. You are the love of my life. No matter what MacDonald claims, that will never change.\u201d He buried his face in my hair, his arms tightening around me. I felt him inhale, taking in my scent.</p><p>\u201cJerry.\u201d Tears spilled down my cheeks and clogged my throat. \u201cYour words are just fine.\u201d</p> <p>He raised his head and gazed into my eyes. \u201cBelieve me then. When I met you, all I saw was a full-blooded, delicious human woman with the kind of curves a man could lose himself in. A woman who stirred me like no other. Never forget that, Gloriana. No matter what nonsense MacDonald or that Siren fills your head with. And it wasn\u2019t your damned blood either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Jerry.\u201d I kissed him then, tasting him and loving him as much as I ever had. No matter how I\u2019d gotten him, I wanted to keep him. But I couldn\u2019t do it unfairly. Damn.</p><p>He pulled back, looking serious. \u201cYes, I had to have you. But I didn\u2019t want anyone else to have you either. Remember, Gloriana, that I selfishly made you mine. I killed you, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered when he ran his thumb over my jugular, making it clear that he meant every word he said. I reached for him, needing to taste him again as I did remember how it had been, the urgency between us. It was still and always there, the need that kept us together. His fangs scraped my tongue as we kissed, our blood mingling as my own pierced his lip. I could have kissed him forever, pouring my love for him into that simple joining of mouths, our bodies straining together.</p><p>Only when I heard the tapping of high heels coming down the hall\u2019s hardwood floor did I finally ease away from him.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Jeremiah. But I need some time to figure out what to do with this news. Please?\u201d I stroked his cheek. He hadn\u2019t shaved, obviously coming here as soon as Rafe or Laurie had called him. I was betting on Laurie.</p><p>\u201cJust keep in mind who told you this news. No matter what \u2018proof\u2019 MacDonald may have offered. And the Siren has not been a friend to you either. Will you?\u201d He caught up my hand and kissed the back of it.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d My mind whirled. Paranoia on Jerry\u2019s part? Or could I hope...? \u201cI want to hear what Aggie has to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you wish. I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d He smiled slightly as he stood and looked down at me. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t get into it with MacDonald. Laurie is standing guard between us. Valdez is still here too. They seem to think you want the doctor alive for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d I saw Aggie in the doorway. \u201cCome in. Jerry is just leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I heard. Yes, keep the doctor alive. I still have a few uses for him.\u201d She winked as Jerry strode from the room. \u201cIan told me the blood test showed we\u2019re a match. You were once a Siren.\u201d She pulled up a chair and sat, then just stared at me. \u201cHmm. Not sure I\u2019m buying it. Never saw one of the sisters with an ass like yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you always have to be such a bitch?\u201d I adjusted the pillows at my back as I got settled in the bed.</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s in the job description.\u201d Aggie laughed and tossed back her hair. Now that I really looked at it, I could see that the color was very similar to mine, though hers had more highlights. Guess she actually could go out in the sun. My few streaks were courtesy of a clever beautician when I had time and money to visit her.</p><p>\u201cTell me more about your job description. I know legend says you sing to lure sailors and their ships onto the rocks.\u201d I swallowed. \u201cTo their deaths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well. That was old-school. Too much technology today to let us get away with random shipwrecks. Achelous\u2014that\u2019s the Storm God, you know\u2014he\u2019s working on some new things. He can bring up the bad weather but we have to stick to certain areas for our luring. We use the Bermuda Triangle and a few other areas where ships and even planes disappear on a regular basis.\u201d She laughed. \u201cCan you believe aliens get the credit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I couldn\u2019t imagine how anyone could justify killing as a sport which is what this sounded like.</p><p>\u201cWhy kill people? Destroy ships and planes?\u201d Aggie shrugged. \u201cBeats me. Gods and goddesses are greedy and bloodthirsty. There are spoils, money, of course. I\u2019m just a worker bee, do what I\u2019m told. And there are perks.\u201d She tossed her hair again, obviously a habit with her. \u201cWe have a tremendous sex drive and you get lots of action before you, well, I can see you don\u2019t like the fact that we dispose of our lovers after we\u2019re done, but that\u2019s Achy\u2019s policy. They bite it with a smile on their faces when I\u2019m through with them.\u201d She actually looked proud of that.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You love \u2019em and lose \u2019em. Just like that?\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe how completely unemotional Aggie was about the whole thing.</p><p>\u201cHoney, you don\u2019t have a choice. I learned long ago just to keep my nose to the grindstone, so to speak. You don\u2019t follow the rules...\u201d She shuddered. \u201cWell, bad things happen. I\u2019ve heard that some Sirens have disappeared. Guess that\u2019s what Ian\u2019s sayin\u2019 happened to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you think maybe I didn\u2019t follow some of Achy\u2019s rules and he kicked me out of the ocean? Stripped me of my powers first, of course. Then I guess that\u2019s when Jerry found me.\u201d I tried to reconstruct my meeting with Jerry. \u201cBut I had memories of a family, a human family, and a first husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You know paranormals can plant stuff like that. Sirens get vacations on land from time to time. We\u2019re not allowed to knock off our lovers then, might get unwanted attention. So I once told a guy I got tired of that he\u2019d left a wife and five kids for me. He\u2019s probably still looking for them.\u201d Aggie laughed, then pulled a purse off her shoulder and extracted a nail file. \u201cMind control is a simple trick and I know you use it yourself when a mortal sees something he shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I\u2019d whammied plenty of mortals in my shop when they\u2019d seen fangs or overheard incriminating conversations between two paranormals. It was self-preservation. Now I was beginning to see it as a dirty trick.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019d love to know what you did to piss Achy off, Glory.\u201d Aggie began smoothing out her thumbnail. \u201cFor future reference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both.\u201d I reached out and grabbed her file. \u201cLook at me. Seriously. Do you really think it\u2019s possible I could be like you? A Siren? Forget blood tests. Look at other evidence.\u201d I made myself hold the eye contact when Aggie gave me her full attention. \u201cAlesa, that demon we just got rid of, taught me to turn people to stone. Like you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit?\u201d Aggie grinned. \u201cCool beans. And, yeah, that\u2019s one of our tricks. Not many paranormals can manage it.\u201d She jerked back the nail file. \u201cGive me your hand. I\u2019m going to deep dive into your psyche. It\u2019ll hurt but if you want to know more? It\u2019ll be worth it.\u201d</p><p>I put my hands behind my back. \u201cWait a minute. How bad will this hurt? How deep a dive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood questions.\u201d Aggie stuffed the file back into her bag. \u201cIt\u2019ll hurt like I was jerking out your fangs with a pair of pliers, but won\u2019t last long. And I\u2019m diving from head to toe. To see if there are some other clues there. I know Ian\u2019s all about the blood, \u2019cause he\u2019s a doctor and a vampire. But I\u2019m all about the powers and the memories. The statue thing is part of our repertoire, but there are a few other paranormals who have the same skill set, ya know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d I cautiously offered her one hand. I needed to know this. The pain thing was a worry, but I was a badass vampire, I could take it. \u201cYou promise you\u2019re not going to just hurt me for kicks and then refuse to tell me anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, you may be a sister Siren after all, Glory. You\u2019re seeming smarter all the time.\u201d Aggie popped me on the shoulder. \u201cLove doing stuff like that\u2014playing tricks, fooling the ignorant.\u201d She smiled as if remembering some of her better ones. \u201cBut this will get us good info. We both need it and you\u2019ll be awake, able to see what I see. I can pick up any memories Achy didn\u2019t sandblast right out of you. See if you truly were a Siren once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll just read me? Won\u2019t try to make me do your bidding?\u201d I didn\u2019t exactly trust Aggie. We\u2019d had a serious run-in not all that long ago.</p><p>\u201cHey. Ian says your blood is Siren blood. So I\u2019m taking his word for it until proven otherwise. The sisters stick together.\u201d She leaned in to whisper. \u201cEven against Achy when he\u2019s in one of his moods.\u201d She sat up and held out her hand. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d I swallowed, not a little scared.</p><p>\u201cThen lay your hand in mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s do it.\u201d I put my palm on hers and she gripped it. Oh, yeah, there was pain all right. It shot up my arm and seemed to take a bullet train to the top of my skull where it did a three-sixty about five times before starting a journey through the rest of my body. Among the jolts of searing agony, I saw stars, rain, some people falling to their knees and a few statues. I also saw the ocean, so beautiful and deadly.</p><p>I gasped for air, drowning in that sea when the pain hit my lungs. I bent over, unable to breathe. Stupid since I didn\u2019t need... Forget logic. I craved air and knew what it was like to die in that moment. Aggie held on to my hand, refusing to let go when I desperately tried to jerk free.</p><p>The torture continued down through my middle and I retched, clutching my stomach, my head on my knees. The room went dark and I heard men scream and beg for mercy. Boats broke apart and a body washed overboard in the roiling waters. The wind blew and waves crashed upon the rocks where I sat proudly, head back and naked. I was on the pinnacle, singing and crying out for the men to come to me. I would save them and give them pleasure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then the pain rolled on, lower. I wanted these men inside me, laughing as I made love to them. I held them until they drove into me, their screams as they used their last breath pushing us both to the ultimate fulfillment. Then I threw their spent bodies into the surf, jerking yet another sailor into place. Satisfaction. Why could I never be satisfied?</p><p>I shrieked as the pain ripped downward, toward my toes. Only there were no toes, just beautiful fins that gleamed with iridescent green and turquoise scales. I raced through the water to the castle beneath the sea where my lord waited. He would be proud of me, want my tally of this night\u2019s work.</p><p>I lay with my head on his feet, panting as his displeasure roared over my head. Not enough. Never enough. I had no passion for the work. No skill at the taking. I\u2019d failed, my kills weren\u2019t true and the men lived. I was unworthy, a wretched creature who could not serve this god with any honor.</p> <p>I kept my eyes closed as a hand stroked my hair. I heard the murmur of soothing words when the pain finally vanished, leaving a blessed calm and... emptiness. Slowly I came back to the world. This world. Where I sat across from a true Siren. One who did the job and reveled in it. Who killed and didn\u2019t sob later for the lost souls she\u2019d taken.</p><p>\u201cSister.\u201d Aggie paused with her hand on my head. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d I shoved back from her. \u201cI guess I got what I deserved. I was a disgrace. The Storm God threw me away. I couldn\u2019t serve him.\u201d I wiped away my tears. Why had I been crying? Surely not because I hadn\u2019t had the killer instinct. I had never wanted it. The fact that I had once done Achelous\u2019s bidding sickened me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard stories about lost sisters, Gloriana. Yes, I remember now. Your name. It is written in the archives. I can\u2019t believe he let you keep it.\u201d Aggie\u2019s face was wet with her own tears. She shook her head, blinked her sea green eyes, then firmed her lips. \u201cWell, that was quite a trip down your memory lane. No doubt about it. You were an epic fail as a Siren. You\u2019re lucky Achy didn\u2019t fry you with a lightning bolt instead of letting you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what else to say. Aggie obviously felt sorry for me. But I was beginning to realize being kicked out of the Siren sisterhood was actually a pretty good thing. Couldn\u2019t be a stone-cold killer? I was so out of there.</p> <p>Aggie pulled out her compact. \u201cLook at me. I\u2019m a mess and I have a date with Ian later.\u201d She reapplied her lipstick. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to tell Achy about this, you know. Of course he saw you not too long ago, didn\u2019t he? Wily bastard. Never said a word. No wonder he stuck me here in Austin. Bet he wanted to check up on you.\u201d She arched a brow and looked over at me. \u201cThink he\u2019s having second thoughts? Might want you back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, don\u2019t even go there.\u201d I jumped up, then fell back onto the bed. I felt reamed out, weak. The pain tour had done me in. Of course the Storm God didn\u2019t have designs on me. He\u2019d seen me and let me go. If he wanted me back I\u2019d be floating in an Austin lake right now with a rock for a bed. I dismissed the idea. Simply couldn\u2019t wrap my brain around it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Coincidence.\u201d She laughed like she knew something I didn\u2019t and went back to fixing her face.</p><p>I let it go, something else on my mind. \u201cWhat powers did you see, Aggie? I was so caught up in the k-killing, I didn\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question. Well, there are a few things I can teach you. Amazing that Achy left you anything to work with. But the very fact that he let you keep your name is proof that he had a soft spot for you. Either that or he\u2019s slipping. And, girlfriend, that man just doesn\u2019t slip.\u201d Aggie paused with her lipstick in her hand. \u201cPowers. The statue thing, of course, you\u2019ve got that. And I\u2019ll bet you can read minds through blocks when dealing with vampires, shifters, the lesser beings. Try it. You\u2019ll love it.\u201d Aggie pulled out lip liner. \u201cCan\u2019t read mine, of course, so don\u2019t even try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Try with others, I mean.\u201d I fell back on the pillows, still horrified that I\u2019d been like Aggie. She just sat there, calmly touching up her makeup after watching what amounted to a video of me doing the Siren thing like it was nothing. Yeah, another day at the beach. Literally. Swim out, kill a few sailors after some slamming sex. Business as usual. I wondered if I dared ask for one of Ian\u2019s tranquilizers. Oblivion looked really good right now.</p> <p>Aggie smiled as she put away her beauty tools. \u201cNo wonder you look shell-shocked and strangely flushed. Ian said you faced off with Lucifer tonight too. Not bad, sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lucky he let me get away with it.\u201d I put my hands to my cheeks. They did feel hot. Probably caused by that weird trip Aggie had done or maybe still singed from Luc\u2019s blast of heat in my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, hon, that Achy did a number on anything to do with water and you.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine my life without being able to swim in the sea. For a Siren, that\u2019s worse than death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, until tonight I didn\u2019t remember it was ever important to me. I avoided anything deeper than a Jacuzzi tub.\u201d I pulled the covers up to my chin when Aggie stood and walked to the door. \u201cTell the men I\u2019m resting, will you? I need to think. I really don\u2019t want to deal with any of them now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll tell them. But I doubt they\u2019ll listen to me. If your Jerry or Rafe heard those screams they\u2019re probably already crowded around the door. I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t burst in here. Ian\u2019s guards probably kept them out.\u201d Aggie stared at me for a long sixty seconds. \u201cA Siren. Un-freakin\u2019-believable. Wait till we tell Flo tomorrow night. She\u2019s going to go nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t tell her.\u201d I was across the room in an instant, even though it left me with a bad case of the shakes. \u201cShe\u2019s leaving for Paris at the end of the week. Let her take off in blissful ignorance. I\u2019ll tell her when she gets back.\u201d</p><p>Aggie narrowed her gaze. \u201cWhy? You ashamed of your Siren heritage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how I feel or what I believe. But I do know I don\u2019t want to deal with Flo\u2019s reaction to the news right now.\u201d I put my hand on Aggie\u2019s arm. She was dressed for her date in a winter white sweater and bronze leather pants. Her leather heels were cute but not quite right for the outfit or the season. \u201cYou need new suede pumps. Right?\u201d</p> <p>Aggie looked down and frowned. \u201cMaybe. Well, yes. These really aren\u2019t working, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get Flo stirred up about the Siren thing and we can kiss shoe shopping good-bye.\u201d For myself, I couldn\u2019t imagine dredging up any shopping enthusiasm. Or even crawling out of bed anytime soon. I was already feeling wobbly again. I staggered back to bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Tell her later.\u201d Aggie grinned. \u201cShoes are a Siren weakness. Because in the old days we so rarely got to walk on land. Thank God times have changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, it\u2019s okay for you to say \u2018God\u2019 like that?\u201d I sank down on the bed again. There was so much I didn\u2019t know about Sirens. Not sure why I bothered to ask this question. With their history, there was no way a true follower of the Storm God had a Heavenly future. The thought made my stomach turn.</p><p>\u201cSure. Thank God, the Storm God, whoever.\u201d Aggie rolled her eyes. \u201cLighten up, Gloriana. You are way too serious. Sirens are immortal. We don\u2019t worry about Heaven or hell. Lucky for you, you\u2019re a vampire now so you\u2019ve got the immortality thing covered again. Otherwise, you\u2019d be dust.\u201d She tapped her perfect chin. \u201cWhen did you meet your vampire?\u201d</p><p>\u201c1604.\u201d I fell back on the bed, thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cYep. You are one lucky gal. If your guy hadn\u2019t sunk his fangs into you back then, you\u2019d be long gone, sister. I\u2019m sure Achy never wanted you to live forever and he was really surprised to see you were still around when he did run into you.\u201d Aggie stopped in the doorway. \u201cBy the way. That memory thing didn\u2019t have to hurt. Call it payback for you and Flo ignoring me since the wedding.\u201d She tossed her hair. \u201cHope you learned your lesson. I\u2019m going for cute brown suede pumps tomorrow night. See ya.\u201d She took off.</p><p>\u201cBitch!\u201d But forget her and her evil tricks. Oh, yes. Achelous and I had met before and not that long ago. Yet he\u2019d said nothing. Had he arranged for me to become immortal or had that been a happy accident? And, if he really hated me, why hadn\u2019t he acknowledged me when we\u2019d met? Dread built up inside me so strong that I wanted to run somewhere where there was no water whatsoever. A desert maybe. West Texas was supposed to have vast stretches of open range with little water. I could be there in a few hours.</p><p>I heard a commotion at the door and figured Jerry and Rafe were thrashing out who was going to get to see me first. I heard Aggie tell them to chill and settled back just as my phone chimed that I had a text. I looked around and saw my purse on the floor next to the bed. When I read the text, I realized it had been too much to hope that Alesa could have just vanished down to hell without a final word.</p><p>Left gift 4 U N $ at apt A.</p><p>I sent a quick text to Penny to meet me outside, then slipped out through the window. Of course I ran into one of Ian\u2019s guards, but I just smiled and waved when Penny came running to meet me.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? Your text sounded urgent.\u201d She still had on her lab coat.</p><p>\u201cAlesa left us a little present at the apartment. I don\u2019t know about you, but I figure it can\u2019t be a good thing.\u201d The ground seemed to shift under me, but I sucked it up and kept going. I had to do this. I couldn\u2019t give in to weakness.</p><p>Penny grabbed my arm. \u201cGod, no. She mentioned me specifically?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you translate into a dollar sign.\u201d I dragged Penny around the house toward her car.</p><p>\u201cOf course. She never called me by my correct name.\u201d She dug her car keys out of her pocket. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d She stopped next to one of the guards. \u201cIf Ian looks for us, tell him I took Glory home and we need some alone time. Got it?\u201d The guard just nodded as we climbed into Penny\u2019s beat up economy car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe we should have shifted. It would have been faster.\u201d She glanced at me as she drove through the hills from Ian\u2019s isolated place toward town.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have managed it.\u201d I rolled down the window and let the cool air hit my face. My cheeks were still hot. \u201cI think Ian put something in the bottle of synthetic he gave me. I\u2019m still shaky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything but you look like you\u2019ve been windburned or were too liberal with blush, which I know you wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Penny stopped at a red light. \u201cAnother weird side effect?\u201d I could tell she was itching for a notebook. \u201cIan shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNews flash, Penny. Your boss does what he pleases. In this case, he probably thought I needed the tranquilizer. But my Siren blood obviously doesn\u2019t react well to his stuff.\u201d I glanced down. \u201cGood news though. I think my stomach is finally going down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. So eventually the side effects do wear off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only hope.\u201d We were getting near Sixth Street. What had Alesa done to our apartment? Penny had moved out, yet the demon had included her in the surprise. I had a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach that I knew what or who was waiting for us upstairs as Penny parked in the alley and we sprinted for the stairs. The door to our place wasn\u2019t locked and we both stopped and did a gut check before I carefully shoved it open.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Staring at us from a seat on the couch was Penny\u2019s twin Jenny. She was frozen in place with a wild look in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cOh, tell me she didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Penny sank down on the couch next to her sister.</p><p>\u201cRead her mind, Pen. She\u2019s freaking out, sure you\u2019re going to bite her on the neck any minute.\u201d I headed to the kitchen for a fortifying bottle of synthetic I knew wasn\u2019t doped. I took my time opening it. When I got back to the living room I heard Penny telling her sister how sorry she was about all this.</p><p>\u201cThe first thing we\u2019ve got to figure out is if I can thaw her.\u201d I took a swallow then set the bottle on the kitchen table, out of the way in case I was successful and Jenny made a break for it. I was going to stop her, of course.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Jenny.\u201d I sat on her other side. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to fix it so you can move and talk again. But here\u2019s the deal: you can\u2019t scream or run out of here. You and Penny need to talk. And I\u2019m Penny\u2019s mentor in this so I\u2019ll be here too. To help her explain things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Did you read her mind then, Glory?\u201d Penny\u2019s eyes were tearing. \u201cShe hates me. I think I\u2019m going to have to just erase this whole night from her memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would probably be for the best.\u201d I took Jenny\u2019s hand. \u201cThaw first. Decisions later. Now no screaming, Jenny. Penny, lock the door and stand in front of it in case she bolts.\u201d I stared into the girl\u2019s eyes and thought hard about thawing her. To my relief she jerked her hand from mine and glared at me.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare think you\u2019re gonna erase my thoughts, you two blood suckers. That demon\u2014oh, Jesus save me!\u2014warned me you\u2019d try it. She said she\u2019d come right back up here and do terrible nasty hellish things if you did such a dirty trick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s not good.\u201d Penny abandoned her post at the door.</p><p>\u201cGet back!\u201d Jenny darted across the room when Penny reached for her. \u201cMy sister\u2019s a vampire! Oh, my blessed Lord. I can\u2019t believe it. Show me your fangs but stay waaay over there.\u201d</p><p>Penny sniffled but did produce a fang-filled grimace. \u201cSatisfied? You think I wanted to become one of these nightmares? It was the most horrifying night of my life.\u201d She wiped her eyes. \u201cI wanted to tell you, Jen. But look at how you\u2019re reacting.\u201d Penny glanced at me. \u201cYou were right, Glory. I was crazy to think she\u2019d get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet that you\u2019re an even bigger freak now than you\u2019ve always been?\u201d Jenny was shaking so badly she had to lean against the wall. \u201cHow did this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not important. It\u2019s done. I can\u2019t go back.\u201d Penny tried to approach her sister but Jenny squealed and tossed a book from the shelf at her.</p><p>\u201cStay away from me. I mean it.\u201d Jenny frantically searched for escape but quickly figured out we had the only avenue blocked.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t bite you. Ever.\u201d Penny held up her hands.</p> <p>\u201cPinky swear?\u201d Jenny started to hold out her little finger then seemed to think better of it.</p><p>\u201cJeez. Are we in third grade? Quit looking at me like that. I repeat: I won\u2019t bite you.\u201d Penny slouched over to the couch. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m a certified freak now. It was bad enough being a brainiac. Never having a date in high school that Daddy didn\u2019t pay for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that was just for prom and Daddy didn\u2019t exactly pay Cousin Jimmy, just offered to gas up his truck once a week until he graduated from vocational school.\u201d Jenny felt her way across the wall to a chair and collapsed into it. Then she jerked up the neckline of her sweater until it was at her lower lip. \u201cGlory, that d-d-demon said you were a real old vampire, hundreds of years old. Is that right?\u201d</p><p>I got my bottle of blood off the table and took a drink. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. So kind of Alesa to fill you in. And, quit worrying about your neck. This is a bottle of synthetic blood. I drink it instead of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Pen? Are you into the bottled stuff too? Or\u201d\u2014Jenny swallowed\u2014\u201cdraining people dry and leaving their dead bodies in alleys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit sounding like a grade B movie, Jen. I drink the bottled stuff or hit my boyfriend\u2019s vein during sex.\u201d Penny flushed. \u201cAt least as a vampire I don\u2019t have trouble getting dates. Trey\u2019s actually an ancient shape-shifter. He appreciates a woman with a full figure. And his blood is awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God in Heaven!\u201d Jenny shrank back in the chair. \u201cYou people are insane. That demon\u2014Jesus save me!\u2014she proved to me that she\u2019s real with some horrible tricks. So I know you\u2019re not lying, but Pen! This world, what you are...\u201d Suddenly Jenny\u2019s eyes rolled and she fainted dead away.</p><p>\u201cThat was fun.\u201d I stomped the hardwood floor. \u201cThanks a heap for the parting gift, Alesa.\u201d I glared at Penny. \u201cAnd did you have to brag about taking Trey\u2019s vein? That was the final straw, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t help it. She\u2019s a cheerleader. And all that in her sorority. This vampire thing is my one bragging right.\u201d Penny flushed then knelt in front of Jenny and patted her cheeks. \u201cWhat are we going to do, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a cool cloth for her cheeks. Why don\u2019t you move her to the couch?\u201d I finished off my synthetic then headed for the kitchen where I ran water over a dish towel. I carried it into the living room while I went through all the potential Jenny complications in my mind. I understood where Penny was coming from, and wasn\u2019t about to fuss at her again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming around. I know you don\u2019t want me to do it, but I have to make the offer.\u201d Penny gave me a hard look.</p><p>\u201cI get it, she\u2019s your twin. Now that she knows the truth about you, make it and see what she says.\u201d I settled into a chair to watch the show.</p><p>\u201cJenny...\u201d Penny wiped her sister\u2019s face with the cloth. \u201cWake up and talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jenny sat upright with a wild look on her face. I was familiar with it. It was the look of someone who expected to be taken down a pint any minute.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I promise you will never need to be scared of me. I won\u2019t drink from you. You smell delicious, of course\u201d\u2014Penny smiled and I wanted to pinch her for stirring the pot\u2014\u201cbut I just couldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d</p><p>Jenny had started murmuring the Lord\u2019s Prayer at that smell comment.</p><p>\u201cIf I have to shake you like a tambourine to get you to calm down and listen to your sister, I will.\u201d I said it quietly but Jenny got the message.</p><p>\u201cUh, okay. Talk.\u201d She looked from me to Penny.</p><p>\u201cVampires, like Glory and me, are immortal. We live forever unless some wise guy manages to stake us.\u201d Penny paused when Jenny\u2019s eyes darted around the room. \u201cLooking for a stake? Trust me, you couldn\u2019t do it. Not only aren\u2019t you strong enough to take me out, but\u201d\u2014Penny reached out and gripped Jenny\u2019s arm\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t think you really want to kill me, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-n-no.\u201d Jenny\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cBut this is bizarre.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I still wake up from my death sleep and think it can\u2019t be true.\u201d Penny shook her head. \u201cCan you believe it? I\u2019ll look like this forever. Nineteen. Exactly this size.\u201d Penny frowned down at her admittedly chubby figure. \u201cThat part\u2019s a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You can\u2019t diet or exercise to get rid of that roll?\u201d Jenny actually reached out and lifted Penny\u2019s jacket to snag the bulge at her waist. The immortality thing seemed to have gone right over her head.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ve invested in a lot of Spanx. Now hear me, Jen. You have a perfect figure. Are young and beautiful. If you want to stay like that forever... Well, I can arrange to have you turned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurned.\u201d Jenny snatched her hand back. \u201cVampire? May God have mercy on us both. You would do that? Condemn me to hell along with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow just a damned minute. Penny is a good person. The same good person she was before a deranged vampire made her a vamp against her will. She is not going to hell. Get that into your pretty, empty head, missy.\u201d I jumped to my feet and got in her face. I also let her see my impressive four-hundred-year-old fangs. That sight was enough to make her fall back into the corner of the couch, pale and shaking.</p><p>\u201cN-no offense, Glory. Seriously. I just thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. You judged us based on comic books and movies. You don\u2019t know who we really are.\u201d I sat back down. \u201cPenny, this is a bad idea. The council will never go for it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that. I could ask Damian first. Explain the circumstances. He has a sister in the program.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProgram?\u201d Jenny\u2019s voice went up three octaves. \u201cThis is a program?\u201d She shoved Penny away from her. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking. I haven\u2019t seen you during the day for months, have I, Pen? I bet you can\u2019t go out in the daylight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d Penny frowned as Jenny sat up.</p> <p>\u201cAnd our donut and coffee runs are history now. Can you even eat real food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo again. We drink blood, that\u2019s all. But we have good synthetics like Glory said. I can get you set up with that.\u201d</p><p>Jenny dug into her purse. \u201cI\u2019m thinking the movies aren\u2019t all a crock.\u201d She pulled out her compact then swept me with a disdainful glance. \u201cGlory, you fall onto your blush brush tonight? Obviously you people can\u2019t see yourselves in a mirror.\u201d She checked her reflection, wiped lipstick off her front tooth then passed it to Penny.</p><p>\u201cThat would be a no.\u201d Penny passed it back without pretending to glance at it.</p><p>\u201cAnd you expect me to buy into this?\u201d Jenny thrust the compact into her Dooney &amp; Bourke tote. \u201cYou\u2019re nuts. How would I go to cheer practice? Attend class? Organize the pledge breakfast? I could go on and on. Things you two wouldn\u2019t understand but are important to me.\u201d Jenny gave me a superior look. \u201cWhile I realize Glory knows some interesting people...\u201d She grabbed Penny\u2019s thigh, suddenly not so high and mighty. \u201cOh. My. God. Are you telling me Israel Caine is a vampire?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot telling you anything. I just happen to know him.\u201d I got up and sent Penny a mental message to let this go for tonight.</p><p>\u201cNow listen to me, Jenny. Penny made the offer. We get it. You\u2019re not interested. Fine. But you will not tell anyone else about your sister, vampires, any of it. Understand?\u201d I looked her in the eyes. \u201cIf you do there will be bad consequences. To you and your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family?\u201d Jenny turned to Penny. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t let them hurt Mom and Dad, would you?\u201d</p><p>Penny understood even if her sister didn\u2019t. \u201cOur survival depends on staying under the radar. I couldn\u2019t stop the vampire council if they decided you were a danger to vampires in Austin. They might come after you, or just start with Grammy and Grandpa. To make a statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God save us all. What have you gotten us into, Pen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny didn\u2019t get you into anything, Jenny. She was dragged kicking and screaming into this paranormal world but she\u2019s making the best of it. You really should be proud of how she\u2019s adapted after a major trauma. But you\u2019re too self-involved. Obviously.\u201d I gripped Jenny\u2019s elbow and got her to her feet. I could tell that she didn\u2019t like my hand on her. \u201cNow I bet you have to get back to the sorority house. And we crash at dawn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Jenny glanced at her watch. \u201cLook at the time. I don\u2019t know how long I sat there. And then that demon\u2014Lord above watch over me!\u2014told me you had moved out, Penny. You should have told me!\u201d She glared at her sister.</p><p>\u201cIt was recent. And you don\u2019t usually drop by.\u201d Penny kept apologizing until Jenny shook her head.</p><p>\u201cNever mind. I, uh, love you no matter what you are but I need some time. And my lips are sealed.\u201d She put up her hand and shook her head again when Penny tried to hug her.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d better be. Vampires are everywhere, Jenny. We will know if you let our secret slip. Believe me.\u201d I was aggravated that Jenny still wouldn\u2019t touch Penny when she so obviously needed reassurance.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I get it. I said I\u2019ll keep quiet. You tell that to your nasty council. No one needs to get hurt to make me keep my mouth shut.\u201d She grabbed her purse and made it to the door on wobbly heels.</p><p>\u201cJenny.\u201d Penny was tearing up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. About that demon. She really scared you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say. Look.\u201d Jenny held out her shaking hands and we could see that she\u2019d bitten her cuticles until they were red and bleeding. The smell of that blood made Penny and me sigh. \u201cYou know how I worked to break that habit. One bad night and I\u2019m ruined again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Best get home and put some cream on them then.\u201d Penny practically shoved her twin out the door. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p> <p>We looked at each other as soon as Jenny was out of sight. \u201cSynthetic.\u201d A trip to the fridge for both of us and then Penny had to hurry to Trey\u2019s before the sun caught her. I was ready to hit the sheets. It had been a long night.</p><p>First I looked in a mirror. Yep, Lucifer had taken away that gift. No surprise there. So I grabbed my computer monitor that had a webcam I used like a mirror. Ian\u2019s tranquilizer that he\u2019d obviously slipped into my synthetic had given me a case of ruddy cheeks that would have made a Highland sheepherder look pale. I wasted a few minutes rubbing in moisturizer I knew wouldn\u2019t help then fell into bed. I didn\u2019t want to think about what came next.</p><p>\u201cThere is no way in hell you\u2019re going to meet the Storm God without me beside you.\u201d Jerry had arrived soon after sunset and he figured I was recovered enough to get into this.</p><p>\u201cRelax, Jer. I\u2019m not eager to have a confrontation with the guy. If I do decide to have a face-to-face, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll want you there at my back.\u201d But did I really? Whatever we heard from Achelous was probably going to either break Jerry\u2019s heart, send him screaming into the night or make him want to kill someone. Hopefully that someone wouldn\u2019t be me. But if he decided to attack a god? I had to keep Jerry calm or he\u2019d end up a mere charred stain on the ground once the Storm God got through with him.</p><p>I might not have memories of our ancient history, but my recent showdown with his high and mightiness was a vivid and horrifically clear picture in my mind. Achelous loved to toss lightning bolts for one thing. My hair had been fried, my nerves sizzled by power surges and I hadn\u2019t been able to hear for a week after our thunderous encounter.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m in no hurry to see the Storm God again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. If Aggie is right, the man rejected you. You have no reason to think he\u2019d want to see you again.\u201d Jerry played with my hair which was now clean and untangled, thanks to a nice hot shower and shampoo.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to join me in that shower, but I\u2019d reminded him that Laurie still occupied my spare bedroom. She must have arrived some time after dawn. And, while my death sleep had cured any lasting effects of my meltdown other than rosy red cheeks, I couldn\u2019t deny I was more than a little depressed and not exactly in the mood for a wild romp in the bathtub.</p><p>\u201cI do have questions for Achelous but I wonder if I\u2019ll like the answers.\u201d I leaned against Jerry as he moved his finger down to trace the vein in my neck. Maybe I wasn\u2019t as depressed as I\u2019d thought. \u201cAnyway, I promised to go shoe shopping with Flo and Aggie tonight. I\u2019m not about to tell Florence any of this. Just that we got rid of Alesa.\u201d I heard a thump from Penny\u2019s old room. Laurie was packing her things after doing yet another cleansing ritual. I was all for whatever magic she performed. I couldn\u2019t seem to get the stench of demon out of my nostrils.</p><p>\u201cShoe shopping?\u201d Jerry dropped a kiss on top of my head. \u201cThat sounds refreshingly normal after the week you\u2019ve had. I say have at it. Buy some shoes on me.\u201d He dug for his wallet.</p><p>I stopped him before he could pull out a platinum card. Stupid maybe, but I wasn\u2019t accepting charity and I was determined to fight any Siren tendencies. One of those avaricious creatures would have gladly maxed out Jerry\u2019s card and come back for another one.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve got this. I\u2019m not really in the mood for an orgy of retail therapy anyway. I\u2019m planning to cut this outing short if I get the chance.\u201d I laughed when Jerry frowned, laid his hand on my forehead and peered into my eyes.</p><p>\u201cAre you ill? You look flushed. I swear if MacDonald slipped you one of his potions...\u201d</p><p>I was keeping that latest dose to myself. I was definitely piling on some concealer as soon as I could get to my makeup bag.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Jer. Now I need to get ready. Later. When we come back from the mall. Be here. You\u2019re paying Laurie off tonight, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, a nice severance package. I had no idea we\u2019d wrap things up so quickly.\u201d He released my hands and pulled me into his lap. \u201cWe will actually be alone here. Finally. I can chase you naked through the entire apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase? Am I supposed to run?\u201d I leaned forward and bit his ear, drawing blood and sucking it away greedily. Oh, yes, this was my man. I felt the hard length of his arousal pressing against my hip. To hell with shoe shopping. I\u2019d feign a headache. Send Flo and Aggie off together and...</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, you two.\u201d Laurie cleared her throat. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go.\u201d</p><p>I reluctantly gave her my attention. It was a shame I\u2019d never seen her tiger. I bet it was awesome. Then again, if she had to shift into that, we\u2019d be in a hell of a mess, wouldn\u2019t we? Of course she blocked her thoughts. I decided to test my powers and concentrated. Could I blast through that block? It felt like I was shoving against a rock wall. Powerful entity. And she\u2019d held her own against Alesa.</p><p>\u201cGive it up, Glory. I\u2019m more than I seem.\u201d She threw a hand up toward the ceiling and around her body. The air shimmered in an arc, encasing her in what looked like glittering crystal.</p><p>\u201cWow. Guess so.\u201d I blinked as I felt her punch through my own block to flip through my thoughts like they were yesterday\u2019s newspaper. Her grin said she\u2019d picked up on how I\u2019d just wiggled against Jerry\u2019s erection to torment him. \u201cHey, I was practicing. Aggie told me about a few of the powers I\u2019d had as a Siren. I\u2019m seeing what might be hanging around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPowers. Yeah, give them a try.\u201d Laurie nodded. \u201cYou can never have too many weapons. So if they\u2019re there, keep them sharp.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the hell are you two talking about?\u201d Jerry looked pained as he eased me off his lap. \u201cThat statue thing you did, Gloriana? I\u2019d say you have a fifty/fifty chance of getting that from either the demon or a Siren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt Alesa would have left Glory with anything more than a headache.\u201d Laurie nodded. \u201cFace it, Jerry. Glory\u2019s got a Siren thing going on.\u201d She didn\u2019t look particularly bothered by the idea. \u201cNow I need to head out. I got half my pay from Rafe. He said you\u2019d give me the rest, Jerry.\u201d Laurie had on her usual dull outfit of plain T-shirt and khakis. I never had gotten a chance to give her that makeover I\u2019d wanted to try. With her coloring she\u2019d look fabulous in green or a bronze silk.</p><p>\u201cAre you sticking around town for a while?\u201d Jerry pulled out his checkbook. I thought about looking at the number he was writing but spared myself the guilt. I knew it was probably more than I could ever afford.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m exploring a few options. I got word the council might have some work for me. Even Ian, who I despise, is short a bodyguard. I\u2019d have to be desperate to take that gig, though.\u201d Laurie smiled wryly. \u201cYou and I are on the same page about MacDonald, Jerry. Don\u2019t trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, Gloriana. Someone agrees with me.\u201d Jerry ripped out the check. \u201cI have instincts about people.\u201d</p><p>I decided to ignore the Ian bashing. \u201cMy friend Israel Caine might need someone else to work for him. He keeps guards around because of rabid fans. Let me give him a call for you, Laurie.\u201d I was back to thinking about shopping. Might as well get it over with and the women were set to be here soon anyway.</p><p>\u201cThe rock star? I could go for that.\u201d Laurie grinned. \u201cYeah, hook me up.\u201d She reached out and took the check Jerry handed her then shook his hand. \u201cThanks. Nice doing business with you. Let me know if you need me again, Jerry. Now I\u2019m getting a hotel room, then heading over to N-V for a drink. Locking horns with a demon always leaves me dry.\u201d She winked at me. \u201cYou need me, Glory, without involving this guy, you\u2019ve got my numbers. I left them by the phone next to your bed. Special rate for independent women. I figure we should stick together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, why didn\u2019t I get that special deal?\u201d Jerry glanced at what had to be the huge check he\u2019d just given her.</p> <p>\u201cYou hired me, not her. I set my own rates and can pick and choose who I work for. Sorry, but I believe you got your money\u2019s worth.\u201d Laurie picked up her duffel and slung the strap over her shoulder. Did she even own a purse?</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Gloriana told me how you had Alesa afraid to even sleep in the bedroom. Brilliant.\u201d Jerry walked her to the door and opened it. \u201cYou were worth every penny. You need a recommendation, use my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do. Thanks. Now see ya around. Call me about the Caine gig, Glory. Sounds like my kind of setup.\u201d Laurie stepped into the hall. \u201cI swear I still smell that demon\u2019s stench in your apartment. If you need another cleansing, call me about that too. No charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. It does still smell like burned cookies in here, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d I leaned against the doorjamb not about to share that Alesa had paid an extra visit here last night to leave her \u201csurprise.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll dial Ray when I get back from the mall. And thanks for making me feel safe, Laurie. I didn\u2019t think anyone could handle Alesa, but you sure did. You can add my name to the recommendation list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let you down when Lucifer got there last night.\u201d Laurie shrugged. \u201cBut you stood up to him.\u201d She popped me on the arm. \u201cWay to go, Glo.\u201d She nodded to where Jerry had moved into the kitchen, pulled out his cell phone and was checking his messages. She lowered her voice. \u201cBlade\u2019s a stand-up guy, shelling out the bucks like that. You got a keeper there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you? You seeing anyone?\u201d I couldn\u2019t resist. She was heading to N-V, wasn\u2019t she?</p> <p>\u201cNot yet. But I\u2019m keeping my eyes open.\u201d She waved her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you.\u201d She sauntered off down the hall, suddenly putting a feminine hip thrust into her stride. Maybe Rafe would like her after all. And I had no business feeling jealous about it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to go home, make some calls. I need some figures that I\u2019ve got in my office there.\u201d Jerry pulled me against him.</p><p>\u201cGo. The girls will be here any minute.\u201d I turned in his arms and kissed him on the lips. \u201cI\u2019ll call you when I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d He patted me on the bottom and strode away.</p><p>I sighed and leaned against the closed door. I really didn\u2019t want to lose him but this knot of dread about what Achelous might say just wouldn\u2019t go away. It stayed with me even after Aggie and Flo arrived and we headed for the mall.</p><p>\u201cGlory, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Flo had just decided on her third pair of shoes and was making a salesclerk very happy. \u201cYou should be laughing and taking advantage of these great sales. You said that demon is gone for good. Isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s gone. Lucifer too. We are totally rid of all demons.\u201d I glanced at Aggie, who was in front of a mirror on the other side of the store, admiring her feet in a pair of chocolate brown suede pumps.</p><p>\u201cThen why the gloomy face?\u201d Flo glanced at Aggie. \u201cIs it her? She is irritating, but she does know her shoes. She\u2019s not so bad to shop with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Flo. I\u2019m just sad that you\u2019re leaving.\u201d I gave her a hug. \u201cWho will I have to hang out with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t have your business, you could come with us. It will be great fun. CiCi is coming, so are Freddy and Derek. We will shop till we drop in those great Paris boutiques that I love.\u201d Flo sighed. \u201cNow I am sad. Call me. We will share all the gossip on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I forced myself to try on a pair of boots. They fit, were on sale and the right color. I couldn\u2019t get excited about them but I decided to buy them anyway. \u201cI\u2019ll take these,\u201d I told the salesman when he approached.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now everyone has bought something. What say we head over to N-V for drinks to cap off the evening?\u201d Aggie had whipped out her gold card and handed it to the salesman.</p><p>\u201cPerfetto. I\u2019ll call Ricardo to meet us.\u201d Flo began to dig out her phone.</p><p>\u201cNo, just the girls.\u201d Aggie put her hand over Flo\u2019s. \u201cOr is that forbidden since you got married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You think I am controlled by my husband?\u201d Flo\u2019s dark eyes flashed.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. But maybe you\u2019ve lost your taste for a little adventure. Become one of those homebodies who likes to just stay in front of the TV in your jammies with the old man.\u201d</p><p>Aggie smiled as if she knew exactly what she was doing.</p><p>\u201cAggie, cool it. I\u2019m tired and Jerry\u2019s coming over later.\u201d I handed the salesman my own credit card when he came up to have Aggie and Flo sign their sales slips.</p><p>\u201cOh, so now you\u2019re also a dull stick-in-the-mud.\u201d Aggie pulled out a new shrug she\u2019d picked up at a little shop farther down the mall and ripped off the tags. It was a shiny gold Lurex knit and, when she slipped it on over her blue silk minidress, made her look ready to party.</p><p>\u201cWe are not dull sticks.\u201d Flo threw her card in her purse and the receipt at the startled salesman. \u201cWe go to N-V and without the men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlo, seriously. I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d I grabbed my card and signed the receipt, standing when I got my shopping bag.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell your bestie why you\u2019re not in your happy place? Why Glory the dancing fool can\u2019t work up the energy tonight?\u201d Aggie had a malicious smile that made me want to smack her.</p><p>\u201cShut the hell up, Aggie.\u201d I jerked her arm as I pulled her out into the mallway. \u201cFlo, I don\u2019t know why Aggie is trying to start something but I just want to go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s trying to push you to tell me something.\u201d Flo was right on my heels as I headed toward the exit to the parking lot. \u201cWhat is it, Glory? What has you so upset? You think I can\u2019t see that you\u2019re worried, mia amica? Why do you hide things from me and tell them to this, this sea creature?\u201d Flo\u2019s Italian gesture made Aggie hiss.</p><p>\u201cYou want to start something with me, little vampire?\u201d Aggie seemed to swell, growing about six inches taller as we hurried across the parking lot. The lights above us blew out with loud pops and plunged us into darkness.</p><p>\u201cAggie, stop it!\u201d I halted and faced her, grabbing her arm. \u201cLeave Flo out of this. What do you want from me? A night of dancing? A pledge to be your best friend while she\u2019s gone?\u201d I threw my hair back behind my shoulders in an imitation of the Siren and bared my fangs. I didn\u2019t care who saw me. That was what the whammy was for. \u201cDamn it, leave my friend out of your little games. You want to be my \u2018sister\u2019 then say so. We\u2019ll bond over Siren memories if that\u2019s what you want. But I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m ever going to love you like I do Flo here. She is kind and good-hearted, something you have no idea how to be.\u201d I shoved Aggie away from me.</p><p>\u201cGlory! Explain to me what is happening? Why are you and Aggie having this fight? What is she to you? Sister?\u201d Flo pushed between us when Aggie lunged for my throat with her nails. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d She glared at Aggie, who actually stopped in her tracks. \u201cStay here. Glory, behave! I have to make these mortals forget they saw your fangs. Now put them away. Please! Aggie, you want friends, put down your hands. Now.\u201d</p><p>I saw tears in Flo\u2019s eyes and quickly ordered my fangs up and out of the way. Aggie said a few words that consigned me to a watery grave after some inventive tortures but she did lower her claws. Yes, she was furious. Tough shit. She\u2019d started this and she\u2019d needed to hear the truth. It would be easy enough for her to read my thoughts anyway. I remembered how horribly she\u2019d treated Ray and me when we\u2019d first met her, constantly threatening to drown me and give Ray to a vindictive goddess. It gave me perspective. Sisters? No way in hell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eleven</p><p>\u201cGet in the car.\u201d I pointed to my convertible, hit the remote to unlock it and would have laughed at Aggie\u2019s expression if I wasn\u2019t so pissed. She hated my small car, especially since she\u2019d been crammed in the backseat. She\u2019d griped about it all the way to the mall. My tiny trunk barely held our packages as I tossed them inside none too gently. I\u2019d kept the top up since Flo hadn\u2019t wanted her hair windblown so even headroom was an issue that Aggie had complained about. Of course her knees were practically under her chin too as we\u2019d heard at least five times. Like I cared.</p><p>\u201cWatch who you\u2019re issuing orders to.\u201d Aggie nevertheless squeezed into the backseat again.</p> <p>\u201cI want to know what is going on between you two.\u201d Flo dropped into the passenger-side bucket seat then grabbed my arm before I could start the car. \u201cNow, Glory. Why is Aggie being so mean? What is this sister thing?\u201d</p><p>I leaned back. I really didn\u2019t want to get Flo involved, especially now when she was set to leave town. I turned to glare at Aggie. \u201cWhy did you start this? I thought we had an agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the Storm God knows all and sees all when it comes to one of his herd. He called me on the carpet today, while you were enjoying your peaceful death sleep. God, I hate vampires. No offense, Flo.\u201d Aggie showed her perfect white teeth in a mocking smile.</p><p>\u201cNo offense?\u201d Flo\u2019s gesture made it clear that she was certainly offended. \u201cYou insult me and Glory. But what is this about the Storm God?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, he called me in. It was a special time. He raked me over the coals for my cooperation with Ian. But now that the cat\u2019s out of the bag, so to speak, he wants to meet with his pretty kitty.\u201d She hissed again. \u201cNamely you, Gloriana.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGee, can you trot out any more clich\u00e9s?\u201d I took a steadying breath, ignoring Flo\u2019s gasp.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this? The Storm God? Glory? What is this cat thing? Are you in trouble with another god?\u201d Flo kept her grip on my arm until I looked pointedly to where her silver-painted nails were digging in and leaving marks.</p><p>\u201cTell her, Glory. Tell her how the blood test you took showed what you really were before you got kicked to the curb a few centuries ago. And, yeah, score another clich\u00e9 for moi. I love \u2019em.\u201d Aggie yawned. Like this was the most boring subject ever. \u201cAchy may decide to make the end of your relationship permanent this time. How sad. Say good-bye, Flo. By the time you get back from gay Paree, you may be in the market for a new best friend. I\u2019m available. I can overlook fangs when the girl has great taste and a fine wardrobe.\u201d This time Aggie\u2019s smile had an angelic quality. Give the girl an Oscar.</p><p>\u201cI could never be your friend, Siren. Every word out of your mouth is spiteful, mean. Look at the way you make Glory sad. She is shaking.\u201d Flo had her hand on my shoulder now. \u201cWhat does she mean, amica? Tell me, favore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan\u2019s blood test showed that I was a Siren before Jerry met me. The Storm God obviously made me mortal after he tossed me out of his harem.\u201d I sent Aggie a mental message that made her raise her perfect eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cYou want to say that to me again? In the parking lot where I can get at you, bitch?\u201d Aggie grabbed a hank of my hair and jerked, bringing tears to my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cStop it!\u201d Flo snatched a handful of Aggie\u2019s new sweater. \u201cLet go of Glory\u2019s hair or I rip a hole in this sweater too big to be repaired. It was expensive, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGang up on me, why don\u2019t you?\u201d Aggie released my hair while muttering ugly words that would have been at home on any cell block.</p><p>\u201cWhat time, Aggie? What time and where are we to meet the high and mighty Storm God?\u201d I grabbed Flo\u2019s hand when I saw that she wasn\u2019t through with Aggie. \u201cLet go, Flo. My car isn\u2019t the place for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah! Lucky for questa femmina that I have respect for fine leather.\u201d Flo released the sweater and faced front.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d My car was new and I wanted the upholstery to stay rip free. If those two got into it between the seats, I didn\u2019t want to think about the damage. As it was, I sent a mental message to my best friend thanking her again for the quick save. My scalp still felt like I\u2019d been dragged through the parking lot by my hair. \u201cAggie? Details?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMidnight. And you\u2019d better adjust your attitude, missy, before you see him or you won\u2019t last five seconds.\u201d Aggie was examining her sweater. \u201cWe go to the same terrace where you met him before. Behind the burned-out shell of Israel Caine\u2019s rental. The house was torn down and it\u2019s just a vacant lot now, surrounded by a stone fence. It\u2019s for sale and deserted. A good place for a showdown. Brace yourself. The meet will probably feature a thunderstorm, lightning bolts and, oh yeah, maybe a typhoon.\u201d Aggie smirked at Flo. \u201cBetter drop the little one off first. She won\u2019t be able to handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle anything for my best friend.\u201d Flo looked daggers at Aggie. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go, Glory. Ignore this sea cow and her handler.\u201d</p><p>Aggie laughed out loud. \u201cTake a look at your friend there, Flo. Achy made sure Glory is the cow. Check out her butt. Did you use Google yet, Glory?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDrop it, Aggie.\u201d I frowned. Of course I had. And gotten all kinds of weird sites, most claiming Sirens were half bird.</p><p>\u201cTell Flo what you found.\u201d Aggie leaned forward. \u201cIt\u2019s a crock, of course, but you look just like the pictures on the Net.\u201d Aggie chuckled and slapped me on the shoulder. \u201cBird butt. Isn\u2019t that just perfect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the hell up.\u201d I gave her a look that should have warned her off. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to get into this now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, Aggie. Calling her silly names isn\u2019t helping. And what does a bird have to do with a Siren anyway?\u201d Flo stared at Aggie until she settled into the backseat again. \u201cYou swim. I thought you turned into mermaids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like a Disney cartoon to you?\u201d Aggie\u2019s smile would make sharks flinch.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d Flo frowned, not happy to be kept in the dark about anything. Actually neither was I.</p><p>\u201cWe can be whatever we want. We do a lot of things in the water. What we shift into is up to us.\u201d Aggie obviously wasn\u2019t going to spill any details, not to Flo anyway. \u201cNow look. We have some time before we have to meet Achelous. Why not go to N-V, get a few drinks\u2014you guys can get that blood with alcohol there\u2014and then go with Glory to face the music? I\u2019ve got to show up anyway and maybe Glo would like her best friend along to help pick up the pieces afterward.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to scream, curse, maybe sob a little. Why tonight? When I was still trying to come to terms with this? Of course that was why. Gods always wanted the upper hand. Not that he thought I was a worthy opponent on any level.</p><p>\u201cI do have to go, Flo. I have questions that need answers and Achelous is the only one who has them. But, Flo, you shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, now Aggie is making some sense. Of course I would want to be with you if you have to face this Storm God.\u201d Flo squeezed my shoulder gently. \u201cWhat happens if she just doesn\u2019t show up, water witch?\u201d</p><p>Aggie\u2019s laugh this time made my skin crawl. \u201cIgnore a summons? Well, I sure wouldn\u2019t want Achy to come looking for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we go. And I could use a drink. But you really believe this, Glory? That you could have been una Sirena?\u201d She gestured at Aggie. \u201cYou are nothing like this one. Pah! Such a bitch! More like a slimy creature that would crawl out of a cesspool. Eh?\u201d</p><p>Aggie spat something in Italian and looked ready to reach between the seats again and continue their catfight.</p><p>\u201cStop. I can\u2019t take one more upset tonight. Not with the Storm God on the agenda later. I say bring on the blood with alcohol. And loud music to drown out my thoughts.\u201d Did I want to call Jerry to go with me to this midnight meet? No. He might get hurt. Rafe too. If I could ditch Flo, even better. I\u2019d get Aggie to help me with that even though the idea of asking her for anything made my hands tighten on the steering wheel.</p><p>\u201cWhatever you wish, amica. This is your night.\u201d Flo touched my hand. \u201cStart the car. Take us to N-V. Tell me more about the Storm God, Aggie. I have never met a man I couldn\u2019t wrap around my little finger. Right, Glory?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, hoping Flo wouldn\u2019t have a chance to try her skills on Achelous. Whatever womanly wiles Flo had, and she had plenty, I was sure Achy would be more than happy to let her practice them on him. Then he\u2019d destroy her. And if he did let her go after this night was over? What would her sojourn with the Storm God do to her marriage?</p><p>No, I wasn\u2019t about to let Flo anywhere near that monster. He\u2019d use her whether she wanted him or not. How did I know that? The bone-deep surety I felt made me want to stop the car and puke on the side of the road. My life before Jerry must have been a horror beyond my imagination.</p><p>I caught a glimpse of Aggie in my rearview mirror and realized I felt sorry for her. No wonder she had an edge. Who wouldn\u2019t, living at the beck and call of a sadistic monster with an insatiable sexual appetite? She caught my eye and I almost swerved into the oncoming lane at the hatred I saw there. Of course she despised me. I\u2019d escaped. She had no chance of it. Clearly I had to watch my back when I was around her. And this was the woman who\u2019d called me \u201csister\u201d?</p><p>I almost didn\u2019t recognize the first person I saw when we walked into Rafe\u2019s club. Laurie leaned against the bar talking to the hunky bartender. She wore a lime green satin tank top that showed off a surprisingly impressive cleavage and tight black skinny jeans with high platform heels that put her at six inches over six feet. Since the shifter serving up drinks was a big guy, her height didn\u2019t seem to bother him, especially as he had a nice view down her top when she leaned over to whisper something to him.</p><p>\u201cWell, look who\u2019s here. Your guard kitty.\u201d Aggie sauntered up next to Laurie. \u201cCan\u2019t believe you actually own decent clothes. I figured you spent your off days close to nature so you could enjoy some deer sushi\u201d\u2014she glanced down the bar at the mortals crowded nearby\u2014\u201cbetween shifts.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBuzz off.\u201d Laurie threw back a tequila shot then stepped away from her. \u201cGlory, haven\u2019t you got better things to do than hang out with tuna breath here? I met her at Ian\u2019s. He made sure I got the 411 on their sex life.\u201d She flicked Aggie with a glance that should have drawn blood. \u201cHe never did discriminate when he could get it cheap and easy.\u201d</p><p>I could see a bar fight brewing and figured Rafe wouldn\u2019t thank me for letting it happen. Risking my own life, I stepped between the two women.</p><p>\u201cCan we dial it down? I know you don\u2019t care who Ian\u2019s involved with now, Laurie. And you remember my friend Florence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh, Glory told me you handled Alesa like a charm. I will remember that if, God forbid, we have visitors of that sort again in the future.\u201d Flo smiled and nodded.</p><p>I signaled the bartender and ordered my favorite flavor of blood, with alcohol. I was glad to see that Laurie had taken my point and decided to ignore Aggie as she slipped Flo a business card. Networking. Why not? I wasn\u2019t so sure the Siren was on the same page. Then the bartender, obviously used to deflecting volatile situations, grabbed the Siren\u2019s attention with a question about her drink order. Aggie cast one more evil look at Laurie\u2019s back then decided to ignore her too.</p><p>Flo put in her own order. \u201cThis round is on me. I\u2019m avoiding the alcohol. We have a meeting later and I need my head clear. Glory? I think she wants oblivion.\u201d She leaned closer to Laurie. \u201cIf you are free at midnight, we could use you. I will pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Flo. I don\u2019t want to drag any more innocent bystanders into this or tap your bank account. And I\u2019ll go easy on the alcohol. I can\u2019t afford to be oblivious.\u201d Though it would be nice to be toasted during what was sure to come. As for Laurie? What in the heck could a were-tiger do against the Storm God anyway? He could make anyone into a statue with a glance.</p><p>\u201cStorm God?\u201d Laurie looked meaningfully at the nearby mortals. Of course she\u2019d read my thoughts and wasn\u2019t about to turn down a chance at a paying gig. \u201cThere somewhere we can meet privately? I might know a thing or two that could help you, Glory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGive me a freakin\u2019 break. What\u2019s a tiger gonna know about Achelous?\u201d Aggie had asked for a dirty martini and now gulped it down. She signaled for a refill. She obviously didn\u2019t care that we were surrounded by strangers who\u2019d begun to stare at us curiously.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a break room. Come on.\u201d I grabbed Aggie\u2019s arm. \u201cShut up. You really are determined to make me hurt you, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I hustled her toward the employee break room. Luckily the club was busy and there wasn\u2019t anyone inside. Laurie and Flo followed us in.</p><p>\u201cJust try it, Gloriana.\u201d Aggie jerked her arm out of my grasp as soon as we were inside with the door closed. \u201cWe are so going to settle this as soon as Achy is through with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I look forward to it.\u201d I had no idea how I\u2019d come out in a fight with Aggie, but suddenly itched to try to take her. My scalp still screamed where she\u2019d pulled my hair.</p><p>\u201cStop it! Glory, you need your energy for what\u2019s coming. Fighting with this creatura doesn\u2019t help. S\u00ed?\u201d Flo waited for my reluctant nod, then touched Laurie\u2019s arm. \u201cDo you know about Glory\u2019s news? That Ian discovered she used to be a Siren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Laurie shook her head. \u201cNasty business. Glory had to be carried out of Ian\u2019s office after hearing the test results.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, amica! I wish I had been there for you.\u201d Flo hugged me. \u201cOf course you would be horrified to think...\u201d She released me, her eyes awash with tears. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Flo.\u201d I was feeling pretty watery myself.</p><p>Laurie glanced at Aggie. \u201cDon\u2019t blame you for taking that hard. Sirens. Bitches of the deep. I sure wouldn\u2019t want any part of that pack of she-devils. But it\u2019s better than being related to Alesa, I have to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSwell. You put me one step above a demon from hell.\u201d Aggie actually worked up a tear. \u201cWhat\u2019s with you people? Sirens are not all bad. We cleared out a lot of the pirates that used to plague the ships in the Mediterranean. And our songs are beautiful. Some say Aphrodite was once one of us, you know. Men worship us. Will do anything for a Siren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen can be fools. I think we can all agree on that.\u201d Laurie looked around the room.</p><p>Even Flo nodded. \u201cS\u00ed. It is the brain in their pantaloni that does their thinking. It works to my advantage, I tell you. Has for centuries.\u201d Flo stayed solemn, like she was imparting the wisdom of the ages. And in a way she was. \u201cA smart woman learns early how to use a man\u2019s desperation to get under her skirts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s agree we can manipulate men with sex. But I doubt the Storm God is so vulnerable. After all, he has a stable of women he\u2019s kept corralled for thousands of years.\u201d I looked at Aggie. \u201cYou said he knows all and sees all. You think we need to worry that he might be tuned in to this conversation right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot likely. This is his usual playtime. He\u2019s out with a couple of the sisters having a conjugal visit.\u201d Aggie wrinkled her nose. \u201cAt least it wasn\u2019t my turn in the rotation. He likes us to pair up, two on one if you get my drift. Of course he gets into the mix too. I\u2019ve got plenty of libido but it\u2019s the same old same old, century after century. And it takes forever for him to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease.\u201d I held up my hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve answered the question. Now answer another one. Is there any way we can get the best of him? Make sure I come out of this alive?\u201d I tried to read her thoughts and hit a hard impenetrable wall. She stalled just long enough to drive me crazy, feigning boredom as she studied a minute hangnail. I wanted to grab her, throw her against the wall and pound her until she answered me. Finally, she glanced up and fake smiled.</p><p>\u201cSeriously? I figure you\u2019re golden, Gloriana.\u201d The way she drawled my name made it sound like an insult. \u201cIf Achy wanted you dead, honey, he\u2019d have done the deed centuries ago.\u201d Aggie\u2019s face went hard again. Jealousy. That was her emotion of choice now. \u201cBut maybe he\u2019s changed his mind. Does the Storm God have vulnerabilities? Beautiful women, of course. Charm him if he gets out his death ray. That\u2019s your best bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath ray?\u201d I sank down on the sofa where I knew employees sometimes napped. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what the sisters call it. It\u2019s when the big guy is so mad he shoots lightning out of his eyeballs. Scary as hell.\u201d Aggie shivered. \u201cYou really, really don\u2019t want him to go there.\u201d She smirked at Laurie. \u201cTiger, you have anything you can pull out of your furry ass that could beat that? Got to warn you, he\u2019ll see a bite or a scratch as foreplay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll just have to wait and see, now won\u2019t you?\u201d Laurie\u2019s growl meant business and certainly convinced me she might have a surprise or two left to show us. I sure hoped so. \u201cWhen\u2019s this meeting?\u201d Laurie glanced at her narrow platinum watch. Tonight everything about her was feminine. Even her earrings were delicate dangles and I swear she\u2019d used a curling iron on her tiger-striped hair. The Storm God would be all over her if she didn\u2019t have a way to shut him down.</p><p>\u201cMidnight.\u201d I studied the large clock on the wall above the door while my stomach hopscotched up to my throat. \u201cWe have two hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much prep time, but I may have a thought or two. Tell me the location and I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d She grabbed a pad off the employee dining table and wrote down the directions Aggie gave her.</p><p>Flo sidled up to me. \u201cIt\u2019s no use. I don\u2019t like this. We can charter a plane and be on our way to Paris before midnight. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTempting. But I can\u2019t afford\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI afford. For my best friend. Let this god throw his lightning bolts at Aggie. She needs a shot of electricity up her butt. I don\u2019t think she even wears panties. Slut. Trying to hurt you...\u201d</p><p>I swallowed a giggle at the fierce look on Flo\u2019s face. But the urge died quickly. I knew I couldn\u2019t run, as tempting as that sounded.</p><p>\u201cThanks, pal. That is the most amazing offer I\u2019ve had in my entire life. But I\u2019ve got to do this. Just in case... Hell, maybe Jerry\u2019s right and this is all a scam\u2014something Aggie and Ian cooked up together.\u201d</p><p>Flo grabbed me. \u201cIs it possible? To torture you like this. Oh, il mio dio! I will kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she\u2019s mine.\u201d I patted Flo\u2019s narrow back as I hugged her, tears making the room blur. When I looked up, Laurie had slipped out of the room and Aggie was giving us a disgusted stare.</p><p>\u201cAchy would get off to seeing you two in a clench like that. Try not to give in to the urge around him unless you think it will get you off his hit list.\u201d She pulled open the door. \u201cGreat band tonight. I\u2019m going out there and find a man to dance with. Come on, ladies. This may be Glory\u2019s farewell fling.\u201d She shook her hips to the music and disappeared into a group of students headed toward the dance floor.</p><p>\u201cOh, but I hate that creature.\u201d Flo sniffed and stepped away from me.</p><p>\u201cMe too. But we might as well go out and at least finish our drinks. I\u2019m hoping we get to this meeting and Achelous doesn\u2019t show. Then we\u2019ll have our answer\u2014I was never a Siren and this was all a hoax.\u201d I grabbed a tissue off the table and went to the mirror to repair my makeup. Except when I stared into the glass there was no Glory. Oops, forgot. I sighed as Flo came up behind me.</p><p>\u201cYour reflection is gone!\u201d Flo tried to look sad but failed. \u201cSorry, but that makes me feel better about you, Glory. Though I did notice you are heavy into the concealer tonight. Your cheeks look almost sunburned.\u201d She used my tissue to smooth under my eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Jerry, but I think Ian slipped me another drug, a tranquilizer, and the red cheeks are the result. You know I can\u2019t take something like a normal vamp could.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPoor Glory.\u201d Flo gave me a hug. \u201cIan shouldn\u2019t have done that. But obviously you were beside yourself. Who wouldn\u2019t need a tranquilizer after hearing such horrible news? But at least the demons are finally finished with you. Hah!\u201d She gestured down at the floor. \u201cStay in hell, burn forever, bastardo Lucifer, puttana Alesa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Flo, don\u2019t think I\u2019d taunt them if I were you. You never know when the demons might think we deserve one last torment.\u201d I thought about telling her the Jenny story, but tonight was already too full of angst to add another layer. Instead, I gave one last glance at the mirror, sighed, then headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cAck! You are right. Out of here, quick. I guess Rafael would object if I dragged one of his customers in here for a\u201d\u2014Flo showed the tips of her fangs\u2014\u201creal drink.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare.\u201d I held on to her arm. \u201cHe welcomes us here as long as we behave. Go finish your synthetic. Then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop! I read your mind.\u201d Flo gave me a stern look as she threw open the door. \u201cI know you think to make me stay out of this meeting but you can forget it, my friend. I am going with you. And that is that.\u201d She flounced down the hall and toward the bar.</p><p>\u201cWhat meeting is this?\u201d</p><p>I jumped and turned. \u201cRafe. Where did you come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStockroom.\u201d He juggled a case of premium vodka like it weighed nothing. Which it did to him. \u201cGood thing since I just heard something very interesting. What\u2019s going on, Glory? Who are you meeting?\u201d He pulled me back into the break room and set the case on the table.</p> <p>\u201cForget that. We went shoe shopping. Look at my new boots.\u201d I held out a foot.</p><p>\u201cGive it up. Those are your old boots. You wore them yesterday.\u201d Rafe pushed me down on the sofa. \u201cNow spit it out. You look guilty as hell. Where are you and Flo going? And did I see Aggie with you at the bar earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My sister Siren is a pain in the ass. I tried but I will never, positively never, bond with her. Sirens are evil, Rafe. Do you think I was like that before Achelous kicked me out of the sea? Or could it be possible Jerry\u2019s right and Ian and Aggie cooked this up between them and it\u2019s all a lie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose it\u2019s possible. Though Ian did have all those test results.\u201d Rafe studied me from head to toe. \u201cThen I look at you and can\u2019t imagine... You\u2019re right. You\u2019re nothing like Aggie. I used to think Blade was paranoid about MacDonald but maybe in this case he\u2019s right. It\u2019s easy enough to fake papers like those Ian showed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then there\u2019s other evidence. My reactions to Ian\u2019s drugs. And what I saw when I was with Aggie. The statue trick I can do.\u201d I took a shaky breath. \u201cI feel it\u2019s true. I know it. Here.\u201d I rested my hand between my breasts. My snug red V-neck sweater didn\u2019t leave much to the imagination and I saw Rafe take in the view where the knit clung to my nipples even through my industrial-strength bra. Yes, he was a man, proof positive that sex was always on the agenda no matter how serious the conversation. Well, I didn\u2019t care what he was staring at or why he reached for me to settle his hands on my shoulders. It was my message that was important here.</p><p>\u201cAggie showed me real memories of my time as a Siren. It was intense but I saw myself actually lure men onto the rocks. I made them, um, serve me and then I just cast them into the sea.\u201d I dropped my hand. \u201cIt was all at Achelous\u2019s bidding.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReal memories? You sure?\u201d His hands were warm as he drew me closer. \u201cI\u2019m sure Aggie could show you Gone with the Wind on the wide screen of your memory if she put her mind to it. Don\u2019t trust her, Glo. Things like that can be faked. And what\u2019s this about Achelous? Is that who you\u2019re meeting with? The Storm God?\u201d Rafe\u2019s hands bit into my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYes. Aggie says he wants to see me. It\u2019s a command performance.\u201d I sighed. \u201cWhich blows apart the conspiracy theory, doesn\u2019t it? If this is a MacDonald trick, then Achelous certainly wouldn\u2019t lower himself to play along, now would he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know what amuses these creeps. Look at what Lucifer did for Alesa.\u201d Rafe pulled me into his arms. \u201cYou can\u2019t go to this meeting. I remember that bastard. He\u2019s violent, unpredictable and throws around lightning bolts for fun. Those electrical charges can kill you where you stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it.\u201d I shuddered and leaned against him. \u201cBut I have to go, Rafe. If he shows up, I can ask...\u201d I glanced up at Rafe. \u201cOh, God. I can\u2019t stand the thought that I could have been one of those evil Sirens.\u201d</p><p>He brushed my hair back from my face. \u201cYou are nothing like Aggie. Hold that thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you are definitely prejudiced. Which I thank you for. But no matter what, I have to know. It\u2019s like I have amnesia. Wouldn\u2019t you want to know what was missing if you had a hole where your memories should be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Blade say about this meeting? Where is he?\u201d Rafe looked around. \u201cIn the men\u2019s room? He\u2019d better not be drinking his dinner from one of my customers in a bathroom stall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not here. He doesn\u2019t know about this. It just came up.\u201d I frowned. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not telling him, Rafe. If the Storm God does show, Jerry would end up getting himself killed trying to protect me. I won\u2019t have it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not your call, Glory. The man deserves to make that decision. After all the years he\u2019s got invested in you?\u201d Rafe grabbed my shoulders again. \u201cLook, you know how I feel about you and Blade being together, but I respect the man and what he\u2019s done for you. He\u2019s proved time and again that he\u2019ll do anything, anything to keep you safe. Under some kind of Siren\u2019s spell or not, that earns him the right to be there if you do confront Achelous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think the Storm God is going to do if I drag my lover in front of him? Just smile and say hello?\u201d I jerked away and was across the room in a flash. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rafe, but you\u2019re wrong about this. No man needs to be anywhere near this meeting if it happens.\u201d I took a steadying breath.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to meet him with just Aggie and Flo as backup? I\u2019m betting Florence didn\u2019t tell Richard about this either.\u201d Rafe waited for my answer, his stare making me look away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve begged Flo not to come.\u201d I grabbed a tissue and wiped away a stupid tear and saw concealer come with it. \u201cShe\u2019s insisting. She\u2019s such a good friend. Is even paying Laurie to show up. The tiger says she has some tricks that may help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, great. But you\u2019ve got another good friend standing right here. You know I\u2019d go to the mat for you too if you\u2019d let me.\u201d Rafe frowned when I shook my head and blew my nose.</p><p>\u201cDamned stubborn female. Will you at least kiss me good-bye? A real kiss, not some lame peck on the cheek. Hell, I have a feeling this might be the last time we\u2019ll be together.\u201d He pulled me into his arms. \u201cGlory, see reason. Don\u2019t do this.\u201d</p><p>I touched his cheek. \u201cWe need to say good-bye whether I survive this night or not and you know it.\u201d I wound my arms around his neck. I shouldn\u2019t have kissed him but I didn\u2019t have the heart to deny him. He took my mouth as if he wanted to drink in every bit of Glory while he had the chance. I did love Rafe. He would always be a special friend. But when his arms tightened and I felt his hunger move toward something primitive and wild, I pushed him away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Rafe, but thanks for listening.\u201d I gave him the best smile I could manufacture\u2014I knew it wasn\u2019t much\u2014and walked out of the room. I found Flo sitting on a bar stool, my untouched drink on a napkin next to her. I quickly drained it, the alcoholic kick welcome, and glanced at my watch. It would take a while to get to the isolated spot where Ray had lived before his house had burned to the ground. Arriving early wasn\u2019t bad strategy and maybe Laurie would be there with some good news.</p><p>\u201cLook at that puttana dancing. No grace or style.\u201d Flo nodded toward where Aggie flailed her arms and jerked her hips awkwardly to the music.</p><p>\u201cShe looks like Rafe did when he got Tasered out at the EV compound.\u201d My laugh was probably three parts hysteria, one part amusement. \u201cGuess Sirens aren\u2019t so great when they hit the dirt. Luckily, when I lost my swimming skills, I picked up some dry-land coordination. Come on, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d I stalked over and rescued Aggie\u2019s partner from further embarrassment. She grumbled until I warned her we might be late. Apparently the idea of keeping the Storm God waiting terrified her enough to get her hustling.</p><p>\u201cGlory, we could shape-shift out to this place. It would be quicker,\u201d Flo said as we forced Aggie into the backseat of my car again. \u201cWhat about you, fish girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit calling me that! And, no, while there are stupid myths that we were once half bird, I don\u2019t shift except to look human then back to my best form for swimming. Ow!\u201d Aggie bumped her head on the convertible top. \u201cPut the roof down on this stupid ridiculously tiny car. When we are in front of Achy, he\u2019ll probably work up a Cat 5 hurricane anyway. Trust me, your hair will never be the same. And Flo\u2019s hair started out looking like she styled it with a pitchfork.\u201d She kicked off her shoes and wedged her bare feet between the seats. \u201cYou at least need new hair spray, midget. I can give you the name of my brand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Like I take advice from a woman who wears starfish for a hair accessory.\u201d Flo shoved Aggie\u2019s feet away. \u201cEww. You have been dancing, sweating, and now you smell like rotting fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou Italian runt! Keep tossing the insults and I\u2019ll rip your frizzy hair from your head.\u201d Aggie crammed her feet into the back again. \u201cAnd, by the way, that\u2019s your best friend you\u2019re insulting too, you know. She used to be just like me, smell like me, dance like me. Screw the men and toss them into the sea to die like I do too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Aggie.\u201d My stomach rolled as I started the car. I didn\u2019t put it in gear yet, though. I pushed the button to lower the top then looked at Flo\u2019s pale face under the light from the streetlamp. \u201cYou okay, Flo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean... You are nothing like this creature.\u201d She hissed when Aggie reached through to adjust the rearview mirror so she could reapply her lipstick. \u201cI have only known the vampire Gloriana, my dear friend. The one who dances like an angel and has ancient vampire blood, not blood that reeks of seaweed and clams. You are nothing like her, Glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGag me. What next? A flurry of Facebook posts about how much you love your BFF? Or maybe you should tweet about it. Just spare me listening to this crap.\u201d Aggie tossed her lipstick into her purse. \u201cGet going. If we\u2019re late, we\u2019ll all be sorry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to get out, Flo? I wouldn\u2019t blame you. In fact, I hope you\u2019ll stay here. Aggie\u2019s aggravation is nothing compared to what the Storm God will pull out of his bag of tricks.\u201d I touched Flo\u2019s clenched fist. \u201cPlease. I don\u2019t want you to get hurt because of me.\u201d I gave Aggie a \u201cGo to hell\u201d look when she broke into \u201cO Solo Mio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We go. We fight. We win.\u201d She hit Aggie\u2019s hand when the Siren reached for the rearview mirror again. \u201cSit back. Now that the top is down, your smell will blow away in the wind. And know this, Aggie. My best friend is nothing like you. You should pay attention to how she treats people. You say you want friends of your own? Then watch her and learn.\u201d Flo opened her own purse and put on fresh lipstick by feel then handed the tube to me. \u201cThis is a new color, Firecracker. We will blow this god out of the water. He will worship at our feet. Eh?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cWait, honey. Maybe we should stop and pick up nuns\u2019 habits. Do you really want to charm a guy who has a harem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPah. I only know one way to deal with a man. I use it.\u201d She nodded at the lipstick. \u201cHe didn\u2019t kill you when he had the chance, amica. I say go with your best look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a point.\u201d I shook my head and applied the color with the expertise of years of practice. Leave it to Flo to make this into a battle she would fight with her best weapons. I turned and glanced at Aggie. I knew where all this hostility was coming from. I\u2019d had centuries of freedom, well away from Achelous\u2019s obviously abusive reign of terror. I could afford to cut the Siren some slack.</p> <p>\u201cRelax, Ag. I really don\u2019t want to be your enemy. You\u2019ve obviously had a tough life. If Achelous asks? I\u2019ll say you\u2019ve been singing his praises. Almost making me sorry I ever lost my spot on a rock.\u201d Of course if he reads my mind...</p><p>\u201cGlory, you can\u2019t say that. You might end up back in an ocean somewhere.\u201d Flo grabbed my hand before I could shift into drive.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. I\u2019ll speak for myself. But I appreciate the thought. Best to just let Achy do the talking. He will anyway.\u201d Aggie shuddered. \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you I\u2019m creeped out. Any meeting with Achy is a crapshoot. I have no idea how this could play out. So let\u2019s just get this over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. One way or another, I want some answers.\u201d But would I be able to live with them? And why did I have the feeling that getting out of this meeting alive wasn\u2019t exactly a sure thing? I put the car in gear and had to force my foot to hit the accelerator. When I had to stop at a red light, I looked up into a clear night sky. Not a sign that a storm was coming. If only I could count on that.</p><p>Twelve</p><p>Laurie was waiting for us when we walked onto the stone terrace that faced the lake. We\u2019d had to leave the car in the driveway and pick our way around the debris from the ruined house to the meeting place. It was a shame that a confrontation with a sicko vampire hunter had led to the house going up in flames. It had been a rental, fully insured, but the depressed real estate market had apparently kept the owner from rebuilding. Too bad. The view from the terrace was spectacular with stone steps leading down to a charred boat dock and one of Austin\u2019s many lakes gleaming in the moonlight.</p> <p>\u201cNo sign of him yet.\u201d Laurie hadn\u2019t changed out of her pretty outfit. I guess she figured looking good might come in handy as a weapon in this case or at least a distraction.</p><p>\u201cWe are a little early.\u201d Aggie stared out at the lake. \u201cI wonder if I have time for a swim.\u201d She laid her sweater on the stone wall and reached back as if she was about to unzip her blue silk dress.</p><p>\u201cSpare us.\u201d I grabbed her arm. \u201cWe really don\u2019t want to watch you strip down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d The booming voice was accompanied by a sizzle of lightning that popped and snapped nearby. A small bush went up in flames and we all froze. The man shimmering into view was tall, athletic and garbed in a Roman look, from the laurel wreath crowning his golden blond hair to the snow white toga draping his perfect body.</p><p>Aggie bowed before him, her forehead almost touching her knees. She gestured like the rest of us should do the same, but I decided that just wasn\u2019t happening. Flo and Laurie took their cues from me. I felt sick that apparently at least some of what Aggie had been telling me was true. And Ian\u2019s report. Siren blood. God. I had to struggle to keep from running screaming back to the car.</p><p>\u201cAchelous. You summoned me?\u201d At least I could still speak and actually move. I could shift the hell out of there. No, this had to be faced. Flo nervously fussed with the hem of her top and bit her lip, signs he\u2019d left her free too. Laurie eased nearer the low stone wall. He must not have thought much of my allies to allow them their mobility. Of course the god could make any of us statues on a whim.</p><p>\u201cYes, Gloriana. Aglaophonos informed me that you now know your true identity and that you have questions for me.\u201d Achelous\u2019s smile, a dazzling show of perfect white teeth, reminded me of Lucifer\u2019s. Both of them were cold, self-centered men who didn\u2019t have a lot of respect for women. \u201cI thought I was done with you centuries ago. But obviously somehow you managed to avoid the fate I intended. Amazing, really. Imagine my surprise when I saw you here the first time. And a blood sucker at that.\u201d He swept his gaze over me in a way that made me want to cover my breasts. \u201cCome closer, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not. I had a taste of your temper when we met here before. Down at the boat dock and not that long ago.\u201d I glanced at Aggie. \u201cCan she get up now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAglaophonos? Of course. Child? Quit prostrating yourself. Feeling guilty? You should. It is your carelessness that brought Gloriana and me together again. I thought myself well rid of her.\u201d Achelous waved his hand and wind whipped across the clearing, stirring up trash and bending tree branches.</p><p>\u201cI-I\u2019m sorry, sire. I didn\u2019t know that my blood\u2014\u201d Aggie blanched when he placed his hand on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou gave your blood to a vampire. Not just to test, but you let him drink from you, shared his bed. Is that not so?\u201d Thunder shook the stones under our feet as Achy glared at the Siren. Flo and I exchanged glances. So Ian drank from Aggie during their bed play. No surprise there.</p><p>\u201cIs it forbidden? Mentioned in the archives? I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Aggie\u2019s voice trembled and she sank to her knees. \u201cWhat is my punishment to be?\u201d You could tell that her choices were bad and worse.</p><p>\u201cGet up, out of my sight. I will think about it. It should be common sense that we don\u2019t share our blood with lesser beings.\u201d He thrust her away with his foot and she scurried off into the darkness. We heard a splash and I figured she\u2019d jumped into the lake, clothes and all.</p><p>\u201cDid you learn anything from that, Gloriana?\u201d Achelous approached me and I tried not to cringe when he stopped just inches away.</p><p>\u201cThat you think vampires are beneath you?\u201d I kept my chin up. \u201cI figure a god would of course hold himself above all others.\u201d I didn\u2019t share that I was having a hard time swallowing the idea that Aggie was better than me.</p><p>\u201cI see that you have pride in what you are now. Of course you do. You were always full of yourself. Thought you were above my rules.\u201d Achy flung out an arm and dark clouds roiled and roared. Okay, so I did cringe that time. The noise was horrific.</p><p>I noticed that Laurie had eased behind him and she wasn\u2019t a bit disturbed by the racket. If she went tiger, could she take him down? I knew there was no way that she\u2019d live through a move like that. I shook my head slightly when Achelous looked up to admire a particularly brilliant lightning display.</p><p>\u201cWhat rules? You erased my memories so I have no idea what I did to piss you off. Then apparently you tossed me out of the sea. Want to tell me about it? Why I lost my place in what Aggie calls a sisterhood?\u201d I wondered if I really wanted to know. I\u2019d obviously served this man once just as Aggie still did. Done things... I pressed my trembling hands to my queasy stomach. It had been a lucky escape from what I could tell.</p><p>\u201cHow old am I?\u201d The question popped out of me.</p><p>Achy laughed. \u201cInteresting question. And one only a woman would concern herself with when her life is hanging by a thread.\u201d He walked around me, examining me. \u201cYou served me for a little more than a millennia. Add the several odd centuries you\u2019ve been vampire to that and you have your age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re fourteen hundred years old!\u201d Flo gasped. \u201cGlory, you\u2019re even older than I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a lot, Flo.\u201d I let that fact whirl around in my mind for a moment. \u201cNow will you tell me exactly why you banished me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, I must solve a little problem.\u201d Achy suddenly disappeared, just vanished. I peered into the darkness surrounding us.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d he go?\u201d I figured Laurie would have the best idea.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s rounding up some visitors.\u201d She made a face. \u201cWe should have known they wouldn\u2019t stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Glory.\u201d Flo squeezed my arm and pointed to the edge of the clearing where the house had once stood. Sure enough Achelous was striding behind two men. You couldn\u2019t miss the procession because of the ring of lightning bolts forming bars around them, like a moving jail cell holding prisoners. Apparently Rafe and Jerry had decided to join the party. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d I started toward them.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it, Gloriana. You\u2019ll get the shock of your undead life. And you might not survive it.\u201d Jerry\u2019s voice was hard. \u201cHe\u2019s got us penned in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously we\u2019re not going to be able to do you much good. Sorry about that.\u201d Rafe glared at Achelous as he brought the men to a halt a few yards away from me.</p> <p>\u201cBehold your honor guard.\u201d The god laughed. \u201cStill have that power, don\u2019t you, Gloriana?\u201d The lightning disappeared but when Jerry reached for a knife he was turned to stone, Rafe too. Neither of them could move other than to blink their eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat power?\u201d I prayed Achelous didn\u2019t mean what I thought he meant. If he did, then my relationships with Jerry, with Rafe, hell, even with Ray were totally bogus.</p><p>\u201cYou know exactly what power, Gloriana. I made you mortal but it seems even I couldn\u2019t strip away your ability to draw men to you. A Siren is born to seduce. She can always get a man to worship her. You have the gift of enchantment, even at this very moment. Luckily, I\u2019m immune to it, though you are still a tempting armful if I ignore those disgusting fangs in your mouth.\u201d Achelous put his arm around me, something I didn\u2019t dare shrug away from.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d But I was very afraid Jerry and Rafe did. Though their faces were frozen, there was no mistaking the emotion blazing in their eyes. Fury. Impotent rage. At me? I didn\u2019t dare analyze it. I prayed it was at this bastard. The weight of his arm felt like a chain holding me and I could smell the ozone surrounding him like a nasty aftershave.</p><p>\u201cFace it, gentlemen. You would never have been able to resist this woman. She\u2019s still a Siren where it counts and lured you like dogs to a juicy steak.\u201d Achelous chuckled. \u201cAggie told me one of you actually played the panting dog for a while. How appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop it.\u201d I wanted to cover my ears. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do. Didn\u2019t you ever wonder, Gloriana, why your men were so steadfast? One of them for centuries!\u201d Achelous tugged on my hair. \u201cCouldn\u2019t get rid of your admirers, could you? But of course you didn\u2019t try. And you, gentlemen. You never could seem to forget her, could you? Especially you, vampire. How many hundreds of years have you danced to her tune?\u201d Achelous laughed again and swept his hand toward the sky, a clap of thunder shaking the terrace. \u201cMy Sirens know how to hold a man until the day he dies! Of course usually that\u2019s not but an hour after he knows her.\u201d Achelous stepped away from me. \u201cI have to say well done, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d I desperately blinked back tears even though he was saying exactly what I\u2019d been terrified was true. \u201cYou\u2019re just trying to ruin my life now. This doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat doesn\u2019t make sense is that you\u2019re still alive!\u201d Achelous stomped away from me, each step another thunderclap. \u201cZeus\u2019s toenails, but this infuriates me. How is it possible? I intended for you to have a short and mortal life. I planted memories of a disapproving family for you and watched you bewitch your first human, a poor actor. Oh, but you were ridiculous, learning to sew to help earn bread after he died.\u201d He glared at me. \u201cI assumed you would live out your ordinary little life in the gutter and that would be that. In a blink of an eye you would be gone forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t have an ordinary life. I met Jeremiah Campbell.\u201d I squeezed my hands together and begged Jerry with my eyes to forgive me.</p><p>\u201cA fucking vampire!\u201d Achelous threw up his hands and the clouds unleashed a torrent, dumping icy rain on us, everyone except him of course. There was no shelter anywhere and we had to just stand there and take it, the cold hard rain drenching us in seconds. \u201cConniving bitch. You persuaded him to make you immortal. You were supposed to die! I had no idea. Had quit watching you or\u2014\u201d He ground his teeth and sparks flew. \u201cHindsight.\u201d</p> <p>As quickly as the rain had started, it stopped. The clouds rolled away and the moon appeared, a brilliant white circle in the night sky. Stars twinkled above us in a breathtaking display.</p><p>\u201cGloriana didn\u2019t die because I wouldn\u2019t allow it.\u201d The lilting voice seemed to issue from Heaven itself but instead came from a tiny woman who appeared at Laurie\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cCirce!\u201d Achelous stopped in his tracks. \u201cWhat do you have to do with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sick of the way you treated your women, Achelous. Your handling of this problem with Gloriana was the last in a long line of intolerable acts. I could not stand by and let you get away with abusing this poor girl.\u201d Circe, a goddess in her own right, had also stuck to the Roman look. I guess it was the norm up on Olympus.</p><p>She walked up to Achelous and, though she only came up to the middle of his chest, her regal air gave her an imposing presence. She had a breathtaking beauty, with mesmerizing vivid green eyes and her raven hair flowing down her back. But that wasn\u2019t what made her formidable. It was the power that shimmered around her. I sure wouldn\u2019t want to cross her.</p><p>\u201cAnd how is that your business?\u201d Achelous looked down his nose at her, obviously not intimidated.</p><p>\u201cAs a woman, I decided to make it my business.\u201d She poked his broad chest with a pearl white fingernail. \u201cYou cast Gloriana out without proper resources.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I did. She never appreciated the gold and jewels she had as one of my women. I wanted her to lose everything.\u201d Achelous spat the last word.</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t allow you to reduce her to such dire straits. She was close to starving. She had no way to earn a living.\u201d Circe smiled and held out her hand, compelling me to come closer until I faced Achelous too. \u201cExcept whoring. And she was too proud for that, weren\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d I did remember those days. After my husband had died, I\u2019d been tossed out of our lodgings. I\u2019d begged Shakespeare to let me do the odd sewing and cleaning jobs around the theater. Those had barely paid for food but at least he\u2019d let me sleep in the dressing rooms.</p><p>\u201cToo good to be a whore?\u201d Achelous laughed. \u201cWhy? What do you think a Siren is?\u201d</p><p>The crack of my hand hitting Achelous\u2019s cheek was as loud as a gunshot. And it felt good. That bastard had it coming. For what he did constantly to Aggie and the other sisters. And what he\u2019d done to me.</p><p>\u201cYou are truly dead now, you bitch.\u201d Achelous\u2019s eyes flamed and he raised his hands, static electricity crackling from his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cNo, she is not.\u201d Circe thrust herself between us. \u201cYou must be stopped, Achelous. I proved I could thwart you when I took this man\u201d\u2014she pointed to Jerry and my heart sank\u2014\u201cand sent him into her path. He, of course, fell in love with her and made her vampire. I ensured she would have immortality and all the years you would have stolen from her, you pompous ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dare talk to me this way?\u201d Achelous unleashed clouds, rain and wind that almost blew us off the terrace. Flo and I clung to each other and even Laurie had to crouch down next to the stone wall or be thrown into the lake.</p><p>\u201cYou owed me this.\u201d Circe stood toe-to-toe with him, raising her own hands to stop the deluge instantly.</p><p>\u201cHow is that?\u201d He looked her over with what started as a sneer. While the rest of us were basically drowned rats, Circe\u2019s hair dried instantly into beautiful curls. Her toga clung to her perfect figure in all the right places and Achy showed a typical male appreciation for it before he remembered he was furious with her. His face hardened. \u201cI owe you nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t keep your word to me about a certain matter.\u201d She placed her hand on his chest and whatever she did must have hurt, because the god actually winced and jerked her hand away to hold it.</p><p>\u201cThis is not something to discuss in front of inferiors. Are you saying you deliberately used this vampire so that Gloriana would live forever?\u201d Achelous turned to hit Jerry with a shot of lightning and I screamed his name when I saw him shudder with pain.</p><p>\u201cStop! She just said he was her victim.\u201d Oh, God. All those years of Jerry\u2019s devotion, protection, love. They had been because two gods had been playing games with us as pawns. Was anything in my life real?</p><p>\u201cDeliberate or not, the result is the same, Gloriana. You are still here.\u201d Achelous started to hit me with a bolt, I was sure of it, but Circe reached out to stop him.</p><p>\u201cTell her why you cast her out. She deserves to know.\u201d Circe gave me a pitying look. Flo had her arm around me because I\u2019d started crying. Who wouldn\u2019t? But I shoved her away, out of the line of fire, when it looked like I might be getting hit.</p><p>\u201cI already know. I\u2019m not a killer or not much of one, am I? Move, Flo. If he\u2019s going to zap me into oblivion, I don\u2019t want you to be collateral damage.\u201d I wiped my eyes. \u201cYeah, Achelous. Be a sport. Tell everyone what I did to get kicked out of the Siren sisterhood. For some reason I\u2019m not ashamed to be your castoff.\u201d My legs went weak but I managed to stay upright as I braced myself for the god\u2019s worst.</p><p>Circe gave Achelous a look that made me think there was some serious mental messaging going on. \u201cYou have quite an attitude, Gloriana, and remind me...\u201d Circe shook her head. \u201cSpeak, Achelous. Explain your actions to the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Gloriana, yes, you were a failure as a Siren. And since Circe is so down on men, let me get a female witness up here. Someone she\u2019ll believe.\u201d Achy walked over to the stone wall, shoving Laurie out of the way. \u201cWhat in the hell is a tiger doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s one of mine and fetched me. Touch her again and you\u2019ll regret it.\u201d Circe watched him closely.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. Aglaophonos, get your ass back here!\u201d He leaned against the wall near where Laurie watched him with narrowed eyes. \u201cLet me see it. Change into your tiger. Should be amusing. Though your human form is not bad.\u201d He was checking her out. Her soaked tank top would have made her a winner in any wet T-shirt contest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot on your life.\u201d Laurie raked him with a disgusted look then stalked over to stand next to me. \u201cI\u2019m not a circus sideshow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould have fooled me.\u201d Achy had obviously gotten another mental message from Circe. \u201cYou women are really on a roll tonight. Don\u2019t think I\u2019ll forget this, Circe. When we get to Olympus, we\u2019re going to the top about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Achy. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d Circe didn\u2019t look concerned.</p> <p>\u201cYes, sire. What do you wish?\u201d Aggie climbed out over the stone wall, her wet dress clinging to her body. I\u2019m sure Jerry and Rafe appreciated the view; Achelous certainly did.</p><p>\u201cTell the group here how many kills you have. Since you became Siren.\u201d Achy stroked Aggie\u2019s wet shoulder in a familiar way that made me shudder.</p><p>\u201cOne million, seven hundred fifty thousand, five hundred six.\u201d Aggie smiled apologetically. \u201cIt would be more but GPS and other things\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, we get it.\u201d Achy looked proud while I felt like throwing up. Over a million people killed? And she\u2019d smiled, with no regrets except that she\u2019d posted what she seemed to think was a low number. \u201cNow I know you\u2019ve been snooping in the archives about Gloriana here. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Is it forbidden?\u201d She blanched when he tugged on her wet hair.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019ll let it go this time. Tell the crowd how many kills she had before I tossed her out on her fat ass.\u201d He gave me an evil smile. \u201cI made you wide on purpose when I tossed you, by the way. Bet that bothers you, doesn\u2019t it, Gloriana? Look at this Siren next to me.\u201d He ran his hand down Aggie\u2019s hip. \u201cHer body is perfect. I wasn\u2019t about to let you have the same.\u201d He frowned at me and I braced myself. \u201cGo ahead, Aglaophonos, spit it out. Gloriana\u2019s kill number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an embarrassment to you, sire. A mere one hundred and thirty-three thousand, four hundred sixty-one. And she\u2019d worked for you for over a thousand years!\u201d Aggie gave me a censorious look. \u201cShe was a disgrace to the sisterhood.\u201d</p><p>I hit the ground. Yep, my legs just could not hold me up. I\u2019d killed over a hundred thousand men. And no telling how many more I\u2019d seduced and let go. Thunder roared, lightning flashed and, for me, darkness fell.</p><p>\u2022 \u2022 \u2022</p><p>\u201cGlory! Wake up!\u201d I felt hands on my back and groaned. Obviously Achelous had given me a parting shot of lightning as a going-away present. I sat up carefully, my feet and head Pain Central. I wasn\u2019t surprised to see my boots were charred on the soles.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Flo brushed back my wet hair and stared at me anxiously. \u201cThat bastard. He hit you with such a jolt. I was afraid you were done for.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. He and Circe just disappeared after that. Aggie too.\u201d Laurie paced around us. \u201cWhat a nightmare. I\u2019m pissed that I couldn\u2019t do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? Laurie, you brought Circe here. She saved me.\u201d I reached down and unzipped one of my ruined boots, tossing it aside. The effort made my head throb but my feet were much worse. I hurriedly got rid of the other boot. Healing sleep would take care of my feet eventually but I dreaded the walk back to the car.</p><p>\u201cYes, well. You\u2019re right. I guess I did earn that paycheck, Flo.\u201d Laurie grinned then gasped when she saw my blackened feet. \u201cDamn, but he got you good, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to need help.\u201d Rafe stood behind Flo. \u201cLet me carry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll do it. I may be under a damned spell, but I still want to take care of Gloriana.\u201d Jerry squatted down next to me.</p><p>\u201cJerry.\u201d I reached out to touch his cheek. \u201cWhat you heard...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know we were both manipulated, Gloriana.\u201d He carefully slipped his arms under my hips and lifted me. \u201cI\u2019ll carry you to your car. Florence can drive you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you ever forgive me?\u201d I whispered this against his chest as he strode across the rough terrain to where we\u2019d left my car.</p> <p>\u201cForgive you?\u201d He stopped and looked up at the sky instead of down at me. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d He started walking again, stopping beside my car and waiting while a silent Flo opened the passenger door.</p><p>\u201cOh, your beautiful car!\u201d She began pushing water out of the seat with her hands.</p><p>I glanced down. Right. I\u2019d left the top down and Achelous had made it rain buckets. Swell. One more thing the god had ruined tonight.</p><p>\u201cFlo, relax. Gloriana can have it dried out professionally. I\u2019m sure insurance will cover it.\u201d Jerry shifted me in his arms, like he was anxious to get rid of me. I didn\u2019t blame him. \u201cYou are both already wet and I don\u2019t think the engine has come to any harm. The keys are in it. See if it will start.\u201d Jerry spoke calmly as he set me in the passenger seat and secured my seat belt. Flo scurried around to the other side and soon had the engine purring, all the while muttering in fierce Italian and English about Sirens and gods who threw rain and lightning around.</p><p>\u201cJerry, are you, I mean, will you come over? To talk about what just happened?\u201d I leaned back in the seat. Had I ever been this wet or this miserable before? Even the pain in my burned feet was minor compared to the terror I felt about my relationship with Jerry. And Rafe? He stood behind Jerry, his gaze questioning.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight, Gloriana. Let your friends take care of you. I need some time. To think. Surely you understand.\u201d He closed the car door. \u201cI\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory!\u201d Rafe moved up to take Jerry\u2019s place next to the door. \u201cIf you need me, call.\u201d He reached through the open window and cupped my cheek. \u201cFor blood to help you heal. For anything. What you heard tonight... I know it\u2019s not what you wanted to hear. But it makes no difference to me. I don\u2019t need time to think.\u201d He leaned down and kissed my forehead then slapped the hood as Flo began to slowly back the car down the driveway.</p><p>I saw Laurie standing by her own car, just observing the scene. She stopped Rafe when he turned away and I saw them talk to each other. Jerry had disappeared. He\u2019d probably shifted to get here and was already flying home.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, really?\u201d Flo asked as soon as we were on the open road.</p><p>\u201cHorrible.\u201d I looked at her. She was soaked, her outfit ruined, her hair plastered to her head. \u201cHow are you going to explain this to Richard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to have to confess everything. He will be furious, of course, that I went to see the Storm God with you and didn\u2019t tell him... Hah! As if I would have wanted him there.\u201d Flo\u2019s eyes glistened with tears. \u201cThat Achelous. Ch\u00e9 bastardo! I hate him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we can agree on that.\u201d I patted her hand on the steering wheel. \u201cI\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t hurt but that won\u2019t help soothe Richard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019ll let him get me into the shower since I am so upset, you see. That will make everything all right.\u201d Flo winked at me. \u201cOr at least help him forget I was in danger.\u201d She squeezed my hand. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t. Not really. I was scared for you, amica. That god was so angry. He wanted to kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for us, Circe is for women\u2019s rights.\u201d I managed a smile. \u201cAnd Laurie. She really did come through for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u00ed. I\u2019ll meet her tomorrow night to pay her.\u201d Flo held up her hand when she saw I was going to object, offer to pay. \u201cI am glad to do it. She saved our butts. No?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she did. Who knew she had connections on Olympus?\u201d I leaned back and closed my eyes. \u201cAt least I had on my old boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I checked the trunk. Our new shoes are still dry. Somehow Aggie got hers already or I would have thrown them into the lake. So many men she killed! I cannot like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed\u2014\u201d</p><p>Flo reached over and clapped her hand over my mouth. \u201cWe will never speak of that again. I will not tell Ricardo that part either. You were a different person then, Glory. A different, how you say, species, I guess. So you cannot be held to blame. Move on. It is what I do when I have done something I am not so proud of. And I have plenty, I tell you, in my past that I would rather not think of again.\u201d She took her hand away. \u201cIs it a deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to cry. No, that had to be water from my wet hair dripping into my eyes. But could I have a better friend? I certainly hated to see her head to Paris. My phone bill was obviously going to be astronomical because who else could I talk to about girl stuff?</p><p>When we got to my apartment, Flo fussed about how I was going to get up the stairs on my blistered feet. Obviously Rafe had figured things out because he showed up next to the car, shifting out of bird form just as Flo was about to call Richard for help.</p><p>\u201cI snapped to the fact that you weren\u2019t going to be able to make the stairs.\u201d He eased me from the seat and lifted me into his arms. \u201cThis okay?\u201d</p><p>I snuggled against him. We were both wet but I could feel his shifter\u2019s heat through our clothes. \u201cMore than okay. You\u2019re a godsend. No, scratch that. Not mentioning gods. Or at least\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to make sense now, Glory. Just close your eyes and let me carry you to your bed.\u201d Rafe\u2019s deep voice made his chest vibrate under my cheek. I sighed and relaxed, letting him take over.</p><p>Flo ran ahead, taking care of security codes and opening doors. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out of those wet clothes but I don\u2019t want you to have to stand on your feet. If you lay on your bed...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet Rafe take over, Flo.\u201d I waved her off when she began to pluck at my wet jeans. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m beyond being embarrassed and you need to get home to Richard. He\u2019s bound to be worried about you. It\u2019s late and we were only supposed to go shopping. The mall closed hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Flo dug into her purse, which fortunately we\u2019d stuck in the trunk of my car before we\u2019d headed to that terrace. \u201cYes, he\u2019s called and left messages. I think it\u2019s better if I just go home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re right.\u201d I held out my hand. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget how you were there for me tonight. Mi amica. That\u2019s what you call me. You\u2019re the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not make me cry.\u201d Flo sniffled then gave Rafe an assessing look. \u201cYou will be a gentleman, eh? She has been through too much. Help her get clean and dry and put to bed. Give her some of your blood if she wants. That\u2019s all. Capite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it, Flo.\u201d Rafe kissed the top of my head. \u201cNo hanky-panky. I\u2019m not the asshole Achelous was. Glory\u2019s beat. Traumatized. I\u2019m not about to make some stupid move on her now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m here you know. And if I want him to climb into my bed for more than a snooze, that\u2019s on me.\u201d I winked at Flo, though I knew that was the last complication I needed right now. \u201cGood night, Flo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you tomorrow night. If you want me to cancel my trip to Paris, say the word.\u201d She also sent me a mental message not to do anything foolish with Rafe.</p><p>\u201cNo, take your trip. And quit worrying about me. I\u2019m going to survive. I\u2019ve managed things so far. Maybe I can get Laurie to give me Circe\u2019s phone number. Find out how I can get rid of this Siren whammy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure I\u2019d do that, Glory.\u201d Rafe smiled down at me. \u201cIt\u2019s come in handy for you over the years. Bought you protection at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m leaving. This isn\u2019t something for her to talk about now, Rafael. Get her in the shower, dry her off, feed her. Now, good night.\u201d Flo stalked out of the apartment and closed the door.</p> <p>\u201cWe have our orders.\u201d Rafe carried me into the bathroom. He carefully set me on the closed toilet and pulled my ruined red sweater off over my head. Then he reached back and turned on the water in the tub since it took a while to heat up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure these jeans will come off. They were snug when they were dry.\u201d I got the button open and the zipper down. \u201cThat damned Achelous. To deliberately give me wide hips. How mean can you get?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t wide. They\u2019re perfect.\u201d Rafe lifted one hip and managed to slide the jeans and my panties down then did the same with the other. He was very careful when he had to pull them off over my wounded feet. Still, I hissed when the stiff fabric rubbed against them.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rafe.\u201d I reached behind me to unclasp my bra. He was being very clinical about undressing me, for which I was grateful. I knew he still wanted me; I could see the bulge in his own wet jeans.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He wrapped a towel around me. \u201cI\u2019m thinking you can\u2019t get in this tub with your feet like this. It will be agony.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the filling tub then down at my feet. \u201cGod, you\u2019re right. The very thought of that hot water touching them...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m carrying you to bed and feeding you first.\u201d He turned off the water then started to lift me in his arms again.</p><p>\u201cWait. Take off your shirt. It\u2019s soaked and you can dry off. I\u2019ve got one of your old T-shirts in my dresser drawer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He jerked off the shirt then picked me up and carried me to bed. He laid me down gently then disappeared into the bathroom again. When he came out he was wearing only a towel around his lean hips. \u201cGive me another minute and I\u2019ll throw my jeans into the dryer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d I lay back and closed my eyes, so exhausted I couldn\u2019t have put logical thoughts together if I\u2019d tried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m back. Did you doze off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d I felt the bed sag as Rafe sat beside me.</p><p>\u201cDrink from me, Glory. You\u2019ve got to get those feet healed. You also have bruises on your shoulders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a killer headache too.\u201d Killer. Oh, God. I looked away from Rafe.</p> <p>\u201cStop. You are not that person. Not like Aggie.\u201d Rafe gently turned my chin so that I faced him. \u201cThat bastard really did a number on you, in more ways than one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstatement. The way he and Circe manipulated all of us. Like Jerry said.\u201d Rafe\u2019s mouth tightened at the mention of Jerry\u2019s name. I reached up to trace those lines. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re also one of my victims. Do you hate that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d He leaned down and kissed me carefully on the lips. \u201cDrink from me. At least heal before you try to reason any of this out.\u201d He pulled my arms around his neck and offered his throat.</p><p>I was powerless to resist as I slid my lips along his jaw to the sweet spot where I could hear his blood pumping and smell the richness calling to me. Rafe was right. I had to feed and he had just what I needed.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Rafe. You know I love you, don\u2019t you?\u201d I didn\u2019t give him time to answer before I took his vein. Sank into him with a sigh. It was bliss and I felt the power surge instantly. I knew my feet were healing and strength flowed into me as my headache evaporated. Rafe\u2019s blood had that special something, his own shifter essence that made me want to drink forever but I knew I was going to have to pull away soon.</p><p>\u201cWell, I see I needn\u2019t have worried, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>I jerked away from Rafe, his arm steady around me as I grabbed at my slipping towel.</p><p>\u201cJerry! You came back.\u201d I didn\u2019t stop Rafe as he stood, his own towel not doing much to disguise the fact that our closeness hadn\u2019t left him unmoved.</p><p>\u201cLike a fool.\u201d Jerry stood in the bedroom doorway, his fists clenched. He\u2019d changed clothes and was nice and dry. It almost made me mad to realize that had been his first priority.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I sat up and grabbed the sheet to better cover myself with. \u201cRafe was feeding me. You saw my feet. I needed blood to heal. Are you standing there jumping to conclusions or will you listen to the facts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat difference does it make, Gloriana? I am powerless to resist you. Whatever you tell me, whatever you do, I will come back to you. Always.\u201d He ran his hands through his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to take what we just heard out there by the lake. I tried to stay away from here just now. But I kept seeing you lying there on that terrace, hurt.\u201d He swept his eyes over Rafe. \u201cI should have known one of your other victims would be here for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Blade.\u201d Rafe stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cNo, let him get this off his chest.\u201d I wiggled my toes and realized my feet were healed enough for me to get up. I dragged the sheet around me and stood next to Rafe. \u201cYou\u2019re both my victims, I get that and I hate it. Whatever you need to do, Jerry. Do it. I won\u2019t hold it against you.\u201d Even though my heart was breaking at the look on his face.</p><p>\u201cI need time. And space. To think about this tale the Storm God told us. I\u2019m going home.\u201d Jerry stared at me, searching my face. For what? Signs that I wanted him to stay? I kept my face carefully neutral, refusing to work any womanly wiles on him.</p><p>\u201cHome? And where would that be? You\u2019ve been a nomad for the last few decades.\u201d My energy for bravado leached out of me and I dropped to the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201cCastle Campbell. My roots, you could say. Leave me alone for a while, Gloriana, and I\u2019ll see if I can do the same for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDramatic much, Blade?\u201d Rafe shook his head. \u201cGive the woman a break. Clearly none of this is her fault. You sound like you\u2019re punishing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBugger off, Valdez. You\u2019re so eager to be her lapdog, have at it.\u201d Jerry stepped into the room and grabbed me by my shoulders. He jerked me to my feet and kissed me. It was an angry kiss, a seeking kiss and a farewell kiss all in one. I didn\u2019t fight it, just leaned into it. Even tried to hold on to him and send him mental messages not to go, that we could work it out. But too soon he thrust me at Rafe and stormed out of the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Glory. Sorry the man is such a hardheaded Scot.\u201d Rafe caught me as I staggered.</p><p>\u201cHardheaded? Yes. But also hurt, disappointed. I...\u201d I had nothing else to say. And neither did Rafe as he settled me in bed again. He tenderly covered me with my floral comforter.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea, Rafe. No idea at all.\u201d I closed my eyes and wished it was time for my death sleep. Death. A nice solution to what seemed like insurmountable problems and, yes, so deliciously permanent.</p><p>Thirteen</p><p>A couple of weeks went by. My life was actually getting back to normal. Hah! As if I knew what normal looked like. I couldn\u2019t get a handle on my new identity for one thing. Gloriana the Siren turned vampire had to be careful even waiting on a male customer. I felt like I should wear a surgical mask so I wouldn\u2019t spread my fatal attraction. It would have helped with my red cheeks too. I laid foundation and cover stick on with a trowel and still looked like I\u2019d spent too long under a sunlamp.</p><p>Rafe, of course, wanted to be there for me. I had to gently remind him of his promise to move on with his life. He didn\u2019t take it well. Which meant I tried to avoid him. No N-V for me. Translation: no social life. Fine. I wasn\u2019t up for fun anyway. Even a cell phone commercial about dropped calls could make me weepy.</p><p>I decided my best move was to throw myself into my business. Flo had headed to Paris on schedule with Richard mad at me again. Seems I was the one who always got his wife in danger. I couldn\u2019t blame him for his attitude and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he kept them over there on one pretext or another for months.</p><p>I missed having a best friend around and Penny was a poor substitute. She never had been all that interested in fashion and even let me pick out her wardrobe\u2014something Flo would never have allowed. That shopping spree was fun for about five minutes then I had nothing else to do in my spare time. Jenny might have been a good companion for shopping and had even started hanging around the shop. But she watched me like she wanted to catch me with my fangs down. Her endless questions about the vampire lifestyle were getting on my last nerve. I was very afraid she was thinking about a pair of fangs as a college graduation present.</p><p>I rattled around in my empty apartment, rearranging furniture and overdosing on reruns of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I think Jenny would have been on board with joining me but her football games and sorority mixers were a conflict during Buffy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I missed Jerry and seriously intended giving him the time he thought he needed. But it was almost impossible. I\u2019d go from being sad and crying into my pillow to ashamed that I\u2019d been part of this scam that had hooked him in the first place. It was a short drive from there to furious at the world, Achelous, and Jerry himself for giving up on us so easily. Finally I worked and reworked my checkbook, trying to figure out if there was any way I could get my butt to Scotland.</p><p>It was no use. Even though I knew Erin and Lacy could handle the shop for me\u2014they were urging me to get my gloomy face out of town\u2014I just couldn\u2019t afford the trip. The shop did okay and the rocky economy helped my kind of store. Vintage clothing was cheaper than the brand-new mall variety unless it was designer. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t find the really quality stuff that often. And my overhead was steep. Prime locations like mine on Sixth Street cost plenty and I paid my help well, especially the day crew. It was critical that I trust them not to drop the ball while I was dead to the world.</p><p>So the reality was that flying overseas was an expensive proposition and not in my budget. My friends who\u2019d flown to Paris had shared a chartered flight. Jerry had probably shifted and taken off on his own wings\u2014the man had no fear. Me? I had to screw up my courage to shift and fly across town. So I would have to drive or catch a plane to either Dallas or Houston for a transatlantic flight that would cross during the night and still arrive in London or Edinburgh before dawn, a scheduling nightmare.</p> <p>I had a horror of falling into my death sleep on a commercial flight. Yeah, picture a puzzled flight attendant trying to deal with my \u201cbody\u201d when we arrived at Heathrow Airport. See? Logistics were almost impossible. Not to mention I\u2019d be paying off the credit card bills for years afterward. And what if Jerry just slammed the castle doors in my face when I got there? Oh, how pathetic could I get, chasing after a man who didn\u2019t want me? Or at least didn\u2019t want to want me.</p><p>Erin poked her head into the back room. \u201cGlory? You\u2019ve got company up front. She\u2019s, uh, vampire and says you know her, but she\u2019s got some serious bodyguards. You want to slide out the back door and I\u2019ll tell her you must have already left?\u201d</p><p>I almost welcomed the distraction from my discouraging math. I threw down my calculator. \u201cDid she give you a name?\u201d A woman with bodyguards. And Erin hadn\u2019t recognized her. Must be someone from my past.</p><p>\u201cNo. She wants to surprise you. Which kind of worries me. She has a hard edge to her even though she\u2019s wearing the most fabulous suit. And then she\u2019s put a few high-dollar items in a stack on the counter, obviously to buy. So I didn\u2019t dare alienate her.\u201d Erin glanced back over her shoulder. \u201cGuess I talk too much. Here she comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory!\u201d A perfectly manicured hand shoved Erin out of the way and the door banged open wide. \u201cWhen I heard someone in Austin was asking about me, I just had to come check it out personally.\u201d</p> <p>I backed up and grabbed for the nearest thing that could pass for a weapon. The calculator was a cheapie from China so it wouldn\u2019t incite fear unless the woman had a math phobia. I knew this one actually loved everything to do with numbers as long as they had dollar signs in front of them.</p><p>\u201cLucky, what are you doing here? I sure didn\u2019t ask about you.\u201d But I knew who had. Ian had stuck his Scottish nose into her business when he\u2019d been investigating my blood. \u201cYou can go back to Europe now. In fact, didn\u2019t your daddy forbid you to ever darken my door again?\u201d He had. Luciana Carvarelli aka Lucky Carver had worked for her father\u2019s loan-sharking business as a debt collector. After she\u2019d been turned vampire in my back alley, just a few feet from where I stood now, she\u2019d managed to alienate most of Austin\u2019s paranormal community. Papa Carvarelli, who did good business with paranormals, had banished her to Eastern Europe as punishment.</p><p>\u201cDaddy died a few months ago. Heart attack.\u201d Lucky sighed, then pasted on a bright smile. So much for mourning. \u201cI\u2019m in charge of the business now. I can go where I damn well please. I\u2019m at the headquarters in New York again. But I thought a little visit to my sire would be a nice vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVacation?\u201d I put down the calculator. Yes, I was her sire. Not my proudest moment, though I had saved her life. Hindsight, I\u2019d have been doing the world and especially Ray a favor if I\u2019d let her bleed out when I\u2019d found her behind my shop.</p><p>\u201cI liked Austin when I was here.\u201d Lucky looked around and pounced on a vintage designer scarf I hadn\u2019t priced yet. She flipped her hair which was a rich deep mahogany this season behind her back and secured it into a low ponytail with the scarf. \u201cNice piece. Add it to my tab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be expensive.\u201d</p> <p>She waved her hand. \u201cAs if I care. Good to see you\u2019re still here. So many small businesses are going under these days.\u201d She gave me the once-over then frowned. \u201cYou could do with a fashion intervention. What\u2019s up with the black? Somebody die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnd-of-month laundry crisis. Not that it\u2019s any of your concern.\u201d I gritted my teeth. Of course she was another of those great-looking women with a perfect figure. I seemed to be surrounded by them.</p><p>Tonight\u2019s awful outfit had been a result of my don\u2019t-give-a-damn attitude lately. Maybe I should check with Ian about vampire Prozac. Right. And I\u2019d probably break out in hives or grow a third boob. Damn that Siren blood.</p><p>\u201cGlory, where is your brain tonight? Pay attention. You need to treat yourself. You\u2019ve got some great stock just a few feet away.\u201d Lucky inspected a shelf of sweaters intended for a sale table. \u201cI obviously should have come back sooner. I like your little shop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that desperate for business, Lucky.\u201d</p><p>She whirled around and glared at me, a coral cashmere sweater in her hand. \u201cAre you saying I can\u2019t shop here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have amnesia or something? Your time in Austin was a train wreck. You created chaos. And I\u2019ll never forgive you for what you did to Israel Caine.\u201d I stalked to the back door, unlocked it and threw it open. \u201cTake a hike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Glory. Settle down. I admit I could have handled things a little more diplomatically when I was here before.\u201d She dropped the sweater back on the shelf. \u201cBut I was a new vampire. The whole dying and waking up with fangs thing did a number on me. I was crazed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShould have remembered that before you passed on the experience. And I\u2019m not buying that excuse. Most of your bad behavior was you being you, Lucky. Don\u2019t bother to deny it.\u201d I wasn\u2019t budging. I wanted her out of there. What she\u2019d done to Ray was unforgivable.</p><p>\u201cI had things I had to work out. As my sire you were supposed to help me deal with my new condition. I realize now I shoulda let you.\u201d She smiled and held out her hands. \u201cMy bad judgment. I know that now. But I\u2019m here to fix that. You owe me a certain amount of guidance, you know. To keep me from making more mistakes. I\u2019ve asked around to other vamps I\u2019ve met since then. You and me, we have a bond, a blood tie. I have some questions for you now and you owe me answers.\u201d Lucky turned and spoke to the twin hulks who\u2019d been on high alert standing in the doorway to the shop. \u201cShut the door and wait outside. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to deny it but didn\u2019t bother as the door closed. I had a few things I wanted to say. \u201cI gave you immortality, Lucky. Something you made damned sure I regretted. If I wanted to take that away from you, I have the power. I\u2019m not the same woman you left here with a naked rock star in her bed.\u201d I was snarling I was so furious.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can see that. I like you better for it.\u201d Lucky actually grinned and it was all I could do not to knock her against the wall. Why was I hesitating? I could certainly turn her into a statue and do whatever I wanted to her. But did I want to show her my power? No.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t like me, just leave.\u201d I counted to ten, deciding letting her goad me was just playing into her hands.</p><p>\u201cNot till I get what I want. Now calm down and talk to me like a sire should.\u201d She walked over and brushed the seat of my lone chair. She had on a cream wool pantsuit that looked straight from Milan. The buttoned jacket was cut to showcase her figure and she obviously wore nothing underneath it except a slim gold chain that dipped into her cleavage. That scarf she\u2019d added couldn\u2019t have been more perfect. It had a cream, gold and red design that made her pale skin and hazel eyes glow.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m going to dish with you? Like we\u2019re girlfriends or something?\u201d I finally shut the back door and paced in front of her, feeling dowdier by the minute. She set a red leather purse I\u2019d have killed for on the floor and pulled out a small electronic tablet. She clicked it on. Right. She was planning to write down my words of wisdom.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me. You made me a vampire. We share the same blood.\u201d She smiled serenely, showing the tips of her fangs. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve discovered, with the help of an old crone in the Trans area, that our blood is something special. At the time I blew it off, figuring it was a fairy tale\u2014the woman owed me money. Then I get to New York and a doctor looks me up asking about my blood too. So I\u2019m thinking maybe there\u2019s something to it and I should go to the source.\u201d She pointed at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I tell you anything? Lucky, you killed a man I care about. Ruined his life. Ray and I are close now.\u201d I jerked that damned tablet out of her hand, then tossed it on the table behind me. \u201cHe\u2019s been suicidal since you left. And no wonder. He was a sun worshiper and you made him lose daylight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that!\u201d She widened her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s why making him vampire was the perfect payback for what he did to me. He broke my heart.\u201d She wasn\u2019t smiling now and her fangs were long and lethal. She jumped to her feet. \u201cYou expect me to feel sorry for that asshole just because you\u2019re probably banging him now? No fucking way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay and I aren\u2019t...\u201d I decided my exact relationship with Ray was not something I needed to clear up. \u201cGuess that\u2019s my answer to you when you want info from me. Forget it.\u201d I shoved her back down in her chair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave the rock star out of this, okay?\u201d She waited and I decided she wanted me to nod or something.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a little hard to do, Lucky. You dropped him in my lap, remember? I may be your sire, but you\u2019re his. Funny, but he\u2019s not exactly looking to you for a bonding moment, is he? At least not without a stake in his hand.\u201d I crossed my arms over my chest. I\u2019d consider that fair warning. Bodyguards or not, Lucky was going to have to watch her back while she was in Austin. Once Ray found out she was here...? I didn\u2019t want to imagine the confrontation between those two.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I knew you\u2019d take good care of him. Who could miss the pile of Israel Caine memorabilia you had in your place? What did you call it? The shrine? I knew you\u2019d be thrilled to play vamp mommy to that bad boy. Was I right?\u201d She actually grinned at me.</p> <p>\u201cOh, sure. I got to be his savior while he figured out he\u2019d never see the sun again. You remember how you felt waking up with fangs? It was much, much worse for Ray. He didn\u2019t even know vampires existed until he became one.\u201d I grabbed her by the lapels of a suit that cost more than the sum total of my clothing budget for the year. \u201cGet this straight, Lucky. It was hell pulling Ray through his transition. And he\u2019s still not 100 percent into being a vampire. You RUINED. HIS. LIFE.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough. Shit.\u201d She jerked my hands off her jacket and examined the cloth with a frown. \u201cI gifted you with the man of your dreams, Glory, and don\u2019t bother to deny it. Where\u2019s the gratitude?\u201d</p><p>I just shook my head. Obviously I was wasting my time trying to find this woman\u2019s compassion.</p><p>\u201cJust listen to my proposition. I\u2019m not asking you to toss me a freebie. I learned at my father\u2019s knee that you don\u2019t get anything without paying for it.\u201d Lucky was breathing hard so I guess I had gotten to her a little. Rookie. She didn\u2019t remember that lung action wasn\u2019t necessary for us.</p><p>I knew I should throw her out on her perfect ass right then and there. Instead, she must have noticed my hesitation and plowed ahead.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ll pay. I remember that you were always hard up for cash. I\u2019m sure if nothing else you\u2019d like to update your wardrobe. That Transylvanian said I should get in touch with my sire. That you had a message for me. She was very specific. Psychic mumbo jumbo but I\u2019ve learned to listen to it.\u201d She put a fingernail in the middle of my stomach and shoved. \u201cBack up before I call in my boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious about listening to a Transylvanian witch? They\u2019re kooks, Lucky.\u201d I did step back and threw her tablet at her. Interesting that this crone had obviously picked up on Lucky\u2019s Siren blood. \u201cHere\u2019s a message: Get lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Pay attention, Glory. The really ancient Trans witches are powerful and have valuable knowledge that I paid to get.\u201d She arched a brow at me. \u201cLike I said, I\u2019m willing to throw money around when I want something and I went over there needing to find out more about this vampire business.\u201d She sighed and studied her nails. \u201cWithout a sire to guide me, what else could I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey obviously saw a sucker coming.\u201d I grinned. \u201cYou just wasted a trip. And know this.\u201d I got sober in a hurry. \u201cIf you pulled a stunt like turning Ray vamp today, the vampire council we\u2019ve got now would terminate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re playing hardball? Radical.\u201d Lucky didn\u2019t look concerned. \u201cEspecially for Austin, home of the proudly weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an empty threat. They offed a vampire recently who turned a college student.\u201d I sat on the table again.</p> <p>\u201cI stand warned. Now listen up. I bet, in spite of all this \u2018poor Ray\u2019 crap, I can get you interested in my little proposition.\u201d Lucky smiled, sure of herself on this turf. \u201cI am my father\u2019s daughter. A verbal contract will do. You clue me in with stuff I need to know. About our blood. I called this doctor, Ian MacDonald, when I got here. He won\u2019t tell me jack now except that he would like a sample of my blood. For some kind of experiment. Now you know I\u2019m not just handing over something without an explanation.\u201d Lucky shook her head. \u201cBut he just kept mum. Said any details would have to come from you. So here I am. I\u2019ll give you fifty large to tell me what you should tell me for free, sire. Deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty large. Is that fifty thousand?\u201d I swallowed, the amount more than adequate to get me to Scotland. Damn her for tempting me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Glory. American dollars, in case you didn\u2019t know that part. Not euros or dinars. Is it a deal?\u201d She held out her hand.</p><p>I thought about it. Hard. Could I be a sellout? But that money would buy all the plane tickets I needed to get overseas. Maybe I should give Jerry time, but with this much in my bank account I\u2019d have options. Maybe I should tell her about the blood. Ian swore it might be addictive. It was what any sire owed a vampire they\u2019d made.</p><p>\u201cI have conditions. First, you stay the hell away from Ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I figure I got my licks in. But if he comes after me...? My boys don\u2019t let anyone get near me with a stake. They don\u2019t care who he is or how many Grammys he\u2019s won. You might pass that word to your lover man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not\u2014\u201d I closed my eyes against the temptation her outstretched hand represented. This was wrong. I should let Jerry have the next century or so to lick his wounds, or maybe I could\u2014</p><p>\u201cClock\u2019s ticking, Glory. Don\u2019t you owe me a little guidance? Why not make a chunk of change and do your duty at the same time?\u201d Lucky dug into her purse again and pulled out a designer checkbook. \u201cA thousand bucks to get this party started.\u201d She filled out the check and signed it with a flourish then dropped it in my lap before settling back in her chair with a satisfied smile. \u201cCome on, Glo, spill.\u201d</p> <p>I bit my lip as Lucky obviously tried to read my thoughts. Not gonna happen. If Lucky stayed in town and began loaning money or collecting debts, she was bound to pick up gossip. Aggie didn\u2019t believe in keeping secrets and we hadn\u2019t exactly bonded.</p><p>\u201cOne more condition. You leave town again. I don\u2019t want you hanging around here where Ray can run into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, gee. Thanks for the warm, fuzzy feelings.\u201d Lucky showed her fangs. \u201cGive me two weeks. I do have some business here. And I want specifics, not some generic story you make up to get rid of me. Ways to verify the facts. First, what\u2019s up with our blood? What\u2019s special about it? That check is a down payment. Are we doing this deal or not?\u201d</p><p>Two weeks. An eternity or a mere blip when you live forever. I swallowed my guilt and held out my hand.</p><p>\u201cDeal. You\u2019d better not make me regret this, Lucky.\u201d I sat on the table and crossed my legs. I hated to admit it, but Lucky had been right about my clothes. My long black skirt and saggy black sweater had suited my mood when I\u2019d gotten dressed but they both needed to hit the charity gift bag sooner rather than later. I kicked at the table with my new black boots, the only stylish things I wore. Even my bra was old and comfy, stretched out and gray from too many washings and spins in a hot dryer.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Lucky had her tablet in hand again, ready to write.</p><p>\u201cOkay. About our blood. I started out life as a Siren. My blood is Siren blood and, even though Jerry made me a vampire, I still seem to have some Siren attributes.\u201d I almost laughed at the look on Lucky\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019re not typing. Don\u2019t you believe me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to make this into a joke, don\u2019t expect to keep my money.\u201d She tossed her things into that fabulous designer bag and jumped to her feet. I grabbed her arm before she could snatch that check.</p><p>\u201cI wish it was a joke, Lucky. Read my mind. I\u2019ll let you in this time. Or ask Dr. MacDonald. You can tell him to call me and I\u2019ll give him permission to share the blood test results.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI recently had a horrific meeting with the Storm God, Achelous, and he confirmed the whole thing. Before I met Jerry and he turned me vampire, I was a Siren. One of those creatures who lure sailors and their ships onto the rocks with their song. I killed over a hundred thousand men before Achelous kicked me out of his harem for being too soft on my victims.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious.\u201d Lucky looked me in the eyes. She was obviously reading my thoughts and checking my facts. \u201cThat is freaking awesome.\u201d</p><p>I sagged back on the table. I should have known that Lucky would be impressed rather than repulsed. After all, look at her idea of revenge on an old boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cAwesome? Are you kidding me? I have to live with the fact that my relationships with men aren\u2019t because they truly love me but because I have this power over them.\u201d I jumped when she moved closer and put her hands on my knees. \u201cAnd the doctor claims my blood may even be addictive. He wants to market it as a drug, to enhance power and libido.\u201d I really needed to shut up. Lucky looked like I\u2019d handed her the keys to the kingdom.</p><p>\u201cAre you listening to yourself?\u201d She was intensity personified. \u201cGlory, do you think you still have this fantastic power over men?\u201d</p><p>I forced myself to shrug like this was no big deal, like it hadn\u2019t caused my life to crash and burn.</p><p>\u201cApparently. I lost my memory of sitting on a rock, but seem to have kept some of the powers. Not sure exactly what yet. It\u2019s all new to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. You can make men fall in love with you. Girlfriend, that is freaking amazing.\u201d Lucky stepped back and sank onto her chair. \u201cCould I have possibly inherited that Siren thing from you when you gave me your blood? This old woman in the Trans told me she could tell by the smell that a nonhuman had made me. I laughed it off, called her crazy. I mean vamps aren\u2019t human, but used to be. Aw, shit, you know what I\u2019m trying to say.\u201d She closed her eyes and pressed her fingertips to her forehead. \u201cLet me think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d But I was thinking too. Could this Siren power be hereditary? I\u2019d had to give Lucky my blood to turn her. But I\u2019d given my blood to Jerry during sex how many hundreds of times? And to Ray whenever he\u2019d overdosed on alcohol. Even Rafe had needed to drink my blood once when he\u2019d been wounded. Surely my Siren magic couldn\u2019t be passed on so easily. Ian had discounted the possibility. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I rubbed my own forehead. This wasn\u2019t making much sense. But then we were talking paranormals. Freaks. Logic rarely had much to do with our world, even if Ian was always trying to make a case for it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to remember how I attracted the men I had relationships with in Europe. If I had to put any effort into it.\u201d Lucky opened her eyes and smiled. \u201cOf course I\u2019d had work done before I was turned and was in the best shape of my life, thanks be to God. So I had plenty of success. Men were after me all the time. But I thought, okay, it\u2019s the vampire thing. It\u2019s sexy to flash your fangs. And we have that great libido.\u201d She winked. \u201cOf course men go for a woman who wants it often and likes to get her kink on. I know my way around a bedroom too. I certainly never had any complaints in that department before or after I got my fangs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTMI, Lucky. But I get what you mean.\u201d She didn\u2019t look close to her real age which I knew was pushing fifty. She\u2019d had a top-tier plastic surgeon on speed dial when she\u2019d been mortal so her \u201cwork\u201d had been flawless. Now she\u2019d forever look like a midthirties woman in her prime.</p> <p>Yes, no wonder they called her Lucky. But the fact was our history made me hate being in the same room with her. Ray was going to go ballistic when I told him I was cooperating with her. And I had to get to him fast, before he heard it somewhere else. Two weeks. Was there any way to speed her on her way out of town faster?</p><p>\u201cI think my numbers were up in Europe. So the Siren thing could have been working for me.\u201d She adjusted her jacket so that it showed even more cleavage. \u201cBut I never stick with one guy for long. My experience with Ray ruined me for long-term relationships. I have trust issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. You know he was forced to break up with you back then. Your father\u2019s goons threatened him.\u201d I would never forget the story of how Ray had almost been castrated by Mr. Carvarelli\u2019s men. Her father had decided the unknown singer wasn\u2019t good enough for his daughter. That incident had convinced Ray to break up with Lucky and leave town without a word of explanation to her. This had been way before Ray had become famous.</p><p>\u201cI know that now. I didn\u2019t know it when I was young and in love!\u201d Lucky jerked the scarf off her hair and stuffed it into her purse. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get over my issues. Europe was good for me. In the man department anyway. I had my pick and played the field. But I can\u2019t really say I was that much more successful.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cCould have just been the vamp thing. So I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m buying your Siren story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuy it or not, it\u2019s true. About me anyway. Go by Ian MacDonald\u2019s house. He has a lab there. He can test your blood and see if it matches mine. I have no idea whether you inherited the man magnetism or not. I don\u2019t control stuff like that.\u201d I sighed. \u201cLook. I held up our side of the deal and I need to get out of here. We\u2019re done. I\u2019ll take the rest of the money now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, no. We\u2019re not done. There have to be powers that go with the blood thing. We\u2019re meeting again. After I get MacDonald\u2019s confirmation.\u201d She handed me a business card. \u201cI know where you live. I expect to hear from you soon. And don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting any more money yet. That little tidbit wasn\u2019t worth even the first grand. I want to hear more about this Siren business. Capite?\u201d</p><p>The Italian word made my eyes mist as I thought about my buddy Flo, so far away. I could really use her wise advice right now.</p><p>Lucky wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cI want your best sire effort for fifty large. And we have a contract. So I don\u2019t want to hear any more about it. You don\u2019t like dealing with me? Tough.\u201d</p><p>I stalked over and threw open the door into the shop. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s next, fledgling. As your sire, I call the shots. Now get the hell out. Don\u2019t call me, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah! Look who grew a pair. I like the way you\u2019re standing up to me, girlfriend.\u201d Lucky patted me on the shoulder and sauntered toward the cash register. \u201cRing me up, sales girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErin, that scarf Ms. Carver has in her purse is one fifty. Add it to her bill.\u201d I smiled as Lucky narrowed her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s one hundred and fifty dollars, not large at all. And I am not your girlfriend.\u201d I walked into the back room and closed the door. Then I leaned against it. Lucky Carver. God, I hated that woman. She\u2019d called me \u201cgirlfriend\u201d and patted my shoulder with Erin as a witness. If Ray heard about that he\u2019d feel so betrayed. I had to get to him. But there would be no way to diffuse the rage he\u2019d feel when he realized she was here, close enough to kill.</p> <p>I dug my cell out of my purse and dialed his number. We exchanged pleasantries then I got down to business. Could he see me tonight?</p><p>\u201cGlory, babe, of course, come on over. Or do you want to meet me at N-V for a drink and dancing?\u201d He sounded sober and happy to hear from me.</p><p>\u201cThat would be fun another time but I have something serious to talk to you about.\u201d I cleared my throat when nerves seemed to close it. \u201cI\u2019ll be out there as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it about your meeting with the Storm God? You know I hired your old bodyguard Laurie. She didn\u2019t give me details, of course. She\u2019s discreet. But she did say you had a rough night when I asked her about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did. I\u2019ll tell you all when I get there.\u201d I ended the call and walked out the back door to my car parked in the alley. No need to get Ray stirred up about Lucky before I had a chance to tell him face-to-face. I dreaded this. But somehow I had to calm him down and get him to accept the fact that I wasn\u2019t betraying him by working with her. Hah! Now if I could just convince myself of that, it would be all good.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>When I stopped my car in front of Ray\u2019s house on a cliff overlooking one of Austin\u2019s lakes, I realized I\u2019d forgotten something important. I still wore those awful black clothes. I started to turn around and head home to change when he threw open his front door. He was barefoot, looking too delicious in low-riding jeans and a snug T-shirt that would have brought big bucks on the vintage-band rack in my shop.</p><p>\u201cAre you coming in or not?\u201d He grinned and loped over to my car. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Did you want to put on lipstick first?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a bad move.\u201d When he opened the car door, I took his hand and let him pull me out. Ray loping. It was just novel enough that I grabbed him and kissed his smile. \u201cYou are looking really, really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks. Can\u2019t say I can return the compliment.\u201d He checked me out from head to toe. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with the outfit? You look like a bag lady. And I know you like the top down but I have a feeling you didn\u2019t bother much with your hair tonight before the ride out here. Your cheeks are red too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Way to make a girl feel special, Ray.\u201d But since he was right, I just stepped away from him and spoke to Laurie who was hovering near his front door. After he shut it with her still on the outside, I turned to him. \u201cI\u2019m glad you hired Laurie. She\u2019s amazing. You sleep with her yet?\u201d I figured if he could be blunt, so could I.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t sleep with my bodyguards.\u201d He slung his arm around me. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry if I hurt your feelings, babe. Just hate that you\u2019re obviously bummed about something. Come in the living room and tell Ray all about it.\u201d</p><p>I leaned against him. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m bummed. Let me unload on you. You won\u2019t believe what the Storm God told me.\u201d I sank down on his leather couch so that I had a view of the lake. I knew far down below us there was probably a boat tied up at the dock; Ray always had one\u2014a real go-fast. Lights twinkled in the distance along the edges of the large expanse of water and it was a dreamy setting. I turned to Ray as he settled beside me and I gave him a dramatic version of the whole tale.</p><p>\u201cSounds like you\u2019re well out of that Siren scene. Not surprised Aggie\u2019s killed that many men. She\u2019s exactly what I thought she was\u2014a stone-cold bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I sort of feel sorry for her now. She\u2019s got to keep serving that guy. And has been at his beck and call for over a thousand years. Imagine, Ray.\u201d I sighed as he rubbed the back of my neck where my muscles were tied in knots.</p><p>\u201cRather not.\u201d He turned me so he could work the kinks out. \u201cRelax, babe. You are so stressed. And no wonder. What did Blade think of this? And Valdez?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get to them in a minute.\u201d I gave him a blow-by-blow of Achy tossing around lightning bolts and Circe\u2019s appearance, along with the bombshell she\u2019d dropped about Jerry and how we\u2019d met.</p><p>Ray\u2019s magic hands had relaxed me to the point that I\u2019d gone along when he\u2019d coaxed me into lying on my stomach. Now his hands stilled and he pressed a kiss on the back of my neck. \u201cYou\u2019re shittin\u2019 me. She set Blade up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d My voice wobbled but I sucked up the urge to cry.</p><p>\u201cGuess he didn\u2019t take it well.\u201d Ray\u2019s hands started moving over my body again.</p><p>\u201cYou could say that.\u201d I sighed as his hands eased aches I hadn\u2019t realized I had. \u201cJerry\u2019s gone to Castle Campbell in Scotland. Enough said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweet thing.\u201d Ray\u2019s deep voice was close and he nuzzled my ear with his lips before he continued easing every taut muscle in my back.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I rested my heavy head on my hands, getting more relaxed by the moment. \u201cMmm. You know you could get a job doing this.\u201d I actually yawned.</p><p>\u201cRecord sales tank, I\u2019ll keep it in mind.\u201d Ray\u2019s fingers wandered to new territory that I knew was more erogenous zone than tight muscle. \u201cWhat are you going to do about it? About Blade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we change the subject?\u201d I started to steer his hand away from the naughty direction it was taking but it felt too good. \u201cI\u2019m sick of my own drama. Tell me what you\u2019ve been up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStaying sober, though it hasn\u2019t been easy. But I have to admit I got scared straight.\u201d Now both his hands were getting a little too bold. Sue me, but they felt good enough that I swallowed any objections and let Ray have his way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean? That fall from the concert stage do it? You seemed to laugh that off at the time.\u201d So much for relaxation. I\u2019d been there, watching Ray trying to entertain thousands even though he was staggering drunk. Unfortunately he\u2019d lost his balance and taken a header into the audience. I shuddered as I remembered him lying unconscious on the concrete. Ray rolled me over to face him.</p><p>\u201cNo, Glory girl. You\u2019d think that night would have done it, humiliating myself in front of my fans. But it took something even worse to get my head on straight.\u201d Ray ran his hands down my legs then up, my skirt sliding up too. \u201cI really played the dumbass this time. You know how I love my daylight drug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sure.\u201d I tried to sit up but he pushed me down with a gentle hand on my shoulder. \u201cWhat the hell did you do, Ray?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease relax. I never should have started this story.\u201d He smoothed his hands up from my ankles. \u201cPoor baby, your calf muscles are really tight. Work in the shop tonight? On your feet a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome.\u201d Ray\u2019s fingers were firm yet gentle as they eased ever higher and my eyes started to drift closed even though I really wanted to know...</p><p>\u201cDid you watch a sunrise?\u201d My eyes fluttered open when Ray\u2019s hands reached my thighs and I put my hand over his. \u201cYou didn\u2019t stay outside too long, did you, Ray?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting to that part.\u201d He laid my hand back on my stomach then lifted one of my legs and bent it at the knee, still gently massaging. At least I\u2019d shaved my legs the night before. \u201cI sat there, drinking the blood with alcohol\u2014sorry, but it\u2019s a poor substitute for Jack\u2014and thought I\u2019d take another hit of the daylight drug. I figured what could it hurt? Stay out a little longer. You know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were under cover, weren\u2019t you? Or inside, looking out a window?\u201d I couldn\u2019t just lie there when he was obviously building up to something. When he abandoned my skirt to reach for my waist, I grabbed his hands again. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring me, Ray.\u201d</p> <p>His smile was rueful. \u201cDamn. Am I killing the mood here?\u201d Our waistline tug-of-war had moved under my sweater. I couldn\u2019t deny I loved his hands on me and I was really regretting that raggedy bra I\u2019d worn.</p><p>\u201cForget the mood for a moment. What happened, Ray?\u201d I touched his cheek and he pressed a kiss to my palm then scraped it with his fangs. \u201cWait. Don\u2019t tell me. Show me. This is a Siren trick that Aggie used on me. Let me see if I can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Ray looked puzzled when I grabbed both of his hands again.</p><p>\u201cJust remember what happened. The scene, exactly as it was. It will be like I\u2019m watching a movie if this works. Will you do that for me?\u201d I wasn\u2019t really sure I wanted to do this, but had to try. Ray and his daylight. The man was such an addict. Though he didn\u2019t want to hear that.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He gripped my hands and closed his eyes.</p><p>I closed mine and suddenly I could see Ray leaning against the cool glass of the French doors when the sky started to glow on the horizon. He had a full drink in his hand and I could actually smell the alcohol in the blood, taste it as he took a deep swallow. God, but he loved this time of day. The way the sun began to streak across the water. It was cold and clear and he could just glimpse the bow of his boat down at the dock.</p> <p>He felt the death sleep pulling at him. No. Shit. He wasn\u2019t going to give in. He reached in his pocket and pulled out the packet to take another hit. There. That should give him a half hour. The sky was actually pink now. He wanted to smell it, feel it on his skin. The wind would be laying off now, not a bit of breeze, and the quiet would be peaceful, like God was taking it all in. The beauty of his creation.</p><p>Damn it, his glass was empty. He snagged a fresh bottle out of the minifridge and didn\u2019t bother with the glass, just chugged it. What the fuck. He was going for it. The sunlight was starting to shimmer on the water which was smooth as glass. He had to be there. Take the boat out. If he fried, who the hell would miss him? And it wouldn\u2019t be a bad way to go.</p><p>He opened the door, stepped outside and felt the burn start. One inhale, that\u2019s all he got, when strong arms wrestled him back inside. Damn it, who paid these people? They worked for him. If he wanted to go for a boat ride, they could just step aside, let him go up in flames, by God.</p><p>But they just ignored him, knocking him down on his own fucking rug when he tried to get past them. He was firing every one of them. See if he didn\u2019t. Except he couldn\u2019t focus enough to see who the hell had him now. Who dropped him on his king-size bed and stripped him down to his boxers.</p><p>Death sleep. Shit. Missed another day.</p><p>\u201cIan had always warned me not to mix the daylight drug with alcohol but I didn\u2019t listen.\u201d Ray\u2019s voice was husky as he stretched out next to me, his hip bumping into mine. His breath stirred my hair and his scent surrounded me.</p><p>\u201cI almost lost you, Ray. I can\u2019t believe you did that.\u201d I stared into his eyes. They were kind, intent and, yes, beautiful. I wanted to drown in them. They were like crystal lakes that the Siren in me would have floated in, reveling in the sheer beauty of the clear water that reflected the perfect blue of a summer sky. I couldn\u2019t cry, actually wanted to shake him, hit him, wake him up to his value.</p><p>\u201cThe sun, Glory. You know how I am about the sun. I just had to feel it on my skin. I wanted it so damned bad.\u201d Ray brushed my hair back from my face, his fingers sliding gently over my forehead.</p> <p>I looked away, sick at how close I\u2019d come to losing him. I focused on one of his dark curls caught in the neck of his black T-shirt to keep from crying. He needed some tough love, not me begging him to live. \u201cLucky for you someone saved your sorry ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, seems Nate had given the guards orders. They\u2019re my babysitters too.\u201d Ray nuzzled my forehead with his chin. \u201cYou mad at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you learned your lesson.\u201d I shuddered and slid my hands up to his shoulders. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t ever do that again, Ray. Mix daylight and alcohol.\u201d Oh, shit, I was afraid I was going to cry after all.</p><p>\u201cI swear it. I was a damned fool. I\u2019m off the alcohol. If I have to choose between them, seeing the sunrise beats the hell out of the pitiful buzz that high-octane blood gives me.\u201d Ray gathered me in his arms and rocked me against his hard chest. \u201cAdmit it, Glory, all your men are stupid bastards. You deserve better.\u201d He held me tight as I finally let loose and cried against his soft cotton shirt.</p><p>I grabbed fistfuls of the cotton and held on then threw one leg over his. I felt Ray\u2019s desire behind the zipper in his dark-wash jeans. Had all his kindness just been foreplay? With Ray, it didn\u2019t take much to get his motor running. And of course he was another one of my Siren victims. This bitter thought just made my tears flow faster. He ran his bare toes up and down my calf in a gesture of comfort. Surprisingly it did make me feel better, that and his strong arms surrounding me. I held on to him as I realized that and rubbed my cheek against his firm bicep.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just as enchanted by the damned Siren thing as Jerry and Rafe are, Ray. You don\u2019t have a snowball\u2019s chance of getting out from under my spell.\u201d I sniffed and leaned back to look up at him. To my surprise he grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou are so very wrong, sweet thing. But aren\u2019t you adorable for trying to talk me out of making this move?\u201d He wiped my eyes with his palm then leaned down and kissed me. It was one of his soul-taking, give-me-all-that-you\u2019ve-got kisses.</p><p>I\u2019m no fool. I sank into him and let it happen. He tasted great and knew how to work with what he had, which was quite a lot. His hand came down to my backside to press me against him and I moaned into his mouth. Now who was weaving a spell? I gasped and pushed back.</p><p>\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is and way overdue. Listen to me.\u201d Ray brushed my wild hair back behind my ears. \u201cYour blood is in me, courtesy of that bitch Lucky Carver.\u201d</p><p>I looked away, not about to let him see how much I didn\u2019t want her name brought up right now. My news about her would end what was proving to be a welcome distraction from all the angst I\u2019d been feeling lately.</p><p>\u201cYes, she has my blood. And I guess it probably has some Siren characteristics.\u201d I closed my eyes again when Ray slid his hand under my skirt and squeezed my hip. My eyes popped open. Panties. What the hell kind of panties had I put on this evening? Black thong. Okay. Not so bad.</p><p>\u201cPossibly. I let Ian check my blood when he was doing all his tests. Seems my blood is very similar to yours. So if you have Siren blood, then so do I.\u201d He nibbled on my earlobe then grazed my skin with his fangs, clearly on a path to my jugular. \u201cIf anyone can resist your call, lady, it would be me.\u201d He kissed my pulsing vein for a breathless moment. \u201cAnd I hate to burst your bubble, sweet thing, but, when I was in L.A., I hardly gave you a thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally, Ray?\u201d I shoved my hands into his hair and tugged until he looked me in the eyes. \u201cI want to read your mind. Will you trust me enough to let me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. If I\u2019m lyin\u2019, I\u2019m dyin\u2019.\u201d He grinned and opened those laser blues wide.</p><p>I sought the answers I wanted and found them. Seriously. I saw him with a leggy blonde, a vampire who\u2019d showed him how getting his fangs involved made sex hotter than hot. He\u2019d called it popping his vamp cherry. I felt the heat rise in my cheeks and swatted his shoulder. Then there were a variety of groupies, fans who always hung around the band and would do anything to say they\u2019d scored with a famous rock star. Those scenes made me curl my lip, especially when I saw he\u2019d used them for a taste of human blood then wiped their minds clean after the fact. Had I been anywhere in his thoughts in L.A.? I shoved him off the couch.</p><p>\u201cFine. You\u2019re a dog and not the tail-wagging kind\u2014obviously not one of my victims.\u201d I sighed, then realized how ridiculous that sounded. I offered him my hand, matching his unrepentant grin with a smile.</p><p>\u201cKeep looking, babe. There\u2019s something else in my head for you to see besides my sheet action.\u201d Ray was solemn now and didn\u2019t that make me shiver. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a heart attack.\u201d He settled half on top of me, his body fitting in a way I wanted to arch into. I resisted, still not convinced this was a good idea. \u201cLook into my mind.\u201d He stared down, intense, his thoughts very open now.</p><p>I did see more there. I saw the Ray who had woken up lost and confused, the man who totally understood what I was going through now. Who got that suddenly not knowing who or what you were shook your world until you weren\u2019t sure if you could even live there anymore.</p> <p>At least he\u2019d been lucky. He\u2019d had an angel by his side after he got over the initial shock, someone he could count on to guide him through this new life that he had to live in the dark. It wasn\u2019t a magic spell or even gratitude that made him want to hold me and comfort me. No, he just wanted to be there for me, like I\u2019d been there for him. Yeah, he was new to this vampire gig, but he\u2019d love a chance to be my anchor for a change. Did I trust him enough to let him try?</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ray. Yeah, I trust you.\u201d I pulled his mouth down to mine again. Our kiss was something special. I let him know that it meant a lot to me that he wanted to help me. That we were both survivors and maybe it was right that we were here together tonight. And if I was a Siren, then there was one surefire way a Siren knew to celebrate life.</p><p>Ray pulled back and grinned. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me twice, Glory girl.\u201d He drew my sweater up and off to toss it across the room.</p><p>\u201cFancy underwear.\u201d He laughed when he saw my bra and I hit him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t plan to let anyone else see it when I got dressed this evening.\u201d I tried to cover what even Goodwill would have rejected.</p> <p>\u201cThen we\u2019d better get it off fast.\u201d He quickly unhooked the back and ripped it off me, then turned and aimed for a small trash can. It hit with a clang, falling half out of it like a sad flag of surrender. \u201cYou will let it stay there, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d I reached for him again, shivering as he kissed a path from one nipple to the other. He traced an erotic journey with his fangs then drew on each peak until I shuddered and almost tore his shirt off in my eagerness to get his chest bare to my touch.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to stop me this time, are you, babe?\u201d He had his hand on the waistband of my skirt, ready to send it to my feet.</p><p>I knew as well as he did that we\u2019d been to this point before and I\u2019d called a halt. It wasn\u2019t fair or kind to keep doing this. I did a gut check. Jerry was gone, abandoning me without a thought to how I was dealing with the news of what I was. He\u2019d just taken off and never looked back. Was that love? I\u2019d told Rafe to move on and I\u2019d meant it. I didn\u2019t want to ruin his life by holding him with a spell. What did that leave for Glory? An empty apartment and a hot guy who wanted her.</p><p>Ray understood what I was feeling too. That peek into his mind had resonated like nothing else could. We\u2019d both had our very foundations rocked. He\u2019d turned to alcohol and a search for oblivion. Was I turning to meaningless sex? I met his gaze and knew nothing with this man could ever be meaningless to me. We had a soul-deep connection that included friendship and a binding of our blood that would help us get through this together. I pushed my horrible skirt and thong down, kicking them away until all I wore were my boots.</p><p>\u201cAll systems go, captain. Let\u2019s blast off.\u201d I shoved him off the couch and onto the floor where I landed on top of him with a throaty laugh. After a long kiss that left us both breathless, I unbuttoned and unzipped his jeans and opened them wide.</p> <p>Oh, wow, did I remember this. Ray had always liked to strut his stuff in front of me when we\u2019d pretended to be engaged a few months ago. I\u2019d seen the piercing before and now it glittered with a diamond that just begged to be kissed. It jutted boldly from that open zipper and I leaned down to tease it with my tongue.</p><p>\u201cGlory.\u201d Ray groaned and reached for me.</p><p>\u201cNot here. With the windows uncovered? I bet Laurie does a regular walk around the perimeter. I don\u2019t want her for an audience.\u201d I glanced at that spectacular view outside then down to the one below me. I let my hair brush his erection and saw Ray shudder. Nice.</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t. But if we\u2019re playing spaceship or Star Trek, I have some, um, toys.\u201d Ray grinned up at me. \u201cI have this fantasy...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. I know. Yes, I saw a little of that when I was doing the mind sweep.\u201d I grabbed the hems of his jeans and jerked them off to fling them across the room. Then I stood and put my hands on my hips. When had I lost all my inhibitions? Sure I had figure flaws, but a handsome, man-of-my-dreams rock star wanted me. Lucky had gotten one thing right. The new vampire she\u2019d had dropped into my bed had been my fantasy man for a long while. Time to make that fantasy a reality. No tricks, no long-term complications. I\u2019d think about those other short-term issues later. For now, I was more than ready to have fun.</p><p>\u201cGame on. What about my boots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey look good. Keep \u2019em on, definitely. The launch pad is down the hall.\u201d Ray jumped to his feet and pulled me after him as he ran toward what I assumed was his bedroom. I laughed as I imagined what was in store for me. Ray did have a reputation. But, honey, when I saw what was in that room... The tabloids didn\u2019t have a clue.</p><p>\u201cWhat is this room?\u201d I stared around in wonder.</p> <p>\u201cMy playroom. I\u2019ve been collecting since I was a kid. Nate and I have an agreement not to bid on the same things or we end up jacking prices against each other online.\u201d Ray didn\u2019t seem to have any qualms about strolling around naked as he showed off his collection of comic books, Star Wars figures and everything to do with superheroes. I had a hard time concentrating on his toys when he was the main attraction as far as I was concerned.</p><p>\u201cIs this Captain Kirk\u2019s chair?\u201d I didn\u2019t dare sit in it naked but recognized it instantly.</p><p>\u201cAre you a Trekkie?\u201d Ray grinned. \u201cReproduction. Sit. It\u2019s okay. No, wait. Let me go first.\u201d He dropped into the chair then pulled me into his lap. \u201cNow that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>I snuggled my bottom against his eager erection. \u201cHmm. Seems like there could be a better way for me to sit than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. But not yet.\u201d He eased me off his lap. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take full advantage. Stand in the middle of the room.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I was self-conscious and grabbed what looked like one of Luke Skywalker\u2019s jackets and slipped it on. Ray hit a switch and the lights dimmed. I looked up and gasped. We were in an alternate universe with stars above us in a night sky projected on the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cThis is awesome.\u201d I loved the way the mysterious blue glow made everything seem more beautiful. Though Ray\u2019s body didn\u2019t need the help, it would definitely make it easier for me when I had to drop that robe.</p><p>\u201cWait for it.\u201d He hit another switch and soaring music filled the air. \u201cIt\u2019s a special remix Nate and I have been working and reworking since we were teenagers. You\u2019ll definitely recognize some of the tunes.\u201d</p><p>I was still caught up in the magic of the stars and sound when Ray slapped a lightsaber into my hand. He\u2019d donned a Darth Vader mask.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are we fighting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Want to see if you can score against me?\u201d Ray lightly tapped me on the hip, then used the saber to open that jacket. \u201cNude fighting is more fun. Getting shy on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. And I\u2019d like to see your face. Those creepy breathing sounds coming from your mask aren\u2019t sexy.\u201d I got in a few hits with my saber on his arm and hip.</p><p>\u201cThen I lose it.\u201d He carefully laid it on a shelf, then turned back. We did a few minutes of fake swordplay until he managed to knock my saber across the room. \u201cGotcha.\u201d He moved in and slid his hands under my jacket. \u201cMmm. I get a reward for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of reward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d He leaned in and kissed me breathless, shoving my jacket off at the same time. He finally eased back and looked me over. \u201cDid I ever tell you how much I love your breasts?\u201d He nuzzled each one of them, his thumbs pressing against my nipples. \u201cThe real deal. Man, I love the real deal.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, very grateful that I pleased him. Then I walked him back until he was sitting in that captain\u2019s chair. I\u2019d worked up a fantasy of my own.</p><p>\u201cNow I wonder, Captain. Will you let me take over the controls?\u201d I ran my hands down his chest, my mouth following.</p><p>\u201cIf you promise not to let us crash and burn.\u201d He leaned back, his legs spread. \u201cBut listen first. Glory, you have got to know that this Siren shit is stupid. You are quite a woman all on your own.\u201d He moaned when I licked my way up and down his cock. I stopped at the diamond ring piercing. Some devil made me grab that ring with my teeth and tug.</p><p>\u201cGod, yes, Glory.\u201d He slid his hands through my hair, eager to keep that going, but I released him and scooted out of reach and across the room.</p><p>I was very aware of his eyes on me. Ray made me feel sexy like... Wonder Woman? No, too obvious. So many of these superheroes were men. And Star Trek had featured very few women. There was a rack of their tiny minidresses in various colors but none of them were close to my size. Princess Leia. Ah. A sexy harem costume she\u2019d worn in one of the Star Wars movies. Seemed appropriate since I\u2019d escaped from a harem myself. But her tiny bra top was designed for hills, not my mountains. I finally settled on her headband and wore it like a crown.</p><p>Then I picked up a small whip with leather thongs a character from a comic must have used and hit it against my hand. I turned to face Ray and strutted toward him, stroking that whip lightly up and down my body. I figured it was a good distraction from my figure flaws.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Captain, are you certain you will allow me to control the ship and, um, you?\u201d I ran the whip down Ray\u2019s chest, teasing his nipples.</p><p>\u201cFor you, Leia? Of course.\u201d He grinned. \u201cCome closer and I\u2019ll be happy to do whatever you wish or I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll suffer the consequences.\u201d He nodded at the whip. I saw him swallow when I brushed the thongs across my breasts. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen you must obey my commands. Now kiss my breasts, only my breasts, and nothing else. And you will stop when I tell you to. Understand?\u201d I walked around him, the whip brushing his ear and my nipples grazing his biceps.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The word came out hoarse and I gave an evil laugh of triumph.</p><p>\u201cNow begin.\u201d I sat on his lap and presented one breast to his mouth. Ray attacked it like it was his only birthday gift. Oh, yeah. I braced a hand on his shoulder and tried not to moan as I felt the pull of his mouth all the way to my toes. I smacked his arm with my whip. \u201cNo hands. I did not say you could use your hands.\u201d He gripped the armrests like he was about to launch off the chair. I would have laughed but I was about to leap into the air myself.</p> <p>So I finally scrambled away, gathering my dignity and trying not to show how he\u2019d affected me. I stalked around the room, hitting my thigh with the whip until I changed directions. \u201cThe other breast now. Take care of it,\u201d I ordered, sitting in his lap again.</p><p>Who was I torturing? He latched on and I squeaked when he pierced me with his fangs. It was heavenly hell. His hand crept to my hip and I hit him again. \u201cBad boy. I said no hands.\u201d He actually obeyed me. We were really into this but I wasn\u2019t sure how much more I could take. His erection was rock hard against my hip, the diamond scratching me. I smelled fresh blood. Mine. I shoved his face away from my breast.</p><p>\u201cGlory,\u201d he groaned as he looked up at me, my blood smeared on his cheek.</p><p>\u201cQuiet. I am almost ready for liftoff, Captain.\u201d I wiped away the blood and stuck my finger in his mouth. He closed his eyes as he licked it clean. I slid off his knees and stood.</p><p>\u201cNow. Our destination is Orgasmis. Have you been there before?\u201d I eyed his cock when it jerked against his stomach.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but not with such a skilled crew. I\u2019m thinking it will be a short journey this time.\u201d He still held the arms of the chair as if afraid to let go.</p><p>I strode to the center of the room where I turned to face him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. I like long, slow trips with lots of sightseeing when I travel, Captain. I hope you will not disappoint me by rushing this. I want the scenic route.\u201d I reached between my thighs, slowly sliding the whip handle between them.</p><p>Ray watched my every move and I saw him swallow again. Was he finally going to give in and jump out of that chair? No, he stayed put but I could see the muscles in his arms quivering. I made a show of examining the damp handle.</p><p>\u201cWhy, I believe I am almost ready for departure.\u201d I sauntered up to Ray and waved the handle a few inches from his nose. \u201cWhat do you think, Captain? Are all systems go?\u201d His nostrils flared. \u201cShall I come on board?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, Glory. Let me taste you.\u201d His eyes narrowed on my hips hungrily.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps next trip. If this journey is to my liking.\u201d I tossed the whip aside, more eager for that ride than I wanted to let on. Surrounded by the scent of our arousal, I quivered with wanting him. I reached for his cock, desperate to feel it inside me. Games. I looked up into his eyes and grinned. Why not?</p> <p>\u201cIt will be to your liking, woman, or I will die trying.\u201d His voice was little more than a growl as I leaned closer and slid my knees alongside his. My breasts pressed against his chest and I gave him an openmouthed kiss that seemed to go on for decades. Finally, I leaned back.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m glad we\u2019re immortal.\u201d I picked up his hands and slid them around my waist. \u201cPrepare for boarding, Captain.\u201d Before I could say another word, he lifted me, giving me just enough time to grab the back of the chair and spread my legs to accommodate him before he settled me onto his lap. When I felt his cock finally glide into me, I couldn\u2019t bite back my moan of pleasure.</p><p>Oh, God, but it felt good. I spared a moment to wonder about that diamond but it only added another level of excitement, a new thrill that I savored as he filled me. My knees settled onto the leather seat on either side of his narrow hips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Move.\u201d Ray put his hands on my face and stared into my eyes. \u201cLook at me and listen. You are an incredible, amazing woman, Gloriana St. Clair. And I want you to know that I have never brought another woman here, to my playroom. Do you believe me?\u201d</p><p>I stared back, for a moment utterly speechless. From Ray, this was about as serious as it got. I was in the inner sanctum. And speaking of... I could feel him throbbing inside me, the pleasure intense but not nearly there yet. I wanted to move, to scream, to...</p><p>\u201cUh, yes, and thanks, Ray. Now, please, kiss me?\u201d I grabbed his hair and held on as I fit my mouth to his. Oh, but I loved him. Ray was so much more than a man with a golden voice that could melt me. He was caring and charismatic and larger than life. He made me feel beautiful and worthy and, oh God, he began to move. I squeezed my inner muscles, holding him tight. He groaned and held my head to kiss me deeper, surer, as if he couldn\u2019t get enough of me. The chair creaked and I wondered if it would be able to handle what we were about to do in it. I grabbed the leather back again.</p><p>\u201cPreparing for liftoff.\u201d Ray grinned and held my hips as he pounded into me. \u201cAccelerating.\u201d He must have seen my eyes glazing over and my face flushing as an orgasm shivered and shuddered through me. \u201cDestination in sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay, oh, please.\u201d I leaned down and took his vein. Just couldn\u2019t help myself. It was part of the action and he obviously expected it. The music soared along with Ray\u2019s rhythm, bringing me closer and closer to a climax that was pulling me apart and yet putting me back together again. His hands tightened and I felt such a screaming wonderful wildness inside me that I never wanted it to stop.</p> <p>With a clash of cymbals, pounding of drums and a trumpet\u2019s blast, Ray shouted my name and drove into me a final time. He held the back of my head while I drank greedily. When I finally licked away the fang marks, he plucked the crown from my head and tossed it away.</p><p>\u201cI believe we have arrived safely, Princess.\u201d He ran his hand down my back. \u201cAre you satisfied with the captain\u2019s performance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Yes. This time.\u201d I sat up. My body quivered around him, and I had to steady myself as I clasped Ray between my knees. I looked up at the galaxies on display above our heads. I had a new respect for that chair and would certainly never hear the theme from Star Wars again without getting a new kind of thrill. Of course, as a vampire, Ray could keep doing this all night long and was already stirring inside me.</p><p>\u201cThis time? Are you saying you would like another trip?\u201d Ray dropped a kiss on the tip of each breast and I shivered.</p><p>\u201cHmm. It\u2019s entirely possible. I may require more demonstrations to be sure that you are competent in all maneuvers when handling\u201d\u2014I walked my fingers down his chest\u2014\u201cspace travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be more than happy to let you try out all my various techniques.\u201d Ray jumped to his feet and carried me down the hall. \u201cBut first you need to see how we welcome guests to Orgasmis. My shower is a double and equipped with showerheads designed to add pleasure to your bathing experience. Conquering other galaxies can be sweaty work. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>I relaxed against him. \u201cI think you\u2019re amazing. Thanks, Ray. You definitely took my mind off my troubles.\u201d</p><p>He stopped in the doorway of a massive master suite. \u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome.\u201d He kissed me, a sweet, subtly erotic kiss. \u201cHow many times have you brought me back from the brink of something ugly? I\u2019m happy to help. And you know it wasn\u2019t exactly a sacrifice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m another notch on that famous bedpost.\u201d I nodded toward the king-size bed facing a pair of French doors with another great lake view.</p><p>\u201cNever, ever think you are on that list.\u201d Ray slid me to my feet. \u201cDamn it, Glory. You\u2019re special to me. Don\u2019t you dare put yourself down like that. I\u2019d kill anyone else who tried to say such things about you.\u201d</p><p>I saw that he meant it and bit my lip. \u201cYeah, I get that. Sorry. Give me some time to get used to this. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabe, you can have all the time you need. Just don\u2019t run home and start spouting nonsense about how this was all a big mistake. I won\u2019t have it. You hear me?\u201d Ray took my elbow and marched me into the bathroom. \u201cNow I don\u2019t know about you, but I need a shower. I\u2019ve got shower gel and fancy shampoos in whatever flavor and scent strikes your fancy. Knock yourself out. I\u2019m going to run give Laurie her orders for the rest of the night before I join you. Are we cool?\u201d Ray stared at me, waiting.</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re cool and very, very hot.\u201d I touched his cheek and kissed his lips. \u201cGo, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I sat down to take off my boots while he stepped into a pair of running shorts. My thoughts were in a whirl. He had said exactly what I\u2019d been thinking even though I\u2019d been careful to block my thoughts.</p><p>Relax, Glory. I was still quivering from a world-class orgasm and I\u2019d be damned if I\u2019d ruin this night with worry. My favorite fantasy was becoming reality. Ray had rocked my world. I owed it to myself and to him to savor every moment.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>I was rinsing off my hair when Ray joined me in that fabulous shower stall. The glass tiles were the color of the sea. Seemed like since I\u2019d found out about my Siren connection I was seeing water everywhere. Were latent memories coming back or was it my imagination? Aggie and I needed to talk. But so did Ray and I. Of course talk wasn\u2019t on the agenda when he slid his arms around me. Ray\u2019s idea of a shower was less about getting clean and more about seeing how many ways he could take me in that stall. Finally, as I collapsed against the tile for the fourth time, I called a halt.</p><p>\u201cSiren or not. I feel the dawn coming and the urge for a dry bed.\u201d</p><p>Ray glanced at his waterproof watch. \u201cPlenty of time left before the sun comes up. Or we could take some daylight drug and watch it rise. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d I smiled at the thought of a sunrise in his arms. \u201cCan we slow down a little, rock star?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I won\u2019t say no to moving this to my king-size bed.\u201d Ray handed me a tiny towel that couldn\u2019t possibly go around me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wrapped it around my hair and grabbed a bath sheet to tie around my body. \u201cYou\u2019re insatiable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s our Siren blood.\u201d Ray ran a comb through his wet hair. After blotting a towel over his body, he hadn\u2019t bothered to cover it. Which was fine by me. He turned to me and slipped open the knot between my breasts. \u201cI have a theory about this Siren stuff. I think we really are all that when it comes to sex.\u201d</p><p>I brushed a strand of wet hair back from his beautiful face. \u201cVampires are sensual creatures too, Ray. At least every vamp I\u2019ve met is highly charged sexually. Well, except for a few Energy Vampires. They seem to get off to power more than sex.\u201d I probably should tell him what Ian had said about my blood, our blood.</p> <p>\u201cI think what we have is more than the vamp thing. We\u2019ve got to get with Aggie, much as I hate her, and see what she\u2019s got to say about Sirens. There are bound to be powers there too. Things we can use to our advantage.\u201d He got the towel away from me and pulled me against him. What can I say? He felt damned good and I felt damned easy.</p><p>\u201cWell, I can turn people to statues. That\u2019s one. And Alesa hinted that I might be able to blast through mental blocks.\u201d I hated sharing that one but my defenses were down, especially with Ray doing interesting things with his hands. Reading thoughts... If Ray could blast through mine... No, not thinking about Lucky now. Sex. Fabulous sex in his bed just a few feet away. Thinking about that.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. We\u2019ll have to explore that. Later.\u201d Ray dropped to his knees in front of me.</p><p>\u201cRay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax, Glory. Put yourself in my hands.\u201d He nudged my legs apart.</p> <p>Well, what woman would say no to that?</p><p>I woke up to music. I stretched and realized I was naked in Ray\u2019s king-size bed. It wasn\u2019t a recording I was listening to but Ray at his piano singing a new song. I liked it. It was optimistic and upbeat, the kind of music he hadn\u2019t written for a long time. I found my sweater and skirt on the foot of the bed. No underwear. Oh, well. I pulled them on, used a new toothbrush and toothpaste I found in the bathroom and attempted some order with my hair, then padded out to the living room.</p><p>Ray sat at the grand piano. I knew my time was up. I was going to have to tell him about Lucky and my deal with her. I was really, really dreading it. I wanted to run, throw up, something. Instead, I firmed my resolve even though my knees were so watery I had to hold on to the piano when I got there.</p><p>\u201cCome. Sit. Tell me what you think.\u201d Ray grinned and patted the piano bench next to him. He wore silk boxers and nothing else, the rest of his beautiful body a great distraction. Guess lots of hot sex will do that to you. Make you crave more. For a moment it actually took my mind off what was coming.</p><p>\u201cThe song? What I\u2019ve heard so far is fantastic. Very catchy chorus. I can imagine dancing to it in a club.\u201d I sat and listened while he pounded out a rock beat and sang in the voice that had made me fall for him long before I\u2019d ever met the man behind it. Seeing him full of joy, belting out a tune that he ended with a grin and a flourish made me lean against him, tears burning my eyes. I knew what my news would do to that great mood.</p><p>\u201cStill needs some work. The end isn\u2019t right yet.\u201d He wrote something on the sheet music in front of him.</p> <p>\u201cSounded perfect to me.\u201d I sniffled, couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cThanks, babe. Lucky for me you\u2019ve always been a fan.\u201d He took my face into his hands and gave me a sweet kiss, the kind that could melt your bones.</p><p>\u201cRay\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. I\u2019ve got something to say. This Siren thing. It\u2019s really bugging me. Come sit beside me on the couch.\u201d He pulled me up and led me there, catching me when I stumbled. He looked uncharacteristically serious.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it? I know Aggie\u2019s a bitch but I hope I won\u2019t suddenly start acting like her now just because I know...\u201d I sat and he settled beside me.</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that. You were once a Siren, Glory. You had a song, a beautiful captivating voice. You could lure men to their deaths with its beauty.\u201d Ray\u2019s eyes became a little unfocused and I could see that the artist in him was trying to imagine it. He shook his head. \u201cAnd that bastard Storm God ripped it out of you.\u201d He pulled me into his arms and rested his cheek on my hair. \u201cGod, baby, it\u2019s a fucking tragedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay.\u201d I patted his back, comforting him. \u201cThank you. But I really don\u2019t remember any of it. And, seriously? Who would want the kind of song that made men willing to die for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a misuse of talent. It wouldn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d Ray held me tight.</p> <p>\u201cI guess. But don\u2019t worry about me. I listen to your voice and it moves me. Music and your kind of talent means the world to me. But I simply can\u2019t imagine having it inside myself.\u201d</p><p>Ray pulled back, his eyes actually shimmering, like the emotions were getting to him. \u201cBabe, that\u2019s what\u2019s so criminal about this. You were robbed.\u201d He smoothed back my hair. \u201cAnd taken from the sea too. I\u2019ve seen Aggie swim, savoring the water on her like she was born to be there. Which I guess she was. You lost all that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Now, when I\u2019m in that lake out there, I choke, terrified of what might grab me and pull me under.\u201d I finally got it and anger shook loose inside me until I wanted to pound something. Not that it would do me any good. Ancient history. \u201cDamn Achelous to hell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go. Get good and mad.\u201d Ray held me again and whispered in my ear. \u201cI wish there was something I could do to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me something.\u201d My stomach knotted. The time had come and I knew I couldn\u2019t put this off.</p><p>\u201cSure, anything.\u201d He leaned back. \u201cMusic lessons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that ship has sailed.\u201d I rubbed his cheek with my thumb. I hate, hate, hated what I was about to say. \u201cJust listen and don\u2019t go off on me. Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019ve got me worried.\u201d He captured my hand. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night was great but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start.\u201d Ray frowned, dropped my hand and jumped to his feet. \u201cHere we go. I knew you were going to pull this. Forget Blade and Rafe and all the crap that you always drag out as reasons why you and I can\u2019t work. I\u2019m not proposing marriage. Can\u2019t we just enjoy ourselves for a while? No strings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it, though I\u2019m tangled up in a bunch of strings you don\u2019t know about, Ray.\u201d I spied my boots next to the coffee table and began to pull them on. I couldn\u2019t believe he thought I regretted last night. As if any woman could.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll cut through them, together. Tell me what they are.\u201d Ray sat beside me again.</p><p>\u201cI have something to tell you, Ray. Something I should have spit out when I first got here. But then things got going between us and it was great. Really. Better than great. I\u2019m not sorry it happened, not at all. But when you hear what I have to say...\u201d I zipped up the last boot to stall for time then pressed my fists to my rolling stomach. If I got through this without throwing up it would be a freaking miracle.</p><p>\u201cHow bad can it be?\u201d Ray was smiling again, his hand on my shoulder. \u201cCome on, babe. Just get it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky Carver is in town.\u201d There, I\u2019d said it. And Ray reacted as predicted.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you say. What is that bitch doing here?\u201d He jumped to his feet and stalked over to the French doors. He flung one open. \u201cLaurie, come here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, boss?\u201d She was there on the run.</p><p>\u201cPass the word to the other guards. There\u2019s an old enemy of mine in town.\u201d Ray glanced at me. \u201cWhat color is her hair now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call it mahogany. It\u2019s a dark red. Laurie, she\u2019s of Italian descent, about my height, size six and looks midthirties but is a decade older. A loan shark named Lucky Carver. I told her to stay away from you, Ray.\u201d I locked eyes with Laurie. \u201cI want to get with you sometime. To talk to you about what went down at the meeting with Circe and Achelous. When is your night off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow. N-V? Ten?\u201d She looked from me to Ray and back again.</p><p>\u201cMake it my place, say at eight?\u201d I glanced at Ray. He was pacing the living room, about to freak because obviously I\u2019d had a conversation with Lucky and had been reluctant to tell him about it.</p><p>\u201cSure, we can do that.\u201d Laurie nodded. \u201cSee you then. Anything else, boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of that woman. Far from it. But if she shows up here, she\u2019s not to get past the gate.\u201d Ray waved Laurie off then turned to me. \u201cSo you\u2019ve talked to Lucky. When were you going to tell me about it? Oh, wait. Guess that would have ruined the mood for sex. Smart move, Siren.\u201d He faced me, an angry man.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come here for sex, Ray. That was your idea. You were the one who started all the touching with the massage routine.\u201d Hey, I could get mad too. I jumped up, hands on my hips. \u201cDon\u2019t keep throwing that Siren crap in my face. Lucky came to see me in the shop. I wanted to toss her out on her ass. I hate that freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both. So did you? Toss her out after warning her to stay away from me?\u201d Ray grabbed my elbow.</p><p>I\u2019ll be damned if he wasn\u2019t trying to read my mind. Then I felt him trying to blast through my block. Siren wannabe. No way in hell.</p><p>\u201cStop it! You aren\u2019t a damned Siren. Quit trying to play mind games with me. I talked to her. I\u2019m her sire. Which she tried to use to get to me. I had her tossed out of Austin before without any guidance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of what she did to me, Glory!\u201d Ray shook my arm, then realized he was on the verge of violence and took a step back. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t hurt women. Not that it stops them from hurting me. Case in point\u2014Lucky Carver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Ray. I made it clear to her that what she did was unforgivable. That the council would put her down if she did something like that now.\u201d Oh, God, was there any way I could make this deal with Lucky sound like something other than disloyalty? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn right they would.\u201d Ray ran a hand through his hair. It was the same gesture Jerry made when he was agitated. No, couldn\u2019t think about him now.</p><p>\u201cShe was contacted by Ian about our blood. Since I sired her, she really does have my Siren blood. Some crone in Transylvania took one whiff and told her it\u2019s special. Then Ian let her know there\u2019s something hinky going on with her blood too. She\u2019s desperate to get the goods on it.\u201d I reached for Ray but he stepped back. \u201cI feel like maybe I owe her an explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You owe that bitch something? I owe her too. A stake through her black heart.\u201d Ray walked over to the piano and slammed the lid shut, the noise making me jump. \u201cDamn it, Glory, if you help that woman, I will take it as a personal betrayal.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t look at me but stared out at the lake where a speedboat roared across the dark water.</p> <p>\u201cRay.\u201d I fought back the urge to cry. He was right. I couldn\u2019t make any kind of deal with Lucky. I was tearing up her check. Letting her know I wasn\u2019t honoring her stupid contract. What could she do about it? Do to me? Yes, she had thugs, but I wasn\u2019t about to be intimidated into anything. I had powers now. And I\u2019d go to the vampire council for help if I had to. They didn\u2019t like loan sharks hanging out in Austin.</p><p>\u201cSo are you? Going to help Lucky?\u201d Ray finally turned around and walked over to look me right in the eye.</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t do that to you, Ray. I wish now I\u2019d had a stake in my hands when she came to see me. She caught me off guard or I\u2019d never...\u201d I slid my arms around him and held on. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. That I was tempted for even a moment to take her money.\u201d</p><p>He shoved me away and stared at me. \u201cShe offered you money? Why? To be her mentor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d I wanted to cut off my own unruly tongue. Why had I said that?</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you need money? Is the shop in trouble?\u201d Ray kept his distance.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s doing okay.\u201d I wanted to be honest with him. I owed Ray that much. \u201cI was, uh, thinking about going to Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, shit. Of course. To chase after Blade.\u201d Ray\u2019s bitter laugh pierced my heart. \u201cWhy the hell not? You afraid the Siren whammy isn\u2019t strong enough to pull him back across an ocean and half a continent, Glory girl?\u201d He stalked across the room and pulled out a bottle of synthetic blood from the small fridge in the bar. He drained it, then threw the bottle against the wall where it shattered. \u201cFuck. When will I ever learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was before last night, Ray. I would never do that now. Not after we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it. Now you\u2019ve got the guilts. Can\u2019t go crawling to Blade with me on your conscience.\u201d Ray picked up his cell phone from the coffee table and hit speed dial. \u201cI need a delivery. The special blend. Yeah, I\u2019m sure. Don\u2019t give me a speech, just do it.\u201d He hung up and tossed the phone onto a cushioned chair. \u201cNow, where were we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just do, Ray?\u201d I ran over and grabbed his phone. I hit redial. \u201cWho is this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Damian. Who is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, Damian. What did Ray just order?\u201d I knew Damian supplied many vampires with high-end synthetic blood, not the cheap stuff I ordered on the Internet.</p><p>\u201cThe blood with alcohol, Glory. I tried to talk him out of it.\u201d Damian sighed. \u201cI know his history. My sister asked me not to fill his orders again. But I am a businessman. You should understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. Go ahead. I\u2019m not his mother.\u201d I ended the call then threw the phone against the same wall the bottle had crashed against. \u201cYou fucking idiot! Is that language you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Glory, I believe that\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard you use that word.\u201d Ray just grinned and sat on the couch like he didn\u2019t care that he\u2019d just shattered my heart along with that bottle. \u201cBet it won\u2019t be the last. And, no, you\u2019re not my mother. As last night proved, in spades.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard. Fool. What do I have to do to get you to treat yourself right?\u201d I sat beside him and buried my face in my skirt. His hand landed on my back.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Kill Lucky for me?\u201d</p><p>I jerked as if he\u2019d taken a stake to me. I knew he wasn\u2019t kidding. I sat up and faced him. \u201cI don\u2019t kill people. Not now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNeither do I. Or I didn\u2019t until now. But I wouldn\u2019t shed a tear if Lucky fell on a stake.\u201d Ray leaned back and stared at me, his eyes hard now with no sign of the lover in them. \u201cSeriously, something needs to be done. Justice, that\u2019s what I\u2019m after. She can\u2019t get away with what she did to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we could call it murder. She killed you, then brought you back to this life you hate so much.\u201d I put my hand on his bare knee. At least he didn\u2019t slap it away. \u201cI told her that. Let her know I despised her for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure that broke her heart.\u201d Ray put his hand over mine and gripped it. \u201cDamn it, Glory, you know she\u2019s been gloating about it since then. That she stole my daylight. She knew exactly how important that part of my life was to me, even back then. We spent hours at the beach the summer I thought I was in love with her.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI can use the excuse that I was young, a kid. But hooking up with Lucky Carver was the biggest mistake of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure paid for it.\u201d I hated for Ray to relive that mess with Lucky. And it was just the kind of trigger to get him back on the alcohol. Even one drink could start him on a spiral that could quickly get out of control. His buddy Nate and I had both done our best to watch him when he went on one of his benders before. But he was right\u2014I wasn\u2019t his mother. And Nate wasn\u2019t his father.</p><p>Ray had to decide for himself that life was worth living. But with the alcohol in his system, he had no judgment. I kept imagining him staggering outside again when the sun came up. I squeezed his hand and let him see how terrified I was for him.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want me to get into the alcohol again, do you?\u201d Ray pinned me with a sharp gaze.</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t control it. You know as well as I do that you\u2019re an addict. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but it\u2019s the truth as I see it.\u201d I wasn\u2019t about to break eye contact and was glad to see that he was really listening, not already thinking about the drink coming his way. Of course I read his mind, there was a lot riding on the next few moments. \u201cYou\u2019re healthier and happier when you\u2019re off the sauce. That song you\u2019ve been working on? No way could you have produced genius like that under the influence.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, thinking I hoped. I cut him a break and left him to his thoughts. When he finally opened his eyes again I saw resignation and I put my hand on his leg again.</p><p>\u201cRay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I cancel that order, it\u2019s because I want to, not because you told me to.\u201d His mouth quirked, like he was trying not to smile. \u201cYou broke my phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can borrow mine.\u201d I grabbed my purse off the coffee table and dug my cell out. \u201cDamian\u2019s number is in there.\u201d My hand shook as I held it out to him.</p><p>\u201cHow about a reward?\u201d Ray glanced at the phone then at me, his eyes taking a leisurely path down my body. \u201cFor taking your advice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat could be arranged.\u201d I slid my hand up his bare leg and inside the hem of those shorts. I ran a fingertip along his firming interest in my proposition.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t suppose you\u2019d play first?\u201d His hand was now under my skirt where he discovered my lack of underwear.</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d I hit speed dial for Damian. When he answered, I handed the phone to Ray.</p><p>\u201cCancel my order. Glory\u2019s talked me out of it.\u201d Ray grinned as he eased a finger inside me. \u201cYeah, she can be pretty persuasive.\u201d He ended the call, tossed the phone aside and then covered my mouth with his.</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother to think about what we were doing or whether this was right or wrong or consequences. With Ray I was all about wonderful feelings and the excitement of surprises. This time it was a slow sensual hum of my senses as Ray sang his way from one end of my body to the other.</p><p>I\u2019d lost my own song. I hadn\u2019t had time to really think about that. I\u2019d once been able to sing as wonderfully as Aggie did. When she sang everyone stopped to listen and felt compelled to follow her. Like that old fairy tale where the mice trailed along behind the Pied Piper. As I listened to Ray\u2019s hum of satisfaction while he played my body like a master, I tried to sing along in my mind. It was hopeless. I had no music in me. The miracle was that I still had any Siren magic at all. It made me wonder how that was possible. I needed to talk to Aggie. Sooner rather than later.</p><p>I almost quit thinking as Ray plucked the strings of my heart and love vibrated through me. It occurred to me that he wasn\u2019t pressuring me to drink my blood. What did that mean? Ian said my blood was addictive, that it gave men a boost. Was Ray immune because he had enough of mine in him already?</p><p>I abandoned the puzzle as he moved over me with a grin. This man was so special. And he\u2019d even forgiven me for consorting with his enemy. But Lucky was still out there to be dealt with. My last thought before I lost my mind completely was that I hoped I never saw her again.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Of course Lucky was waiting for me when I got home. Too much to hope that she wouldn\u2019t be. She posted her bodyguards outside my door before turning to me with a knowing smirk.</p><p>\u201cGeez. Look at you. Still in last night\u2019s clothes and reeking of sex. Blade? Or Israel Caine?\u201d She plopped into a chair. \u201cCaine, of course. You had to go running over there to warn him that the big bad bitch is back, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was hot to stake you, but I talked him down. Only because I didn\u2019t want him to have a hassle with the vampire council here. They might not like him staking another vamp, even one who really deserves to die.\u201d I headed into my bedroom and slammed my door. I was determined to change clothes, sick of feeling inferior in the fashion department around Lucky. I stripped off, pulling out fresh underwear and slipping into it in record time. Next I found my most expensive designer sweater, secondhand of course, and a flattering pair of black pants. When I felt ready I opened the door and walked back into the living room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was quite a speech. Bottom line, Caine\u2019s not coming after me?\u201d Lucky gave me a good, long look. \u201cDecent, though skinny jeans would have been better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate skinny jeans.\u201d Because I couldn\u2019t get them up past my thighs without a struggle. \u201cBesides, my fashion choices are not on the agenda. Let\u2019s get this over with. Did you go see Ian?\u201d I headed to the kitchen for a bottle of synthetic.</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s testing my blood. Hot guy. He\u2019ll know tomorrow night if we\u2019re a match. I don\u2019t see why we wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d She sighed and nodded toward my bottle. \u201cYou going to offer me one of those?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot hardly.\u201d I showed her the label.</p><p>She wrinkled her nose. \u201cGah. I only drink premium brands anyway. Now tell me more about this Siren thing. Any powers go along with the blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know. Wouldn\u2019t tell you if I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to Ray really got a bug up your butt, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Lucky sniffed.</p><p>I just sipped my drink and decided to test one of my so-called powers. I reached out with my mind. Of course Lucky\u2019s thoughts were blocked. I tried to punch through that block and bam! I made it. I saw her startled look as I read that she was bored in Austin and needed to get back to New York. Ian had made a pass and she\u2019d played it coy. Now she was aggravated and confused. Siren magic or Lucky as usual?</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell did you just do?\u201d She aimed a shaky finger at me.</p><p>\u201cPushed through your mental block. How\u2019d you like it?\u201d I grinned and set my bottle on the coffee table. \u201cTa da! Siren power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. What was I thinking?\u201d She grabbed her tablet out of her purse and turned it on.</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, when Ian made a pass at you, you didn\u2019t know if it was the Siren thing or if he was really attracted to you. It pissed you off.\u201d I crossed my legs like this was no big deal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be damned.\u201d Lucky tapped in notes.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s from my Siren blood. Or it could be a holdover from when I had a demon inside me. My life\u2019s been a nonstop party since you\u2019ve been gone, Lucky.\u201d</p> <p>She crossed herself. \u201cA demon? I hope you got rid of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get down to business, Lucky.\u201d I stood and loomed over her, clearly startling her. \u201cYes, you probably have Siren blood and I don\u2019t give a damn if you do. Because I swore to Ray that I would not, under any circumstances, help you. And I will definitely not take money from you. Capite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you just say to me?\u201d Lucky jumped to her feet.</p><p>\u201cThe deal is off.\u201d I pulled her check out of my purse and ripped it in half. \u201cForget it. I won\u2019t mentor you. Not for any amount of money. Ray\u2019s friendship means too much to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a contract.\u201d Her face turned red and she fisted her hands. Was she actually going to get violent about this? I zipped across the room in a vamp move as I read her thoughts. No, she wasn\u2019t, but her \u201cboys\u201d were about to.</p><p>\u201cYou know what you can do with your contract and it won\u2019t do you any good to call in the troops. I have a weapon now that will make them useless.\u201d I smiled and leaned against the wall next to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? I\u2019d like to see that.\u201d Lucky stalked over to jerk open the door. \u201cGet in here. We\u2019ve got a deadbeat. Show her how we deal with those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it, boss.\u201d Bodyguard number one, who could have been a poster boy for steroid use and a bench press championship, ambled toward me. I had him frozen in place before he\u2019d taken two steps.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Lucky glanced at her second guy. \u201cGet her.\u201d</p><p>The second bodyguard nudged his partner then, obviously puzzled by his lack of response, shrugged one massive shoulder and started toward me. I let him get pretty close, playing with him, before I turned him to stone.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you like that demo, Lucky? Impressive, isn\u2019t it?\u201d I dusted off my hands, like I\u2019d just finished a messy piece of work. I strolled around the men to admire what I\u2019d done. \u201cWhen I thaw them, I want you to take them and get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold it. That statue trick. Is that because of the Siren blood? You think I could do it?\u201d Lucky grabbed her purse, going for that damned tablet again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, though it could have come from the demon.\u201d I grinned when Lucky dropped her purse and crossed herself again. \u201cI\u2019ve even had personal business with Lucifer. Seems he took a shine to me.\u201d I glanced at my wooden floor. \u201cMaybe the Siren allure works on the Devil too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlasphemy! I won\u2019t listen to this. But turning people into statues. I just bet a Siren can do it. I want to know how.\u201d Lucky picked up her purse again.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to work with another Siren because I\u2019m not telling you a damned thing.\u201d I pointed at her men. \u201cI\u2019m counting to three then thawing these fireplugs. Take them and get out. Or do you want to become part of my decorating scheme too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Lucky narrowed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t I? Imagine being stuck where you stand, not able to even blink. I\u2019ve been paralyzed like that more than once and it\u2019s hell. Once I was on a boat and almost fell overboard.\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cYeah. Imagine going under water and you can\u2019t do anything to save yourself.\u201d I shivered, remembering. \u201cHow would you like a long walk off a short pier, Lucky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going. But this isn\u2019t over. No one welches on a deal with Lucky Carver and gets away with it.\u201d She threw her purse strap over her shoulder and opened the door. \u201cThaw \u2019em. I\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Just remember that I\u2019m stronger than you are, Lucky. As your sire my blood is way more potent. You might think you can do what I can do, but I doubt it.\u201d I thawed her men and she ordered them out to the hall when they cursed and started toward me like they were planning to take me apart.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just see about that, won\u2019t we?\u201d Lucky huffed and puffed then strutted out the door and down the stairs.</p><p>I slammed the door and leaned against it. Trying to outbitch a bitch had plain worn me out. When there was a knock almost immediately, I admit I jumped.</p><p>\u201cGlory, it\u2019s Laurie. I waited until your company left. Are you okay in there?\u201d</p><p>I threw open the door. \u201cYes, fine. But am I glad to see you.\u201d I sagged against the door frame. \u201cA few minutes ago I might have asked you to shift into your tiger. God, I hate that woman who just left. That was the infamous Lucky Carver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay\u2019s enemy. Glad I got a look at her.\u201d Laurie looked thoughtful. \u201cHe told me you sired her. But the way she stomped out of here, I\u2019d say there\u2019s no love lost between you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay probably also shared how she turned him vampire against his will, then dumped him on me.\u201d I paced the room, finally collapsing on the couch. \u201cSit. Can I get you anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d ask if you have any meat left but I know you don\u2019t.\u201d Laurie grinned. \u201cI cleaned you out when I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were welcome to it.\u201d I sighed. \u201cThis Lucky thing. It\u2019s a war now. She wanted me to act like her sire and teach her about Sirens. But I promised Ray I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d I put my feet on the coffee table, something I usually forbid anyone to do. At this point I could care less about my furniture. \u201cAnyway, Lucky and I had a contract and I just broke it. To Lucky a contract is sacred so now she\u2019s out for my blood.\u201d I grimaced. \u201cWell, you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do. Her type can\u2019t stand to lose anything. She has to think she put something over on you.\u201d Laurie got up and wandered into the kitchen. She came out with a pint of Chunky Monkey ice cream and a spoon. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. I can\u2019t eat it. Rafe\u2019s not coming over now, so it\u2019s up for grabs.\u201d I rubbed my forehead. \u201cWhen you left Ray was he still okay? Not rethinking that order for alcohol was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he was working on a new song, though this one wasn\u2019t upbeat like what he had been playing. You learn quickly in that job to gauge Ray\u2019s mood by the tunes that come out of there. This stuff you two are going through has brought him down. I won\u2019t pretend he\u2019s not struggling. The guards are all talking about it.\u201d Laurie swallowed a spoonful of ice cream. \u201cTo change the subject\u2014since you\u2019re keeping away from Rafe, I guess that means he\u2019s fair game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But will it do any good? If he\u2019s under a Siren\u2019s spell, can he actually break free of it?\u201d I was up again, collecting my empty bottle and going back for a new one. I glanced at Laurie. So she was going to make a run at Rafe. Why not? Like I\u2019d noticed before, they\u2019d be good together. And I had no right to be jealous. No right. \u201cI need to talk to Aggie. Get some details. Of course the men she traps with her song never have an opportunity to pull free, they\u2019re doomed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAggie would say each man dies with a smile on his face.\u201d Laurie sighed. \u201cSirens are a different breed, Glory. You can ask Aggie for help, but I\u2019m not sure what she\u2019ll offer. They don\u2019t have much heart.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNot like you. I got to know you well enough to see that Achelous had a good reason to toss you out of their club. You\u2019re way too humane for that gang.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks.\u201d I smiled back. It was a relief to hear from someone objective.</p><p>\u201cAs for Rafe.\u201d She took another bite of ice cream. \u201cTime will tell, I guess.\u201d</p><p>And time for a subject change. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you and Circe, Laurie? That was quite a trick you pulled, bringing her to the meeting the other night. How\u2019d you manage it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my ways.\u201d The were-tiger played with her spoon. \u201cCirce and I have a connection. I knew she had some old issues with Achelous so when you told me what was going down, I called her, told her the deal. She was eager to get into it with us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cObviously I was just a pawn in her little game with him.\u201d I twisted off the top of my fresh bottle. It was some of my expensive stash that I hadn\u2019t wanted to bring out in front of Lucky. \u201cIt\u2019s great that she cared about his Sirens, but he\u2019s still treating them like his personal slaves. I don\u2019t know how Aggie stands it century after century.\u201d I took a swallow and savored the smooth slide of the rich liquid down my throat. \u201cI realize now how lucky I was to escape, even if I did lose my song and love of the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are big losses. But when he wiped your memory, Achelous actually did you a huge favor. Think how horrible you would have felt all these years, wanting what you couldn\u2019t have.\u201d Laurie and I were quiet for a few moments, each thinking deep thoughts.</p><p>Finally, I spoke my thoughts out loud. \u201cBut why did he leave me with any powers at all? I obviously can still draw men to me, can freeze people in their tracks and burst through mind blocks. Maybe I can do even more. I\u2019ll have to talk to Aggie about that. The bottom line is that I have plenty of good stuff inside me that Achelous didn\u2019t take.\u201d</p> <p>Laurie moved over to sit beside me. She put her hand on my shoulder and stared into my eyes. \u201cSeriously? I think Achelous did all he could do to you, Glory. He couldn\u2019t reach any deeper. And that, my friend, is news that Aggie and the sisterhood really should hear. You might hold the key to their freedom.\u201d</p><p>We smiled at each other. Yes, Achelous was a bastard and I\u2019d like nothing more than to pay him back for what he\u2019d done to me. Free the Sirens? Suddenly I had a plan.</p><p>It was a beautiful night, not a cloud in the sky, but I still shivered. Maybe because I was on the shore next to a lake again. Too many memories haunted me as I stared out at the calm water. That boat ride when Ray and I had met Aggie in the first place. Achelous\u2019s temper tantrum on a terrace not far from here. I could go on. But tonight I\u2019d called Aggie and arranged a meeting. Without telling Ray about it. He wouldn\u2019t like it when he heard, but this was my business. I\u2019d give him a report later if there was anything he needed to know.</p><p>A quiet splash signaled that my date had arrived. Aggie emerged from the lake, for once bothering with a bathing suit. I knew she didn\u2019t usually hide her assets when she was out trolling for victims. How, I didn\u2019t know. Instinct I guess. Had she killed someone tonight?</p><p>\u201cQuit staring at me like I\u2019m some evil creature from a horror flick.\u201d Aggie wrung out her wet hair, blinked and she was dry and dressed in a pair of skinny jeans and a snug red T-shirt. Her hair was dry too and it was beautiful, with golden waves down her back.</p> <p>\u201cNeat trick. Why didn\u2019t you use it the other night when we were with Achelous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going for his sympathy. Not that I got any.\u201d She frowned. \u201cAnd I hoped the wet look would take his mind off my misdeeds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnooping for my records in the archives?\u201d I sat down on the blanket I\u2019d brought along. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know the kill numbers you trotted out blew my mind.\u201d I stared down at my hands. \u201cGod, so many.\u201d I looked at her again. \u201cHow can you deny you\u2019re evil, Aggie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou used to kill too. Though your numbers were puny.\u201d Aggie sat across from me. She materialized a leather bag and pulled out a compact and lipstick. \u201cGuess we\u2019re both evil. Deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to.\u201d Not that I was making any progress. Killing for sport? I just couldn\u2019t imagine being part of that. I swallowed a nausea that had been with me ever since I\u2019d found out I\u2019d been like her once, able to kill and then just... powder my nose before looking for my next victim. God. I tried not to let her see how much all this was getting to me and lifted my chin. \u201cAchelous is a piece of work. You really have to debase yourself like that every time you meet with him?\u201d</p><p>Aggie closed the compact with a snap. \u201cI pander to his ego. It\u2019s a game the Sirens play, to keep the peace. I don\u2019t appreciate your attitude.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry if I\u2019m upsetting you.\u201d Of course it had humiliated her that we\u2019d seen her cowed by that god. The Aggie who strutted around Austin in her designer duds took no prisoners.</p><p>\u201cLike you could.\u201d She tossed her hair, determined to play the tough girl.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, humor me. I have questions about myself. And maybe an answer for you. We could exchange information\u2014if you care to share.\u201d I put my hand on her arm. This was important, and I knew she could tell me to just stuff it and take off at any moment.</p><p>\u201cI came here, didn\u2019t I? I\u2019ve actually felt kind of sorry for you, Gloriana. The sisters and I talked about you. We realize Achy did you dirty. All of us have had bad seasons when our numbers were down. The idea that he could toss any one of us out and wipe our memories? Hon, it\u2019s sickening.\u201d Aggie shuddered then carefully put away her lipstick and compact. \u201cSo I\u2019ll cut you some slack. What do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, about my blood. I\u2019ve made a vampire, then she turned Ray, Israel Caine. They have Siren blood now. Will that give them any Siren powers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t they wish. But we don\u2019t get our power from the blood, it comes through the mind and the body.\u201d Aggie ran her hands down her own perfect shape. \u201cWhich is one reason I was so freaked when Circe cursed me that time and took my beauty away. Bitch. But I have to admit she came through for us the other night. Women should stick together. Tell Ray and that other vamp they get nada, zip, from their Siren blood.\u201d Aggie grinned. \u201cExcept maybe a little status. It\u2019s a rare thing, don\u2019t you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I hit her hand when she offered it for a high five. Why not? She was right. But it made me wonder about Ian\u2019s claims. Clarity. If nothing came from blood, then how could he make a drug from it? I\u2019d have to think about that later. Right now I had Aggie here and more questions.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to experiment to see what powers you\u2019ve got now. This vampire change is bound to have done a number on your abilities.\u201d Aggie frowned at me.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve still got my body and my mind, even if my memory\u2019s shot. I\u2019ve figured out that I can turn people to statues, just like you can. Alesa the demon showed me that one. And blast through mind blocks, though anyone more powerful than I am seems to be able to stand up to me on that score.\u201d I made an attempt to read Aggie\u2019s mind and hit a wall.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better believe I can resist your little foray into Aggieland, sweetie. But you can resist me too, when I come at you. Firm your wall. Not even I can read past your block if you\u2019re really determined to keep me out. Try it.\u201d She focused on my face.</p><p>I threw up the Great Wall of China then thought about Ray and how we\u2019d made love. I saw Aggie frown as she concentrated and actually felt her shoving at the barrier.</p><p>\u201cNice job, Glo. I think you\u2019ve got it.\u201d She turned to look at the lake. \u201cStill scared of the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrified. Achelous must have planted that idea in my head.\u201d I looked out at the reflection of a moon on the shimmering surface but didn\u2019t see beauty, only danger hidden beneath the water. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose we can do anything about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubt it. He\u2019s a real son of a bitch.\u201d Aggie sighed. \u201cAnd he took your song. That\u2019s a killer. But surely...\u201d She stared at me for a moment. \u201cTry to sing. Right now. I want to hear what you\u2019ve got.\u201d Aggie leaned back on her elbows.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, you don\u2019t. I can\u2019t carry a tune. It\u2019s pathetic.\u201d I shook my head but she just kept her eyes on me, daring me. \u201cOkay, you asked for it.\u201d I raised my chin and belted out one of Ray\u2019s love songs. I knew every word and had sung along to his CDs in the privacy of my car and in the shower. But I knew my efforts were painful to listen to. I didn\u2019t even make it to the chorus before Aggie stopped me.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d Aggie had covered her ears. \u201cYou make it hard to believe you were ever a Siren. Girl, this is the worst. Achy should go to hell for what he did to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s odd, but I don\u2019t miss singing. Ray\u2019s about to go into a deep depression over it. As an artist, he says it\u2019s \u2018tragic.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay\u2019s right. It is.\u201d Aggie wiped at a tear and cursed fluently in several languages. \u201cWait till I tell the sisters. This is unforgivable. We each have our own special song and it defines us. It\u2019s our signature, I guess you could say. Damn it. Achelous took your identity, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>I felt tears pop into my own eyes but blinked them back. Wait a minute. I didn\u2019t need a song to know who I was, did I? I\u2019d managed to create a life, make friends, develop a personality and all without singing a single note.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Aggie. I\u2019ve coped, but it wasn\u2019t always easy. Luckily, I did have help along the way. Not sisters, of course. Like you do.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe it when Aggie actually patted my hand.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my family, Glo. It\u2019s a shame Achy cast you out without one.\u201d She sniffed, then pulled out her compact again.</p><p>\u201cHow does the sisterhood work? Aren\u2019t you scattered all over the world?\u201d I leaned back on the blanket.</p><p>\u201cWe communicate telepathically.\u201d She tapped her head. \u201cThough we can get together in a blink of an eye. Doubt you can teleport. It takes a pretty powerful psychic connection to each other to get us into a group. And an emergency. We\u2019re too vulnerable when we\u2019re, um, clustered.\u201d Aggie appraised me. \u201cI feel funny sharing Siren secrets with you, Gloriana. You\u2019re one of us, but you\u2019re not. Swear to me right now that this stuff stays with us. Or I\u2019ll hunt you down, girl. And you know I can make your life a living hell.\u201d</p><p>I held out my hand. \u201cAggie, I never had a sister that I remember. And a group of murdering Sirens isn\u2019t exactly what I had in mind. But I won\u2019t betray you. I\u2019m here to help you. Other than the powers I\u2019ve already showed people, what we say here, stays here.\u201d We shook hands and I let Aggie read my mind to reassure her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay then. What else do you want to know?\u201d She seemed to finally relax.</p><p>\u201cThis one is really serious. Do you think I\u2019m still drawing men to me? Achelous claimed I was. Putting them under my Siren\u2019s spell.\u201d I looked out over the water until I got the urge to cry under control. \u201cI think that Jerry, Rafe, and even Ray only love me because I\u2019ve enchanted them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAchelous is a freaking liar, Glo.\u201d Aggie sat up straight and grabbed my hand. \u201cListen to me and listen good. A Siren draws men to her with her song. Since you lost yours when Achy threw you away, you have never, since that day, been able to enchant anyone. Got it?\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cAre you sure? I mean how does that explain...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know my business, Gloriana. I\u2019ve been doing it for over a thousand years. I can walk the streets anywhere and men might look twice because, honey, I am hot. But they are not enchanted by any stretch. Not until I sing my song. Got it?\u201d She squeezed my hand then let it go.</p><p>\u201cI, I don\u2019t know. I have evidence. Jerry\u2019s stayed with me for centuries. And Rafe. He won\u2019t give up on me, even though I begged him to take off and find someone else.\u201d</p><p>Aggie looked me up and down. \u201cMen are funny creatures. Sometimes I even hesitate to kill them.\u201d She waved a hand. \u201cOh, I get over it and do my duty, but honestly, Glo, you must have something special that they love.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cHate that word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t ever love anyone?\u201d I focused on her, not trying to read her mind, but her emotions. I realized there was a deep core of sadness inside that shell of bravado and kick-ass Aglaophonos.</p> <p>\u201cNo point. The guy\u2019s gonna bite it. Can\u2019t get attached. Tried it a time or two and it didn\u2019t end well. You remember when you met me?\u201d Aggie gave me a lopsided grin. \u201cCirce had cursed me, made me look like a monster. And it was over a man, Glo. Lesson learned. I won\u2019t go through that again. Fun and games only for me from now on. Unless I\u2019m working of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I get it. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I really was, even though for myself I was struggling not to laugh and dance along the shore I was so relieved. I hadn\u2019t whammied my guys! How about that?</p><p>Aggie picked up a rock and tossed it into the water, staring at the ripples it made. \u201cAre we done now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d I waited until I had her complete attention. \u201cYou and the sisters have served Achelous all these years because you\u2019re afraid of him. Right?\u201d</p><p>Aggie plucked at a loose string in the blanket. \u201cI guess you could say that. We needed a leader and he\u2019s it. He offers us protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what, Aggie? You look pretty self-sufficient to me.\u201d I saw I\u2019d hit a nerve.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t remember how it is on Olympus, Gloriana. Sirens... We aren\u2019t part of your world. We\u2019re...\u201d Aggie shook her head. \u201cNever mind. You can\u2019t come back to us. He did make you mortal somehow and now you\u2019re vampire. There are some things I can\u2019t share with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlympus stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Aggie stared out at the lake, like she was about to leave me where I sat.</p><p>\u201cJust listen for a minute. Achelous\u2019s protection seems to come at too high a price. I\u2019m a prime example of how he treats women who don\u2019t fall in line with his policies.\u201d I waited until she looked at me again. \u201cYou want to chance losing your song and your love of the sea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, hell no.\u201d Aggie\u2019s face told the story. She was appalled.</p><p>\u201cThen you need to get away from him. Instead of being in his harem, where you have to do God knows what when he calls for you, why not defect? I bet Circe wouldn\u2019t mind being in charge of the Sirens. If you really feel like you need a god or goddess to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a radical thought. Circe shares the man-hater thing so our mission statements align. But she has her own issues\u2014remember me as a sea monster? Still, another woman... Yeah, I like it.\u201d Aggie jumped to her feet. \u201cIf Achelous got wind of a plot like this though? I can\u2019t imagine...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you band together, all of you, what can he do? Destroy the sisterhood? Surely he wouldn\u2019t do that. How would that play on Olympus?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot too well. We have something of a reputation up there. And ties to some pretty important people. The sisters have always spread our favors around where it counts if you know what I mean.\u201d Aggie winked at me. \u201cIt\u2019s just good politics. But if Achy\u2019s listening in right now...\u201d Aggie bowed her head, obviously doing some listening of her own. \u201cNo, he\u2019s still up there with Circe in front of Zeus. I heard they\u2019ve got a battle royal going. But he\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d She grinned at me. \u201cClever girl. Now I\u2019ve got a going-away present for you. One more power for you to try from your Siren arsenal. Let\u2019s see if your vampire body can manage this one. It\u2019s what they call mind over matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? What is it?\u201d I was up and ready for anything.</p><p>\u201cYou ever dematerialize?\u201d Aggie said just before she disappeared.</p><p>\u201cNo. You mean I could?\u201d I jumped when Aggie suddenly appeared behind me.</p><p>\u201cPossibly. Achy brainwashed you. I\u2019m pretty sure, with a good shrink, you could actually get back some memories. Like your love of the sea and your song.\u201d Aggie\u2019s hand landed on my back. \u201cGo see Ian. He\u2019s a genius at that kind of thing. We didn\u2019t just have pillow talk. He\u2019s a brilliant psychiatrist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know. But I think Ian has been lying to me about something big.\u201d Did I want my song back? No way in hell. I glanced at the water a few feet away and felt a sudden longing. It would be wonderful to be able to swim again, to cut through the water and feel the sea claim me as one of her own. \u201cNow about this dematerializing thing. Tell me how. And I wouldn\u2019t mind being able to create outfits and dry hair either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, my sister, I\u2019m afraid might be beyond you.\u201d But Aggie did share secrets and they were remarkably simple. Then she took off, obviously eager to discuss her thoughts on rebellion with her sisters. I sat back on the blanket and stared at the lake. So the men in my life were there because they chose to be. I knew what I needed to do next. I gathered up the blanket and skipped to my car. I\u2019d love to sing my joy but knew better. And that was okay.</p><p>I could hear the music as soon as I drove up to Ray\u2019s front door. Laurie was on duty and took my keys from me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put it in the garage if you\u2019re staying the day.\u201d She grinned at me.</p><p>\u201cNo, leave it out front. I\u2019m not sure how this is going to go.\u201d I leaned against the trunk. \u201cI met with Aggie. Ray\u2019s going to be disappointed by what I found out. He\u2019s not getting anything from his Siren blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that matters. He\u2019s got a connection to you anyway, Glory.\u201d Laurie tossed my keys back to me. \u201cHe\u2019s been singing about you all evening. Or at least that\u2019s what it sounds like to me.\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head and listened. Ray\u2019s song was about a woman who couldn\u2019t make music. It was a ballad with a refrain that made you want to cry into your Bloody Mary. I hoped I could cheer him up and out of that mood.</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t do. Too much of that angst and he\u2019ll be ordering alcohol again.\u201d I tucked my keys into my purse. \u201cAny sign of trouble tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more than usual. A paparazzo climbed up from the lake and got a picture of Ray strutting around the living room in his black silk boxers. I had fun smashing that guy\u2019s camera and tossing him in the water. Then a couple of thirtysomething housewives tried to climb the fence for an autograph. Ray came out and obliged before we ran them off.\u201d Laurie\u2019s smile was tigerish.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re enjoying this job.\u201d I headed for the front door.</p><p>\u201cI am. And it doesn\u2019t hurt my feelings that Ray does parade around in a little bit of nothing most of the time.\u201d She fanned her face. \u201cThe man has quite a body. But I don\u2019t need to tell you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d I was grinning as I walked in the house and dropped my purse on the entry table. Ray kept playing though I knew he saw me enter the living room. The drapes were closed for a change. Probably because of that incident with the photographer.</p><p>\u201cNice tune.\u201d I settled on the couch. \u201cBut I\u2019m not feeling it.\u201d</p><p>He stopped playing. \u201cYou have news for me?\u201d He jumped up and strode to the couch. He\u2019d put on jeans, probably when he\u2019d made the housewives\u2019 night. Now he sat beside me and pulled me in for a quick kiss.</p><p>\u201cMaybe, but you\u2019ll have to do better than that to worm it out of me.\u201d I brushed my thumb across his lips.</p><p>\u201cI can handle that.\u201d He lowered his head and took my mouth in a leisurely way that curled my toes. Before I knew it I was stretched out on that long leather sofa and he was on top of me.</p><p>\u201cMmm. Ray, I think I\u2019m ready to talk.\u201d I ran my hands over his bare back, savoring the ripple of muscle there. He\u2019d worked out before he\u2019d been turned and it showed.</p><p>\u201cForget it. Talk can wait.\u201d He pushed up my sweater and smiled when he saw my leopard print bra. \u201cI like this. You came ready to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I sighed when he licked the edges of the demicups then nosed them down to circle my aching nipples. \u201cYou are very good at this. I\u2019m happy to tell you that it\u2019s not the Siren blood that\u2019s doing it\u2019s magic. You can take total credit in the seduction department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Ray didn\u2019t even bother to look up, too intent on unfastening my jeans and easing them down. I had worn a scrap of black lace that made him growl. \u201cBeen talking to Aggie without me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, woman to woman. Oh, Ray.\u201d He\u2019d kissed his way down to delve into my navel, then slipped my panties down along with my jeans. They got hung up on my thighs. Ray didn\u2019t push them farther, just used them to hold me while he kissed and licked me with a master\u2019s expertise. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo my Siren blood doesn\u2019t count for anything?\u201d He rolled me from side to side until he could get those jeans down enough to part my legs even farther. \u201cThere\u2019s what I\u2019m after.\u201d He bent his head and used his hands to open me to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt, um, counts to, oh, make you, ee, unique.\u201d I gasped and trembled on the verge of climax. \u201cThere are so few of\u2014oh my God!\u2014you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust me and Lucky.\u201d Ray sat up and tore off his clothes. My jeans and sweater were the next to go. \u201cAnd you, of course. What does your blood do, Gloriana?\u201d He pulled me to my feet and to the middle of the enormous room. What did he have in mind? The piano bench? The hot tub bubbling on the terrace? That one made me shudder. Or was he going to drag me down to the black and white rug and finish this there? For a moment we just faced each other, both of us naked. He was perfect. Me? Not even close.</p> <p>\u201cNothing. I can\u2019t draw men to me, Ray. Only my song can and I don\u2019t have it. Isn\u2019t that great news?\u201d I waited, not sure for what, and rested my hands on his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSo what I\u2019m feeling for you is real?\u201d He ran a fingertip from my shoulder to my breast to my hip.</p><p>I shivered and ran my fingertip down the same path on his body. \u201cI\u2019m not sure exactly what you feel for me, Ray, but it\u2019s not some kind of Siren magic. It\u2019s just me, Gloriana, here. Chubby thighs and all.\u201d I flushed and realized that was a damned stupid thing to say. Now, of course, he\u2019d look at them, judge them and compare them to the model-slim thighs he\u2019d seen and screwed in Hollywood and all over the world.</p><p>He dropped to his knees in front of me. \u201cI love your thighs. They\u2019re strong and grip me hard when I\u2019m between them.\u201d He ran a row of kisses along each one. \u201cAnd I love you. Damned if I don\u2019t.\u201d He pulled me down to the rug and on top of him. \u201cMake love with me, Glory girl. I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay.\u201d My voice shook as I dropped down in front of him and kissed him with my heart in it. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know that this may be the last time we\u2019re together like this.\u201d He lay back and pulled me on top of him. \u201cI\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last...\u201d I stretched until my toes tangled with his, my body savoring the feel of his against every inch. His hard shaft nudged me and I opened my legs. But he didn\u2019t try to take me yet.</p><p>\u201cBlade, Glory. I know you still want to see him. To clear things up with him.\u201d Ray pushed his fingers into my hair. \u201cHe left here thinking you trapped him, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I kept my eyes on Ray\u2019s, not about to deny that. \u201cHis pride was terribly hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna hurt too, when you\u2019re gone.\u201d He pulled my head down to kiss me deeply then rolled us until he was on top, looking down at me.</p><p>\u201cWhere am I going, Ray?\u201d I wrapped my legs around his hips and moaned as he pushed inside me. I wanted him, couldn\u2019t wait for that glorious movement that would take us out of ourselves and into that special place where nothing mattered but pleasure. Why did he have to bring up such serious matters now?</p> <p>\u201cScotland, of course. It\u2019s necessary.\u201d Ray began to move, thrusting deep so that I felt every inch of him. \u201cBut if he\u2019s idiot enough to refuse to take you back?\u201d His pace quickened and he lifted my hips so I could feel just how strong and right we were together. \u201cBaby, you will come back to me. Got it?\u201d</p><p>I trembled, feeling the waves of pleasure crash on my shore as he leaned down to take my vein. I raked his back with my nails and smelled his blood, similar to mine but with a salty difference that was as erotic as it was irresistible. I wanted that pull of his mouth on my neck, needed that pressure of his cock deep inside me and loved the words he whispered in my mind as the world disappeared and we held each other. Ray. He was sending me to Scotland.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>I had to tell Rafe the good news too. That he wasn\u2019t one of my victims. But I couldn\u2019t do it while I was reeking of sex with Ray. I\u2019d stayed and played and spent the day sacked out in Ray\u2019s arms. Then he\u2019d arranged a chartered jet to Scotland for me. Got to love a man who\u2019d do something like that when he knew I was going to see his rival. I admit I was misty-eyed as I kissed Ray good-bye, fully intending for it to be the last time before my trip.</p><p>I stopped at the apartment first and washed from head to toe to get every trace of Ray off of me. Rafe had a shifter\u2019s nose and I wasn\u2019t going to make this news any more challenging for him. When I walked into N-V, I didn\u2019t want to throw out any lures but a woman has her pride. My usual black pants were snug enough to be interesting and my red and black tunic top roomy enough to hide the tummy bulge that was finally almost gone. The red cheeks? At least the lighting at N-V was dim. I was really going to have to talk to Ian about that. And his lies about my blood.</p><p>I sidled up to the bartender and ordered some of the blood with alcohol. \u201cIs Rafe around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure is. Hang here and he\u2019ll be out in a minute. I called him about a customer giving me some grief.\u201d Skip, the bartender, nodded down the long and crowded bar. Oh, I should have known. Who was parked on a bar stool, her thugs behind her, but Lucky? She was knocking back the high-octane blood and arguing with my friend Diana Marchand, the owner of Mugs and Muffins. Interesting that one of the thugs was a new guy, not a thick-necked shifter but a tall, dark and handsome vampire whose power could be felt even from where I stood, yards away. Can\u2019t say I liked that development.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess. Trying to collect a debt?\u201d I gestured toward Lucky. Other customers were easing away, trying to give the pair some space.</p> <p>\u201cYou got it and the loud one wouldn\u2019t take it outside. Believe me, I tried.\u201d Skip grimaced and wiped down the bar. \u201cHere comes the boss now.\u201d</p><p>Rafe smiled at me then looked down the bar and did a double take. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me. When did Lucky Carver hit town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few days ago. Still the same Lucky we love to hate.\u201d I knew that when Lucky saw me, she\u2019d shift her attention. Diana would be grateful, but things might get ugly. \u201cCan I talk to you in your office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I want her out of here.\u201d Rafe looked like he meant business, obviously excited by the prospect of tossing Lucky out on her ass.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, Rafe. Her goons take their jobs seriously.\u201d I put a cautionary hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI can handle this. Lucky. I\u2019ll be damned.\u201d Rafe squeezed my hand. \u201cBe right back. Hang tight.\u201d</p><p>I followed him with some idea of offering backup. He stepped between Diana and Lucky and both women paused in their argument to scope him out appreciatively. He wore his usual uniform for work, one of those black T-shirts with the red N-V logo slashed across the front. Of course it fit like a well-worn glove. So did his jeans. Several other women at the bar were giving him the eye too. Diana used his arrival as a distraction and tried to slip away.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast, lady. There\u2019s the matter of the money you owe me.\u201d Lucky latched onto Diana\u2019s arm and signaled her \u201cboys.\u201d They moved in, blocking Diana\u2019s escape route. Lucky\u2019s new vampire put his hand on her back and she got a deer-in-headlights look. \u201cYou aren\u2019t leaving until I get something on account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you\u2014\u201d Diana obviously didn\u2019t have the money and glanced down like maybe a bag of cash with her name on it would magically appear at her feet.</p><p>\u201cHey, this isn\u2019t going to happen here.\u201d Rafe pried Diana\u2019s arm from Lucky\u2019s grip but kept a hand on Lucky. \u201cTake it outside, Lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who I am?\u201d Lucky smiled with lips expertly colored and lined with a bold coral. \u201cHow?\u201d She shook her head when the guards made threatening rumbles and stared pointedly at Rafe\u2019s hold on their boss.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Valdez. I was there when you first arrived in town.\u201d Rafe\u2019s frown made it clear it wasn\u2019t a fond memory as he glanced at nearby mortals.</p><p>\u201cMy, oh, my. You shucked off the fur coat.\u201d Lucky caught my eye. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>Rafe gently pulled both women off their bar stools and to their feet. \u201cDiana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I go to the ladies\u2019 first?\u201d She aimed a panicked look across the room.</p><p>Lucky firmed her lips. \u201cNot unless one of my boys goes with you.\u201d She aimed a painted nail at Diana, who was already inching toward the exit. \u201cShe\u2019d be out the back door if I let her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d But Diana wasn\u2019t a great liar.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we keep it here but we keep it down.\u201d Rafe signaled the bartender, who picked up a phone. Within moments, the band announced a new set. That got the bar emptied as eager patrons hit the dance floor. \u201cDiana, you owe Lucky money?\u201d</p><p>Diana drained her glass then avoided Lucky\u2019s glare as she talked to Rafe. \u201cYes, stupid of me, but I did take out a loan when business got bad last summer.\u201d Diana glared at Lucky. \u201cThis woman passed out cards before she left town last time, courting my business. When no bank would give me a loan, naturally I called her.\u201d Diana held on to her black clutch like it was a lifeline. \u201cThe terms are just horrid, Rafe, but what was I to do? I figured business would pick up and it did, but...\u201d Diana was from the South and her drawl was becoming more obvious along with her distress.</p><p>Lucky held up her hand to cut her off. \u201cDo I care why? No. Payment\u2019s three months overdue. So pay now or I take possession of your collateral.\u201d Lucky\u2019s smile was pure predator. No wonder they called them loan sharks. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind owning a little coffee shop next to Glory\u2019s store.\u201d She glanced down the bar and gestured at me. \u201cDon\u2019t hang back. Come join us, Glory. We could be neighbors. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>I stepped to Rafe\u2019s side. \u201cI think I\u2019d help Diana sell her soul first.\u201d</p><p>Diana\u2019s gasp and Rafe\u2019s incredulous look let me know I\u2019d just stepped in it. I guess my history with Lucifer and the demons was still too fresh to even joke about hell. Diana actually crossed herself. Lucky\u2019s new bodyguard cracked a smile and wasn\u2019t that interesting? The way he was studying me, though, was getting on my last nerve. Mr. Intensity might laugh at my jokes, but I didn\u2019t doubt he was ready to do whatever he had to for Lucky\u2019s protection. I ignored him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, kidding! I\u2019m just here to see Rafe. You really should go outside like he asked you.\u201d I smiled at Diana. \u201cSorry about your troubles. Why don\u2019t you call Damian? I\u2019m sure he\u2019d bail you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking him for money.\u201d Diana looked down at the floor again. I hated myself but read her mind anyway. She\u2019d always believed that only whores asked their lovers for money. She\u2019d tried to avoid that in her long, long life and she wasn\u2019t about to sink that low now. \u201cHe\u2019s such a great businessman and I... Well, I\u2019m just not good with money. I tried to save but there always seemed to be an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, like a shoe sale at Nordstrom\u2019s.\u201d Lucky eyed Rafe then got down to business. \u201cI\u2019ve done some digging, Diana. Don\u2019t give me any sob stories. If we wore the same size, I\u2019d be taking those Prada slingbacks right off your pretty feet as a down payment.\u201d Lucky nodded and we all looked down.</p> <p>Diana had on this season\u2019s suede peep toes and I knew they\u2019d cost her several hundred dollars even on sale. I sure couldn\u2019t afford them. Hmm.</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Diana\u2019s cheeks were pink.</p><p>\u201cSure I would but, like I said, wrong size.\u201d Lucky winked at me. \u201cSounds like I\u2019m getting that spot next to you, after all, Glory. I\u2019ll hire a decent manager, then, when I\u2019m in town, we can hang out here together.\u201d She actually gave Rafe a hip bump. \u201cValdez, I like your little club.\u201d</p><p>Rafe dug into his back pocket. \u201cDiana, how much do you need? For this first payment?\u201d</p><p>Diana whispered to him and my eyes popped. She glanced at me. \u201cThe interest is terrible but I have bad credit. I told you, I don\u2019t handle my finances very well.\u201d She mumbled something about a shopping addiction.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not judging. You know I used to have a gambling problem. Totally blew my credit rating. There are twelve-step programs...\u201d I caught Rafe\u2019s look. \u201cWell, I highly recommend them. I know I had to reach bottom before I got that though.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe that Rafe was writing out a check. Did he have that kind of cash to spare? I glanced around the club. It was doing well and had really caught on with the college crowd. Vampires too liked to have a place to hang out and I saw several at tables on the balcony with glasses of blood, probably with alcohol, in front of them.</p><p>\u201cThere, now get out, Lucky. Diana, you and I will talk later. This is a loan. With interest. Though not as high as what Lucky obviously charged you.\u201d Rafe began pulling Lucky toward the front door. The bodyguards stayed out of it when Lucky waved them off again.</p><p>\u201cRafe, wait!\u201d Diana threw her arms around him. \u201cThank you!\u201d She kissed his cheek. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did this for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for you, Diana.\u201d Rafe stared at me. \u201cI don\u2019t want Lucky planted next to Glory, or to have any reason to stay in town. Understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. I remember their history.\u201d Diana gave me a sympathetic smile. \u201cGlory, I promise I\u2019ll pay back every penny. Like Rafe said, with interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you stop a minute?\u201d Lucky jerked her arm out of Rafe\u2019s grip. \u201cQuit with the bum\u2019s rush. Maybe I want to hang out for a while. Drink and dance. Isn\u2019t my money good here?\u201d She fluttered her eyelashes at Rafe.</p> <p>\u201cNo way in hell.\u201d He looked grim. \u201cGlory, what do you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHit the road, Lucky.\u201d I turned toward the bar and picked up my drink, ignoring her squeal of outrage.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me, bitch. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m letting this slide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMs. Carver, you want we should handle this?\u201d One of her guards, the thick-necked shifter, put his shoulder close to mine.</p><p>I heard Rafe growl before I turned to send Lucky a mental message. It would cause all kinds of problems, but I could make those boys of hers into statues here and now then take care of the fallout later. If she wanted to save face, she\u2019d better move along. She got it.</p><p>\u201cNo, this is getting to be a bore. I have a date later anyway. Let\u2019s go.\u201d She twitched her hips and waited while the shifter rushed to open the door. Then she headed out into the night. Her vampire guard stopped and glanced back at me, catching my gaze. I read something dark and determined there that made me shiver before he disappeared into the night.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is she doing in town?\u201d Rafe took my arm and steered me toward his office.</p><p>\u201cIan contacted her. About her blood. She wanted to know what it meant.\u201d I waited until we were inside with the door closed. \u201cI talked to Aggie. Seems unlikely it means anything. It\u2019s not the Siren blood that\u2019s important.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, if you talked to Aggie, does that mean you found out whether I\u2019m under your spell?\u201d Rafe moved close and slid his arms around my waist.</p><p>\u201cSeems Sirens draw men to them with their song. I lost mine thanks to Achelous.\u201d I sighed and gently took his hands off of me. \u201cSo any feelings you have for me, Rafe, are purely your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever doubted it. But what about yours for me or any of the men orbiting planet Glory?\u201d He frowned and sat on the edge of his messy desk. A few papers fell to the floor but he ignored them. \u201cYou say you love me. You love Blade. Hell, I\u2019ve even heard you say you love the rock star. What does that mean to you, Glory? Seems to me you throw the word around a little too easily. Hell, you even love your new boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou making fun of me? You have to know this whole Siren thing has put me through the wringer.\u201d Was I looking for sympathy? I could see by Rafe\u2019s expression that I wasn\u2019t getting any here. \u201cAnd, for the record, I don\u2019t love my new boots. I just bought them because they were on sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean. Don\u2019t try to deflect. This Siren thing is just the latest wrinkle in the Glory-go-round.\u201d Rafe kicked a paper across the room. \u201cUnder a spell or not, I don\u2019t like hanging around waiting to see how your love life falls out.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m finally ready to jump off the ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe.\u201d I wished there was something I could say to get our old friendship back where it belonged. But Rafe had his pride and I\u2019d hurt it. Damn. \u201cI hope that loan to Diana wasn\u2019t just for my sake. To keep Lucky from moving in next to me.\u201d I wanted to touch him, say something to ease the tension he was clearly feeling. \u201cI can handle Lucky and her goons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I should just let you try?\u201d Rafe moved closer. \u201cSorry, but I can\u2019t stand back and wait to see if you really can handle her. The Glory I know and love isn\u2019t exactly known for kicking butt.\u201d He smiled wryly. \u201cSo much for jumping off the ride. Obviously I\u2019m still yours whether you want me or not.\u201d</p><p>I looked up into eyes that knew me too well, cared for me more than I deserved. I didn\u2019t want to lead him on.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate everything you do, have done for me, Rafe. But you have to stop it. If I have problems, they\u2019re my problems and I have to deal with them. If I fail, then the fallout is on me, no one else.\u201d I laid my hand on his arm. His skin was hot, shifter hot. God, but I felt weak where he was concerned, wanting to lean on him and let him take care of me. Even now, it was all I could do not to rest my head against his broad chest.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019m finally getting the message, Glory. You keep pushing me away, telling me to move on.\u201d He stared at the ceiling, his jaw tight, then looked at me again. \u201cI get pissed and feel like saying to hell with you. No woman is worth what you put me through. But then I see you and all those good intentions evaporate. Damn it, I keep thinking I\u2019m right for you, that we make a great team. And someday you\u2019ll realize that and decide my time will come again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRafe, I can\u2019t\u2014I won\u2019t\u2014\u201d I shut up, not sure what to say to him. He was the best friend I\u2019d ever had. He\u2019d taken care of me, guarded me, risked his life for me. I did love him. And he was right. He wasn\u2019t the only man I loved. The Siren in me didn\u2019t seem to be built for monogamy.</p><p>\u201cYou are really blocking your thoughts. Maybe I don\u2019t want to know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d Rafe scrubbed his hands over his face.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t. I can\u2019t make any sense out of this anymore.\u201d I pulled his hands away to run my fingers over his jaw, so strong and masculine. \u201cI\u2019m a mess right now, Rafe. And one thing I need to do is straighten things out with Jerry. I\u2019m going to Scotland. To let him know that he\u2019s not under that Siren\u2019s spell. I don\u2019t know if that will make a difference to him, but it\u2019s something I have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade. He\u2019s always first with you, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Rafe pulled me to him and, being weak, I allowed it. \u201cI saw it up close for five years, Glory. I don\u2019t like it, but I know you love him, really love him, and it\u2019s not the new-boot kind of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Maybe I\u2019m the one under a spell. Could Circe have done that?\u201d I shook my head. \u201cNo, not blaming some goddess for my own feelings. He saved me, Rafe. When I was about to starve. And he\u2019s been my hero more than once. Just like you\u2019ve been.\u201d I kissed his cheek, the kind of kiss I would have given a brother.</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re friends now.\u201d Rafe hugged me and breathed against my hair. \u201cI\u2019ll take it and try to learn to live with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I sighed and pushed back. \u201cNow what about that check for Diana? Where did that money come from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt tore a hole in my savings. But I wasn\u2019t about to let Lucky have a reason to come back to Austin. She\u2019s nothing but trouble. Why is she here anyway? What about her father and his rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died and she took over the family business. Apparently she\u2019s doing a good job if that demo with Diana is any indication. She did get her payment.\u201d I stepped away from him. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll get your money back. Diana and I will have a little chat. As her friend maybe I can help her get her financial house in order, get into a twelve-step program if this is an addiction to shopping. Shoe sales?\u201d Of course I had new boots myself and then had come up short when I was scrambling for plane fare. Lucky for me I seemed to always have a man handy when I needed bailing out. Diana had too much pride for that. Why didn\u2019t I? It was something for me to think about. And I got a queasy feeling that it was a conversation with myself that was long overdue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe can both help her.\u201d Rafe smiled. \u201cShe has no idea what she\u2019s in for now that I hold her note. I\u2019m going to be looking at her books, making sure she pays off the rest of Lucky\u2019s loan ASAP. The sooner all ties with that bitch are broken, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I glanced at a clock on his wall. \u201cI need to go. I\u2019m heading over to see Ian now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Rafe opened the office door and the loud music after the quiet in the well-insulated office was a shock. But the steady beat made me want to dance. At least Achelous hadn\u2019t managed to kill my love for music.</p> <p>\u201cI want to get a few things off my chest. Yes, he helped me find out what I was. But he also lied to me about a few things.\u201d I walked toward the front door, Rafe by my side.</p><p>\u201cBe careful. How are you getting to Scotland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay\u2019s chartering a plane for me. Can you believe it?\u201d I said it like it was no big deal but Diana\u2019s words were haunting me. Only whores asked their lovers for money. I hadn\u2019t asked. But what was the difference, really? I\u2019d accepted quickly enough when it had been offered. Like I usually did. Money, favors, bodyguards. Rafe was staring at me, probing my thoughts and coming up empty. I kept a carefree smile on my face though it was becoming harder and harder to do.</p><p>Rafe shook his head. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t have us all under some kind of spell, Glory? I swear the things you get men to do for you boggles my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s nuts, isn\u2019t it? But Ray insisted. He hopes, I think, that Blade will slam the castle door in my face. And it might happen.\u201d I managed a shrug, like my entire future happiness didn\u2019t hang in the balance.</p> <p>Rafe leaned against the door frame. He cocked an eyebrow. \u201cA charter flight is a little steep for a \u2018friend\u2019 to pay for. Or is there more going on now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d My face was hot. \u201cGot to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d Rafe examined me closely. \u201cShit, you did it. Finally slept with him, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you blame me? The guy\u2019s like my fantasy man, Rafe!\u201d Yes, I sounded defensive.</p><p>\u201cThe surprise was that it took you so long.\u201d Rafe had a rueful grin. \u201cCome on, Glory. The guy pursued you hard and fast. I knew how you felt about him. You were a fangirl. A total groupie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d I flushed again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d I squeezed his arm, hating the way he looked so serious standing there. \u201cGuess I\u2019d better go. Bye.\u201d He didn\u2019t say another word as I hurried out the door.</p> <p>When I got outside, I stopped and took a minute. Rafe. I would never have a better friend and I hoped he could find someone to make him happy so I didn\u2019t feel so guilty...</p><p>\u201cGet over here before my guy drags you by your hair.\u201d The voice came out of the dark alley next to the club.</p><p>\u201cI thought you had a date.\u201d I strolled over to where Lucky and her two henchmen waited. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to be late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe in making a man wait for me. It gives me an edge.\u201d Lucky raised a coral-painted nail. \u201cNow let me tell you something, Miss Thing. You think you\u2019re all that with your statue trick but I\u2019m serving notice. I\u2019ve had feelers out to find a way around that. I\u2019m taking you down. You hear me? No one messes with Lucky Carver and gets away with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m shaking.\u201d I raised my hands and did mocking jazz hands.</p><p>\u201cYou should be.\u201d Lucky jabbed her fingernail into my chest before I saw it coming. \u201cBitch. You owe me. We had a contract and I want it honored.\u201d</p><p>I was all set to vanish out of there, when I felt an arm around my neck. Damn, her vampire bodyguard had been too quick for me. Aggie had warned me that you couldn\u2019t dematerialize if someone anchored you in place with a touch.</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t want to do that, chica.\u201d He growled it in my ear, his voice low and slightly accented. Hispanic. Probably one of the vamps who\u2019d immigrated here from Mexico. That explained his dark good looks.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d I focused on Lucky. I could still turn her into a statue.</p><p>\u201cFreeze her and I\u2019ll tear your pretty head off. Can\u2019t heal from that, can you?\u201d He chuckled then tightened his grip until I heard a bone crack in my neck.</p><p>\u201cHow do you like that, Glory?\u201d Lucky strutted around me in a victory lap, her glee adding a bounce to her step. \u201cMiguel, you are even better than advertised.\u201d She slid a fingernail down his bicep.</p><p>\u201cTouch me again, Miss Lucky, and I\u2019ll let her go. You would make a fine statue, I think.\u201d Miguel\u2019s deep voice sent shivers through me and stopped Lucky in her tracks.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess I understand our relationship now.\u201d She jerked her hand back. \u201cKill her? Or not? Hmm.\u201d She tapped her fingernail against her fangs, brought down by her excitement. \u201cConsequences would be a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right. There\u2019s the council here for one. They\u2019d hunt you down and terminate you for ordering the hit.\u201d My voice came out hoarse as I tried to find some wiggle room, but Miguel wasn\u2019t about to ease his grip on me. \u201cAnd, Miguel, you\u2019d be toast too. Burned and crispy in the morning sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoubt it. I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d His cheek brushed my hair.</p><p>He smelled masculine with a spicy scent that I would remember if I met it in the dark again. I could feel his hard body pressed against mine and figured he was a good ten inches taller than I was and solid muscle. I might be able to outwit him but he obviously had skills. I\u2019d been so proud of my new Siren status, but a clever vamp could still take me down if I wasn\u2019t careful. I was truly trapped, my only option to think healing thoughts for my throat.</p><p>\u201cYes, I guess you would disappear, Miguel, you were hard enough to track down.\u201d Lucky frowned. \u201cI\u2019m well-known, my business easy to find. It\u2019s a nuisance looking over my shoulder all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it would be a shame to close this territory for you, Miss Lucky.\u201d Nice that he didn\u2019t seem too worried about taking me out. Guess it was true\u2014I had no Siren magic working my wiles on men.</p><p>\u201cTrue enough. And then there\u2019s Glory\u2019s fan club. All those men she\u2019s enthralled with her Siren ways. They\u2019d be after me for revenge too, I\u2019m afraid. What a nuisance. Not that you couldn\u2019t handle them, Miguel.\u201d Lucky sighed. \u201cBut let this be a lesson for you, Glory. Your new power isn\u2019t a match for a strong and fast vampire who knows what you can do and is prepared to deal with it.\u201d She smiled at Miguel. \u201cAnd I can afford to hire the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m releasing you now, chica. Will you behave? I must warn you, this freeze thing of yours\u2014I know how to take it off your victims. So don\u2019t bother doing it to Miss Lucky. And I will stay behind you, I think. As a precaution. Entiendes?\u201d Miguel slowly eased the pressure off my throat and I coughed, then reached up to rub my neck. Unfortunately Miguel kept his hand on my shoulder like the bastard knew I would disappear if he let me go entirely.</p><p>\u201cYes, I get it. Score one for you, Lucky.\u201d Oh, how I wanted to put Lucky in her place. Her gloating was getting to me and I felt my temper rise. Miguel squeezed my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiguel can read through any mind blocking too, Glory. Just like you can. Isn\u2019t that a bitch?\u201d Lucky laughed then and turned her back on me.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I shrugged off Miguel\u2019s hand, surprised when he let me. \u201cI want you out of Austin, Lucky. Forget that so-called contract. You got your down payment back in a timely manner. Our deal is null and void. How do you like that legalese? Why not go back to New York and your homies, where people appreciate your style? Here? We don\u2019t like you and we don\u2019t want to do business with you. That scene with Rafe should have convinced you of that.\u201d</p><p>Lucky stopped and turned around. \u201cYou are one straight-up bitch, you know that?\u201d She smoothed down her black cocktail dress, a little much for Sixth Street but mouth watering, and actually smiled. \u201cI swear we could be friends if I didn\u2019t hate you so damned much. I admire a woman who can stand up to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you know why I won\u2019t ever be your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I\u2019m getting really tired of Texas, if you want to know the truth. So as soon as I get with the handsome Scottish doctor, I\u2019m ditching this place. Maybe I\u2019ll leave Miguel here as my rep. I still have loans out that need collecting and he seems to have a natural talent for intimidation. A wonderful skill, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d Lucky smiled and nodded at him. Yes, he was still way too close at my back.</p><p>\u201cOf course, Miss Lucky. I would be happy to be of service.\u201d Miguel had a cadence to his speech that was almost charming. Too bad his power surrounded me and I wanted to run from him as fast as I could manage.</p><p>\u201cIntimidation. Yeah, he has that, in spades. Adi\u00f3s, Lucky. If I never see you again, it will be too soon. And here\u2019s a parting gift. Your Siren blood isn\u2019t worth shit. If Ian tells you otherwise? He\u2019s lying to you just to get in your pants. But then he wouldn\u2019t have to do that, would he? You\u2019re much too easy for him to bother.\u201d I rubbed my sore neck again, even though I was sure it was already healing courtesy of the synthetic blood I\u2019d just downed at Rafe\u2019s club.</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s the liar? What do you say, Miguel? Is she telling the truth or not?\u201d Lucky stalked up to me like she was about to slap me silly. I hoped she tried.</p><p>\u201cNo lies, Miss Lucky. This one has powers, you do not.\u201d Miguel didn\u2019t sound sorry about it either.</p><p>\u201cWell.\u201d Lucky just stood there, obviously frustrated. \u201cAt least I can afford to buy good help. Good-bye, Glory.\u201d Lucky turned on her Louboutin pumps that I would love to own. Did she travel with a hairdresser? The way her dark red hair tumbled to her shoulders was too perfectly artless. I grinned at the thought of her shifter wielding a round brush and a blow dryer. Why not? I knew better than to stereotype. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Lucky?\u201d She stopped and looked over her shoulder. I realized Miguel had vanished, the empty space behind me a welcome relief. \u201cNews flash. Your Siren blood? Also not worth a damn for attracting men. Sorry about that.\u201d And with a finger wave I concentrated and vanished, sure that I\u2019d left her with a gaping mouth. Hah! I waited until I was a block down in another alley before I rematerialized and went to check on the shop. I\u2019d got what I wanted\u2014Lucky was leaving town. Things were running smoothly at Vintage Vamp\u2019s so I just walked through to get my car from the alley.</p><p>Oh, she did not do this. But I had a feeling she did. I should have known Lucky would find a way to make me pay for slipping out of our contract. My tires were slashed and as flat as Diana\u2019s wallet. I really hated to call in another insurance claim but four new tires... I loved my sassy new car but even the tires were expensive. I walked around the vehicle three times inspecting for other damage. If Lucky had keyed it or broken so much as a taillight, I\u2019d find a way to freeze that bitch into a Lucky-cicle until New Year\u2019s.</p><p>But apparently Lucky had some respect for a fine Italian sports car and had contented herself with ruining the rubber. I decided to let the tires go for tonight and called Erin, asking her to leave a message for the day crew to get the tires taken care of tomorrow. I kicked at one, hurt my toe, then shifted to fly out to Ian\u2019s. This was not how I\u2019d wanted to arrive.</p> <p>He let me in with a smile. I was part of an experiment to him now and Ian loved his experiments.</p><p>\u201cSo, Glory, what have you found out about Sirens? Aggie won\u2019t tell me anything. Claims it\u2019s a sisterhood thing. Not for men to know, if you can believe that.\u201d Ian was in a good mood as he led me into his expansive living room.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right. It is a sisterhood and apparently I made a lucky escape when Achelous kicked me out.\u201d I settled into a comfy chair with a view of one of Austin\u2019s lakes. There was no way I was accepting the glass of premium synthetic he offered me.</p><p>\u201cBut he left you ignorant. Unforgivable not to know you were a Siren. What about the blood? Did you find out if it carries any powers?\u201d Ian picked up an electronic tablet off of a glass coffee table, then settled on the couch.</p><p>\u201cNot a speck.\u201d I jumped to my feet. \u201cAnd, Ian, I don\u2019t appreciate the lies you told me. Clarity? Here\u2019s some for you. That b.s. about drinking my blood and getting off to it was obviously a ploy. A way to drive a wedge between me and Jerry, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGlory, how can you say that? I told you. The feud is ancient history. And Penny took the drug. She gave you her statement.\u201d Ian looked like he wanted to smile.</p><p>\u201cGet her in here. I want to interview her about that little experiment.\u201d I sat again. Lying bastard. \u201cDamn it, Ian, if you laugh at me, I\u2019ll show you a power that will make you very uncomfortable.\u201d I entertained myself with visions of Ian as a garden gnome. \u201cAnd look at my face! You slipped me another drug and now I\u2019m wearing a permanent flush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalm down, Gloriana. That night you were overwrought. I thought I was doing the right thing. And I might have a cure for your residual redness. If you\u2019re willing to take another drug.\u201d Ian got serious. \u201cForgive me. As a doctor, I always turn to medicine as a cure.\u201d</p><p>I settled back in my chair. \u201cNo more drugs. Now call Penny in here. I know she was supposed to work tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she\u2019s here.\u201d Ian\u2019s finger hovered over his tablet. \u201cBut first won\u2019t you tell me what powers you got as a former Siren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear me? I\u2019m furious with you. You drugged me. Lied to me. I do have some of the powers the Sirens have, but I\u2019m sure not sharing anything with you.\u201d</p> <p>Ian tapped the tablet. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll get Penny.\u201d He walked over to an intercom and buzzed another room, asking for her to join us.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Glory?\u201d Penny smiled at me as she walked into the room. She wore a white lab coat over her jeans and T-shirt, looking cute and very professional.</p><p>\u201cI want to show Ian that I\u2019m on to him. You remember when he let you have that dose of Clarity? Supposedly made from my blood?\u201d I frowned at Ian. \u201cExperimenting on Penny. So not cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. Penny is a scientist. She was a willing subject, weren\u2019t you, my dear?\u201d Ian put his hand on her shoulder.</p><p>Penny jerked away from Ian when I nodded. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018supposedly\u2019? What did you do, Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, I made a drug from Gloriana\u2019s blood. She\u2019s here making wild accusations, just because she and Campbell apparently broke up.\u201d Ian smiled. \u201cNot my fault, Gloriana. The man is a hothead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d I couldn\u2019t resist. I froze Ian with a look. He stood there, his eyes burning and not able to move a muscle. \u201cHow do you like that Siren power, Ian?\u201d I turned to Penny. \u201cNow remind me exactly how you felt after you took Clarity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had hyper vision, hearing and an enhanced libido.\u201d Penny flushed. \u201cIt was really cool and a breakthrough drug.\u201d She glanced at Ian. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that, Glory. I can tell Ian\u2019s furious. When he thaws, he can call in his guards and you\u2019ll be outnumbered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo worries. I have more tricks I can play. And he can\u2019t be mad at you. I\u2019m the villain here.\u201d I tapped Ian on his chest. I read his thoughts. Wow. He was steamed. Being helpless was like his worst nightmare. He and Jerry were more alike than they\u2019d ever admit.</p><p>\u201cNow I want you to drink some of my blood. Straight from the source, Penny.\u201d I held out my wrist. \u201cJust enough to be sure you have a good sampling. Then we\u2019ll see what effects it has on you, won\u2019t we, Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? It was kind of embarrassing the first time. I was so horny.\u201d Penny looked at her feet. \u201cWell, let\u2019s just say I shifted over to N-V and dragged Trey into a supply closet. He was thrilled but I was mortified.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cNo worries. I have a feeling none of that will happen this time. What do you say, Ian? Oh, I forgot, you can\u2019t talk.\u201d I concentrated and thawed just his head. \u201cNow you can comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloriana, you will regret this. Thaw me out this instant.\u201d I swear spittle came out of his mouth Ian was so enraged.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not. Come on, Penny.\u201d I sat on the couch and held out my wrist then patted the seat next to me. \u201cHave at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPenny, ignore her. She is trying to make you look foolish.\u201d Ian made this sound like an order.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an experiment, boss. I think I should do it. In the interest of science, don\u2019t you know.\u201d Penny sat and took my hand. \u201cHere goes.\u201d She bit into my wrist delicately, like she was afraid she\u2019d hurt me. \u201cMmm.\u201d She sent me a mental message that I tasted great.</p><p>I timed her then pushed her away and told her to lick the punctures closed. \u201cOkay, how do you feel?\u201d</p><p>Penny looked around the room. \u201cSight\u2019s normal. Say something, Glory. No, let me listen and see if I can hear the guards outside. Last time, I could hear conversations from a block away.\u201d She screwed up her face, concentrating. \u201cNope. No luck.\u201d Then she sat back on the couch and looked Ian over. Uh-oh.</p><p>\u201cPenny, if you value your job...\u201d Ian growled.</p><p>\u201cSorry, boss, but you\u2019re not my type. I\u2019m in love with my shifter and I am not in the throes of lust like I was after I took Clarity, whatever that was.\u201d Penny turned to me. \u201cGlory, you\u2019re right. It wasn\u2019t made with your blood. You\u2019ve got rich, delicious vampire blood, but it\u2019s not an aphrodisiac.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d I got up and felt her get up beside me. \u201cIan obviously has created a new drug that he can market but it\u2019s nothing to do with me. Right, Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d He lifted his chin. \u201cPenny, don\u2019t you have work to do in the lab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I do.\u201d She pulled off her lab coat. \u201cI can\u2019t work here anymore. Not when I\u2019m used to deceive my friends.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s face was a thundercloud. \u201cYou won\u2019t find another job like this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not.\u201d She took my arm. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here, Glory.\u201d</p><p>I was proud of my fledgling but worried that Ian would retaliate in some way. \u201cHold up a minute. Ian, you will give Penny a good recommendation, won\u2019t you? I don\u2019t think the council would like to hear about your deceptive practices here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never sold Clarity, Glory. It was just a little experiment.\u201d Ian frowned at both of us. \u201cBut she is an excellent scientist. Don\u2019t be impulsive, Penny. We can surely work something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks. I have some money saved and some time to think about options. Maybe I\u2019ll just hang out with Glory in her shop for a while.\u201d Penny smiled at me, pretty relaxed for someone who\u2019d just given up her dream job.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019m heading to Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotland?\u201d Penny wasn\u2019t in any hurry to leave. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Ian seemed interested in the answer too.</p><p>\u201cJerry\u2019s gone home to the family castle. Since he left, I found out that only a Siren\u2019s song can enthrall a man and, when we met, I didn\u2019t have one, thanks to Achelous. I need to tell Jer that. To relieve his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could do that with a simple telephone call.\u201d Ian smirked. \u201cEven the primitive Campbells have cell phone service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, we didn\u2019t part on good terms. Thanks to your interference.\u201d I hated Ian\u2019s amused expression, like he was above my little love drama. \u201cI feel the need for a face-to-face.\u201d</p><p>Ian made a noise. Was he laughing? That brought my chin up.</p><p>\u201cFine. Maybe I\u2019ll beg for his forgiveness. Though what I did, I have no idea.\u201d I sighed and let my shoulders slump. \u201cObviously I have no pride where Jerry\u2019s concerned.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAw, Glory, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Penny put her arms around me. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to go after the man you love. If Blade\u2019s got any sense, he\u2019ll be hoping you do that very thing.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cCirce put him in my path, but I had no song to bind him. He fell in love with me on his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you go. You\u2019re irresistible.\u201d Penny glanced at Ian, obviously thinking he didn\u2019t need in on this conversation.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Penny.\u201d I patted her back. \u201cI hope you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a safe trip.\u201d She stood and walked toward the labs. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get my stuff together.\u201d She stopped in the doorway. \u201cHow are you getting there anyway? I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s easy for a vampire to negotiate such a long distance with the time differences and the death sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay\u2019s chartered a flight for me.\u201d I couldn\u2019t look at Ian this time.</p><p>He laughed loudly. \u201cOh, there you go. That will cap it off for Campbell. He\u2019ll figure out what you had to do to get a plane from Caine and wash his hands of you, my girl. See if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d He wore jeans and a knit shirt tonight but I could imagine him in a kilt, attacking the Campbell fortress. \u201cYou may well get that castle door slammed in your pretty face, Gloriana. And if you\u2019ve ever turned the man into a statue like you\u2019ve done to me, it\u2019s a certainty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks a heap, Ian. Ray and I are friends. He\u2019s chartering the flight for me as a favor. I hope Jerry can understand that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust friends, Glory?\u201d Ray stood in the doorway. \u201cYou can tell Ian the truth. We\u2019re more than friends and you didn\u2019t think I was going to let you get on that plane by yourself, did you?\u201d</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Ray turned to me as soon as Penny made her excuses and hurried out of the room. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you froze Ian. You have a death wish, Glory?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Ian. \u201cI had some things I needed to say. Now I guess I\u2019d better thaw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s past time.\u201d Ian looked like he was going for my throat as soon as I did.</p><p>Ray was on his cell phone. I saw why as soon as his bodyguard, Will Kilpatrick, came into the room. He was a Scot Ray had hired who happened to be from a clan near Jerry\u2019s. He was also brother to the mother of Jerry\u2019s child, but I liked him anyway.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this now?\u201d Will grinned at me. \u201cRumors are flying among the guards. Did you do this, Gloriana?\u201d He came over to kiss my cheek. \u201cAh, lassie, \u2019tis a fine skill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but now what?\u201d I smiled at Ray. \u201cThanks for the backup, Ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan, I\u2019m a valuable customer. Glory is leaving town for a while. And you know the council won\u2019t stand for you hurting her. Neither will I. Can she thaw you now without reprisals?\u201d Ray motioned to Will and he stood beside me, stake at the ready.</p><p>\u201cNo need for violence. Glory proved a point. I had a little fun at her expense. It\u2019s over now and we\u2019re done. I want nothing more to do with her.\u201d Ian\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cJust get me the fuck out of this, Gloriana. Now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really hear an apology.\u201d I felt Ray squeeze my hand. Okay, so Ian had a dozen guards he could call in. \u201cFine.\u201d I thawed him then braced myself.</p><p>Ian just strode around the room, obviously testing his freedom, then stopped to write something in his tablet.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch but I hated that! Wish I could do it myself though.\u201d He glared at me like it was my fault that I couldn\u2019t transfer the power.</p><p>\u201cDid she tell you she can also blast through your mental blocks when you\u2019re trying to hide your thoughts?\u201d Ray threw himself into a chair. \u201cThat one\u2019s a real pisser.\u201d</p> <p>Ian blanched and frowned at me. I gave him a finger wave with a smile, not even pretending I hadn\u2019t poked around in his brain.</p><p>Ray gestured at his bodyguard. \u201cWill, you can go back outside now. Disaster averted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. MacDonald, is he right?\u201d Will waited until Ian nodded. \u201cToo bad. While you were standing there frozen, I had a chance with my stake. But it wasn\u2019t to be.\u201d He ignored Ian\u2019s growl. \u201cGlory, good to see you. Glad you and Ray here finally hooked up. Though I\u2019m sure Blade wouldn\u2019t agree.\u201d He winked at me. \u201cDon\u2019t see anyone\u2019s ring on your finger, though, do I, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill, aren\u2019t you supposed to be outside sharpening that stake or something?\u201d I really didn\u2019t need to hear Jerry\u2019s name right now.</p><p>\u201cSure. Guard duty. I\u2019m on it. Just one more thing.\u201d Will stopped in the doorway. \u201cMacDonald, Blade sent ye a message from the homeland.\u201d He said something in Gaelic that Ian obviously took exception to. Will grinned and saluted before taking off.</p><p>\u201cMight be time to let that slacker go.\u201d Ray grumbled.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more.\u201d Ian threw down his tablet. \u201cI assume you\u2019re here for the daylight drug, Ray. I\u2019ll go get your order.\u201d He left the room after sending a last angry look my way. An effort to read his thoughts just got me a bunch of indecipherable Gaelic. Ian had obviously switched languages, my hopelessness with any languages other than English no secret.</p><p>\u201cI wonder what Will said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter. I won\u2019t fire him. He\u2019s a hell of an Xbox player and we have a tournament going. He\u2019s on my team against Nate and one of the other guards.\u201d Ray smiled ruefully at me. \u201cNo comment on the plane trip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s wait until we\u2019re out of here for that discussion.\u201d I sat on the arm of his chair. Before I could stop him, he\u2019d pulled me into his lap. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ray, that you walked into the middle of that. But have to say I wasn\u2019t sure how it was going to play out.\u201d I didn\u2019t let him know I could have vanished out of there.</p><p>\u201cGlad to help. Ian was certainly pissed. Please don\u2019t do that to me. Not sure I could take it.\u201d He pulled me close, my head snug against his chest. I inhaled, savoring his nearness and realizing again how much he meant to me.</p><p>What was wrong with me that I could have such strong feelings for three different men? And be willing to use them so shamelessly? Because I had to talk Ray out of going with me on that plane yet it seemed like I was going to let him foot the bill. If I could pay him back somehow... Oh, sure. How many thousands of dollars did a charter flight cost? I\u2019d end up like Diana, drowning in debt.</p><p>But I\u2019d let Jerry pay for bodyguards for hundreds of years. Obviously using men was Siren behavior, I just hadn\u2019t known that\u2019s where it had come from. It was past time I let it go. I didn\u2019t want to be that person anymore, always taking.</p><p>\u201cMy, oh my. Look at the cozy couple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up, Glory,\u201d Ray growled in my ear.</p><p>\u201cNo. Ignore her, Ray. Lucky, go away.\u201d I noticed she hadn\u2019t brought her bodyguards in with her.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? Ian\u2019s expecting me. We have a date.\u201d She tossed her hair then smiled. \u201cHey, Ray. How\u2019s immortality treating you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlory, I\u2019m about to dump you on your pretty behind.\u201d Ray stood and dropped me on the chair. \u201cLucky, I figure you don\u2019t give a shit about me and my immortality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do. Didn\u2019t Glory tell you? I\u2019m sorry, Ray. I\u2019ve had time to think since I did the deed. Maybe I was hasty, turning you like that.\u201d Lucky was smart enough to keep the couch between her and Ray, especially when Ray stepped closer to her.</p><p>\u201cMaybe? You hadn\u2019t seen me in what?\u2014decades\u2014and you rip out my throat and make me vampire on a fuckin\u2019 whim?\u201d Ray stalked her, fangs down, following her when she backed away from him. \u201cNow \u2018Sorry\u2019 is supposed to clear the air? Some things are unforgivable, Lucky. You with me on that, Glory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay, settle down. It can\u2019t be undone so there\u2019s no point in\u2014\u201d I stood behind him, trying to find the magic words to calm him down. He kept his eyes narrowed on Lucky like he was ready to spring.</p><p>\u201cIn what? Taking revenge? But it would feel so damned good.\u201d Ray jerked a stake out of his back pocket and Lucky and I both gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing? Vampires don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Lucky\u2019s eyes were saucers and she\u2019d backed up until she hit a wall. A painting that had hung there fell to the floor with a crash. I figured the only reason that Ian hadn\u2019t come running was because he was somewhere enjoying the show.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stake each other? You wish. I figure sending you to hell would be a public service, Lucky.\u201d Ray\u2019s hand was steady as he aimed the stake at Lucky\u2019s heart. There was still a leather chair between them but I knew it would be an easy leap for him to be on her.</p><p>\u201cRay, the council won\u2019t stand for this. You know the penalty for taking out another vampire.\u201d I kept my hand on his back, willing him to listen to me.</p><p>\u201cLet them try to find me.\u201d His smile was wry. \u201cI have the resources to live wherever the hell I please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t run with you.\u201d I squeezed his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll miss you like hell, sweet thing, but that threat won\u2019t stop me. And I\u2019m warning you, Glory. If you freeze me now, I\u2019ll never forgive you. You hear me?\u201d Ray\u2019s voice was cold and I believed him.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do that to you, Ray. This is your decision. But she\u2019s just not worth it. You\u2019ve made a decent life here. I can\u2019t bear the thought of you bringing it down over this worthless bitch.\u201d I leaned my face against his shirt, too sick and terrified to cry.</p><p>\u201cFreeze him, Glory. I know you can do it.\u201d Lucky\u2019s voice wobbled and I realized she was actually scared.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I rubbed his back, absorbing his pain, hurt and fury. If I were still a killer, a real Siren, I\u2019d take her out for him. Obviously I was damned anyway. No wonder Lucifer had been drawn to me, wanted me for himself. I swallowed nausea at the thought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But I knew Ray wasn\u2019t the cold-blooded killer he thought he could be and regret would haunt him later. I held on to him, feeling the thrum of his tension in the set of his shoulders. How could I help him?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s all yours, Ray. Make your choice.\u201d I raked her with my eyes and pinned her where she stood.</p><p>\u201cYou froze her.\u201d Ray turned and faced me. \u201cI can stake her now and she can\u2019t get away from me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. So make a decision. Do it and ruin everything. Or let her go. Lucky\u2019s promised to leave town. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be interested in coming back.\u201d I sucked in a breath. It took everything in me not to fall to my knees and beg him to do the right thing.</p><p>I\u2019d left Lucky\u2019s eyes mobile and she blinked frantically as if to say she was more than ready to get out of Austin. Ray glanced at her then back to me again.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t deserve to live, Glory.\u201d His voice was low as he leaned his forehead against mine. \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of doing this ever since...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, Ray. I do.\u201d I slid my hands up to his face, running my thumbs over the stubble of his evening beard. \u201cLook at me. Please.\u201d He leaned back and it took me a moment to collect my thoughts. \u201cI love you, Ray. Enough to step back and let you take her out if that\u2019s what you need to do. But please let Lucky go.\u201d I felt his jaw tighten under my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cGlory...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it for me, Ray, do it for yourself. You\u2019re vampire. Done deal. We can\u2019t turn back the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem, babe.\u201d He looked down at the stake, the sharp point too close to his own lean stomach in its dark T-shirt. \u201cWhat she did... I can\u2019t be mortal again. God knows I\u2019ve done everything in my power to try to figure out a way...\u201d He met my gaze again. \u201cSorry, but you know how I feel about losing daylight. If I\u2019d had a choice, like you did... Shit. But I didn\u2019t.\u201d He gritted his teeth. \u201cShe took the choice out of my hands and that\u2019s what I just can\u2019t accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, accept this, Israel Caine.\u201d I gripped his hand that held that stake. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck. Get over it.\u201d I sighed and kissed his cheek. \u201cI\u2019d hoped you\u2019d become used to this life enough by now to realize how much it\u2019s brought you\u2014immortality, strength, enhanced senses. Damn it, love the night, Ray, and quit fighting against it. Find the beauty and stop mourning what you can\u2019t freakin\u2019 have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d One arm went around me and he took a breath as he held me for a long moment. Finally he looked at me again. \u201cGuess I have turned into a whiny SOB, haven\u2019t I?\u201d Ray\u2019s mouth worked until he managed a slight smile. \u201cBut I want to kill her so damned bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. She\u2019s done horrible, unforgivable things. But I\u2019ve got to believe that somewhere down the line she\u2019ll get what she deserves. Divine justice. What goes around, comes around. Karma. Whatever you want to call it I\u2019m pretty sure Lucky will get hers in the end. Can\u2019t we leave it at that?\u201d I took the stake from his fingers, surprised when he let me. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Ray. That\u2019s just one reason I love you, whines and all. What say we let her go now and then get the hell out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I want to hold you, be with you, before you leave. And, no, I\u2019m not going with you. There\u2019s nothing for me in Scotland. But I\u2019ll send Will with you. How\u2019s that?\u201d He kissed me sweetly, then hungrily. \u201cDamn, Glory. I can\u2019t believe I let you talk me out of this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNeither can I.\u201d Ian walked into the room with a small package. \u201cDaylight drug. Now go stand by the terrace doors, then release Ms. Carver, Gloriana. I\u2019ll deal with the fallout.\u201d Ian nodded toward Lucky. \u201cI\u2019ve got a note here for Campbell. An answer to the message passed by Kilpatrick. Will you take it for me?\u201d He held out a small sealed envelope.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to aggravate the feud, is it? I don\u2019t trust you.\u201d I stared down at it. I was too anxious about Ray right now to get into Ian\u2019s thoughts. I was pretty sure they were still in that indecipherable Gaelic anyway, the note too. I awkwardly held that stake, not about to hand it to Ian, though I was desperate to be rid of it.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t if Campbell is reasonable.\u201d Ian smiled like he doubted that. \u201cGood luck.\u201d He nodded at Ray. \u201cI\u2019ll see you another night. Enjoy your daylight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always do. Now if you get the urge to poison that bitch\u201d\u2014Ray glanced at Lucky\u2014\u201cgo with it. No great loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beginning to see that some people think so. Please just take off. Gloriana?\u201d Ian raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s thawed.\u201d I stuck the note in my bra then ran out the door behind Ray. We shifted, only stopping long enough to get Will from the front lawn where I handed him the stake. Then we headed toward Ray\u2019s house.</p><p>When we got there it was quiet and Ray pulled me into the dark living room.</p><p>\u201cI have a question for you,\u201d I said before he could drag me down the hall to either the playroom or the bedroom.</p> <p>\u201cShoot.\u201d Ray faced me, not even trying to evade the showdown.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell were you doing carrying a stake?\u201d I paced the length of the room.</p><p>\u201cI started the night you told me Lucky was in town.\u201d He sat at the piano and stared down at the keys. \u201cWhat did you expect? I hate her. The fact that she was here and I could run into her was eating me alive, Glory. I figured she was still gloating about what she did to me. I had to do something about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told you she regretted it, Ray. She isn\u2019t gloating and I believe her.\u201d I sat next to him. \u201cYou have any idea how dangerous it is to have a stake on you? You\u2019re still a relatively new vampire. What if someone had overpowered you? Or frozen you, like I can do? They could take that stake and use it against you, Ray.\u201d I bumped against his shoulder. \u201cPlease promise me you won\u2019t do that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries.\u201d He played a bar or two of scary music. \u201cI\u2019ll let Will handle it from now on. That\u2019s what I pay him for.\u201d He smiled.</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d I laid my hands on top of his.</p><p>He turned his hands over and gripped mine then stared into my eyes. \u201cYou sure you need to go to Scotland? I think we\u2019ve got a good thing going right here. You really came through for me back there. I could feel the love.\u201d He pulled me to him, holding me almost too tight. \u201cDamn, girl, I seriously felt all that emotion from you just lift me right out of my anger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping...\u201d I held on to him and rubbed my face against his shoulder. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear it if you self-destructed, Ray. But, like I said, don\u2019t do anything for me, do it for yourself. You\u2019re worth it. Believe that if you believe nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. This sounds like a good-bye speech.\u201d He leaned back and smiled sadly. \u201cYou leaving now? Tonight? Without...\u201d</p><p>I put my fingers over his lips. \u201cI can\u2019t take your plane. It\u2019s not fair. And I\u2019m not taking Will either. I\u2019ll get to Scotland on my own somehow. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo plane. Then how...?\u201d Ray brushed my hair back. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to know. Just promise me you won\u2019t shape-shift and try to fly yourself over the Atlantic as a bird or bat or something. That\u2019s too much for anyone but one of those macho types like Blade. And I bet even he has pit stops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t try to do that. A girl\u2019s got to have luggage, you know.\u201d I leaned against him again. I knew I had made the right decision.</p><p>\u201cOkay. You\u2019re smart. You\u2019ll figure it out. You need cash\u2014\u201d He didn\u2019t get to finish that offer with my hand over his mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m through with what I\u2019ve figured out is Siren behavior, Ray.\u201d I stopped and shook my head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s an excuse. I\u2019m through being a user. Especially men. Jerry, Rafe, now you. No money, bodyguards, plane rides.\u201d This was like stepping off a cliff, no safety net, no bottom in sight. But I pasted on a confident smile, glad Ray couldn\u2019t blast through my mental blocks.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, be careful.\u201d He pulled me close. \u201cAnd to hell with this independence shit. If you get in real trouble, call me. Promise.\u201d He looked deadly serious and waited until I nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I promise. But it\u2019ll have to be a dire emergency.\u201d I smiled at his palpable relief.</p><p>\u201cQuit beating yourself up about this so-called Siren behavior, Glory.\u201d Ray frowned. \u201cMen like me, the Scot, and, yeah, even your faithful hound, want to do things for you. Because we love you. You\u2019re not like Aggie, not by any stretch. She\u2019s obviously out for whatever she can get.\u201d He rubbed my arms as he kept his eyes on mine. \u201cYou have a generous heart, a spirit that makes you a great friend.\u201d He finally smiled. \u201cAnd a helluva lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRay.\u201d My voice cracked. \u201cI wish...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it. I know you have to go do your thing with Blade. I\u2019d like to blame it on the sire/fledgling connection but I sure don\u2019t have that with Lucky.\u201d Ray smiled sadly. \u201cSo kiss me good-bye and make it a good one.\u201d Ray leaned down and took my mouth.</p><p>Ray made sure he left his mark on me, his mouth a master class in seduction that tempted me to pull him down the hall for a last romp on his satin sheets. Instead, I slipped from his arms and walked out to his terrace.</p><p>\u201cRay, you won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back to the booze?\u201d He smiled and shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve got the itch to write a song. Pretty gloomy stuff but, hey, that\u2019s my mood, you know?\u201d He rubbed my shoulder then frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a bruise on your neck, what\u2019s that about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. A little accident earlier. It\u2019s healing.\u201d I was afraid if I told Ray about Lucky\u2019s new bodyguard he\u2019d feel compelled to go after him and even the score. I didn\u2019t want them to go to war over me, especially if Miguel was going to stay in town and take over Lucky\u2019s \u201cterritory.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll expect your new song to be finished when I get back. Just don\u2019t go all The Phantom of the Opera on me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He laughed, loud and long, hugging me until I gasped. \u201cOh, babe, you so have me pegged. I figured I\u2019d go skulking around the lake in a black satin cape. Not sure about the mask.\u201d</p><p>I grinned and traced his smile with a fingertip. \u201cNo, a mask would be a crime. You\u2019re too pretty for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not pretty enough to keep you here?\u201d He nipped my finger with a fang.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to do this, Ray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you come back?\u201d He leaned against the railing, back to the lake. \u201cWhat if Blade wants you to stay there with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a shop here. A life. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d I turned to look out at the lake. \u201cAnd Jerry\u2019s parents live at the castle.\u201d I shuddered. \u201cWe aren\u2019t exactly best buds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir loss.\u201d Ray leaned over and kissed my cheek. \u201cTake care, Glory girl. Promise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You do the same.\u201d I watched him head inside then heard the piano. It was a sad melody, but beautiful. I walked down to his boat dock just as Ray started to sing. He\u2019d be in his own world now, writing down the melody, adjusting the lyrics. I envied him that creative ability.</p> <p>I stopped to stare out at the lake. I\u2019d miss this, even if the water did still terrify. When the water rippled and a head emerged, I wasn\u2019t even surprised.</p><p>\u201cGlory, you\u2019ve got to come with me. To the other side of this lake.\u201d Aggie pulled herself up onto the dock. She was naked and didn\u2019t bother to cover herself. If I\u2019d had her perfect body, I\u2019d have flaunted it too.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I stepped back when she reached for me with a wet hand. Aggie actually looked desperate as she flung her hair behind her back. Too much of a good thing if you know what I mean. I looked away to peer at the dark lake.</p><p>\u201cAchelous is meeting all the Siren sisters and Circe at Ray\u2019s old house in a few minutes. Please. This is our chance for freedom and it was your idea. You have to be there to help us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? He\u2019ll kill me.\u201d I backed away from her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not giving you a choice.\u201d And with that she grabbed me and jerked me into the water.</p> <p>Nineteen</p><p>I\u2019m sure they heard my scream on every side of the lake. That is before water rushed into my mouth. After that I just concentrated on keeping my head up. Aggie had morphed into her half-fish form, what mortals called a mermaid. She was cutting through the water at warp speed and dragging me by one arm. Obviously she didn\u2019t care how I fared as I hit the waves behind her.</p><p>I sent her a mental message to bleepin\u2019 slow down. That earned me a laugh and a leap into the air that made me gasp and swallow a half gallon of lake when we hit the water again. My curses were drowned out when she did a deep dive that reminded me I didn\u2019t have to breathe at all. Oh, yeah, we were having a great time.</p><p>When we surfaced again I could see the burned-out shell of Ray\u2019s old dock in the distance. Thank the goddess. Geez, now I was even thinking like Aggie. Just as well since I was about to meet the sisters. I shuddered to imagine a whole gaggle of Sirens. If I lived through this picnic, I was shifting and flying home. Good idea. I tried to shift right then and felt a burning sensation that meant my circuits were down. Weird and totally a new feeling that made me want to throw up all that lake water.</p><p>\u201cOkay, put down your feet. You can walk in from here.\u201d Aggie stopped and gave herself legs again.</p><p>To my relief I could touch down, though the bodysurfing adventure had me staggering. I looked back but couldn\u2019t even see the shore or the lights from Ray\u2019s house. I hoped he hadn\u2019t heard my shriek and jumped into his cigarette boat thinking to rescue me. No way did I want him to meet Achelous. But if Laurie showed up and went tiger... Well, it was a nice fantasy anyway.</p><p>I made an ungraceful landing on the rocky shore, scraped my knee and tore a hole in my favorite black pants. I\u2019d lost my slingbacks in the lake and the rocks bit into the soles of my feet as I staggered behind Aggie. At least it looked like we were the first to arrive. I wrung out my hair as I collapsed on a nearby boulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat a wimp.\u201d Aggie dragged my top down where it had ridden up to expose my tummy. \u201cI wish you could do that thing where you make yourself dry clothes. You look horrible.\u201d She, of course, had already put herself into a fresh outfit and had dried and fluffed her hair.</p> <p>\u201cAs if I care.\u201d I did close my eyes and give the transformation thing a shot. Dry hair, a new pair of designer jeans like Aggie wore and a sweater to match my eyes would be swell. I looked down. No go. Screw it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look appealing for the Storm God anyway.\u201d I wiped my face with my hands and saw black mascara on them.</p><p>Aggie just shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Stick with the pitiful look. You\u2019ve got raccoon eyes, no lipstick and could be a drowned reject from The Biggest Loser. Achy won\u2019t give you a second glance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Oh, hello, looks like we have company.\u201d Ghostly figures began to materialize around us. The sisters, I assumed. As I watched they solidified into beautiful women, perfect in every way. They were all different heights and color combos, but their figures were poster worthy. Thank God they hadn\u2019t arrived naked since I didn\u2019t think I could take so much blatant beauty on full display. Instead, they were dressed fit to kill\u2014oops, bad analogy. But obviously these get-togethers were an excuse to try to outdress each other. The clothing budgets they had boggled my mind as they greeted each other with hugs, then gathered around me.</p><p>\u201cGloriana.\u201d They breathed my name then poked and prodded me as if to test for doneness. I just let it go. If I\u2019d once looked like a member of this club, no wonder they were having a hard time believing their eyes. One of them burst into noisy sobs.</p><p>\u201cAriane, please. Nothing can be done now. Forget about it.\u201d Several of the sisters clustered around her.</p><p>\u201cBut we were best friends and she doesn\u2019t even know me.\u201d Ariane, the one who could cry and her eyes and nose didn\u2019t even turn pink, approached me. She rocked a turquoise silk wrap dress and peep-toe lizard pumps as she picked her way across the beach. \u201cGloriana, you really don\u2019t recognize me?\u201d She held out her hand. \u201cPlease, take my hand. I want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, but as far as I can remember, we\u2019ve never met.\u201d I did like her smile. She seemed friendly with her pretty dark eyes and deep dimples. She was a brunette and petite, about Flo\u2019s size. In fact, she reminded me of Flo and I think my best bud had that same dress in yellow. Which gave me the heebie-jeebies. I took a chance and let her hold my hand.</p><p>Suddenly pictures formed in my mind. This girl and I laughed on a beach and then dove into the waves. We weren\u2019t shy and both swam naked, which seemed to be the Siren preference. I guess we did it so we could sprout our fish tails when we felt like it. But I seemed to have the same perfect body she had. My hip issues were another reason to hate Achelous.</p><p>Like switching channels, we were suddenly in another scene, in a palace at the bottom of the sea. We were at a banquet and sat, down the table from Achelous. He gestured to us and we went to him together. We laughed behind his back but were happy to serve him. This time we wore sheer togas that left nothing to the imagination. Our jewelry was heavy and worth a fortune. Hmm. For dessert we did things to and with Achy and each other... I flushed and jerked my hand from hers.</p><p>\u201cDid you see? How close we were, Gloriana?\u201d Ariane\u2019s eyes shimmered.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m sorry. I really don\u2019t remember any of my Siren past. I hope you found another friend.\u201d I stiffened when she threw her arms around me and hugged me.</p><p>\u201cUp to your old tricks, I see, Gloriana. Keep your hands off my women.\u201d Achelous roared the order and the heavens shook with his displeasure.</p><p>\u201cSire, she did not willingly touch me. We were just...\u201d Ariane bowed and scurried back to join her sisters clustered on the other side of the clearing.</p><p>\u201cI had tricks? Didn\u2019t know. But then you did erase my memories.\u201d I knew I should keep my mouth shut but I hated the way the sisters quaked at the sound of his voice. Even now he froze Ariane where she stood before he stalked over to place a proprietary hand on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYes. And I can do it to any one of you females here. Do you doubt me?\u201d Achelous actually spoke softly this time and it was even scarier than his thunder. Of course the crack of a lightning bolt helped punctuate his threat.</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019ve suffered enough at your hands, Achelous.\u201d Circe shimmered into view with her usual display of clear skies and twinkling stars.</p><p>\u201cWhat business is it of yours how I treat my Sirens? Why are you here?\u201d Achelous looked ready to start storming.</p><p>\u201cYour Sirens begged me to intervene. They\u2019ve asked for my help.\u201d Circe\u2019s smile was obviously meant to goad Achelous and it did the job. He whirled and pinned me with a gaze of pure hatred.</p><p>\u201cI know where this is coming from. Gloriana, have you been meddling? Inciting my Sirens to rebellion? I thought I heard whispers when I was at play.\u201d He jerked Aggie to his side with a harsh word. \u201cConfess. Has Gloriana been filling your head with seditious plots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame Gloriana, Achelous. You are high-handed. Ill suited to rule a group of women like the sisterhood of Sirens. Your methods are abusive.\u201d Circe opened her arms. \u201cCome to me, ladies, and I will see that you are well treated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You think to steal them from me?\u201d Achelous\u2019s face turned red. \u201cTake one step, you ungrateful bunch of females, and I will strip the song from each of you.\u201d This stopped the women in their expensive tracks and they sank to their knees in the dirt. I gasped. Designer clothes deserved better. But of course he\u2019d pull out that trump card.</p><p>\u201cYou will not.\u201d Circe waved her arms and a golden band of twinkling stars shimmered around the ladies. What? Were we in a Disney movie? But obviously this was a power move because Achelous looked ready to spit sparks.</p><p>\u201cThe Sirens are under my protection until we get this settled. Don\u2019t think I won\u2019t go to Zeus about this, Achelous. The very fact that the Sirens asked me to take them on will displease him. He\u2019s already unhappy that you and I need him to mediate our disputes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is way more than a dispute, Circe. You are interfering in my territory.\u201d Flames did shoot out of his eyes as he stared at her. \u201cWoman, I will never forget this, no matter what Zeus decides.\u201d Achy stomped his sandaled foot and thunder and lightning filled the night. He pointed at me and electricity made my hair swirl around my head. \u201cI lay this entire debacle on your head, Gloriana. My ladies were perfectly content until Aglaophonos began consorting with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContent? How could they be?\u201d I studied the women who still looked terrified. \u201cYou send them out to kill and then reward them by demanding they satisfy your every appetite.\u201d I tried to stand but gave up the effort, my legs still rubbery.</p><p>\u201cMouthy bitch. You will regret this, Gloriana.\u201d Achelous raised his hand and a lightning bolt tore through my pants and pinned my leg to the rock where I sat.</p> <p>Dear God but I\u2019d never felt such pain. The world darkened and I smelled burned flesh and my own blood welling from the hole in my leg. I reached shaking hands to pull out the pulsing light shard but realized it wasn\u2019t solid, but a high-voltage missile that I couldn\u2019t grab no matter how hard I tried.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Circe commanded.</p><p>Achelous ignored her, making the stones beneath us shake with his fury before opening the skies to a freezing rain. I screamed when he tossed another bolt at me, this time through my other leg. I couldn\u2019t have moved even if I hadn\u2019t felt like I was being electrocuted from the thighs up. My nails shredded as I dug for purchase on the hard rock and tried to keep from falling back and ripping the lightning down the length of my legs.</p><p>For the first time, I wished Achelous had turned me into a statue. I bit my lip, damned if I\u2019d give him the satisfaction of tears or pleas for mercy. I kept my chin up and my eyes fixed on him.</p><p>\u201cHaving fun?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou mock me?\u201d Achelous looked like he was winding up for another round.</p><p>I had some things I wanted to say before he put me down even if the pain was making it hard for me to think straight. I glanced at the sisters now clustered behind Circe. They were safe, at least, behind their twinkling barricade. I noticed that not even Achelous\u2019s rain could penetrate that circle of stars and they were dry and pretty as they stared at me in horror. Aggie was still a statue, trapped behind Achelous.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d like to blame me for the Sirens\u2019 defection but blame yourself, your high and mightiness. They saw what you did to me and decided they couldn\u2019t take a chance that one day you\u2019d have performance issues or whatever and give one of them the same treatment. These women are too smart to just wait for the ax to fall.\u201d I licked my lips, tasting the rain and wishing it was something stronger. I needed to heal and fast. The lightning in my thighs pulsed hot and I leaned back to try to ease the pressure. No such luck.</p><p>\u201cSmart?\u201d Achelous snorted. \u201cSirens aren\u2019t valued for their brains, Gloriana. Or their clever conversation.\u201d That got a reaction from the ladies but he ignored it. He looked me over. \u201cThere are uses for a Siren\u2019s mouth and talking isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really are a Neanderthal.\u201d It was getting harder for me to form words. God, but I wanted to leap across the clearing and show him how a vampire\u2019s mouth could go to work. I\u2019d rip out his throat then... When he aimed for me again with a furious glare, I was sure it was going to be the death blow, through my heart, but another roar, not thunder, stopped him. A beautiful Bengal tiger leaped in front of Achelous. It was enough of a surprise to make him pause.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Gloriana, is she here at your bidding or Circe\u2019s?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat does it matter, Achelous?\u201d Circe smiled as she held a weeping Ariane against her. \u201cGive up and let the sisters go. You have such a low opinion of them, why don\u2019t you pick up whores somewhere else to satisfy your appetites?\u201d The sisters flanked her now and there were angry mutters. Apparently the \u201cwhore\u201d comment wasn\u2019t sitting well. Of course Achelous had insulted them first and he got his share of angry glares. Circe silenced them with a gesture. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re being wronged, let\u2019s go to Olympus right now and take this up with Zeus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast.\u201d Achelous watched Laurie pace protectively in front of me. \u201cThe tiger wants to make a fight of it. I\u2019d like to test her powers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave her alone, Achelous.\u201d I looked down, shocked to realize the lightning bolts had vanished and he\u2019d released me. I was still bleeding and felt weak as the tiger slipped close enough to bump against me. I reached for her and pressed my hand on her back, taking strength from her warm fur as I staggered to my feet.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I? She seems to be the only one here with enough power to make this night interesting.\u201d Achelous laughed with his head thrown back, his white teeth gleaming. \u201cI took you down with one lightning bolt, didn\u2019t I? And my Sirens? Easily cowed, hiding behind Circe\u2019s skirts.\u201d He flicked a dismissive look at the women still close enough to the goddess to touch her toga. \u201cIf I decide I want them back, I will get them. Zeus and I will have a talk, man-to-man. He won\u2019t deny me.\u201d</p><p>I could see their terror. My sisters. Somewhere inside me I did remember and I found the courage to stand straighter.</p><p>\u201cYou want a fight? Come at me again. Burn me to a crisp but let the tiger and the sisters go. What kind of man lets women do his work for him anyway? If you want to kill, gather an army of men and go to war. That\u2019s how real men fight.\u201d Laurie\u2019s warm fur rippled beneath my fingers. A warning? Yes, I was talking tough. But I hated his macho act and I kept getting flashbacks of things he\u2019d forced me to do, degrading things that made me feel sick and filthy.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m not a real man?\u201d Achelous moved closer to us and the tiger growled low in her throat. I, for one, thought it was one of the scariest sounds I\u2019d ever heard. \u201cYou want some memories to remind you of how much of a man I was with you, Gloriana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving sex with unwilling women doesn\u2019t make you a man. It\u2019s called rape.\u201d That earned me gasps from the sisters. Oh, yeah, I was on a roll. I had no idea if I was being brave or stupid.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to rape women, they want me.\u201d He reached up to unpin the shoulder of his toga and let it drop to the ground. Of course he was built. Does the term Greek god ring a bell? But looks aren\u2019t everything. This guy was as hollow as a chocolate Easter bunny. Achelous didn\u2019t even register on my lust-o-meter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I turned to the gathered sisters who were practically gripping Circe\u2019s skirt, all except Aggie, who was still stuck behind Achelous like a piece of garden statuary. I\u2019d have to do something about that. \u201cShow of hands. Who really wants or likes to do it with Achelous?\u201d Hmm. Every one of the Sirens stared down at her designer shoes, her perfectly manicured hands clutched in front of her.</p><p>\u201cDamn them.\u201d Achy looked back at Aggie. \u201cWhat if I make them all hate water like I did you, Gloriana? How does that feel? I saw Aglaophonos dragging you across the lake. Sirens live to be in the sea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was mean, the kind of dirty trick only a man who needs to prove his power would do.\u201d I smiled. \u201cHaving power issues, Achy?\u201d I almost missed the tiny sign that I had hit a nerve.</p><p>\u201cYou must have a death wish, woman.\u201d Achelous gave me a long look and the wind picked up, blowing cold against my wet clothes. Laurie pressed against me with another growl.</p><p>\u201cYou thought to kill me once.\u201d I figured he would kill me now and waited for the end, calm and surprisingly accepting. This was probably for the best. Jerry would find a woman better for him\u2014please let it not be Mara. Ray would write songs and find a lover who would give him her whole heart. And Rafe. I gripped Laurie\u2019s fur. I hoped she would look after him. They would be good together.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you still live.\u201d Achelous released Aggie and she ran to join the rest of the sisters. \u201cTo hell with this tug-of-war. I\u2019ll give the women to you on one condition, Circe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems that I already have them. But I\u2019ll humor you. I\u2019d like to keep this out of Zeus\u2019s court if we could.\u201d Circe patted Aggie\u2019s shoulder as she slipped into place. \u201cWhat are your terms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a few moments alone with Gloriana.\u201d Achelous stared at me and I stared back. What fresh hell did he have in store for me? Laurie paced, obviously against the idea.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Circe didn\u2019t mince words and I could hear the sisters murmuring. I caught enough to realize they were all for throwing me to the wolf. Anything to get them away from the big bad.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care?\u201d Achelous picked up his toga and pinned it on again. \u201cShe is merely a vampire, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Circe nodded. \u201cThe tiger will leave as well.\u201d</p><p>That earned a growl but Laurie was obviously under orders. She disappeared along with the group of women and I was suddenly alone with Achelous. Merely a vampire. Guess that made me bottom of the food chain.</p><p>The rain had stopped and there was only a distant rumble of thunder and the drip of water from the surrounding trees to remind me of the storms his temper had unleashed. I looked down and saw that my wounds were almost healed. I thought about shifting out of there, but I doubted Achelous would let me get very far.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got me alone. Are you trying to decide how to kill me?\u201d I made it back to my boulder and sat, well and truly drained from what I\u2019d been through.</p><p>\u201cIf only I could.\u201d Achelous strode over to sit on the rock closest to mine as if ready to chat. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about taking off. I could easily find you now that I know you are still on this planet and not dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d I looked up at the night sky. My last night? Well then. \u201cWait a minute. You can\u2019t kill me? Why not? Seems like you did the next best thing, kicking me out of the harem like that. If it wasn\u2019t for Jerry, I\u2019d have been dead centuries ago.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, but not by my hand.

Hell, even vampires are the stuff of nightmares and fairy tales.\u201d</p><p>Achelous laughed. \u201cNightmares indeed. Gods, I couldn\u2019t believe it when you showed up with Aglaophonos after centuries. It was like a cruel joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was really funny how you left me in the mortal world with no memories or resources.\u201d I really hated the man\u2019s arrogance.</p><p>\u201cWithout resources?\u201d Before I could stop him, he grabbed my hand. His fingers were warm, almost hot. I guess from tossing around lightning bolts. Was he revving up for more torture? I snatched my hand back and saw sparks fly but he let me get away with it. I did try to read his mind but hit a stone wall.</p><p>\u201cIf I had any resources, I sure don\u2019t remember them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGloriana, I left you your Siren\u2019s beauty and body, though I couldn\u2019t resist adding a little extra in a few places.\u201d He laughed when I looked down at my hips. \u201cA god\u2019s got to have some fun. I planted memories for you of a mortal family too, religious zealots. How did you like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you could amuse yourself.\u201d Bastard. I sent this mental message but he just grinned.</p><p>\u201cBefore I\u2019d been away from you for more than a human fortnight you had a man taking care of you, in love with you.\u201d Achelous quit smiling. \u201cMortal fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband.\u201d I remembered the young actor who\u2019d taken me off the streets and adored me. But he\u2019d died so soon and of a freak accident. Or had it been an accident? My heart seemed to roll over in my chest and I felt sick. \u201cDid you kill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaturally. You were supposed to suffer, Gloriana.\u201d Achelous\u2019s eyes were cold as they swept over me.</p><p>How easily he spoke of taking an innocent man\u2019s life. I felt chilled and wanted to slap his face. I came to my senses but couldn\u2019t hold my tongue. \u201cAll this because I didn\u2019t have the stomach for the killing? Is that the acid test for you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course!\u201d He jumped up. \u201cAs soon as I was satisfied that you were alone and starving I really did leave you to your fate. I had no idea Circe took a hand in things after that and sent you a vampire to make you immortal.\u201d He looked down at me and shook his head. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my eyes when I saw you here, by this lake, still alive hundreds of years later. Meddling bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Circe got the better of you. She saved me and now she\u2019s taking your Sirens away from you. What you did to me proves you\u2019re not fit to have them, Achelous.\u201d I felt his power wash over me as he frowned down at me. The hairs on my arms stood on end and the wind began to howl. \u201cYou going to strike me down for telling it like it is?\u201d I braced myself.</p><p>\u201cI probably could kill you now and get away with it. The Siren part of you has been polluted by your years as a blood sucker. God, you even have fangs.\u201d He stepped back and raked me with a look that should have incinerated me. But he was holding back for some reason.</p><p>\u201cPolluted? Thanks a heap. Yes, I\u2019m vampire. I won\u2019t apologize for that. And you\u2019re a god who can manipulate people as you wish. What you did to me...\u201d I turned to look out over the lake. \u201cDo you know I can\u2019t bear to even stick my toe in that water without fear?\u201d I looked at him. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t sing a simple song and stay in tune.\u201d I sighed. \u201cYou already killed some of the best parts of me, Achelous.\u201d</p><p>Achelous threw out his hand and shot lightning at the nearest tree. It broke in two and burst into flames. He towered over me and for a minute I wondered if he was about to finish the job. I gritted my teeth, fangs down, thinking that I\u2019d sink them into his neck and make him bleed before I\u2019d stand here and just take it.</p><p>\u201cZeus\u2019s armpit, but you\u2019ve turned into a disgusting hag. I blame it on your living in the mortal world for so long. Remember this.\u201d Achelous rested his hands on my shoulders and I felt electricity sizzle through my body in an excruciating arc. Smoke actually came out of my toes and I could smell my hair burning. \u201cYou are a daughter of Olympus. That and only that has bought you your life tonight.\u201d</p><p>My teeth clicked together and it was a moment before I could speak. When I finally managed a breath, I tried to jerk away from him.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The sky was full of roiling clouds and I shivered in the chill wind.</p> <p>Achelous suddenly shoved me away, his own legs firmly planted in the sand. He was the picture of strong male and utterly merciless. \u201cI\u2019ve said enough. Get the hell out of here before I decide to take my chances and end you now, Gloriana.\u201d</p><p>I scrambled to put more distance between us. \u201cOkay then. And thanks. For kicking me to the curb.\u201d Before he could decide to fry me with another lightning bolt, I pulled together what little strength I had left and shifted into bird form. Then I flew out of there as fast as my wings could carry me.</p><p>I kept expecting to be shot out of the sky, well-done before I hit the ground. Instead, I actually made it across the lake and landed not far from Ray\u2019s house in the woods near the shore. I spotted my tiger friend prowling the grounds.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Laurie shifted and stood beside me while I got back to human form. It took me a while because I was at pretty low tide on the energy scale.</p><p>\u201cOkay? Um, let me check. In one piece. Yes. Still sizzling. Kind of. Achy did a number on me but he let me live. All in all it was pretty intense.\u201d I smiled at her. \u201cThanks for coming to the rescue.\u201d I felt my hair and came away with some pieces that were toasted. I was obviously going to need a trim before I traveled anywhere.</p><p>\u201cYou handled it pretty well on your own. And, I\u2019m sorry I abandoned you, but I was under orders I had to obey. I felt horrible leaving you there.\u201d She clapped me on the back so hard I staggered. \u201cLet me make it up to you. Ray says you\u2019re headed out of town. Need backup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m good. Did he send you? Across the lake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he never heard a thing. Too into his music. Circe called me. I left Will in charge of Ray and took off.\u201d Laurie shrugged. \u201cGuess you must have figured out that I\u2019m hers to command. I don\u2019t exactly advertise that fact so keep it to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. We all have secrets. Keep an eye on Ray while I\u2019m gone, will you?\u201d I sighed, the idea of flying back to my apartment absolutely exhausting.</p><p>\u201cGlad to. And if you want a ride tonight, I\u2019ve got a car parked a block away.\u201d She grinned. \u201cYes, I read your thoughts. Come on.\u201d</p><p>When we were in the car, Laurie glanced over at me. \u201cYou look terrible and you lost a lot of blood. I never saw anything like what Achelous did to you, Glory. Stabbed with lightning. Ouch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It wasn\u2019t exactly a walk in the park.\u201d I sighed and leaned back in the seat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re drained.\u201d She held out her wrist. \u201cHere. Help yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d I had to admit my fangs had been down since I\u2019d landed next to her. Hot shifter blood.</p><p>\u201cI can take it. Got to warn you, my stuff is high-octane.\u201d Laurie grinned. \u201cIt\u2019ll rev your engine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m not saying no.\u201d I picked up her wrist and took a whiff. Hello. \u201cPromise to pull me off if I get carried away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got it.\u201d Laurie didn\u2019t even blink when I sank my fangs into her vein.</p><p>Oh, sweet Heaven but she\u2019d been right. High-octane and I could feel the power flowing into me with each swallow. It was a matter of will to ease away from that fountain and lick the punctures closed. Were-tiger. And plugged into Olympus. Oh, yeah, there was something extra here.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I sighed with contentment as Laurie started her car and headed to Sixth Street.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. You really let Achelous have it tonight. Watching you two go at it, I admired your guts.\u201d She laughed. \u201cOr figured you were suicidal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just really, really steamed. I kept having these flashbacks, seeing the things I\u2019d had to do with him, for him, horrible things.\u201d I shuddered. \u201cNo woman should have to live like that. The Sirens were abused for too long.\u201d</p><p>Laurie nodded. \u201cCirce says there\u2019s a Siren treasure. You did work for Achelous for a thousand years and change. Seems like that should have earned you a little compensation. Not promising anything, those gods and goddesses do like their gold, but you might have something coming to you later. The wheels of justice will turn slowly and Zeus will have to pry it out of Achy\u2019s hands, you know. But Circe says she\u2019s going to try to get you a little severance pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding? Thank her for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe owes you, Glory. You don\u2019t think she took the Sirens on because of girl power, do you?\u201d Laurie smiled wryly. \u201cIt was all about the gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. So Achelous...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be after some of it as reparation. The Olympus CPAs will be very busy over this whole deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d I sighed. \u201cWell, if a little of it comes my way, I\u2019ll be thrilled but obviously I won\u2019t hold my breath. Thanks for letting me know. And thanks for the backup.\u201d I hugged Laurie when she let me out at the apartment building. When I got upstairs I had a visitor waiting.</p><p>Aggie sat on the top step. \u201cGirlfriend, that was some tough talk you pulled out of your ass tonight.\u201d She jumped up and threw her arms around me. \u201cThe sisters sent me to tell you we\u2019re in your debt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, glad I could help. I had some things to get off my chest anyway.\u201d I unlocked the apartment door. \u201cCome in. You think Circe will be okay as a fearless leader?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. Remains to be seen. I\u2019m not putting a whole lot of trust in anyone who hangs their hat in Olympus, you know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019?\u201d Aggie shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019re all more than a little freaked-out now that we know we can lose our song and the sea, like you did. As a punishment, it\u2019s a living death, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the only thing Achy did right, wiping my memory. I can\u2019t mourn what I didn\u2019t realize I had.\u201d I settled on the couch, still jazzed from Laurie\u2019s donation but itching with the need for a shower.</p> <p>\u201cYou going to share what the private convo with Achy was about? We\u2019re dying to know.\u201d Aggie made herself comfortable in the chair across from me.</p><p>\u201cNo big deal. He just wanted a couple of last words. Like he said. He popped me a few times with lightning too. Just to make sure I knew who was a god and who was a lowly vampire.\u201d I wasn\u2019t about to get into this with Aggie. Not tonight. A daughter of Olympus. Did that mean I had a mother somewhere? A goddess? The very idea made my head hurt.</p><p>\u201cWell, you look like the last words were \u2018Die, bitch.\u2019\u201d Aggie got up and patted my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to shower and do whatever vampires do to recover. Jump a mortal in an alley or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have synthetic blood if I need it.\u201d I walked her to the door. \u201cI\u2019m heading to Scotland soon. Going to tell Jerry he\u2019s not my victim and see what happens. Wish me luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Go get your man.\u201d Aggie grinned. \u201cMe? There\u2019s lots of fish in the sea. Speaking of... If you ever want to get over that water phobia, look me up. I\u2019ll start you off in the shallow end of a pool. Sorry about that rough trip across the lake before. I was a little, um, nervous about the confab with Achelous and Circe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI get it. But I won\u2019t forget it.\u201d I was wet and felt like I had lake creatures in my bra as I said good-bye to Aggie. One thing I did pull out was Ian\u2019s note to Jerry. I tossed it on my dresser. Maybe it was for the best if it arrived illegible. I didn\u2019t really trust Ian to pass a love note to the Campbells.</p><p>I was getting undressed and examining my various wounds when I heard the familiar chime that meant I had a text. Alesa giving me an update:</p><p>Beelzebub and LuLu born 12pm Sat. C.U. Mama A.</p><p>Two more demons in hell. I wondered how they celebrated. Had Alesa enjoyed a baby shower? Was there a maternity ward in hell\u2019s hospital? I knew I couldn\u2019t worry about the two little ones and that \u201cC.U.,\u201d which must mean \u201cSee you.\u201d Waste of energy. Demons were unpredictable and uncontrollable.</p><p>I jumped into the shower. If tonight had done nothing else, it had taught me that I was tougher than I\u2019d ever imagined. Hey, I\u2019d taken on the Storm God and survived, by damn. If I could do that, I could certainly handle a little trip by myself to a foreign country. Because I was going. On my own with no help from anyone. Of course, what I\u2019d find when I got there was anyone\u2019s guess.</p><p>Maybe it was the were-tiger blood I\u2019d downed that made me feel pumped and ready to take on anything. Or maybe it was the idea that I was a daughter of Olympus, whatever the hell that meant. But Glory St. Clair was on her way to Scotland. The guys in kilts had better watch out.</p>  </body></html>"]
