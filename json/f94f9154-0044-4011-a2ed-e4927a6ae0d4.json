For the majority of Psy, it is their lifeline, as vital as air.</p><p>To disconnect from the Net is to die.</p><p>But as autumn whispers on the horizon in the year 2081, it is the Net itself that is dying. Stagnant rivers of rot snake ever deeper into the center, and it is a rot that twists and corrodes, damaging sense and reason to leave only unthinking menace behind.</p> <p>If the Psy do not find a solution to this cancerous growth, the rot could soon begin to seep into the minds of those uplinked to the Net.</p><p>Or perhaps ... it already has.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>RIAZ CAUGHT A flash of midnight hair and a long-legged stride and called out, \u201cIndigo!\u201d However, he realized his mistake the instant he turned the corner. \u201cAdria.\u201d</p><p>Eyes of deepest blue-violet met his, the frost in them threatening to give him hypothermia. \u201cIndigo\u2019s in her office.\u201d The words were helpful, but the tone might as well have been a serrated blade.</p> <p>That did it. \u201cDid I kill your dog?\u201d</p><p>Frown lines marred her smooth forehead. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>God, that tone. \u201cIt\u2019s the only reason,\u201d he said, holding on to his temper by a very thin thread, \u201cI can think of to explain why you\u2019re so damn pissy with me.\u201d Adria had been pulled into den territory during the hostilities with Councilor Henry Scott and his Pure Psy army a month ago and had remained behind to take up a permanent position as a senior soldier. She\u2019d fought with focused determination by Riaz\u2019s side, followed his orders on the field without hesitation.</p><p>However, off the field?</p><p>Ice.</p><p>Absolute.</p> <p>Unrelenting.</p><p>Glacial enough to bite.</p><p>Folding his arms when she didn\u2019t reply, he stepped into her personal space, caught the subtle scent of crushed berries and frost. A strangely delicate scent for this hard-ass of a woman, he thought, before his wolf\u2019s anger overrode all else. \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d It came out a growl.</p><p>Eyes steely, she stepped closer with a slow deliberation that was pure, calculated provocation. She was a tall woman, but he was taller. That didn\u2019t seem to stop her from looking down her nose at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize,\u201d she said in a voice so polite it drew blood, \u201cthat fawning over you was part of the job requirement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I know who Indigo learned her mean face from.\u201d But where his fellow lieutenant\u2019s heart beat warm and generous beneath that tough exterior, he wasn\u2019t sure Adria had any emotions that registered above zero on the thermometer.</p><p>Adria\u2019s response was scalpel sharp. \u201cI don\u2019t know what she ever saw in you, but I suppose every woman has mistakes in her past.\u201d The slightest change in her expression, the tiniest fracture, before it was sealed up again, her face an impenetrable mask.</p><p>Scowling, Riaz was about to tell her exactly what he thought of her and her judgmental gaze when his cell phone rang. He answered without moving an inch away from the woman who was sandpaper across his temper, rubbing him raw with her mere presence. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy office,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cNeed you to head out, do a pickup.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe there in two.\u201d Snapping the phone shut, he closed the remaining distance between him and Adria, forcing her to tip back her head. \u201cWe will,\u201d he said, realizing those striking blue eyes with an edge of purple had streaks of gold running through them, beautiful and exotic, \u201ccontinue this later.\u201d</p><p>That was when Adria\u2019s cell phone rang. \u201cYes?\u201d she answered, without breaking eye contact with the big, muscled wolf who thought he could intimidate her.</p><p>\u201cIn my office,\u201d Hawke ordered.</p><p>\u201cOn my way.\u201d Hanging up, she raised an eyebrow at Riaz in a consciously insolent action. \u201cMy alpha has requested my presence, so get out of my fucking way,\u201d she said with utmost sweetness.</p><p>Eyes of beaten gold narrowed. \u201cGuess we\u2019ll be walking together.\u201d</p><p>Not giving an inch until he stepped back and turned to head to Hawke\u2019s office, she walked in silence beside him, though her wolf bared its teeth, hungry to draw blood, to bite and claw and mark. Damn him. Damn him. She\u2019d been doing fine, coping after her final separation from Martin. That had been a bloody battle, too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come crawling back to me. Maybe I\u2019ll be waiting. Maybe I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Adria stifled a raw laugh. Martin didn\u2019t understand that it was over. Done. It had been over the night a year ago when he\u2019d stormed out of their home, not to return for four months. The truly stunning thing was that he\u2019d had the gall to be shocked when she\u2019d told him to find someplace else to sleep and slammed the door in his face.</p><p>\u201cCat got your tongue?\u201d An acerbic comment made in a deep male voice that ruffled her fur the wrong way.</p><p>\u201cGo bite yourself,\u201d she muttered, in no mood to play games. Her skin felt too sensitive, as if she\u2019d lost a protective layer, her blood too hot.</p><p>\u201cSomeone should bite you,\u201d Riaz responded in a near snarl. \u201cPull that stick out of your ass at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Adria growled just as they reached the open door to Hawke\u2019s office. The alpha looked up at their entrance, open speculation in blue eyes so pale, they were those of a wolf given human form. However, when he spoke, his words were pragmatic. \u201cYou two free to go for a drive?\u201d</p><p>Adria nodded, saw Riaz do the same beside her. \u201cWhat do you need done?\u201d he asked, his tone far calmer than the one he\u2019d leveled at her.</p><p>\u201cMack and one of his trainee techs went up to do a routine service of the hydro station,\u201d Hawke told them, shoving back strands of hair the silver-gold of his pelt in wolf form, \u201cbut their vehicle\u2019s not starting, and they\u2019ve got components that need to be brought back to the den for repairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Riaz said. \u201cI\u2019ll take one of the SUVs, pick them up.\u201d</p><p>Even as Adria was thinking the task was a one-person job, Hawke turned to her. \u201cYou\u2019re now one of the most senior people in the den.\u201d His dominance was staggering, demanding her wolf\u2019s absolute attention. \u201cI\u2019d like you to get reacquainted with the region, given that you haven\u2019t spent an extended period of time here since you turned eighteen.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Riley and Eli to work some time into my shift schedule.\u201d It was a necessary detour from her normal duties\u2014falling just below the lieutenants in the hierarchy, senior soldiers were often called upon to lead, and as a leader she had to know every inch of this land, not only the section she\u2019d been assigned to during the battle. \u201cIt\u2019d be better if I do it on foot.\u201d She\u2019d see, scent, so much more.</p><p>\u201cYou can explore in detail later on. I want you to have a good working knowledge of the area as soon as possible.\u201d He handed her a thin plas map. \u201cThe trip up to the hydro station will take you through some critical sections\u2014and you have certification in auto mechanics, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It had been an interest she\u2019d turned into the secondary qualification all soldiers were required to possess. Later, it had kept her sane, the ability to fix broken things and make them whole again. \u201cI\u2019ll take a look at the vehicle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the replanting?\u201d Riaz asked, his voice clawing over her skin like nails on one of those old-fashioned chalkboards the pups liked to draw on. \u201cFelix\u2019s team have enough security?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fine.\u201d Walking to the territorial map on the stone wall of his office, Hawke tapped the large crosshatched section where the battle with Pure Psy had taken place. \u201cFelix\u2019s volunteers and conscripts\u201d\u2014a sharp grin\u2014\u201care planting the area with fast-growing natives, but for now, it\u2019s so open it\u2019s easy to monitor, especially with the cats sharing the watch.\u201d</p><p>Adria thought of what she\u2019d seen on that battlefield filled with the screams of wounded SnowDancers; the cold red and hypnotic gold of a flame so hypnotic and deadly, and wondered at the cost paid by the young Psy woman who held all that power\u2014and their alpha\u2019s heart. \u201cWhat are the chances of another serious Pure Psy attack?\u201d she asked, intrigued on the innermost level by a relationship that appeared so very unbalanced on the outside, and yet one that her wolf sensed was as solid as the stone of the den.</p><p>It was Riaz who answered. \u201cAccording to Judd\u2019s sources, close to nil. They\u2019ve got worse problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCivil war,\u201d Hawke said, shaking his head. \u201cIf he\u2019s right, all hell is going to break loose\u2014so we make sure we\u2019re prepared to weather any storms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe irritation hits?\u201d Riaz asked, and Adria knew he was referring to the sporadic attempts to lay booby traps in den territory.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Hawke agreed with a scowl. \u201cScent trails point to the perpetrators being a number of the Pure Psy survivors who just can\u2019t let it go. They\u2019re disorganized and their traps are laughable. Still, I have all the sentries taking care not to accidentally fall into a hole. A hole for crissakes!\u201d</p><p>Adria\u2019s wolf nodded in disgusted agreement. It really was time to retreat when you had to resort to digging holes and covering them up with leaves in the hope that SnowDancer\u2019s people wouldn\u2019t sniff them out a mile away. \u201cThey\u2019ll get tired sooner or later, but it might be an idea to make finding these traps a bit of a joke contest between the sentries.\u201d</p><p>Riaz angled his head toward her in a very wolfish way, even as Hawke\u2019s frustrated expression turned to one of interest.</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen,\u201d she said, keeping her eyes resolutely away from the man to her right, \u201cthe amount of time they have to waste neutralizing the traps is starting to frustrate the soldiers who patrol the borders, and it\u2019s the kind of thing that can grow into anger. That\u2019s not good for our people, especially coming off the stress of the battle. But if you make it so the sentry with the most sightings gets a prize at the end of each week\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201c\u2014it becomes a game,\u201d Riaz completed with a thoughtful nod. \u201cThat\u2019s very good.\u201d</p><p>Hands behind her back, Adria squeezed the wrist of one hand with the other to keep from snapping back that she didn\u2019t need his endorsement. The response was so far from her usual even-tempered nature that she bit down on the inside of her lip to snap herself out of it, her gaze focused straight ahead. Except the stranger who\u2019d taken over her body couldn\u2019t simply shut up. \u201cThank you.\u201d Honey sweet. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you approve.\u201d</p><p>A growl tangled up the air currents.</p> <p>\u201cWolves do like a game,\u201d Hawke said, his face suspiciously bland. \u201cI think Drew\u2019s the best person to organize it\u2014I\u2019ll get that in motion.\u201d He glanced at the time projected on the wall. \u201cYou two better head out so you can get back before dinner.\u201d</p><p>Walking out of the office with the man whose very scent\u2014dark, of the forest, with an edgy undertone of citrus and a brush of woodsmoke\u2014made her skin itch, she said, \u201cWe should get some food.\u201d The drive wouldn\u2019t be quick, plus Mack and his tech hadn\u2019t planned to be up there this long and would be hungry.</p><p>\u201cShould be something in here,\u201d Riaz said, entering the senior soldiers\u2019 break room.</p><p>They worked with honed efficiency to slap together some sandwiches, and were ready to go ten minutes later. Clenching her abdominal muscles as she got into the vehicle with Riaz, Adria told herself to concentrate on the route, the geography, anything but the potent masculine scent of the man in the driver\u2019s seat ... because she knew full well why he incited such violence in her.</p><p>RIAZ drove them out of the garage and into the mountains, very aware of the arctic silence from the passenger seat. The more time he spent with Adria, the more he realized how unlike Indigo she was, in spite of the superficial similarity of their looks. One of the reasons he\u2019d always enjoyed the other woman\u2019s company was her up-front nature\u2014Adria, by comparison, was a closed box, with Do Not Enter signs pasted on every surface.</p> <p>He understood that. Hell, he had his own \u201cno go\u201d zones, but with Adria, it was armor of broken glass that drew blood. \u201cThis track,\u201d he said, doing his job because, personality clash or not, he knew his responsibilities, \u201cis the most direct route to the hydro station.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot according to the map Hawke gave me.\u201d A quick, penetrating glance. \u201cSo what\u2019s wrong with the other road?\u201d</p><p>Reining in his wolf when it bared its teeth at what it read as a challenge, though the rational part of him knew he was just revved up for a fight after her earlier provocation, he said, \u201cSheer cliff face right in the middle.\u201d As a lieutenant who\u2019d had her under his command on the field, he appreciated her intelligence and determination to learn\u2014regardless of how often she used that sharp mind to slice into him with verbal claws.</p><p>Making two tight turns, he continued onward through the mountains that seemed to touch the sky. \u201cMeant to delay any aggressors if they ever get that far.\u201d</p><p>Adria didn\u2019t say anything for several long minutes, studying the map and their passage into the mountains. \u201cI\u2019ll need to request another senior soldier go with me on some of my exploratory trips\u201d\u2014her naturally husky voice low in thought\u2014\u201cso I don\u2019t miss things like that. I didn\u2019t have reason to memorize or even know all this as a teenager, and I\u2019m sure security details have been changed in the meantime anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you,\u201d Riaz said, because damn it, he was a lieutenant, even when it came to a prickly piece of cactus like Adria. \u201cIndigo made sure I was familiar with the details after I came back from my posting in Europe.\u201d He\u2019d been away long enough for many of the subtle security precautions to have been altered. \u201cIt\u2019ll be good for me to review the knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>Adria blinked, fingertips tightening on the sides of the plas map. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d It was the only thing she could say without giving everything away.</p><p>Riaz snorted, his hands strong and competent on the manual steering wheel as he navigated a particularly steep embankment, his bronzed arms dusted with a sprinkling of fine black hair. \u201cAbout as much as you appreciate a root canal,\u201d he said, thrusting the vehicle into hover drive, \u201cbut whatever your problem with me, we have to work together.\u201d</p><p>Setting her jaw, she focused on the view beyond the window\u2014of the most magnificent scenery on this earth. Summer had faded, fall a crisp promise in the air, but here the land was swathed in dark green, the peaks in the distance touched with white. She\u2019d grown up on this land, and even now, after she\u2019d been away for so long, it sang to her wolf, as it did to every SnowDancer. Den territory had a way of being home to all of them, no matter if they\u2019d given the name to another place.</p><p>I can heal here.</p><p>It was a thought deep in her heart, one that almost managed to unknot the tension wi\u2014\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d She jerked forward as a big tan-colored wolf raced across a verdant meadow to their left, chasing a sleek silver wolf she immediately recognized. \u201cHe\u2019s being rough with Evie.\u201d Fury boiled in her blood. \u201cStop the car.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s chuckle held pure male amusement, fuel to her temper. \u201cThat\u2019s Tai, and Evie won\u2019t appreciate the interruption, Aunt Adria.\u201d</p><p>Biting back her harsh response, Adria glanced at the two wolves again, saw what she\u2019d missed at first glance. They were playing, all teeth and claws, but with no real aggression to it. Just as Riaz turned a corner, cutting off the view, the two wolves nuzzled one another and Adria realized Tai and Evie weren\u2019t playing, they were courting.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too young.\u201d While Indigo was very close to Adria in age, Tarah had borne Evie later in life. The little girl had toddled around after her older sister and Adria when they\u2019d been in their teens, sweet natured and stubborn and beloved. Adria couldn\u2019t imagine her submissive niece was in any way ready to handle a dominant\u2014and having met Tai, she knew he was a hell of a lot stronger and more dangerous than Evie.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s still a wolf,\u201d Riaz said, his deep voice a rumble that vibrated uncomfortably against her achingly tight nipples, \u201can adult female wolf. You might have forgotten, Ms. Frost, but touch is necessary for most of our kind.\u201d</p><p>Her hand fisted, that nerve far too close to the surface.</p><p>A year.</p><p>It had been a year since she\u2019d shared intimate skin privileges, a rawly painful kind of isolation for a predatory changeling in the prime of her life. Even before then, things had been fragmenting for a long time, her wolf starved of affection. But she\u2019d been handling it, handling the broken pieces inside of her, until Riaz and the raging storm of a sudden, visceral sexual attraction that gripped her in its claws and shook, until she could barely think.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re throwing stones,\u201d she said, protecting herself by going on the offensive, \u201cI\u2019m not the only one who prefers a cold bed.\u201d Riaz was a highly eligible male\u2014the fact he\u2019d taken no lovers was a point of irritation with the SnowDancer women who wanted nothing better than to tussle with him. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why you\u2019re such a prick.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s snarl was low, rolling over her skin with the power of his dominance. Wrenching the wheel, he brought the SUV to a stop on the side of the road. \u201cI\u2019ve had it.\u201d He pinned her with his gaze. \u201cWhat the hell is your problem with me?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>\u201cDRIVE,\u201d SHE SAID, almost ready to crawl out of her skin with the need to rip off his T-shirt and use her teeth on all that hot, firm muscle. \u201cMack is waiting for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can wait a few more minutes.\u201d Eyes that were no longer in any way human slammed into hers. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a hard-on for me since you transferred to the den. I want to know why.\u201d</p><p>Gut twisting, she snapped off her safety belt and pushed open her door to step out into the cold mountain air, summer a distant memory this far up. The chill did nothing to cool the fever in her blood, the need ravaging her body, a need that threatened to make her a slave when she\u2019d finally found freedom.</p><p>Desperate, she focused on the majesty of her surroundings in an effort to fight the tumult within, her wolf clawing at the inside of her skin in violent repudiation of her choice to back off. In front of her lay tumbled glacial rocks, huge and imposing, beyond them the rich, deep green of the firs that dominated this area. Above it all was a sky so blue it hurt.</p><p>Home.</p><p>The slam of a door, followed by the thud of boots on the earth shattered her fragile attempt at control, and then Riaz was standing in front of her. Suddenly her view was hard muscle and implacable strength, the wild, dark scent of him in her every inhalation.</p><p>\u201cWe are not leaving,\u201d he said, his skin caressed by the sunlight that gilded his hair a gleaming blue-black, \u201cuntil we work this out.\u201d</p><p>Feeling trapped, suffocated, she shoved at his chest and slipped out to stand beside the car rather than with her back to it. \u201cDon\u2019t you put all the blame on me.\u201d Fighting back was instinct, her internal composure shattered. \u201cYou\u2019ve been picking at me since the day I was pulled into the den.\u201d</p><p>He growled, and the rough sound rasped over her skin, wrapped around her throat. \u201cSelf-fucking-defense. You took one look at me and decided you hated my guts. I want to know why.\u201d</p><p>Jesus, Adria thought, how had she gotten herself into this? She wasn\u2019t this woman who couldn\u2019t control her words, her thoughts. She was calm, stable, sensible, had been the levelheaded pivot for her friends when they\u2019d all been hormone-fueled teenagers. She was the one who\u2019d talked them down from the adrenaline-induced ledge she was now riding.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said, making the conscious decision to wrench herself back before her frustrated wolf took control and she found herself feasting on male lips currently thin with anger, \u201cit\u2019s nothing personal. I\u2019m generally a bitch.\u201d According to Martin, she was one with a stone heart.</p><p>Riaz snorted. \u201cNice try, but I\u2019ve seen you with others in the pack.\u201d He took another step toward her, invading her space and her senses, the scent of the forest serrated with a sharper edge that was pure furious wolf. \u201cI\u2019ve even seen you smile. How about you crack open one for me?\u201d Eyes of dark gold drilled into hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hell if she was going to allow him to walk all over her. \u201cGet out of my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want me to?\u201d he asked, a dangerous angle to his jaw. \u201cMaybe the reason you react like a hissing cat around me is because you want me even closer.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath.</p> <p>Riaz\u2019s eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d It was a wondering statement.</p><p>A fraction of an instant later, strong, rough-skinned hands cupped her face, a voracious mouth slamming down on her own, the potent scent of aroused male and the exotic, luscious taste of citrus and bitter chocolate flooding her senses.</p><p>Adria froze for a second before her touch-starved body took over, her wolf clawing to the surface. Grabbing at his shoulders, she devoured that sensual, demanding mouth, tangling her tongue with his, licking and sucking. When he hitched her up with a single powerful move, she wrapped her legs around his waist and let him slam her against the door of the rugged all-terrain vehicle. He tasted as sexy and dangerous and infuriating as he looked, one big hand thrusting into her hair, the other gripping her hip.</p><p>Parts of her body that had been in cold storage for a lot longer than a year sparked to wakefulness, hungry and wild and more than a little feral. Riaz growled when she drew blood with her claws on his nape, only to deepen the kiss, shoving the hand on her hip under her shirt to close over her breast and squeeze.</p> <p>The shock of the proprietary hold almost snapped her out of the madness, but then he pushed up her bra and the rough warmth of his palm on her bare flesh was a jolt to the system that splintered rational thought. Unable to get enough of his mouth, she sucked on his tongue, his lips, before kissing her way down the stubble of his jaw to grip at the tendons of his neck with her teeth.</p><p>Growling deep in his chest, he pulled her head back to take her mouth again. He wasn\u2019t the least bit gentle, but she didn\u2019t want gentle, her claws digging into his shoulders as her body moved with raw impatience against him. Taking his hand off her breast, he tore the button off her jeans, tugged down the zipper. It was as she broke the kiss to gasp in a breath that he shoved his hand into her panties and through the damp curls between her thighs\u2014to spear two blunt-tipped fingers into her in a hard thrust that made her scream and break apart in a powerful clenching of muscles.</p><p>The orgasm was a naked blade, one that cut her in half with the primal viciousness of it and left her bereft at the same time. Opening her eyes when he withdrew his fingers, she saw a glittering expression she understood all too well. Fury. At her. At himself. \u201cPut me down,\u201d she said, shaken to the core by the violent depth of her response.</p><p>Never, never had she orgasmed that hard ... and felt so lost, a block of ice in her gut.</p><p>Not saying a word, he did so, putting his hands on her waist to help stabilize her when her legs wobbled. \u201cGet your hands off me.\u201d She\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d touch her with that look in his eyes, his anger a brutal heat that slapped her with every breath.</p><p>LETTING go of the stiff woman in his arms, Riaz turned on his heel. \u201cFuck.\u201d What the hell had just happened? He didn\u2019t even like Adria, and yet he\u2019d betrayed his mate with her, would\u2019ve had his cock balls-deep in her by now if she hadn\u2019t stopped things. That cock pulsed, so rigid it was painful. No.</p> <p>\u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>He turned in time to catch a bottle of water.</p><p>\u201cWash your fingers,\u201d she said, red streaking the defined arch of her cheekbones. He knew the color had nothing to do with embarrassment, even before she bit out, \u201cI don\u2019t particularly want to advertise my lapse in judgment,\u201d through gritted teeth.</p><p>A second later, she was inside the car, a sculpture in ice, no hint remaining of the demanding female wolf who\u2019d been wet and hot and tight around his fingers not two minutes ago.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>COUNCILOR KALEB KRYCHEK examined the consciousness of the individual he\u2019d first been alerted to by the NetMind, the neosentience that was the librarian and guardian of the Net. The consciousness in front of him was moderately powerful\u2014that of a Gradient 5.7 telepath employed by a major corporation. The male\u2019s Silence was flawed, minor fractures visible to the careful eye. But that was an ordinary enough situation, and not what interested Kaleb.</p><p>This male had the bad luck to be uniquely susceptible to the unnamed and largely unnoticed disease that was carving silent, deadly runnels through the PsyNet. Others had been infected earlier, and were all now dead or insane. The mass outbreak at Sunshine Station had claimed one hundred and forty-one victims, eleven of whom had originally been put into involuntary comas in the belief they could be saved.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>Subject 8-91, however, continued to function in spite of his advanced infection, leaving Kaleb to conclude that something had altered in the sickness within the Net, making it able to survive longer within its host. Contracted via direct contact with one of the \u201cdiseased\u201d sections of the Net\u2014though Kaleb was apparently immune to the effect, likely as a result of his connection to the twisted twin of the NetMind\u2014the infection didn\u2019t yet spread from person to person, but there was a high chance it would mutate further, becoming even more noxious.</p><p>Subject 8-91 was the first host the NetMind had found of the new variant, and as such, he\u2019d become Kaleb\u2019s barometer, his \u201ccanary in a coal mine.\u201d The old saying was apropos. If 8-91 continued to react as he\u2019d done to date, he would show the catastrophic effects of the quietly spreading rot before anyone else in the Net.</p><p>No, Kaleb corrected himself, 8-91 is already showing the effects. The male had had a violent outburst in his sleep two days ago, so violent that he\u2019d broken several bones in his hand when he punched it into a wall. What made the violence interesting was that it had no connection to the male\u2019s Silence\u2014though he didn\u2019t know that. It had been initiated by the changes the infection had caused in his brain.</p><p>Subject 8-91 had been smart enough to create a cover story before he went to see one of the M-Psy about his hand, but the NetMind watched him constantly, knew his every move. And since the NetMind and its twin, the DarkMind, both spoke to Kaleb, he was never unaware of the status of the subject.</p><p>Continue to watch, he told the NetMind, his order given less in words than via an intuitive psychic connection he could explain to no one, not even another Psy. Protect him from exposure. Kaleb needed 8-91 to remain an active part of the Net. Any interference would shadow the picture, dull the clear view of the progress of the male\u2019s impairment and Kaleb\u2019s understanding of it.</p><p>A stream of consciousness from the NetMind, a question.</p><p>No, Kaleb said in response. You can\u2019t save him. He\u2019s too damaged. The rot had invaded 8-91\u2019s physical brain, was eating away at parts of his frontal lobe\u2014a change so subtle the M-Psy would likely have missed it, even if he had been a neural specialist as opposed to orthopedic. As the infected from Sunshine Station had proved, there was no cure, and this new variant was more complex than the one that had resulted in the outbreak. Even if there had been a cure, Kaleb would\u2019ve given the same answer\u20148-91\u2019s death was inevitable.</p><p>Someone had to be the canary.</p><p>Dismissing the man from his thoughts after taking note of the development of the infection, he returned to his physical body, stopping only long enough to ask the NetMind and DarkMind both a question. Do you know the location of this individual? He sent through an image, along with a psychic profile built from his memories and the data files he\u2019d hacked over the years.</p><p>The puzzlement was the same response he\u2019d received each and every time he\u2019d asked after his personal quarry ever since he\u2019d first made contact with the twin neosentience. It was as if his target no longer existed in the Net, but Kaleb knew differently. And nothing, not even the inexplicable failure of the NetMind and DarkMind to sense the truth, would stop him from hunting down that target.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>HAWKE SNAGGED SIENNA\u2019S hand as they passed in the corridor, dragging her into a corner hidden from the eyes of curious packmates. \u201cWhere are you going in such a rush?\u201d His wolf was delighted to see her, rolling around in the autumn and spice of her scent like a pup. It made him remember how he\u2019d awakened her this morning, how he\u2019d licked up that delectable scent in a much more intimate fashion.</p><p>Sienna\u2019s voice was low and caressing when she replied, the fingers of her free hand spread over his heart. \u201cI\u2019m meeting some of the leopards for lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKit?\u201d A feral growl.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her scowl matched the straight line of her mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p><p>The boy had also kissed her, dared to put his hands and his scent on her. \u201cNo.\u201d It was an order from the wolf, a wolf used to obedience.</p><p>But Sienna Lauren Snow had never once bowed down to him. Tugging her hand from his hold, she rose on tiptoe to thrust both into his hair. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His stare was met by her own, his dominance countered by the steely will of a cardinal X. \u201cI think it\u2019s time I bit you again,\u201d he muttered, rubbing his finger over the curve where her neck met her shoulder, his favorite spot to mark her.</p><p>The threat made Sienna pull playfully at his hair. \u201cYou did that this morning. It\u2019s my turn.\u201d A quick nip of his lower lip. \u201cDo you want to join us?\u201d</p><p>Hell, yes\u2014because while he might not be able to intimidate his smart, sexy, dangerous mate, he damn well could and would warn off the baby cat alpha she called friend. But\u2014\u201cI have to meet with the maternal females.\u201d Wincing at the reminder, he bent his head so she could pet him more effectively. \u201cThey\u2019re on the warpath about some of the juveniles.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Sienna ran her nails over his scalp, the caress making his wolf arch its neck in wild pleasure. \u201cYou sound scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny man not scared of a bunch of maternals ganging up on him needs his head examined.\u201d Hackles still raised by the thought of her lunch date, he straightened to his full height, his mate\u2019s hands sliding to his shoulders. \u201cIf that cub puts his hands anywhere near you, I don\u2019t care if he is your friend, I\u2019ll rip his arms off.\u201d He wasn\u2019t joking\u2014this soon after mating, the wolf was possessive beyond belief, the mating bond raw. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sienna\u2019s smile faded. \u201cYou know I would never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I know that,\u201d he snapped, annoyed that she\u2019d even contemplate he didn\u2019t trust her. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d</p><p>A raised eyebrow, tiny nails digging into his shoulders. \u201cWhat is the point then, Your Alphaness?\u201d</p> <p>He snapped his teeth at her for that smart-ass remark. \u201cThe point is you\u2019re mine. End of story. No touching by any other male.\u201d He paused, considered. \u201cSpecial family-affection dispensation for those related to you.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t respond, he leaned in close and whispered, \u201cI did warn you,\u201d his lips brushing her ear. He\u2019d told her exactly what it would mean to be his, how hard he\u2019d be to handle, how totally he\u2019d claim her. And still she\u2019d come to him, but he wondered if she was only now understanding the true depth of what he\u2019d demand from her. The thought that he might be distressing his mate by being who he was made both parts of him go motionless, watchful.</p><p>Shivering in response to his touch, she pushed him back until she could meet his gaze. Her glare was dark ... but then she laughed, the sound of it wild lightning along his fur. \u201cI guess,\u201d she said, the stars vibrant in her eyes, \u201cthat serves me right for mating with an alpha.\u201d</p><p>His wolf relaxed. His mate had no fear in her scent, in her teasing smile, the bond between them vivid with the red and amber fire that was her brand. Running his hands down the sleek curve of her back, he nuzzled at her. \u201cI may get a little more ... flexible after we\u2019ve been mated for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you won\u2019t.\u201d Sienna pressed a hot, wet kiss to his jaw, her fingers stroking the heat of his nape. \u201cBut I love you exactly as you are\u2014and I know how to stand my ground. So do your worst, beautiful man.\u201d</p> <p>He was alternately proud of her strength and aggravated by her intransigence. A familiar occurrence when it came to this woman. Sienna might be younger and physically smaller, but she\u2019d go toe-to-toe with him without a blink. The thought made him grin, every part of him aware they\u2019d likely be butting heads for the next century. He couldn\u2019t wait.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said, tracing his smile with a fingertip, \u201cwhat are the maternals mad about?\u201d</p><p>He was used to talking to his lieutenants and senior packmates about pack business, but it felt utterly different talking with Sienna about the same thing. Because she was someone of his own, someone who listened not because it was SnowDancer business, but simply because she liked being with him, liked knowing things that mattered to him.</p><p>\u201cThe word \u2018hormones\u2019 was used,\u201d he told her, already feeling the dull pulse of a throbbing headache. \u201cSome of the older juveniles are apparently getting too frisky. I\u2019ll probably end up dragging the boys off to remind them to keep their paws to themselves.\u201d Groaning, he bent so his forehead touched hers. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll have to do the same thing with the girls.\u201d Normally, Indigo and Riley would take care of the situation, but sometimes only an alpha\u2019s voice would get the message across.</p><p>\u201cBut skin privileges are an accepted part of pack life.\u201d Sienna\u2019s breath kissed his lips. \u201cI know my friends had relationships when they were younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are still boundaries,\u201d Hawke said, restraining the urge to undo her braid, to knot his hands in that pretty ruby red hair. \u201cSometimes the wolf has to be reminded that it needs to wait for the human half to catch up.\u201d</p> <p>Sienna\u2019s gaze turned thoughtful. \u201cYes, I understand. That\u2019s why you let your wolf be in charge when you were younger\u2014you said it was more mature.\u201d</p><p>He played the end of her braid over his fingertips. \u201cControlling the wolf is something we learn as children and have to maintain as we grow older. Without that control, there\u2019d be a lot more rogues.\u201d Changeling wolves who gave in to their animals turned into vicious killers\u2014and they most often targeted those who had been their own.</p><p>\u201cDo you think the juveniles are responding to the stress of being evacuated out of the den?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but if it\u2019s unsettled them to that degree, we\u2019ll have to organize supervision and retraining for a whole lot of young ones.\u201d</p><p>Sienna stroked his nape. \u201cI know it\u2019s a headache for you, but what I feel for you only grows deeper every time I see how you care for each member of the pack, young and old, strong and weak.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never needed verbal petting\u2014but when Sienna said things like that, yeah, it mattered. Raising his head, he released her braid and ran his knuckles down her cheek. \u201cGo, have your lunch.\u201d It cost him to say that, to know that he was sending her out with a man who had once shown an interest in her. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving den territory?\u201d It was too dangerous to chance yet.</p><p>The Council now knew she was alive. Ming LeBon, the man who had attempted to turn her into a weapon when she\u2019d been barely more than a child, knew she was alive. And Sienna\u2019s abilities were of unrivaled potential\u2014no one understood or could predict how her power would develop as she grew older ... because there had never been another cardinal X-Psy who\u2019d survived to adulthood.</p><p>His gut twisted at the thought of Sienna broken and dead at the hands of the enemy, and he had to clench his fists to keep from grabbing her and stashing her in their quarters, where she\u2019d be safe. He fought the urge because the one thing he would never, ever do to Sienna, was cage her. She\u2019d already spent far too much of her life behind bars, the psychic prison designed to contain her power turning into a place of mental torture.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she assured him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t risk that when things are so unstable. Kit and the others are going to meet us in the White Zone, and we\u2019ll go down to the waterfall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiordan, Evie, and Lake are also coming.\u201d</p><p>His wolf settled. The boys would make sure no one attempted to poach on his territory\u2014and he\u2019d just keep that thought to himself, he decided with a somewhat feral internal grin. \u201cYou want to have dinner with the kids?\u201d he asked, knowing they had only a couple more minutes.</p><p>That smile again, the one she hadn\u2019t given him before, when they\u2019d been circling each other ... and that she gave him every day now. It was a kick to his heart every single time. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind how much time we\u2019re spending with them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d Toby was her brother, Marlee her cousin. They were Pack, pups to love and protect. \u201cSince Walker\u2019s stopped giving me the death stare, it\u2019s actually become comfortable.\u201d The eldest Lauren was very protective of those under his care, considered Sienna his daughter. Hawke had no doubt the other man would quietly, methodically gut him at the smallest sign that he was causing Sienna distress. His wolf approved.</p><p>Laughter wrapping him in silken ropes, the crimson fire of his mate\u2019s touch flickering through his blood. \u201cLara will protect you.\u201d Stealing another little kiss, she stepped away, paused, her next words vibrant with emotion. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He knew what it meant to her that she could say those words and know no one would hurt her for daring to feel, for daring to love with all the power of her strong, loyal heart. Closing the short distance between them, he answered with a kiss as tender as he knew how to give, his fingers closing possessively around her throat.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you have to go to that meeting?\u201d she whispered when he lifted his head, her lips wet and luscious, her body arching toward his own.</p><p>His wolf was tempted. Sorely. \u201cNell and her crew will hunt us down and interrupt.\u201d Maternal females were not to be messed with. \u201cThen they\u2019ll make us feel like shamed five-year-olds.\u201d He took another kiss, rubbing his thumb over the flutter of her pulse and reining in the urge to bite. Later, he promised his wolf. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tonight.\u201d</p><p>He watched after her until she disappeared around the corner, the possessiveness inside him a primal craving that made him want to haul her over his shoulder and drag her to his bed. Maybe tie her to it for good measure.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it,\u201d Riley said as he walked over to join Hawke for the Meeting of Doom.</p><p>Hawke met his senior lieutenant\u2019s brown eyes, always so calm and stable. \u201cThe only way you could know what I was thinking was if you\u2019d had similar thoughts yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMercy forgives me ... most of the time.\u201d A slow smile. \u201cCome on, enough procrastinating.\u201d</p><p>As they walked, Hawke said, \u201cAdria and Riaz. Problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPersonality clash, I think. They seem to work well enough together despite it.\u201d The lieutenant glanced at him. \u201cWhy? You want me to split their shifts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, better they work it out.\u201d He\u2019d picked up something more violent and intense than a simple personality clash, but his wolf knew when to be discreet, so he didn\u2019t mention it. Instead, he turned the conversation to the juveniles, and the remainder of their walk passed in shoptalk.</p><p>While meetings such as this one promised to be weren\u2019t ever on his favorite things-to-do list, it felt good to be doing something as normal as worrying about the juveniles. Not discussing Psy surveillance or planning to defend against an attack. Not stockpiling weapons, or checking medical supplies as they waited to evacuate their vulnerable. Not even meeting with the DarkRiver leopards to assess a suspected threat.</p><p>It had been months since his wolves had had a chance to just be Pack.</p><p>However, Hawke knew the fact SnowDancer and its allies had won the battle didn\u2019t mean their enemies wouldn\u2019t regroup and return. But he was a wolf. He also knew how to live in the moment\u2014a time in which he was mated to a woman who challenged, loved, and teased him; his pack was safe; and the den filled with the vibrant sounds of children\u2019s voices once more. \u201cHow\u2019s the planning going for the mating ceremony?\u201d Sienna was indelibly his, but his pack needed to have a chance to celebrate their alpha\u2019s mating, and they\u2019d get that chance four days from now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDrew suggested dancing girls.\u201d</p><p>Hawke grinned. \u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>Riley shot him an unamused look. \u201cDon\u2019t encourage him or I swear to God I will hire a troop of strippers, complete with spangled pasties, and watch cheerfully while Sienna barbecues you.\u201d</p> <p>Wondering what else Drew had been suggesting, Hawke stifled his laugh. \u201cSeriously, how\u2019s it going?\u201d Riley and Nell were sharing the overall organizational load, in charge of ensuring all the pieces came together into a cohesive whole.</p><p>\u201cGood. My brother, when he isn\u2019t e-mailing me brochures about Brazilian samba dancers and Vegas showgirls, has found a job for every single person who wants to be involved in the preparation.\u201d</p><p>That was why, Hawke thought, Drew was so perfect for the position he occupied. Not quite part of the hierarchy, he was Hawke\u2019s eyes and ears in the pack, accessible to even the weakest of their number, those who might feel intimidated approaching one of the other dominants. No one was intimidated by Drew, and that was an incredible achievement, given that the other man was SnowDancer\u2019s tracker, charged with finding and executing rogues if the need arose. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a good night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best,\u201d Riley said quietly, then took a deep breath. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Hawke folded his arms and stared at the door with a sour expression. \u201cI hate these meetings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe should make Drew attend instead. Teach him a lesson.\u201d</p><p>They both stared at each other and grinned. Yeah, he thought, pushing through the door, it was nice to be doing something as ordinary as grousing about a meeting with the maternals.</p><p>ALICE</p><p>FROM: Lara&lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p> <p>TO: Ashaya&lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;;</p><p>Sascha&lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;;</p><p>Tammy&lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p> <p>/* */ &gt;;</p><p>Amara&lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>DATE: Aug 26, 2081 at 11.00 a.m.</p><p>SUBJECT: Patient A</p><p>I thought you\u2019d all appreciate a quick update on Patient A.

One thing I know for certain: there is someone within her body. We just have to find a way to set her free.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>ADRIA DIDN\u2019T KNOW how she\u2019d survived the rest of the trip up to the hydro station; the silence in the SUV had been excruciating. The journey down, the mountains bathed in the gentle afternoon sunlight, was better\u2014she chose to ride in Mack\u2019s vehicle, having been able to fix the problem that had stalled it. Her excuse about needing to be with him in case the truck broke down again was accepted without question. Mack\u2019s trainee rode with Riaz, and Mack, with his silver-threaded curls and skin of warm brown marked by quiet laugh lines, was a man comfortable with silences.</p><p>Back in the den, she didn\u2019t stop until she was in her quarters with the door safely shut. Only then did she collapse on the bed. \u201cChrist, Adria.\u201d Shaking from the impact of a day that had spiraled out of control from the instant she\u2019d run into Riaz, she just sat there, trying to get a grip on her emotions.</p><p>The knock on the door was familiar, but she ignored it. Her visitor persisted, having obviously scented her presence, until she muttered, \u201cIt\u2019s open.\u201d</p><p>Indigo, dressed in jeans paired with a plain white tee that flattered the curves of her tall body, closed the door and leaned back on it. \u201cHurts me to say this, Ri, but you look worse than you did after you caught the plague when you were seventeen.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cplague\u201d had been a nasty case of food poisoning. \u201cThanks for the pick-me-up.\u201d She scowled at the woman who had been her friend most of her life. \u201cNow go away.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Indigo strode across the room to sit beside her instead. \u201cMartin\u2019s not been hassling you, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I made it clear we were done.\u201d He hadn\u2019t taken the news with any grace, all traces of the funny, gentle man she\u2019d fallen for corroded to nothingness by years of slow bitterness. But Martin wasn\u2019t the male on her mind right then. \u201cYou had a thing with Riaz, right?\u201d</p><p>Indigo blinked at the blunt question. \u201cYes, but years ago, well before he left for Europe. We were friends.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t such a strange thing to hear from a changeling. Sharing intimate skin privileges was an integral part of their nature, and there was nothing wrong with being with a friend who cared enough about you to ensure your pleasure. It didn\u2019t matter if the lovers knew their friendship would never lead to a relationship\u2014friendship was a precious thing to a wolf, to be cherished on its own merits.</p><p>Indigo nudged at her when she didn\u2019t continue, her namesake eyes perceptive. \u201cRiaz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Knowing no further explanation was needed, she shoved her hands through her hair, messing up her braid. \u201cIt\u2019s weird. You\u2019re my niece.\u201d</p><p>Indigo made a distinctly inelegant sound. \u201cPlease. We grew up as sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you cut that out?\u201d A sharp elbow to the ribs. \u201cEverything else aside, we happen to be two dominant women in one pack with a bare few years between us\u2014the only surprise is that we didn\u2019t cross paths with the same man before now.\u201d</p><p>In spite of the fact she was the one who\u2019d brought it up, Adria\u2019s wolf was sanguine about a past long gone. The human part of her, too, knew that Indigo and Riaz\u2019s old relationship had no bearing on the present situation, not given the time that had passed and their complete lack of interest in one another now. It would\u2019ve just made it easier to hide from the turbulence of her own emotions if it had been an issue.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, Indigo.\u201d No man had ever incited her to behave as she had today. \u201cI almost attacked him.\u201d She\u2019d wanted to rip his clothes off, shove him to the ground, taste every inch of his bronzed skin with her lips. \u201cI drew blood.\u201d The taste of iron, metallic and distinctive, had been hot, strong ... exhilarating.</p><p>Indigo\u2019s laugh was affectionate. \u201cThat\u2019s fairly normal when a female wolf is as on edge as you\u2019ve been.\u201d A playful waggle of her eyebrows. \u201cLong time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year,\u201d she said and knew exactly when Indigo understood the ramifications of her statement, because she seemed to stop breathing for a second.</p><p>\u201cSo, when you and Martin came to the dinner to meet Drew...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d ended it months earlier.\u201d The flash of hurt in Indigo\u2019s eyes had her nudging the other woman\u2019s shoulder in a silent apology. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to talk to anyone\u2014needed to get my head on straight.\u201d When Indigo squeezed her hand, she continued. \u201cI\u2019m not proud to admit it, but I used him when I \u2018gave in\u2019 to his persistent efforts to win me back and asked him to come along that night.\u201d</p><p>It hadn\u2019t taken Martin long to realize the invitation didn\u2019t equal one to her bed or to her life, and he\u2019d been in an ugly temper by the time they\u2019d arrived. Feeling guilty for having consciously misled the man who had once walked by her side, she\u2019d tried to reach out, pacify him.</p><p>His response had, for a single painful second, returned her to the ruins of their relationship, before it hardened her resolve. \u201cI thought you were making a horrible mistake.\u201d The realization that Indigo was seeing a man whose dominance didn\u2019t match Indigo\u2019s own, had chilled her blood.</p><p>\u201cAnd you wanted me confronted with the results.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d It had to be said, because Drew was nothing, nothing like Martin, his adoration of his \u201cIndy\u2019s\u201d strength open.</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Indigo\u2019s response was fierce. \u201cYou won\u2019t have any of those problems with Riaz. He\u2019s strong enough not to be scared of your hunger, and\u201d\u2014a smile that lit up her eyes\u2014\u201che\u2019s got enough wildness in him to lead you astray.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Most lone wolves did. As a young woman, Adria had always steered clear of them, aware that while such a male might make love to her with primal intensity, he was as likely to disappear into the mountains come morning. She\u2019d always known she needed someone more stable, more rooted. But things had changed. She had changed. \u201cYou\u2019re not saying something.\u201d Adria knew Indigo too well not to have caught the subtle hesitation.</p><p>The other woman took a long time to reply, her expression troubled. \u201cHe told me something in confidence, and I can\u2019t break that promise,\u201d she said at last. \u201cBut Adria, you need to know ... any relationship with him, even more than with another lone wolf, is unlikely to ever turn permanent.\u201d</p><p>The fact that Indigo hadn\u2019t flat out warned Adria off, told her it wasn\u2019t a case of Riaz already being involved with someone else. Which either meant he played the field\u2014and nothing she\u2019d heard indicated that\u2014or he wanted someone he couldn\u2019t have. Though Indigo couldn\u2019t know it, that realization eased the cold knot inside Adria, allowed her to breathe, come to a decision.</p> <p>\u201cI need to talk to him.\u201d Wolf and woman in agreement, she rose to her feet. \u201cWe left things in a bad place.\u201d No matter what happened, she didn\u2019t want this to affect their working relationship, and by extension, the pack.</p><p>Waiting until she\u2019d redone her braid, Indigo walked out with her. \u201cAre you enjoying being back in the den?\u201d she asked, reaching back to tighten her own ponytail.</p><p>\u201cSo much.\u201d Adria narrowed her eyes at Tai when the young soldier with uptilted green eyes and wide shoulders walked down the corridor.</p><p>\u201cGod hates me,\u201d she heard him mutter. \u201cNow there are two of them.\u201d</p><p>Neither she nor Indigo said anything until he was out of earshot. Then Indigo\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cPoor baby.\u201d Affection laced the words.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s solid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoves Evie.\u201d Wolfish amusement danced in her eyes. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t get to mess with him.\u201d</p><p>Since Evie was gentle and in no way dominant or aggressive, Adria agreed. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d she said, returning to their earlier topic of conversation, \u201cMatthias is a great lieutenant to work under.\u201d Darkly beautiful and with those eyes that had talked many a woman into bed, Matthias had been a friend as well as her lieutenant.</p><p>He\u2019d called to check up on her a couple of times since she\u2019d relocated to the den, and it was a measure of her trust in, and respect for him that she hadn\u2019t bristled. \u201cBut that region\u2019s got too many bad memories for me, you know? Den\u2019s a fresh start.\u201d One she\u2019d allow nothing, not even the hot burn of a shocking need, to steal from her.</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s my stop.\u201d Indigo halted in front of one of the break rooms. \u201cHaving an informal chat with some of my novices and newer soldiers.\u201d She raised an eyebrow at the young woman who was all but crawling down the hall. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiaz the Sadist\u2019s new configuration of the training run is an excuse for heinous and unparalleled torture,\u201d Sienna muttered before nodding hello at Adria and limping inside\u2014to a chorus of sympathetic groans from others who\u2019d obviously been subjected to the same torture.</p> <p>Indigo hung back, her eyes returning to Adria. \u201cRemember what I said.\u201d Open concern on her face ... tempered by a glint of wickedness. \u201cBut don\u2019t be too sensible. Claws and teeth are part of the fun.\u201d</p><p>Adria\u2019s grin faded as soon as Indigo walked in to join her soldiers. Martin had been the biggest chance she\u2019d ever taken in her life, overriding the concerns of those who didn\u2019t think the dominant female/less dominant male pairing had a hope of working. The spectacular failure of that risk had savaged her confidence, until sometimes she felt as if the core of her was a patchwork quilt, the stitches barely holding.</p><p>It would be easy, so easy, to stay \u201csafe,\u201d to never again stick out her neck, but Adria was a dominant, a SnowDancer. She was not a coward, and would never shame her wolf by allowing herself to become one. Even if that meant she had to go claw to claw against a lone wolf who was nothing she\u2019d ever wanted in a man\u2014and who compelled her beyond reason.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>JUDD LAUREN WAS still alive.</p><p>Ming looked down at the unexpected report. He\u2019d ordered the Arrows to eliminate Judd soon after the continued existence of the rogue Tk-Cell became known. It had been meant to be a first, debilitating strike before the much more important elimination of Sienna Lauren, the X a far bigger threat. Though the Arrows were no longer his, he hadn\u2019t expected Aden or his men to have a problem with taking care of the rebel Arrow.</p><p>Since the Tk-Cell had abandoned the squad when he defected, it was clear the Arrows had disregarded Ming\u2019s order not out of any loyalty to their former comrade, but to make it clear to Ming that they would no longer support him in any form. A critical loss, but not crippling. Looking up to meet the eyes of the man who\u2019d brought him the report, he said, \u201cDo we have anyone with the training to take on Lauren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Only an Arrow can successfully contain another Arrow.\u201d</p> <p>Ming had to agree. The Arrows were too highly trained to be easy prey. He\u2019d been one of their number in his youth, but he\u2019d been out of active service for two decades, no longer had the same level of skill when it came to covert assassinations. Added to the fact that Judd Lauren could teleport, it made no rational sense to go after the rebel Arrow himself.</p><p>However, Sienna Lauren was neither an Arrow nor a telekinetic. He\u2019d trained her, and so he knew her exact skill set. There were murmurs in the Net that she\u2019d further honed those skills during her time with the wolves, but that didn\u2019t alter his conclusions. If it came down to it, the battle would be a psychic one\u2014and he\u2019d trapped her with his mind once. He would do it again.</p><p>\u201cKeep monitoring the situation,\u201d he ordered. \u201cUnobtrusive surveillance. No contact.\u201d Sienna hadn\u2019t appeared in public since the lethal wave of her X-fire had consumed a significant percentage of Henry\u2019s Pure Psy army. No one was yet certain that she hadn\u2019t perished in the aftermath. If she had, it would\u2019ve been because she\u2019d been physically executed by one of her own\u2014because unless his power release theory had borne out, the psychic implosion of a cardinal X would\u2019ve taken out the Sierras themselves. \u201cYour goal is to discover if Sienna Lauren survived the battle.\u201d</p><p>If she was alive, she could not be allowed to exist off the leash of Ming\u2019s psychic control.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>TEMPER STILL SIMMERING\u2014and that wasn\u2019t the only thing\u2014Riaz got dressed in plain black athletic pants made of a light material that didn\u2019t overheat, his upper body bare, and walked out to the training run just in time to see a group of the more experienced soldiers cross the finish line. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d he asked Judd, who\u2019d been overseeing the session.</p><p>\u201cCurses were cast on your name.\u201d Judd\u2019s expression remained unchanged, his sense of humor a subtle thing. \u201cThe course is a tough one, but wolves enjoy challenge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do Psy.\u201d He knew that as a Tk, Judd was brutal competition. \u201cMe and you.\u201d The painful fury of energy in his body needed somewhere to go.</p><p>But Judd shook his head, dark hair catching the deep orange rays of the slowly setting sun. \u201cI have dinner with Walker and the kids. Tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Riaz opted to remain behind after the other lieutenant left with the rest of the group, deciding to run the course on his own. That was when he caught an unexpected scent on the breeze.</p><p>Crushed ice over berries ... licked with an unexpected undertone of lingering warmth.</p><p>His jaw tightened when Adria emerged from the trees, his wolf reacting with a snarl even as his cock hardened. The response was so hot, so fast, and so beyond his conscious control that it infuriated him.</p><p>Not saying a word, Adria kicked off her boots and socks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dressed right.\u201d It came out a near growl.</p><p>A fluid shrug that revealed the lithe muscle on that tall frame. \u201cJeans are worn in.\u201d</p><p>His wolf heard the unspoken challenge, flashed its canines. \u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d With that, he ran up the smooth wooden log that had been the downfall of more than one SnowDancer, conscious of Adria making the climb with an almost feline grace.</p><p>Instead of a wall at the top of the slope, there was now a specially designed rope climbing frame that required rigid muscle control to navigate. It favored those of lighter weight, and Adria beat him to the top\u2014and to the ring ladder that tested upper-body strength. He was much stronger than her by any measure, and they were neck and neck again by the time they reached the final set of rings.</p><p>Dropping to the firm ground, he made his way through the dark and narrow tunnel built to provide no purchase for claws and nails, its walls seeping a slick gel that frustrated forward movement. He\u2019d created the obstacle, but he was swearing by the time he got to the end\u2014beside an Adria who had tendrils of jet black hair stuck to her temples and cheeks, and then they were wiping off the gel and scrambling across the jungle gym.</p><p>Focusing only on navigating the complex structure, he shut out the presence of the woman he could still taste, still feel clenching so tight and liquid on his fingers. He\u2019d always known he would one day take a lover. Lisette\u2014a near-blinding stab of pain\u2014was happily married, would never belong to him. It was a truth nothing could change, and he\u2019d understood he\u2019d have to accept that before it destroyed him.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t ready yet.</p><p>Even if he had been, he\u2019d always assumed the woman with whom he ended his celibate existence would be warm, affectionate, someone who understood the wound that was his heart.</p><p>Not a near stranger who might as well have been a razor blade.</p><p>His arms aching, he came down on his feet after successfully reaching the end of the jungle gym and looked back to see Adria hanging on to a section that had fallen in, courtesy of the random algorithm that had almost dumped him on his ass halfway through. There was no way she\u2019d catch up to him now, but teeth gritted, she pulled herself back and onto the top of the structure. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Impressed despite himself, he didn\u2019t do her the insult of not putting his all into the rest of the course, the ground hard beneath his bare feet.

His anger turned quiet, deadly, cold. \u201cYou just want to sleep together, is that it?\u201d</p> <p>Slender fingers flexing, clenching again. \u201cI\u2019m talking about sharing intimate skin privileges\u201d\u2014red painted her cheekbones\u2014\u201cnothing forbidden or taboo among packmates.

He could barely see straight, much less think, but he knew one thing. \u201cYou\u2019re not a woman I\u2019ll ever want in my bed.\u201d</p><p>Adria could feel her face burning, the heat blistering, but she didn\u2019t run off, tail between her legs. \u201cCan\u2019t get much clearer than that.\u201d</p><p>Riaz didn\u2019t respond, just watched her with those lethal eyes of beaten gold.</p><p>\u201cWe have to work together,\u201d she said, refusing to allow him to intimidate her, though his dominance shoved at her own until it was an almost physical force. It took everything she had to hold her ground. In truth, her wolf should have already backed down in front of a bigger, deadlier predator, but her little \u201csecret\u201d about her exact place in the hierarchy gave her just enough latitude to withstand the unleashed power of him for a few more moments.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want the ... issues between us\u201d\u2014raging sexual arousal fused with the red haze of the anger that licked the air\u2014\u201cto bleed over into our working relationship.

No change in his stance.</p> <p>Sweat broke out along her spine, and it took teeth-gritting control to respond with only a curt nod before she left, her hand squeezing the water bottle so hard she crushed the plas in a jarring crackle. It humiliated her that even now, when he\u2019d made it cuttingly evident what he thought of her, the tug she felt toward Riaz was a dark twist of need in her gut. But she hadn\u2019t made senior soldier at twenty-five because she was weak.</p><p>Claws slicing out of her hands, she felt her eyes turn the amber of her wolf.</p><p>Riaz Delgado wouldn\u2019t ever get another invitation from her.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>ADEN WALKED AWAY from the back steps of the house of worship where he\u2019d met Judd Lauren for the second time since the city\u2019s showdown with Pure Psy, coming to a halt beside the teleporter who\u2019d brought him to the location.</p><p>Vasic\u2019s eyes remained trained on the former Arrow until Judd disappeared around the corner and into the streets of San Francisco, a shadow among shadows. \u201cHe still moves like one of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn all the ways that matter, he still is one of us.\u201d</p><p>Vasic said nothing more, but a second later they were no longer in the trees behind the church, but on an isolated mountain plateau draped in the silken veil of night. The night sky was crystal clear, dotted with stars so bright, they cut like glass.</p><p>Many termed the PsyNet, the vast network that connected all Psy to one another, a starscape, but Aden had come to realize the PsyNet was missing something fundamental. Its essence, its life was devoid of that which drew even an Arrow\u2019s eye to the night sky. \u201cI expected the desert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth locations allow us to talk without being overheard.\u201d Vasic\u2019s eyes, a cool gray that never gave away anything, stared out past the edge of the plateau to the gnarled trees that sprawled out into the sumptuous black of a moonless night.</p><p>Aden knew what Vasic sought in the darkness, but they would not talk of it this night. Instead, he said, \u201cDo you think Henry Scott is dead?\u201d The Councilor had been hit by the cold fire of an X, but no one had seen him burn to ash\u2014and he\u2019d been surrounded by teleport-capable Tks.</p><p>Vasic\u2019s hair lifted in the wind, the strands having grown in the past months, until they were now past the unspoken regulation length for Arrows. \u201cUnconfirmed, but he had his best men around him. The probability is high they pulled him out in time.\u201d</p><p>Aden had come to the same conclusion. \u201cIf he is alive, he\u2019s learned some new tricks, or someone is helping him conceal his presence in the Net.\u201d The changes in Henry had become apparent prior to the battle. Before the sudden emergence of an unexpected and impossible military expertise, the Councilor had been the beta member of the Henry-Shoshanna pairing.</p><p>\u201cMing.\u201d Vasic continued to stare outward even as he spoke, and Aden wondered how much of him remained here, on this cold, windswept plateau.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may have advised and used Henry to his own ends, but Ming wouldn\u2019t protect him once he was weakened and no longer of any strategic use.\u201d</p><p>Aden\u2019s thoughts meshed so perfectly with Vasic\u2019s, he didn\u2019t waste time voicing his agreement. \u201cThe surviving members of Pure Psy remain fanatically devoted to him.\u201d Silence was meant to have eliminated all emotion from their race, but cracks had begun to appear in the chill fabric of the conditioning each and every one of them underwent as children. Pure Psy might decry those cracks and style itself as a proponent of \u201cPurity,\u201d but the depth of their commitment to Henry brought their own conditioning into question. \u201cThere might well be a strong telepath amongst them.\u201d One skilled enough to block the visible presence of Henry\u2019s mind in the Net.</p><p>\u201cHave you begun a trace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Chosen for Arrow training only because his parents had both been Arrows, Aden was officially a field medic, his telepathic touch so subtle, he\u2019d always been classified in the wrong\u2014much lower\u2014Gradient. Walker Lauren was the first person who had understood the dangerous power of Aden\u2019s mind ... and he had kept Aden\u2019s secret, taught him skills Aden used to this day. \u201cIf Henry is alive, I\u2019ll find him.\u201d</p><p>Checking an incoming message on the computronic gauntlet on his left arm, a gauntlet that Aden had watched become a living part of his body after the experimental fusion took final hold this past year, Vasic said, \u201cDid you speak to Abbott again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. He stays with us.\u201d The Tk had been on the verge of defecting from the squad to join Pure Psy.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say to convince him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat Pure Psy wants to maintain the current power structure when that power structure has proven irreparably defective.\u201d Arrows were not stupid, had never simply been brawn\u2014until Jax. Long-term use of the drug turned them into mindless weapons, but unbeknownst to those who would leash them, Jax was no longer administered to a single Arrow. \u201cWhat Abbott wants,\u201d Aden continued, \u201cis something else altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn Arrow cannot want anything if he is to remain an Arrow.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing in Vasic\u2019s voice to betray the memory, but Aden knew his fellow Arrow had learned that lesson after having his leg broken multiple times as a six-year-old who\u2019d expressed a desire to return home. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure he understands not to expose himself to outsiders.\u201d Loyalty within the squad was unspoken and absolute.</p><p>Stepping up to the very edge of the plateau, Aden felt more than saw Vasic come to stand beside him. The mountain fell away steeply in front of them, and it was a stark reminder of the plunge the Net was on the verge of taking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The only question was how many would die in the fall.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>SIENNA ADORED BEING mated to Hawke. Living with him, however, she thought as the hands of her antique clock flicked over to seven a.m., was taking some adjustment. It wasn\u2019t that she wasn\u2019t used to cohabiting with others\u2014since her defection from the ice of the PsyNet, she\u2019d lived primarily with Walker and the kids. It was the fact that Hawke was so dominant, he tended to take over all available space simply by breathing.</p> <p>\u201cThis is mine,\u201d she said, staking a claim on seventy-five percent of the closet. It had been only last week that they\u2019d had the chance to transfer the majority of her things to Hawke\u2019s quarters, they\u2019d both been so busy with other duties in the aftermath of the battle with Pure Psy. \u201cYou can have this section.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged those glorious shoulders and put down his mug on top of the small set of shelves that had once stood beside the door to her single-occupancy room, the scent of his coffee rich and evocative. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Fine, she admitted in a grumpy internal mutter, that hadn\u2019t exactly been a big battle. Her gorgeous, maddening mate lived in T-shirts and jeans\u2014though when he did put on a suit ... the word was \u201cdelectable.\u201d \u201cAlso,\u201d she said, refusing to be derailed from her bad mood, \u201cstop stealing my coffee.\u201d It was a special blend Drew always brought back for her from a very specific shop in San Diego.</p><p>Hawke grinned and took another sip before returning the mug\u2014gifted to him by Marlee, after her niece had painted a somewhat wolflike creature on the ceramic\u2014to its resting spot. \u201cIt\u2019s good coffee.\u201d Stripping off the sweatpants he\u2019d put on after his shower, he pulled on some jeans, his lips curving in a smile that made her breath catch. \u201cYou look good in my T-shirt.\u201d</p><p>Groaning, she sat down on the bed, resisting the temptation to walk over and rub her cheek against the soft pelt of hair that covered his chest, her need for him a gut-deep pulse. \u201cI sound demented.\u201d Shrewish and spoiled. \u201cOf course you can have the coffee.\u201d She\u2019d made enough for two, was utterly delighted by the fact he enjoyed the way she brewed it.</p> <p>He waited for her to make it every morning, always kissed the curve of her neck in thanks. The same way she waited for him to slice the bread he picked up a couple of times a week from a bakery just outside den territory, when she could as easily do the task herself. Little rituals. Little pieces of their lives. The idea that they were laying the foundations of their shared history ... it made her so happy it hurt. Which was why she was bewildered by her fit of temper. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Expression suddenly solemn, he came down on his haunches in front of her, his jeans only partly buttoned and all distracting. \u201cI know what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyes from his chest\u2014and lower\u2014to his face. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby, I do.\u201d A sheepish look. \u201cI\u2019m crowding you, pushing you, even in our quarters, but I swear I\u2019m not doing it on purpose.\u201d</p><p>She had zero resistance against him when he got like this, when she could see both man and wolf watching her with a tenderness that quite simply, undid her. Closing her hands over the warm silk of his shoulders, she stroked and petted until a lazy growl rumbled in his chest. \u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d hate it if you were holding back with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d He angled his neck in a silent request, and she gently massaged a spot that would\u2019ve made him purr had he been a cat.</p> <p>Mine.</p><p>The possessive thought was familiar\u2014Hawke brought out her most primitive instincts. \u201cJust so you know, when I get really mad, I might singe your eyebrows,\u201d she murmured, because she knew if she gave an inch, he\u2019d take not a mile, but the entire road.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Lashes lifting, he curved his hand around her neck to tug her down. \u201cThen we can kiss and make up. Twice.\u201d</p><p>She laughed into the slow, deep seduction of his kiss, her breasts tightening against the soft cotton of the T-shirt she\u2019d grabbed when she woke\u2014the whole idea of a nightgown or pajamas was ridiculous with an alpha wolf in bed with her. Nothing ever stayed on. Half the time, the nightclothes ended up shredded. So now she just stole his T-shirts when she woke. He, of course, was pure changeling, had no problem with nudity.</p><p>Not that she minded the view.</p><p>Breaking the kiss to take a breath, she brushed back the damp thickness of his hair, her thighs spread on either side of his body, his hands warm and possessive below the hem of the T-shirt. \u201cWhat do you have planned today?\u201d she asked, her heart wrenching at the perfection of this moment where she had the right to touch him, to care for him, to call him her own.</p><p>He nipped at her fingers before answering, the wolf playing with her. \u201cI think I\u2019ll spend most of the day with Felix and his team.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help her instinctive flinch at the memory of exactly how the area being replanted had become so barren, every tiny blade of grass turned to ash.</p> <p>Hawke\u2019s response was to bite sharply at her lower lip. \u201cI told you not to do that.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, she rubbed at the sting. \u201cI\u2019m allowed to think about what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you did was save the lives of your packmates.\u201d Tugging her close, he suckled the spot he\u2019d bitten, soothing the momentary hurt. \u201cThat\u2019s what counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sorry I did what I did.\u201d It had been a choice made in battle, against an enemy that wouldn\u2019t stop. No matter how many years she lived, she would never forget the crunching, ugly sound of a hundred guns smashing into the skulls of dazed and wounded SnowDancers. Her act had been the right one at that time, in that place. \u201cIt\u2019s just...\u201d She\u2019d annihilated the Pure Psy army, killed so many men and women who\u2019d had the misfortune to pick the wrong side.</p><p>Her wolf held her gaze. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>So she did. And he listened. He understood. Until she could breathe again, her chest expanding with each inhale. It wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d spoken of that terrible day, neither would it be the last\u2014but knowing that he\u2019d be there anytime she needed him, it was everything.</p><p>\u201cAny other plans for the day?\u201d she asked afterward, fixing his hair because she loved playing with it ... and because touching Hawke calmed her on the deepest level, until sometimes, when the memories hit too hard, he simply shifted and allowed her to pet the huge silver-gold wolf that was the other half of his nature, as long as she needed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take Harley down with me,\u201d he said, arching his neck when she ran her nails over his scalp the way he liked. \u201cIt\u2019ll give me an opportunity to see how he\u2019s developing.\u201d Another pleasured growl, his hands flexing against her skin.</p><p>Her mate made her so damn glad she was a woman. \u201cHas he stabilized?\u201d The young male was shaping up to be a powerful dominant.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting there. Boy\u2019s got a strong will.\u201d He squeezed her thighs with those hands she\u2019d felt on every inch of her body. \u201cLike someone else I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the wolf pushes you,\u201d he said, pressing a kiss to the inside of her knee that made her shiver. \u201cWolf and man both know you\u2019ll push back. It\u2019d be no fun if you were a weakling.\u201d</p><p>Seduced, she was being utterly seduced by a wolf who knew her far too well. \u201cThe thing with the maternal females?\u201d They hadn\u2019t had a chance to talk much the previous night, the dinner going later than expected. Given the people around the table, it was unsurprising the talk had turned to the increasing instability of the PsyNet.</p><p>Judd had disappeared around ten, heading for a meeting with his contacts, so it was likely he\u2019d have more data to share with Hawke today. After he did, Sienna knew Hawke would make it a point to talk the information over with her\u2014a true alpha pair needed to forge a trust that ran deeper than sensuality, than the mating bond. It had to encompass the very heart of what it took to keep SnowDancer strong. \u201cYou survived the meeting at least.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s groan was eloquent. \u201cI have a headache just thinking about it. Ask me again after sex and I might have the will to talk about it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNice to know I\u2019m not the only one scared by Nell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing scares me, least of all a woman who is maybe all of a hundred-and-ten pounds and happens to be three years my junior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep telling yourself that.\u201d</p><p>Narrowed wolf eyes. \u201cSmart-asses get their comeuppance.\u201d Stroking his hands up under the edge of the T-shirt, he ran his thumbs over the sensitive crease of her thighs, smiled a very wolfish smile at the tremor that shook her. \u201cYou were quiet when we were discussing the mating ceremony last night.\u201d</p><p>Playing with the hair at his nape, she bit the inside of her lip. \u201cI wish we\u2019d done it earlier.\u201d They\u2019d decided to wait until things calmed a little and all the evacuated children had settled back into the den, but the delay had caused her nerves to fray. \u201cIt\u2019ll be the first Pack event since...\u201d Since everyone had discovered what she could do, what she was. \u201cMaybe we should do it together with Walker and Lara\u2019s ceremony,\u201d she said, though she knew it was too late, the celebration only days away.</p><p>\u201cEach ceremony is unique and suited to the couple.\u201d Hawke bracketed her face in his hands, and she knew he understood what she didn\u2019t say. \u201cThey want a quieter affair.\u201d</p><p>And he was alpha, the ceremony celebrating his mating one of the biggest events to be held in the den in recent memory. Every packmate, young and old, wanted to contribute, to be part of the festivities, and Sienna wasn\u2019t going to cheat them of that\u2014not even if she wanted to hide in a corner and hope no one would notice her.</p><p>Hawke pressed a finger to her lips before she could speak. \u201cI told you, baby, we\u2019re wolves.\u201d Wild affection, the endearment one he used with her alone. \u201cWe respect strength.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m only a soldier.\u201d Hierarchy was a critical component of the pack\u2019s stability\u2014and their relationship fell outside of it. Never would she give it up, but the impact of it on the pack still worried her at times. \u201cYoung and inexperienced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t always about age or experience,\u201d Hawke said, eyes of husky blue holding her captive. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll have to earn your stripes when it comes to your personal dominance, but you\u2019ve already got their loyalty\u2014because you gave the pack your own, laid your life on the line to protect. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d</p><p>Curling her arms around his shoulders, she leaned into his embrace. He hugged her close, stroking a big hand down her back. No one in the pack had said or done anything to make her feel unwelcome after the battle, it was true. There had been more than a few smiles thrown her way and the teasing they received as a newly mated couple was merciless, but\u2014\u201cSome people are scared of me,\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>Hawke chuckled. \u201cBaby, most people are scared of me.\u201d He nuzzled a kiss into her neck. \u201cIt goes with the territory.\u201d</p><p>RIAZ ducked his head into Hawke\u2019s office the morning after his confrontation with Adria, but found the alpha missing. \u201cRiley,\u201d he called out, running to catch up to the lieutenant. \u201cYou seen Hawke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone to join Felix\u2019s team.\u201d Riley glanced at the small datapad in his hand. \u201cNo set time for returning to the den\u2014try him on his sat phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll run down and pitch in.\u201d Hard, manual labor would be good for him. He was strung tight from the primal fury that had raged through his body in the midnight hours. And it wasn\u2019t Lisette\u2019s face that had haunted him. Not last night.</p><p>\u201cFelix says the ground is perfect for planting, as if it had been fertilized.\u201d Riley\u2019s eyes were intent. \u201cHe\u2019s never seen anything like it. I guess none of us have.\u201d</p> <p>No, nothing had ever come close to the deadly beauty of Sienna\u2019s cold fire. \u201cI know she\u2019s young,\u201d Riaz said, remembering not just the red-gold glow of that voracious flame but also the screams that had come before, the sickening crunches of bone as SnowDancer after SnowDancer fell, bloody and broken. \u201cBut anyone who can control that much power has my respect.\u201d</p><p>Riley\u2019s response was unexpected. \u201cMake sure you share that view with packmates when the opportunity rises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrouble?\u201d He hadn\u2019t sensed anything, but he wasn\u2019t as connected to the heartbeat of the den as Riley. Based here his entire life, the senior lieutenant was not only an anchor for his packmates, Hawke included, he was also a man trusted by everyone from hard-eyed soldiers and busy maternals, to rebellious juveniles, and elders.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the other male now said. \u201cBut the battle was the first time most of the pack became aware of what Judd and Sienna can do. Right now, everyone\u2019s high from the success, but once the adrenaline fades and they start to think about it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014people will begin to realize exactly how dangerous those two are.\u201d Riaz nodded, seeing where Riley was headed. \u201cWe need to bolster that good feeling now, so even when the high wears off, everyone will continue to see them as strong packmates who\u2019ll use their strength to protect the weak, not Psy they need to be wary of.\u201d Wolves might be predators, but the majority weren\u2019t dominants. SnowDancer\u2019s most vulnerable members would be all but helpless against the kind of power wielded by Judd and Sienna, and, though most people didn\u2019t realize the strength of his telepathy, Walker.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Riley kept his voice low as they spoke. \u201cI\u2019m probably being overcautious, but\u201d\u2014a rueful smile\u2014\u201cthat\u2019s why they pay me the big bucks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re right. Better to subtly reassure everyone now, when they\u2019re already predisposed to love the Laurens, rather than later, after fear\u2019s crept into the fold.\u201d He made a note to have some quiet, casual conversations with certain people. \u201cYou need me for anything today? If not, I\u2019ll head down to join the planting team now.\u201d He needed to do something physical\u2014his skin felt stretched too tight, too thin over the raging need of his body.</p><p>It had never been this bad. As a lone wolf, he was predisposed to periods of solitude that would drive his packmates crazy, and could last even longer without touch. He hadn\u2019t been with anyone for roughly four months when he\u2019d met Lisette six months ago and felt that stunning, indescribable kick to the gut that was the instinctive knowledge of his mate.</p><p>Intellectually, he\u2019d understood that while it wasn\u2019t common, it could happen in such a way\u2014that a wolf could turn around and just know a woman was meant to be his own, without ever having spoken to her, but nothing could\u2019ve prepared him for the impact of that moment. Every cell in his body had sung at the nearness of Lisette\u2019s presence, his senses utterly attuned to her, his body vibrating with the realization that it was her. More than a lover, more than a friend, a mate was meant to be a changeling wolf\u2019s other half and he\u2019d found his.</p><p>The soul-savaging fact that she belonged to another ... it might\u2019ve stopped the mate bond coming into being, but it did nothing to quiet the mating urge that had gripped him in sharp teeth and held on tight. Deeply intertwined with that urge was a promise so primal, he\u2019d never before given it any thought ... a promise of fidelity: A wolf who found his mate only ever shared intimate skin privileges with her.</p><p>That promise came from so deep in his wolf\u2019s heart that regardless of the fact Lisette would never be his, he\u2019d been unable to bear the thought of any other woman\u2019s touch, his gut roiling. As a result, it had been close to a year since he\u2019d shared intimate skin privileges\u2014a long time for even a lone wolf, especially a dominant, but he\u2019d had a grip on it. The lack of contact had hurt at times, but it hadn\u2019t been all-encompassing, threatening to blind him.</p><p>Then had come Adria and the constant prickle across his skin, the irritation he hadn\u2019t understood until she\u2019d pushed him to ignition point. His cock hardened at the memory of her coming so wild and hot around his fingers, the ice and crushed berries of her scent intermingled with a dark feminine musk that had acted like a drug on his senses. She\u2019d been right in the clearing. Now that he\u2019d come face-to-face with the vicious lust that had driven his response to her from the start, he couldn\u2019t undo it, couldn\u2019t go back to a time when he didn\u2019t want her, the echo of their explosive encounter taunting him in his dreams.</p><p>\u201cGo for it.\u201d Riley\u2019s voice broke into his thoughts. \u201cFelix needs as many warm bodies as he can get.\u201d He pulled up a file on his datapad. \u201cGrab some juveniles on your way down.\u201d A pause. \u201cThe males. It\u2019ll keep the maternals happy and make the boys too tired to get into trouble.\u201d</p><p>A sudden memory made Riaz grin. \u201cRemember that time Hawke, Coop, you, and I got caught with those films?\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 10</p><p>\u201cTHOSE FILMS WERE worth scrubbing the toilets for a month.\u201d Riley\u2019s expression was solemn, in direct opposition to the amusement dancing in his eyes. \u201cI learned a whole lot of things. Still trying to track down a copy of that third film.\u201d</p><p>Wolf huffing in laughter, his tension momentarily eased, Riaz went off to grab the misbehaving boys. They groaned at being conscripted, but didn\u2019t protest. Instead, falling in beside Riaz as they ran down at an easy pace, they peppered him with questions about training, the battle, and how best to court girls without it crossing over into forbidden territory.</p><p>It was the last thing Riaz wanted to think about, much less discuss, but he didn\u2019t snarl at the lanky young teens\u2014from the way a number of them had been moping around yesterday, they\u2019d obviously already gotten an earful from either the maternals or Hawke, more than likely both.</p><p>Pulling on the resources that made him a lieutenant, he answered their questions with blunt truths\u2014there was no use coddling wolf males at this age. Their laughter and friendly ribbing of one another, especially at the occasional embarrassed blush, further calmed the feral wolf inside him, until he was nearly sane by the time he arrived at what had been a wasteland directly after the battle, but was now a hive of activity, hundreds of saplings already set out, ready to be snugged into the earth.</p><p>\u201cShovels.\u201d He passed them out from the stockpile in one corner, then led his group over to Felix, who set them all to digging, the actual planting being done by those the horticultural specialist had trained in how to handle the roots of the saplings. When Joshua showed an interest in the task, Felix paired the juvenile with Lucy, so he could learn to do it correctly.</p><p>Surrounded by the scents and voices of his pack, Riaz\u2019s shoulders relaxed that final inch.</p><p>The time passed in a burn of muscles, and the moist, rich smell of the earth and of budding, growing things, and he was quietly contented by the time darkness whispered on the horizon. Having sent the younger kids back much earlier, with most of the other helpers following an hour ago, he assisted Felix and the small group that remained tidy away the empty pots, forgotten shovels, and discarded gloves.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a massive project,\u201d he said, leaning the last shovel inside the temporary storage shed before stepping back so Felix could secure the door.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be done faster than you know it.\u201d Door shut, Felix turned to wave off the final truck but for the one he intended to drive up, his features as refined as an aristocrat\u2019s. That classically handsome face, combined with his muscled six-feet-three frame, had made him a successful model while in college. Even now, luxury goods companies chased him to front campaigns, but Felix\u2019s true love was the earth and its flora, his thickly lashed brown eyes bright with satisfaction as he looked out at what they\u2019d already achieved. \u201cHawke\u2019s going to conscript me helpers on a constant rotation. Six weeks max and we\u2019ll be done.\u201d</p><p>Their alpha walked over at that moment, clapping Felix on the shoulder. \u201cSix weeks? Bloody hell, Felix, you\u2019re a drill sergeant in disguise.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Felix grinned, glancing up to meet Hawke\u2019s eyes for a fleeting second before his gaze skated away, his submissive nature uncomfortable with the eye contact. However, his position in the hierarchy made no difference on this playing field\u2014here, they all took orders from him, because here, Felix was the one who knew what he was doing.</p><p>Now, the other man shoved his hands into the front pockets of his jeans. \u201cI\u2019m pumped to see it coming together after all the planning. It\u2019ll take a while for the area to regenerate, but a few years from now, no one will be able to tell this patch from any other in the territory.\u201d</p><p>Hawke looked up at the sky streaked with the final fading embers of sunset, lines of tension bracketing his mouth. \u201cI hate that we\u2019ve got this massive gap where the satellites can spy on us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s on the edge of the territory,\u201d Riaz pointed out. \u201cUnless you plan to put on a ballet performance while covered in nothing but chicken feathers, they aren\u2019t going to see anything interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Hawke said with a straight face. \u201cAnd here I\u2019d already plucked the chickens.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, the three of them headed for the truck. The alpha jumped into the flatbed at the back, alongside Riaz. As they were the final three to leave, it was a peaceful if yet barren view that drew away from them when Felix started the engine and began the journey home.</p><p>Back propped against the cab of the truck, Riaz let the wind rifle through his hair, grunting when the ride turned bumpy. \u201cDoesn\u2019t this thing have hover facility?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d answer but I think I just lost a tooth.\u201d</p> <p>The hydraulics sounded on the heels of Hawke\u2019s words, creaking and groaning before they successfully lifted the truck off the ground.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s well past time we replaced this,\u201d the alpha said, patting the side of the truck. \u201cBut Eli was the one who originally bought it for the pack, and he\u2019s attached to the rust bucket. I think he calls it Sheila.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheila?\u201d Riaz grinned. This was why he\u2019d come home, heart-bruised and licking his wounds, wary of the solitude that had always been so integral to his nature. No one could fix the hurt, but his pack ... they gave him the gift of laughter, wrapped him in warmth, and kept him busy. Until he could almost forget the jagged hole that was his heart, its edges bleeding and raw.</p><p>A wild tangle of a kiss. A lithe female body twisting against his own, her legs locking around his waist. His fingers slick with her need. His cock pulsing with the urge to thrust deep.</p><p>Hissing out a silent breath, he strangled the roar of sensory memory. He\u2019d damn well forgotten his mate then, hadn\u2019t he? Not only forgotten, but betrayed in the basest of fashions. The worst of it was that the memory of his hotly erotic encounter with Adria aroused him every single time, his gut clenching not in repudiation, but in claw-raking desire.</p><p>\u201cMy father,\u201d Hawke said as they passed under the shadow of a towering pine, its thick trunk scarred with the marks from a hundred claws, \u201cwas a lone wolf.\u201d</p> <p>Folding his arms on his knees, Riaz continued to keep his eyes on the forest path retreating behind them, the failing light turning the trees into distant smudges. \u201cI know.\u201d A year older than Hawke, he\u2019d been a gangly boy about to head into his teens when Hawke\u2019s father was killed, the pack drenched in blood.</p><p>Even so young, Hawke had already begun showing his inclination to be at the center of pack life, while Riaz had preferred to prowl alone through the mountains. Yet in spite of their differences, they\u2019d gotten along. Some part of him had seen in the boy Hawke had been, the man he would one day become. And when the pack almost broke under a hail of pain and violence, he\u2019d made the decision to follow that boy rather than striking out on his own as so many lone wolves did.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why,\u201d Hawke continued, \u201cI understand lone wolves better than most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father was mated.\u201d It was the single thing that changed a lone wolf\u2019s soul-deep need for long stretches of solitude\u2014transforming it into a devotion so intense, they became more possessive and protective than any of their brethren. Some people said a lone wolf spent his life searching for that one person who could become his lodestar.</p><p>\u201cHe had friends who weren\u2019t.\u201d Hawke propped his arms loosely over his knees in a mirror of Riaz\u2019s position. \u201cThat means I know lone wolves have friends. Who are you talking to, Riaz?\u201d It was a blunt question. \u201cNot Coop, or he\u2019d be down here kicking your ass so I wouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>Riaz gripped the wrist of one hand with the other, squeezed. Cooper and he had grown up together, gotten into trouble together, and made lieutenant together. The other man knew him better than almost anyone else on this earth\u2014which was why Riaz couldn\u2019t afford to show his face in Cooper\u2019s sector. The only reason Coop hadn\u2019t picked up on the fact that something was wrong when Riaz first returned home, was that he\u2019d been distracted by his pursuit of Grace, the woman who was now his mate.</p><p>Instead of admitting the fact he\u2019d been avoiding Coop, Riaz said, \u201cSince when are we girls who have to have heart-to-hearts?\u201d</p><p>His flippant answer didn\u2019t faze Hawke. \u201cYou think I\u2019ll let you get away with bullshit, you don\u2019t know me.\u201d A hard stare. \u201cHave you even been to visit your folks?\u201d</p> <p>His parents were currently based in San Diego. They\u2019d wanted to be closer to their only grandchild, three-year-old Marisol, the child of his younger brother, Gage. \u201cAre you seriously asking me that?\u201d It was a snarl of disbelief. \u201cOf course I went. Right after I came back into the country.\u201d If he hadn\u2019t, his mother would\u2019ve been knocking on his door, and there would\u2019ve been hell to pay. No one messed with Abigail Delgado</p><p>Hawke\u2019s shoulder brushed his as Felix tilted the vehicle to get around an overgrown elderberry bush. \u201cI think you need to go visit them again.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s wolf bristled. Maybe Hawke was alpha, but Riaz was a lieutenant\u2014that meant he had the strength and the dominance to bloody the other man in a fight. \u201cWhat delusion makes you think you have the right to give me orders about my personal life?\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s response was a harsh bark of laughter. \u201cFuck, you remind me of what I was like a few months back. Don\u2019t be a stupid ass like I was.\u201d</p><p>Riaz released his wrist. Blood began to flow again in a hot rush, causing painful pinpricks of sensation. Hawke, he thought, was perhaps the one person in the pack who wouldn\u2019t just understand but would know what it had done to him to lose Lisette without ever having had her. Still ... \u201cI can\u2019t talk about it yet,\u201d he said, the words rocks scraping his throat.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Hawke replied, the wolf in his voice. \u201cBut, Riaz? You\u2019re home now. The pack is only going to give you so much rope\u2014and we certainly won\u2019t let you hang yourself with it.\u201d</p><p>He should leave, Riaz thought, get the hell away from den territory, from an alpha who saw too much, and most of all, from a woman who incited a raw sexual hunger that made him so angry it was a white-hot flash through his bloodstream. But the painful fact was, he wasn\u2019t ready to walk alone again, a hard thing for a lone wolf to accept.</p><p>Maybe Hawke was right. Maybe he needed to go see his family. He\u2019d eat his mother\u2019s divine cooking, tease his pretty little sister-in-law, play with his dimpled hellion of a niece, drink a beer with Gage and his father, and get his head screwed on straight. The one thing he did not need to do was to give in to the gnawing compulsion to track the subtle scent of wild berries crushed in ice until he had Adria\u2019s nude, sweat-slicked body pinned under the hard demand of his own.</p><p>ADRIA came around a cedar, its distinctive red-orange bark gray in the dark, to see Sienna waving at her. \u201cAre you taking over my shift?\u201d the younger woman asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Again, Adria was struck by Sienna\u2019s youth, her instincts as protective toward the novice soldier as they were toward Evie. But she had to accept that those cardinal eyes ... they were of someone far older and wiser. \u201cAnything I need to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee that tree over there?\u201d Sienna pointed out the huge black oak, its canopy a sprawling shadow. \u201cPair of nesting eagles. Steer clear\u2014they\u2019re being very territorial.\u201d She tugged on her braid. \u201cI almost lost this when I ventured too close.\u201d</p><p>Having fallen foul of a nesting eagle herself once, Adria knew Sienna had had a lucky escape. \u201cBefore I forget\u2014Evie asked me to remind you that you two have a dinner date.\u201d Again, it was a surprise, that her gentle niece was best friends with this tough young woman who\u2019d been forged in deadly fire.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to it all day.\u201d A guarded but not unfriendly smile. \u201cEvie said you\u2019re an expert in martial arts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA particular discipline,\u201d Adria corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the more aggressive forms.\u201d She\u2019d had to utilize it in the battle in a bid to protect fallen SnowDancers from the enemy. Her own ears had been bleeding heavily after the sonic blast, her balance shot, but she\u2019d still been able to function on some level, and so she\u2019d fought.</p><p>Right beside Riaz.</p><p>His arm all but flayed to the bone by a laser burn, his eardrums shattered, he\u2019d nonetheless refused to go down. And when she\u2019d been too slow and taken a fracturing kick to the shoulder, he\u2019d acted as a living shield until she could punch in a localized painkiller and rise to fight again. The man might be a bastard personally, Adria thought, her jaw tight, but he was blood-loyal with unflinching courage under fire. \u201cI was thinking of talking to Indigo about offering a class to her novices,\u201d she said, strangling her body\u2019s unwanted response to thoughts of the dark-haired lone wolf. \u201cAre you interested?\u201d</p><p>An immediate nod. \u201cThe reason I was asking is because Evie told me it can be modified to suit a physically smaller individual.\u201d</p><p>Smart girl\u2014aware not only of her strengths but also her weaknesses. Then again, no alpha wolf, much less Hawke, would\u2019ve been attracted to anyone who didn\u2019t have a brain. \u201cYes, absolutely. This might be one of the times we split classes according to height and weight.\u201d She glanced at her watch. \u201cYou\u2019d better head back or I\u2019ll hear all about it from Evie tomorrow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sienna laughed, more comfortable with Adria than she usually was with people she didn\u2019t know well. And it wasn\u2019t because the senior soldier shared a strong family resemblance with the Riviere women, all of whom Sienna trusted. The truth was, Adria reminded Sienna most of Riley.</p><p>They both had the same quiet, unflashy confidence intertwined with an earthy warmth, the same sense of being a rock in the storm. Sienna didn\u2019t know the pack as well as Hawke did, but she had the gut-deep feeling Adria would soon become one of the unspoken anchors in the den, a woman people went to for levelheaded advice given without judgment or pity.</p><p>As she said, \u201cHave a nice night,\u201d and headed off, she saw Adria\u2019s smile fade, to be replaced by a much more stark expression, her eyes going the amber of her wolf. And it struck her that perhaps, the protective armor of someone like Adria was the hardest of all to penetrate\u2014because she gave the appearance of being an open book ... until no one was even aware of the tangled emotions that might lie beneath.</p> <p>Chapter 11</p><p>VASQUEZ\u2019S GREATEST SKILL was in going unnoticed. It was part of why Councilor Henry Scott had handpicked him to lead the Pure Psy army before the confrontation with the changelings. The fact Vasquez had survived that annihilation spoke both to his intelligence and his ability to come out on top in any given situation.</p><p>And the fact he continued to support Pure Psy even as civil war loomed in the PsyNet spoke to his belief that Silence was their race\u2019s only hope for survival. His dedication to the cause had nothing to do with something as useless and debilitating as emotion, for his conditioning was flawless, and everything to do with history: Who had the Psy been before Silence?</p><p>A broken race on the verge of extinction, murderous and insane.</p><p>Now, they ruled the world ... or had done until the changelings gained a clawhold on power. Even the humans were stirring. All as a result of a weak Council, its members ineffectual in holding back the tide of the lesser races. That Council was no longer an issue, and Vasquez had a new set of orders.</p> <p>Repeating them back to ensure he\u2019d understood correctly, he nodded to the person who had given him those orders. \u201cI believe we have three operatives capable of undertaking the task, but I want to watch each carefully, do another deep background check before I consider which one to approach. We must be certain of the operative\u2019s commitment.\u201d</p><p>Good. No mistakes this time.</p><p>Responding verbally to the telepathic statement, he said, \u201cNo. This time, even an X will be powerless to stop us.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>\u201cNEXT TIME YOU decide to stay in the city to attend a lecture series,\u201d Sienna told Evie when she arrived at the den to find the youngest Riviere woman waiting for her, \u201ctake your cell phone.\u201d</p><p>Evie wrinkled her nose. \u201cTai already growled at me for forgetting when he picked me up yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt it\u2014Tai lets you get away with murder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d Evie folded her arms, but her lips were twitching. \u201cThank God. I was beginning to wonder if he planned to treat me like porcelain forever.\u201d</p><p>Sienna snorted. \u201cPoor Tai\u2019s going to get a rude awakening the first time he realizes you have a spine of steel.\u201d Evie had an internal strength that\u2019d take her through any storm.</p><p>\u201cHe knows,\u201d Evie said, unhidden tenderness in her deep gray eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s also a dominant male, so he thinks he\u2019ll always be able to get his own way if he pushes hard enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know all about that.\u201d</p><p>Evie\u2019s laughter wrapped around them before her best friend linked her arm through Sienna\u2019s. \u201cHow about\u2014\u201d She bit off her words. \u201cI was going to say how about we grab some food from the kitchen and go to your quarters, but you have a mate now.\u201d A look of pure delight.</p><p>\u201cHawke\u2019s not in the den.\u201d He was in a meeting with Lucas, Nikita, Anthony, and Nikita\u2019s security chief, Max. She knew that because he\u2019d detoured on his way out of den territory to kiss her, their bodies pressing chest to toe in that affectionate changeling way she\u2019d once envied in other couples. It was utterly as wonderful as she\u2019d thought it would be.</p><p>\u201cMeeting was meant to be tomorrow,\u201d he\u2019d told her, his breath a hot caress against her lips. \u201cBut Nikita\u201d\u2014a growling tone\u2014\u201chas to head urgently out of the city to sort out a business situation, so it\u2019s been brought forward. Normally, I wouldn\u2019t care if she lost some of her billions, but it might affect a workforce of a thousand-plus.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you getting together to do a security review?\u201d Everyone in the region had worked together to repel Pure Psy, and that cooperation continued in the aftermath.</p><p>\u201cYes. The present calm\u2019s no excuse to let down our guard. Especially with what\u2019s apparently happening in the PsyNet.\u201d</p><p>Putting aside\u2014for tonight at least\u2014the solemn knowledge that what was coming would likely be far worse than what had already gone, Sienna glanced at Evie. \u201cCome on, there\u2019s food in the galley in our quarters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you have snacks,\u201d Evie said after they\u2019d entered. \u201cWe\u2019ll be healthy and have vegetables later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Psy. I don\u2019t eat snacks.\u201d It was something she\u2019d once said to Evie, bewildered by the other woman\u2019s overtures of friendship. Evie hadn\u2019t backed off, her stubbornness sweet, gentle\u2014and relentless.</p><p>Now, the two of them laughed as she grabbed a bag of potato chips for Evie, as well as a toffee apple for herself. Her additions to the galley had made Hawke shake his head ... then bring her a sugar-laden treat every Friday. Biting into the apple with a smile, she dropped into the sofa beside Evie and toed off her boots and socks, propping her feet on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll rot your teeth,\u201d Evie said, crunching on a potato chip, the lustrous ebony of her hair curling over the shoulders of her white cashmere cardigan.</p><p>\u201cPot. Kettle. Black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod I love salt.\u201d Another crunch. \u201cSince I have no shame, I\u2019m going to ask you what\u2019s it like being mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful.\u201d Breathtaking enough that it scared her at times. \u201cIt\u2019s the other things that shake me up now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>Sienna had to finagle toffee from her teeth before she could speak. \u201cSuch as knowing I\u2019ve become part of the center of the pack when my natural inclination is to be on the periphery.\u201d She was an X, a cardinal, had been trained to be a covert operative. \u201cI feel so exposed sometimes.\u201d As if everyone was watching her.</p><p>Evie got up to grab them bottles of fruit juice. \u201cThat\u2019s normal, Sin. Any woman who mates an alpha\u2014forget about mating the alpha of the biggest changeling pack in the country\u2014is going to stress a little at the sudden change in status and responsibility. If you didn\u2019t, you\u2019d be a robot.\u201d</p><p>Sienna knew that tone. \u201cYou think I need to cut myself some slack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew constant sex with Hawke hadn\u2019t rotted your brains.\u201d</p><p>Sienna almost choked on the bite of apple in her mouth. Gulping the juice to wash it down, she pointed a finger at Evie. \u201cI should be used to the things that come out of your mouth by now.\u201d</p><p>Evie smiled, beatific.</p><p>Shaking her head, Sienna said, \u201cThanks for the advice.\u201d Evie had a way of cutting right to the heart of a matter, and doing so with a kindness that was innate.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Ms. Type A Personality.\u201d A gentle nudge followed by a glimpse of open vulnerability. \u201cTo be honest, I was a little worried our relationship would change with you being mated. It\u2019s nice to know you still want to talk like we used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll always need to talk to you, Evie.\u201d Friendship was a cherished gift to Sienna, the one she shared with Evie her first and deepest. \u201cI was scared, too,\u201d she confessed, \u201cthat maybe you wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable with me anymore, would censor yourself.\u201d</p><p>Evie rolled her eyes. \u201cIdiot.\u201d</p><p>A knot Sienna hadn\u2019t even been aware of unraveled in her chest. \u201cTalking of mating\u2014you and Tai?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no bond,\u201d Evie said, following Sienna to the galley as she hunted out the ingredients for a salad. \u201cThat\u2019s not unusual at our age. But he\u2019s mine.\u201d She began to wash the lettuce. \u201cI\u2019m going to make him get an \u2018I belong to Evie\u2019 tattoo.\u201d</p><p>Sienna laughed. \u201cPossessive much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTai\u2019s oblivious\u201d\u2014a satisfied smile\u2014\u201cbut some of the older women have been giving him the eye since he filled out.\u201d Evie\u2019s own eyes shifted from gray to a vivid yellow-gold. \u201cJust because I\u2019m submissive doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t find creative and nasty ways to make them sorry if they dare come on to my man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you will. It\u2019s in the best friend code.\u201d</p><p>Such an ordinary byplay, but one she couldn\u2019t have imagined having five years ago. Her life had shifted on its axis more than once during that time, but she\u2019d found her footing before and she\u2019d do it again in this, most exciting new chapter in her life.</p><p>A pulse along the mating bond, a \u201ckiss\u201d from her wolf, a reminder that no matter where the journey took her, she would never again be alone in the dark.</p><p>RIAZ hadn\u2019t warned his mother of his intention to visit, so when he walked into the house midmorning the next day, she not only dropped the plate of cookies she was holding ... but burst into tears.</p><p>Riaz would\u2019ve been alarmed except that she was cupping his face in her soft hands and kissing his cheeks, speaking two thousand miles an hour in a rapid-fire mix of English and Spanish as she berated him for staying away so long.</p><p>Dropping his overnight bag on the otherwise spotlessly clean floor, he enfolded her diminutive form in his arms, the softness she insisted on calling her \u201cpadding\u201d and his father called \u201csexy as hell,\u201d familiar and comforting.</p><p>Her arms wrapped around him in return, strong as steel. Chin resting on her hair, he breathed in fragrant spring flowers, sugar, and warmth. It was the scent of kisses on skinned knees, hugs after school, proud touches when he made soldier, a million fragments of memory. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying,\u201d she said, drawing back and lifting the edge of her apron to wipe away the remnants of her tears.</p><p>He knew an order when he heard it. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>That got him a pat on the cheek and a \u201cSit, I\u2019ll bring you cookies.\u201d</p> <p>He picked up the broom instead to sweep up the detritus from the broken plate and its contents, got a look of approval. Riaz hid a grin. He was well trained. \u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d His father, Jorge, had retired from his job as a teacher but still spent most days handling issues to do with the pups and juveniles in the San Diego area\u2014it kept him content, and out of his wife\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re bringing a group of the young ones to the mating ceremony.

You\u2019re going to make some woman very happy one day.\u201d</p><p>It took effort to keep the smile on his face, to not let his mother see what her words did to him. Wrapping an arm around her, he tucked her against his side and tempted her into a cookie, determined to enjoy his time in San Diego ... but he couldn\u2019t escape the jaw-clenching realization that all thoughts of Lisette were now linked to Adria and the desire that had scorched them both.</p><p>ADRIA ran into Hawke on her way to a meeting that afternoon. When he mentioned that Riaz was in San Diego, shock turned her breathless. Not because Riaz had left the den for what appeared to be a short visit to his family, but because of her own response to the knowledge.</p><p>A tremor of relief rippled over her skin, her spine no longer tight with a fine ever-present tension. She wasn\u2019t so naive as to believe the attraction had run its course\u2014nothing that gut-wrenchingly deep could be so easily conquered. Even now, embers of darkest need flickered in her blood. No, the only reason for her relief was because with him gone, there was no longer any chance she\u2019d forget her vow to keep her distance from a man who had made it crystal clear he\u2019d rather sleep on a bed of nails than with her.</p><p>\u201cHow are you going with the territorial exploration?\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s question snapped her head back into the game\u2014she knew her alpha had to be evaluating her performance as a transfer. \u201cI\u2019m doing a new section each day. I discuss it with Eli or Riley before and after to make sure I don\u2019t miss anything.\u201d</p> <p>The light caught on the distinctive silver-gold of Hawke\u2019s hair as he cocked his head a fraction to the right\u2014the wolf, listening to her. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, his easy expression doing nothing to tone down the sense of naked power that clung to him like a second skin. \u201cAnother thing, Adria\u201d\u2014a moment of searing eye contact\u2014\u201cif there are any issues I need to be aware of, you let me know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Leaving the alpha, her senses prickling with the knowledge that Hawke saw far more than either part of her wanted him to see, she made her way to the weekly senior soldiers meeting. Elias, the man in charge of the group, ribbed her gently for being late, before calling the meeting to order from his leaning stance against a scarred wooden desk so sturdy it would take four men to shift.</p><p>It was a perfect fit for a break room that was happily shabby with its worn-in furniture and massive notice board hung with party invites, take-out menus, printouts of the roster, and an eclectic collection of photos. Word was, the maternal females had been politely but implacably rebuffed when they\u2019d made noises about refurbishing it to match the bright new community areas in the den.</p><p>Adria was glad\u2014this room had its own identity, its steady, comfortable look reflecting the pragmatic men and women who most often used it. Unlike the lieutenants, who had to deal not only with political issues but also with matters that crossed sectors, senior soldiers had charge of the day-to-day security and running of their particular sector of the territory. Riley took care of overall assignments, making certain the dominants in the den functioned as a smooth unit, but Elias was the one who handled issues specific to the senior soldiers. And it was his advice Riley asked when the lieutenant wanted to know how best to utilize those men and women.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Elias now said, \u201cfirst thing we have to do is hash out assignments during the mating ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Adria knew everyone would want a chance to attend the celebration, but the pack\u2019s territory couldn\u2019t be left undefended. \u201cOne-hour rotating shifts?\u201d she suggested from her seat on a sofa beside dark-eyed Simran. \u201cWe have enough people even without the lieutenants.\u201d Indigo, Riaz, Judd, and Riley would need to remain at the Pack Circle.</p><p>Kieran linked his hands behind his head and leaned back, balancing his chair precariously on two legs. \u201cWorks for me.\u201d The smooth brown of his skin gleamed with health. \u201cBut anyone on the inner perimeter will have to do a two-hour block\u2014have to allow travel time. Outer perimeter\u2019s going to be a problem. It\u2019s too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCats have agreed to cover it.\u201d Elias shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t know when we stopped trying to skin them for their pelts and started to trust them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShame, I could\u2019ve used a new rug,\u201d some wit commented from the back.</p><p>Adria grinned. Like the others, her own wolf was still getting used to an alliance that had gone beyond blood and to the heart. For a pack like SnowDancer to trust its borders to anyone, much less a leopard pack strong enough to be a threat, spoke of ties so deep, nothing would fracture them.</p><p>The change hadn\u2019t happened overnight. It had taken years ... years while she\u2019d been trapped in amber, driven by a painful hope that had died a slow, cruel death. But, she thought, never would she have to look back and wonder if she\u2019d given up too soon. No, she\u2019d tried. Until her heart broke.</p><p>\u201cBack to the shifts,\u201d Eli said, deep brown hair the shade of burnt toffee sliding across his forehead. \u201cAnyone who takes the inner perimeter only has to do a single shift for the night, so if you want one of those, let me know.\u201d</p><p>There were a few raised hands, mostly from those who wanted to have the early part of the evening off so they could attend the ceremony with their children. \u201cAnd,\u201d one of them pointed out, \u201cit\u2019s not like the party\u2019s going to stop.\u201d</p><p>A round of laughter followed, deepening when Drew quipped something in his usual sly way. Adria had been surprised to see him at the first meeting she\u2019d attended, his place in the hierarchy was so mutable, but she supposed he was technically closest to the senior soldiers. Of course, Riley\u2019s brother and Indigo\u2019s mate had a way of being welcome anywhere he went\u2014she\u2019d spotted him with the mechanics the other day.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now that that\u2019s sorted,\u201d Elias said, glancing once again at the board on which he\u2019d scribbled his notes. \u201cWe need to talk about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Eli,\u201d Kieran interrupted, gray-green eyes wicked with mischief. \u201cIs that one of those scratch-and-write boards they use at elementary school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Unfazed, Elias continued to write on the pink slate. \u201cYou just noticed?\u201d</p><p>Adria laughed, wondering if Sakura had given the board to her father. From beside her, Simran said, \u201cI think it\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a girl,\u201d Kieran pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s pink. Manly men spit on pink.\u201d</p><p>Roundly booed by the females in the room, Kieran threw out his arms. \u201cHey, hey, I like girls.\u201d Pure charm. \u201cA lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d Elias said in his no-nonsense way, \u201cor we\u2019ll be here all day. Next thing we need to sort out are some new training modules. We now have a climber with Level 4 certification in the group, so she\u2019ll be doing a lesson tomorrow for those of you who climb like bears after hibernation.\u201d</p><p>It took Adria a second\u2014and Elias\u2019s amused look\u2014to realize she\u2019d been volunteered.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>\u201cWORKS FOR ME.\u201d Climbing had always been a huge joy for her\u2014to the point that Martin had once joked she must\u2019ve been a cat in a former life. It was in fact the one thing they\u2019d enjoyed doing together almost to the end. As if in facing the challenge of a mountain or a sheer cliff face, they\u2019d become partners once more rather than adversaries. \u201cI can handle the lesson on my own,\u201d she said, gently closing the lid on memories that had no place in her new life, \u201cbut I hear Drew\u2019s a good climber, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he is. Which is why he\u2019ll be running things with you.\u201d</p><p>Drew saluted her from across the room. She couldn\u2019t help but smile\u2014how could she do anything but love the man who adored the woman who was, in every way that mattered, her sister. \u201cLevel?\u201d she asked Elias.</p><p>\u201cBeginner to intermediate. We can\u2019t keep letting the cats show us up when it comes to climbing.\u201d</p><p>Several \u201cHell yeahs\u201d sounded from around the room.</p><p>Adria shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas about scrambling around in the trees like they do\u201d\u2014their bodies were just built differently\u2014\u201cbut I can get you to a competent level if we do the lessons once a week for, say, two months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d Elias glanced around. \u201cYou know if you need the course\u2014stick your name down so I can make sure you\u2019re not on shift at the time.\u201d</p><p>A lazy voice\u2014Brody\u2014drawled a question from the back. \u201cI\u2019d like to get in some advanced sniper training while things are quiet. Can you rope in Judd or Dorian?\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Elias made another note, then the group took care of a couple of other matters before breaking up. Drew walked over to discuss their joint task as the others ambled out. \u201cYou got time now to scout a location and talk about how we want to run the first session?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Walking out beside him, she grabbed an apple from the bowl by the door.</p><p>Drew\u2019d already taken a bite of his by the time she polished it on her shirt and bit in. The crunch was satisfying, the sweetness refreshing, the air outside the den a cool caress. As a partner, Drew was flexible and intelligent, and they had no problems mapping out a strategy for the lesson.</p><p>That lesson, when it rolled around the next afternoon, went down like a house on fire. Surrounded by her peers, dirty and dusty and sweaty, she felt a sense of absolute rightness. This was home.</p> <p>Nothing and no one was going to push her out.</p><p>SIENNA went to avoid Riordan\u2019s kick, but knew she\u2019d moved a fraction of an instant too late. She winced at the whack she was undoubtedly about to get to the ribs except ... nothing happened. Blinking, she realized he\u2019d pulled the kick. Nothing wrong with that\u2014she did it herself all the time in training, because the aim wasn\u2019t to beat your fellow combatants bloody, but to teach and test one another. The only problem was, Riordan should\u2019ve still tapped her hard enough that she\u2019d remember her error.</p><p>Something hot and dark and infuriated boiled in her blood. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d she demanded, halting the session.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He shoved a hand through his chocolate-dark curls.</p><p>\u201cThat excuse for a kick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou stopped us to critique me?\u201d He scowled. \u201cYou can do that after\u2014let\u2019s get back to it before I go gray.\u201d</p><p>Already stressed over the mating ceremony the following day, Sienna was not in the mood for male wolf bullshit. \u201cHow about I incinerate your hair so you don\u2019t have to worry about that?\u201d It just slipped out.</p><p>She waited for fear to fill eyes that had always looked at her with friendly affection, stomach curdling at her error\u2014she\u2019d playfully threatened Hawke with singed eyebrows, but had been so careful not to remind the rest of the pack of what she was. But instead of fear, all she got was an \u201caw shucks\u201d grin and a shrug. \u201cI figured you wouldn\u2019t want to be bruised for your big day tomorrow.\u201d Charming eyes, big and brown and guileless.</p><p>It almost made sense. Except now that she thought about it, she realized he\u2019d done the same thing during their last training session\u2014only he\u2019d been a bit more cunning about it, grazing her so she knew she\u2019d been \u201chit.\u201d However, in spite of his boyish charm, Riordan was a dominant. The more she pushed him to admit what he\u2019d been up to, the more intractable he\u2019d get. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said with a smile she hoped didn\u2019t betray her bloodthirsty mood. \u201cThanks. Ready?\u201d</p><p>He dropped back into the correct stance.</p><p>Not giving any warning, she went at him full tilt\u2014her foot connected hard with his ribs, her elbow with his jaw, her fist with his stomach. She did keep her blows away from his pretty face, since he had a date for the ceremony. However, when he blocked her moves but made no aggressive ones of his own, she narrowed her eyes and went to kick him upside the head, which, if it connected, would surely create a nice big black-and-blue bruise down one side of his face.</p> <p>\u201cFuck!\u201d Slamming up a hand, he gripped her ankle the instant before she would\u2019ve made contact with his skull and flung her away and to the ground, coming down on top of her an instant later, his much heavier body pinning hers facedown on the mat. \u201cYou trying to kill me?\u201d It was a growl.</p><p>Instead of replying and though he\u2019d knocked all the air out of her, she went to slam her head back into his face. He jerked out of the way with another brutal word, setting her free. Pressing up to take a seated position on the mat, she raised an eyebrow at Riordan when he gave her a distinctly wary look from where he sat on the other side. \u201cOh, sorry,\u201d she said with sweetness that would\u2019ve done a candy bar proud, \u201cwere we only pretending to train?\u201d</p><p>Another growl, this one harsh and from the chest. \u201cYou\u2019re my alpha\u2019s mate,\u201d he snapped out with a raw anger she\u2019d never before witnessed in him. \u201cMy wolf can\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>It knocked the air out of her all over again. She\u2019d been so focused on how packmates would feel about her now that they knew of the cold fire, she hadn\u2019t really considered the more direct effect of her relationship with Hawke\u2014especially since her closest friend, Evie, had been so easy about it. But the fact was, she wasn\u2019t just Sienna Lauren, novice soldier and Riordan\u2019s friend anymore. She was Sienna Lauren Snow, mate to the SnowDancer alpha.</p><p>Stunned by the far-reaching implications of Riordan\u2019s statement, it took her several long seconds to formulate her reply. \u201cAn alpha can be challenged,\u201d she said slowly, \u201cso lower-ranked soldiers can get aggressive toward him, and by extension, his mate.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, Riordan fell backward, until he lay flat on his back. \u201cDo you know what Hawke would do to me if I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if the injury happened in this context.\u201d No matter his protectiveness, Hawke would never get in the way of her development and growth as a soldier. He\u2019d taken her to the mat more than once when he thought she was getting lazy with her physical training\u2014not to mention, he was the one who\u2019d thrown her into that physical training in the first place.</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t or aren\u2019t able to grasp that,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll ask Indigo to make sure we\u2019re not partnered up again.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a threat, but the offer of a friend who understood his wolf\u2019s nature. \u201cNo harm, no foul.\u201d</p> <p>Riordan snapped up into a sitting position. \u201cYou\u2019re flicking me off because I don\u2019t want to hit you hard enough to bruise?\u201d Simmering fury.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying I can\u2019t get better if my partner treats me like fine china.\u201d Her enemies certainly wouldn\u2019t worry about hurting her when they came after her, and not all of them would use solely psychic methods. \u201cI need to be lethal in every way if I\u2019m going to survive Ming and the rest of the Council.\u201d</p><p>Riordan blew out a harsh breath. \u201cIt makes me so angry that you have to think about shit like that.\u201d</p><p>She was the one who shrugged this time. \u201cIt\u2019s part of life.\u201d The good things more than made up for the bad.</p><p>Getting to his feet, Riordan held out his hand, tugging her up when she accepted the offer. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll stop holding back. But Sin ... I\u2019m a wolf. It might get sketchy at times.\u201d A mock punch to her jaw. \u201cJust thump me around the head to set me straight.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was in her heart. \u201cDeal.\u201d</p><p>Later that night, when Hawke got into bed after a long comm meeting, she snuggled into the wild heat of him and told him of her confrontation with Riordan. \u201cHe was much better after, even pulled me up on a couple of mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Hawke folded one arm under his head, the other around her, his fingers tracing curving patterns on her lower back. \u201cI was expecting some of that\u2014you\u2019re the only one who can deal with it.\u201d</p><p>Because the instant he stepped in, he negated her power. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, running her foot over his shin, \u201cfor loving me enough to let me fight my own battles.\u201d</p><p>He fisted his hand in her hair. \u201cNo\u2014some I\u2019m claiming as my right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. As long as you don\u2019t get greedy and try to handle them all.\u201d Sensing his surprise, she braced herself on one elbow and looked down into the incredible beauty of his night-glow eyes, the translucent blue lit with white fire. \u201cGorgeous wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the way you pet me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore,\u201d she said, stroking her fingers down his chest in a caress that pleasured them both, \u201cI used to fight you all the time because it felt as if you didn\u2019t trust me to do anything, as if I had to force you to see me.\u201d She pressed her fingers to his lips when he scowled, went to speak. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if it was true or not\u2014that\u2019s how I felt.</p><p>\u201cNow I know different ... so I can give in sometimes.\u201d Such conscious surrender wouldn\u2019t change his wolf\u2019s respect for her, wouldn\u2019t make him think her any less. It would simply let that wolf know she trusted him with her vulnerability\u2014and that was as important as her own pride.</p><p>Hawke moved with quicksilver grace to press her to her back, his muscled thigh pushing between her own, his hand still clenched in her hair. His kiss, when it came, was a hotly tender thing. \u201cSo strong, my Sienna, so beautiful.\u201d His mouth, wet and possessive down the line of her throat, making her body arch toward him. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said in a rumbling echo of her own words, \u201cfor loving me enough to understand my need to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh ... Lie back and think of England.\u201d</p><p>Laughter reawakened inside of her, bubbling its way past the raw burn of emotion. \u201cI\u2019d rather think of you.\u201d</p><p>She felt his smile against the curve of her abdomen, his jaw rough with stubble that made her shiver as he kissed his way oh-so-slowly down her body.</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>THE DAY OF Hawke and Sienna\u2019s mating ceremony dawned bright and clear. Though Adria had done an evening shift, she was up and awake by ten, ready to pitch in with the final preparations. Nell, the maternal female in charge, assigned her to grunt work in the kitchens. Adria was perfectly happy with that\u2014she liked working with her hands, even if it was only to peel two thousand potatoes.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d A broad-shouldered man with dark hair and tanned skin pulled up a stool across from her, his smile wide, the dimple in his left cheek giving him a roguish air. \u201cI\u2019ve been sent to join the foot soldiers.\u201d He held up a peeler. \u201cName\u2019s Sam. You\u2019re Adria, right?\u201d</p><p>It was impossible not to smile back. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know Indigo had another sister.\u201d</p><p>The mistake was an easy one to make if you didn\u2019t know the family well. \u201cTarah\u2019s my sister,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m technically Indigo\u2019s aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d Lines between his eyebrows. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her wolf was at once amused and delighted. \u201cScout\u2019s honor.\u201d Her parents had been\u2014according to her mother\u2014\u201cdeliriously ecstatic\u201d at their surprise pregnancy soon after they\u2019d celebrated the mating of their eldest child.</p><p>Indigo had been born a mere four years later.</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d A long pause as they peeled. \u201cSo, you have a date for the mating ceremony?\u201d</p><p>It felt good to be flirted with, to exercise her own rusty flirtation skills. \u201cAre you telling me you\u2019re not taken?\u201d</p> <p>A shrug. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make anyone jealous, so I was going to go stag, but now...\u201d A look so charming it could\u2019ve come from a feline. Impressive, given that Sam was human.</p><p>She almost said yes\u2014he was adorable and sexy and frank about his attraction to her. But ... he was so innocent. In his late twenties and clearly both tough and courageous from what she\u2019d seen of his actions on the battlefield, but not even a little hard. Though the actual age gap between them was likely to be five or six years, she felt ancient in comparison. \u201cI\u2019m not good for you, Sam.\u201d</p><p>His smile faded at her quiet words, his brown eyes velvet soft and intent. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m good for you, hmm?\u201d He peeled another potato, as if waiting for her to say something else. When she didn\u2019t, he issued a dramatic sigh. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll accept defeat\u2014on one condition.\u201d</p><p>God, but she liked him. \u201cDoesn\u2019t sound much like accepting defeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a SnowDancer.\u201d A sinful grin. \u201cPromise you\u2019ll dance as many dances with me as I want.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust dancing,\u201d she said, pinning him with a grim stare. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to Sam to permit him to think it might progress any further\u2014not when her wolf remained fixated on another man. The painful, unwanted desire was something she\u2019d conquer, but she would not hurt anyone else along the way.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Sam\u2019s suspiciously meek agreement was followed by a smug smile.</p><p>Adorable, she thought again, knowing he\u2019d definitely try to sneak a kiss if nothing else. \u201cSam.\u201d Laughter cancelled out her attempt to be stern. All at once, she felt light and young and carefree, something she\u2019d never again expected to feel.</p><p>Dimple appearing to dangerous effect, he touched her boot with his, playful as a pup. \u201cWe\u2019ll have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, her wolf padding happily inside her skin, \u201cI think we will.\u201d</p><p>RESTED and calmed by the time he\u2019d spent in San Diego before returning to the den on an early morning flight, with his parents and their charges to follow that afternoon, Riaz helped set up the sound system for the ceremony\u2014well, mostly he hefted things while the techs told him what to do. \u201cI think they\u2019re enjoying this a little too much,\u201d he said to Elias when he and the senior soldier paused for a water break.</p> <p>\u201cHow often do they get to give orders to a lieutenant?\u201d Elias grinned ... and almost tumbled forward when a small whirlwind attacked him from behind, wrapping her arms around his legs.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><p>Throwing his bottle of water toward Riaz, Elias reached back to grab Sakura, hauling her up into his arms. \u201cYou almost made me do a face-plant, baby girl.\u201d</p><p>Sakura giggled, her fine features painted with the well-known markings of a fictional warrior princess. \u201cNeal was chasing me.\u201d She peered over his shoulder. \u201cThere he comes!\u201d Wriggling out of her father\u2019s hold, she took off around the corner, arms and legs pumping with a strength that belied her thin frame.</p><p>A boy her age streaked by a moment later, a fluorescent green water bomb held in hand.</p><p>Wolf stretching in amusement, Riaz returned Elias\u2019s water bottle. \u201cLooks like the kids have started the party early.\u201d</p><p>Instead of replying in kind, the senior soldier stared after where the children had disappeared, his expression pensive.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Riaz said, thinking Eli was worried the boy would hurt Sakura. \u201cDrew checked the water bombs. They don\u2019t hit with any kind of impact\u2014it\u2019s just about getting the other person wet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Oh.\u201d Elias shook his head, shoving a hand through his sweat-damp hair. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not that.\u201d A pause as he drank. \u201cThing is ... I haven\u2019t seen that smile on her face since before the burns.\u201d</p><p>Hit by laser fire in an unprovoked Pure Psy attack, Elias had suffered injuries so severe, he\u2019d been in shock by the time they got him to the infirmary. Little Sakura had been disconsolate\u2014she was the apple of her daddy\u2019s eye, her sadness all the more poignant for being so silent. She\u2019d been this big-eyed, shocked waif it had broken the pack\u2019s heart to see.</p><p>Riaz knew both Eli and his mate, Yuki, continued to worry about the long-term impact of the trauma on their child. \u201cIt\u2019ll take time,\u201d he said, his mind on another child, another father, \u201cbut she\u2019ll get over it. Kids are tougher than adults think.\u201d</p><p>Elias met his gaze. \u201cYou sound certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad was badly hurt in the fighting when Garrick died.\u201d His teacher father had known he had no chance against the dominants who had turned, but he\u2019d stood firm in defense of the innocent. \u201cIt really shook me.\u201d He didn\u2019t like thinking about it, even now. \u201cBecause dads aren\u2019t supposed to get hurt, you know? Best thing my parents did was to not baby or coddle me or my brother afterward\u2014the normalcy helped us settle down.\u201d And even as a boy, he\u2019d known that he was lucky, so lucky.</p><p>Riley had lost his parents.</p><p>Hawke had lost his father ... and not long afterward, his mother.</p><p>So many other friends had been made orphans or been left with only one parent.</p><p>\u201cJust love her,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all she needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never forget what the den was like back then, after everything was over.\u201d Chill shadows whispered into the warmth of Eli\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow eerie, how quiet. So many of the strong were dead. I was a novice at the time, and terrified the pack was going to shatter around us.\u201d</p><p>But SnowDancer hadn\u2019t broken. It had grown stronger. Until tonight they celebrated the mating of the boy who had given up his childhood to lead the pack out of the darkness. Nothing and no one, Riaz thought, his own wolf fierce in its loyalty, would ever sway the pack\u2019s devotion to Hawke. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said to Eli, \u201cthe megalomaniacs called the techs are gesturing for us to hurry up.\u201d</p><p>It was two hours later that the other man said, \u201cDone! Don\u2019t know about you, but I could do with a beer.\u201d</p><p>Picking up the T-shirt he\u2019d stripped off earlier, Riaz used it to wipe his face as he nodded. He draped the T-shirt around his neck as they left the Pack Circle, and wasn\u2019t really paying attention when a group of female packmates walked past, carrying small boxes loaded up with decorations.</p><p>Until a wolf whistle pierced the quiet.</p><p>Glancing back, he found himself being observed by a sexy dark-eyed beauty with curly blonde hair to the middle of her back. She cocked the box on her hip, her full breasts pushing against the cotton of her navy blue tee, her smile an invitation. Most hot-blooded males would\u2019ve closed the distance between them to accept it, but Riaz shook his head with a gentle smile to soften the rejection, and continued on his way.</p><p>Elias didn\u2019t say anything until they\u2019d passed out of the heavily forested area immediately around the Pack Circle, and to an otherwise empty section of track. \u201cYou already have a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot interested.\u201d His wolf peeled back its lips in a snarl that exposed razor-sharp canines\u2014because the words were a lie. There was one woman who interested him a whole damn lot.</p><p>A short pause. \u201cDo you ... er ... swing the other way?\u201d</p><p>Riaz halted, stared. \u201cWhat the hell, Eli?\u201d</p><p>Elias shrugged, unabashed. \u201cWord is, the women are starting to wonder why you keep turning them down when it\u2019s obvious you need to share skin privileges. And don\u2019t shoot me, but Lara\u2019s apparently been asked a few pointed questions, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Riaz gripped the ends of his T-shirt, twisted. \u201cMy cock is fixated on a woman who makes my blood boil\u201d\u2014a fixation that kept shoving Lisette into the background\u2014\u201cand the pack thinks I\u2019m either gay or incapable.\u201d He didn\u2019t know whether to roar his aggravation or break something.</p><p>\u201cThe one you want\u201d\u2014unhidden curiosity\u2014\u201cshe in the den?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t allow it to, regardless of the fact that he\u2019d woken up with a hard-on as rigid as stone this morning, his mind filled with the husky voice and erotic taste of the woman he\u2019d almost fucked against the cold metal of a car door.</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d Elias\u2019s genial words broke into the teeth-clenched intensity of his thoughts. \u201cThough you should know\u2014I have a feeling a number of the single women are planning to ambush you tonight and get an answer once and for all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve seen that coming.\u201d He was a strong, eligible male without a partner. It would\u2019ve been more surprising if he hadn\u2019t been playfully stalked. He was also dominant enough to scare them all away, but just because he was in a shit of a mood didn\u2019t mean he wanted to ruin the night for women who were only behaving as their natures dictated. \u201cWhy the hell did I come back to the den?\u201d It was a snarl.</p><p>Elias slapped him on the back. \u201cYou know you love us.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, he did. So he\u2019d swallow his irritation and frustration, and dance every dance if it came down to it\u2014each with a different partner, so no one would get ideas about staking a claim.</p><p>The one woman he would not be dancing with was Adria.</p><p>It shamed him to the core, destroying everything he thought he knew about himself, but he wasn\u2019t sure he could touch her without shoving her to the earth and ripping off her panties to thrust himself into the scalding tightness of her body.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>HAWKE CAUGHT AN unexpected scent on the breeze when he stepped outside with Judd, wanting to get some fresh air after the comm-conference they\u2019d just had with Lucas, Sascha, Nikita, Max, and Anthony. It was the second time in a week they\u2019d all connected, unusual for their strange alliance, but necessary given the growing volatility of the PsyNet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It had become dangerous enough that both Nikita and Anthony had made contingency plans in case of their own assassinations. For the first time, he\u2019d found himself feeling a reluctant respect for the former Councilors\u2014the two had considered the impact of their deaths not only on their business empires but also on the people who counted on them for stability. He wasn\u2019t ever going to trust or like either, not when he knew how much blood they had on their hands, but he\u2019d accepted the need to work with this particular enemy to protect SnowDancer and the region.</p><p>Not a scenario he\u2019d have anticipated even a year ago, but he wasn\u2019t going to think further on it today. This night, it was about his mate and his pack. About wolves and play. Laughter and affection.</p><p>That scent again.</p> <p>\u201cIs Alexei here?\u201d His youngest lieutenant had wanted to attend the ceremony, but Hawke had nixed the request. While none of the sectors outside den territory had as yet been targeted, SnowDancer couldn\u2019t risk reducing security in those regions\u2014and it wasn\u2019t only the Psy they had to worry about. Alexei\u2019s sector was on the very edge, near the border with Oregon, close to the lands of a much smaller but aggressive wolf pack.</p><p>Judd gave him an inscrutable look. \u201cHe\u2019s not scheduled to arrive for at least another month. We discussed it at the last lieutenant meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I could swear...\u201d Shaking his head, he shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cWhere\u2019d Riley say he\u2019d meet us?\u201d</p><p>Judd nodded at the water glinting through the trees, the sun fracturing it in bright splashes of silver and cobalt. \u201cIn the clearing on the other side of the lake. Said he wanted some time out from the insanity inside.\u201d</p><p>Wolf not happy with its mistake about the scent, but willing to let it go, he continued to walk beside his lieutenant\u2014a man who, as a result of his incredible feats during the battle in San Francisco, now had a fan club. Complete with \u201cI Judd\u201d and \u201cJudd Is My Boyfriend\u201d memorabilia.</p> <p>In the normal course of events, civilians wouldn\u2019t have gotten anywhere near the former Arrow, but it had been impossible to evacuate the entire city prior to the Pure Psy attack. His name, at least, should have remained under wraps, but a number of intrepid journalists had risked life and limb to cover the battle\u2014and one of them had overheard the other fighters calling out to Judd, revealed it in the ensuing article. \u201cDid Brenna show you the website?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A dark mutter.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf huffed in laughter, thinking of the secret stash of \u201cI Judd\u201d T-shirts and buttons Drew had purchased for everyone to wear at the next lieutenant meeting. \u201cI\u2019m thinking of making you my new PR person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate to turn my niece into a widow so soon,\u201d was the cool answer.</p><p>\u201cI hear women are posting their phone numbers on the site for you.\u201d Accompanied by sexy videos and photos.</p><p>Judd\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cNot after Brenna hacked the site and plastered a message on their homepage pointing out that I\u2019m very happily mated to a wolf with sharp teeth, razored claws, and a wild case of insane jealousy.\u201d A small smile that was nonetheless, quietly satisfied. \u201cShe also uploaded several gruesome photos of feral wolf kills.\u201d</p> <p>Hawke grinned in pride\u2014he\u2019d expected nothing less. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d Catching another scent, he halted. \u201cDamn it, that was Matthias.\u201d</p><p>Judd watched him without blinking, the perfect expressionless Arrow. \u201cDid you get enough sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny.\u201d Growling low in his throat, he picked up his speed. \u201cJem. Kenji. Cooper\u2014\u201d And suddenly, he was in a clearing filled with his lieutenants, male and female, from the youngest to the most experienced, from every sector across SnowDancer\u2019s massive territory.</p><p>A \u201cwhoop\u201d went up at his entrance, and then he was being hugged, and slapped on the back, and even kissed. \u201cI\u2019d have hit that beautiful mouth,\u201d a grinning Jem said, touching the cheek to which she\u2019d pressed her lips, \u201cbut I hear your mate is a possessive woman.\u201d</p><p>He was not in the mood to laugh. \u201cWhat the hell are you all doing here?\u201d Never had his men and women so blatantly disobeyed his orders.</p><p>\u201cRelax, boss,\u201d Tom\u00e1s said with his usual irreverence. \u201cWe came down using our best sneaking skills to duck under the radar\u2014no one\u2019s going to miss us for one night. Every one of us has people we trust holding the fort and\u201d\u2014he held up a sat phone\u2014\u201cwe\u2019re in constant contact with our sectors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith,\u201d Riaz added, holding up his own sat phone, \u201cJudd, Riley, Indigo, and me acting as double backups in case of an emergency.\u201d</p><p>Hawke glanced at Riley. \u201cI assume WindHaven is flying patrols over the territory?\u201d His lieutenants were too smart not to use every resource available to them.</p> <p>\u201cI told you he\u2019d figure it out.\u201d Alexei smiled that \u201csupermodel\u201d smile of his\u2014as once described by Tom\u00e1s ... right before Alexei gave him a black eye. \u201cWe had to be here. You can yell at us and kick us out, but we\u2019ll just shrug and turn right back around.\u201d</p><p>Kenji, his hair dyed a deep purple and sprayed with tiny gold stars, nodded. \u201cWe\u2019re like termites\u2014you can\u2019t get rid of us.\u201d</p><p>He was alpha, his word law. He also knew when he was beaten.</p><p>Wrapping an arm around Jem\u2019s petite form, he squeezed her to his side, his wolf nuzzling at her own in welcome. To have the loyalty of men and women of such strength and heart was a gift\u2014even if it meant he had to face the occasional challenge to his authority. And this particular challenge ... it showed a depth of love any alpha would be hard-pressed to repudiate. \u201cI guess we\u2019d better find somewhere for you lot to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Cooper snorted, the smooth mahogany of his skin bisected by a jagged scar on the left-hand side of his face. \u201cWho plans to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d Tom\u00e1s\u2019s grin was infectious. \u201cI intend to dance till dawn, hopefully with the sexy little wolf I spied earlier, then sneak home before anyone knows I was even gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the single women are wise to you, mi amigo,\u201d Matthias drawled with a grin, one arm around Indigo where she leaned against his muscular bulk. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m sure the grandmothers will appreciate the company.\u201d</p><p>Turning toward the big lieutenant, Tom\u00e1s shook his head, his expression mock solicitous. \u201cI\u2019d be careful if I were you\u2014Drew might deck you again if he hears you\u2019ve been touching his Indy here. Didn\u2019t he whip your sorry ass the last time?\u201d</p><p>Indigo patted Matthias\u2019s arm. \u201cThey\u2019ve made up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there kissing?\u201d Tom\u00e1s asked, clapping his hands to his chest. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t invite\u2014\u201d</p><p>Having strolled over, Jem grabbed his face between her hands and laid one on him. \u201cThere you go, Tommy.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time Hawke had seen Tom\u00e1s speechless. Everyone else cracked up.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf bared its teeth in a happy grin\u2014it had been years since alpha and lieutenants had all been in one place at one time, and damn but it felt good. He knew it would be good for the pack as well, a quiet declaration that SnowDancer wasn\u2019t scared or cowed by its enemies into running and hiding.</p><p>They were wolf. And they were strong.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>COUNCILOR KALEB KRYCHEK dropped out of the PsyNet and back into his physical body where he stood on the edge of the balcony of his home on the outskirts of Moscow. That balcony had no railing, and the gorge below, swathed in the dark veil of night on this side of the world, was sheer, signaling death for anything that couldn\u2019t fly ... or teleport.</p><p>His lashes came down, swept back up.</p><p>His ability to teleport to individuals meant nothing, not in this particular situation. For some reason, he could not teleport to the one person he\u2019d spent years learning to know, to understand. Opening his psychic eye again, he considered the pathways he\u2019d already traversed. He was getting closer, that much was inarguable. The only question was whether he\u2019d be fast enough to\u2014</p><p>Councilor.</p><p>Shifting his focus at the telepathic hail, he slipped back into his mind and out again onto the PsyNet, this time devoid of the shields that made him invisible. \u201cSilver.\u201d</p><p>His aide\u2019s mind was crystal clear, with none of the hairline cracks that signaled broken or compromised conditioning. \u201cSir,\u201d she said. \u201cMy family did not lose its contact inside Pure Psy in the fight against the changelings, and his most recent communiqu\u00e9 makes it clear the group is stirring again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assumed as much.\u201d Pure Psy had been heavily damaged but not destroyed by the cold violence of Sienna Lauren\u2019s X-fire combined with a fierce fighting force of changelings, humans, and Psy.</p><p>An unusual mix.</p><p>Kaleb had watched from a distance, weighing up what the group effort meant for the future not simply of his own race but of the world.</p><p>\u201cTheir new goal?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cUnidentified. Information is being communicated to a select number of individuals on a need-to-know basis. The only fact our contact was able to confirm is that they\u2019ve shifted their attention from the changelings to the Net.\u201d</p><p>Kaleb considered the radical change. After the decisive defeat Pure Psy had suffered, it made sense for the group to rethink its objectives, but it had to be more than that. Fanatics did not think in a logical fashion, and Pure Psy was a construction of absolute fanaticism, no matter what its adherents told themselves about the \u201cPurity\u201d of their Silence.</p><p>More than likely, the Pure Psy membership had decided that anyone who had not supported the group\u2019s attack on the changelings was to be treated as the enemy, including those of their own race. \u201cThank you, Silver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir.\u201d Her roaming presence streaked away, a shooting star.</p><p>Kaleb stared out at the gorge on the physical plane, but on the psychic, he was reaching for the DarkMind.

What do you see? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The broken, twisted neosentience, created of all the emotions the Psy refused to acknowledge, much less feel, twined around him, a pet seeking affection. Except it was no pet but a nightmare, and Kaleb didn\u2019t understand the concept of affection. Still, he could mimic it enough to calm the DarkMind.</p><p>The neosentience showed him minds disrupted, areas of the Net disturbed, but Kaleb had seen that for himself, monitored Subject 8-91 on a continuous basis. Pure Psy, he said, narrowing the search parameters.</p><p>The DarkMind had nothing new to show him on the topic.</p> <p>So, Silver was righter than she knew\u2014Pure Psy was keeping all information about its new plans under a mental and psychic lockdown. That meant its members had to be limiting their communications to telepathy or in-person meetings. Slow ... but an excellent safeguard to ensure no one would uncover their objective until it was too late.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>SIENNA LOOKED IN the mirror, startled by the woman who looked back at her.</p><p>Everything else new she\u2019d purchased over the past couple of years, she\u2019d acquired on shopping expeditions with friends. But not the dress she wore today. Hauntingly aware that this night when she made a public claim on her wolf, was claimed in turn, would resonate in her soul for the rest of her life, she\u2019d needed it to be a private thing.</p><p>She\u2019d picked the design on her own, sourced the emerald green fabric, cut out the pattern using the template, then asked Tarah to sew it for her. The result was breathtaking. Made of a silky material that caressed rather than clung, it had straps that crossed her upper chest before curving around her neck in a halter, and a graceful, flowing skirt that kissed her ankles. Supremely elegant\u2014but for the hidden slit on one side that hit mid-thigh, and appeared only if she moved a certain way.</p> <p>It made her feel young and sexy, beautiful and graceful, at the same time.</p><p>For her feet, she\u2019d chosen not respectable heels, but the very unrespectable thigh-high boots she\u2019d worn the night Hawke had carried her out of Wild. That was the night they\u2019d danced their first dance, a dance she would never forget.</p><p>Her hair she\u2019d left down, because her wolf preferred it that way.</p><p>That wolf now growled. \u201cCome here so I can take a bite.\u201d</p><p>Her thighs clenched. \u201cBehave.\u201d He looked gorgeous in a formal black shirt and pants, his hair and eyes thrown into startling relief, but she had another outfit in mind. \u201cI bought you a present.\u201d</p><p>A slow wolfish smile. \u201cI have one for you, too.\u201d Closing the small distance between them, he made her hold out her hand, palm open.</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said in delight, \u201cwhich one did you get?\u201d The intricate toys he\u2019d given her during their courtship were some of her most cherished keepsakes.</p><p>When he put the old-fashioned mechanical toy on her palm, she stopped breathing. It was a tiny representation of an atom, complete with colored ball bearings standing in for neutrons, protons, and on the outside, arranged on arcs of fine wire, electrons. Turning the key on the side made the electrons move, what she\u2019d thought were ball bearings actually finely crafted spheres of glass that sparked with color.</p><p>A brilliant, thoughtful, wonderful gift for a physics major.</p><p>Eyes burning, she swallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect.\u201d It still shook her at times, how he remembered things that mattered to her\u2014even when she didn\u2019t think he was paying attention. The other day, a book had appeared on her reader that she\u2019d only mentioned wanting in passing.</p><p>He rubbed his knuckles over her cheek, as if he understood exactly what his care meant to her ... then she realized he did. The mating bond connected them on a level that was as primal as the heart of the wolf.</p><p>\u201cWhy magnesium?\u201d she asked, identifying the atomic number of the light metal.</p><p>His hand on her jaw, his mouth on her own. \u201cBecause it\u2019s beautifully explosive, just like my X.\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat. \u201cI like the way you pet me, too.\u201d The way he made her feel as if her cold fire was a gift, not a curse.</p> <p>Placing his gift on the vanity when the clockwork mechanism wound down, she reached for the box she\u2019d laid on the seat in front of it. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d Nerves knotted her stomach. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s okay,\u201d she said as he pulled off the ribbon with male impatience and opened the lid to reveal the contents.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cI can send it back, reorder another\u2014\u201d His kiss stole her breath, stole her words, would\u2019ve stolen her heart if it hadn\u2019t already belonged to him.</p><p>Touching her fingers to her passion-swollen lips, her breasts straining against the bodice of her dress, she watched him put the box back on the seat and strip off his shirt, exposing the beautiful chest she\u2019d licked and sucked in the shower not long ago\u2014her mate could be patient now that \u201cthe edge was off,\u201d though patience was a relative thing.</p><p>She\u2019d ended up pinned to the wet tile, her legs wrapped around lean hips. Petting her with lazy possessiveness, he\u2019d stroked into her slow and deep until she came in a rain of pleasure. Yet her body pulsed for him all over again, the sensory memory of rubbing against his chest sensitizing her nipples to aching points.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s nostrils flared, but he didn\u2019t stop what he was doing.</p><p>Dropping his shirt onto the bed, he lifted out and shrugged into the one she\u2019d spent hours upon hours searching for online. When he raised his hands to the buttons, she stepped into his space. \u201cI\u2019ll do that.\u201d She couldn\u2019t resist kissing each hard, muscled inch before she covered it up.</p><p>\u201cSienna.\u201d</p><p>A shiver rippled over her skin at the sound of that deep growly voice. \u201cWe can\u2019t be late to our own ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Tugging back her head, he nipped at her lower lip, his eyes wolf blue. \u201cI\u2019ll put it on your tab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll put it on yours,\u201d she said, giving him a little bite with her \u201cclaws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to pay up.\u201d His free hand, proprietary and warm, on the curve of her hip. \u201cWith interest.\u201d</p><p>Slotting in the final button, she resisted the urge to undo her work and stepped back to watch him tuck the shirt into his pants and do up his belt. There was something intensely erotic about seeing her man getting dressed, and Sienna had the feeling that would never change. Not with Hawke.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d he said afterward.</p><p>She straightened the collar. \u201cTake it off, you\u2019re too handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s already my favorite shirt.\u201d Hawke remembered seeing Lucas in a T-shirt that exactly matched his eyes not long ago, and feeling the hard stab of envy at knowing the leopard alpha\u2019s mate had purchased it for him. He\u2019d thought the wild beauty of such a bond forever out of his reach.</p><p>Now, he was being petted by a woman who had somehow managed to find a shirt that matched the unusual shade of his own eyes, the ice blue threads so fine, it felt like wearing a kiss against his skin. Sienna\u2019s kiss. \u201cWhat are you buying me for my birthday?\u201d Both parts of him admired his reflection, his hair almost glittering against the foil of the blue.</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if I told you,\u201d was the arch response.</p><p>Delighted with her, he stole another kiss before tangling his fingers with her own. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The slightest hitch to her breath. \u201cI know these events follow their own rhythm, but do you have any idea of what we should expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood chance the lieutenants are going to kick it off with a speech.\u201d Hawke glanced down, glimpsed the black leather-synth of her boot through the slit, and remembered that hushed night when he\u2019d first allowed himself to hold her, though it had been torture to do only that and nothing more. \u201cThen we\u2019ll dance and celebrate.\u201d Normally, Hawke would be the one who spoke first at any mating or bonding ceremony, letting the new couple know their pairing was accepted and welcome. The impact of that moment was luminous, an inexplicable but powerful something passing between an alpha and his people.</p><p>\u201cDance all night with me?\u201d Sienna asked as they left the den for the walk to the Pack Circle.</p><p>He enjoyed the feel of the wind flicking her dress against his legs, the supple warmth of her a familiar caress under the hand he\u2019d placed on her lower back. \u201cI know Tom\u00e1s is planning to steal a dance, and Drew\u2019s claimed one already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re rescinding the no-touching rule for tonight?\u201d It was a laughing tease.</p><p>\u201cSince there are no baby cats around, yes.\u201d His wolf snarled at the reminder of her friendship with Kit. \u201cBut, on that note\u2014\u201d Not giving her any warning, he bit her on the bared skin of her right shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHawke!\u201d She thrust a hand into his hair, found that instead of pushing him away, she was holding him to her while he licked over the mark with a molten sensuality that made her toes curl.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he murmured, slits of ice blue visible between lowered lids. \u201cNow everyone knows you\u2019re mine.\u201d Another proprietary lick.</p><p>Pulse thudding against her skin, she laughed. \u201cAs if people were in any doubt.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied\u2014and very alpha\u2014smile on his face, he placed his hand on her lower back again and they continued down the path. \u201cI\u2019ll allow the pack to monopolize you until midnight\u201d\u2014a low murmur that was a rough stroke over her skin\u2014\u201cthen I\u2019ll dance with you until the stars fade and the sun rises.\u201d</p><p>Heart shattering at the beauty of her mate\u2019s promise, she entered the Pack Circle with him.</p><p>The cheer that split the air was deafening. Grinning, Hawke led her to where his lieutenants waited in front of a crowd that included every member of the den\u2019s population, except for the few on security rotation.</p><p>Matthias raised his arms to get the pack to quiet down, but gave up the floor to Riley once he had the crowd\u2019s attention. Hawke\u2019s most senior lieutenant stepped forward and, cupping Sienna\u2019s face in his hands, said a single simple word, \u201cWelcome.\u201d</p><p>The howl that went up in the clearing was multiharmonic and piercingly joyful, a song that was a gift. Linked as he was to Sienna, Hawke felt her stunned wonder and knew she didn\u2019t realize the significance of the act. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re welcoming you,\u201d he whispered, his chest vibrating with the need to add his voice to the song, \u201cnot as my mate, but as their alpha\u2019s mate.\u201d The distinction was important, and when untrammeled sunshine lit up her face, he knew she understood.</p><p>A rustle of giggling and whispering sounded on the last echo of the harmony, and suddenly, they were faced with the pups. Tarah stood unobtrusively to the side, where the youngest ones could see her. A graceful wave of her hand and the children began to sing, their voices high and sweet and full of innocence fragile as glass.</p><p>He saw from the surprise on Riley\u2019s face that the kids had managed to keep this a secret. His wolf\u2019s heart burst in pride. Tucking Sienna\u2019s hand to his side, he glanced down to see an iridescent shimmer over the night-sky of her gaze. Her cousin, Marlee, was among the singers, as was her brother, Toby\u2014still young enough to not mind joining the children, but old and lanky enough that he\u2019d had to find a space right at the back. He held a chubby two-year-old in his arms, her singing enthusiastic if not altogether coherent.</p> <p>It was on the final chorus that his mate surprised him, adding her voice with a playful grace that delighted the children. Afterward, hands linked, the pups took multiple giggling bows while thunderous applause filled the clearing. When a little girl escaped on sturdy legs to make a beeline for Hawke, he scooped her up and received a bright-eyed and somewhat sloppy kiss for his trouble.</p><p>Grinning, he passed her to her laughing father, her baby pink dress frothing over the man\u2019s sun-browned arm. \u201cThis one\u2019s going to give you trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the nursery flirt,\u201d the other man said, tapping at the pup\u2019s nose in loving reproof.</p><p>It was a far more elegant female who came forward next, her petite body sheathed in an ankle-length cheongsam of deep yellow silk, her glossy black hair in a neat twist. Nell represented not simply the maternals, but everyone in SnowDancer who didn\u2019t identify as a dominant. In her arms she held a beautiful handmade quilt, the craftsmanship exquisite. \u201cEach family in the den contributed a piece to this, thus each block is unique.\u201d She handed the precious gift to Sienna.</p><p>Reaching behind her to another one of the maternal females, Nell accepted what appeared to be an old-fashioned tapestry. \u201cWe created this from threads sent in by families across the territory.\u201d This, she put into Hawke\u2019s arms, pressing her lips to his cheek before turning to do the same to Sienna, the evocative brown of her uptilted eyes shimmering with affection. \u201cYou are loved, and you are ours.\u201d</p> <p>Handling the gifts with the care they deserved, Hawke and Sienna gave them into the gentle keeping of two of the elders who stood with them. A moment later, quiet, often reserved Alexei stepped forward and leaned in to kiss Sienna\u2019s cheek, one strong hand cupping her left shoulder. \u201cWelcome.\u201d The young lieutenant\u2019s hair glinted gold in the colored lights strung across the Pack Circle as he turned to Hawke and began swearing his fealty.</p><p>It was an unexpected development, but Hawke responded automatically, slicing his palm with the knife Tom\u00e1s threw him, so that a single drop of his blood splashed onto Alexei\u2019s open hand.</p><p>Sienna watched, calm as a mountain lake, but he could feel her tension along the mating bond. He\u2019d forgotten to explain to her\u2014because it had slipped his own mind\u2014that when an alpha mated, or bonded to a permanent partner, his lieutenants had to reaffirm their allegiance. It was a directive meant to protect the pack if an alpha chose a woman the pack couldn\u2019t trust or respect\u2014because even the most powerful wolf couldn\u2019t rule without the loyalty of his strongest packmates. In such a situation, the pack inevitably split, the old alpha leaving with his supporters.</p><p>It was a measure of Hawke\u2019s bond with his men and women that he hadn\u2019t even thought of the possibility of that outcome.</p><p>Alexei fisted his hand over the drop of blood and stepped back, the moment solemn ... until he winked at Sienna. Hawke felt her tension ease at once, right before she was picked up off her feet and kissed on the mouth by Matthias, her startled hands flying up to land on the arms of the lieutenant who was built like a tank.</p><p>Hawke growled. \u201cCareful.\u201d</p> <p>An unrepentant grin creasing the smooth dark of a face that had beguiled many a woman, Matthias put Sienna on her feet. \u201cHe ever chase you down a corridor again, sweetheart, you know who to call.\u201d</p><p>Sienna held her own. \u201cI think I rather enjoy being caught.\u201d</p><p>Then Matthias was in front of him, swearing his allegiance. And so it continued until all ten of his lieutenants had completed the task. Each oath was different, because there were no set words for this. It was only the meaning that mattered. The loyalty. A sigh of happiness rippled around the Pack Circle as Riley closed his hand over the drop of Hawke\u2019s blood.</p><p>It was done.</p><p>His pack had accepted both his mate and his mating. Not simply accepted, he thought when another multiharmonic howl went up, but celebrated. This time, he didn\u2019t resist, and drawing Sienna\u2019s back against his chest, threw back his own head to sing, his cut hand fisted tight to still the blood flow. Against him, he could feel his mate\u2019s body vibrating with the beauty of the music, the wildfire of her blinding along their bond.</p><p>When Tom\u00e1s grabbed her for a dance, Hawke didn\u2019t protest. Possessive though it was, his wolf understood that Sienna belonged to the pack, too, and that they\u2019d lay down their lives for her. It didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d have an easy road when it came to making her place in SnowDancer, but tonight, his wolves told her they knew she was the right mate for their alpha, regardless of her age and inexperience. They would stand by her as she grew into her strength.</p><p>It was a gift to Hawke\u2019s heart.</p><p>Chapter 18</p> <p>RILEY\u2019S SHOULDER NUDGED Hawke\u2019s, as in front of them, other couples joined in the dancing and Sienna was passed from Tom\u00e1s to Kenji. \u201cYou do realize you\u2019ll have to fight to get near her tonight?\u201d</p><p>Hawke glanced at his senior lieutenant to see Riley\u2019s eyes lingering on his own mate. Dressed in a graceful azure dress that hit a few inches above the knee and flared out when she spun, shiny black ankle boots on her feet, her red hair pulled off her face by two small combs, Mercy was currently dancing\u2014and laughing\u2014with Drew. She was the only leopard in attendance, because this was a private moment for the pack\u2014and as far as SnowDancer was concerned, Mercy was theirs. No matter how much Lucas might disagree.</p><p>Lips curving at the thought, he said, \u201cI promised my mate I\u2019d dance with her from midnight to dawn, and I don\u2019t break my promises.\u201d He\u2019d be patient until then, his wolf content with keeping an eye on her while she was claimed by SnowDancer on the deepest level.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared. What I did ... I\u2019m afraid no one will look at me the same again.\u201d</p><p>Words she\u2019d spoken after the violence of her ability had devoured the pack\u2019s enemies, and in one way, she was right. No one would ever again look at Sienna the same\u2014because now, each and every SnowDancer understood the lethal power that ran in her veins. Yet there was no fear in the air tonight, only the cold-eyed approbation of the predator that lived within their hearts.</p><p>Well aware how much the man at his side had done to ensure that, to make certain respect didn\u2019t turn to fear, he caught Riley\u2019s gaze. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need between us. Never has been.\u201d A pause, quiet humor in his next words. \u201cI seem to recall you allowing me to beat up on you once upon a time when I was courting Mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember you winning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have selective memory.\u201d</p><p>Wolf and man both laughed, happy to be here in this moment with his friend, his pack, and most of all, with the woman who sent him a secret smile from the far side of the clearing.</p><p>ADRIA smiled as she felt muscular arms slip around her waist from behind. \u201cI was wondering where you were,\u201d she said, her throat raw with emotion from the haunting simplicity and beauty of the mating ceremony.</p><p>Nuzzling at her, Sam kissed her jaw. \u201cCome, dance with me.\u201d</p><p>She slid into the play of bodies, his hand clasped around her own, and danced until her pulse was a drum, her blood running hot through her veins. Sam did try to steal a kiss, and bubbling with the wild joy of the night, she let him, but pressed her fingers over his lips when he tried again. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Undaunted, he spoke against her fingertips, dimple denting his cheek. \u201cWe\u2019d have fun. I have no hang-ups about your dominance if you\u2019re worried about that. I\u2019ll even let you bite.\u201d A rub, nose to nose. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019d like it if you did.\u201d</p><p>Playful and gorgeous and intelligent, he was a lover who\u2019d make her feel good, both physically and in the soul. There was only one problem\u2014her body hummed with a near-painful awareness of another man, a man who aroused far more violent, dark emotions. And who was currently twirling a tiny, curvy woman whose eyes were a golden echo of his, shouting their relationship, his cheeks creased in a true smile.</p><p>It infuriated her that she couldn\u2019t strangle that unwanted awareness, but she wouldn\u2019t use beautiful, sexy Sam in an effort to do so. \u201cI\u2019m not ready.\u201d One day, she thought, spine steely with determination, she would be ready to gather up her courage and take another chance, having conquered this unhealthy compulsion toward the wrong man. Sam, innocent and never broken, wasn\u2019t the right one, her heart too scarred for him, but that didn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t cherish him. \u201cI wish I was, because you\u2019re rather wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Stroking his hands down her back, he took the rebuff with good grace. \u201cIn that case, be my friend. I like you.\u201d</p><p>The direct opposite of the knife-edged words Riaz had flung at her, his statement made her miss a step before she cuddled a little closer into him. \u201cI like you, too.\u201d She turned her face deliberately away from the part of the Circle where Riaz stood with his arm around his recent dance partner and an older man Adria couldn\u2019t see well. Deep inside her, her wolf snarled, but that wolf, too, remembered how brutally it had been rejected. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It didn\u2019t fight Adria\u2019s decision.</p><p>RIAZ\u2019S eyes had locked on Adria the instant he\u2019d spotted her, the strange, unique complexity of her scent in his every breath, though it should\u2019ve been impossible to pick it up, given the number of people in the Circle. Especially when she was pasted up against Sam, the younger male\u2019s lips by her ear as he said something that made her laugh, the sound soft and intimate.</p><p>His claws pricked at his palms.</p> <p>Excusing himself from his parents after handing his mom back to his dad, he hauled Jem into a dance.</p><p>\u201cThanks for asking,\u201d she said in an acerbic tone, but slid her arms around his neck. \u201cStop scowling. Your mother is going to think I\u2019m torturing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Forcing himself to keep his attention away from Adria and Sam, he looked down at the blonde lieutenant ... and had the sudden realization that she didn\u2019t fit right in his arms. She was too small, her head reaching midway up his chest.</p><p>Jaw clenching at a thought that had its origins in his primal attraction toward a long-legged female whose voice was rough silk across his skin, he said, \u201cDid you dance with Kenji yet?\u201d The two had something going\u2014no one was quite sure what.</p><p>\u201cBite me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTemper, temper.\u201d He tucked her closer when she narrowed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll behave, promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I have \u2018sucker\u2019 written all over me?\u201d She went rigid a minute later.</p><p>Riaz understood why as soon as he saw Kenji appear out of the dancers.</p><p>\u201cCan I steal her away?\u201d The challenge in the other man\u2019s tone wasn\u2019t directed at Riaz.</p><p>All but able to touch the electricity in the air, Riaz stepped back, saw Kenji\u2019s arm slide around Jem\u2019s waist, and thought, Yeah, they fit.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, Garnet,\u201d Kenji said in a low tone, using Jem\u2019s real name, the purple and gold of his hair sliding forward to shadow his expression as he pulled her stiff body close.</p> <p>\u201cKenji\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a dance.\u201d</p><p>It was all Riaz heard before he found himself making his way to where Adria leaned against a tree on the other side of the clearing. The shadows of the forest concealed her from the crowd, until it was almost a private alcove ... but for the vivid tug of her scent.</p><p>Crushed berries in ice tangled with a hotter, deeper musk.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know why he halted only a foot from her, whatever he\u2019d wanted to say wiped from his mind by the jolt that rocked him at the single cool glance she deigned to throw his way. Conscious his eyes had fixated on the pulse in her neck, so delicate and bitable beneath creamy skin kissed with sunshine, he forced his attention back to the dancers.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s hair changed colors as he danced with Brenna under the multihued bulbs the juveniles had strung through the trees, until the entire area was a wonderland. Several of those juveniles sat in pairs or in small groups in the thick branches, watching the festivities and flirting. A kiss was sneaked here and there, but nobody made any move to leave. Perhaps because they were under notice from the maternals, but more likely because right now, it was about being with Pack.</p><p>His hand snapped out to grip Adria\u2019s arm almost before he was conscious of her getting ready to move. \u201cDance with me.\u201d It came out harsh, crushed rocks in his throat.</p><p>Adria wrenched away her arm, shuddering at the contact. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019d be a good idea.\u201d Riaz was a drug her body craved\u2014and like all addictive substances, he was not good for her.</p> <p>\u201cScared?\u201d Eyes gone night-glow.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, her own wolf rising to the fore. \u201cI just happen to have some self-respect.\u201d</p><p>Stepping out of the shadows, she saw Matthias walking toward her. Her mood shifted immediately. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you.\u201d</p><p>The big lieutenant lifted her up and kissed her on the lips as he\u2019d done Sienna. \u201cCome dance with me, pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf could feel the dark burn of another male\u2019s eyes between her shoulder blades, but she didn\u2019t hesitate to accept Matthias\u2019s offer. \u201cHow is everyone back in your sector?\u201d she asked once they\u2019d begun to sway to the music.</p><p>Mathias\u2019s chest rumbled as he spoke, his hand moving gently on her back. \u201cTicking along. We miss you\u2014do you plan to visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d Not yet. \u201cMaybe in a few more months...\u201d</p><p>Matthias\u2019s jaw brushed her hair. \u201cNo pressure, darling.\u201d They danced in warm silence until Adria caught a scent that made her spine lock\u2014right before Matthias said, \u201cI think someone\u2019s about to steal you away.\u201d</p><p>Not wanting to make a scene and mar the celebration, she didn\u2019t protest when Matthias stepped back. \u201cTake care of my girl,\u201d he warned.</p><p>Riaz muttered something pithy in Spanish that made Matthias laugh, but all Adria could hear as he took her into his arms was the frantic beat of her pulse, thudding in time to his own. Too fast, both of them, their skin too hot. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d she whispered, her voice stripped bare.</p><p>Riaz\u2019s answer sounded torn out of him. \u201cI can\u2019t stop myself.\u201d He shifted her closer, the move so unexpected, she didn\u2019t resist\u2014and found herself plastered to the hard strength of him. His arousal pushed into her abdomen, the hot male scent of him seeping into her veins until she could taste the dark forests and biting citrus of him against her tongue.</p><p>Breath coming in small pants, she shook her head, but the words she wanted to say wouldn\u2019t come, her brain hazed by need, such vicious need. When Riaz backed off, only to take her hand and tug her deep into the thick black of the trees, she knew she shouldn\u2019t go, but her feet kept moving forward, following him into the concealing shadows. The music continued to play behind them, but here, it was hushed and quiet.</p><p>Private.</p><p>Shoving her against a tree, he kicked her legs apart and suddenly his mouth was on her own, ravaging and taking and demanding. The civilized, rational part of her brain just stopped working. She gripped at his shoulders, her nails digging into heavy muscle as his tongue licked at her mouth, tangled with her own, the kiss an open, wet, voracious fury of contact.</p><p>Their gasped breaths were loud in the silence, their heartbeats thunder, and his hand when it closed over her breast, a shocking brand. Her cry swallowed by the rough demand of his mouth, she found herself rubbing up against him, trying to rise on tiptoe to create the perfect fit. Her frustration when she couldn\u2019t was shattered when his fingers squeezed her nipple through the silky material of her top, rolling and tugging. His hand dropped all too soon ... to slide under her top and spread on her abdomen, his fingers brushing the waistband of her sleekly tailored black pants.</p><p>His hand had touched her there once before.</p><p>A thread of reason broke through the blinding haze of passion, but his mouth was on her own again before it could penetrate, his free hand around her throat, and she was drowning. He was so big and strong, and he wanted her so desperately. It stroked the wolf\u2019s battered ego, made her claws prick out and dig into his flesh through the fine black cotton of his shirt.</p><p>He hissed out a breath, but it wasn\u2019t a sound that told her to stop. Instead, he kissed her harder, his fingers tugging open her fly to cup her possessively over the lace of her panties. Jerking, she felt herself grow even wetter, and from the growl that poured into her mouth, vibrating against her nipples, he felt it, too.</p><p>Then his fingers pushed aside the gusset of her panties and the thread of reason became a scream.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><p>Shoving him back with every ounce of her strength, she wrenched herself away from the tree. \u201cOh God, God.\u201d Her shaken gaze landed on his passion-fevered face, his cheekbones slicing against the dusky brown of his skin, his eyes a dangerous, brilliant gold.</p><p>Her wolf lunged toward him.</p><p>But she was human, too. Reining in the wolf with an iron grip, she somehow managed to do up her pants and tug down her pretty, silky black top hand-painted with a single stunning butterfly on the back. The material was thankfully immune to wrinkles, and her hair, it was still in place\u2014Riaz had been so focused on her mouth ... and lower.</p><p>Her lips felt swollen, but the apparent result of a few stolen kisses would catch no one\u2019s attention. As for the fact that she was covered in his scent\u2014she\u2019d just been dancing with him. All that went through her mind in a single split second as her sense of reason, of self, reawakened with a violent howl, her entire body quivering from the shock of halting an erotic dance that would\u2019ve had her pinned against the tree in another couple of minutes, her bare legs wrapped around his waist as he fucked her.</p><p>And that, she thought with grim honesty, was all it would\u2019ve been. Because whatever the cause of the rage she sensed in his kiss, Riaz, tall and strong and blood-loyal to SnowDancer, wasn\u2019t capable of anything else. Not with her. \u201cI\u2019m worth more,\u201d she told him, wiping the back of her hand across her mouth. \u201cAffection, respect, tenderness, I\u2019m worth all of that, so don\u2019t you dare come near me again until you\u2019re ready to offer it.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>RIAZ SHOVED SHAKING hands through his hair as Adria turned and walked away, her hips swaying in unintended provocation beneath the exquisite fit of her pants, the insubstantial silk of her top alternately floating and caressing her body. His hand flexed, the sensory echo of her so warm and responsive a mocking taunt.</p><p>Gritting his teeth against the urge to drag her back, he punched his fist into the tree where he\u2019d almost had her. He knew he could find another lover tonight. It wasn\u2019t simply that people were in a celebratory mood. As Eli had pointed out earlier, he\u2019d been offered a number of invitations since his return from Europe, and not all of those women wanted anything from him other than a good, hot tussle in bed.</p><p>There was just one problem\u2014he didn\u2019t want any other woman. He wanted the violet-eyed soldier who had, completely justifiably, told him to fuck off.</p><p>HIDDEN in the midnight shadows on the periphery of the large clearing, the Ghost watched the SnowDancers dance and laugh and play. Not ten feet from him, a giggling woman pressed her lover to a tree and suckled a kiss to the base of his neck before darting out of reach and back into the crowd. Groaning, the obviously disappointed male adjusted his jeans and followed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The Ghost didn\u2019t know why he watched. He\u2019d kept an eye on this region since before the battle with Pure Psy for reasons of his own, had dropped by tonight as part of a routine sweep, and caught the faint sound of music twining through the trees. It had taken him a significant investment of time to find this exact location\u2014he\u2019d never before ventured this deep into the heart of SnowDancer territory, conscious the wolves would go on red alert at the first sign of an intruder.</p><p>Now, taking extreme care not to touch any surface that\u2019d hold a scent, he came close enough to see, but not be seen. Sienna Lauren\u2019s hair, he thought, glimpsing her in the arms of a tall man\u2014not the SnowDancer alpha\u2014had darkened considerably. Her height, however, remained much as it had been at fifteen.</p><p>A single scan and he found Judd. Garbed in black, his fellow rebel was standing on the edge of the dance circle, but he wasn\u2019t alone. A small blonde woman, a slice of cake on the plate she held in hand, leaned her back against his chest. One of Judd\u2019s arms was wrapped with familiar ease around her waist as he spoke to a man the Ghost recognized as a SnowDancer lieutenant.</p> <p>Kenji Tanaka.</p><p>Forking up a bite of cake, the blonde woman twisted and offered it to Judd. He leaned down to accept, the curve of his lips set in an unmistakable smile. The Ghost had only ever seen Judd in another context, and though intellectually he\u2019d understood the former Arrow had a life beyond the rebellion, seeing it in reality made him take a risk, remain longer. For this, too, he could offer no rational reason. This was not a life he would ever have. It may as well have been an alien wilderness.</p><p>Yet ... he continued to watch.</p><p>NOT far in front of Sienna, Mercy hauled Riley into a wild kiss. The senior lieutenant\u2019s surprise lasted a bare instant before he snapped his hands around the leopard sentinel\u2019s waist and dragged her close.</p><p>Turning to Hawke, Sienna said, \u201cThis is just so...\u201d No words seemed enough.</p> <p>\u201cI think someone\u2019s about to steal you from me again.\u201d</p><p>Opening her mouth to protest that she\u2019d hardly spent any time with him all night, she sensed the psychic energy of the person behind her. Her heart burst with love. \u201cSorry,\u201d she murmured, touching her fingertips to Hawke\u2019s jaw. \u201cI\u2019m going to ditch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember\u201d\u2014he rubbed his thumb over her lower lip before putting her hand into her new partner\u2019s\u2014\u201cthe midnight dance is mine.\u201d</p><p>Always. It was a whisper along the mating bond. Out loud, she said, \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d and fixed her brother\u2019s hair.</p><p>He scowled. To her shock, she realized he\u2019d gained several inches of height when she hadn\u2019t been looking. No wonder he looked like a beanpole, if this was how fast he was growing.</p><p>\u201cJeez, Sienna. Don\u2019t do that here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOops. Sorry.\u201d Sometimes, she forgot he was heading toward thirteen, and then the incipient teenager in him would make an appearance. \u201cYou look very handsome.\u201d</p><p>His smile was shy and sweet, and she had the thought that her empathic baby brother was going to grow up into an incredible man. \u201cThanks. I went online shopping with Lara.\u201d Spinning her around in a slick circle, he grinned at her startlement. \u201cDrew taught me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d</p><p>Toby\u2019s smile shimmered into a deeper, more poignant expression. \u201cIt hurts my heart in the best way that you\u2019re so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Toby.\u201d Always, she had loved the brother she hadn\u2019t been permitted to know as a child, but never had she been able to protect him from the psychic price demanded by her gift. \u201cYou\u2019re the best kid brother a girl could have.\u201d</p><p>I love you, Sienna. He spun her out again, sending her skirts flying.</p><p>When he finally relinquished her, it was to another member of her family. Walker\u2019s hold was as calm as Toby\u2019s had been exuberant, his pale green eyes intent. \u201cHe\u2019s your mate,\u201d Walker said, the warning clear for all that it was made in a tempered voice, \u201cbut if he ever does anything to hurt you, you come to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre all men so bloodthirsty?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLara\u2019s father showed me his tools\u2014then we had an illuminating conversation about how easy it would be to cut a person in half using one of the lasers. It was very civilized.\u201d</p><p>Sienna stifled a laugh at the idea of gentle Mack threatening Walker, and tipping back her head, looked into a face she\u2019d never seen violent either in anger or in love. That meant nothing. She knew Walker would die for her without blinking, that he loved her so fiercely, some part of her had sensed it even in the darkest part of her Silence.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cFor being my father.\u201d In every way that mattered.</p><p>Walker\u2019s expression altered only the minutest fraction, but she saw the storm of naked emotion crash across the green before he stroked his hand over her hair and kissed her gently on the forehead. \u201cYou make me proud each and every day.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung. Swallowing, she hid her face against the wide chest of the man who had always found a way to tell her that she mattered, that she wasn\u2019t just an X but family.</p><p>COOPER waited until the dancing had gentled, and he and Riaz were sitting having a couple of quiet beers, before saying, \u201cShe\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking for the tall senior soldier with those amazing eyes. Adria, I think.\u201d Cooper shifted the upturned wooden crate he was using as a seat, settling it more securely. \u201cShe slipped away with Sam a few minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s hand clenched on the bottle. He wanted to deny his raw compulsion toward Adria, but Coop knew him too well, would call him on it. \u201cEnjoying the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even a question.\u201d Dark eyes watched him with relentless patience. \u201cYou going to talk about it, or do I have to remind you I\u2019m bigger and stronger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams.\u201d</p><p>Coop tipped back the bottle he held, his throat muscles moving. When he lowered it, he shook his head. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with you, man. I should\u2019ve picked it up earlier, but Grace scrambled my brains.\u201d</p><p>Riaz looked out at where a lushly curved woman with ebony curls and skin like cream was dancing with Alexei, her smile shy. Big, bad Cooper\u2019s mate was a sweet submissive, but she was managing to handle the male lieutenants\u2014all of whom considered it their right to dance with her. \u201cI can see how,\u201d Riaz said, having claimed a dance earlier. \u201cShe\u2019s something else, Coop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The other man\u2019s expression shifted from brutally tender to hard-ass the instant he returned his attention to Riaz. \u201cAdria, she messing with your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, man,\u201d Riaz said, finishing off his beer and dangling the bottle between his fingers, \u201clet it go. It\u2019s a night to enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Cooper raised an eyebrow. \u201cWho screwed my head on straight when I was courting Grace? I woke you up at two thirty in the fricking morning twice and you didn\u2019t tell me to shut the hell up. So talk\u2014or we\u2019ll be here all night.\u201d</p><p>Riaz knew he could stonewall the other lieutenant. He also knew Coop wouldn\u2019t stop battering at that wall until it gave. But he refused to taint the happiness of the other man\u2019s mating with the bitter taste of his pain. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess, and it\u2019s a mess I might not ever be ready to talk about.\u201d He held the near black of the other man\u2019s eyes, let him see his resolve. \u201cSo I\u2019m asking you to drop it.\u201d</p><p>A long silence before Coop got up and grabbed them two more beers, moving with a predatory grace that was unusual given his size\u2014and that made him a hunter no one ever heard coming. \u201cYou\u2019re a stubborn asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou surprised?\u201d</p><p>Snorting, Cooper leaned forward with his forearms braced on his thighs. \u201cFine. I won\u2019t push\u2014for now.\u201d Open warning. \u201cI see you going downhill, I will come down on you like a ton of bricks. I will not let you go it alone, lone-wolf style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came home,\u201d Riaz growled. \u201cNot exactly lone-wolfing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI call bullshit.\u201d Cooper held his gaze, his wolf apparent in the ring of yellow that now encircled his irises. \u201cYou fucking pick up the phone when things get too dark, or I swear to God, I will tie you up and ship you to my territory.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s claws slid out. \u201cI\u2019m not a juvenile, so back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re my hardheaded idiot of a friend.\u201d He glanced up. \u201cGrace is coming over, so let me just say this\u2014the pack needs you whole and stable. Keep that in mind before you let whatever it is that\u2019s messing with your head swallow you up.\u201d</p><p>SLIDING her fingers around the cup of coffee In\u00e9s handed her, Adria took a seat around the laz-fire one of the other senior soldiers had set up far enough away from the main party that no one would stumble upon them by accident. It was a few minutes after midnight, and not a single SnowDancer was even close to ready for the celebration to end. Even the pups were trying valiantly to keep their eyes open\u2014no one had the heart to send them off to bed, so they\u2019d been snuggled into sleeping bags around the Pack Circle, watched over by elders who preferred to rest their bones.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were doing this,\u201d she said to In\u00e9s, not wanting to step on any toes since she hadn\u2019t officially been invited. Sam was the one who\u2019d brought her along.</p><p>In\u00e9s shook her head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t planned. Elias has some good news to give, decided tonight was the right night for it. He mentioned it to Simran, who mentioned it to me, I mentioned it to Sam, told him to grab you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014and presto.\u201d Adria grinned. This kind of thing had happened in Matthias\u2019s sector, too, different parts of the pack breaking off to have their own informal gatherings during the course of a larger event. \u201cGood idea to ask everyone to bring along some food from the Circle.\u201d</p><p>Several purloined plates of cookies, cakes, and sandwiches, along with a bowl of corn chips with a side of guacamole, were being passed around, as was the thermos of coffee. Someone had also brought in beers and champagne for those who had already finished their assigned shifts on watch. Adria had one coming up, so she\u2019d stick to coffee. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat was Eli,\u201d In\u00e9s said, stretching out her legs as they sat side by side on a fallen log. \u201cHe thinks of everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the good news?\u201d Adria asked.</p><p>In\u00e9s had just opened her mouth to reply when Sam, who\u2019d gone to grab a sandwich, reappeared at Adria\u2019s side without food, a concerned look on his face. \u201cIn\u00e9s, am I crashing a party for the senior soldiers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould it worry you if you were?\u201d A dry response.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might have a secret ritual you were about to do or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike dance naked around the fire?\u201d In\u00e9s raised an eyebrow. \u201cI bet.\u201d</p><p>Dimple flashing, Sam leaned his back against the log, one arm hooked companionably over Adria\u2019s knee. \u201cFine, I\u2019m staying until someone kicks me out.\u201d</p><p>Now that he\u2019d pointed it out, Adria realized Sam was the only soldier of lower rank here. And since In\u00e9s had specifically invited him ... Hmm. She glanced at the other woman in silent question. In\u00e9s winked. Adria bit back a smile, the contentment inside her nothing she\u2019d expected to feel after that brutal encounter with Riaz.</p> <p>Her hand tightened on the coffee cup, her skin tingling from the heat. No, she said silently when her mind tried to claw her back to a carnal madness that had come perilously close to stripping her of her self-respect. Taking a deep breath, she narrowed her attention to the gentle warmth inside of her, and to the people responsible for her emotional equilibrium.</p><p>These were her peers, the packmates she\u2019d be working most closely with over the coming months and years, and though they were relative strangers yet, she liked their energy as a group. Temperate and stable for the most part, senior soldiers were the workhorses of the pack, people you could count on to get a task done.</p><p>In\u00e9s, she thought, had the potential to become a close friend\u2014the fleet-of-foot woman had a snarky sense of humor that made Adria\u2019s own wolf chuckle.</p><p>Right on the heels of that thought, In\u00e9s said, \u201cMe and Simran\u201d\u2014she nodded at where the more reticent soldier sat talking to Brody about something\u2014\u201chave a bad movie night once a month. You should come.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf stretched out, back bowed. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I invited to this movie night,\u201d Sam interrupted to say, \u201cor were you planning to ignore me sitting right here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe ignore one,\u201d In\u00e9s answered, quick as a shot.</p><p>\u201cMy heart is broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bleed for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t my best effort.\u201d</p><p>Elias stood and clapped his hands, cutting off the pithy dialogue. Once he had everyone\u2019s attention, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s time for the secret ceremony,\u201d with a straight face.</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>SAM SNICKERED ... AND sobered when he realized everyone was staring at him, not a giggle to be heard. \u201cUm, sorry.\u201d</p> <p>Adria was trying so hard not to burst out laughing, she had to fake a coughing fit. Several people seemed to have been struck with the same affliction\u2014though In\u00e9s managed to keep it together, slapping Adria helpfully on the back. \u201cMust be the pollen in the air,\u201d she murmured in faux concern.</p><p>Adria would\u2019ve kicked the other woman if Sam hadn\u2019t been sitting in front of her.</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Elias continued, a rare strand of silver glinting in the rich brown of his hair, \u201cit\u2019s time for the ceremony. But since we appear to have an intruder, we\u2019ll have to deal with him first.\u201d</p><p>Sam rose to his feet, dusting off his jeans. \u201cLook, hey, I can book if you guys\u2014\u201d</p><p>Elias raised a hand for silence, moving to stand in front of Sam.</p><p>\u201cSam Baker,\u201d he said, his face solemn, \u201caccording to those witnesses who weren\u2019t unconscious at the time, you ran onto the field of battle time and time again to rescue injured packmates, though you\u2019d been hit with a bullet yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was what any one of us would\u2019ve done.\u201d Sam\u2019s words were quiet, the playful soldier replaced by the courageous man who\u2019d fought with all his heart, even when surrounded by blood and agony and an enemy devoid of mercy.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Elias said, reaching out to pin something on Sam\u2019s stone gray shirt, \u201cand we\u2019re proud to call you one of our own.\u201d</p><p>Adria saw the instant it hit Sam. His fingers trembled as he touched the regal form of the small silver wolf on his shirt collar. None of the senior soldiers wore the pins in daily life, but each one did so tonight\u2014her top too light to hold it, Adria had attached hers to a thin silver bracelet on her left wrist. That tiny badge was a source of enormous pride, not being simply an indication of promotion from soldier to senior, but of acceptance within the rank.</p><p>Slapping a still-stunned Sam on the back, Elias raised his glass, \u201cTo Sam!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Sam!\u201d Adria cried with the rest of the group, and right then, she knew she\u2019d make it. Maybe her unhealthy and untenable attraction to Riaz showed no signs of abating, the clawing need tearing at her gut, but she was more than the primal urges of her body. She was part of this strong, loyal group, a woman who had built a new life, new friendships from the cold ashes of the old.</p><p>No man was ever again going to drive her to question her own worth.</p><p>Her wolf\u2019s body thrummed with defiant, determined pride. And when the newest senior soldier in the den threw back his head and celebrated with wild abandon, she lent her voice to his song alongside those of her packmates.</p><p>THE bristles on Hawke\u2019s jaw caught on Sienna\u2019s hair. She\u2019d watched him shave before the ceremony, but it was now on the edge of dawn and they were finally in bed, his arm holding her to his chest. Enjoying the intimacy of talking with him as much as she\u2019d enjoyed dancing in his arms until the sky shimmered with the first pearly kiss of morning, she glanced up when he shifted to fold one of his arms behind his head.</p><p>Eyes of wolf blue met her own. \u201cYour friends snuck off to do some mischief.\u201d An alpha\u2019s amusement. \u201cI expected you to join them since you\u2019re the head troublemaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned them they\u2019d be on their own tonight ... last night now.\u201d The friends she\u2019d made were friends she intended to keep for life\u2014but the night had been hers and Hawke\u2019s. \u201cI waited so long for this moment,\u201d she whispered, touching her fingers to his jaw, the stubble rough against her fingertips. \u201cSometimes, I think I\u2019m dreaming and I\u2019m so scared I\u2019ll wake up.\u201d</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t try to talk away her fears\u2014he understood the life she\u2019d lived, this wolf who had never known the PsyNet, and yet who knew her. He understood that some nightmares couldn\u2019t be overcome by logic or reason. Only time had that power. Her fear of losing him, as she\u2019d lost her kind, gifted mother, as she\u2019d lost her brother and the rest of her family for so long, was a darkling thought that had made her gasp awake more than once, her heart pounding as if she\u2019d been racing desperately toward him.</p><p>Then she\u2019d feel her wolf strong and warm beside her, or open her psychic eye to the wild silver-blue and flame-hued passion of their bond, and the terror would abate. One day, she thought, it would no longer return, but until then, her wolf would walk beside her into the darklands. \u201cI wanted my mother at our ceremony,\u201d she confessed, eyes burning.</p><p>Indigo and Tarah had done their best, been there for her every step of the way, but it wasn\u2019t the same. \u201cI don\u2019t even have anything of hers to hold on to.\u201d It had all been destroyed after her mother\u2019s suicide, while Sienna had been trapped in a psychic prison with a monster named Ming LeBon.</p><p>\u201cThis beautiful hair,\u201d Hawke said, his chest rumbling under her palm. \u201cJudd once told me it reminded him of his sister.\u201d He played his fingers along the strands. \u201cYou are a piece of her, you and Toby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice,\u201d she said, hiding the wonderful thought away in the secret place inside her mind where she\u2019d kept everything that mattered to her for so long.</p><p>Judd, having learned the skill from Walker, had shown her how to build the impregnable telepathic vault when he\u2019d grown old and experienced enough to teleport to her without alerting Ming. Though she no longer needed the vault, she liked having her most precious memories in one place.</p><p>\u201cToby has her hair, too,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t otherwise look like her\u201d\u2014as he grew, her brother\u2019s features had begun to lean more toward the harder angles of Walker\u2019s face\u2014\u201cbut sometimes I see her in his smile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a gift.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Stroking his chest, she said, \u201cYou missed your parents, too, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father would\u2019ve been so proud to see how the pack reacted to us,\u201d he said in answer, a poignant smile on his lips, \u201cand my mother, she\u2019d have been sitting in a corner, sketching as fast as her hand could move.\u201d</p><p>Images formed in Sienna\u2019s mind, created from the photos Hawke had shared with her. Of a tall man with golden hair, eyes of blue a shade darker than his son\u2019s, and a white-blonde woman, her bones fine, her skin porcelain. The snapshots of his mother, Aren, were lit with laughter, while her mate, Tristan, had been more guarded, his gaze piercing ... except in the few precious photos Hawke had of the two of them together. There, it was clear who held Tristan\u2019s heart, nothing guarded or remote about the intensity of his love.</p><p>\u201cPsy don\u2019t give credence to the idea of an afterlife,\u201d she said, trailing her fingers over the hard ridges of his abdomen, \u201cbut I\u2019d like to believe that last night, all the people we miss were there dancing alongside us.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s hand stroked under her hair to settle on her nape. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They were quiet for a long time, happy to simply be together. Breathing in the hot, wild scent that was Hawke, she felt a sense of wonder bloom deep within.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s got you smiling?\u201d her mate asked in a slumberous voice, though she lay with her cheek on his chest, her face hidden from view. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo one who saw us interacting before we mated,\u201d she said, pushing up so she could look down into curious wolf eyes, her hair pooling on his chest, \u201cwould ever believe we could be so peaceful together.\u201d She\u2019d been half afraid they would clash the entire time, because that was all they\u2019d done for years. What she hadn\u2019t understood until afterward was that the passionate need she and Hawke had fought for so long would become a molten river. Connecting them. Making them whole.</p><p>Even in this peace, the embers glowed. Always would.</p><p>Hawke chuckled. \u201cI would\u2019ve recommended a good shrink if someone had suggested it to me six months ago.\u201d</p> <p>Laughing, she braced herself on one arm and began to play with his hair, petting him until his eyes closed. He was still awake, his fingers brushing lightly against her back, but he was a lazy wolf now, contented and sleepy. Yawning, she snuggled down against his body and let the rhythm of his heartbeat lull her into a sleep devoid of fear ... and filled with dreams of an alpha wolf who ran beside her as she explored the mysteries of a night-dark forest.</p><p>RIAZ watched the cold dawn from his position seated against a large ponderosa pine on the edge of a mountain lake rippling with gossamer whispers of wind. The mating celebration had finally wound down about forty-five minutes ago, every one of the lieutenants remaining till the very end.</p><p>The out-of-towners had slipped away as stealthily as they\u2019d arrived, while those who called den territory home had broken off to head to bed, or to otherwise relax after the night\u2019s festivities. The most interesting departure had been Jem and Kenji\u2019s\u2014they\u2019d left together, and Kenji had a bruise on his cheek he refused to explain.</p><p>It had been instinct for Riaz to come up into the mountains. Man and wolf, they were both used to aloneness, often needed solitude, especially after a social event, but over the past minutes, he\u2019d realized this aloneness was of a different kind.</p><p>It hurt.</p> <p>A dull, throbbing ache, the pain was centered in the place where the mating bond should\u2019ve been, as if he had an open wound deep inside him. The joy and warmth of his packmates had muted the ache over the night, but surrounded by nothing but the chill air of the Sierras, the sky a crimson-orange cauldron, he could no longer avoid the truth. He\u2019d come home to heal ... but the wound, it bled darkest red.</p><p>The echo of a male voice.</p><p>Catching the unexpected sound on the wind, he looked across the lake to glimpse a small, sleek wolf padding beside a tall male dressed in black. The wolf\u2019s body brushed the man\u2019s as they walked along the misty earth, the man\u2019s fingers trailing through the animal\u2019s fur when he bent as if to speak to her.</p><p>Riaz\u2019s hand fisted, a corrosive bitterness flooding his senses.</p><p>The ugliness of it was a cold slap.</p><p>Breathless, chest pounding in shock, he looked up in time to see Brenna and Judd disappear into the mist. However, his mind was no longer on the other couple, but on the staggering insight into who he was becoming, who he was allowing himself to become: a bitter, angry man filled with the acid of envy.</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t who he wanted to be, wasn\u2019t who he\u2019d ever been. Just like he hadn\u2019t ever been a man who liked to hurt women on any level.</p><p>An image of Adria\u2019s stunning eyes, the icy whip of her anger, the sway of her hips as she walked away from him.</p><p>God, he\u2019d been a shit to her. Shame was leaden in his gut. Nothing excused the way he\u2019d treated her, the way he\u2019d tried to use her. Adria was right. She deserved more than a man who had permitted his anger at fate to eat away at him until he almost didn\u2019t recognize who he was anymore. His wolf, always so proud, lowered its head, its tail limp, but both parts of him knew this silent penance wasn\u2019t enough. The man he wanted to be, the man he\u2019d been before Lisette, blamed no one else for his own faults, and faced up to his mistakes.</p><p>The sun touched him with golden fingers but did nothing to ease the ice in his soul.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>MING EXAMINED THE satellite images captured when Sienna Lauren had allowed her cold fire to feed. Though taken in the night-darkness of the battle, there was no absence of light, the red and yellow of the deadly fire an inferno.</p><p>Setting those images aside, he looked at the ones taken directly after the battle. The carnage was absolute, the forest a wasteland. No sign remained of the Pure Psy army.</p><p>An incredible weapon.</p> <p>One Ming had been certain he wanted destroyed if she had survived, because she could not be controlled. Except ... His eye went to the small steel box on his desk. It held within it a single chip, the last remaining prototype from Ashaya Aleine\u2019s aborted project to instigate Silence on a biological level.</p><p>That chip could also be utilized as a leash.</p><p>The problem with using it in such a fashion had always been twofold. One, the chip was unstable. Two, Ming would need to have a controller chip implanted to interface with Sienna\u2019s, and even had he considered the risk acceptable, this was the single surviving chip of which he had per-sonal knowledge. He\u2019d had it excised from one of the victims the Scotts had implanted, after the male\u2019s suicide. Neither Henry nor Shoshanna had ever realized he knew of their unauthorized experimentation. Ming\u2019s scientists hadn\u2019t been able to reverse engineer the chip, however, one had just informed him that there was a very slight chance it could be altered to allow control via a remote device.</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d he said into the intercom.</p><p>If the device worked, he would own an X. If it failed, Sienna Lauren would die in an implosion of brain cells.</p><p>A perfect solution.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>HAVING HAD A message that the senior lieutenant wanted to see her, Adria knocked on the door to Riley\u2019s office three days after the mating ceremony, found herself being waved in though he held a phone to his ear. \u201cGrab a seat,\u201d he said. \u201cThis\u2019ll only take a sec.\u201d</p><p>As she waited, she took in his office. It was\u2014and wasn\u2019t\u2014what she would\u2019ve expected. Ordered and clean, it was free of clutter. That fit the lieutenant\u2019s rock-solid, calm nature. What didn\u2019t fit was the framed poster behind his desk\u2014of the kaleidoscope of color, flesh, feathers, sequins, and more that was Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Carnaval.</p><p>Or perhaps it did fit, she thought with an inward smile. After all, pragmatic, sensible Riley had crossed dangerous pack lines to claim a leopard sentinel as his mate. No one, she reminded herself, was one-dimensional ... not even the angry man who\u2019d had his hands so hot and rough on her skin. \u201cHave you been?\u201d she asked Riley when he hung up the phone, shoving the raw memories away before they could derail her all over again.</p><p>Following her gaze to the poster, he nodded. \u201cSurvived it, too.\u201d A smile that had a story behind it. \u201cHow was the outer-perimeter shift? You got back this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was good. Peaceful.\u201d She\u2019d left the afternoon after the mating ceremony, taking over from one of the leopards. \u201cI\u2019m happy to do extra shifts up there.\u201d</p><p>Instead of accepting the offer, Riley leaned back in his chair, dark eyes intent. \u201cYou\u2019re a highly experienced senior soldier, Adria\u2014running patrol will frustrate you if you don\u2019t have other outlets for your skill. Matthias tells me you were in charge of training the novices in his region.\u201d</p><p>It had been incredibly hard to walk away from \u201cher\u201d kids, but she\u2019d been worried her emotional troubles would spill over into her teaching. So she\u2019d trained up a replacement and made sure her novices were comfortable with the other soldier before she left. Things had changed in the interim, and she missed working with their young, but would not do so at the expense of another packmate, especially one she loved.</p><p>\u201cIndigo\u2019s brilliant at what she does.\u201d Though she tried to keep her tone even, her wolf bristled.</p><p>\u201cNo argument,\u201d Riley said at once. \u201cI have something else in mind for you.\u201d He waited, as if giving her the opportunity to interrupt. When she didn\u2019t, he continued. \u201cAccording to Matthias, you\u2019re very good with the submissives. Which doesn\u2019t surprise me, given the true status of your rank.\u201d</p><p>Of course Riley would know. \u201cA trainer working with submissives,\u201d she said with a smile, \u201chas to realize that while they\u2019re never going to be soldiers, they have unique strengths of their own.\u201d The most vulnerable in the hierarchy didn\u2019t respond well to the necessarily ruthless teaching style utilized to train the dominants.</p><p>Riley gave a small nod. \u201cI\u2019d like you to take over the self-defense training of twenty-five submissive kids, ages fourteen to eighteen. They\u2019ve had the normal course, but Hawke wants them to get as much advanced training as they\u2019re able to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe continuing hostilities,\u201d Adria said, knowing the alpha had to be thinking about a situation where the dominants were killed in large numbers. A hard thing to contemplate, but it had to be done.</p><p>\u201cYou should talk to Walker.\u201d Riley passed across a datapad loaded with a list of names and photos. \u201cYour group\u2019s skewed toward the younger age group. He gave most of those kids their basic training. The older ones, Eli handled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll touch base with them both.\u201d Adria knew how important it was that the three of them work as a unit. \u201cWho\u2019s training the maternal kids?\u201d A second later, she clicked her fingers, her wolf nudging at her. \u201cI bet you it\u2019s Drew.\u201d</p><p>Riley laughed. \u201cMy brother knows how to walk that fine line between making sure they never forget he\u2019s more dominant, and not pissing them off. He\u2019s got forty in his group, been working with them for months.\u201d</p><p>Adria whistled. \u201cThose are big numbers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurns out we had more than the usual number of births fourteen to eighteen years ago. A statistically significant percentage of those pups are turning out to be dominants\u2014soldier and maternal, but it\u2019s affected every level of the hierarchy.\u201d</p><p>Adria\u2019s wolf lifted its muzzle in a silent, mournful howl as understanding whispered through her veins. Changelings were the least fertile of the three races, but it had been observed over and over that when a pack lost a brutal number of its own within a short time frame, birth rates spiked in the years following. And SnowDancer had suffered heartbreaking losses two decades ago. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Riley had the same solemn knowledge in his eyes when he said, \u201cQuestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything I need to know about the kids that might not be immediately apparent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalker\u2019s probably the best person to answer that,\u201d Riley said, picking up his phone. \u201cI\u2019ll see if he\u2019s available.\u201d</p> <p>Walker wasn\u2019t in the den, but they were able to catch him on his cell. \u201cCall me at any stage,\u201d he said after they\u2019d finished going through the list, his insight into the pups she\u2019d be taking on displaying a sensitivity to the needs of the young that resonated deeply with her. \u201cThey know they can come to me no matter what, and might do so until they begin to trust you\u2014I\u2019ll let you know if any issues crop up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Ending the call soon afterward, Riley said, \u201cHalf your group\u2019s on a field trip, but they\u2019ll be back by seven. Unless you have another commitment, we\u2019ll meet at eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight works. See you then.\u201d She headed out of the office, deciding to use her free time to further explore the territory as Hawke had requested.</p><p>She\u2019d only been walking for a minute when she saw the most amazing sight.</p> <p>Two small leopard cubs scrabbled around the corner, obviously racing each other ... to come to a dead stop, claws scraping on stone, when they saw her. Two heads lifted. Two pairs of beautiful green-gold eyes held her own.</p><p>Glancing around, Adria saw the corridor was otherwise deserted. \u201cI don\u2019t think,\u201d she whispered, crouching down to run her hand over the fur of the one closest to her, \u201cyou\u2019re supposed to be here.\u201d DarkRiver and SnowDancer were blood-allies, but leaving a child to roam the den alone was a huge step beyond that. So either these two adorable troublemakers\u2014both of whom were now demanding to be petted\u2014had escaped their frantic mother, or they\u2019d somehow snuck in. Adria would\u2019ve said they were too small to navigate the distance from DarkRiver land, but she\u2019d known too many children.</p><p>The sound of more claws against stone, right before a tiny wolf pup attacked the cubs from behind. Stunned, she was about to pull them apart when she realized the growling and snarling and clawing was all for show. She rose to her feet, her wolf too amused to think about spoiling their fun.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a sight.\u201d</p><p>The hairs on her nape rose at the low, deep timbre of that male voice, but she didn\u2019t startle, having scented the exotic dark pine and biting edge of citrus that was Riaz\u2019s scent. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, proud of herself for keeping her cool.</p><p>Another scent. Unfamiliar. Feminine.</p> <p>The cubs and pup jumped apart as if they\u2019d been doused with cold water, and suddenly, they were sitting quiet and lovable, three of the most well-behaved little ones Adria had ever seen. \u201cLittle fakers,\u201d she said, attempting to hide her laugh.</p><p>Beside her, Riaz coughed just as a tall brunette turned the corner.</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d the woman said to the cubs, \u201cdid we discuss before we left home?\u201d Folding her arms, she tapped an impatient tattoo on the floor with her booted foot.</p><p>The wolf pup barked.</p><p>\u201cHush, Ben. These two were supposed to wait for me to finish talking with Lara.\u201d</p><p>Dropping their heads, the cubs made piteous mewling sounds. Adria caught the amusement in the eyes of the woman who had to be their mother, but her voice when it came, was stern. \u201cYou have a choice of punishments: either no playtime with Ben and the other pups, or no chocolate cake for dessert tonight.\u201d</p><p>All three children looked at the woman in unmitigated shock.</p><p>Who didn\u2019t budge.</p> <p>The leopard cubs nodded at their friend\u2014who was apparently more attractive than chocolate cake. Bending down, the brunette grabbed and kissed each sweet face in turn, including Ben\u2019s. \u201cNow go wait for me over there\u201d\u2014she waved to a spot a couple of meters down the corridor, where they\u2019d remain in her line of sight\u2014\u201cunless you want playtime permanently cancelled.\u201d</p><p>Only when the boys had padded away to take meek seated positions, did the woman rise and meet Adria\u2019s and Riaz\u2019s gazes. \u201cThey give me three new gray hairs hourly.\u201d Exasperated affection.</p><p>\u201cTamsyn,\u201d Riaz said, the heat of his body too close, too aggressive, \u201cthis is Adria.\u201d</p><p>Adria forced herself to think past her gut-clawing awareness of the male next to her. \u201cThe DarkRiver healer.\u201d All senior personnel had been briefed about DarkRiver long ago.</p><p>\u201cIf you say you\u2019re not related to Indigo,\u201d Tamsyn said in response, \u201cI\u2019ll eat my boot ... if the twins haven\u2019t already.\u201d</p><p>Laughing at the dry codicil, Adria admitted to the familial relationship. \u201cSocial visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAshaya\u2019s here, too,\u201d Tamsyn said, referring to the M-Psy mated to a DarkRiver sentinel. \u201cWe want to discuss Alice, go over some new scans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlice\u201d was Alice Eldridge, a human scientist who had been put into cryonic suspension over a hundred years ago and now slept in a coma no one could break. Adria couldn\u2019t imagine what Alice\u2019s life would be like if she did wake\u2014the world had shifted dramatically since the beginning of her forced sleep. Her friends, her family, each and every one was dust. And yet Alice endured.</p><p>\u201cI better get back and organize an escort for the hooligans,\u201d Tammy said, looking over her shoulder at the children with an affectionate smile. \u201cIt was nice to meet you, Adria.\u201d</p><p>The silence that fell after Tamsyn and the boys left was awkward. However, when Adria would have continued on her way, Riaz shifted to block her. Lines of strain marked his face, a heavy shadow over the beaten gold of his eyes, but his words were unexpectedly generous. \u201cI have some time free\u2014why don\u2019t I show you some of the more hidden parts of den territory?\u201d</p><p>Unsettled, Adria glanced up, found herself unable to read his expression. She\u2019d spent far too much time with another man whose face she couldn\u2019t read, so she was blunt in her disbelief. \u201cWhat possible reason could you have for inviting me to spend time with you when we both know how you feel about me?\u201d</p><p>Riaz had expected the claws, his wolf taking the hit without flinching. \u201cBecause,\u201d he said, carrying through the decision he\u2019d made that cold, lonely dawn after Hawke and Sienna\u2019s mating ceremony, \u201cit\u2019s not your fault you\u2019re not my mate.\u201d It felt as if he\u2019d stripped off his skin with the admission, but he owed Adria the truth. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry I punished you for that.\u201d</p><p>Adria had frozen after his first sentence, horror dawning black and violent over her clean, beautiful features. \u201cYou found your mate? How could you kiss me?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to talk about it, wanted to pretend he\u2019d never set sight on Lisette, but the time for hiding behind anger and an obstinate refusal to admit the truth was over. \u201cShe\u2019s married.\u201d In love with another man. Coop was right\u2014he could allow that to destroy him, or he could rebuild a new life from the broken shards of the old.</p><p>He was a wolf, a dominant, a protector. To give up and leave his pack without his strength was simply not in his nature. So he\u2019d find a way to survive, and to once again become a man he could face in the mirror with pride.</p><p>In front of him, Adria\u2019s eyes turned the pale, haunting amber of her wolf in painful sympathy. His jaw set. He didn\u2019t want pity, had told her only because she\u2019d borne the brunt of his rage when she\u2019d never been at fault. But there was no hint of pity in her response, simply a warm generosity of spirit that rocked him. \u201cIf your wolf isn\u2019t troubled by my presence,\u201d she said, \u201cthen I\u2019d appreciate your help.\u201d</p><p>Troubled?</p><p>Riaz swallowed a harsh laugh. \u201cWe\u2019ll drive out of the section you already know well,\u201d he said, determined to treat her with the courtesy he should\u2019ve shown her from the start, regardless of the touch-hunger that continued to claw at him, \u201cand explore a less accessible part of the remaining area on foot.\u201d</p><p>Adria stayed silent until they\u2019d driven for at least ten minutes, but it was a silence heavy with things unsaid. When she did speak, he flinched.</p><p>\u201cDid you ... have a chance?\u201d</p><p>His hands flexed on the wheel. \u201cShe loves her husband. I just found her too late.\u201d He regretted saying as much as he had as soon as he\u2019d spoken, his wolf uncomfortable with the sudden, stark vulnerability. \u201cIndigo knows the bare facts\u201d\u2014and he wished she didn\u2019t\u2014\u201cbut no one else does, so if you could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say a word,\u201d she promised in that slightly husky voice that was an unintended provocation. \u201cYou can talk to me about it, you know.\u201d A hesitation. \u201cIt can\u2019t be good for you to hold everything inside.\u201d</p><p>Shifting the vehicle into hover mode, he took them over a rocky patch. \u201cThere\u2019s not much to talk about.\u201d He wasn\u2019t being obdurate\u2014what else was there to say? Lisette belonged to another man, and Riaz had to figure out a way to live with that.</p><p>\u201cNo, I suppose there isn\u2019t.\u201d Not speaking again till they stepped out of the vehicle in a relatively isolated section of den territory, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s stay in human form. It\u2019ll be easier to talk.\u201d</p><p>He nodded\u2014a few sections would be tricky to navigate on two feet, but they could always reconsider shifting at that stage.</p><p>As they walked, he saw Adria take in everything with those stunning eyes of blue-violet. It was the first time he\u2019d really looked at her, not blinded by the caustic mix of anger and desire that had colored their earlier interactions. There was a steely strength to her gaze\u2014as if she\u2019d been tempered in pain and come out of it harder, less breakable.</p><p>His fascination with her shifted a fraction, became more subtle, more complex ... more disturbing, as he realized he wanted to know of the crucible that had honed her. \u201cThere\u2019s something you should see here,\u201d he said, caught between the competing needs of a fidelity that would destroy him, and a silken betrayal that might tear him apart.</p><p>Chapter 23 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDO YOU SEE your parents often?\u201d he asked almost two hours later, unable to resist the urge to solve the mystery of her.</p><p>A pregnant pause filled only with the sound of the wind rustling through the trees. \u201cNot as much as I should.\u201d</p><p>Reading the tension in the line of her spine, he knew she wanted him to drop it, but regardless of all else, he\u2019d never been a man who took orders when he didn\u2019t want to take them. \u201cOdd for a wolf.\u201d</p> <p>No response as they walked through the spring green meadow. Just when he was beginning to believe she\u2019d simply ignore the question, she said, \u201cI was in a relationship. It made my parents unhappy.\u201d Plain words that told him nothing.</p><p>\u201cDid they make you choose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but we ended up arguing about it every time I went to see Mom and Dad.\u201d She blew out a breath. \u201cTarah, Indigo, neither of them approved, but they let me be for the most part.\u201d</p><p>Riaz wondered what the hell had been wrong with the male Adria had chosen that her entire family hadn\u2019t liked the guy. However, the shuttered expression on her face told him the discussion was over; he could push, but this time, he decided for patience. Dominant female wolves didn\u2019t react well to pressure beyond a certain point.</p><p>As she walked ahead a few steps, his eyes lingered on the soft skin exposed at her nape, beneath the silken rope of her braid. The golden warmth of it glowed in the harsh mountain sunlight, and he wanted only to push that braid aside and run his fingers over the spot.</p> <p>Adria jerked out and to the side, her hair brushing the back of his hand.</p><p>And he realized his fingers had done exactly as he\u2019d imagined. \u201cShit, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Brilliant blue-violet eyes streaked with precious gold watched him with too much knowledge. \u201cYou need to do something about your hunger, Riaz.\u201d</p><p>The idea of being with any woman but Lisette made his entire body revolt, but even then, the scent of Adria, the remembered feel of her, it was a drug, an addiction that gripped him in powerful teeth and shook. \u201cCan you get back on your own?\u201d The words were harsh, his wolf too close to the surface.</p><p>Adria gave a simple, \u201cYes,\u201d before turning and walking away from him a second time, a tall, strong woman with hair as dark as onyx and a pride that he knew would never again allow her to invite him into her bed.</p><p>ADRIA bent over with a shudder, hands on her knees, after Riaz disappeared in the opposite direction. Her body felt as if it wanted to burst out of her skin, torn by a chaos of competing needs and desires. When Riaz had touched her, she\u2019d almost melted into the rough heat of his fingers in spite of her every vow to the contrary, her body already conditioned to expect primal pleasure.</p> <p>Inhaling another shaky breath, she took a detour on her way down to the den, following an overgrown path that, if memory served her right, led to a small hidden waterfall. She\u2019d found it as a young girl, and it had become her secret place, where she came to think over important decisions, or to indulge in frustration and temper.</p><p>A smile tugged her lips. God, she\u2019d been such a serious, temperamental child. As she\u2019d grown, that wildness of emotion had matured into a quiet intensity of passion, restrained and tempered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re magnificent and I can\u2019t wait to learn all of you.\u201d Words Martin had spoken to her during their first year as a couple.</p><p>Her smile faded, into a sadness so deep, it lodged in her chest, a heavy lump. Even the sight of \u201cher\u201d waterfall, small and secretive and effervescent, didn\u2019t lift her spirits. Her mind was with the woman she\u2019d been, so very ready to start what she\u2019d thought would be the next phase of her life, with a man she\u2019d believed would walk beside her as they both changed and grew. And for the first time since she\u2019d made the decision to end their broken relationship, her anger was washed away by grief.</p><p>The Martin she\u2019d known hadn\u2019t been the standoffish man he so often was with strangers, a man secretly uncomfortable in social situations. He\u2019d been so sweet in private, with a wicked sense of humor and a way of looking at her as if she were the most alluring woman in the world. Not only that, but he\u2019d celebrated her achievements as she\u2019d celebrated his.</p><p>She\u2019d taken him to dinner in a posh restaurant when he was awarded his doctorate, and stranger to the kitchen though he had been, he\u2019d once put on an apron and baked her a cake when she\u2019d completed a particularly grueling training course. It had collapsed in the middle and been uncooked around the sides and it had been wonderful. They\u2019d giggled and gotten drunk on cheap pink champagne, eating so much cake that they\u2019d solemnly sworn, \u201cNever, ever again.\u201d</p><p>That was what she\u2019d tried to save for so long, unable and unwilling to believe that something so innocent and bright could sour into such hostility. She\u2019d thought if she tried hard enough, she\u2019d be able to fix it. It was how her brain worked\u2014even as a child who had found martial arts didn\u2019t suit her blunt style of movement, but who knew the skill would come in useful as a soldier, she\u2019d just gritted her teeth and practiced over and over until her body moved with flawless grace.</p><p>Only after she\u2019d been broken on the ruins of their relationship had she understood that no matter how hard she tried, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. Because somewhere along the way, a poison had infiltrated their relationship. Quiet and stealthy, it had eaten into the fabric of emotion that bound them until that fabric was threadbare ... and her wolf had withdrawn totally from the relationship.</p> <p>Martin had known. It had only deepened his resentment.</p><p>Moisture on her cheek, a trail leading down to her mouth. Salt. It was the taste of the first tear she\u2019d shed since shutting the door in Martin\u2019s face over a year ago, knowing she\u2019d never again open it. So fragile, the single iridescent droplet nonetheless shattered her defenses. Dropping to her knees, she allowed the sorrow to pour out of her, her shoulders shaking with the force of her sobs.</p><p>RIAZ caught Adria\u2019s scent as he ran, and snarled, frustrated that her phantom presence continued to haunt him. When it grew stronger instead of fading, he realized she hadn\u2019t returned to the vehicle but had instead continued on foot. He would\u2019ve carried on, except that he caught the barest whisper of a sound that made his wolf snap to attention. Frowning, he moved close enough to ensure that she wasn\u2019t in trouble ... and heard the raw, painful sound of a woman whose heart was breaking.</p><p>His chest knotted, protective instincts roaring to the surface, but he didn\u2019t approach. Adria was a proud, strong woman, wouldn\u2019t appreciate anyone finding her at such a vulnerable moment, her defenses shattered. But even as he told himself to leave, the ragged sound of her tears ripped him apart.</p><p>She jerked up her head the instant he came into view, her face ravaged by tears. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>Wanting to hunt down whatever had so devastated her, but aware it wasn\u2019t a physical foe he could defeat, he went down on his haunches and took her into his arms. She began to struggle, all sharp elbows and tightly fisted hands. \u201cLet me help, damn you.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the smoothest or most charming of things to say, but it came from the gut and the heart, his voice rough with the wolf\u2019s frustration at being unable to do anything.</p><p>Another heartrending sob, and then she was melted wax in his arms, as if she couldn\u2019t deal with the agonizing depth of her pain and hold him off at the same time. Cuddling her as close as he could, his knees spread to tuck her in between, he cupped the back of her head with one hand, wrapped an arm around her waist ... and simply held her as she cried.</p><p>He\u2019d seen strong women cry before, but never like this. Until it felt as if she were being torn apart from the inside out. Hand clenched in her hair, tangling in her braid, he pressed his cheek to the inky black and let her fingernails dig into his back as she wrapped her arms around him in a fierce embrace.</p><p>A minute, a lifetime, later, those hands turned into fists again and she punched at him. The blows had no impact because of her position, but the agony in them was excruciating. His wolf raged at its helplessness, but even then, it pressed against Riaz\u2019s skin, wanting to soothe, to reassure. But all they could do was hold her, the scent of crushed berries in ice drowning in salt.</p><p>The wind was quiet, the sun lower in the sky when she went silent, lying against him in a way that said all the fight had been taken out of her. He\u2019d known her a fragment of time, but he hated seeing her so defeated. Adria was pride and spirit and strength. Not a woman who gave up. \u201cDid you lose someone?\u201d Death was the only thing he could think of to explain the depth of her despair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been long dead.\u201d Rasped out words. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t ready to mourn until now.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his cheek against her hair, one wolf attempting to comfort another. \u201cDo you feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like I got run over.\u201d And that quickly, she was Adria again.</p><p>Shoving away and to her feet, she walked to the pool at the bottom of a tiny waterfall he could just make out, cupping her hands in the cold water and using it to splash her face. At any other time, with any other woman, he would\u2019ve waited, but he could tell from the stiff curve of her spine that she hated the fact he\u2019d seen her like this, so he turned and walked away.</p><p>His wolf snarled but didn\u2019t resist. Because it, too, understood that Adria was no helpless maiden in distress. Riaz had seen her fight beside him with unwavering courage, witnessed her steely-eyed determination as she crawled into the line of fire to drag an injured packmate out of the danger zone, trusted her to watch his back when the enemy threatened to surround them.</p><p>A woman like that would not want any man\u2014much less one with whom she had only the most fragile of cease-fires\u2014to see her defenseless and fractured by grief. He wondered if this would create another barrier between them, as she sought to distance herself from the memory. The idea pricked at his insides, a sharp, unexpected discomfort.</p><p>ALICE</p><p>FROM: Sascha&lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>TO: Lara&lt;</p><p>[email protected] </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>&gt;</p><p>CC: Tammy&lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p> <p>/* */ &gt;;</p><p>Ashaya&lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;;</p><p>Amara&lt;</p> <p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>DATE: Sep 3, 2081 at 11.14 a.m.</p><p>SUBJECT: Patient A</p><p>Lara\u2014I spoke to Tammy and Ashaya, got the latest update on our patient.

He caught Riaz on his way down from the higher elevations, had to wait forty-five minutes for him to arrive.</p><p>\u201cHad lunch?\u201d he asked when the other man walked into his office. It was half past three, but he hadn\u2019t had a chance to eat.</p><p>Riaz sprawled into the chair in front of Hawke\u2019s desk. \u201cNo, but I won\u2019t fade away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might.\u201d Putting through a call to the main kitchen, he asked one of the kids on after-school kitchen duty to bring over two plates. \u201cPasta okay with you?\u201d</p><p>At Riaz\u2019s nod, he added in a request for dessert and grinned at the pert response of the head cook, Aisha, when the juvenile on the phone conveyed the request. Hanging up, he handed Riaz a copy of the BlackSea docs. \u201cWhat do you think about this?\u201d</p><p>Unlike most changeling groups, BlackSea wasn\u2019t composed of one particular species of changeling, but was a conglomerate of all water-based changelings. Several worked on Alaris, the deep-sea station located in the Pacific Ocean, not far from the Mariana Trench, though the station personnel were by no means solely changeling.</p><p>A large number of BlackSea\u2019s people had normal occupations\u2014in cities located by the sea or near large bodies of fresh water, depending on their individual species. There weren\u2019t, however, any water-based changelings in the greater Bay Area, or along the California coastline. Given SnowDancer and DarkRiver\u2019s heavy dominance in the region, BlackSea\u2019s people had given it a wide berth, not wanting to inadvertently cause a territorial skirmish.</p><p>Now they wanted not only permission to move freely in the waters in and around the territory, as well as leave to work in the region, but also an alliance with SnowDancer. However, their vision of the alliance process was very different from Hawke\u2019s. Hence the consult. \u201cWait,\u201d he said when Riaz began to speak. \u201cLet me comm Kenji in since he\u2019s the point person with BlackSea.\u201d</p><p>Toby knocked on the open door right then, using his foot, his hands occupied by a loaded tray. A tug of pride in his gut at the sight of the boy who was now family, Hawke waved him in. \u201cI hear you volunteered to do extra shifts in the kitchen.\u201d According to Sienna, her baby brother was turning into an excellent cook.</p><p>Toby nodded, dark red hair sliding over his forehead as he placed heaping plates of chicken and mushroom fettuccine on Hawke\u2019s desk, followed by a large bowl of salad, big hunks of warm garlic bread, two bottles of water, and two enormous slices of baked cheesecake. Last was the cutlery.</p><p>Beaming at having completed the entire operation without spilling anything, Toby leaned the tray carefully against the wall. \u201cAisha said to call if you need more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Toby. Give Aisha a kiss from us.\u201d Hawke winked.</p><p>Toby left the office with a grin, closing the door behind himself at Hawke\u2019s nod.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s trying to fatten us up.\u201d Riaz groaned as he dug into the fettuccine.</p><p>\u201cSorry, too busy dying of gastronomic bliss to talk.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t even a crumb left when they finished. Deeply satisfied, Hawke brought Kenji into their discussion via the big comm screen on the wall to the right of his desk.</p><p>\u201cTo what do I owe this honor?\u201d Kenji asked, putting down a half-eaten burger, the mysterious bruise on his cheek from the night of the mating ceremony no longer in evidence, though his hair remained a sleek purple sans the gold stars.</p><p>Riaz held up the document in silent explanation.</p><p>Kenji grimaced. \u201cYeah, what\u2019s that about? I didn\u2019t say anything to their negotiator, but it\u2019s not exactly how we do things.\u201d</p><p>Face-to-face, changeling-to-changeling, that was how SnowDancer began a relationship that had the potential to turn into an alliance.</p><p>\u201cBlackSea isn\u2019t usual in any way, shape, or form,\u201d Riaz said, stretching out his legs in front of him after changing position so he could look directly at the screen. \u201cBecause they\u2019re scattered worldwide, they\u2019ve had to develop other ways to connect. It doesn\u2019t help that the majority of their membership is secretive and reticent to the extreme.\u201d</p><p>Hawke rubbed his jaw. \u201cYeah, no one\u2019s ever confirmed if some of the changeling species that are officially part of BlackSea even exist.\u201d Water-based changelings didn\u2019t advertise their species, and many chose to live on the small floating cities in international waters that had been permitted them under the accord signed after the Territorial Wars.</p><p>The cities were open to anyone\u2014if you could find transport to the location: BlackSea had uniformly chosen dangerous stretches of water to anchor its cities, waters a fish alone would be able to navigate. And since they made sure there were no appropriate surfaces on which to land flying craft, the only visitors to their cities were invited ones. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even the Psy left BlackSea alone, most probably because the water changelings did everything they could to stay out of the spotlight. Which brought up another question, but Hawke shelved it for now, because Kenji was speaking.</p><p>\u201cSo, what,\u201d he said, gulping down his soda, \u201cthey function like the Psy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a sense,\u201d Riaz said, furrows between his eyebrows. \u201cDon\u2019t make the mistake of thinking they\u2019re not ferociously loyal to one another just like in any changeling pack, but everything\u2019s recorded and verified so it can be shared with members across the world.\u201d</p> <p>Kenji tapped a laser pen against his cheek. \u201cHonestly, I love the idea of being allied with BlackSea. Their information network alone is invaluable. The question is, can SnowDancer adapt enough to work with a group that functions so differently?\u201d</p><p>It was an astute question.</p><p>Shoving the pen behind his ear, Kenji continued. \u201cWe can\u2019t treat them as we do our Psy business contacts, because as Riaz says, they are changelings and it would piss them off. But, it doesn\u2019t look like we can have the kind of relationship with BlackSea that we do with DarkRiver and are building with WindHaven.\u201d</p><p>Hawke nodded. He trusted the alphas of the leopard and falcon packs on a gut level. Neither Lucas nor Adam would ever knife him in the back, of that both parts of him were dead certain. \u201cAccording to the official line,\u201d he said, \u201cthey don\u2019t have an alpha, but a \u2018Conclave\u2019 that represents all the major and minor species groups in BlackSea.\u201d</p><p>Riaz shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s a load of PR bull. Her name is Miane Lev\u00e8que and she knows everything that happens in BlackSea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Miane was someone Hawke had kept a quiet eye on, as he did the alphas of most major packs. \u201cWhatever else happens, a face-to-face meeting is nonnegotiable.\u201d His wolf would accept nothing less.</p><p>Riaz tapped the rolled-up papers against his knee. \u201cMy advice: we treat this request seriously, go over the contract, and ask for changes as needed. I think they\u2019re feeling us out, seeing if we are able\u2014or at least willing to try\u2014to adapt to their unique way of doing things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be a power play,\u201d Kenji pointed out. \u201cThe minnow trying to get the whale to do as it wishes.\u201d</p><p>Hawke grinned. \u201cExcellent marine analogy, rock star.\u201d</p><p>Kenji played some excellent air guitar. \u201cI\u2019ve been saving it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a little of that, too,\u201d Riaz said, clearly in no doubt about BlackSea\u2019s predatory instincts. \u201cSo we make sure they realize that while we\u2019ll work with them, we won\u2019t budge on the critical meet between Miane and Hawke.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Hawke added, \u201cguaranteed transport in and out of their cities.\u201d Movement had to go both ways for an alliance to work. \u201cIf they plan to stonewall us there, the deal is off the table. And warn them if it happens after we agree to an alliance, we\u2019ll consider it a fatal violation and a declaration of aggression.\u201d SnowDancer had plenty of teeth, and he didn\u2019t want BlackSea in any doubt that they would use those teeth the instant the other group tried to manipulate the situation.</p><p>Riaz\u2019s eyes glinted in agreement, his wolf prowling close to the surface. \u201cWe also need to stipulate a permanent comm link. No dodging our calls and blaming it on nautical interference\u2014before or after. Make sure they know SnowDancer doesn\u2019t give second chances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very good point,\u201d Kenji said, swallowing a bite of what looked like cherry pie. \u201cI hear BlackSea\u2019s great at delaying things until it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll follow your lead\u2014between you, you have more experience with BlackSea than anyone else in the pack.\u201d Hawke was very aware that he either respected the strength and skills of his men and women, or he lost them to boredom and frustration. \u201cThe two of you have full authority to negotiate. Just keep me in the loop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one other thing.\u201d Riaz\u2019s expression was thoughtful. \u201cAren\u2019t you guys wondering why they\u2019re sticking their necks out now?\u201d</p><p>It was the question Hawke had earlier shelved. \u201cYeah, when they\u2019ve seen the consequences of allying with us in stark detail.\u201d As an ally, BlackSea would be expected to provide support in any future conflicts.</p><p>\u201cLast few times I met a changeling from BlackSea,\u201d Riaz said, \u201cI had the feeling something was up. Like this subtle tension under the surface.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting the same feeling.\u201d Kenji took another bite of pie, chasing it down with more soda. \u201cThey\u2019re in some kind of trouble, and whatever it is, it\u2019s making us look attractive.\u201d</p> <p>Both his lieutenants glanced at Hawke, an unasked question in their eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe continue the process.\u201d The advantages of having BlackSea as an ally were vast. \u201cNo point bringing it up now.\u201d The aquatic changelings didn\u2019t trust SnowDancer enough to tell them the truth. \u201cOnce the other pieces are in place, that\u2019s when we pin them down\u2014if they refuse to cooperate, it ends there.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t ally his people with a group that might lead them into unknown harm.</p><p>\u201cYou know, everything else aside, they\u2019re bloody fascinating.\u201d Riaz\u2019s tone held intense interest. \u201cA changeling group even other changelings don\u2019t get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreepy as hell at times, too,\u201d Kenji muttered. \u201cThose black eyes some of them have\u2014it\u2019s like looking into the face of a mako shark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be,\u201d Riaz replied with a grin. \u201cAnd damn, Kenji, do you live on a diet of junk food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sushi\u2019s in my other bento box.\u201d Unrepentant, he bit into a piece of cake.</p><p>Hawke listened to the two men discuss a couple of preliminary matters before Kenji signed off and Riaz stood. He remained concerned about the lieutenant, but as he\u2019d told Riaz, he knew lone wolves. He\u2019d give the other man a little more time. The one positive in the situation was that Riaz had come home, and he\u2019d stayed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a look at the contract tonight,\u201d the other male now said, glancing at his watch. \u201cI\u2019m due to call Pierce in a few minutes\u2014he said he\u2019d be up late.\u201d</p><p>Pierce was the lone wolf who had taken over Riaz\u2019s duties in Europe. \u201cTell him to keep his nose clean or I\u2019m putting him on rotation to Siberia.\u201d Unlike Riaz, Pierce was a flirt\u2014his face had been introduced to more than one jealous male fist.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019d have WhiteSteppe to deal with,\u201d Riaz said with a grin, naming the sole wolf pack in Siberia. \u201cThey\u2019d probably declare war on us after he seduced away some lieutenant\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Laughing as the other man left, Hawke nodded at the teenager who\u2019d just come to the doorway. \u201cHere to grab the dishes, Silvia?\u201d</p><p>A shy smile. \u201cYes.\u201d She quickly gathered them up, no sign remaining of the injuries she\u2019d suffered in a severe fall.</p><p>\u201cHow are your sessions with Ava going?\u201d he asked, knowing the maternal female had taken Silvia under her wing.</p><p>\u201cEverything she teaches me,\u201d the teenager said, \u201cit fits. Like I already kind of knew it. I wanted to ask if I could maybe have more time with her?\u201d</p><p>Shyness or not, there was strength there, Hawke thought, warm and strong. \u201cMention it to Nell,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019ll work something out.\u201d</p><p>As Silvia left with another small smile, Hawke recalled the note Nell had sent him this morning. Picking it up from his desk, he considered how to deal with that particular situation. He should make Riley handle it\u2014it was his damn fault for putting ideas in the juveniles\u2019 hormone-drenched heads. The thought cheered him up for a second, but he knew this was a task for an alpha, so he sucked it up and made the call. \u201cYou at the cabin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lucas answered. \u201cBring some of Aisha\u2019s chocolate pie for Sascha if you\u2019re heading this way. As far as my chocoholic is concerned, it\u2019s ambrosia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for Sascha darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t work now that you\u2019re mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Hawke hung up, then called Aisha to arrange the pie\u2014the cook adored how Sascha craved her baking, so it was a mutual love affair. Poking his head into Riley\u2019s office after picking it up, he told the lieutenant where he\u2019d be if needed. \u201cDo you know where Sienna is?\u201d He could sense her through the mating bond, track her if need be, but he\u2019d made a promise to himself that he would only ever do that in an emergency. Never did he want his mate to resent the bond between them, to see it as a leash or a cage.</p><p>Riley brought up the roster. \u201cShe\u2019s got study time, so I\u2019m guessing the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Even with a couple of interruptions by packmates wanting to talk, it didn\u2019t take long for Hawke to walk over to the den library, where he found his mate with her head downbent over a piece of paper on which she was writing formulas that made his brain ache. Physics and math texts lay open on several large datapads around her, and the small computer she\u2019d signed out was running what appeared to be a complex equation.</p><p>Putting his hands on either side of her desk from behind her, he nuzzled a kiss to the sensitive spot below her ear, the autumn and spice of her calming and invigorating his wolf at the same time. \u201cMs. Sienna Lauren Snow,\u201d he teased, \u201cwhat\u2019re you doing working on something as archaic as paper?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>A HINT OF color on her cheekbones. \u201cIt helps me think.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, he made a mental note to buy her a ream he\u2019d seen at the little stationery store next to the shop that made the mechanical toys he collected\u2014if he recalled right, the paper was specially formatted for the type of calculations she was doing. \u201cHow much do you have left to do today?\u201d He knew she was working on an extra-credit project to gain early entry into an advanced course on thermodynamics\u2014the behavior of energy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sienna wasn\u2019t certain the information would help her understand the cold fire that lived within her, but it couldn\u2019t do any harm. Knowledge, he thought, gave her a control that had so often been stolen from her life.</p><p>\u201cA couple of hours,\u201d she now said, tipping up her head, her hair catching on his shirt, \u201cbut I can do that tonight. I could do with a break.\u201d</p><p>He tapped her nose with his finger. \u201cCome on then. I\u2019m going to see Lucas\u2014you can visit with Sascha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, great! I haven\u2019t cuddled Naya since several days before the mating ceremony.\u201d She quickly stacked the datapads neatly in her cubicle, then gathered up and put her computer and notes away in the attached locker. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d</p> <p>They were halfway to the garage when Toby ran up to them, a small backpack slung over one lanky shoulder. \u201cAre you going out? Can I come?\u201d he asked, pushing back hair that wasn\u2019t anywhere close to the cardinal night-sky of his eyes. Habit, Hawke thought, wolf grinning at the memory of the haircut he\u2019d given the boy.</p><p>Sienna reached out to straighten his collar. \u201cYou complete your kitchen chores?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did,\u201d Hawke answered to Toby\u2019s grin. \u201cBrought me some food not long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI even finished my homework,\u201d the boy added, and got the permission he\u2019d requested to join them. Smiling, he fell in beside them. \u201cWe got out of school early today, and we don\u2019t have to start till after ten tomorrow because we have a night class.\u201d Toby all but vibrated with excitement. \u201cElias and Sam are going to teach us how to track in the dark. It\u2019s going to be real late, when everything\u2019s quiet.\u201d</p><p>Hawke remembered those classes from his own youth, the memories poignant ... because his lieutenant father had been one of the teachers. Looking at Toby\u2019s eager face, it seemed impossible that he\u2019d ever been that young, but his wolf vividly recalled stalking through the nocturnal whispering of the forest, trying to be quiet, so quiet. It made him proud that in spite of everything that had happened, SnowDancer\u2019s young continued to have the chance to be children, to learn and play and grow.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d Toby asked once he\u2019d finished regaling them about Eli and Sam\u2019s plans.</p><p>\u201cTo see Sascha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d Toby scrambled excitedly into the backseat of the SUV when they reached the garage. Though he was a great kid, Hawke\u2019s wolf worried about his good behavior. The boy had never once been in trouble\u2014and that was completely unheard of for a pup his age. Hawke was concerned Toby was afraid of acting out, for fear the people he loved would leave him\u2014as his mother had when she suicided.</p><p>He\u2019d spoken about it to Judd and Walker, as well as Sienna, and they were all keeping a quiet eye on the boy. However, Sascha\u2014who spent regular time with Toby, teaching him how to handle his empathic abilities\u2014had told Hawke not to worry. \u201cHe\u2019s very centered and happy. If I\u2019m a normal case as far as empaths are concerned, you\u2019ll have more trouble with him around fourteen to sixteen.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t consciously understand it then of course, but my abilities went hypersensitive about that time. I used to swing from anger to joy to frustration within the space of a few minutes.\u201d The cardinal had given him a wry smile. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been so afraid of being rehabilitated, I\u2019d have been hell to handle.\u201d</p><p>Toby, Hawke thought, didn\u2019t have to fear that he\u2019d be punished for having emotions by being sentenced to the psychic brainwipe, didn\u2019t have to worry that his personality would be erased in an act of brutality. And when adolescent angst hit, whether or not it was exacerbated by his empathic abilities, he\u2019d have the necessary support, love, and discipline to come out of it stronger on the other side.</p> <p>Now, listening to the boy chatter to Sienna, Hawke\u2019s wolf stretched in contentment. He had a family of his own again, he thought, the realization still so new that it was a kick to the gut each time. As alpha, everyone in SnowDancer was part of his family, but it wasn\u2019t the same as having people who were his.</p><p>\u201cToby,\u201d he said during a lull in the conversation, \u201care you dating yet?\u201d</p><p>Toby\u2019s face went bright red in the rearview mirror. \u201cUm, er, no.\u201d</p><p>Hawke had guessed as much from what he\u2019d seen at the mating ceremony, but the kid was heading toward thirteen. He\u2019d obviously noticed the opposite sex, even if he wasn\u2019t ready to take the next step. \u201cBut you know some of the older kids who are, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Toby leaned forward, stretching his safety belt. \u201cIn my soccer team mostly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of them talk about the leopard girls?\u201d</p><p>Sienna laughed. \u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes.\u201d He glanced at Toby in the rearview mirror again. \u201cToby?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, yeah.\u201d A quiet hesitation. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get anyone in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t.\u201d He\u2019d had a chat with the over-eighteens about inter-pack flirting, so they knew what was expected of them as far as acceptable behavior. However, if the younger age groups were starting to socialize, both packs needed a more concrete policy. \u201cI think definite rules would help everyone.\u201d</p><p>Toby\u2019s nod was hard enough that Hawke caught it in his peripheral vision. \u201cNo one\u2019s dating or anything,\u201d the boy said, \u201cbut I think some of them want to\u2014except they\u2019re kind of scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Hawke said.</p><p>\u201cThey think that maybe they\u2019ll do something wrong and the leopards will get mad and it\u2019ll hurt the alliance. It\u2019s not just the boys.\u201d</p><p>No more dodging the bullet, Hawke realized, they had to formulateinter-pack guidelines and quickly\u2014because while DarkRiver and SnowDancer were both predatory packs, there were subtle differences between them that adults appreciated, but that could land the young from both sides in hot water unless they knew to follow a few basic rules. \u201cThanks, Toby.\u201d He\u2019d suggest a working group made up of maternal females from both SnowDancer and DarkRiver when he brought up the subject with Lucas.</p><p>A tug along the mating bond.</p><p>Wolf pricking its ears, he glanced at Sienna. \u201cYou called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s at least one seriously developing relationship in the over-eighteens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNames?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to show my face to my friends if I told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSienna.\u201d</p><p>Another message along the mating bond, this one with a nuanced depth of emotion. His wolf, unused to defiance, blinked, shook his head. And he realized his mate was reminding him that he wasn\u2019t her alpha, never would be. Gritting his teeth, he snarled. \u201cI hate that rule.\u201d Not the truth, but at times like this, it sure as heck irritated him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we need it.\u201d Sienna leaned across to nip affectionately at his jaw.</p><p>From behind them, Toby said, \u201cI like being around you guys. You\u2019re happy deep inside even when you fight.\u201d</p><p>Wolf and man in satisfied agreement with Toby, Hawke tangled his hand with Sienna\u2019s, lifting it to his lips and snapping his teeth. Her startled yelp made Toby laugh.</p><p>My family.</p><p>SEVERAL hours after her breakdown by the waterfall, with the sky turning a post-sunset smoky gray, Adria finally walked into the den. Her throat was so raw her voice sounded akin to a croak when she entered the infirmary. \u201cI need to look and sound human for a meeting at eight.\u201d</p><p>Lara\u2019s perceptive gaze saw too much, but the healer didn\u2019t ask prying questions. \u201cOpen.\u201d A cool spray hit the back of Adria\u2019s throat. \u201cThat\u2019ll take care of the voice.\u201d</p><p>Adria stroked her fingers over her neck. \u201cAlready feels better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs for your eyes\u2014\u201d Lara pointed to a patient room. \u201cLie down and I\u2019ll put a gel pack on your face. You have two hours before the meeting. I\u2019ll wake you when it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to shower first.\u201d Her bones, her skin, everything hurt.</p><p>Lara found her a change of clothing from the supplies kept in the infirmary. \u201cThrough there.\u201d</p><p>Stripping off inside the small shower, she allowed the hot spray to pummel her body until Lara knocked on the door. \u201cI have the gel pack.\u201d</p><p>Adria got out of the shower, dried off, and dressed before she lay down on one of the beds, needing the armor of clothing after the nakedness caused by her emotional breakdown. Lara\u2019s wild corkscrew curls and fox brown eyes were the last things she saw before the coolness of the gel pack covered her puffy eyelids and cheeks.</p><p>The dreams took her under soon afterward.</p><p>Strong arms, a heavy male body, eyes of a brown so pale they shimmered gold, the night filled with the sounds of harsh breaths and hands sliding over sweat-slicked skin. When he flipped her onto her front, she waited in quivering anticipation.</p><p>Hot breath against her cheek, a big hand sliding under her body to close over one of her breasts with blatant possessiveness, the hard ridge of his erection insistent against her lower back. She attempted to arch upward, demand more, but was pinned down by his body.</p><p>A shift, his fingers brushing her unbound hair off her neck.</p><p>His weight lifting.</p><p>She rose toward him in silent invitation.</p><p>His cock and his teeth sank into her at the same instant.</p><p>Jerking awake, she pulled off the gel pack to see that Lara had closed the door to her room, leaving her in blessed privacy. It was seven fifteen according to her watch, so she had a little more time.</p><p>Allowing herself a shudder of bone-deep pleasure, she stretched, her arms above her head, her feet pointed. But her mind replayed not the erotic dream, but her conversation with Riaz after they\u2019d spoken to Tamsyn\u2014and, though it made her wolf stiffen, the way he\u2019d held her beside the waterfall. The man she\u2019d glimpsed that morning, and the one who\u2019d cared enough to put his arms around a packmate who was hurting, he was dangerous, someone who spoke to her soul beyond the primitive tug of sex.</p><p>The way he\u2019d rubbed his cheek against her hair, attempting to give comfort though she\u2019d taken none ... she\u2019d never have expected such rough tenderness from the abrasive, angry man she\u2019d first encountered. And he was loyal, so much so that he was destroying himself in his fight not to betray a mate who was forever lost to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No woman, Adria thought with a prickling sense of unease, would be immune to such a man.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>KALEB TOOK THE printed documents Silver held out, relating to a business arrangement between him and the BlackEdge wolves. \u201cAny issues?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. They\u2019ve agreed to the changes you requested.\u201d She glanced at her datapad, looked up. Hesitated.</p><p>Such hesitation was unusual for the ice-blonde who had been his aide since before he became a Councilor, but Kaleb had an excellent idea of the reason behind it. \u201cYou\u2019re wondering why I would subcontract any type of security to the wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You have the Arrows, and your own men. You don\u2019t need BlackEdge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have certain unique skills,\u201d he said, scanning the first page of the contract as he did so, his mind taking in the data at a speed that, when Silver first started working for him, had caused her to believe he wasn\u2019t actually reading. He was. His mind processed each word as he swept his eye over it, embedded it in his memory.</p><p>Flipping the page, he continued. \u201cEven Psy can be tracked by scent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Silver said, \u201cbut changelings can\u2019t evade a telepathic sweep.\u201d</p><p>Kaleb glanced up. \u201cA weakness only if the Psy in question is aware he or she is being stalked. Many of our race ignore any skill or ability beyond their own.\u201d</p><p>A longer pause, and he could almost hear her mind working methodically through his words. It was what made her such a good aide. He didn\u2019t trust her\u2014he didn\u2019t trust anyone, and Silver\u2019s first loyalty was to the powerful Mercant family, but he knew she wouldn\u2019t betray him so long as he had her respect.</p><p>For the majority of the time since he\u2019d become aware of them, he\u2019d believed the Mercants were swayed solely by power and wealth\u2014of which Kaleb had amassed a great deal. However, after monitoring them for years, he\u2019d seen multiple Mercant family members remain with failing companies until there was no chance of salvage. He\u2019d also seen them betray wealthier employers if the price was right. It had led him to revise his earlier conclusions.</p><p>Power and money might purchase a Mercant\u2019s skills, but earn their cold-eyed respect and they would not only become mute when it came to your secrets, they would also stand fast in the face of trouble. In the past year, Kaleb knew he\u2019d moved onto the very exclusive list of people the Mercants would not sell out.</p><p>Their connections and abilities, added to that of the Arrows, brought him another step closer to taking total control of the Net. Of course, there had always been a second option when it came to the Net, one he hadn\u2019t yet discarded. It all depended on the outcome of his search.</p> <p>\u201cYou are correct, Councilor,\u201d Silver said at last, her voice cool, clear, flawless. \u201cDo you need me to collate data on the individual you\u2019re tracking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He had long ago discovered and memorized every shred of available data on the one person he searched for with remorseless persistence.</p><p>Scanning the penultimate page of the contract, he indicated for Silver to wait. Thirty seconds later, he was done. Picking up a pen, he signed the document in triplicate and passed it across the desk. \u201cTell BlackEdge I have no need of their services at present.\u201d The wolves would serve their purpose after he\u2019d located his target\u2014because that target was highly likely to refuse his hospitality. And in this case, a psychic leash was not a viable option.</p><p>Of course, Selenka Durev, the BlackEdge alpha, wouldn\u2019t agree to hunt just anyone, but after years of meticulous research, Kaleb understood the finest details of how the pack functioned. If and when the time came, he\u2019d get what he wanted. No one would be permitted to stand in his way.</p><p>\u201cSir,\u201d Silver said after double-checking he\u2019d signed and initialed all the required places in the contract, \u201cabout Henry Scott.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d asked her to keep her ears open for any information on the Councilor who hadn\u2019t been seen since Sienna Lauren\u2019s X-fire decimated the Pure Psy army. \u201cIs he alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly according to unsubstantiated rumors\u2014those could be a strategic attempt by Pure Psy to bolster their membership. Without Henry\u2019s backing, the group has negligible power.\u201d</p><p>Hmm ... \u201cThere\u2019s a man named Andrea Vasquez. Thirty years of age.\u201d It was the DarkMind that had brought him the name of Henry\u2019s general. \u201cWhat do you have on him?\u201d he asked, though he\u2019d already done his own research. However, the Mercants had a way of knowing things no one else did.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me a moment.\u201d</p><p>He gave a curt nod. Having finished finalizing a memo in the interim, he put it aside for Silver to deal with, and turned in his chair. The crystal clear floor-to-ceiling wall looked out over the busy square below, black-garbed commuters scurrying to work, their heads downbent, breaths frosting the morning air.</p><p>His mind catalogued the visual intake, but it was an automatic act, his concentration on the psychic search he\u2019d been running continuously in the back of his mind for years. Except now, he utilized every spare minute to run it in the foreground\u2014because he was close. Very, very close. Enough that he might make a mistake if he didn\u2019t move with utmost stealth.</p><p>Alerted by the psychic reminder, he paused, reworked his search algorithm to halt at the first sign of a trip wire or sensor. By the time Silver walked back into his office, he was facing his desk once more, even as his mind hummed with a task that would\u2019ve taken the full attention of most normal cardinals.</p><p>Kaleb had never been normal. Not in any way.</p><p>\u201cVasquez,\u201d Silver began, after taking a seat opposite his desk, \u201cis a Gradient 8.3 telepath who was placed into Arrow training as a child. However, he was deemed unfit for the squad at age fourteen and reassigned to a regular black ops unit where he served with distinction until his apparent death.\u201d</p><p>All of which correlated with Kaleb\u2019s own findings. \u201cWet work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot on file, but given the nature of his psychological evaluation, it\u2019s a reasonable assumption that he was used for close-contact assassinations.\u201d</p><p>Kaleb had no doubts about Vasquez\u2019s status as a trained killer\u2014Henry had never liked getting his hands dirty. \u201cWhen did he fall off the grid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight years ago. Death verified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d It was the only way to vanish outright from the Net. \u201cLet me guess\u2014an accident that left no remains but for a fragment large enough to provide DNA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe crushed and partially burned remnants of the smallest finger from his left hand. Easy enough to replace with a prosthetic.\u201d</p><p>And speaking of a man dedicated enough to mutilate himself.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been seen, or DNA typed, since then.\u201d His aide tapped the screen of her organizer to bring up several images she turned toward him. \u201cHowever, since you brought up his name in relation to Henry Scott, I took the liberty of going through the surveillance images of Henry taken during the six months before his disappearance. Vasquez isn\u2019t present in any of them.\u201d</p><p>That, Kaleb knew, meant nothing. The man was a trained ghost. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely he looks anything like he did eight years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree, but,\u201d Silver continued, earning her paycheck with the next words she spoke, \u201cit appears that, prior to his disappearance, Henry was making regular six-figure-sum deposits into an account in the Caymans. While the account itself is untraceable, Henry tagged the payments with the initials \u2018A. V.\u2019 at his end.\u201d</p><p>Kaleb was almost expecting it, that it would be such a simple thing that would destroy the wall of secrecy Vasquez had built around himself. Henry had never been good with details. \u201cYou have something further,\u201d he said, watching her bring up another file.</p><p>A slight nod, not a single strand out of place in the neat twist that was her hair. \u201cThe payments stopped after Henry\u2019s encounter with Sienna Lauren. However, it now looks as if someone is reorganizing his financial assets.\u201d Her eyes, an unusual color between blue and gray, met his. \u201cOur banking contacts were able to confirm it isn\u2019t Shoshanna.\u201d</p><p>Shoshanna was Henry\u2019s wife, the relationship a fiction to placate the human and changeling population. \u201cThat\u2019s excellent work, Silver.\u201d He didn\u2019t ask her to forward him the files\u2014Silver was his aide because she did things like that without being asked.</p><p>Rising, she held the organizer to her side. \u201cAt present, this \u2018A. V.\u2019 is a phantom the same as Vasquez, but I\u2019ve alerted my family that he has become an individual in whom you have an interest.\u201d She left without further words, the click of her heels muffled by the carpet.</p><p>Kaleb considered the possibilities. The first was that Vasquez had taken over after Henry\u2019s death and was setting himself up as the new leader of Pure Psy. However, from everything Kaleb had discovered about Vasquez, the male was not a leader. While training to be an Arrow, he\u2019d followed orders with dogged fidelity. The sole reason he\u2019d been excised from the squad was because of a psychological imbalance that made him a risk in the field, given the sensitive nature of many Arrow operations.</p><p>It must\u2019ve been a difficult decision for those in charge of the squad, as according to the classified training file Silver had just sent Kaleb, quite aside from his lethal combat abilities, Vasquez possessed a critical skill: being able to organize at the minute level. If he now had control over Henry\u2019s finances, that meant he\u2019d foreseen the need for it, had ensured he\u2019d have the necessary access.</p><p>Silver, he said after a quick telepathic knock, the reorganization of Henry\u2019s finances. Where is the money going?</p><p>Unknown. Even our best people haven\u2019t been able to track the funds. We can, however, confirm that the money isn\u2019t going to the Caymans.</p><p>No, Kaleb thought, Vasquez was no rogue.</p><p>He was simply following orders to hide the existence of his master.</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>RIAZ HADN\u2019T SEEN Adria since the waterfall, so when he ran into her on the outskirts of the Pack Circle a week later, they both froze. Her wariness was writ large across the clean lines of her face before she blinked and wiped it away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Edgy about his inability to control his touch-hunger when it came to her, he\u2019d done his best to stay the hell away. But now she stood in front of him, and though her presence was nothing simple, nothing easy, he found he couldn\u2019t simply let her pass. \u201cAre you helping with the preparations?\u201d Lara and Walker\u2019s mating ceremony wasn\u2019t for another week, but everyone was already gearing up for it.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014my trainees volunteered to do the setup.\u201d She twisted what looked like a piece of twine around her index finger, offered him a guarded smile. \u201cWalker and Lara\u2019s ceremony coming so soon after Hawke and Sienna\u2019s is going to be great for the pack.\u201d</p><p>She was, he realized, trying to make conversation\u2014distant conversation. And he knew this proud, strong woman wanted to erase the fragile tie created between them by those heartrending moments by the waterfall. Reining back the dominance within him, a part of his nature that fought to crash against her cool facade until it cracked, he glanced around. \u201cLooks like you need a hand with the tables.\u201d</p> <p>An intent look, the scent of her a lingering caress. \u201cAre you volunteering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m yours to command.\u201d Even though it would\u2019ve been far more sensible to walk away.</p><p>A hint of true warmth in the luminous blue-violet. \u201cCome on then.\u201d Picking up a hand-drawn plan, she said, \u201cLara wants the picnic tables set up on the edges of the dance area, except for this section where the band\u2019s planning to set up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d About to conscript three of the bigger boys from her crew, he wrenched himself back just before he would\u2019ve spoken. These kids were Adria\u2019s. As a lieutenant, he had to support, not undermine, her authority. \u201cWho can I have?\u201d</p><p>An inscrutable look before she put two fingers to her mouth and whistled. \u201cIsrael, Charlie, Vincent. You\u2019re with Riaz.\u201d</p> <p>After he\u2019d given the boys a quick tutorial, Riaz\u2019s team began to snap and screw together the tables and benches. Since except for the occasional event, most wolves preferred to sit or sprawl on the ground, the pack put up and broke down their outdoor furniture as needed. It ensured the forest remained as uncluttered and as untouched as possible, and with the separate components taking up very little room when stacked, storage space wasn\u2019t an issue.</p><p>From what he\u2019d glimpsed of the plan, Walker and Lara\u2014or if Riaz had to guess, Lara\u2014had decided on a night picnic, followed by a jazz dance. Soft glowing lights in all the shades of the rainbow would ring the area, the festivities kicking off soon after sunset. The early start made sense, since Walker had a young daughter and was basically Toby\u2019s dad as well.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be beautiful,\u201d Adria said to him as he wiped his forearm across his perspiration-damp forehead a couple of hours later. \u201cSuit who Walker and Lara are as a couple.\u201d</p><p>Riaz had sent the boys off a few minutes earlier, when Adria dismissed the rest of her crew, and was now completing the final table with her holding the boards in place. \u201cThe check marks on the plan,\u201d he said, twisting a rivet into place. \u201cI couldn\u2019t figure out what they were.\u201d</p><p>Adria\u2019s sudden laugh was husky and uninhibited. \u201cGiant butterflies\u2014Marlee\u2019s contribution to the decorations. Sienna and Brenna have been conscripted into the task force.\u201d</p><p>Man and wolf both chuckled. \u201cWalker Lauren is not exactly the butterfly type.\u201d The lone wolf in Riaz had recognized the other man as dangerous from the first.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good dad.\u201d Adria consulted the plan, made him move the table a few feet to the left. \u201cThat\u2019s it. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Glancing up at the orange glow of the early evening sky, he said, \u201cI might jog down to the stream, take a dip.\u201d He needed to chill the embers in his gut, a dark, hot flame.</p><p>Adria frowned. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was one nearby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about a ten-minute jog.\u201d He described the sector, but the lines between her eyebrows didn\u2019t disappear. \u201cCome with me,\u201d he said, clenching his abdomen against the continuing impact of her presence. \u201cIt won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>Her reawakened wariness betrayed itself in the finest flicker of tension across her lashes, but Adria was a SnowDancer soldier. She gave a small nod. \u201cLet\u2019s pack up everything here first.\u201d</p><p>That done, Riaz led her into the trees and toward the secluded area where the hidden stream widened into a cold, clear pool half hidden by the gnarled roots of two ancient trees before snaking away and underground again. Though his wolf knew Adria wasn\u2019t his mate and the craving confused it, it clawed at him, wanting to lick up the taste of her. As a result, his jaw was a painful line by the time they reached their destination.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder I missed it,\u201d Adria said, stepping in front of him and to the water\u2019s edge. \u201cIt\u2019s literally tucked between...\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hear the rest of what she said, his eyes locked on the bare skin of her nape, her braid having slid over her shoulder. His hand curved around that nape before he was aware of moving. She wrenched away, her eyes slamming into him, bright cobalt touched with purple. For an instant, he froze, but then his wolf roared to the surface and he knew he\u2019d been fooling himself about his ability to resist her.</p> <p>THE electric charge in those eyes gone a vivid wolf gold raised every hair on Adria\u2019s body. \u201cNo.\u201d Not even if the rough heat of contact had rocked a lightning bolt through her. \u201cI told myself I\u2019d never again invite you into my bed and I meant it.\u201d</p><p>Riaz flinched. \u201cI\u2019m doing the inviting.\u201d</p><p>Bruised pride made her want to repudiate him as he\u2019d repudiated her, but if being with Martin had taught her one thing, it was that her pride could be a terrible weakness. \u201cYou\u2019ll just hate me for it.\u201d And she\u2019d had enough of a man\u2019s hatred.</p><p>Shuddering, Riaz stalked forward to cup her cheeks in his hands. Startled at the tender hold, she didn\u2019t jerk away when he bent to press his forehead to her own. \u201cNo.\u201d A hot breath on her lips, his hands warm and callused on her face. \u201cIt\u2019s on me.\u201d Raw, his soul stripped bare. \u201cI can\u2019t carry on as I have been doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m the bitter pill?\u201d Even as she said that, part of her resonated with the tumult of need and pain tearing him apart.</p><p>\u201cAdria\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A finger pressed to the firm curves of his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re right. You need to make a clean break ... and so do I.\u201d She gave him that piece of herself so this wounded wolf would know he wasn\u2019t the only one going into this with the most painful of motivations. It wasn\u2019t simply about the sex any longer, wasn\u2019t simply about assuaging the skin hunger that haunted them both. It was about saying good-bye to a dream that had never had a chance. \u201cBut,\u201d she whispered, forcing herself to hold the potent dominance of a gaze that was pure wolf, \u201cyou have to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d No hesitation, even if the words were jagged as broken stone. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for me in the past.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she thought, the past was forever gone, for both of them. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>His eyes glowed wild and beautiful in her vision as he dipped his head, stole her breath. She let her lids flutter shut, knowing that regardless of what happened after this, whether they remained lovers or walked away, one thing she would never, ever be able to change\u2014that she was the first woman to lead him into betrayal.</p><p>A dull ache, an accepted pain.</p><p>Then her wolf came to life inside her body, and the thought fractured under a chaos of sensation. Wrapping her arms around his neck, she met the fever of his kiss, her bones molten with passion. Yet ... there was a hesitancy to them that hadn\u2019t been present before, and Adria wondered if their time had passed. A twisting in her chest. A hurt that was deeper. More dangerous. But when she made as if to pull back, the growl that rumbled out of Riaz\u2019s throat was a primal thing.</p><p>His hand closed over her breast, his mouth sucking on the pulse in her neck almost before she processed the fact he\u2019d taken her to the grass, the earth still holding the sun\u2019s warmth. Any thought of retreating fragmented, the hunger inside her a wild craving. Clawing at his T-shirt, she heard something tear. He snarled against her, thrusting one hand under her own tee to push up her bra and spread his fingers over the bare flesh of her breast, cupping and shaping.</p><p>\u201cOh God!\u201d Arching into the firm, confident touch, she tore at his T-shirt until it was in pieces around them, his big, muscled body rising over her own, his mouth busy on her lips, her jaw, her neck.</p><p>His skin was a shade of burnished brown, warm and beautiful, her pleasure at touching him\u2014at last\u2014almost painful. When he shoved up her T-shirt and lowered his head to her breast, her womb clenched in anticipation. His breath on her skin ... the hot suction of his mouth. Twisting wildly, she fisted her hand in his hair, attempting to pull him off. The pleasure, oh God, the vicious pleasure was too much, her body too sensitive.</p><p>He used his teeth.</p><p>Crying out, she was bewildered at the sudden cold on her damp flesh. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d An instant later, he was unzipping her jeans, pulling them off, along with her boots. She felt something rip, knew her panties were gone. When he unzipped and moved between her thighs, she spread them against the heavy intrusion, ready until her skin ached.</p><p>A single hard thrust and he was seated deep inside her, the thickness of him a pulsing brand.</p><p>She froze for a minute, her body stunned at the almost violent possession. Long unused muscles ached, but below all that was need. Such naked, raw need. Rising toward him, she met eyes glowing against the dusk. She wasn\u2019t the least surprised by the warning growl, or by the hand he fisted in her hair to arch her neck. The bite along the sensitive slope where her neck flowed into her shoulder was hard enough to sting, hard enough to push her over.</p><p>Even as she came with a scream, he pounded into her with such wild fury, the feel of him reverberated through her very bones. A brutal word in a masculine voice so harsh, it was almost unrecognizable. Her internal muscles spasming in erotic response. His hand clenching on her breast. The primal heat of him spilling into her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>RIAZ lay on the grass, so angry with himself that he couldn\u2019t look at Adria. But he could sense her pushing her bra and T-shirt back down into place. She didn\u2019t rise to find her jeans, and he wondered if they were even in one piece. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d His voice was coated with gravel.</p><p>A pause. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never hurt a woman like that.\u201d He knew damn well she had bruises, and that bite on the smooth curve of her shoulder wasn\u2019t going to disappear anytime soon.</p> <p>Adria sighed, stretching out under the twilight colors of the sky. \u201cI wasn\u2019t complaining, Riaz, and I\u2019m strong enough to have gutted you if you\u2019d been doing anything I didn\u2019t want you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Adria.\u201d He lifted himself up on one elbow to glare at her, his body still pumped with adrenaline. \u201cYou deserve more than a fuck in the grass.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened.</p><p>He went to say something else, lost the thought when his eyes fell on half-parted lips. Kiss-bruised and lush, her mouth was the most erotic temptation, the need inside him nowhere near sated by their frantic coupling. Breath coming in harsh gasps, he managed to get out a single word, the only question that mattered, \u201cAdria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Permission.</p> <p>Promising himself he would give her tenderness this time, even if it killed him, he sucked on her lower lip, played his tongue across the part, but didn\u2019t push for entry. Instead, he licked and tasted and teased as he should have done earlier ... until her hands landed on his shoulders, her claws releasing just enough to prick his skin in silent female demand.</p><p>Smiling, he thrust one jean-clad thigh between her own and pushed up. She hissed. Breaking the kiss at once, he reached down to stroke one hand over her calf, her leg raised and bent at the knee. \u201cSore?\u201d Hardly surprising since he\u2019d shoved into her with all the finesse of the average eighteen-year-old.</p><p>She nodded, lifting her fingers to his mouth. He held position and let her explore. When she tugged him back down, he claimed a kiss that was all tongue, deep and wet and an unashamed taste of the things he wanted to do to her, before removing his thigh and shifting so that he was on the bottom. \u201cI think,\u201d he said, holding her steady with his hands on her waist as she pushed herself up to straddle him, \u201cit\u2019s my turn to take the pounding.\u201d</p><p>ADRIA was caught by the playful smile tugging at Riaz\u2019s lips, the harsh angles of his face relaxed to reveal an intoxicatingly attractive male\u2014one who was playing with her just a little ... but coming from a lone wolf...</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Riaz said when she didn\u2019t move, his head angled in a way that told her his wolf remained very much near the surface.</p><p>Leaning forward, she brushed his hair off his forehead. She knew it was a tender move, one that went beyond sex, but she needed to do it. The truth was, no matter what she\u2019d said to him that day at the training run, no matter what she\u2019d tried to convince herself because it hurt too much to do otherwise, she wasn\u2019t a woman who could ever have sex for sex\u2019s sake. It wasn\u2019t in her.</p> <p>Home and hearth and family, that\u2019s what you\u2019re built for.</p><p>Words spoken by Tarah long ago, so long ago that her sister had probably forgotten. Adria hadn\u2019t. That woman continued to exist inside of her, and in spite of the cracks in her heart, she still wanted a family of her own; a home filled with love; a man who adored her and who she could adore in return. This lieutenant who held her with warm, strong hands, his heart already given to another, wasn\u2019t the one with whom she would ever fulfill that dream, but that didn\u2019t mean their joining had to be a cold, hard thing.</p><p>Riaz didn\u2019t pull away from the gentle touch, and one of the cracks deep within her healed a tiny fraction. \u201cLet\u2019s be friends,\u201d she whispered to the golden-eyed man who watched her with such predatory focus, the wolf in his eyes.</p><p>His hands flexed on her hips. \u201cI can\u2019t be platonic friends with you, Adria.\u201d Not a rejection, just a blunt truth from male to female, wolf to wolf.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Now that they\u2019d touched, the need in her had only grown stronger.</p><p>Thumbs stroking gently over the curve of her hip. \u201cFriends who share intimate skin privileges then?\u201d A quiet clarification. \u201cDo you think we can be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d But she understood why Riaz hesitated, though it was clear to her he needed a friend as well as a lover. \u201cI\u2019ll take you as you are,\u201d she promised, wanting him to understand that she wouldn\u2019t demand what he didn\u2019t have to give, wouldn\u2019t hurt him by reminding him of what he\u2019d lost. \u201cNo expectations. No ties. No promises.\u201d Just a friendship that might help them both heal.</p><p>Riaz caressed his hands down to her bare thighs, back up to slide under her T-shirt, the calluses on his palms scraping over her skin with a rough seduction that made her shiver. \u201cYou almost sound as if you prefer that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d No lies, she thought, not here, in this beautiful moment with the world so hushed and private around them. \u201cI\u2019ve been ... lost for a long time. I\u2019m wolf enough to want the contact with a man I\u2019m not only physically attracted to, but who I\u2019m beginning to like,\u201d she said with deep honesty, thinking of the tenderness of his kiss, of the way he\u2019d handled her trainees with both affection and discipline this afternoon, \u201cbut I need my freedom.\u201d</p><p>Despite the dreams of family she nurtured in a secret part of her soul, she knew she was damaged. Until she fixed herself, if that was even possible, she couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, steal a commitment from anyone, least of all a man who belonged to another in a way that could never be erased.</p><p>He reached up to tug the tie loose from her braid, unravel her hair. \u201cFriends.\u201d It was a promise, the wolf gold of his eyes glowing. \u201cTell me about him.\u201d</p><p>And because she understood how hard it was for a dominant male like Riaz to be vulnerable, to have her keep his secrets, she did. \u201cTo understand how it happened, you have to know the beginning.\u201d She shared how she and Martin had been apart for long periods for the first five years after they met, while Martin did a postgrad degree in England, and she focused on intensive soldier training.</p><p>\u201cMy family tends to lump all those years together, but they only saw me sporadically,\u201d she told him, thinking back to that demanding, exciting time. \u201cMy parents were posted to the other end of the territory, Tarah was busy with Evie,\u201d\u2014it made her heart clench painfully tight even now to remember how weak Evie had been as a child\u2014\u201cand Indigo was still in school in den territory, while I was in the Cascades.\u201d</p><p>Riaz nodded. \u201cThey would\u2019ve had no idea of your day-to-day life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr how insane it was. As well as the soldier training, Hawke had me taking certain college courses online.\u201d Things that had given her a grounding in basic business principles, so she could act as a sounding board for a lieutenant should it ever become necessary. \u201cI barely had time to breathe, much less start a committed relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was like that for me when I first became a lieutenant,\u201d Riaz said, his fingers moving on her skin, the slight roughness of his fingertips an exquisite caress. \u201cSteep learning curve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that was part of why I was drawn to Martin when he came home for visits, why I said yes when he asked me out on dates. He was warm, intelligent, funny\u2014he made me relax.\u201d Tainted by the darkness that had come later, everyone else seemed to remember only the bad times, but it wasn\u2019t the angry man he\u2019d become that she\u2019d fallen for.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d talk me into watching silly movies; tell jokes in this deadpan voice that would have me in stitches.\u201d But he\u2019d only shared that part of himself with those he knew well. \u201cOne thing most people don\u2019t realize is that Martin is shy, always has been. It sometimes comes across as arrogance or conceit and means he doesn\u2019t make the best first impression\u2014he didn\u2019t on my parents.\u201d</p><p>However, she\u2019d seen and liked the man behind the mask, sincerely believed her family would too, once they got to know him. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have explosive chemistry,\u201d she admitted, \u201cbut I never expected that kind of passion.\u201d Had thought her wolf too sensible for the wildfire she\u2019d seen burn so many others in the pack. \u201cI didn\u2019t go around accosting brooding lone wolves then.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s eyes warmed with quiet amusement, but he didn\u2019t interrupt.</p><p>\u201cWe were compatible in so many other ways, from our outlook on life, to our belief that loyalty was the core of a relationship, to the things that made us laugh that when he suggested we take our relationship to the next level, I said yes.\u201d Her wolf had liked Martin well enough not to interfere with the human\u2019s decision, but it had never demanded more, never hungered to tangle with Martin\u2019s own wolf ... never chosen him.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t worry about the dominance issue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInitially, yes.\u201d It had been too important a question to blow off. \u201cBut you have to realize\u2014by the time we moved in together, we\u2019d known and casually dated each other for years.\u201d Regardless of the impression others, including Tarah and Indigo, might\u2019ve formed as a result of his remoteness around strangers, not once had Martin done or said anything to make her believe he couldn\u2019t handle the fact of her dominance.</p><p>\u201cWhen I made senior soldier while we were dating, he gave me a beautiful ceremonial knife,\u201d she said, wanting Riaz to understand how she could\u2019ve made such a terrible mistake and how it might not have been a mistake at all\u2014not then. \u201cHe\u2019d bought it months ago, because he was so certain I\u2019d get the promotion. He was proud of me.\u201d</p><p>Stroking hands on her thighs, the calm watchfulness of the predator that prowled behind the captivating shade of his eyes. \u201cWhen did it start to go wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can never quite pinpoint it.\u201d The only thing she knew was that the change had bewildered her. \u201cMaybe it was the reality of living day to day with a woman whose wolf was dominant to his own, the realization that if it came down to it, I didn\u2019t need him to protect me.\u201d All she had were guesses, because the death of their relationship had been a slow, insidious thing, hard to see until it was too late. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFrom what you\u2019ve said, it sounds like he was the one who pursued you\u2014could be he felt more for you than you did for him,\u201d Riaz said quietly. \u201cWe both know you didn\u2019t love him, not as a strong female wolf should love her man.\u201d</p><p>Stricken, Adria said, \u201cWhile I was in that relationship, I gave him everything I had to give.\u201d Hadn\u2019t realized she had the capacity for wild passion, that the dark intensity she\u2019d witnessed in packmates was a part of her nature, too. \u201cIf he was unhappy, why didn\u2019t he say anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he was a weak prick,\u201d was the cold summation. \u201cI can see why he might\u2019ve reacted badly, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have any sympathy for him.\u201d</p> <p>Yes ... Martin had made his own choices, held the responsibility for them. \u201cI should\u2019ve walked away when I first began to realize he\u2019d started to resent me for my strength, but I couldn\u2019t bear to give up and prove to those who\u2019d warned me off a less dominant man that they\u2019d been right.\u201d God, she\u2019d been so stubborn, so proud.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a dominant female\u2014being bloody-minded is part of the package.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, leaned down to play her fingers through his hair once more. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve forgiven myself for that.\u201d Because underneath the pride had been the honest desire to salvage a relationship that had started out with such promise. \u201cAnd I think I would\u2019ve accepted defeat sooner and walked away, but then ... Martin saved my life.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been out in a bad storm, searching for a pup everyone thought was lost when a tree had fallen on her. It had broken her leg and dislocated her shoulder as it knocked her into a stream that had been bloated to dangerous levels, where she\u2019d hit her head on an exposed rock. Dizzied and disoriented, she\u2019d begun to gasp in water instead of air.</p><p>Having described the accident to Riaz, she said, \u201cMartin has a bone-shaking fear of the water after almost drowning as a child, but he came out into the storm because he was worried about me, and then he dove into a raging torrent to save my life.\u201d However, that wasn\u2019t the most important part of the jagged jigsaw that had been their relationship. \u201cHe got me out, but as he was pulling himself out, a huge rock smashed into him, crushing most of his ribs and doing serious damage to his organs. He was in the infirmary longer than I was.\u201d</p> <p>Riaz sat up, stroking his hands along her spine. \u201cHe used it, didn\u2019t he, to hold you?\u201d</p><p>The top of the tattoo on Riaz\u2019s left shoulder just visible to her in this position, she traced the curved lines of it. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was conscious, but yes.\u201d The pressure had been so subtle, she hadn\u2019t realized what was happening for a long time. \u201cI always had this sickening bubble of guilt inside me whenever I thought of ending it with a man who\u2019d risked everything to save me.\u201d</p><p>After the relationship did end, she\u2019d found herself unable to understand why Martin had fought to hold her even when it had become agonizingly clear they\u2019d be happier apart. But if Riaz was right, if Martin had loved her in a way she hadn\u2019t been able to reciprocate ... it explained so much, even as it didn\u2019t excuse the hurt he\u2019d caused her.</p><p>\u201cLoyalty\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d Riaz\u2019s breath warm against her skin.</p><p>\u201cNo ... but taken too far, it can become a flaw.\u201d Sliding her hands over his shoulders when his gaze darkened in knowledge, she gave a rueful smile. \u201cHindsight is always twenty-twenty, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his cheek against hers. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a bitch.\u201d</p> <p>Again, she laughed, startled at the vein of humor within the solemn wolf with the golden eyes. \u201cWell, I\u2019m done with looking back,\u201d she said, tasting the salt and citrus bite of his skin, the hint of bitter chocolate in his kiss exotic and intriguing. \u201cI\u2019m ready to live in today.\u201d</p><p>This time, their loving was an intimate dance.</p><p>Long, drugging kisses, lingering strokes of her hands over a firm chest lightly covered by a sprinkling of hair that was an erotic caress against her breasts, and a ride as deep, as slow. His body arched under her own, his tendons straining white under the dusky hue of his skin as his hands clenched on her hips.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt as beautiful, as powerfully female.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>KALEB LOOKED DOWN at the body laid out on the cold metal slab, lit by the frigid white of the morgue lights. The corpse had been discovered four hours ago, been prioritized at the highest level of importance. \u201cYour conclusions?\u201d he said to Aden. The Arrow medic\u2014trained to perform autopsies on fallen Arrows\u2014had done the task himself.</p><p>\u201cCause of death was a broken neck,\u201d Aden responded. \u201cFrom the on-scene examination, it appears he tripped and fell down the stairs.\u201d</p><p>Not an unbelievable occurrence, and nothing that would\u2019ve drawn Arrow attention, except for the fact the victim was an anchor. All anchor deaths were investigated by Arrows, even when old age was an evident factor\u2014born with the ability to merge totally into the Net, those of Designation A were too integral to its psychic fabric to risk any mistakes.</p> <p>Anchors had many functions, but their most important one was to stabilize and \u201chold\u201d the PsyNet in place. They were the reason Psy could cross the world on the psychic plane without mental stress. The death of the one who lay on the slab had caused some minor ripples, but the temporary fail-safes had come into play the instant he disappeared from the Net, ensuring no major damage. Those in the affected zone would\u2019ve experienced a faint headache at most before the network of anchors in the region realigned their spheres of influence to cover the gap.</p><p>A single death would in no way stretch the network thin, but the loss of any anchor was a cause for concern. However, only a telekinetic at the scene could\u2019ve prevented an accident that appeared to have been caused by a split-second physical error.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe the on-scene report?\u201d he asked Aden.</p><p>\u201cVasic and I both did a sweep of the premises, found nothing out of order. The footage from his private security system also proved to be clean. Theoretically, a teleport-capable Tk could\u2019ve \u2019ported in and \u2018assisted\u2019 in the fall, but why kill an anchor?\u201d It was the most crucial question. \u201cThey have no political power, and their deaths do nothing except weaken the Net.\u201d</p><p>And regardless of political affiliation, every single Psy in the Net needed the biofeedback provided by the vast mental network. Sever their Net link and those of his race died an excruciating death in minutes.</p><p>\u201cNon-Psy?\u201d Kaleb proposed.</p><p>\u201cIf there was an intruder, it would\u2019ve had to be a Tk. No other designation could\u2019ve evaded the security system.\u201d</p><p>He met Aden\u2019s gaze. \u201cJudd Lauren is a Tk outside the Net.\u201d It was a statement he made for many reasons.</p><p>\u201cJudd also has an emotional attachment to the members of his family,\u201d Aden pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to extrapolate that he wouldn\u2019t want to cause harm to the young in the Net, and there is no way to control the widespread effect of an anchor\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>Weighing all the factors, Kaleb gave a small nod. \u201cEven the most important aren\u2019t immune to accidents,\u201d he said, taking in the bruises on the body of the middle-aged man. \u201cHowever, I want no unanswered questions. Do a secondary scan of the premises, ensure your first impression was correct.\u201d</p><p>Aden said nothing, but Kaleb knew it would be done. He and the Arrows had come to an understanding\u2014but he didn\u2019t make the mistake of thinking he had their total support. The most lethal fighting force in the Net was still making up its mind about him. What the Arrows didn\u2019t realize was that Kaleb was evaluating them, too, the purpose of that evaluation nothing Aden and his men would ever guess.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>RIAZ PRESSED HIS forehead to the wall of the shower and let the water pound over him, washing away the sweat and grass stains, but doing nothing to erase the memories of the passion that had swept over him not long ago ... and of the wild, sensual woman whose lush mouth was quickly becoming a private addiction.</p><p>Shame, anger, desire, they all vied for prime position within the rigid tension that was his body. The idea of being with anyone else once he\u2019d found the woman meant to be his mate, was so anathema to everything he had ever believed, that both man and wolf were bewildered, lost. But that wasn\u2019t the only thing that had him feeling like shit\u2014regardless of what Adria had said about being with him every step of the way during their first primal coupling, he wasn\u2019t a man who mistreated women. It continued to shame him that he\u2019d been so inconsiderate with her.</p><p>A snapshot of memory, Adria\u2019s hair tumbling around him in a silken waterfall as she leaned down to suck his lower lip into her mouth, releasing it in a delicious tease of a bite. \u201cNo more guilt, Riaz.\u201d A husky order. \u201cI needed that as much as you did. We can go slow this time.\u201d</p><p>Wrenching the water to ice-cold when his cock surged at the mental replay of exactly how slow they\u2019d taken it, he grit his teeth until his wolf cried foul. Since he was about to turn blue, he got out, dried off, and pulled on a faded pair of jeans, the threads barely holding together above the left knee. A white T-shirt, socks, and boots and he was done. He ran a comb through his hair, rubbed his jaw. It scraped, the bristles hard. Since it was far too late for Adria\u2019s delicate skin, he shrugged and left it.</p><p>Heading to the small office he\u2019d been assigned, he began to go through some paperwork Pierce had asked him to look over, figuring he\u2019d grab dinner from the kitchen later, as it was only seven thirty.</p><p>However, Riley popped in his head a minute later. \u201cDinner at my place tonight.\u201d</p><p>Riaz had returned to the den because he\u2019d known he needed his pack. But after what had just happened, the painful decision he\u2019d made to forget Lisette and continue his strange, sensual friendship with Adria, his wolf raised its hackles, wanting to be left alone. \u201cThanks, but I have a lot of work.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a lie\u2014he was the lieutenant in charge of SnowDancer\u2019s international business interests, Pierce and the others under his direct command. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Riley leaned against the doorjamb, arms folded. \u201cIf you wanted to isolate yourself,\u201d he said, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t have come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push me, Riley.\u201d He could feel his claws pricking the insides of his skin.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what friends do. We\u2019re running down in ten minutes.\u201d</p> <p>Realizing he\u2019d only end up brooding if he remained behind, Riaz gave in and joined Riley, Drew, and Indigo outside the den, the sky a soft dark not yet dotted with stars. \u201cWe waiting on someone?\u201d</p><p>Riley glanced over his shoulder. \u201cHere they come.\u201d</p><p>Riaz didn\u2019t need to turn to know that Adria was part of the group. But he did so anyway, saw that Hawke walked beside her. The alpha was laughing at something Adria had said, her face turned toward his, her damp hair caught in a loose braid.</p><p>That laughter faded when her eyes fell on him, but her smile didn\u2019t.</p><p>Something hard and jagged in him eased a fraction, his wolf settling.</p> <p>And then they were moving, the pace comfortable, conversation being exchanged as they flowed through the trees. Adria and Indigo ran ahead, following Riley and Hawke, while Drew had ended up beside Riaz. It would\u2019ve been an unexpected pairing a few months ago, but he and Drew had made their peace, the other man so settled in his mating with Indigo that nothing could shake him.</p><p>A burst of feminine laughter, husky and generous.</p><p>Compelled by a woman who was becoming important to him in a way that threatened to undermine the foundations of his world, he wondered what Adria and Indigo were talking about that had them so amused, decided it was probably one of those things a man didn\u2019t want to know.</p><p>\u201cSienna\u2019s missing,\u201d he said to Drew. \u201cUnusual.\u201d Newly mated men liked to be near their women as a rule\u2014and Hawke was alpha, with the concurrent primal drives. His mate had also been in brutal danger not long ago. Continued to be, in many ways.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s training with Judd.\u201d Drew must\u2019ve done something via the mating bond, because Indigo gave him an arch look over her shoulder before returning to her conversation with Adria. Grinning, Drew added, \u201cThey\u2019ll come down together after.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t, Riaz knew, because Judd was a lieutenant that Hawke trusted the other man with his mate when the possessive urges of mating had to be running rampant through his body. \u201cShe\u2019s so young.\u201d It worried him at times, that Sienna Lauren wouldn\u2019t be able to bear the weight placed on her shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cYou saw what she did.\u201d A solemn response. \u201cThat kind of power ages a person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sienna showed no overt signs of it, but he knew she had to have paid a price for the cold fire that had saved so many SnowDancers. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, though\u2014part of me still wants to protect her.\u201d She had his respect, but that didn\u2019t mean his normal instincts were dead.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Drew admitted. \u201cDon\u2019t think that worries her\u2014the girl\u2019s tough enough to handle an alpha.\u201d</p><p>Just like the woman in front of him, Riaz thought, was more than tough enough to handle anything he threw at her, the delicacy of her scent belying a steely core that had begun to fascinate his wolf.</p><p>\u201cYou two are as slow as old ladies,\u201d Hawke said, having dropped back to join them.</p><p>Drew whistled. \u201cSounds like a challenge to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it does.\u201d Catching Drew\u2019s eye, Riaz slammed into Hawke without warning, taking the alpha to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Drew had already pulled off Hawke\u2019s boots, stripped the laces, and thrown everything in four different directions by the time the alpha managed to get past Riaz and to his feet. \u201cThose are my favorite boots!\u201d</p><p>Drew rubbed his hands. \u201cBetter find them then. Meanwhile, we\u2019ll beat your ass to Riley\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Hawke bared his teeth\u2014and the race was on, the women and Riley joining in. Riaz\u2019s wolf grinned as it ran, happy in the most uncomplicated sense. The trees whipped by at lightning speed, and they spilled into the clearing that fronted Riley\u2019s home, a graceful stone and wood chalet set halfway between DarkRiver and SnowDancer territory, less than ten minutes later ... to find Hawke and his boots waiting for them on the steps.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d Drew scowled, hands on his knees. \u201cWe need to cheat better next time!\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s eyes went night-glow. \u201cTouch my boots again and I\u2019ll have Aisha broil you for lunch.\u201d</p><p>Chest heaving, Riaz shook his head. \u201cWe should make him run one-legged.\u201d The alpha had been fast as a boy, but now he was fast. \u201cMaybe weigh him down with rocks.\u201d</p><p>Hawke leaned back on the steps, resting on his elbows. \u201cYou\u2019d still be eating my dust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh.\u201d Drew shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s a declaration of war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys!\u201d Mercy stepped out of the house. \u201cBe nice.\u201d Her amused expression changed when it landed on Riley\u2014who raced up the steps to claim a kiss, his hand large and gentle against her cheek.</p><p>Dorian and Ashaya arrived at almost the same instant, pulling up in a hover vehicle they parked at the edge of the clearing. Riaz knew the man was one of Mercy\u2019s closest friends, as well as Judd\u2019s training partner on occasion. It seemed a strange combination\u2014the former Arrow and a man who\u2019d fit right in on a surf beach\u2014but among other things, Dorian was deadly accurate with a sniper rifle.</p><p>\u201cCome on in.\u201d Riley waved everyone into the house.</p><p>They entered en mass to find the air rife with mouthwatering smells.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mercy fell back against Riley\u2019s wide chest with a dramatic sigh, the back of her hand pressed to her forehead. \u201cI slaved and slaved for you. I hope you appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>That was when a male head sporting the same distinctive red hair as Mercy\u2019s, popped out of the kitchen. \u201cI see someone\u2019s pants are on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Bas.\u201d Mercy shooed away the tall man\u2014who walked over to wrap his arm around her neck and tug her to his side in a scowling grip, as if she wasn\u2019t a sentinel with her lieutenant mate standing right there.</p><p>\u201cSay sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d Elbowing the man to free herself, Mercy made the introductions. \u201cEveryone, this is my brother, Bastien, otherwise known as a pain in the neck, and an excellent cook. Bas, these are wolves who will fall upon you and devour you if you so much as blink wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have wolf defurring tools, too,\u201d Bastien muttered before jerking his head toward the kitchen. \u201cFood\u2019s ready. Me and my serving wench will bring it out.\u201d He dragged Mercy off with a brotherly lack of concern for her insulted expression.</p><p>Riaz\u2019s gaze connected with Adria\u2019s laughing eyes, his own lips curving.</p><p>SENSING his mate\u2019s approach half an hour after the rest of them had arrived at Riley\u2019s, Hawke headed into the trees, squeezing Brenna into a hug when she appeared first. \u201cJudd sprung you from your late shift, I see.\u201d His wolf had a soft spot for this small woman who\u2019d survived a monster and come out of it sane.</p><p>\u201cMariska said she\u2019d cover.\u201d An unexpected frown. \u201cI wish she\u2019d get out more. Next time, I\u2019m bringing her.\u201d</p><p>Aware the gifted senior tech was both extremely shy and a submissive, Hawke nodded. Submissives weren\u2019t uniformly shy, not by a long shot, but when such a strong combination\u2014as in Mariska\u2019s case\u2014happened, it tended to make them timid and introverted. The pack had to be careful those wolves didn\u2019t get lost in the shuffle of their stronger, more dominant packmates. \u201cTell her we don\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t lie to my friends.\u201d</p><p>Hawke tugged on her ponytail for that smart-ass remark, just as Judd and Sienna appeared behind her. \u201cHow did you beat them down?\u201d</p><p>Brenna gave him a look of pure, haughty affront. \u201cI\u2019m a wolf.\u201d Walking over to her mate, she held out a hand. \u201cI won. Pay up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me the shortcut,\u201d Judd demanded.</p><p>Innocence in the fractured blue-brown eyes that spoke of Brenna\u2019s unwavering strength. \u201cWhat shortcut?\u201d She batted her lashes ... and shrieked as she was lifted into the air without warning. Shriek turning into delighted laughter after a second, she did a backward flip.</p><p>Beside Judd, Sienna, her hands on her hips, said, \u201cJudd, this is an inefficient use of your\u2014\u201d A startled cry as she found herself floating, too.</p><p>Grinning, Hawke walked over to rescue her, grabbing her around the hips to pull her back down to earth. \u201cThat\u2019ll teach you to sass a Tk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an X. Why does no one have any respect?\u201d she said, rubbing her nose against his as Judd and Brenna\u2014back on her feet and with her hand linked to her mate\u2019s\u2014disappeared toward the house.</p><p>He tucked her deeper into his body, his legs splayed. \u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d A warning nip on her lower lip.</p><p>Sienna nipped back. \u201cYou knew I was on my way.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he had, having allowed himself the rare luxury of keeping an eye on her through the mating bond. She\u2019d known, had understood. \u201cSo?\u201d He\u2019d permitted everyone to believe Sienna and Judd were undertaking a normal session of psychic combat, had even forced himself to remain in the den rather than going with them, so as not to raise suspicions.</p><p>In truth, Judd and Sienna, as well as Walker, had been attempting to gauge her psychic stability. The psychic \u201cvalve\u201d in Walker\u2019s mind was an external control on the X-fire, but Sienna\u2019s power remained an unknown for the most part. It was impossible to predict how it might develop and grow. None of them were just going to sit back and hope it would all work out for the best.</p><p>\u201cIt went really well,\u201d she said with a relieved smile. \u201cI\u2019m emitting energy at a constant rate, but the level\u2019s so low it\u2019s being absorbed into the SnowDancer Web without having a discernible impact on any one individual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more interested in you, baby.\u201d It infuriated him that he couldn\u2019t protect her on the psychic plane, but he had rock-solid faith in Sienna\u2019s capacity to master her incredible abilities. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy shields are airtight, and Judd says the energy transference between me and Walker is becoming smoother as our brains adapt to the process.\u201d A tender kiss, her fingers playing with the hair at his nape.</p><p>He bent his head so she could reach him more easily. \u201cAny problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to jinx it, but ... so far, so good.\u201d</p> <p>He understood why she couldn\u2019t give him a concrete answer\u2014because no one had any neat solutions for an X, much less a cardinal. But his wolf didn\u2019t panic, able to see the crimson and gold flame of her through the mating bond. Though always dangerous, it was stable. Yet in spite of that, he continued to sense a deep vulnerability and quiet fear within his mate. He hated that such fear lived in her even now, but Sienna was glad of it.</p><p>\u201cI should be afraid of my strength,\u201d she\u2019d said fiercely. \u201cIt stops me from ever becoming lazy in my control.\u201d</p><p>Hawke could follow her reasoning, accepted that she\u2019d never be able to be as carefree as other women her age, but that didn\u2019t alter his instincts when it came to her. Now, his wolf rubbed against his skin, nuzzling at her. \u201cSince when are you superstitious?\u201d he teased in an attempt to subdue the vestiges of fear and worry that lingered in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSince Evie made me watch three horror movies in a row the other night while you were on mountain patrol.\u201d Her look of faux terror made him chuckle. \u201cI missed you when you were gone. I\u2019d like to come next time if I\u2019m not on shift.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like being away from her overnight, but that particular patrol section was difficult, even for SnowDancers in wolf form. As a result, the duty was rotated between him, Riley, three of the more experienced senior soldiers, Riaz, Indigo, and a surprisingly nimble Tai. Judd could\u2019ve done it, too, but Hawke had made an alpha decision to conserve the lieutenant\u2019s telekinetic strength where possible, in case of unexpected attack or emergency. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous,\u201d he said now. \u201cIf you fall, you\u2019ll shatter your bones.\u201d Sienna\u2019s psychic power might be immense, but physically she was far more breakable than a changeling.</p> <p>Stubborn intransigence. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>He growled. \u201cYou\u2019re meant to be Psy. Be rational.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can wait at base camp while you do the sweep. See, a compromise? It\u2019s that shiny new word we\u2019re trying to learn.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>\u201cBRAT.\u201d FRUSTRATED THOUGH he was, man and wolf both laughed, delighted with the woman who was his own. \u201cI\u2019ll talk it over with Riley,\u201d he said, placing a finger on the lush fullness of her lips when they parted. \u201cRules.\u201d</p><p>Biting lightly at his finger, Sienna tugged on his hair. \u201cI hate that stupid rule.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cServes you right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley\u2019s so fair,\u201d Sienna muttered, \u201cI can\u2019t ever argue when he decides something in your favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd vice versa.\u201d It was integral to his and Sienna\u2019s relationship that Hawke not be able to use the fact he was alpha to overrule her. However, Sienna\u2019s place in the hierarchy meant the pack wouldn\u2019t accept her as a free agent. Neither would such sudden lack of discipline be good for her\u2014she\u2019d made that point herself.</p><p>\u201cJust like a wolf, I need the structure provided by the hierarchy,\u201d she\u2019d explained. \u201cIt suits the military way my mind was trained, helps me manage the X-fire.\u201d</p><p>It had been decided that Riley, the most senior person in SnowDancer after Hawke, would be the one who gave Sienna her orders as a novice soldier, and who okayed or vetoed things Hawke would normally handle for anyone else in SnowDancer. In effect, Riley acted as her alpha.</p><p>So far, it was working.</p><p>\u201cHungry?\u201d he asked as she continued to pet him with those little touches that had become integral to his existence.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I\u2019m not ready to go in yet.\u201d When she asked about his day, he told her, listened with ears pricked when she reciprocated.</p> <p>\u201cEvie wants to go on a double date.\u201d An almost wolfish amusement in her grin.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Tai say?\u201d The difference in his and Sienna\u2019s ages had worried him before they mated, but he no longer felt any guilt over claiming her, not after she\u2019d almost executed herself on the field of battle. The memory always made him incandescent with rage\u2014and certain he\u2019d made the right decision. Who else would be able to handle his smart, headstrong troublemaker?</p><p>Now, she laughed in unholy glee. \u201cTai looks appalled every time she brings it up.\u201d</p><p>Hawke was unsurprised at the young soldier\u2019s reaction, but he also understood that sweet Evie, who saw far more than most people realized, and who loved Sienna like a sister, was sending him a message with the joking idea.</p><p>The people at Riley\u2019s cabin right now were all high-ranking individuals, an utterly disparate group from Sienna\u2019s circle of friends. That didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d be uncomfortable\u2014his mate wasn\u2019t ever intimidated\u2014but this wouldn\u2019t, he realized, be the same relaxed event for her as it was for him. \u201cDouble date\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I was so looking forward to it.\u201d</p><p>He tapped her lightly on the butt, making her dig her nails into his nape. \u201cCareful,\u201d she warned. \u201cI bite, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the marks to prove it.\u201d Pressing his lips to her cheekbone, he lifted his head. \u201cI can\u2019t ever be anything but their alpha, baby.\u201d Those lines could not be blurred.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d No distress, her voice gentle, affectionate. \u201cI was teasing.\u201d</p><p>He considered Evie\u2019s silent message once more. Thought of how many changes Sienna was having to learn to handle in adapting to life as the SnowDancer alpha\u2019s mate. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, decision made, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason they can\u2019t join us tonight.\u201d They were her friends, her support structure\u2014a structure she\u2019d need more than ever as her responsibilities grew.</p><p>No matter what, Hawke had to remain alpha, but with Indigo and Adria here, as well as Sienna, Evie would feel no discomfort. As for Tai, the boy was Judd\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and sometimes trained with Dorian. He\u2019d be fine.</p><p>Sienna stilled, looking up at him with eyes gone pure ebony. \u201cSometimes, you do things that make me fall in love with you all over again.\u201d</p><p>His wolf preened. \u201cYeah? Come show me.\u201d</p><p>RIAZ was enjoying himself far more than he would\u2019ve believed possible. Having ended up on the verandah along with everyone else, a beer in hand, he grabbed another one of the little pie things Bastien had brought out.</p><p>A female groan sounded just as he was thinking that Mercy\u2019s brother, a financial whiz in real life, could make a serious go of it as a professional chef. \u201cBas, if I wasn\u2019t already mated, I\u2019d drag you into the woods right now.\u201d Indigo popped the remainder of her samosa into her mouth, leaning into her sister as they sat on the chair swing.</p><p>Bastien, perched on the balcony railing beside Drew, Dorian, and Tai, legs hooked around the wooden bars, grinned and took a sip of his own beer.</p><p>\u201cSince all of you have the bad luck to be mated or otherwise engaged\u201d\u2014Adria tucked up those long, long legs in the ragged but comfortable armchair she\u2019d claimed\u2014\u201cI guess he\u2019s all mine.\u201d</p><p>Several \u201cboos\u201d sounded, with Bastien assuring the women there was more than enough of him to go around. Riaz looked up at Mercy when she perched herself on the arm of his chair. \u201cYour brother always flirt with death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe likes to live on the edge.\u201d Placing her glass of fresh lemonade on a small card table that already held a tray of food, she braced her forearm against his shoulder. \u201cAnd he knows precisely how far he can push things. Believe it or not, he\u2019s the most well behaved of my brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour poor mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Riley crooked a finger from where he sat in another armchair. Smiling, Mercy rose in a sinuous movement and sauntered over. \u201cYou called?\u201d</p><p>Riaz had never seen that teasing look on Riley\u2019s face before. It made him feel ... not an intruder, but ... family. Pack. As for the woman with the gold-streaked eyes of intense blue-violet whose husky laughter made his wolf prick its ears, he didn\u2019t know who she was to him, but he knew that their molten intimacy in the grass had only temporarily assuaged the flame that burned between them.</p><p>MERCY watched the lights of Dorian\u2019s car fade into the trees, just as Riaz disappeared into the forest, Drew and Tai by his side, Indigo, Evie, and Adria up ahead. Judd and Brenna had left a little earlier, as they both had an early start the next day, and Bas had hitched a ride with her middle brother, Sage, who\u2019d turned up an hour ago. The final two, Hawke and Sienna, intended to take a different route to the den from Riaz\u2019s group.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sienna,\u201d Mercy called out, and when the young woman turned to look over her shoulder, said, \u201cYou know the whole \u2018let me show you a beautiful spot\u2019 line? It\u2019s the changeling version of \u2018let me show you my etchings.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Hawke slung an arm around his grinning mate and dragged her close. \u201cRiley, show your mate your own etchings so she doesn\u2019t worry about mine.\u201d</p><p>Mercy laughed at the bad-tempered snarl, leaning back into Riley\u2019s embrace. \u201cYou showed me quite a few etchings after Sienna did her nuclear battery thing,\u201d she murmured as the other couple walked into the star-dusted night.</p><p>\u201cFirst time I wore you out.\u201d Riley\u2019s lips brushed her neck, his voice a teensy bit smug.</p><p>Leopard and woman both had to admit he was entitled. \u201cToo bad the energy wave didn\u2019t cross over to me.\u201d It had proven that the connection between the SnowDancer and DarkRiver webs formed by their mating, was very much only a mating bond. Nothing else came through. As a result, after Sienna\u2019s abilities went supernova, Riley had been bursting out of his skin with energy\u2014all of it focused oh-so-sexily on Mercy\u2014while she\u2019d alternately moaned in breathless pleasure and begged for sleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The memory made her toes curl. \u201cGot any new etchings to show me?\u201d She closed her hands over his arms, loving the warm, solid feel of him. My Riley.</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact...\u201d Riley nuzzled at Mercy. \u201cWant to go for a walk first?\u201d The night was stunning as only a Sierra night could be, lit by a full moon and a million stars.</p><p>Mercy did a feline stretch in his arms. \u201cI feel too lazy after Bas\u2019s concoctions. Can I sit in your lap instead?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome here, kitty cat.\u201d Tugging her back, he took a seat in one of the large cushioned wicker chairs her parents had gifted them on their mating. Mercy immediately curled into him, her legs hanging over the arm of the chair, her head against his shoulder. Fiery curls of hair cascaded down his arm where he braced her back, the lithe muscle of her thigh warm under his other hand.</p><p>Content in a way he\u2019d rarely been before Mercy, he simply stroked her until she purred. It delighted him as it always did. \u201cI made you purr.\u201d</p><p>A lazy yawn. \u201cI\u2019m faking it.\u201d</p><p>Lips curving, he dipped his head to kiss her. It was a familiar exchange, a little private game they could play because they were utterly besotted with one another. The word \u201cbesotted\u201d had first been used by a disgusted Sage, but Riley didn\u2019t mind being besotted with Mercy. \u201cFake it some more,\u201d he said, his hand on her abdomen.</p><p>However, when she tilted back her head, a smile tugging at her lips, he froze, caught by a delicate softness to her features that struck him out of nowhere. Mercy wasn\u2019t a vulnerable woman\u2014and yet at that instant, his wolf roared to the surface, wanting to protect, to shelter, to take care of her. The urge was so violent that he fisted a hand in her hair, the one on her abdomen flexing until all his tendons stood out in stark relief.</p> <p>\u201cRiley? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Sitting up from her languorous position, Mercy ran her hands through his hair, over his nape, down his chest.</p><p>Petting him. She was petting him in an effort to comfort.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me, tough guy.\u201d Open concern, her eyes night-glow.</p><p>Riley tried to fight the primitive impulse, only to feel it shoving back with so much urgency he stood no chance. Shocked, he shuddered as the wolf took over, but instead of using that control to initiate the shift, it retreated ... leaving him with a luminous piece of knowledge, a brilliant faceted jewel that almost blinded.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d he whispered, looking down. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand.\u201d It was an apology to his wolf. \u201cIt\u2019s my first time.\u201d</p><p>Mercy tugged on his hair. Hard. \u201cYou\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p> <p>He looked up, wonder in every heartbeat. \u201cGuess what?\u201d</p><p>Mercy\u2019s gaze dropped to where he\u2019d spread his hand. She went motionless, eyes huge. \u201cRiley, are we\u2014Do you\u2014How\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he answered. \u201cWe are, and I know because a changeling male always knows before anyone else when it comes to his mate.\u201d He\u2019d heard the healers hypothesize that the realization was caused by a minute change in a woman\u2019s scent, a change so subtle no one else would sense anything, but that the wolf in Riley had scented at once.</p><p>Mercy\u2019s eyes held equal parts shock, and delight. \u201cRiley.\u201d</p><p>He felt his lips stretch even wider. \u201cI think we need to celebrate with some brand-new etchings.\u201d</p><p>His cat\u2019s laugh was surprised and warm and the sound of home. \u201cIt\u2019s your etchings that got us into this position.\u201d Stealing a kiss when he bent his head, she wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cI\u2019m so happy.\u201d It was a conspiratorial whisper.</p><p>Cuddling her tight, he said, \u201cCan I tell everyone?\u201d</p><p>AFTER Drew tugged Indigo away somewhere a small distance from the den, Tai and Evie decided to stop at the waterfall, leaving Riaz and Adria to make the rest of the journey alone. Neither of them spoke, and it wasn\u2019t quite a comfortable silence, but it wasn\u2019t the edgy anger that had existed between them for so long either.</p> <p>The night air a cool kiss against their skin, they passed into the White Zone not long afterward, and then they were at the den. Instead of splitting with her, he walked her to her room. Reaching the door to her quarters, he waited for her to unlock it, but made no move to cross the threshold. She, in turn, made no move to invite him in, her eyes dark with a dawning awareness that something had changed, the bonds they\u2019d forged that afternoon deeper than they should be. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night.\u201d Waiting until she closed her door, he walked back out of the den, his wolf needing the quiet freedom of the night. Stripping in a secluded area, he put his clothes carefully in the hollow created between two pines that had grown into each other, and shifted.</p><p>Agony and ecstasy, pleasure and pain.</p><p>The black wolf that lived within him took form in sparks of color, its nose picking up a thousand unique tendrils of scent. Shaking its head to clear it after the shift, it began to run, disturbed by its own confusion. All its life, the wolf had been the one who felt nothing but certainty, been alternately amused and frustrated by the man\u2019s way of complicating things.</p><p>Not now. Now it asked the man for clarity ... and together they ran, the wind ruffling through the pitch black of the wolf\u2019s fur, the forest a familiar playground, the trees watchful sentinels. The freedom of it was intoxicating, until the wolf could almost forget the strange turmoil within. But when the sky grew lighter, and its steps slower, it knew the time had come to return home. The wild called to both parts of Riaz, yet something drew man and wolf to the den, the tug so deep that he rubbed a fisted hand over his heart after shifting.</p><p>Time to get some sleep, he thought, and having dressed, began to walk toward his quarters ... then suddenly, he was tracking another scent. Delicate and strong. Fragile and steely. A puzzle that suited the enigma of a woman for whom the need in him burned hot and intense. He caught up to her just as she reached her door.</p><p>A pregnant pause, last night repeated.</p><p>Not turning, she pushed through.</p><p>Entering behind her, he shut the door, turned the lock.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>HIS CRAVING FOR her, a craving that hadn\u2019t abated even a fraction, roared to the surface when she reached down and pulled off the T-shirt she\u2019d been wearing, baring the long, toned sweep of her back, broken only by the lines of a black sports bra. He used a claw to shred the bra off her body, his hands sliding around her torso to close over her breasts.</p><p>Her breath hitched, her nipples tight points against his palms. When she tilted her neck to the side, the invitation was clear. Taking it, he sucked a dark red mark on the lower slope, making her twist against him. So, she was exquisitely sensitive there. Something to remember.</p><p>An acid stab of guilt, a reminder that this was not the lover he should be learning how to please, how to adore. He strangled the voice, determined to hold to his decision to move forward ... but it wouldn\u2019t quieten, the black tendrils of betrayal wrapping around his mind and twining through his blood.</p><p>Slender, warm fingers on his own. \u201cWe aren\u2019t the only people in this room right now, are we, Riaz?\u201d</p><p>Backing off, he shoved his hands through his hair, beyond angry at himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean it to go like this.\u201d He\u2019d come to her in honest need, but now that need was tangled with the caustic taste of infidelity, the chill rain of grief. The fact that he knew he had no rational reason to feel disloyal meant nothing when the primal heart of him was fighting itself, tooth and claw.</p><p>Instead of turning on him in fury, a reaction he would\u2019ve understood from a predatory changeling female of her dominance, Adria toed off her boots and crawled into bed, still dressed in her jeans. Giving him her back, she said, \u201cCome here. Lie with me.\u201d</p><p>Every muscle in his body locked, torn between two fiercely opposed desires. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can.\u201d The admission was ripped out of him.</p><p>\u201cNo expectations, just two wolves taking comfort from one another.\u201d A pause heavy with things unsaid. \u201cI need the touch, too.\u201d</p><p>The hidden pain of her, it smashed through the tumult inside him to touch the protective core. Kicking off his own shoes, he stripped off his T-shirt and stretched out behind her. He\u2019d left enough space between their bodies that he could see the graceful curve of her spine, the creamy gold of her skin flawless. It was instinct to run his hand over her back, to accept the skin privileges she\u2019d offered him, even as he petted the pain out of her for a fragment of time.</p><p>Sighing, she swept her braid off her back and over her shoulder, saying nothing as he continued to touch. Though she was the one who was ostensibly receiving pleasure, he gained as much from the contact. He\u2019d come to her broken and lost, and with her vulnerability, she\u2019d given him the tools he needed to reclaim the reins\u2014to help him, this strong woman had had the courage to rip open her own scars. Driven by protective instinct, he curved his bigger, heavier body around hers, his chest pressed to her back, his hand stroking down her arm, slow and easy.</p><p>Her eyes, he saw, were closed, but he knew she was awake. So when she spoke, he wasn\u2019t startled\u2014but neither was he ready for her question. \u201cWill you tell me about her?\u201d</p><p>His answer was automatic. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say.\u201d</p><p>Her lashes remained soft shadows on her cheeks. \u201cOf course there is, and you can\u2019t speak to anyone else. I won\u2019t make any judgments or offer any advice. I\u2019m just here to listen.\u201d</p><p>His hand clenched on her arm before he forced himself to relax his grip. The only reason he\u2019d said anything to Indigo when he first arrived home was because he hadn\u2019t wanted to see her mess up what he\u2019d sensed was the right relationship for her. He didn\u2019t regret that choice, made as it had been out of friendship, but he still sometimes wished she didn\u2019t know\u2014because it was his greatest weakness.</p><p>And Indigo knew the barest facts. Adria already saw too much of him ... and was a woman strong enough, honest enough, to admit to her own wounds. \u201cHer name,\u201d he said, knowing that honesty deserved his own, \u201cis Lisette.\u201d</p><p>Speaking of her caused a sweet, dark pain inside of him, but there was wild joy, too. At last, he could say her name, share her with someone. \u201cShe\u2019s French but works in Venice.\u201d He\u2019d seen her at an elegant ball held in one of the oldest buildings in the sunken city, its stately lower half submerged, its upper half a masterpiece of ornate architecture. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe Human Alliance is based in Venice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisette\u2019s husband, Emil, is a computronic specialist with the Alliance.\u201d He was a successful, smart man who loved his wife.

While SnowDancer\u2019s relationship with the Alliance had thawed enough that the pack was willing to do some business with the group that represented a vast network of human enterprises, neither party was anywhere close to ready to share secrets.</p><p>\u201cIf she runs their comm team, she must be intelligent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt,\u201d he said, mind filling with echoes of the conversations they\u2019d had while he fought his most primal instincts to steal what time he could with her. \u201cBut the first thing I noticed about her was her laugh.\u201d Gentle and warm and so alive. \u201cMy wolf wanted to roll around in it.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never forget walking into the ball in Venice, the sight of her a punch to the solar plexus, the thick mass of her shoulder-length hair shining in the light, such a pure gold it hurt. \u201cShe\u2019s tiny, five feet one maybe, but you don\u2019t notice that when you first meet her.\u201d All he\u2019d noticed was the feminine strength of her.</p><p>\u201cI met with her a number of times\u2014the company she heads produces certain comm technology that could be useful to SnowDancer.\u201d Alone in an office with her, he\u2019d wanted to lunge across the desk separating them, nuzzle his face into her neck, bite her, mark her. \u201cShe felt something, too. I could sense it. It rattled her.\u201d Because Lisette was a faithful, loving wife. \u201cI knew she\u2019d hate herself if she ever betrayed Emil.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe sounds like someone I\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>Thinking of the strong, compassionate woman Adria called sister, he said, \u201cYes, I think you would.\u201d Lisette and Tarah had the same gentle steel to them, the same inviting openness of spirit.</p><p>Realizing he was completely curled around her, the arm he\u2019d placed under her head bent to wrap over her upper chest, he played her braid through his fingers. \u201cDo you have to go anywhere this morning?\u201d It was seven thirty, the den\u2019s corridors certain to be filled with packmates starting their day.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her lashes closed, throwing charcoal shadows onto her cheekbones.</p><p>Exhaling quietly, he closed his own eyes and slept with her, skin to skin, his wolf finding unexpected peace in the nearness of a packmate who didn\u2019t judge, didn\u2019t ask things from him he couldn\u2019t give, and who shared her body with a rare kindness of spirit. Adria Morgan was a woman he would never forget, no matter if their liaison lasted a week or a year.</p><p>HAWKE glanced at Sienna. She\u2019d been pensive since they\u2019d left the home of Mercy\u2019s parents ten minutes earlier\u2014where Mercy and Riley had broken the news of Mercy\u2019s pregnancy to their respective alphas, though both Hawke and Lucas had known the instant they got within ten feet of the redhead. It was funny how that worked\u2014the previous night, they\u2019d had no clue, but now that Riley knew, it was as if Mercy\u2019s leopard had decided it was okay to allow others in on the secret.</p> <p>Hawke and Lucas\u2019s unhidden glee at this most primal seal on the DarkRiver-SnowDancer alliance had garnered them a snarl, though everyone was too goofy with happiness to work up any kind of a good mad. However, right that second, his mind wasn\u2019t on the news that had delighted his wolf enough to put it in harmony with the leopard alpha.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, switching the car into hover mode to ensure he didn\u2019t crush any of the tiny forest plants in this area. \u201cAre you pining for your country music?\u201d She\u2019d forgotten her portable music player, which she usually connected to the onboard stereo. \u201cCruel and unusual punishment, that stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou liked the one we slow danced to last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tolerated it.\u201d The truth was, when they danced, he didn\u2019t hear anything but the whisper of her breath, the beat of her heart, the low murmur of her voice. \u201cTalk to me, baby.\u201d It sounded like an order, and yeah, it kind of was.</p><p>A narrow-eyed glance aimed his way. \u201cI should refuse on principle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I say please?\u201d</p><p>Sienna\u2019s laugh was soft, intimate, that of a woman who knew him, accepted him. She never let it slide when she thought he was pulling shit, but she didn\u2019t bust his ass for acting who he was\u2014an alpha wolf. \u201cI was thinking,\u201d she said, her laughter fading, \u201cabout children. We\u2019ve never talked about it.\u201d</p><p>It was the last thing he\u2019d expected her to say. \u201cYou want babies?\u201d</p> <p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Sienna sink her teeth into her lower lip. \u201cI didn\u2019t really consider it before. Because...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d His hands tightened on the manual steering wheel at the reminder that she\u2019d lived her life believing she\u2019d die before she ever had a chance to live.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still scared.\u201d A quiet confession.</p><p>Wolf sensing her need, he found a clearing and pulled into it, setting the car down so he could turn, brace his arm along the back of her seat. It wasn\u2019t enough, not for either part of him. Shoving back his seat, he slid her across and into his lap. She came without the least protest, a silent indication of just how troubled she was feeling.</p><p>\u201cWe have years,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no rush.\u201d</p><p>She sat up so she could look into his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a genetic mutation, the X-marker, appearing randomly in the population,\u201d she said, a quiet urgency in her every word, \u201cbut there is a very high probability I\u2019ll pass it on to any child I conceive, and I won\u2019t do that, Hawke. I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Cradling her face in his hands, he rubbed his nose affectionately against her own. \u201cChangelings don\u2019t like the way Psy constantly mess with the DNA of their offspring, but even we make an exception for diseases that could harm a child\u2019s welfare.\u201d He continued before she could interrupt, his voice fierce. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, your X-fire isn\u2019t a disease. It\u2019s a gift.\u201d It had saved the pack, saved so many lives. \u201cB\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalker\u2019s helix,\u201d Sienna broke in, her skin flushed with the intensity of her emotions. \u201cI know it keeps me stable, but there\u2019s no predicting the result when the X-marker first goes active.\u201d Tears glittered in the midnight of her eyes. \u201cOur baby could burn up, and we wouldn\u2019t be able to stop it.\u201d</p><p>He cupped the back of her neck, squeezed gently. \u201cWhich is why I was going to say that in spite of the fact I see your ability as a gift, if you want to see a genetic specialist before we try for a child, I\u2019ll be right there beside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Slender fingers on his jaw.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he said, tucking her hair behind her ear, his Psy with her capacity to love with a passion as wild as the crimson and gold of her X-fire. \u201cBut I\u2019m not budging on the hair.\u201d He rubbed the ruby red strands between his fingertips.</p><p>No smile, fear lingering in the ebony shimmer of her eyes. \u201cThe other thing is,\u201d she whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t know how pregnancy will impact my abilities. I know of no case where an X has even been pregnant, much less carried a child to term.\u201d Her throat moved as she swallowed painfully. \u201cThe changes caused by pregnancy could destabilize me, kill our child, hurt the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, baby.\u201d Stroking his hand around to cup her cheek, he ran his thumb over the delicate arch of her cheekbone, warmth cascading through his veins when she turned her face into the touch. \u201cI won\u2019t say that\u2019s not a real worry, but what I will say is that you\u2019re becoming stronger with each day that passes. Fuck, I\u2019m proud of who you are, who you\u2019re becoming.\u201d His wolf strutted around the den with its chest puffed out. \u201cI know when the time comes to make that choice, we\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the other mated couples don\u2019t use anything to prevent conception because the birth rate for changelings is so low, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He kissed the words off her lips, laving affection on her until the tension left her body. \u201cAnything that eases your mind, I\u2019m good with.\u201d Changeling pairs rarely had more than one or two children, and it was highly unlikely Sienna would fall pregnant so soon after mating\u2014but there was no reason to chance it with his mate\u2019s life at stake. \u201cI\u2019m sure Lara will know the best option for Psy physiology.\u201d The healer had been gathering medical knowledge about Psy since the family\u2019s defection to SnowDancer.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Sienna said, a pert look to her that made him chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWas I taking over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little bit.\u201d Fingers weaving through his hair.</p><p>His wolf rubbed up against his skin, wanting that touch. Later, he promised.</p><p>\u201cI spoke to Lara and got what I needed when I first became an adult,\u201d Sienna told him, \u201cI was so afraid about passing on the X mutation.\u201d The mate bond vibrated with quiet passion. \u201cI didn\u2019t purposefully keep it a secret\u2014it just never came up before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Sienna\u2019s honesty was an integral aspect of her nature. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you took care of that or we\u2019d probably be wrangling a litter in a year or two, rabble-rouser that you are.\u201d</p><p>A playful thump against his chest. \u201cI think that maybe, I might not be a bad mother,\u201d she said with a shaky smile, \u201cbut I\u2019m not ready yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m not sure I am either.\u201d He might be wolf, might be alpha, but he was also a man who\u2019d just found his mate after believing he\u2019d never have that bond. \u201cI want this time with you.\u201d Curving his hand around her rib cage, he slanted his mouth over hers in a slow, petting kind of a kiss, licking out at her lower lip, nipping at her upper one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHawke.\u201d His name a caress, Sienna wrapped her arms around his neck and melted into the kiss. A far more pleasurable kind of tension rippled through her body, her eyes devoid of stars for a reason that had nothing to do with fear or worry when she broke the kiss to run her lips along his jaw.</p><p>He groaned, went to slide his hand under her shirt ... but Sienna shifted without warning. Tumbling out of the car after shoving the door open, she shot him a look of pure challenge. \u201cTwenty-minute head start. I get to our grotto before you. Winner does what she wants with the loser.\u201d</p><p>His wolf jerked to attention. \u201cGo.\u201d There was nothing he liked better than playing with Sienna, especially when he had more than one new trick up his sleeve. Baring his lips in a feral grin, he waited exactly twenty minutes before taking off after her.</p> <p>Chapter 32</p><p>ADRIA WAKENED TO find herself wrapped in hot, muscled male flesh. Not for an instant did she wonder who it was that held her, the dark woodsmoke and fresh bite of Riaz\u2019s scent intimately familiar. Sensing he hadn\u2019t yet awakened, she remained motionless, the crispness of his chest hair against her palm an exquisite temptation, the thickness of his thigh shoved between her own\u2014pressed against the part of her that was going damp with a slow, inexorable arousal though she tried to fight the response.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t invited him into bed to demand sex, but there was no way he\u2019d fail to sense her body\u2019s response. His erection rubbed against her almost the instant the thought passed through her head, and then he was rolling her over onto her back, still sleepy-eyed, his hair tousled and unbearably sexy.</p><p>\u201cRiaz,\u201d she said, thrusting a hand into the jet black strands to keep him in place when he would\u2019ve gone for her breasts.</p><p>Except there really was no way to stop a dominant changeling male who outweighed her by a good eighty pounds from going after what he wanted in bed, not unless she wanted to say an unequivocal \u201cno.\u201d Because that would get through. The thing was, she didn\u2019t want to say no. She just wanted to make sure he was fully conscious.</p> <p>\u201cOh God!\u201d Her back arched up off the bed as he took one of her nipples into his mouth and sucked. Hard.</p><p>He fondled her neglected breast with his free hand, a little rough, and so perfect it made her ache. Wanting to rub up against the thickness she could feel hot and rigid against her thigh through the jeans neither of them had taken off, she forced herself to concentrate\u2014and pulled at his hair hard enough that it had to hurt.</p><p>Growling against her skin, he let her feel his teeth. \u201cDamn it,\u201d she demanded, \u201care you awake?\u201d</p><p>He bit down on her nipple ... very, very carefully. She was still attempting to gasp in a breath when he lifted his head and sleepy gold eyes blazed at her. The wolf was in charge, she thought, and its wildness called to her own. Twisting beneath him, she hissed out a breath when he clamped his hand on her hip, his claws pricking at her skin just enough to tell her he was running the show.</p><p>Awake. Very much so.</p><p>\u201cGet your claws off my skin.\u201d It was the snarl of a female wolf who knew her own strength.</p> <p>\u201cI think you like my claws.\u201d A feral smile, but he did retract the sharp tips.</p><p>His response unbalanced her wolf\u2014men of his dominance weren\u2019t so easily commanded.</p><p>\u201cI also think,\u201d he said in a dark whisper that made the tiny hairs on her body quiver in warning, \u201cyou\u2019ll like this even more.\u201d Sliding his hand over her navel\u2014the skin so exquisitely sensitive her toes curled\u2014he thrust it under the waistband of her jeans and into her panties in a single unpredictable move.</p><p>It shattered her to look down and see his muscled forearm, a sprinkling of fine black hair on the dusky brown of his skin, disappearing into her jeans ... where he cupped her with stark intimacy within the tight confines of her clothing. Chest jerking, she rose up against him in a vain effort to find relief.</p><p>\u201cUndo your jeans.\u201d His voice edgy in her ear, the scrape of his unshaven jaw an erotic temptation.</p><p>Her fingers brushed his arm as she obeyed the order that promised to give her what she wanted. Removing his hand to rip off her jeans the second she unzipped the fly, he kicked her legs apart to settle himself in between, his jean-covered cock pushing up against the white lace and blue satin of her panties in blatant demand. \u201cTell me,\u201d he said, the hairs on his chest rubbing over her already sensitized nipples, threatening to steal what sense of reason remained, \u201csomething you\u2019ve always wanted to do in bed but never dared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked, her skin stretched taut over a body it couldn\u2019t contain.</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to play.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until the words were out that Riaz realized what he\u2019d said. Playing with a bedmate ... for a lone wolf, it was beyond friendship, beyond need, a step into an altogether different kind of a relationship.</p> <p>No, he contradicted himself the second after the thought passed through his head. Neither one of them wanted a relationship, least of all Adria. They were in this to give each other a little surcease. And there was nothing wrong with playing with a friend, even if his wolf rarely played with anyone. \u201cNo?\u201d he said when she remained silent.</p><p>Her eyes a pale, haunting amber\u2014the wolf looking out at him\u2014she said, \u201cIf you promise to reciprocate.\u201d</p><p>Wolfish curiosity rose to the fore. He nodded at once.</p><p>She went to speak, halted, hot red painting her cheeks. Her sudden, unexpected shyness only deepened his curiosity\u2014until he glimpsed the darkness that shadowed her eyes without warning. And he knew she was no longer fully with him, the past tangling with the present.</p><p>Gripping her jaw, he growled, \u201cMe and you. No one else comes into this bed. Got it?\u201d It was a vow as much as it was a demand.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Amber clashing into his. \u201cFor both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He closed their deal with a hot, openmouthed kiss, grazing the bottom of her left breast with his thumb as he did so.</p><p>Adria jerked away from the kiss with a gasp. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some women can orgasm just by having their breasts caressed,\u201d she said, her husky voice breathless. \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered if I could.\u201d Her cheeks were blazing by the time she finished.</p><p>\u201cSomehow, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d be shy.\u201d It did something to him to know she trusted him enough to drop her guard. \u201cAnything else you want to share about this fantasy?\u201d</p><p>Adria shook her head, feeling naked in a way that had nothing to do with exposing skin. Allowing more of his weight onto her body, Riaz took her mouth in another kiss. A raunchy, wet, demanding one that had her digging her nails into his shoulder as she ground her body against the rigid intrusion of his cock.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said, lifting his body off the aching need of her own, \u201cthis experiment won\u2019t work if you can do that.\u201d He moved to lie beside her, but when she turned to face him, he said, \u201cOn your back.\u201d</p><p>Everything in her wanted to push him to his back, ride him to erotic bliss.</p><p>\u201cGiving up so soon?\u201d</p><p>Eyes narrowed at the low-voiced challenge, she turned onto her back. When he picked up her arms and told her to wrap her hands around the bars in the headboard, she gripped the cold iron. The position left her breasts blatantly exposed, but for her braid, which had fallen over her shoulder.</p><p>Taking that braid, Riaz undid it with leisurely motions, fanning her hair out over one side of her chest. The long strands covered her breast, but for the taut peak of her nipple. \u201cLook at that,\u201d he murmured in that deep voice rough with an earthy sensuality that spoke to her own, \u201cso pretty and pink.\u201d</p><p>Her throat went dry. There was something about seeing her body through his eyes that changed everything. Each breath she took lifted her breasts, as if in invitation, her nipples begging for his mouth, shameless and plump.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Riaz captured one sensitive nub between thumb and forefinger, the lightness of his touch an exquisite tease.</p><p>The instant she arched her spine in an attempt to intensify the caress, he shook his head, his fingers turning featherlight. Understanding the unspoken order, she forced herself to lie back.</p><p>The slightly rough pads of his fingers squeezed her nipple tight. \u201cGood girl.\u201d</p><p>She growled low in her throat. \u201cDon\u2019t push it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, eyes gleaming. Then he dipped his head and flicked his tongue over the nipple he\u2019d been teasing. It shot an electric current through her body, but the sensation disappeared almost before she\u2019d sensed it, the air cold on the wet slickness of the tightly furled nub. Chest rising and falling in jerking breaths, she clenched her fingers around the metal that had warmed under her touch, and opened eyes she hadn\u2019t been aware of closing to see Riaz pushing her hair aside to reveal her bare breast.</p><p>A kiss of air followed, his lips torturously close, his hand sliding to her rib cage. \u201cDo you like this?\u201d He rubbed his thumb across the bottom of the taut curve.</p><p>She shuddered, her claws pricking the insides of her skin. \u201cMore.\u201d</p><p>The forearm of his free hand braced by her head, Riaz initiated a languid seduction of a kiss, his tongue licking lazily against her own, his thumb continuing to move slow and maddening across the agonizingly sensitive lower curve of her breast. \u201cMmm.\u201d The low male murmur made her womb clench as he broke the kiss with a suckling taste of her upper lip.</p><p>Her skin shimmering with sensation, she held the wild gold of his gaze, hissing out a breath when he moved his fingers to her nipple again, rubbing and tugging with much more force.</p><p>It tore a groan out of her, her eyes fluttering shut.</p><p>A single hot breath was the only warning she had before he took part of her neglected breast into his mouth, scraping up with his teeth until he caught her nipple. A flick of his tongue and she arched up off the bed, thrusting her hands into his hair. \u201cForget about the experiment,\u201d she snarled, and twisted, taking him to his back.</p><p>He\u2019d let her do it, she knew that. Because while she was a strong dominant, he was a lieutenant, far stronger and with faster reflexes. It didn\u2019t matter, not in bed, not with lovers who cared about one another\u2019s pleasure. And they did. Her wolf felt happy, playful for the first time in years. It was a giddy sensation, champagne in her bloodstream. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reaching forward, she pinned his wrists above his head, his bones solid and powerful under her hold. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to behave.\u201d</p><p>A heavy-lidded look, slits of bright gold. \u201cWhat\u2019s my incentive?\u201d</p><p>She shifted down his body until the satin of her panties, her most delicate flesh slick with desire beyond the fine barrier, rubbed over the heated steel of his cock. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>HE\u2019D seen her angry, seen her heartbroken, seen her pleasured, but this was the first time Riaz had seen Adria with sensual mischief in her eyes. His wolf responded, lunging with playful intent. Jerking up even as she began to shape and pet his chest, he flipped her onto her back again, ending up braced on his hands and knees above her. \u201cPretty good, but I\u2019ve never been one to give up on a challenge.\u201d Bending his head to her breasts, he used his teeth, nipping and biting.</p><p>She dug her claws into his shoulder. \u201cStings.\u201d</p><p>Raising his head, he said, \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I like the taste of you.\u201d He returned to what he\u2019d been doing, sucking on her nipples until they were ripe little berries before licking the lower curve of her breasts and taking another bite. Her legs rose up to hook around his hips, a sweet, tight prison. Not fighting, he settled heavily against her, enjoying the tensile strength of her married with the lush tang of her femininity, her breasts filling his hands.</p> <p>Her fingers wove into his hair again, fisted.</p><p>Releasing her breast, he rubbed his unshaven jaw against the soft curve. She uttered a stark sound of pleasure and attempted to slide her delicate heat against the painful rigidity of his cock, but wise to her tricks, he pinned her to the bed with his greater weight. She made her frustration clear in the claws he felt biting into his skin.</p><p>Slicing out his own claws, he squeezed her hip in warning.</p><p>A snarl.</p><p>Kissing his way up the center of her chest, he sucked a mark on her throat. It made her moan, the snarl transforming into a husky sound of pleasure. He squeezed one breast, dipped back down to rub his jaw over the other, the creamy flesh marked by his attentions.</p><p>A jolt shook her frame. \u201cRiaz.\u201d</p> <p>Hearing the fracture in her voice, he bit down just a little too hard on one nipple as he rolled the other between his fingertips. She shattered with a sudden, shocked cry, her thighs clenching around his hips, one hand fisted in his hair, the nails of the other digging into his shoulder. A hint of blood scented the air and his wolf bared its teeth, not in anger but in primitive satisfaction.</p><p>Breaking her hold, he pulled down her panties, got rid of his own remaining clothing and slid into her in a single, deep thrust. She welcomed him with a wild tangle of a kiss, her body continuing to ripple with aftershocks of pleasure that squeezed his pulsing cock, the pressure dragging him to the edge.</p><p>He broke the kiss, gasped in a jagged breath. Two long, hard thrusts and he felt his spine lock. Gritting his teeth, he tilted her so that his pubic bone would press against her clitoris, and then he thrust again.</p><p>Tiny muscles spasming anew around his cock, a molten fist.</p><p>His mind went black.</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>THOUGH VASIC TELEPORTED directly into Anthony Kyriakus\u2019s office, the Councilor\u2019s patrician face didn\u2019t display any hint of surprise. Leaning back in his chair, the silver threads in his hair glimmering in the sunlight pouring through the window behind him, he met Vasic\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His goals had once aligned with Anthony\u2019s, but Vasic\u2019s loyalty would always be to the Arrows. \u201cThe Council is fractured.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not yet common knowledge,\u201d Anthony said, putting down the laser pen he\u2019d been using to make notes on a datapad.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014but rumors are beginning to spread.\u201d He studied the comm screen on the wall to his right, currently displaying the logos of a number of companies, some well known, others discreet powerhouses. \u201cSatisfied clients?\u201d Anthony controlled the largest network of foreseers in the world. Corporations paid millions to get predictions from a NightStar F-Psy before making decisions on everything from investments to product development.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d Anthony didn\u2019t rise. \u201cDo the Arrows require a prediction?\u201d</p><p>Vasic had always wondered if Anthony had a touch of the F ability, though he was listed in the official records as a high-Gradient telepath with a minor illusion ability. An ability he\u2019d apparently passed on to his daughter, Faith. \u201cPure Psy has moved on from licking its wounds\u2014indications are it has an operation in progress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Rising from his chair, Anthony turned to walk to the window.</p><p>Vasic joined him, his eyes on the landscaped park below, the grass jewel green, the trees lush with foliage. \u201cAn unusual view.\u201d Psy corporations preferred to be in city centers, in high-rises created from glass and steel. The internal NightStar compound, by contrast, was all low, earth-toned buildings designed to flow into the environment.</p><p>\u201cEvents have led NightStar to question the need for isolation in order to guard the mental health of even our most powerful F-Psy, but foreseers do have unique requirements in comparison to the other designations.\u201d Anthony nodded at a sturdy-looking man who\u2019d walked out of the opposite building to take a seat beneath the spreading branches of a large oak. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously had a strong prediction, and it\u2019s drained him. I find my Fs function better\u2014thus increasing our profits\u2014if they have not merely soothing surroundings, but the freedom and space to recover.\u201d</p><p>Vasic could understand that need better than Anthony would ever know. He often teleported to deserts cloaked in moonlight, because it was only there, surrounded by an endless nothingness that was strangely alive, that he could truly think. \u201cSome would say such a need is an emotional response and should be conditioned out of your foreseers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Anthony said without looking away from the recovering F-Psy. \u201cNobody would dare\u2014my people are too necessary to the continuing success of the businesses run by the most powerful. Something I make certain no one ever forgets.\u201d</p><p>And that was why Vasic had first agreed to work with Anthony\u2014the man was ruthless, but he had the same kind of loyalty to his foreseers that Vasic had to the Arrows. \u201cDo your F-Psy know anything about the Pure Psy situation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA number have foreseen what they call a cataclysmic change in the Net,\u201d Anthony replied. \u201cThe visions are so violent the medics have had to intervene in three cases to bring the foreseers safely out. If they hadn\u2019t been under supervision\u201d\u2014the slightest pause\u2014\u201cwe\u2019d have lost them.\u201d</p><p>Vasic wondered if the pause had been an unconscious reference to Anthony\u2019s daughter. Faith NightStar was the most powerful F-Psy in or out of the Net, the reason the squad had kept a covert eye on her since her defection to DarkRiver. Her Silence broken, there was a strong likelihood she\u2019d been one of the foreseers Anthony had referenced. While Faith was no longer under M-Psy supervision, she was connected to her jaguar-changeling mate by a type of psychic bond Vasic didn\u2019t understand. Perhaps that bond protected her in some way. \u201cNo details?\u201d</p><p>Anthony shook his head. \u201cBut it\u2019s worse than anything they saw prior to the battle with the changelings. The scale of the deaths will be catastrophic.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>FEELING MORE HIMSELF than he had in months, Riaz was out looking for a wind-fallen tree he could mine for a hunk of wood when something caught the sunlight\u2014and his eye. He bent down, picked up a twisted piece of metal. Seeing the scorched and broken tree trunks around him, he realized he was at the spot where one of Henry Scott\u2019s stealth craft had crashed prior to the final confrontation. It wasn\u2019t surprising the small piece had been missed, the debris had been spread over such a large area.</p><p>Placing it into one of the pockets in his cargo pants, he decided to do a quick grid search to see if there were any other fragments. It didn\u2019t take long under the bright Sierra sunshine. The techs and novices had done an excellent job\u2014but for the damage to the environment, the area was pristine. That damage, too, would heal. SnowDancer would make sure of it.</p><p>Satisfied, he took a quick glance at his watch, saw it was four. Since he\u2019d already found a small chunk of the type of wood he needed, he was about to head back to the den to complete his review of SnowDancer\u2019s international business plan, when he caught a vague hint of a scent that shouldn\u2019t have been there.</p><p>Metallic. Cold. A Psy drenched in Silence.</p><p>It could be nothing, a remnant attached to another piece of debris, though the probability was low taking into account the time that had passed. And all the penny-ante annoyance hits to date had taken place on the edges of den territory. Why would any Psy want to seriously antagonize SnowDancer now, after the pack\u2019s decisive defeat of Henry\u2019s army?</p><p>Tracking the scent on silent feet, he came to the top of a small rise. Here, the lingering scent was as thick as soup to his changeling senses. He frowned. The position offered the watcher no strategic viewpoint in terms of figuring out SnowDancer\u2019s weaknesses. All he or she would see was a small, naturally open field surrounded by scrubby bush that merged into a stand of lodgepole pines.</p><p>A curvy young female with lush black curls\u2014Maria\u2014jogged across the clearing at that very second, accompanied by a dark gray wolf who spotted Riaz a second before Maria did. The soldier waved, while the wolf howled a greeting before they both disappeared into the pines.</p><p>Hmm...</p><p>Psy had been known to use SnowDancer land for meetings, which wasn\u2019t as stupid a move as it sounded, not given the spread of den territory, and how simple it was to teleport into isolated sections. This spot might qualify, except as Maria and Lake had just proven, anyone on this hill would be silhouetted against the sky, openly visible to a passing sentry.</p><p>Gut-certain he was missing something, he kicked off his boots and stripped. His sense of smell was acute even as a human, but nothing beat the wolf\u2019s nose. Circling the area after shifting, he checked twice to make sure he had it right, then changed back into human form and quickly got dressed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Racing to the den, he pushed into Hawke\u2019s office without waiting for an invitation. \u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>The alpha turned from the comm screen where he was talking to a man who wore a neat three-piece suit, his graying hair combed sternly back to reveal a defined widow\u2019s peak. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to continue this another time, Mr. Woo.\u201d</p><p>Pursing his lips in disapproval, the man on the other side nonetheless made no demur as Hawke signed off. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d His eyes flicked over Riaz\u2019s shoulder, sharpened.</p> <p>Riaz had already turned to greet Riley, pushing the door closed behind the senior lieutenant. \u201cDo you have what I asked for?\u201d He\u2019d called Riley during his run to the den.</p><p>Nodding, the other man input a data crystal into the comm panel. \u201cThese are the watch routes I\u2019ve assigned the soldiers and novices over the past two weeks.\u201d A longer period than warranted by the intensity of the scent, but Riaz hadn\u2019t wanted to risk missing a pattern because of too tight a date range.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve color-coded the individual soldiers,\u201d Riley continued, \u201cso you can see who was where when at a glance.\u201d</p><p>Riaz pinpointed the rise where he\u2019d caught the scent, inserted an asterisk to mark the spot on the map, then checked which packmates had passed within sight of it. Fury ignited in his blood. \u201cThe shape of the scent on the earth,\u201d he said, after filling Hawke and Riley in on his discovery, \u201csays the intruder was lying down.\u201d It was the only way he or she could have escaped detection.</p><p>\u201cSniper?\u201d Riley asked in a grim tone.</p> <p>\u201cOr surveillance.\u201d Ice in Hawke\u2019s voice, the wolf stalking behind pale eyes fixed on the assignment map. \u201cNo reason for the Psy to watch Maria, Tai, Riordan, or Ebony.\u201d</p><p>That left one name.</p><p>\u201cWe knew this would happen,\u201d Riaz said, tracking the deep aqua color Riley had allocated Sienna, his anger transforming into a cold determination to keep safe the young woman who\u2019d walked into battle willing to die for SnowDancer. \u201cEveryone in the Net now knows what she can do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped they\u2019d leave her alone a few fucking months at least.\u201d The words were gritted out between the alpha\u2019s clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d they know she\u2019d pass through that field?\u201d Riaz thrust a hand through his hair. \u201cRiley mixes up assignments.\u201d SnowDancer had had one traitor in their midst\u2014another one would kill them; but the question had to be asked. \u201cYou think they have an informant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hawke\u2019s response held utmost confidence. \u201cI\u2019m betting they\u2019ve been using spy satellites to scan our territory\u2014the canopy makes it difficult in most cases, but there are open areas.\u201d</p> <p>Riaz gave a slow nod. \u201cAll they\u2019d have needed was a single glimpse of Sienna\u201d\u2014her hair that distinctive ruby red\u2014\u201cand then they just had to be patient.\u201d He considered the other implications if Hawke was right. \u201cNo normal person would have access to that kind of satellite data. Or to a teleporter.\u201d Flying or driving any unauthorized vehicle into the territory without being caught was so difficult as to be impossible.</p><p>\u201cPure Psy,\u201d Riley said, his eyes on the map, \u201clost the majority of their Tks in the fight. If Judd\u2019s right about the rumblings in the Net, the group\u2019s probably got other priorities at this point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMing is the most obvious suspect.\u201d Riaz was aware the man had been the military mastermind of the Council. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have enough information to rule anyone out. Kaleb Krychek for one.\u201d The lethal telekinetic could see Sienna as a threat to his own power.</p><p>\u201cShoshanna\u2019s gone suspiciously quiet, but she was the force behind Henry for most of their sham of a marriage,\u201d Hawke said, and Riaz knew the alpha\u2019s brain was working with cold efficiency in spite of his rage. \u201cAnd Tatiana\u2019s always been very good at hiding her involvement in any number of ops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Judd.\u201d Shutting down the map, Riley retrieved the data crystal. \u201cHe might be able to get us more concrete data.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tap my contacts in Europe,\u201d Riaz added, knowing Ming used an estate in the Champagne region of France as his home base. \u201cSee what I can dig up.\u201d Glimpsing the look in his alpha\u2019s eyes, he said, \u201cNo one will get near her, Hawke. We won\u2019t let them.\u201d</p><p>Hawke knew his people would bleed to protect his mate, but he didn\u2019t want Sienna to need that protection, to be forced to live in another cage. \u201cWe make sure she\u2019s safe on our land,\u201d he said, his anger an icy blade. \u201cThis needs to be her home, where she can walk without fear.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s phone beeped a sharp alarm into the silence. \u201cDamn,\u201d the lieutenant said, glancing at the screen after switching it off. \u201cI have the comm-conference with Kenji and the BlackSea rep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGo,\u201d Hawke said, thinking past the fury that clawed through his veins. \u201cThat\u2019s your priority.\u201d BlackSea brought far too much to the table to disregard. \u201cI need to talk to Sienna anyway.\u201d Any defensive response SnowDancer formulated would need her input\u2014she knew the strengths and weaknesses of her enemies better than anyone.</p><p>Riley shot him an openly concerned look after Riaz left. \u201cIt might go better coming from me.\u201d</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t take it wrong\u2014Riley wasn\u2019t only his senior lieutenant, he was also Hawke\u2019s friend, knew exactly how this might make him behave. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>HAVING tracked Sienna to the nursery where she was doing a volunteer shift, Hawke watched his mate talking with a two-year-old. Thank God she was inside today\u2014he didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d have been able to handle his primal response if she\u2019d been out in the thick green of the forests.</p><p>He knew she\u2019d sensed his presence, but she didn\u2019t break off what appeared to be a serious discussion. Nodding solemnly at something the little boy said, she helped him finish building his wooden-block masterpiece before rising to her feet and walking over to Tarah.</p><p>A short conversation later, she headed toward him. \u201cI asked to leave early,\u201d she said, and he knew he\u2019d failed in his attempt to shield the raw emotions that had his wolf pacing, claws out.</p><p>\u201cWalk with me.\u201d</p><p>Not asking questions, she accompanied him down the corridors and to an exit from the den that led into a less utilized section of the White Zone. Where he leaned against the moss-covered wall of the den and gathered her into his arms, just held her for a long, long time.</p><p>Sienna was intensity and fire and energy, but today, she stood quiet, letting him take what he needed, his mate who knew him better than he knew himself.</p><p>When he drew back at last and told her what Riaz had discovered, the cardinal starlight of her gaze turned to endless midnight. \u201cIt was predictable,\u201d she said, no shock in her, just an anger as deep as his own. \u201cNo one likes a rogue X.\u201d</p><p>A growl rumbled up from his chest. \u201cI will not allow anyone to hunt you.\u201d It was a vow from the heart of the wolf. \u201cBrenna and Mariska are already working on further fine-tuning our surveillance systems, so we have a better chance of detecting these incursions.\u201d The fact that it was near impossible to stop teleport-capable Tks from going anywhere they wanted meant nothing\u2014no one in SnowDancer was planning to make it easy for those stalking Sienna.</p><p>His mate placed her right hand against his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll speak with them,\u201d she said, \u201clet them know a few elements they can factor into their calculations. Judd will probably be able to provide more guidance.\u201d</p><p>At times, he forgot how Sienna had been brought up, the inhumanity of her childhood. Then she showed this depth of strength, keeping a steely calm through an ugliness that would\u2019ve shoved many back into the darkness, and he remembered that his young mate had lived a lifetime in nineteen years. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, his pride in her a blinding fire. \u201cYou also need to talk to Riley about your watch rotations.\u201d</p><p>A guarded alertness. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he can make sure your shifts never fall into any kind of a pattern, timing or location wise. We don\u2019t want those watching being able to guess with any hope of accuracy where you\u2019ll be.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders lost the fine tension that had flowed into her with his earlier words. \u201cYes, that\u2019s an excellent precaution.\u201d</p><p>Cradling her face with one hand, he said, \u201cI won\u2019t ever clip your wings, baby.\u201d Regardless of how much he hated the fact that she was in danger\u2014because to do so would be to put her back in that cage, and his mate had spent more than enough time locked in the dark.</p><p>\u201cI know you want to protect me,\u201d she whispered, long, slender fingers spreading over his heart. \u201cI can feel your need in every pulse of your blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise that I won\u2019t check up on you every so often during your shifts,\u201d Hawke admitted, because it would\u2019ve been a lie of monumental proportions to do otherwise, \u201cbut every part of me understands who you are.\u201d Not simply his mate, but a dangerous, beautiful woman with her own dreams and desires.</p><p>It would\u2019ve been easier if she\u2019d been someone else, a woman who followed his every dictate and who never put herself in harm\u2019s way. But he didn\u2019t want easier, didn\u2019t want anyone else. He wanted Sienna. Only Sienna.</p><p>She turned her face into his hand. \u201cAll right.\u201d A simple acceptance that said she knew, understood ... followed by an unexpected smile full of mischief. \u201cScuttlebutt is, Riley\u2019s been running into Mercy \u2018accidentally\u2019 during her shifts since they found out about the pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf was startled out of its anger into a chuckle. \u201cI hope Mercy lives up to her name.\u201d</p><p>Sienna laughed, no fear in her, only a strength that made his wolf want to throw back its head and sing in joy that she was his.</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>RIAZ LINKED IN with Kenji in the conference room usually used for SnowDancer lieutenant meetings. The other man\u2019s hair was now a shocking pink with vivid blue streaks. It was a welcome distraction. \u201cYou look like fucking Japanese cotton candy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow the hell can cotton candy look Japanese?\u201d Kenji shot back before picking up a datapad. \u201cAny new thoughts on the outline agreement since our last call?\u201d</p><p>Knowing they were short on time, Riaz decided to update Kenji on the situation with Sienna later, and brought up the contract on a split screen that would be visible on Kenji\u2019s end, too. \u201cYeah, one.\u201d He quickly set it out. \u201cYou see any problems?\u201d</p><p>Kenji shook his head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s a good amendment.\u201d He highlighted a section in the agreement they\u2019d discussed earlier. \u201cI\u2019m still not sure about this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey won\u2019t consent to a complete strikeout, and it\u2019s not a deal breaker for us,\u201d Riaz said, \u201cbut let\u2019s bring it up and see what concessions we can squeeze out of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d</p><p>One of the other comm screens in the room chimed a five-second countdown as Kenji finished speaking. Clearing away the contract, Riaz was ready when the third screen filled with Emani Berg\u2019s elegant face. Born in a small village along one of Norway\u2019s remote fjords, Emani had skin of a deep, silken shade of brown, and eyes of midnight. Her black hair had been in curls the last time Riaz had seen her\u2014in Venice\u2014but fell sleek and straight around her face today ... complete with a single streak of shocking pink.</p><p>Amused, Riaz said, \u201cGood call.\u201d</p><p>Emani\u2019s nod was regal. \u201cMr. Tanaka does keep things interesting.\u201d</p> <p>Kenji looked disgruntled. \u201cHow did you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have someone in your region.\u201d Not even a hint of a smile, though Riaz knew her well enough to know she was tweaking Kenji\u2019s nose. The woman was a killer poker player.</p><p>\u201cFleeced any innocents lately?\u201d Riaz asked, recalling the soccer tickets she\u2019d won off him and Pierce, the same serene expression on her face the entire game.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to do so in the next few minutes,\u201d was the smooth response.</p><p>Laughing, he lifted the printout of the outline. \u201cThis,\u201d he said, \u201cis fine as far as the basics go, but we\u2019d like to make some changes with regard to the details.\u201d</p><p>Her surprise was concealed with such flawless ease, Riaz would\u2019ve missed it if he hadn\u2019t been watching for just such a reaction. \u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d she said in that calm, temperate voice.</p> <p>Riaz nodded at Kenji, who began to go through SnowDancer\u2019s list of requested amendments. Emani frowned at some of their stipulations but didn\u2019t voice outright disagreement. Once Kenji had completed the run-through, she looked up from the copy on which she\u2019d been making notes. \u201cI\u2019ll need to run this past our Conclave, but while we\u2019ll certainly be coming back to you with our own changes, I don\u2019t foresee any major problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Riaz folded his arms. \u201cBlackSea realizes we\u2019re already in alliance with DarkRiver and WindHaven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. We understand that should we agree to a full alliance, BlackSea would be expected to come to their aid when necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd vice versa,\u201d Kenji pointed out.</p><p>Emani gave a graceful nod. \u201cAs DarkRiver and WindHaven would effectively become our allies should SnowDancer and BlackSea come to an understanding, our Conclave would like to have a comm conversation with both Lucas Hunter, and Adam Garrett of the WindHaven falcons before we take the final step into an alliance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see a problem with that,\u201d Riaz said. \u201cWe also have a request: a face-to-face meeting between Hawke and Miane.\u201d He didn\u2019t mention the fact the request was nonnegotiable, wanting to gauge how well BlackSea was willing to play with SnowDancer.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d A small pause.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cIs that a no?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOn the contrary. We expected the request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll work with you to set it up then.\u201d There was no use waiting, not when the entire alliance might hang on the reaction the two alphas had to one another.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d Emani\u2019s image swayed a little, then righted.</p><p>\u201cRough seas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing unusual.\u201d Tapping at the comm controls on her desk, she looked at him and Kenji in turn. \u201cWhile we are not yet allied, BlackSea would like to pass on some information in the spirit of cooperation.\u201d</p><p>Not waiting for a verbal response, Emani split her screen. \u201cTwo days ago, three of our members found a ship dead in the water off the coast of Sardinia\u2014well outside their territorial waters, however.\u201d The empty half of the screen filled with the image of a sleek yacht that had to be at least one hundred feet long. Painted a gleaming black, it was shaped like a bullet, the windows tinted. \u201cAs per our own internal rules, they shifted into human form to render assistance.\u201d</p><p>Riaz had no trouble believing her explanation. More than one stranded sailor or shipwrecked crew had been saved by those from BlackSea\u2014the sea changelings might have been notoriously secretive, but they didn\u2019t hesitate when it came to a question of saving lives.</p><p>\u201cAll seven of the people on board were Psy,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey\u2019d been dead long enough to cool, but rigor had not yet begun to set in.\u201d Seven crime scene images appeared onscreen, replacing that of the yacht. \u201cAs you can see, they appear to have been executed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuggests a team with military training,\u201d Kenji murmured before pausing and asking Emani to reorder the images a certain way. \u201cNo, not a team. Look at what I\u2019d bet was the first kill\u2014broken neck. The rest are all clean strikes with a laser weapon. Silent and efficient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe agree. It appears the individual responsible for the executions took the weapon from the first victim and proceeded to use it to eliminate the others.\u201d</p><p>And, Riaz thought, if the yacht had been found in the high seas, that pointed to the involvement of a second craft\u2014no one but another water-based changeling could\u2019ve swum to shore from that far out. In which case, BlackSea would\u2019ve sunk the boat and its dead cargo in short order, no one the wiser.</p><p>\u201cOur people,\u201d Emani said, breaking into his thoughts, \u201chad enough time before a Psy team located the boat that we were able to gather a significant amount of data. One of the things we discovered was this scrap of fabric.\u201d</p><p>Riaz stared at the image of the ragged square, one half of it bearing an emblem of some kind. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, very likely.\u201d Emani input a command and the fragment re-formed into a whole.</p><p>Kenji hissed out a breath. \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d</p><p>ADRIA had just finished having coffee with Tarah and was heading back to the office she\u2019d been assigned down the corridor from Drew when Shawnelle ran up to her. With an exuberant personality and wild bronze curls to match, the athletic fifteen-year-old was incredibly sweet, a gentle maternal submissive.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t forget?\u201d the girl asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Adria reassured her. \u201cI was about to get my camera\u2014you want photos, right?\u201d</p><p>A bright smile against skin the shade of polished teak. \u201cDo you think anyone will want to see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try that shy act on me,\u201d Adria teased, tugging on one of Shawnie\u2019s tight curls. \u201cWalker\u2019s put me onto your tricks.\u201d</p><p>Shawnie giggled, protesting her innocence all the way to Adria\u2019s office, where Adria grabbed a camera capable of taking holographic images as well as high-definition two-dimensional shots. \u201cI\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>Shawnelle led her quickly down the corridors, past all the busy sections, to a small room at the very back. Pushing through the door, she waved Adria in with excited motions.</p><p>Entering, Adria whistled. \u201cYou have a bunch of elves working for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe others helped,\u201d Shawnie said. \u201cEspecially Becca and Ivy.\u201d</p><p>Adria shook her head. The room had been four plain stone walls and a door when she\u2019d assisted Shawnie make the request for a work space. The teen had been terrified of approaching Riley on her own, but she\u2019d had the will. All Adria had had to do was provide moral support.</p><p>Now, the four walls were each painted a different colors from lime green to blood orange to aqua-blue and crisp white, the paint remnants no doubt left over from when the maternals had redone the common areas of the den. Vibrant and alive, it suited Shawnie. The faded carpet on the floor was clearly a discard from someone\u2019s home, but it had been washed and dusted to within an inch of its life, its battered elegance imparting a warm coziness to the room.</p><p>Against one wall stood a long table on which were spread swatches of fabric, beside it a compact sewing machine, while there was a small curtained cubicle to the back. Walking to the cubicle, Shawnie whispered to the person on the other side\u2014Ivy, from the scent\u2014then glanced at Adria. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>Adria held up the camera. \u201cSet.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Shawnie pulled the curtain back with a theatrical flourish to reveal her friend dressed in a beautifully worked black jacket that nipped in at the waist before flaring out gently just above Ivy\u2019s slender hips. It was detailed with funky beading on one shoulder\u2014as if a colorful rain had fallen down the velvet of the jacket\u2014and set atop a simple pair of blue jeans, strappy black heels completing the look.</p><p>Stunned by the beauty of Shawnie\u2019s work, Adria didn\u2019t say anything as Ivy held a number of poses to fully display the jacket. \u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re a star.\u201d She smiled at Ivy. \u201cAnd you\u2019re on the way to being on a catwalk.\u201d</p><p>They both blushed, looking toward each other with huge smiles.</p><p>Adria snapped a photo, capturing the moment. \u201cThat one\u2019s for you two.\u201d Then she took a number of shots of Ivy displaying Shawnie\u2019s creation for SnowDancer\u2019s weekly newsletter.</p><p>\u201cYou really like it?\u201d Shawnie asked afterward, her heart on her sleeve.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d wear it if it was in my size,\u201d Adria said honestly, conscious that nurturing the juvenile\u2019s pride and self-confidence, while listed nowhere in her official mandate as Shawnie\u2019s trainer, would flow into every other aspect of the girl\u2019s life\u2014including the defensive and aggressive moves Adria was teaching her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Shawnie bounced away to help Ivy change out of the jacket, Adria\u2019s wolf laid its head on its paws, its belly warm with contentment\u2014like the human part of her, it knew this work was as important to the health of the pack as any battle victory, any security measure. Shawnie\u2019s bright spirit, Ivy\u2019s innocent pleasure in her friend\u2019s accomplishment, these were the things every dominant fought to protect.</p><p>KENJI met Riaz\u2019s gaze after Emani signed off. \u201cHow do you want to handle this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go talk to Bo,\u201d Riaz said, referring to the security chief and effective leader of the Human Alliance, a man he\u2019d taken care to get to know after the Alliance\u2019s run-in with SnowDancer and DarkRiver.</p> <p>\u201cHawke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d The alpha had enough on his plate with the threat to Sienna\u2014and he\u2019d always trusted his lieutenants to work independently, part of the reason why SnowDancer had such strong men and women in those positions. \u201cLet me see what I can find out first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put out some feelers, too,\u201d Kenji said, his expression serious in a way that belied the reckless abandon of his chosen hair color.</p><p>\u201cCall me on my cell if you hear anything.\u201d Logging off, Riaz decided to grab some coffee from the nearby break room before calling Bowen. He was frowning at the implications of the Human Alliance being involved in the assassination of an entire Psy team when he walked into the break room\u2014to come to a complete halt, the scent of crushed berries in ice wrapping around him, delicate as the most fragile snowflake.</p><p>Chapter 36</p> <p>ADRIA LOOKED FROM the counter, her guarded smile familiar. \u201cHey.\u201d She held up the coffeepot, pouring him a mug when he nodded. \u201cMilk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, black.\u201d It felt strange to be having this ordinary conversation with her, the undertone faintly awkward, when he\u2019d been buried balls-deep in her only hours ago.</p><p>\u201cHere you go.\u201d Passing it over, she began to add sugar to her own mug.</p><p>His eyebrows rose after the fourth teaspoon, the awkwardness dissipating into an amused affection that made his wolf prick its ears. \u201cSure you don\u2019t want some coffee with your sugar?\u201d he asked when she began to stir.</p><p>\u201cEveryone has their vices.\u201d A suspiciously bland comment, followed by, \u201cMaybe you\u2019d like me to fetch you a bar of dark chocolate.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, wondering how she\u2019d figured out his predilection for the stuff. \u201cI figured you were a strong-black-coffee type of girl.\u201d It intrigued him that he\u2019d been so off base, made him aware of all the things he didn\u2019t know about this woman who\u2019d shared her body with him. Especially when she poured in what looked like half a pot of cream, then took a gulp, shivering with pleasure.</p> <p>His body hardened. The urge to touch her, to claim skin privileges outside the bedroom was almost overwhelming, but he grit his teeth and fought it. They\u2019d set limits on their relationship, and he needed to respect that, not only for his sake, but for hers.</p><p>Adria leaned back against the counter. \u201cYou look tense.\u201d</p><p>Her color-drenched eyes, they saw too much. It was one of the first things he\u2019d thought at their initial meeting, and regardless of how uncomfortable it made him as a man, her perceptiveness was a skill he could utilize as a lieutenant. \u201cYou know much about what went down with the Human Alliance a year ago?\u201d</p><p>The Alliance had tried to plant bombs in San Francisco, attempted to kidnap Ashaya Aleine. Bo and his people, rebels from the group at the time, had made the stupid-ass mistake of kidnapping a young male from DarkRiver territory in an effort both to protect him and to gain the packs\u2019 attention. \u201cAbout Bowen and his group?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u201d\u2014Adria took another sip of her coffee\u2014\u201call senior soldiers were briefed. I know we\u2019ve been working with the cats to build a functional relationship with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been rocky,\u201d Riaz acknowledged, \u201cbut we knew we had to find some way to make things work.\u201d The Alliance\u2019s business standing had taken a hit immediately after the events in San Francisco, but as Hawke had predicted, it had rebounded even stronger.</p><p>Changelings have packs, the alpha had said. The Alliance is the human equivalent\u2014it not only represents humans as a group, it\u2019s powerful enough that people pay attention.</p><p>Not a body to disregard, regardless of the fact that humans were so often labeled the weakest part of the triumvirate that was the world.</p> <p>\u201cAre they breaking their side of their bargain,\u201d Adria asked, \u201ctrying something in our territory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but they\u2019ve been implicated in a set of assassinations in the Mediterranean.\u201d He pushed off the wall, decision made. \u201cI\u2019m going to call Bowen. Want to sit in?\u201d</p><p>Blue-violet eyes streaked with gold widened at the corners. \u201cYes, I would.\u201d</p><p>Coffees drunk and mugs washed, they headed toward the conference room. \u201cDoes the Alliance have people with the training to pull off something so clean, and we have to assume, fast?\u201d she asked after he finished summarizing the situation.</p><p>\u201cBo could\u2019ve done it. He worked in covert ops in the military arm of the Alliance before he decided he didn\u2019t like where that arm was heading under the previous leadership.\u201d Into a violence as cold and self-serving as that of the Council. \u201cIf it was the Alliance, I\u2019m more interested in the why.\u201d</p><p>Adria raised an eyebrow as they entered the conference room.</p><p>\u201cBo,\u201d he explained, \u201chas been very carefully rebuilding the Alliance\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this kind of violence, if it got out,\u201d Adria murmured, \u201cwould bring up too many ugly memories in the wider population.\u201d</p><p>He reached behind her to shut the door. \u201cGrab a seat out of camera range,\u201d he said, allowing her enigma of a scent to seep into his veins. \u201cI want you to act as a second set of ears and eyes\u2014Bo\u2019s very good at only giving away what he wants.\u201d</p><p>Choosing a seat that offered an excellent vantage point, Adria watched Riaz put through the call. His back to her, he couldn\u2019t see her, and so she allowed herself the indulgence of a lingering visual examination, her eyes drawn to his left shoulder and the jagged curves and lines of the tattoo hidden by his T-shirt. She loved the way the black ink looked against his skin, as she loved the muscled beauty of his frame, the way he moved when inside her.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t difficult to see why he intrigued her on the deepest level.</p><p>But though he was undeniably a sexy, handsome man, her wolf saw beauty through a different lens. It was drawn to his strength, his ease with himself\u2014and with her. Riaz wasn\u2019t bothered if she lost control during intimacy and drew a little blood, didn\u2019t care if she wanted to take the reins at times. When they\u2019d worked together during the battle with Pure Psy, he\u2019d given orders with cool, calm control even in the midst of chaos. The soldier in her respected him for that, while the woman found it another compelling aspect of his character.</p><p>However, she also understood that he\u2019d be maddening in a relationship. He wasn\u2019t simply a dominant predatory changeling male, a lieutenant, he was a lone wolf. It was legend how incredibly possessive and insanely protective a lone wolf became with the woman he claimed as his own\u2014as opposed to one with whom he\u2019d agreed to build a friendship based on a storm of shared need ... and shared pain.</p><p>\u201cTwo seconds,\u201d he said, those amazing eyes locking with her own. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>Her stomach clenched in visceral awareness. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is this?\u201d a rough male voice asked, accepting an audio-only transmission after the call rang for a quarter of a minute.</p><p>\u201cBo, it\u2019s Riaz.\u201d</p><p>A pause, the sound of sheets rustling. \u201cChrist, let me get out of bed,\u201d was the response, though it had to be midmorning in Venice.</p><p>\u201cLate night?\u201d Riaz asked.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately not the x-rated kind.\u201d A couple more seconds passed before Bo\u2019s face appeared on-screen. He\u2019d shaved off his hair, so he didn\u2019t have bed head, but his face was rumpled on one side, the smooth caramel brown of his skin carrying a fine sunburn ... as if he\u2019d been out on the water. \u201cThat was quick.\u201d Somber eyes that watched Riaz with piercing intensity.</p><p>Riaz didn\u2019t blink. \u201cYou know what this is about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can guess.\u201d Bo rubbed a hand over his smooth skull, the lines of his face masculine yet elegant\u2014a man who\u2019d be beautiful if not for the flinty hardness in his eyes, the ropes of muscle across his bare shoulders. \u201cI can\u2019t say anything on this line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s secure.\u201d</p><p>But Bowen shook his head, a stubborn angle to his jaw. \u201cHas to be face-to-face, and I\u2019m not planning on any travel right now.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back against the wall, Riaz folded his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re sounding paranoid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would, too, if you\u2019d just had the week I\u2019ve had. It\u2019ll only take you what\u201d\u2014Bo frowned\u2014\u201cthree hours on an express airjet to get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the best time for a SnowDancer lieutenant to leave the pack.\u201d Riaz held the Alliance male\u2019s gaze. \u201cWhat priority is your intel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh.\u201d No hesitation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Riaz. You want to hear what I have to say.\u201d Bowen signed off with those portentous words.</p><p>Waiting until the screen was clear, Adria said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you confirm a trip?\u201d He was right about the timing, but it was doable, wouldn\u2019t affect the strength of their defenses.</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s on the mark about the comm being monitored,\u201d Riaz said, blue-black strands of hair falling across his forehead, \u201cit\u2019s no use tipping off any listeners to the fact we\u2019ll be in the area.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse spiked. \u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need backup.\u201d Riaz saw Adria\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cSituation like this, I\u2019d usually ask my man already in the area, but he\u2019s got something else on his plate, and you speak fluent Italian.\u201d He knew it was the right decision, that her linguistic skill and status as an experienced soldier made her the perfect choice. He also knew he was treading a dangerous line. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Adria, when she rose to her feet, showed no indications of having read more into his suggestion than he meant. \u201cHow do you know that? The fact I speak Italian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job,\u201d he said. \u201cI keep track of anyone in the pack who has a skill that might come in useful internationally.\u201d Adria\u2019s CV had passed across his desk when she transferred. \u201cWhat I can\u2019t understand is why you chose to learn Italian when Spanish would\u2019ve been more useful in the region.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer, her next words telling him her mind was on something else altogether. \u201cI don\u2019t want to disrupt things so early on with my trainees.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt should only be a day or two.\u201d He knew how heavily the juveniles relied on their assigned supervisors.</p><p>A slow nod. \u201cThat\u2019s manageable. I was planning to ask Riley to put me on a high-perimeter shift anyway.\u201d Catching his questioning look, she said, \u201cThey might be submissives, but constant oversight isn\u2019t good for any wolf\u2019s development.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave early morning tomorrow,\u201d he said, wondering how a tough senior soldier understood SnowDancer\u2019s submissives so well. \u201cThat give you enough time to organize cover for your duties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Then to his surprise, she did a funny little dance around her chair, singing, \u201cI\u2019m going to Venice. I\u2019m going to Venice.\u201d</p><p>It startled laughter out of him, his wolf standing up in fascination at the unexpected and sweetly charming crack in Adria\u2019s sober facade. \u201cIf you\u2019re really good,\u201d he said when she stopped dancing to grin at him, \u201cI\u2019ll take you on a gondola ride through the canals.\u201d Delight, bright and dangerous, cascaded through his veins.</p> <p>Chapter 37</p><p>HAVING COMPLETED HIS research, Vasquez located the first three addresses fast enough, but it took hours of hacking through Net firewalls to unearth the second three, and four days to complete the list. Psychically exhausted, he considered sending the one he served an e-mail with the update, but they had agreed on electronic and psychic silence. Nothing of their plan was going to leak and jeopardize everything they had set so meticulously in place.</p><p>Conscious that tiredness could lead to mistakes, Vasquez slept long enough to become functional, then made his way to the compound hidden deep in a rural sector of Ireland. \u201cI have the coordinates and necessary images of the first set of targets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen can we move?\u201d The voice was a rasp, a broken saw, issuing from a throat that had suffered second-degree burns when Henry Scott screamed as his legs were turned to ash, one of his arms sliced below the elbow by a whip of cold fire.</p><p>The medics had been working to repair the damage, but it was severe. Sienna Lauren\u2019s X-fire had cauterized the wounds, so they\u2019d needed to be cut open vein by vein to allow for the regeneration aids to work. However, the worst damage had been done when a Pure Psy operative shoved his body over Henry\u2019s in an effort to protect him. That operative\u2019s weapon had melted into the former Councilor\u2019s flesh.</p><p>It was proving near impossible to excise the plas from his body, some of it appearing to have integrated into his organs. As a result, Henry remained hooked up to multiple devices, his body supine on a hospital bed inside a large chamber of sterile glass, his ruined voice issuing via a speaker. However, the fire had done nothing to his mind, and they were Psy. The mind was all that mattered.</p> <p>\u201cAre we in a position to strike?\u201d Henry elaborated, his bloodshot eyes looking at Vasquez through the glass.</p><p>\u201cI recommend waiting until we have at least ten complete sets.\u201d It would allow them to strike back to back, leaving no time or room for a counterstrike. However, it all depended on whether Vasquez could muster enough trusted personnel with the right abilities.</p><p>Loud, rattling breaths. \u201cThe Net is becoming weaker with each day that passes, filled with those whose Silence is flawed. We need to remind them of who we are as a race.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but our chances of success rise exponentially if we act without any warning.\u201d Giving the enemy no time to prepare before the avalanche.</p><p>Henry took a long time to reply, his breathing so rough Vasquez knew this interview would soon end. \u201cFive sets,\u201d the former Councilor said at last. \u201cFive complete sets and one outlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA small location, a demonstration of what we can do ahead of the primary hits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA test to ascertain the validity of our refined method?\u201d Their earlier plan had proven to have a fatal flaw, so he could agree with the precaution, except that it risked tipping their hand.</p> <p>But Henry said, \u201cIf those in the Net want to feel, then perhaps we should teach them the taste of terror.\u201d</p><p>Vasquez would never betray the only man who appeared to be taking the disintegration of Silence not as an inevitability but as a disease that needed to be stopped, but he was also not a cipher who followed Henry\u2019s every command. \u201cWe chance losing the element of surprise,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could lead to the primary targets being sequestered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it not be better,\u201d Henry said, \u201cif we did not have to act against those targets? Perhaps one demonstration is all that will be needed.\u201d</p><p>Vasquez considered the question, realized his leader was right. This strategy was not one they had agreed to lightly\u2014it went against the founding tenets of Pure Psy. However, it was a proven fact that those who adapted to altered circumstances were the ones who survived. \u201cOne outlier,\u201d he said, already weighing up suitable possibilities. \u201cIf we are to hold to the timetable, I must get back to my duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d A pause. \u201cVasquez?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have been loyal. I won\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPurity will save us, sir.\u201d Vasquez\u2019s ancestors before Silence had been murderers and sociopaths. Silence was his salvation. \u201cI\u2019ll set things in motion.\u201d</p><p>Everyone, no matter their location or race, had a Psy neighbor, colleague, or business acquaintance. When Pure Psy rose this time, it wasn\u2019t only the Psy who would learn the meaning of fear.</p><p>Chapter 38</p><p>RIAZ STEPPED OFF the watercraft he and Adria had boarded to reach Venice after the airjet landed in nearby Marco Polo Airport, both of them carrying small duffel bags. It was temperate this time of year, the air around them dusky with the oncoming sunset, the soft light burnishing the old stone of the buildings that remained above the waterline.</p><p>As a result of changing water levels in the Adriatic and an undersea quake that had badly damaged the wooden foundations on which Venice stood, much of the jewel of a city was now underwater, though some of its iconic, graceful bridges survived, a few marooned in the midst of wide canals. However, instead of sinking into obscurity, Venice remained a vibrant, living city as a result of its complex network of biospheres below the waterline.</p><p>The spheres had been developed by a consortium of water-based changelings and put into place during the final decade of the twentieth century. A large number of BlackSea\u2019s people still called Venice home, but Riaz\u2019s wolf found the old city claustrophobic, especially beneath the surface, where the biospheres acted as\u2014to his mind\u2014protective prisons.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated by Venice.\u201d Adria did a full circle on the \u201cfloating\u201d roadway designed to rise with the water, her eyes taking in everything with unhidden wonder. \u201cIt\u2019s filled with so much history you can almost hear the city whisper it to you.\u201d</p><p>Painful though his memories of Venice were, it was impossible not to be affected by the infectious depth of her joy. \u201cYou should see it during Carnevale.\u201d It was just before the last Carnevale that he\u2019d first seen Lisette, and he\u2019d been unable to stop himself from seeking her out during the celebrations.</p><p>Standing in the shadows created by the alcove of a moss-covered building, his face concealed by a half mask, he\u2019d watched her lithe figure swirl in her husband\u2019s arms, both of them full of the wild energy that came from the beautiful chaos of the festival. She\u2019d been dressed in red and black, a Spanish flamenco dancer transplanted onto Venetian soil, her sun gold hair dyed a vivid black.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on my list.\u201d Adria\u2019s slightly husky voice broke into his thoughts, so very different from Lisette\u2019s French-accented soprano. \u201cAlong with Mardi Gras in New Orleans, the Inca Trail, the Taj Ma\u2014\u201d Her eyes connecting with his, she cut herself off midstream, a slight wash of color on her cheekbones. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m talking your ear off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, tell me.\u201d Struck once more by how much he didn\u2019t know about her, he found himself fascinated.</p><p>\u201cHow about you tell me,\u201d she said instead, cocking her head a little to the side as they detoured to drop their bags off at the hotel. \u201cYou were away for a long time. Tell me some of the places you visited, the things you saw.\u201d</p><p>Riaz shoved a hand through his hair, thinking back. Though he had been based in Europe, he\u2019d traveled through Asia and parts of Africa, had adventures that had thrilled and changed him in different ways. \u201cI once got caught in the monsoon rains in India,\u201d he said, choosing a memory he knew would make her laugh, because when Adria laughed ... the edges inside him gentled, hurt less. \u201cThe human part of me loved it, but my wolf was not impressed.\u201d He shuddered, as if flinging water off his fur.</p><p>Adria\u2019s laughter held her own wolf\u2019s amusement, the fine streaks of gold in her eyes glittering in the deep orange light of the setting sun. \u201cI can imagine. Did you make it to Nepal, see Kathmandu?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI was on my way there when I was recalled to Rome to take care of some pack business.\u201d He\u2019d met Lisette not much later, and the ensuing months had torn him bloody, until he\u2019d had to go home to the den deep in the Sierra Nevada mountains, where he could lick his wounds surrounded by the warmth of his pack.</p><p>He still needed that warmth, that connection, but felt no lack today, though he was far from his heartland. It wasn\u2019t hard to understand why, with Adria walking long-legged and happy beside him, her pleasure in Venice as open and as unhidden as the heart of her wolf. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No ties. No promises.</p><p>Yet, in spite of the vow they\u2019d taken, ties were forming. Ties of friendship, of need, of respect. Whenever this relationship ended, those bonds would remain. Riaz\u2019s wolf was pensive about that, but it didn\u2019t reject the idea out of hand\u2014Adria wasn\u2019t just Pack now, wasn\u2019t just a lover with whom he\u2019d shared skin privileges. She\u2019d become someone who mattered to both sides of his nature, part of his own personal \u201cpack\u201d of people.</p><p>His to protect.</p> <p>BOWEN was waiting for them outside an unassuming seventeenth-century building half submerged by the rising waters that had permanently flooded the Venetian lagoon, the bridge that had once linked it to another, larger building long gone, leaving it an island at the end of the road, the shimmer of water beyond. The leader of the Human Alliance held out a hand. \u201cRiaz, good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBo.\u201d Shaking the proffered hand, he said, \u201cThis is Adria.\u201d</p><p>Bowen\u2019s smile changed, into the kind a man gives a woman who\u2019d caught his attention. \u201cWelcome to Venezia, Adria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The cool remoteness of her response made Riaz realize how long it had been since he\u2019d heard that tone from her. His wolf\u2019s smug pride had his lips tugging up at the corners.</p> <p>\u201cCome on in.\u201d Bowen led them through the doors of the apparently small building that housed the Alliance offices, down the carpeted front hallway, and into an elevator.</p><p>Riaz spotted six security cameras, five obvious guards, and at least three concealed ones he discerned only because of his sense of smell. That was on top of a laser-alarm system and the prettily dressed receptionist with the eyes of an assassin. He didn\u2019t even think before positioning himself so that Adria was protected by the heavy bulk of his body. He saw her sharp look, caught the tiny nod. Rather than fighting his subtly protective stance, she focused her own attention on covering his blind spots.</p><p>\u201cExpecting company?\u201d he asked Bo once they were in the elevator.</p><p>The other man leaned back against the wall, folding his arms over a black T-shirt that said, \u201cJust because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not out to get you.\u201d The quote was amusing, the way he bared his teeth less a smile than a feral display akin to that of a wolf. \u201cSomething like that. We\u2019ll talk inside,\u201d he said as the elevator doors opened. \u201cI had some food brought in.\u201d</p><p>Stepping out into the biosphere-protected part of Venice made Adria\u2019s shoulders slump in disappointment, though her eyes never lost their alert watchfulness. \u201cIt\u2019s no different from the aboveground city,\u201d she whispered in a sub-vocal murmur he had to lean down to hear, her breath a caress across his jaw.</p><p>\u201cBe patient.\u201d He knew what was coming, his wolf quivering in anticipation as it waited to see her response.</p> <p>\u201cIn here.\u201d Bo pushed open a door.</p><p>Adria froze in the doorway, her eyes huge.</p><p>\u201cMore like what you expected?\u201d he murmured in her ear, nudging her forward with a caressing stroke of his hand on her lower back.</p><p>Clearly captivated by the meeting room that, at first glance, seemed suspended over nothing but water, she walked slowly inside. The Alliance building was on the very edge of the city, which meant it was possible to actually see the water lapping at the biosphere from a number of lower-floor rooms. Located in a corner, with three glass walls, this one was the most magnificent\u2014it created the illusion of the clear blue-green water touching the glass, when the actual curve of the biosphere was several meters away.</p><p>As if putting on a show, a pod of sleek silvery fish darted across that water, their scales catching the sunlight from above.</p><p>Not saying a word, Adria crossed the deep green of the carpet to look through the windows into the water. Up close, Riaz knew the view was bisected on the right side by the remnants of neighboring buildings that had sunk and deteriorated pre-Restoration, as well as by the wooden pilings on which those buildings had once stood, but flawlessly clear on the side that faced out into the lagoon.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s damn beautiful,\u201d Bowen said, and it was a question.</p><p>Riaz\u2019s response was instinctive. \u201cShe\u2019s taken.\u201d Neither part of him cared that the agreement he\u2019d made with Adria gave him no rights of possession.</p> <p>\u201cLucky bastard, whoever he is.\u201d An oblique glance.</p><p>Adria turned at that moment, the light from the water playing over the clean angles of her face, the light-shot amber of her eyes a silent indication of her wolf\u2019s fascination with this strange city. \u201cI\u2019d go insane living here, but for a visit, yes, it\u2019s a sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should see the view during a storm.\u201d Bo walked over to the conference table already set with sandwiches, water, fruit, and cookies, urging them to take a seat. \u201cEven some of the folks who live and work here can\u2019t handle it. The reminder that there\u2019s not much between Venice and oblivion cuts too deep into the bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like it.\u201d Adria\u2019s voice had thawed a fraction, her lush mouth soft with the faintest of smiles.</p><p>Bowen cheeks creased into a deep smile in return. \u201cYes. She\u2019s a stunning lady, my Venezia.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s wolf bristled at the hint of flirtation in the male\u2019s voice, but he managed to remain polite as they each grabbed some food. \u201cSo,\u201d he said, once everyone had had a chance to take a few bites, \u201cwhy the intense paranoia?\u201d</p><p>Swiveling in his chair, a cookie in hand, Bo used a sleek black remote to bring up an image on the comm screen behind him. It was of a middle-aged man, a little pudgy and altogether harmless looking. \u201cOne of our senior comm specialists.\u201d He dropped the cookie onto his plate, his jaw a hard line. \u201cWe found out two weeks ago that the Psy broke and programmed him.\u201d</p><p>ADRIA pushed aside her plate, appetite lost. \u201cDid he survive?\u201d Brainwashing was hard on Psy minds from what she\u2019d picked up from the Laurens, but it was brutal on changelings, involving as it did the shattering of their strong natural shields. With humans, it could go either way, since their natural shields were so weak as to be nonexistent\u2014but their brains also weren\u2019t built to take that kind of psychic pressure.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on life support.\u201d Bo\u2019s tone was bleak. \u201cWe\u2019re trying everything we can to give him a shot, but...\u201d Rubbing his jaw, he took a deep breath, and when he next spoke, the bleakness had been replaced by anger. \u201cHe was\u2014is\u2014a good man, fought hard not to give in to the compulsions. The doctors say he had to have suffered constant nosebleeds, worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he failed,\u201d Riaz said, his anger a quiet, dangerous thing that spoke to her own. \u201cThat he compromised your comm system from the inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThing is,\u201d Bo said, \u201cReuben can\u2019t tell us what he did or didn\u2019t do\u2014by the time we discovered what the bastards had done to him, he\u2019d lapsed into a coma.\u201d He shifted his chair sideways, so he could see the comm screen and them at the same time. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of ripping out and reinstalling every single piece of comm equipment on-site. Software and hardware. Until that\u2019s complete, we\u2019re in total shutdown on any but the most general conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCell phones?\u201d Riaz asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re replacing the whole lot\u2014Reuben was the one who issued them to us.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNew ones are supposed to arrive today for the techs to pull apart and check.\u201d</p><p>Adria agreed with the precautions, extreme though they might seem. Only a fool would consider the Psy race a nonthreat. \u201cDo you have any idea who orchestrated the attack on Reuben?\u201d It was easy to generalize the Psy as the enemy, but the psychic race ran the gamut from the innocent to the evil, same as changelings and humans.</p><p>Bo\u2019s expression turned brutal, stripped bare of any lingering trace of the charm he\u2019d earlier displayed. A quick touch of the remote and the image of Reuben was replaced by that of a woman with cheekbones that could cut glass. Her hair was a deep, luxuriant mahogany, her skin slightly olive toned, her eyes an acute hazel-green.</p><p>\u201cTatiana Rika-Smythe.\u201d Ice in every syllable. \u201cShe\u2019s not as flashy as some of the other Councilors\u2014this one\u2019s more like a snake in the grass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound certain.\u201d Adria had been in the upper hierarchy of the pack long enough to know that Councilors had a way of working machinations behind machinations.</p><p>Bo discarded Tatiana\u2019s photo for another image, that of the yacht that had started everything. It sat adrift in the ocean. \u201cAsk me why I was on that yacht in the middle of the fucking Mediterranean with seven Psy guards.\u201d</p><p>Adria\u2019s claws sliced out, threatening to mark the gleaming wood of the table. \u201cThey planned to break you, too.\u201d It took conscious effort to retract her claws\u2014Riaz had kept control over his own, but his eyes were a hypnotic, dangerous gold.</p><p>Bo took several minutes to reply, clearly fighting the rage that had caused white lines to appear around his mouth, carved into the warm hue of his skin. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to think that that\u2019s what happened to the old chairman,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt would explain why he suddenly started making those bullshit calls\u2014at the time, we all hated him. Now ... I pity the poor bastard.\u201d Running a hand over the smooth curve of his skull, he grabbed a bottle of water, slugging back half of it before he spoke again. \u201cOne of them stunned me while I was walking home around nine at night. When I woke up, I was on the yacht.\u201d</p><p>It was a plausible story\u2014especially since it involved a male who, like all strong men, didn\u2019t think anything could touch him, but something didn\u2019t ring true. \u201cYou\u2019re not the official head of the Alliance,\u201d she said, never moving her eyes off his face.</p><p>\u201cThe chairman position is now largely administrative.\u201d Bo shrugged off her implied question, his expression betraying nothing. \u201cJust means Rika-Smythe has good sources of information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me,\u201d she insisted, conscious of Riaz going very still beside her, \u201cthat you were arrogant enough to go out alone after dark when you\u2019d already discovered what had been done to Reuben, knew the Psy might be out to mess with you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Bo\u2019s smile was slow and dangerous. \u201cSmart and sexy\u2014my perfect woman.\u201d He finished off the water. \u201cWe were working on the assumption that with Reuben down, someone else with his level of access to our systems would be a target. We made sure everyone who qualified was covered ... except for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaying bait?\u201d Riaz tapped his fingers on the table. \u201cNo way for you to know you\u2019d be able to handle the operatives who captured you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t stupid bait,\u201d Bo said with an offended snort. \u201cHad a GPS tracker implanted an inch below my armpit, where pretty much nobody ever thinks to check. We also had a team in the air above me the entire time.\u201d</p> <p>The man had guts, Adria thought. Because air support or not, he\u2019d been on his own on that yacht. \u201cYou weren\u2019t worried about psychic coercion?\u201d</p><p>A small pause before Riaz whistled. \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d His tone was a mix of admiration and disbelief. \u201cYou did it, you actually figured out how to make that chip work.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 39</p><p>IT HAD BEEN after their first run-in with the Alliance that the pack had discovered the group had been experimenting with a chip that, once implanted, acted as a shield against Psy intrusion. Or that had been the official line fed to the Alliance\u2019s soldiers. In truth, the original chips had acted as remote kill switches.</p><p>Bo\u2019s smile was grimly satisfied. \u201cHell, yes.\u201d</p> <p>Riaz was impressed, but he needed the answer to another question before he could ask Bo for more information on the chip. \u201cDoes Ashaya Aleine know?\u201d The scientist was one of the most experienced people in the world when it came to neural implants, and had\u2014when the dust settled after the aborted kidnapping\u2014agreed to help Bo and his people fix the defective chip. If she, and by extension, DarkRiver, had known of the Alliance\u2019s success and not shared the information, the shit was going to hit the fan. Hard enough to cover everyone.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Bowen sliced his hand through the air, his tone leaving no room for doubt. \u201cHer help was critical, and not one of us will ever be anything but grateful, but she\u2019s not Alliance, wouldn\u2019t keep our secrets.\u201d A blunt answer. \u201cThe most recent prototype we sent her was created from one of the earlier designs. We figured we\u2019d share the truth once we were ready for the packs to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe yacht incident pushed things ahead of schedule,\u201d Riaz guessed, his wolf relaxing now that he didn\u2019t have to inform his alpha that a member of the pack that was their most trusted ally had breached their alliance. Beside him, he sensed the tension drain out of Adria, too.</p><p>\u201cWe voted to give Ashaya a twenty-five percent stake in the patent,\u201d Bo said after nodding an affirmative to Riaz\u2019s statement. \u201cA patent we\u2019ll be filing for when hell freezes over, so Aleine owns a percentage in a design that\u2019ll never make any profit. The only important thing is getting the chip into as many humans as possible. Being protected from mental violation shouldn\u2019t be a luxury.\u201d</p><p>Riaz was unsurprised at the secrecy, but Bo\u2019s confidence in the success of the implant seemed premature.</p><p>Adria echoed his thoughts, the delicate wildness of her scent licking over him as she leaned forward on the table. \u201cI don\u2019t see people lining up to be implanted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLot of trust if they are,\u201d Riaz added, restraining the urge to run his hand slowly down the arch of her back, displayed so beautifully by her current position.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking from a changeling perspective,\u201d Bo said, the passion in his eyes an inferno. \u201cHumans ... you have no idea what it\u2019s like to walk around knowing one of the Psy could slip into your mind at any time and take things, or plant things. It\u2019s rape and it\u2019s a violation committed over and over and over again against people who can\u2019t fight back.\u201d Flat, hard words. \u201cA human makes a technological breakthrough, and the next thing you know, the Psy already have a patent on the invention. Just coincidence.\u201d His laugh was bitter. \u201cThat\u2019s if they choose to leave the human\u2019s memories intact so he or she even knows what\u2019s been stolen.\u201d</p><p>Fisting his hand on the table, he blew out a breath, his next statement not as drenched in anger. \u201cThe initial rollout was soft, limited only to Alliance personnel I personally vetted. Reuben wasn\u2019t on the list. If he had been...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s done and gone. Fact is, the Psy are going to find out about it sooner or later, so we\u2019ve begun an Alliance-wide operation. Everyone who wants a chip gets one.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing Riaz could say to that, every word Bo had spoken an ugly truth. But SnowDancer understood his sense of violation in a way the other man couldn\u2019t comprehend. Psy had broken so many of their strongest two decades ago, almost destroyed the pack. Riaz had been a juvenile, but he would never forget the blood, the loss ... and the lethal determination in the eyes of the boy with hair of silver-gold who had become their alpha while barely more than a child.</p><p>Riaz saw the same unyielding determination on Bo\u2019s face. Whatever it took, whatever the personal cost, he knew Bo wouldn\u2019t flinch, not if it meant protecting his people. \u201cDid you go first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way I was going to ask my men and women to do something I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Adria\u2019s husky voice brushed over Riaz\u2019s skin, snagging his attention. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a chip in the back of your neck. Did you change the location?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s there. Covered by a dermal patch that blends into my skin.\u201d He jerked his head toward Adria, challenge and flirtation both in the faint smile on his lips. \u201cYou can feel it if you like.\u201d</p> <p>Once again, Riaz\u2019s wolf flashed its canines but held its silence, well aware Bo was jerking his chain. Nonetheless, his focus was acute and deadly as he watched the woman who was his lover walk to stand behind Bo\u2019s chair.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Reaching back, he tapped a spot.</p><p>Unable to see any difference in the honey brown of his skin tone, Adria pressed the pad of her finger over the warmth of his nape. The hardness was slight, but when she traced around the area, she realized it formed a small square. Looking at Riaz, she nodded, startled by the way the wolf watched her out of those eyes. Throat suddenly dry, she had to break the eye contact, clear her throat, before she could speak. \u201cCould be a dummy.\u201d</p><p>Bo shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m sane and alive after being taken captive by seven Psy. Think about it.\u201d</p><p>She had, and in spite of her words, her instinct was to believe him.</p><p>Riaz placed his arm on the back of her chair as soon as she retook her seat, his attention on Bo, but his fingers just brushing her hair. Her heart slammed into her ribs, because subtle though it might be, she understood it for a possessive display\u2014it was the first time he\u2019d ever done anything of the sort in public, a warning of the notorious lone-wolf tendency toward possessiveness. The thing was, Adria had never expected him to train that aspect of his personality on her.</p><p>She was still trying to work out how to respond to the unexpected act when he spoke, his voice creeping under her skin to touch parts of her it had no business touching.</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t ask Ashaya to help you test the implant,\u201d he asked, eyes that had returned to their human shade locked on Bowen, \u201cwho did you trust enough to do the testing?\u201d</p><p>Bowen took his time answering. \u201cWe heard about the Laurens,\u201d he said when he did speak, his expression giving nothing away. \u201cAbout how they\u2019ve been alive all this time. How\u2019d they do it? A familial net?\u201d</p><p>Adria leaned forward in excitement, inadvertently breaking the contact with Riaz. \u201cAnother family of defectors?\u201d</p><p>However Bowen shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d Another pause. \u201cLet\u2019s just call them a well-organized group.\u201d His expression made it clear he\u2019d share no other details of their identity. \u201cThey dropped out of the Net in degrees, changed their appearance, and blended into the population. No one would\u2019ve been the wiser, except that one of them was injured in a freak accident six months ago\u2014hit by bricks falling onto the street from a building undergoing maintenance.\u201d</p><p>Adria found herself sliding back into her seat, her skin burning at the renewed contact with Riaz\u2019s fingers.</p><p>\u201cI saw him trying to limp away,\u201d Bo continued. \u201cI\u2019m certain he wouldn\u2019t normally have said a word, but he was concussed at the time, and kept repeating \u2018no DNA profile\u2019 as I was leading him to the ambulance. I figured he had a criminal warrant out on him, but then he mumbled the word \u2018PsyNet.\u2019\u201d A shrug. \u201cI did what any good security chief would do. I brought him here, had him patched up, and interrogated him while he was still dopey.\u201d</p><p>A ruthless act\u2014but then, from what Adria knew of him, Bo had never pretended to be anything else when it came to taking care of his people. The wolf in her respected that, even as it understood that the Alliance man would betray even the staunchest ally if it came down to a choice between that ally and those he considered under his protection.</p><p>\u201cBy the time his friends tracked him down,\u201d he said, \u201cwe knew who they were and that blackmailing them would be a very bad idea, so we simply suggested that our interests might mesh and let it go at that.\u201d</p><p>An intelligent and calculated decision, from a man Riaz had seen leak charm like a tap in a successful effort to divert people\u2019s attention from his cold-eyed intelligence. \u201cYou\u2019ve got balls, I\u2019ll give you that.\u201d</p><p>Bowen\u2019s grin was a flash of canines. \u201cThe reason we know it was Tatiana behind the attack on Reuben,\u201d he said, grin vanishing as quickly as it had appeared, \u201cwas that the men who were sent to take me in didn\u2019t bother to hide the comm conversation they had with her once I was onboard, even though the stun had worn off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareless.\u201d Riaz traced circles on Adria\u2019s nape with the tip of his finger.</p><p>\u201cThey figured I wouldn\u2019t be in a position to say anything after she got through with me.\u201d Bracing his forearms on the gleaming wood of the table, Bo bit out his next words. \u201cThe bitch does her own reprogramming\u2014she made it clear no one else was to touch me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Considering the facts, Riaz made the tactical decision to share some knowledge. \u201cTatiana is thought to have the ability to penetrate almost any shield.\u201d</p><p>Bo\u2019s pupils contracted. \u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No way of knowing if the chip would\u2019ve held her off, since it\u2019s technological, not natural,\u201d Riaz said, \u201cbut seems she can get into most minds without causing major damage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLess scars to hide,\u201d Adria said, and he heard the empathy in her, the soft heart she hid beneath the tough exterior.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he added, cupping her nape gently with his hand, \u201cTatiana\u2019s ability is noteworthy because of how unusual it is, so it doesn\u2019t change the impact of the chip. Still, your people need to make sure they don\u2019t get cocky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce you take away their psychic advantage,\u201d Adria said into the silence that had fallen after Bo\u2019s curt nod, \u201cPsy are very vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>As, Riaz mused, Bowen had proven with deadly efficiency on the yacht.</p> <p>\u201cThey have a tendency to rely on their abilities,\u201d the human male agreed. \u201cThe ones I took down on the yacht were armed, but they paid so little attention to me it was the easiest op I\u2019ve ever completed. A single guard on the door?\u201d He snorted. \u201cSoon as I had his weapon, it was all over. None of the others were on alert because they assumed their telepathic sweeps would warn them of an intruder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy kill them?\u201d Adria\u2019s question betrayed the inherent compassion of her nature. \u201cWhy not simply incapacitate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA message,\u201d Riaz answered, the predator in him recognizing the one who sat three feet away. \u201cHe was sending a message. They fuck with the Alliance, you aren\u2019t going to take prisoners.\u201d</p><p>A small shrug from Bowen, his jet-black eyes steely with lethal purpose. \u201cLeaving them alive would\u2019ve been a sign of weakness, and Tatiana expects weakness from the \u2018emotional\u2019 races. What the bitch doesn\u2019t understand is that rage is an emotion, too.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 40</p><p>HAVING SPENT TWO hours with Bowen, going over the advantages the artificial shields might present the humans in SnowDancer and in the packs of their allies, Riaz reported in to Hawke via a highly secure satellite comm link set up using equipment at a small SnowDancer office hidden in Venice. Though the office was unmanned except for when Pierce was in the city, it had multiple layers of security not even a teleporter could breach without setting off a silent alarm. Not that they\u2019d find much except some expensive comm equipment\u2014the call history was set to erase itself the second after a user signed out.</p> <p>\u201cBo says he couriered Ashaya the final chip earlier today, after making the decision to let us in on the secret,\u201d he told his alpha. \u201cHave her test it as well as she can.\u201d Riaz wasn\u2019t certain how far the scientist could go without implanting it in anyone, but it was worth a shot. \u201cNo way I\u2019m taking Bo\u2019s word on the effectiveness of the technology.\u201d</p><p>Hawke nodded, and Riaz could almost see him weighing up every possible variable before he said, \u201cI also want to send Judd in, test the one Bo has in him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured. Bo\u2019s expecting it.\u201d</p><p>Hawke glanced to the side, his head cocked at a listening angle. Turning back to Riaz after a couple of seconds, he said, \u201cJudd won\u2019t be able to get there until tomorrow night. You okay to stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He turned to the woman beside him. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Adria nodded and spoke directly to Hawke. \u201cI cleared two days just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if you hadn\u2019t,\u201d Hawke said, the wolf\u2019s laughter suddenly in his eyes, \u201cRiley\u2019s so happy right now, he\u2019s granting leave to anyone who asks. I\u2019m half afraid to turn around and find the entire den has left for the Bahamas.\u201d</p><p>They all grinned at the idea of solid, stable Riley in a spin of joy. Riaz couldn\u2019t imagine it happening to a better man. \u201cHe drive Mercy to violence yet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot so far, but I have popcorn for when the show begins.\u201d</p><p>Signing off after another round of laughter, Riaz and Adria reset the office\u2019s security and left via an ingenious passageway that spilled them out into a small but busy shopping district.</p><p>The walk to the hotel was quick, the streets around them swathed in velvet darkness broken by the twinkling lights from several eateries spilling warm conversation onto the street. \u201cDinner on the balcony?\u201d he suggested as they entered their second-floor room.</p><p>Adria lit up.</p><p>And something in him gentled, wild tenderness invading his veins. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He picked up the room service menu.</p><p>TIPPING the waiter at the door, Riaz took the food out to the balcony himself. The temperature had cooled but remained comfortable, the night below dotted with pretty colored lights from a nearby restaurant, the golden-hued windows of another small hotel, the old-fashioned streetlights. Not far in the distance, water danced black and silken through a canal.</p><p>Pouring two glasses of wine, he handed one to Adria. \u201cTo Venice.\u201d</p><p>She clinked her glass to his, her hair tumbling around her shoulders. \u201cTo Venice.\u201d</p><p>It almost felt as if they\u2019d made a vow ... but to what, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>The food was simple but the flavor satisfied, as did the darkly romantic music lilting up from an evening busker. Wineglass in hand after they\u2019d eaten, the wine midnight rubies in the muted light, Riaz watched Adria. She\u2019d twisted in her chair to cross her arms on the curlicued metal of the railing, her face tilted into the soft wind and her ear cocked to the music. All her cares seemed to have vanished, the hardness created by life gone, until her beauty was exquisite, the lines of her face elegant and graceful.</p><p>This, he thought, this was who she was beneath the wariness and the hurt and the shields. A woman who, he suddenly knew, would tell him truths the other Adria never would. Dangerous though it was, this tightrope he was walking, he put down his wine and held out a hand. \u201cDance?\u201d</p><p>A startled look, the gold streaks in her eyes vivid in the dark ... her wolf coming to the surface. But she stood, flowed into his arms, one of her hands at his nape, the other locked with his own as he wrapped his free arm around her waist. She was tall enough that he didn\u2019t have to bend, didn\u2019t have to do anything but step closer. Their bodies aligned in sweet perfection, her head coming to just below his chin.</p><p>A faultless fit.</p><p>Drawing in the hidden notes of earthy warmth in her scent, he moved to the sway of the music, his blood hot, his body ready. But neither part of him was in any rush. He\u2019d rushed too much with Adria, always been in too much need. Tonight, that need was tempered by the sexual pride of a dominant male, the desire to show her the lover he could be when his head wasn\u2019t messed up.</p><p>The fact it wasn\u2019t, even though he stood in Venice, where it had all begun, was because of her, this strong, guarded, complicated woman turned into a lazy-limbed goddess in his arms. He couldn\u2019t quite understand how it had happened, how he had come to trust that she would never betray his secrets, but he did. So when she lifted her face to his, long fingertips stroking his nape, he bent his head and met her kiss halfway.</p><p>Hot and lush and open, it was a languid tangling of mouths. The softness of her, the curves, the lean strength, it all intoxicated. Her scent was in his every breath, and he wondered if she was becoming embedded in his skin, becoming part of him. It happened with lovers\u2014he\u2019d fought the change, not wanting another woman\u2019s scent on his skin ... but his wolf didn\u2019t claw away the idea this time.</p><p>Painful as it was, the wild heart of him had accepted what could never be, though he couldn\u2019t yet forget. But it wasn\u2019t simply that, would never have been enough. Man and wolf both, they were fascinated by the enigma of Adria. The courage he\u2019d witnessed under fire was only a single facet of a complex gemstone. Already, he knew her harsh, prickly surface to be a facade, the woman underneath one who understood SnowDancer\u2019s most vulnerable ... and who knew how to offer comfort to a broken male without unmanning him.</p><p>Spreading his hand on her lower back, he urged her closer. \u201cDo you know what the words to the song mean?\u201d he asked as the busker began to sing a song in Venesi\u00e0n, a language Riaz had made an effort to pick up during his time in Europe.</p><p>She shook her head, strands of ebony silk catching against his unshaven jaw. \u201cIt sounds beautiful, though.\u201d</p><p>Nuzzling at her, he began to translate, their clasped hands held against his chest. Her sigh at the poignant emotion of the romantic ballad was eloquent, the lips she pressed to the dip at the base of his throat lush and inviting. It stroked a low, deep sound of pleasure from him, his body primed. \u201cStop that if you want me to keep translating.\u201d</p><p>A teasing feminine chuckle. \u201cI\u2019ll behave.\u201d</p><p>Riaz murmured the words to her until the song ended, the busker\u2019s voice replaced by the sweet sounds of his fingers caressing the strings of his guitar.</p><p>\u201cWe should tip him.\u201d She moved the hand at his nape down to curve over his shoulder, her breath blowing a delicate kiss across his skin when she spoke.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go down?\u201d</p><p>She looked up, violet eyes lit by amber. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Fingers tangled, they left the room and made their way to the busker. The tip they dropped into his open guitar case made him grin. \u201cCome,\u201d he invited with a flourish of chords, \u201cdance!\u201d</p><p>Adria\u2019s smile was shy. \u201cWould you like to?\u201d</p><p>Riaz had his arms back around her before he realized he was moving, the familiar cobbled streets of Venice made new by her laughter as she navigated the uneven surface high enough to have escaped the flooding, her fingers tightening on his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>His wolf, so long trapped in pain and confusion, pressed against her, happy. Sliding his hand down her back, he danced with her under the half moon, barely aware of passersby until an older Italian couple, the woman\u2019s hair a luxurious mink streaked with gray, her mate\u2019s face lined with age and life, swirled in to join them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The dark truth he carried inside him struggled to awaken in the face of their unspoken bond, but the night was too beautiful to mar with regrets. Man and wolf, he focused every part of himself on dancing with the captivating woman in his arms. He didn\u2019t know how long they swayed in the sultry warmth, but when they drew apart, it was in silent agreement. Leaving the other dancers, they walked back to their room, the music following them upstairs.</p><p>He\u2019d left the balcony doors partly open, and the gauzy curtains floated in the gentle breeze. Keeping the lights off to assure their privacy, he ran his fingers over Adria\u2019s cheek, luxuriating in the warm smoothness of her skin. \u201cNo,\u201d he said when she went to take off her T-shirt. \u201cLet me.\u201d Running his hand down the curves of her body, he drew up the soft fabric with slow anticipation.</p><p>SHE was being seduced, Adria thought, as Riaz gripped her hips and pressed a kiss to the bared skin of her breastbone, her T-shirt having crumpled soundlessly on the rich cream of the carpet.</p> <p>\u201cYou taste like berries,\u201d he murmured, kissing his way up the slope of her neck. \u201cRipe, lush, juicy.\u201d</p><p>Except for when he\u2019d asked about her fantasies, he\u2019d never before spoken much in bed. The deep timbre of his voice hazed her mind, his callused skin on her own threatening to tangle what threads of reason remained. \u201cYou never told me your fantasy,\u201d she whispered against his mouth.</p><p>He angled his face to rub his jaw delicately against her cheek, his thumbs shaping the vee of her hip bones. \u201cA strong, sexy woman in my bed, mine to do with as I wish. You.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very dominant male fantasy.\u201d</p><p>Sensual amusement in his eyes, he just looked at her.</p> <p>She laughed, though her pulse was a staccato drumbeat. \u201cYes, why am I surprised?\u201d</p><p>His kiss was as slow, as romantic as the night, the kind of kiss a man might give to a new lover he was wooing into his bed. \u201cLet me,\u201d he whispered again, unhooking her bra to pull it off and drop it onto her T-shirt before pressing her against him again, big hands splayed on her back in a way that shouted possession. \u201cLet me.\u201d A kiss pressed to the sensitive spot behind her ear.</p><p>Shuddering, she wove her fingers into the thick silk of his hair, willing to be petted and caressed and adored enough to surrender the reins to this man she trusted not to betray her faith.</p><p>It had been so long.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was the barest whisper, but he heard her.</p><p>Fingers on her jaw, another gossamer kiss, his body so big and hot. \u201cHold on.\u201d With that, he reached down and swung her up into his arms, carrying her to the bedroom ... and to the bed made up with soft white linen on which some romantic soul had scattered rose petals. They were velvet bites against her back when he placed her on the bed, the faint light spilling in from the balcony the only illumination.</p> <p>They were wolves. It was all they needed.</p><p>\u201cWe should turn down the bed,\u201d she said, her eyes on him as he reached back to strip off his T-shirt, baring a body she craved even more today than the first time they\u2019d shared the most intimate skin privileges.</p><p>\u201cNo sheets,\u201d he said, kicking off his shoes and reaching down to tug off his socks with curt male efficiency. \u201cI want to see you.\u201d He came around to get rid of her boots and socks as quickly, before prowling up over her, his hair falling across his forehead. \u201cYou are so beautiful.\u201d He sounded almost ... surprised, as if he was seeing her for the first time.</p><p>Perhaps he was, because she didn\u2019t quite know this lover either. The one who touched her with sensual fascination and wanted to discover her every secret pleasure point. \u201cRiaz,\u201d she whispered when he kissed his way down her navel, having tugged off her jeans and panties to discard them over the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d A wet kiss pressed just above her pubic bone, his hands pushing her thighs apart, the roughness of his skin a shock that made her quiver.</p><p>It was the most intimate of kisses, his patience exquisite. Her soft cries lingered in the air, shimmered on the fine layer of perspiration that turned her skin into a mirage. And still he petted her with a slow attention to detail that made it crystal clear that while she was the one who trembled and broke, this was very much his pleasure, too.</p><p>His fantasy.</p><p>The realization was more intoxicating than any wine. Surrendering to the sensations, she was still gasping for breath when he finally made his way up her body to nip at her throat hard enough to leave a mark. All the while, he petted her breasts, her abdomen, the tops of her thighs with hands both proprietary and demanding enough that she knew his control wasn\u2019t as impeccable as it appeared.</p> <p>She opened her mouth to his kiss, her legs to the jean-clad thigh he pushed in between. But he withdrew it after only a second, muttering, \u201cSkin,\u201d before rolling away and stripping off his clothing to return to her, a big, dangerous predator who had decided to pet her to pleasure such as she\u2019d never before felt.</p><p>This time, he settled himself over her, his erection pushing aggressively against her abdomen. He allowed her to close her fingers around the heated steel of him, the skin that sheathed him paradoxically soft. She wanted to taste him, please him as he\u2019d done her, but tonight, she was his to do with as he wished. It wasn\u2019t in the nature of a dominant female to give in so utterly in bed, but Adria hadn\u2019t ever felt so treasured by a lover. It threatened to make her afraid, but she refused to submit to the insidious emotion, refused to taint a night she knew would become a memory she\u2019d cherish.</p><p>His mouth at her breasts, licking and tasting. His hand between her legs. His fingers sliding deep into her, his way eased by the molten heat of her need. She squeezed, attempted to hold him, but he withdrew ... and then he was nudging her thighs apart and pushing into her with the thick intrusion of his cock.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d he whispered once more, sliding one hand under her head to fist it in her hair, stroking her leg up over his hip with the other.</p><p>She could do nothing else, her body his instrument. Rocking home with a grunt, he claimed another kiss, this one hotter, more demanding, but continuing to hold that lazy edge that said he had all night to love her. And when he began to move, it was with the same languorous rhythm, their bodies locked in a slow dance that seared pleasure through to her toes.</p><p>Seduced ... she was being seduced.</p><p>Chapter 41</p><p>HAWKE LOOKED ACROSS the cabin to where his mate sat curled up in bed with a datapad. She was reading a paper her lecturer had recommended, while he had Kenji and Riaz\u2019s joint report on the BlackSea negotiations. He\u2019d rather have been in bed beside Sienna, but she\u2019d barred him from it. \u201cWe won\u2019t get any work done otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Sprawled in the armchair he\u2019d added to the cabin a couple of weeks ago, he tried to figure out why he was so damn happy when by rights, he should\u2019ve been feeling a little surly.</p><p>Because she\u2019s here. My mate is here with me, safe, doing something utterly ordinary.</p><p>It was a gift he couldn\u2019t have anticipated a few months ago, and one he\u2019d let no one tarnish with fear.</p><p>Sienna looked up at that instant. \u201cYou\u2019re not working.\u201d Touching her finger to the screen of her datapad, she primly turned a page.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve been on the same page for ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrat.\u201d Laughing, she put the datapad on the comforter and threw her arms apart. \u201cAs Ben would say, \u2018Hi! Want to play?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Always. \u201cNot outside.\u201d It was raining, and while his wolf could function fine through snow and sleet itself, both parts of him liked being warm and dry.</p><p>\u201cSome tough guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here and say that.\u201d Putting down the report, he crooked a finger.</p><p>Instead of obeying, Sienna gave him a secretive, slightly guilty look. He\u2019d seen that same look more times than he could count while she\u2019d been a juvenile. Tempted to pounce on her, he said, \u201cDo I want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to make cookies.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cIs that what they\u2019re calling it now?\u201d</p><p>She threw a pillow at him. \u201cI brought the ingredients in my backpack. So, can we?\u201d</p><p>Lobbing it back, he cocked his head. \u201cWe have the night to ourselves\u201d\u2014a mission to accomplish even with the current relative peace\u2014\u201cand you want to make cookies?\u201d</p><p>She was suddenly very interested in the pillow. \u201cLara does it and it looks fun. Marlee and Toby like it.\u201d She picked at the stitching of the pillowcase. \u201cI\u2019d like to know how ... for the future.\u201d</p><p>In case we have children one day.</p><p>She could\u2019ve asked Lara, Evie, Tarah, but she\u2019d waited to ask him. It made him her slave all over again. \u201cAnother memory for your box?\u201d</p><p>Her smile was the sun coming out of the clouds. \u201cI have chocolate chips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I guess\u201d\u2014getting up, he held out a hand\u2014\u201cwe\u2019re making cookies.\u201d</p><p>Determined to succeed, they pulled up recipes on the Internet, watched demonstration videos, and substituted cranberries for raisins, because neither one of them was a fan of \u201cshriveled grapes.\u201d</p><p>The best thing that could be said about their maiden effort was that it was edible\u2014and that Sienna had melted chocolate on the tip of her nose he had to lick off.</p><p>They managed to burn the second batch\u2014in a no-burn oven.</p><p>The third batch, however ... \u201cThese are mine.\u201d He made an imaginary line down the tray that put ninety percent of the cookies on his side.</p><p>Throwing her arms around his neck, Sienna kissed him, smiling all the while. \u201cFine,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll give you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying my kiss only rates a two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could be persuaded to reconsider.\u201d</p><p>Later, after he\u2019d fed her warm cookies while she promised him all sorts of favors, they drank milk and brushed their teeth to make up for the sugar currently swimming through their bloodstreams, and got into bed facing one another. Rain continued to pound on the roof, a transient shield around their own private world that made the cabin seem even more snug. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI had fun.\u201d It was a sighing comment from his mate.</p><p>Running a fingertip around the shell of her ear, he said, \u201cI think we should try muffins next.

He\u2019d made cookies with his mom long ago, had lost the memory under the weight of the pain that had come later, but it was once again a radiant jewel in his mind.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking marble cake,\u201d Sienna said, expression sparkling with excitement.</p> <p>He whistled. \u201cAmbitious.\u201d</p><p>Rubbing her nose against his, she whispered, \u201cNo one will ever know if we end up with a vaguely mud-colored cake instead.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, grabbing her and turning onto his back so that she ended up lying along his body. \u201cLook at us, we\u2019re talking about something so domestic.\u201d No guns.

She\u2019d spent the night tangled around a sexy, gorgeous man who\u2019d laughed with her in the midnight hours, his voice a delicious rasp over her skin, and who\u2019d made love to her again sometime before morning. He\u2019d been more demanding the second time, but no less tender. She was feeling terribly petted and spoiled.</p><p>When she poked her head up from the sheets to see him walking into the room dressed in nothing but a towel hitched around his hips, a cup of coffee in hand, she simply stopped breathing for a second. \u201cCome here,\u201d she murmured once she could speak again. He smelled of soap and man and coffee, and she wanted only to rub her face against his chest, indulge the deep sensory need he both created and filled in her.</p><p>Taking a seat on the bed, he put the coffee on the little side table with pretty curved legs. Her eyes locked on a droplet of water making its way down his chest, the dusky hue of his skin broken by a sprinkling of dark hair. \u201cYou missed a drop,\u201d she said, catching it on her finger.</p><p>No laughter, his expression reserved.</p><p>Fingers curling into her palm, she allowed her hand to fall to the sheet. \u201cThis changes things, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d She\u2019d known the night had been too beautiful not to, had been trying to ignore the inevitable truth, because this feeling inside of her, it was a fizzy joy she hadn\u2019t felt for so long it wasn\u2019t even a memory.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A single rough word, but his hand, it closed over her own, warm and protective.</p> <p>She spread her fingers, interlocked them with his own. \u201cDo you want to end it?\u201d The fact it hurt her deep inside to ask that question was an unmistakable sign she\u2019d already started to fall for this man who could never give her what she needed.</p><p>\u201cWe should stop,\u201d Riaz said, eyes of pale brown shot with amber in the morning sunlight, \u201cbefore it costs us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Yet neither one of them made the move to break their physical connection. Adria\u2019s wolf stood in silence, uncertain ... scared. It was hard to admit that, to accept that in spite of her every promise to herself, Riaz had come perilously close to breaching the core she\u2019d vowed to protect. Part of her wanted to wrench her hand from his, turn away. It would be the safer choice, allowing her to walk out of this a little bruised but heart-whole. And still...</p><p>Riaz cupped the side of her face with his free hand. \u201cI\u2019m a bad risk, Adria.\u201d Raw, his soul stripped bare. \u201cA really bad one.\u201d</p><p>Untangling their fingers, she pushed up into a kneeling position, the sheet held to her breasts. \u201cI\u2019m worse.\u201d The scars she carried were invisible, and marked her to the bone. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to trust a man with all of me ever again.\u201d His honesty deserved her own. \u201cI\u2019m broken deep inside.\u201d</p><p>Almost able to taste the intensity of her pain, Riaz curved his hand over her nape. \u201cI swear to God, I will hunt Martin down and rip him limb from limb.\u201d A dominant female\u2019s pride, her self-belief was her armor, something no male worth his salt would ever attempt to strip from her.</p><p>Startled laughter coloring the air, Adria tugged him down until their foreheads touched. \u201cThere\u2019s no need. It took me longer than it should have, but I saw him for what he was\u2014and I saw the mistakes I\u2019d made, too.\u201d</p> <p>But the damage done, he thought, was nothing that would easily fade, her scars as indelible as his own. As indelible as the feminine strength that had brought her out of the darkness. His wolf, its teeth still bared, took a single step toward her, halted. He felt as if he stood on the edge of a treacherous cliff. A single wrong move could send him tumbling down into a rocky gorge, shattering his bones, his mind, his soul itself.</p><p>He\u2019d never expected to be here, facing this moment, with any woman.</p><p>A storm cloud deep within, the shadow of a past he was determined to lay to rest threatening to darken the morning, but as strong was the knowledge that he couldn\u2019t live in limbo forever without going mad, and that the flickering flame between him and Adria was something important, something worth fighting for.</p><p>Maybe, just maybe, two broken people could manage to create something whole. \u201cYes,\u201d he said and waited, his wolf\u2019s body quivering with a tension that kicked him in the guts with exactly how important Adria had become to him. And, his eyes on the mark he\u2019d sucked on her neck, he knew he wasn\u2019t going to behave and walk away if she said no.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her answer made his wolf lunge to the fore. He didn\u2019t fight the shift, because this decision, it was as much the wolf\u2019s as it was the man\u2019s. A lovely woman with wide violet eyes and hair of tumbled silk was kneeling beside him when he completed the shift to pad around and take a seat on the sheets, his body pressing against her knees. An instant later, the air filled with iridescent sparks of color ... to form into the shape of an elegant silver wolf with an unexpected white flash on her tail.</p><p>Shaking herself as if to settle her new skin, she lay down next to him, her muzzle on her front paws, her body half the size of his in this form. He shifted to crowd her against the headboard. Snarling, she pricked him with her claws when he pushed too much. He nipped at her ear.</p><p>Amber eyes turned to him in a warning that had his wolf nuzzling at her with wild affection that came from the heart of the predator. She wasn\u2019t the one who had made its soul sing in recognition when they had been in this waterlogged city before, but she was his friend, his lover, carried his scent. The wolf trusted her at his back, with its secrets, had no intention of letting her go.</p><p>IT was late at night, well past a seven-and-a-half-year-old\u2019s bedtime when Judd sat down next to William on a fallen log in the wooded area behind the home the boy\u2019s family had bought on the borderline of DarkRiver and SnowDancer territory. There was no longer any need for Judd to hide his presence, his cover well and truly blown, but he made sure his visits to see William stayed covert nonetheless\u2014the instant the vulnerable boy was associated with him, he\u2019d become a target. There were those, Psy or not, who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to take William, mold him into a tool of death.</p><p>Like Judd, the boy was a Tk-Cell. He could literally move cells within the body itself\u2014which meant he could stop a heart and make it look like a natural death. Judd had had to teach William that ugly truth not only because the boy had already inadvertently killed a family pet, but also because William needed to realize and acknowledge every aspect of his ability so that he could gain control over it. However, they were taking the practical application of William\u2019s Tk-Cell strength in a wholly new direction.</p><p>Now, reaching over, he ruffled the boy\u2019s soft brown hair. \u201cBad haircut.\u201d It was as if someone had put a bowl on top of his head and sheared around it. Crookedly.</p><p>William propped his elbows on his knees, cupping his face. \u201cMom.\u201d Pure exasperation. \u201cShe says it\u2019ll grow out, but I have to go to school!\u201d</p><p>With enough time and effort, William could learn to morph the cells of his own body\u2014but the skill was a difficult and enervating one even for Judd, and he was much stronger than William. \u201cTell everyone you did it on a dare,\u201d he said, opting for a much more accessible and effective solution.</p><p>A grin. \u201cThat\u2019s smart.\u201d His eyes went to the inside pocket of Judd\u2019s leather-synth jacket, revealed by the way Judd had braced his forearms on his thighs. \u201cI like chocolate.\u201d</p><p>Judd pulled out the bar he\u2019d picked up en route. \u201cIt\u2019s yours if you can demonstrate your proficiency with the technique I taught you last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Some would say the boy was too young for such things, but those people didn\u2019t understand how a psychic loss of control could devastate. The accidental death of his pet had almost destroyed William. What would happen if he stopped his mother\u2019s heart or gave his father a stroke?</p><p>No. Better that Judd be a harsh taskmaster\u2014though he had no intention of treating the boy as brutally as he\u2019d been treated as a child, until he\u2019d broken and been re-formed into an assassin. Hence the candy bar for a reward, as recommended by Ben, his personal consultant when it came to all things concerning small children.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d William said, jumping off the log. \u201cI\u2019ve been practicing.\u201d</p><p>Putting the chocolate bar back in his pocket, Judd took out a small pocketknife. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>William rubbed his hands down the front of his jeans, took a deep breath and said, \u201cYes. Go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to monitor you telepathically.\u201d The only time he would ever invade the boy\u2019s mind without asking was if William lost fatal control\u2014and William had made that request himself.</p><p>\u201cSo you can see if I\u2019m following the correct process,\u201d William said, his tone a perfect imitation of Judd\u2019s when he\u2019d spoken those words.</p><p>It made his chest grow warm, the smile building from within. \u201cYes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHere they go.\u201d William dropped his shields, but he was never vulnerable to an attack\u2014Judd had already taken over the task.</p><p>\u201cOne, two, three.\u201d He slicked the blade of the knife across his palm.</p><p>Blood welled, thick and red.</p> <p>Chapter 42</p><p>IT LOOKED IMPRESSIVE, but he\u2019d made the cut shallow\u2014this was about building William\u2019s confidence in his abilities. It didn\u2019t take long before he felt his skin begin to tingle, then tug. In front of him, William\u2019s forehead was scrunched up, his eyes glued to the cut until Judd wasn\u2019t sure the boy was even blinking. Sweat trickled down one temple, his small fists clenched so tight the light tan of his skin was bloodless.</p><p>Five minutes of fierce concentration later, William said, \u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d and swayed on his feet.</p><p>\u201cSit. Drink.\u201d He gave the boy the liter bottle of nutrient-rich sports water he\u2019d placed by his foot. Only when William was steadier did he take a tissue from his pocket to wipe away the blood and reveal the faint pink line of a scar that looked two days old. \u201cVery good.\u201d He passed over the chocolate bar.</p><p>William tore off the wrapper to take a big bite. \u201cIt makes me really hungry,\u201d he said after he\u2019d swallowed. \u201cAnd tired.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re using your psychic muscles. You need to remember to refuel and rest.\u201d Young, his body developing, William\u2019s psychic reserves were low. That didn\u2019t negate his power. \u201cYou did an excellent job.\u201d</p><p>When William beamed and leaned into him, Judd felt another one of those cracks form inside him. The ones the people he loved kept making, showing him he had the capability to feel even more than he believed.</p><p>William finished the chocolate bar and looked up. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready for the other stuff.\u201d</p><p>The \u201cother stuff\u201d was where Judd took the boy through his entire method, teaching him where he could be more efficient, stronger, or more careful. \u201cClose your eyes and focus.\u201d Dropping his inner shields just enough to allow William to slide into a specific part of his mind, Judd showed the boy the psychic pathway he\u2019d taken, asked him to critique his own performance.</p><p>William was smart and motivated\u2014an excellent student.</p><p>Well done, he said after the boy figured out the solution to a niggling problem. That\u2019s enough for today. Disengage, shields up.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to Venice,\u201d he said when William opened his eyes. \u201cDo you know where that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I know it has water, lots of it. And funny boats.\u201d A pause. \u201cIs that why I had to take a nap this afternoon and meet you so late? Because you\u2019ll be gone tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Judd said, because he didn\u2019t lie to children. \u201cYou\u2019re important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, too.\u201d William\u2019s hug was fierce.</p><p>Judd hugged him back before escorting the boy to the edge of his parents\u2019 property, where his mother and father sat waiting at a wooden picnic table. William ran to them, bursting to share his success. Only when the small family was safe inside the house did Judd turn and walk back into the woods ... and to the men who awaited him. \u201cAden,\u201d he said, finding the Arrow seated on the same log he and William had used. \u201cVasic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t think you\u2019d spot him,\u201d Aden said as Vasic shifted out of the viscous shadows between the trees.</p><p>Judd took a seat beside Aden. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about tracking from changelings.\u201d He\u2019d sensed Vasic\u2019s presence because of the silence the teleporter had created in the tiny denizens of the forest.</p><p>It was Aden who next spoke, his gaze focused in the direction of the house. \u201cThe boy\u2019s one of us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Vasic\u2019s next words were quiet. \u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye on him while you\u2019re in Venice.\u201d</p><p>Judd had expected nothing less. If there was one thing that held true for every Arrow he\u2019d ever known\u2014except Ming LeBon, and he\u2019d never truly been one of them\u2014it was that they were loyal. Sometimes that loyalty was misdirected, given to those who did not deserve it, but it was never false, and never for sale. \u201cDid you track me down for a reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe always have a reason, Judd.\u201d Aden picked up an acorn, examined it with care. \u201cDo you know about the others? In Venice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d never heard a hint about other rogue Arrows.</p><p>\u201cGood. That means we succeeded.\u201d The Arrow medic placed the acorn back on the ground.</p><p>\u201cSize of the group?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA small percentage of those who officially died during missions over the past decade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d All Arrow bodies were retrieved, death confirmed by a pathologist who wasn\u2019t part of the squad.</p><p>\u201cFirst the squad liberated certain corpses from mortuaries after they\u2019d been processed for burial. Of the right size and height to fit an Arrow about to defect. Then the corpses were substituted in place of the Arrows in planned incidents where the bodies would be so damaged, the DNA so degraded, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to fool the scans. Explosions and fires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisky.\u201d The whole thing would\u2019ve unraveled if a conscientious scientist decided to double-check his findings before the \u201cArrow\u201d body was cremated.</p><p>\u201cYes, but possible with the previous generation of DNA scanners,\u201d Aden said, giving Judd another indication of the long-term nature of the plan. \u201cThe same procedure wouldn\u2019t work now. That\u2019s why we currently channel the majority of defectors through a facility in the Dinarides.\u201d</p><p>The Ghost, Judd recalled, had mentioned the Dinarides facility in connection with Arrows who had been taken off Jax.</p><p>Vasic spoke on the heels of that thought. \u201cMing told Aden to wean the Arrows at Dinarides off Jax to see if they could be restabilized\u2014and a few weeks later, he told his medical staff to ensure none of them ever made it out alive.\u201d</p><p>Because Ming LeBon only wanted perfect soldiers. Fractures that couldn\u2019t be mended or that might leave a vulnerability made a man useless to him.</p><p>\u201cHe staffed the place with non-Arrows as a check on me,\u201d Aden added, \u201cbut he forgot I\u2019m not just a field medic.\u201d</p><p>Judd wondered if Aden had used the telepathic skills he\u2019d learned from Walker to subtly influence the minds of the medical staff who may as well have been lambs led to slaughter. \u201cNo reason then for Ming to question the eventual death certificates that came out of the facility.\u201d</p><p>Aden\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change as he said, \u201cEspecially when their bodies had already been cremated, the cremations verified by Keisha Bale herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe head M-Psy,\u201d Vasic said when Judd glanced up in question.</p><p>\u201cDo I know the renegades?\u201d Judd asked, impressed by the scale of the deception.</p><p>\u201cThe first four defections occurred in the generation before ours\u2014the initial two remained heavily shielded in the Net for almost two years after their \u2018deaths,\u2019 until a third defection could be successfully navigated,\u201d Aden said. \u201cThree is the smallest group they wanted to chance in terms of a stand-alone network.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA smart decision.\u201d The LaurenNet had initially had two adults, one teenager, and two children, and it had taken everything they had to maintain the fabric of the psychic network.</p><p>\u201cAfter the third defection, followed quickly by a fourth, the program went into hibernation to ease any suspicion. It was reinitialized when I took over the field medic position.\u201d</p><p>That was when Judd made the connection. \u201cYour parents both died after the small stealth boat they were on exploded while at sea.\u201d Aden had been a boy ... but old enough to have become Silent, old enough to have learned to protect the secrets inside his mind.</p><p>The other man didn\u2019t confirm his supposition, but neither did he deny it. \u201cI watched you after you got yourself taken off Jax,\u201d Aden said instead, \u201cconsidered bringing you in, but you were such a perfect Arrow. I could find no way to prove that the Jax hadn\u2019t already done what it was intended to do, that you weren\u2019t one of Ming\u2019s reprogrammed puppets.\u201d</p><p>Ironic, Judd thought, that he\u2019d done such a good job of hiding his intentions even his fellow Arrows had never suspected him of seditious leanings. \u201cKrychek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than Ming,\u201d was the short answer. \u201cAs for the rest ... We will make decisions that benefit the squad and the Net. That is the single operative factor.\u201d</p><p>Never before, Judd thought, had the Arrows threatened to break so completely from the ruling powers of the PsyNet. For now, Aden and the others followed Kaleb Krychek, but only until he betrayed them. That had been Ming\u2019s fatal mistake. \u201cDo you intend to eliminate Ming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility.\u201d Aden stared out into the forest. \u201cThe Net is already destabilizing. A number of the squad believe the impact of his death won\u2019t be as significant when the overall fabric is rippling, but I\u2019m of the opinion it could be the tipping point that leads to a deadly rupture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Judd said, having had an update from the Ghost as to the current situation. \u201cThe Council might be fractured, but the majority of the populace doesn\u2019t believe that yet.\u201d Though the rumors were going viral. \u201cMing\u2019s death would be a profound psychic shock.\u201d</p><p>Aden gave a small nod. \u201cThe squad will follow my lead on this, and I\u2019ve said we wait. He\u2019ll die when he needs to die.\u201d</p><p>Judd knew it wasn\u2019t false confidence. He also knew Aden understood exactly how vicious an adversary Ming would be\u2014his assassination would take careful planning, a precision strike. A single hint of warning, and Ming would turn it into a bloody showdown.</p><p>Vasic shifted a fraction, the leaves rustling around his boots. \u201cThe Arrows in Venice\u2014they\u2019d like to speak to you, but it can\u2019t be in public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour face is too well known now,\u201d Aden said. \u201cThey can\u2019t risk anything that could compromise their cover.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Judd had no argument with that, understood why the Arrows needed to maintain this secret. \u201cDo you have images of a private location?\u201d He needed it for a teleport lock.</p><p>Aden pulled out a small phone, handed it over. \u201cPhotos loaded. Call the preset number when you arrive and one of them will come out to meet you. Connection is secure, can\u2019t be traced, even if hacked.\u201d</p><p>Taking it, Judd considered how many more of these defector cells there might be across the world, martial and familial. \u201cYou\u2019ve laid the groundwork for a total defection from the Net.\u201d Houses, finances, alternate lives, the defectors had had years to put everything in place.</p><p>Aden took time to reply. \u201cIt\u2019s an option, but only if there is no other. The squad has no wish to abandon the Net, but neither will we stand by and watch those in power use us up then discard us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome of us are tired, Judd,\u201d Vasic added quietly, the gray of his eyes holding the darkest of shadows. \u201cWhen this is all over, all we ask for is peace.\u201d</p><p>When this is all over...</p><p>Judd wondered if anything or anyone would survive when the civil war in the PsyNet began in earnest, whether Vasic would ever find his peace ... or go to his death an Arrow to the last.</p><p>\u201cDO we need to see Bowen today?\u201d Adria said to Riaz as they finished breakfast on the balcony, wanting to suggest they spend their time walking around the city. A little space might ease the strange, painful tension that both connected and distanced them.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cUntil Judd gets here to test the neural chips, there\u2019s not much we can do.\u201d His phone beeped at that instant, the number on the screen making him grin as he answered. \u201cThe deal done?\u201d A pause, then, \u201cYeah, fine.\u201d His grin widened at whatever the person on the other end had said, before he spoke again. \u201cWhere? Right.\u201d</p> <p>Hanging up without good-bye, he said, \u201cDo you know Pierce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTall, ice green eyes, could be Italian, Indian, Eastern European, a combination of all of the above or none at all?\u201d The man she was thinking of had visited with Matthias a couple of years back, having driven his mom and nephew over to see a show. \u201cSenior soldier out of Alexei\u2019s sector?\u201d</p><p>Riaz grinned at her description. \u201cThat\u2019s him. He\u2019s tied up the deal he was working on and is headed in to see us. I assumed you\u2019d be okay meeting up with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Even a lone wolf, she thought, needed contact with members of his pack, and if Pierce had taken over Riaz\u2019s duties, he\u2019d been on his own for months.</p><p>\u201cAs for his heritage,\u201d Riaz told her, eyes gleaming, \u201cPierce told me he comes from a line of globe-trotting marauders turned traders who mated \u2018with men and women from every known country and some that no longer exist\u2019 over the centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood story.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFrom his track record, women obviously think so.\u201d</p><p>Pierce had apparently already been on a water bus when he\u2019d called and it was only fifteen minutes later that they caught up with the other man in the lobby of their hotel. Adria\u2019s wolf chuckled at glimpsing the sidelong glances of passing women\u2014and more than a few men\u2014who couldn\u2019t take their eyes off Riaz and Pierce. One woman almost walked into a column. Adria sympathized. Separately they were both sexy, dangerous men with dark hair and bodies that could make a woman whimper. Together, they were lethal.</p><p>Oblivious to the attention, the two men embraced in a typically male way, complete with slaps on the back and punches on the shoulders.</p><p>\u201cYou still fucking owe me a hundred bucks,\u201d was Pierce\u2019s opening greeting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you an ice cream.\u201d</p><p>The exchange made Adria\u2019s wolf grin, because it was clear the two were close enough friends that they didn\u2019t bother to be polite. When Pierce turned to her, his crystal clear eyes narrowed for a second. \u201cMatthias\u2019s sector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent memory.\u201d Introducing herself, she took a backseat to the conversation as they headed out to explore, the men\u2019s quiet, deep voices a welcome accompaniment to her absorption in Venice.</p><p>Walking into a glass-smith\u2019s forge on the neighboring island of Murano, she lost herself in the colors and shapes created from the fire, while Riaz and Pierce prowled alongside her with lazy patience. The pieces created in that small workshop and the ones that followed were beyond beautiful, fragile dreams born of silica and painstaking craftsmanship. She stroked her hand over a flowing sculpture that sighed with sensuality, laughed in delight at the tiny glass birds perched on an indoor tree, was beguiled by the miniature chandeliers.</p> <p>In the end, she bought a trio of birds with bright cobalt plumage. \u201cFor Tarah, Indigo, and Evie, plus this gorgeous necklace for my mom,\u201d she said to Riaz when he walked over from another corner of the artisan\u2019s store, showing him the lustrous beads of orange swirled with gold. \u201cAnd these for me.\u201d She held up a pair of miniature hummingbirds, the earrings jewel green with a dash of scarlet.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want those?\u201d A solemn question. \u201cYou\u2019ve only been in half the stores on the island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d she said, \u201cmake fun of the new traveler.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her on the cheek instead, the warmth of his body a caress she\u2019d missed. \u201cI like seeing Venice through your eyes.\u201d</p><p>A tiny bud of hope sprouted in her heart. \u201cThank you for showing me this shop.\u201d It had been hidden, a secret treasure trove. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>He held up two small glass boxes in different colors, tied with glass bows of silver. \u201cI took my mother one last time and she told me she needed a set. And for her highness, Marisol, I\u2019ll be grabbing a big box of candy.\u201d</p><p>It was impossible not to adore a man who made no bones about how much he loved the women in his life. \u201cYour niece is a lucky girl,\u201d she said, rising to drop a kiss to the corner of his mouth. \u201cAnd your mother raised a good man.\u201d</p><p>His arm slid across her waist to settle on her hip. \u201cPierce found something he thinks you\u2019ll like.\u201d Tapping her on the nose, he nodded to the other end of the shop. \u201cI\u2019ll have this wrapped for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d The tiny bud within her grew a single whisper-thin leaf of vivid green: Sex was one thing, but giving and accepting such sweet affection\u2014tender and public and playful\u2014it took their relationship to a haunting new place. A place that might cause her terrible hurt, and yet one she knew she couldn\u2019t walk away from.</p><p>It was too late for that.</p><p>Chapter 43</p><p>CHEST TIGHT WITH the realization, Adria crossed over to Pierce and peered inside the glass case beside which he stood. The sculpture displayed within was frankly bizarre\u2014it looked like someone had smashed up a hunk of puke-colored glass, then put it back together. Badly.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it magnificent?\u201d Pierce touched the case with reverent fingertips.</p><p>Not wanting to hurt his feelings, she scrambled for a response. \u201cI can see it speaks to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. The artistic flow is indescribable.\u201d</p><p>Adria wasn\u2019t sure quite what to say to that, but he was waiting for her to respond with such an expectant expression on his face that she knew she had to speak. \u201cYes, it\u2019s ... ah ... imaginative.\u201d</p><p>Pierce began to talk about the absorbing ambiguity of the shapes and how the power of the piece was a subtle fusion of light and darkness. It was almost two minutes later, just when she was plotting her escape, that she caught the glint in his eye and realized she\u2019d been had. Intense, passionate, and intelligent Pierce was a playful wolf at heart.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes,\u201d she said when he paused, \u201cyou\u2019re so right. In fact, I think it\u2019d be the perfect gift.\u201d Biting the inside of her cheek to keep from bursting out laughing, she took one of his hands in between her own. \u201cI\u2019m going to buy it for you\u2014no, no, I insist. You\u2019ve been so great today, so patient.\u201d</p><p>Distinct alarm. \u201cNo, there\u2019s no need. I already have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI insist.\u201d Turning, she quick-stepped it to where Riaz was standing at the counter, the bag containing her souvenirs in hand. \u201cRiaz, I found the best gift for Pierce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you give me that monstrosity,\u201d Pierce growled from behind her, \u201cI will regift it to you on your birthday.\u201d</p><p>A snort escaped Adria. Pierce\u2019s eyes narrowed. And then she was laughing so hard, she had to walk outside and collapse against the wall. Following her out, Riaz tugged on her braid. \u201cPierce is not amused.\u201d Deep gold, his eyes told her his wolf most definitely was.</p><p>Pierce\u2019s snarl made tears come out of her eyes. \u201cServes you right,\u201d she managed to get out to the glowering male.</p><p>\u201cHey! I was\u2014\u201d An abrupt pause. \u201cI think that\u2019s my cell.\u201d</p><p>Adria hadn\u2019t heard anything, but perhaps he had it on vibrate. As he walked a few steps away to answer the call, she turned to Riaz. \u201cDo we have time to sneak into the glass museum I saw?\u201d</p><p>Riaz wrapped his arm around her shoulders, tucking her close. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Wanting to nuzzle at his throat, she gave in a little and pressed a kiss to the hollow. His response was a teasing snap of his teeth by her ear.</p><p>We\u2019ll be okay.</p><p>The bud greened with health, but deep inside, she knew it would never be so simple.</p><p>TRAVELING under an assumed name, and with his features disguised to avoid attention, Judd stepped off an airjet at Marco Polo Airport late that afternoon, then caught a water bus to Venice. He could\u2019ve teleported in and negated the need for the subterfuge, but there was no point in using up his telekinetic reserves without cause.</p><p>When he reached the island, he found a corner out of sight of passersby\u2014and of security cameras, concentrated on the images Aden had given him, and teleported to the location where he was to meet the rebels. It proved to be a small indoor courtyard, the walls creamy with age and covered with some type of a dark green vine.</p><p>There was no need to make a cell phone call.</p><p>\u201cI was told I was expected,\u201d he said to the armed man who watched him with the flat eyes of an Arrow, though he was dressed in faded denim jeans and a blue T-shirt. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The slightest hesitation, the man\u2019s eyes flicking to his hair. It was currently dirty blond, his eyes a pale gray. \u201cWho sent you?\u201d The other man didn\u2019t lower his weapon.</p><p>Instead of answering, Judd\u2014having built up the correct focus\u2014bent the muzzle of the gun downward, rendering it ineffective. The rebel Arrow threw it aside, hitting Judd with a telepathic blow at the same time ... but Judd had his psychic hands in the cells of the male\u2019s heart. He shifted things enough to pinch a blood vessel.</p><p>The man paled at the warning. \u201cTk-Cell.\u201d It was a gasp, his hand up, palm out.</p> <p>Judd released him, fixing the damage as he left. \u201cI assume no further introductions are necessary.\u201d</p><p>The answer came from behind him, where he\u2019d sensed a familiar presence. \u201cI apologize, Judd,\u201d said the melodic female voice. \u201cAlejandro has orders to incapacitate all unknowns who enter the courtyard.\u201d</p><p>Keeping Alejandro in his line of sight, he turned to see a petite woman in her late twenties with a face that was all soft curves, her lips lush. But it was her eyes that told the truth of her nature\u2014the color of coal, they were like chips of ice. \u201cZaira.\u201d Born in Jordan and raised in an Arrow training facility in Turkey, she\u2019d been lost in action five years ago.</p><p>Zaira\u2019s gaze shifted. A second later, Alejandro gave a sharp nod and left. Only then did Zaira turn and invite him to join her for a walk around the courtyard. \u201cWe did not expect you until this evening. That\u2019s why one of us wasn\u2019t on watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlejandro is damaged.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis neural functions are fine, but he was given an overdose of Jax while on a mission. It\u2019s left him unable to veer from an order. Alejandro no longer understands subtleties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo long as I don\u2019t give him a direct order, he won\u2019t kill.\u201d Zaira paused for a long second before continuing the walk. \u201cI saved his life, and he ... imprinted on me. It concerns me, but according to Aden, there\u2019s nothing to be done. His mental pathways are locked.\u201d</p><p>Judd picked up the nuances of deep emotion, wondered how much of it was truth and how much a mask created to blend into the human world. Arrows did not easily break Silence. He knew that better than anyone. \u201cWhy did you want to see me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve gleaned from the media reports, you appear to have carved out a stable life for yourself and your family. We want to know how you did it.\u201d</p><p>Judd glanced around the courtyard, aware he was being watched by more eyes than Zaira\u2019s. \u201cYou all live here, in this compound?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do for income?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiversified investments made over a number of years, including properties in various cities and localities.\u201d Zaira turned the corner of the courtyard, coming to a stop beside a curved archway. \u201cMoney is not what concerns us.\u201d</p><p>Judd asked one final question before giving the other Arrow the answer she sought. \u201cDo you intermingle with the outside population?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly as much as necessary. The rest of us aren\u2019t like Alejandro, who simply can\u2019t handle the stimulation, but we continue to grapple with being outside Silence.\u201d She looked at him with a directness that would disconcert most non-Psy. \u201cI defected before you, as did a number of the others, but we are nowhere as integrated into the world.\u201d</p><p>Judd thought of the kiss Brenna had given him as he left the den, the hug Marlee had run after him to claim, the punch on the shoulder that had been Drew\u2019s way of saying \u201cstay safe.\u201d \u201cYou have to accept,\u201d he said, \u201cthat you need the humans and the changelings, as they need you.\u201d His race had abilities that had once been greatly respected, not merely feared.</p><p>\u201cIsolating yourself will simply further what they began in the Net.\u201d He\u2019d had a family, had known that Walker, Sienna, Toby, and Marlee all cared if he lived or died, and still he\u2019d been brutally close to the edge. The Arrows who lived here had only each other for family\u2014and most Arrows didn\u2019t understand what a family was, much less how to create one.</p><p>Zaira looked up at a sky gone that hazy blue that preceded sunset. \u201cWe can\u2019t take the chance with any outsiders. Not yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Judd agreed, because their task was to be a hidden escape hatch. \u201cBut change is coming.\u201d</p><p>Zaira\u2019s eyes reflected only the steel will that had made her an assassin without compare. \u201cWe are ready.\u201d</p><p>We are Arrows.</p><p>\u201cCOME on. Judd\u2019ll be here in a couple of minutes,\u201d Adria said, having showered and changed after their day out.</p><p>Riaz, his hair damp from the same shower, followed her out into the corridor, shutting the door behind them. \u201cPierce just sent me a message to say he\u2019s going to get you for that stunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was his own fault,\u201d she said with a laugh, feeling a warm affection for the handsome wolf who was Riaz\u2019s friend.</p><p>Riaz\u2019s response was unexpectedly serious. \u201cShower or not, you carry my scent in your skin.\u201d Watchful eyes. \u201cThat bother you?\u201d</p><p>Adria waited until they were inside the elevator cage to answer, the frothy happiness of the day suddenly a lump in her chest. \u201cThe last time I had a man\u2019s scent in my skin, it nearly destroyed me,\u201d she said, tearing open a barely healed wound.</p><p>Knuckles brushing her cheek, the dark wood and citrus tang of his scent in her every breath. \u201cWe\u2019re not all bastards, Adria.\u201d</p><p>The doors opened, saving her from having to continue the conversation. Not that she didn\u2019t agree with his words. But the memories, they were raw, painful things that clawed and bit and threatened to steal her rational mind without warning ... because it had started out tender with Martin, too.</p><p>Gut churning at the conscious acceptance of a dread that had been a noxious whisper at the back of her mind throughout the day, she almost walked past Judd where he stood against a column in the busy hotel lobby. It was his scent that cued her, that touch of ice that was a cool kiss. \u201cYou make a good blond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenna doesn\u2019t like it,\u201d he said as they headed out into the early evening light, Riaz on her left and Judd on her right. \u201cShe\u2019s already bought the neutralizer to get rid of the color once I\u2019m back home.\u201d</p><p>If Adria had met him on the street, she\u2019d have thought Judd sophisticated and aloof, but there was no missing the love in his tone when he spoke of his mate. \u201cI have to admit,\u201d she murmured, \u201cif I had a choice of you with chocolate brown hair or blond, I\u2019d go with the brown every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChocolate brown?\u201d Riaz muttered. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just go ahead and call him a stud?\u201d</p><p>Adria blinked at the edgy comment, belatedly realizing the lone wolf by her side was irritated by the attention she was paying Judd. She\u2019d never been a woman who got off on making a man jealous, and that hadn\u2019t changed. Which was why she said, \u201cBecause I\u2019m partial to pretty gold eyes.\u201d</p><p>Color streaked his cheekbones. \u201cJudd, you\u2019re not listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListening to what?\u201d The other male shot them a quietly amused look. \u201cWe have a tail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlliance,\u201d Riaz said. \u201cI think it\u2019s more of an escort.\u201d</p><p>Adria had picked up the three men as well. \u201cBo,\u201d she explained to Judd, \u201cis acutely paranoid, but in his shoes, I would be, too.\u201d She explained his abduction, as well as the brainwashing of the comm technician, the suspected fate of the former chairman.</p><p>Judd didn\u2019t sound surprised. \u201cRumor is, Tatiana reached her position on the Council by killing her mentor. I know for a fact that she used psychic coercion to get certain contracts\u2014she\u2019s one of the most dangerous and unscrupulous women in the Net. Bowen is right to be paranoid.\u201d</p><p>Further conversation stopped as they reached the Alliance building and were ushered inside to where a scowling Bo was waiting by the elevators. \u201cWe had all the routes into Venice tagged,\u201d he said, eyes on Judd, \u201cfull surveillance with facial recognition software, and yet you got through.\u201d</p><p>Judd\u2019s response was pragmatic. \u201cThere\u2019s not much you can do to stop someone with my training coming into your city.\u201d</p><p>Expression still dark, Bowen led them down to the same room they\u2019d used yesterday. This time, the water was an invisible, inky blackness beyond the glass\u2014it created the unsettling illusion of being cocooned in nothingness. Hiding her shiver, Adria glanced at the four people who sat waiting for them around the conference table: a slender woman Bo introduced as his sister, Lily, along with three other males ranging in age from midtwenties to early forties.</p><p>\u201cI figured five test subjects,\u201d Bo said to Judd after they\u2019d all settled in, \u201cwould give you enough of a range to cross natural shields off the list.\u201d</p><p>Not necessarily, Judd thought, not given the breadth of the Alliance. If the conglomerate that represented human interests was playing some kind of a high-stakes game, it had enough of a membership that it could have gathered five individuals with the rare type of shield. However, all he said to Bo was, \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>The male nodded.</p><p>The instant he touched Bowen\u2019s mind\u2014or attempted to\u2014he knew without a doubt that what stopped his intrusion was no natural shield. Such shields had always felt like solid walls to his psychic senses, but a wall that could bounce things back, repelling any psychic probe. This was a storm of electricity. His probes got through ... but were destroyed before ever reaching their destination.</p><p>Riveted, he tried the most subtle telepathic tricks he knew, including ones Walker had taught him during his clandestine \u2019ports to his brother when Judd was a half-broken teenager in an Arrow training facility. They failed, all of them. The shield was a masterpiece, powered by the electrical charge of the brain itself, and calibrated to provide maximum protection.</p><p>As with a changeling, the only way to disrupt it without having long-term access to the victim would be to blast in with brute power, which would likely result in severe brain damage. Futile if data extraction was the target. The solitary other option was the surgical removal of the chip. Unless\u2014\u201cIs the chip fused to your brain stem?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 44</p><p>BOWEN GAVE A short nod. \u201cAny attempt to remove it once it\u2019s fully integrated will cause death.\u201d</p><p>Which meant extraction would be as pointless as violent force.</p> <p>Considering other ways to get through the electricity, Judd turned to Lily. She went white, clearly less certain of the efficacy of the shield than Bowen, but nodded when he asked for permission to attempt to breach the shield. Hers, he found, was different from Bowen\u2019s\u2014less \u201cactive\u201d in some ways, the currents smoother, but it was just as efficient in degrading his probes.</p><p>\u201cThe test is complete,\u201d he said, retreating from the mind of the final subject.</p><p>Bowen indicated that it was alright for Lily and the others to leave, but they hesitated. The security chief looked at Judd. \u201cThey want to know if you were able to get in.\u201d</p><p>It was a desire Judd could appreciate. \u201cNo. Infiltration proved impossible.\u201d</p><p>Bowen continued to grin after the doors closed on the four volunteers, lines creasing the pale brown hue of his skin. \u201cDo you have any doubts about the origin of the shield?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s unequivocally mechanical,\u201d Judd said, speaking to Riaz and Adria as well as Bowen. \u201cAn extremely beautiful piece of biocompatible engineering.\u201d His admiration was genuine\u2014as was his concern. \u201cIs it safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done extensive tests.\u201d Despite the confident words, Bowen\u2019s smile faded into a look of grim resolve. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve authorized a general rollout, requests are far outstripping supply, even though we\u2019ve been blunt about the risks. The fact is\u201d\u2014the Alliance security chief\u2019s jet-black eyes locked with Judd\u2019s\u2014\u201ceven if it does blow up our brains in a few months or a few years, we\u2019d still have had that time knowing that no one could come in and take what he or she wanted. Knowing our thoughts were private.\u201d</p><p>Judd understood the need. He\u2019d felt the same helplessness as a child. His entire life had been out of his control, held in the hands of those who wanted only to use him. \u201cFull integration\u2014how long does it take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA year according to the projections,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cAfter that, the chip will, in essence, become part of the brain stem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u201d\u2014Riaz\u2019s tone was quiet, serious\u2014\u201cdeciding to put in one of these is a lifetime commitment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bowen rubbed the top of his head, the stubble rasping against his palm. \u201cWe did the first five two weeks apart. We\u2019re the controls. If something goes wrong with number one within that grace period, number two has a shot to get the chip out, and so on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d be the first to fall.\u201d Adria\u2019s husky voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job to protect my people.\u201d Pushing his chair back from the table, Bowen stood, hands braced on the table. \u201cShare the information with your pack, and with DarkRiver and WindHaven. If you have human packmates who\u2019re prepared to take the risk, the Alliance is willing to let a certain number of them cut into the queue as a gesture of good faith.\u201d</p><p>SIENNA was sitting beside Indigo on the edge of the White Zone, supervising a group of two-year-olds playing in the sandpit while their minders had a coffee break, when the lieutenant said, \u201cYou need to start shadowing different members of the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther soldiers, you mean?\u201d Sienna asked, assuming it was an exercise of some kind.</p><p>But the taller woman shook her head, her long ponytail brushing against the back of the fitted Western-style white shirt with three-quarter sleeves she\u2019d tucked into her low-slung jeans. \u201cOne person from every subgroup in the den, from maternal females to healers, to techs, to mechanics, to domestic operations. Soldiers, you already know. And, it\u2019s not an order,\u201d the lieutenant added, \u201cbut a suggestion.\u201d</p><p>Sienna took time to think through Indigo\u2019s recommendation, understanding the lieutenant meant far more than she\u2019d actually said. \u201cLike Hawke,\u201d she finally murmured, speaking more to herself than Indigo. \u201cHe knows every minute detail of every aspect of the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d One arm hooked easily over the leg she\u2019d drawn up at the knee, her back to a young green pine, Indigo paused to call out encouragement to a couple of little ones who were struggling with their sand pails. \u201cHold on, I better go help before they bury each other.\u201d</p><p>Returning a couple of minutes later, sand on the knees of her jeans and the fading echoes of the wolf\u2019s laughter in her eyes, she settled back into her spot. \u201cTell me the reason why,\u201d she said, as if their conversation had never been interrupted.</p> <p>\u201cSo I can be his sounding board.\u201d The person with whom he could discuss ideas he wasn\u2019t yet ready to take to his lieutenants. \u201cSo I can understand the nuances of the situations he has to handle day in, day out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart girl.\u201d Brushing off her knees, the lieutenant turned to look at her. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the only reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for me, too,\u201d Sienna said slowly, grasping what it was Indigo wanted her to see. \u201cTo make the journey from novice soldier to ... something like a lieutenant\u201d\u2014but not the same, her priority Hawke rather than the pack\u2014\u201cfaster and smoother.\u201d Wolves respected strength, and she had that. But she needed more experience, and crucially, she needed the acceptance of the pack when it came to any change in her place in the hierarchy. \u201cThe more people I shadow, the more connections I make.\u201d</p><p>Indigo\u2019s shoulder brushed her own as the lieutenant nodded. \u201cEvery wolf likes to feel appreciated. Hawke does it instinctively\u2014you\u2019ll have to do it more consciously, but in no way does that devalue the commitment you\u2019d be making to know and understand the beating heart of the pack.\u201d</p><p>Spoken, Sienna thought, like the protector Indigo was. They were stronger, undeniably more lethal, but all dominants considered themselves in service to the vulnerable in the pack\u2014because without those gentler packmates, there would be no one to protect, no reason for them to exist ... no sense of a home colored in affection and warmth. It had taken her years of living with SnowDancer to understand such subtleties. \u201cI think it would be a good idea to start with a dominant maternal female, don\u2019t you?\u201d They wielded as much power as the lieutenants, simply in a different sphere.</p><p>Indigo\u2019s glance held open approval and a pride that made Sienna feel as if she\u2019d been given the most lavish praise. \u201cYes. I think if you ask Lara, she\u2019ll set it up with Ava.\u201d</p><p>The tension Sienna hadn\u2019t been aware of feeling until that moment leaked out of her, her shoulders relaxing. She\u2019d met Ava any number of times. Her son, Ben, was one of Marlee\u2019s friends, though the two had recently fallen out\u2014and neither would say what the problem was. \u201cI will.\u201d Drawing in long breaths of the crisp, clean air, she watched a pup in wolf form help his friend complete a sand castle, patting the sand into place with baby paws. \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m building the foundations for the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mind that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy, sometimes I think I\u2019ll burst.\u201d The depth of her joy scared her on occasion. Never had she imagined she\u2019d have a future, a life, beyond the fury of the X-marker. Now that she did ... \u201cI\u2019m going to build a foundation so strong, so solid, it won\u2019t ever shake, no matter what the future brings.\u201d No one, not even Ming LeBon, was going to stop her living her life.</p><p>RIAZ and Adria joined Judd for the trip back to the den that night. The automated water bus from Venice to the mainland was empty, no chance of being overheard, so they spoke in quiet voices, the wind brisk against their cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDo you think anyone will want to take the risk?\u201d Adria asked, worry and empathy battling for space within her. Sam, strong, loyal, courageous, was both a dominant and human. It would devastate him if he fell victim to a Psy mental violation, the act a savage blow to the heart of his nature. \u201cI can see why they would.\u201d</p><p>Bracing his forearms on his thighs, Riaz said, \u201cI have to admit, I never really considered just how vulnerable humans must feel,\u201d a troubled expression marking the strong lines of his features.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Judd said from her right.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t escaped her notice that the two had sandwiched her between them the entire time they\u2019d been together. Her wolf was irritated, its hackles raised. She wasn\u2019t a pup to be protected, but a senior soldier, well able to get herself out of trouble. \u201cDo you think Hawke will want the information circulated throughout the pack?\u201d she asked, fighting the urge to snarl. It would be like trying to explain trigonometry to someone who\u2019d never seen a math book. The words just would not compute in their testosterone-laden male brains.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Riaz\u2019s answer was decisive, the dark masculinity of his scent twining around her in invisible threads. \u201cNot until Ashaya\u2019s done exhaustive tests to confirm the chip is safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be said\u201d\u2014Judd\u2019s calm voice\u2014\u201cthat the humans in the pack should be given the information and allowed to make up their own minds.\u201d</p><p>Riaz glanced at the Psy male. \u201cYou know a pack doesn\u2019t work like that. It can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Judd echoed Riaz\u2019s position, the wind rifling through the dirty blond of his hair. \u201cHawke is responsible for the health of the pack as a whole, and sometimes that means making hard calls when it comes to individual choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Riaz answered. \u201cIf our human packmates decided to do this, and the chips failed, their deaths would rip the heart right out of SnowDancer. The gain is not worth the risk, not yet.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s statement echoed inside Adria.</p><p>She thought of the risk she was taking, with this passionate, loyal lone wolf who might never fully belong to her, knew she might just be setting herself up for the hardest fall of all. But, as she\u2019d told Riaz, she wasn\u2019t exactly undamaged goods. And ... she didn\u2019t ever want to look back and regret what could\u2019ve been. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Life might hurt, might bruise, might forever scar, but it was for living.</p><p>\u201cIf you think about it,\u201d Judd said as the fierce thought passed through her mind, \u201cthe PsyNet is structured more like a pack than anything else, with the Council in place of an alpha.\u201d</p><p>Adria shook her head, her wolf rejecting the idea. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference\u2014Hawke\u2019s every decision, whether or not it\u2019s democratic, is for the good of the pack, while the Councilors have a way of using up their people until there\u2019s nothing left.\u201d It angered her to the core that it was the ones who were meant to protect, who were doing the most harm.</p> <p>\u201cThis generation, yes.\u201d Judd\u2019s agreement was solemn. \u201cBut Councils pre-Silence were focused on the strength and health of the race as a whole. Ironically, it\u2019s that desire that led to Silence, but I think the seeds of hope are there, buried in the darkness.\u201d</p><p>As Riaz responded to Judd, the low rumble of his voice raising the hairs on her arms, she found herself thinking that Riaz was, in many ways, more similar to Judd than he was to another wolf. It would take him time to trust a woman enough to fully open up to her, but once he did, he would be devoted.</p><p>Adria didn\u2019t expect such devotion ... wasn\u2019t sure she could handle it if it happened, her wolf panicked at the idea of the possessiveness that would be part and parcel of that kind of love. It made her wonder how Brenna handled it with Judd\u2014the other woman wasn\u2019t a dominant, and had been terribly wounded when she and Judd had first gotten together.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the only thing she wondered. \u201cDo you ever regret being mated?\u201d she asked Judd after they\u2019d made their way from the water bus to the airport and grabbed seats in the gate lounge. Even as she spoke, her eyes followed Riaz\u2019s muscled form as he walked over to the coffee stand to grab them drinks, his hair glinting with hidden highlights of copper and bronze.</p><p>Judd gave her an unreadable glance. \u201cAn unusual question from a wolf.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easier,\u201d she clarified, \u201cto do the work that you do, to walk into danger, if you didn\u2019t have a mate whose heart would break if you were hurt?\u201d</p><p>Judd took his time answering, his gaze on the wide concourse and the people walking and running to catch their airjets. \u201cIt would be more ... convenient,\u201d he said at last. \u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t be easier\u2014Silence is based on the precept that emotion is a weakness, but what I feel for Brenna makes me stronger. I fight harder, dirtier, and rougher, because I know any injury to me will rebound on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a serious discussion,\u201d Riaz said, handing Judd the bottle of water he\u2019d requested, before passing over Adria\u2019s hot chocolate. \u201cWith marshmallows.\u201d A smile that creased his cheeks, made his eyes flicker gold, wild and compelling.</p><p>Her wolf awakened at the sight of his own, the happy memories of lying beside him on the bed in their hotel room making it rub up against her skin in primal affection. It was all she could do not to nuzzle her face into his neck. \u201cI can tell you\u2019re drinking your usual sludge.\u201d The scent of his coffee was rich, potent.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll put hair on my chest.\u201d Lips still curved, he settled into his seat, draping his arm along the back of hers. \u201cSo\u201d\u2014his thigh pressing against her own as he pushed into her space in a very male way\u2014\u201cwhat are you two discussing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether emotion makes us stronger or weaker,\u201d Adria said before Judd could mention mating, her heart twisting at the idea of stealing the smile from Riaz\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p> <p>Taking a gulp of his no-doubt scalding coffee, Riaz said, \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s what makes us human in the wider sense. Without it, we might as well be machines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegardless of their problems,\u201d Judd disagreed at once, \u201cthe Psy in the Net aren\u2019t inhuman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause in some deep part of themselves,\u201d Riaz argued, \u201cthey do feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d It was an unexpected response from a man Adria guessed had gone through the most stringent conditioning in the Net. \u201cSilence was never as watertight as the Council\u2019s propaganda machine would\u2019ve led us to believe.\u201d He nodded toward a mother and child walking down the concourse, the child\u2019s hand held tightly in the adult\u2019s.</p><p>It was clear by the cool lack of expression on their faces, the subtle stiffness of the woman\u2019s walk, that they were Psy. \u201cA Councilor would say she holds the girl\u2019s hand because it\u2019s a practical method to ensure her genetic legacy is not lost or harmed.\u201d</p><p>At that very second, Adria saw the woman shift to block a suitcase from banging into the child, taking the bump herself. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s even what she believes,\u201d Adria murmured, \u201cbut there\u2019s more there.\u201d A protectiveness that had the woman tucking the child closer to her body, her hand cupping the back of the small blonde head.</p><p>\u201cNot for all Psy.\u201d Judd stared at a luggage cart about to roll away from an elderly woman, and it came to a gentle, seemingly natural stop. \u201cIt\u2019s too late for some, the damage done by the conditioning too deep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAirjet Express BD21 to San Francisco now boarding.\u201d</p> <p>Finishing off her hot chocolate, Adria gathered up the rest of their garbage and took it to the recycle slot. Riaz and Judd were up and waiting for her when she returned, with Riaz having slung her duffel over his shoulder, along with his own. She had no problem with that. But when the two of them went to fall in on either side of her, she halted. \u201cI do not need bodyguards.\u201d</p><p>A confused look from both.</p><p>Her wolf flashed its canines. \u201cI knew it wouldn\u2019t compute.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 45</p><p>RIAZ SEPARATED FROM Adria when they reached the den late afternoon San Francisco time. Showering, he pulled on his most well-worn jeans, the fabric soft from repeated washing, and a T-shirt, then made his way to her door. Her scent was damp and warm when she opened it, her hair sleek and shiny from her own shower, her body covered in soft gray pajama pants and a faded purple tee bearing the picture of a depressed cartoon donkey.</p><p>A raised eyebrow. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>His wolf narrowed its eyes at her continued irritability. Neither he nor Judd had been able to figure out what had put her back up before they boarded the airjet. He\u2019d let her stew in silence during the trip, but now stepped into her space and nipped sharply at her lower lip. \u201cWhy are you acting snippy?\u201d He kicked the door shut with his foot.</p><p>Glaring at him, she rubbed at the lip he\u2019d bitten. \u201cI just am. Get over it.\u201d She walked over to flop down on her back on the bed. \u201cAnd go away so I can sulk in peace.\u201d</p><p>He fought his smile. Letting it out would be suicidal with a dominant female in this mood. \u201cI have something for you.\u201d He held up the small bag he\u2019d carried over.</p><p>A startled light in the brilliant hue of her eyes. \u201cYou got me a present?\u201d She scrambled up onto her knees, holding out her hands. \u201cGive!\u201d</p><p>He walked across to sit on the bed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should give it to someone so bad tempered.\u201d Playful as a pup, his wolf grinned.</p><p>Bracing her hands on his shoulders from behind, she closed her teeth gently over the tip of his ear. \u201cI bite, so be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d He snapped his teeth at her.</p><p>A delighted laugh, her claws kneading his shoulders. When she shifted around to sit cross-legged beside him, he put the bag in her lap. The wonder on her face as she took out and opened the velvet-lined box was worth all the trickery it had taken to buy, then hide the gift from her. He owed Pierce one.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She balanced the glass figurine on her palm\u2014of a wolf with its eyes closed, its tail curled around itself. \u201cThe detail...\u201d Gesturing for him to hold it, she retrieved the three other figurines with gentle fingers. They were even smaller\u2014pups frolicking around the sleeping guardian: one growling at a wildflower, another eye to eye with a crow, the third crouched down in a sneaking position.</p><p>Closing the box, she arranged all four on the lid, placing the sneaking pup behind the adult wolf. As if the pup was planning to pounce on the guardian\u2019s tail. He chuckled. \u201cI remember trying to do that to Dad.\u201d</p><p>Adria didn\u2019t answer, simply looked at the tableau, stroking a finger over one of the figurines once in a while. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair.\u201d It was a whisper, her eyes gone huge and damp.</p><p>He\u2019d bought the mischievous set for her because he\u2019d thought it would make her smile ... and he loved the way Adria smiled when she was deeply happy. He\u2019d glimpsed that smile only once, when she\u2019d first looked up from the sheets the morning after they\u2019d danced on the balcony, had come to realize he wanted to see it again and again. But instead of joy, his gift had put tears in her eyes.</p><p>Cupping her jaw, he rubbed his thumb over the elegant arch of her cheekbone. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, pulled away. He didn\u2019t like that, but he let her get up off the bed and place the figurines carefully on the small vanity tucked into a corner. When she returned to straddle him in a single smooth motion, his body responded like a match to a flame, the sexual connection between them white lightning. Her lips were soft and wet as they seduced his, the taste of her an addiction that fought to steal his senses.</p><p>Not right, his wolf growled, this isn\u2019t right.</p><p>\u201cAdria.\u201d Chest heaving, he wrenched her away with a hand fisted in her hair.</p><p>In response, she dug her claws into his shoulders and pushed, her eyes a pale, dangerous amber. It would\u2019ve taken him to the bed if he hadn\u2019t been ready for it. Blood scented the air, sharp and metallic. Snarling, he ripped her hands off him, braceleting and pinning her wrists behind her back with one hand. It didn\u2019t induce her to desist. Thighs locked around him, she angled her head with predatory focus.</p><p>He gripped her jaw when she would\u2019ve snapped forward to sink her teeth into his neck, squeezed. \u201cBehave.\u201d This was a challenge, and he had to win it, or they\u2019d never move past this moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A soft smile, eyes wolf-sly. \u201cRiaz.\u201d Moving her body in a sinuous curve that enticed, she broke his hold on her wrists with a single wrenching move, went to slam her claws into his chest. But he wasn\u2019t stupid, and he knew damn well who he was dealing with\u2014a trained and honed predatory changeling female out to win. Mercy was not something she understood. Not here. Not now.</p><p>Twisting at the last moment, he used her own momentum to pin her to the bed on her front. He manacled her wrists on either side of her body before she could catch her breath, pressing down on her with his much heavier frame. She was smart, she was strong, but in a contest of sheer brute strength, she would never win.</p><p>When he sank his teeth into the smooth curve of her shoulder, she bucked. He continued to hold her until she stilled, her entire body quivering with tension. Releasing his grip on her shoulder, though he continued to pin her wrists, he licked at the mark, then nuzzled aside her hair to press a kiss to her jaw, her face turned sideways on the pillow. \u201cSay it.\u201d</p> <p>The sound of teeth grinding.</p><p>Driven by possession and grim determination both, he allowed more of his weight to fall on her as he licked at the mark he\u2019d made, using slow flicks of his tongue. It was a taunt, and the growl that rumbled up from her chest told him she knew it. But he had her good and pinned, and regardless of how much she strained, she couldn\u2019t throw him off.</p><p>\u201cI yield,\u201d she finally gritted out.</p><p>Not quite trusting her\u2014not in this mood\u2014he released her wrists one at a time before bracing himself above her on one forearm. Using his free hand, he brushed aside the damp tangle of hair from her face and neck, baring the clean line of her profile. \u201cWant me to get off you?\u201d He continued to run his fingers through her hair, petting her to calmness.</p><p>A slight pause before she shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cTell me when I get too heavy,\u201d he murmured, easing his lower body into the lithe curves of her own.</p><p>Her lashes came down over eyes that remained a haunting wild amber, then rose again. \u201cIt feels good.\u201d</p><p>Sliding his hand to her shoulder, he rubbed his thumb gently over the bite mark before reaching up to massage her nape, her scalp. Slow, long minutes passed, but she relaxed at last, going boneless under him. Pressing a hotly possessive kiss to the curve of her jaw, he squeezed her neck. \u201cWe\u2019re not just sex.\u201d</p><p>Riaz had made up his mind to pursue this indefinable, wonderful thing that had grown between him and Adria when neither one of them had been looking, and he wasn\u2019t going to allow the damage done to her by another man to destroy that. \u201cAre we?\u201d It was a question heavy with demand, his fingers tightening.</p><p>She dug her nails into the sheets, her jaw set. He knew she wasn\u2019t physically scared by him being on top of her\u2014they both understood he\u2019d release her the instant she made it clear she wanted out. No, her fear had an altogether different cause, her panic one he could taste in her skin when he licked out at her, the sheen of perspiration that covered her a fine sparkle. \u201cAdria.\u201d</p><p>ADRIA jerked at the unrestrained dominance in that command. For the first time, she realized exactly how careful he\u2019d been with her in their sexual encounters to date\u2014he might have been tender, passionate, and urgent in turn, but he hadn\u2019t allowed her to see into the heart of the black wolf within. This man, the one who was speaking to her in a soft tone that was a hot blade over her skin, this was the primal core of him.</p> <p>His fingers moved against her neck, a silent reminder that he held the reins. Her wolf wasn\u2019t happy with that ... yet it was. The confusion of it caused a chaos of emotion inside her. So long she\u2019d been with a man who had forced her to silence and stifle her true self in a hundred small ways because he hadn\u2019t been strong enough to handle her. Now, she was with a man who not only didn\u2019t have a problem accepting her strength, but who was also strong enough to overpower her in every way that mattered to a changeling.</p><p>Panic burned her gut like acid. She was the one who had always been in control, the one who could stop things before they went too far, before they pushed her too deep into painful emotional territory. \u201cI changed my mind,\u201d she said, her tumult a smoldering blaze inside her skin, swamping all rational thought. \u201cWe need to break it off.\u201d</p><p>Releasing her nape, Riaz began to stroke his hand through her hair again, slow and easy and unmistakably, unbearably possessive. \u201cI can scent your panic.\u201d A kiss on the mark he\u2019d made when he\u2019d bitten her. \u201cTalk to me about it.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t do it, couldn\u2019t expose the naked, vulnerable girl inside the skin of the woman. However, when she went to turn her face away, he lifted his body off her. Another kind of panic stung her, the sense of loss devastating. But she was being turned onto her back before she could react, Riaz\u2019s heat covering her once more as he brushed her hair out of her eyes with his free hand, his other one braced by her head.</p><p>\u201cI saw a cactus in the desert once,\u201d he said, his voice low and deep and a hum over her skin. \u201cCalled Queen of the Night. It had this exquisite creamy flower, and the scent, it intoxicated my wolf. But it only opened at night\u2014you had to be patient to see it.\u201d Eyes of beaten gold. \u201cI\u2019m very patient.\u201d Suckling her upper lip into his mouth in an unexpected kiss, he tore her T-shirt on one side with his claws and\u2014holding her gaze\u2014shaped his hand over her bare rib cage.</p><p>Shivers raced over her frame. She tried to arch into him, sliding her hand around his body to push up his own tee so she could touch the hot, muscled skin of his back. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>But he shook his head. \u201cSex is easy.\u201d He rocked against her, the hot steel of his erection pushing against the slick, needy flesh between her thighs. \u201cI breathe your scent and I\u2019m ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you doing this?\u201d she whispered, one hand fisting against his chest. \u201cLet\u2019s keep it easy, as it was.\u201d No demands, no expectations, no heartbreak. Because she\u2019d been wrong\u2014she wasn\u2019t brave enough to chance more scars, more bruises. Not when this time around, she knew the agony would be so much worse.</p> <p>Her wolf had never adored Martin as it adored the black wolf with the golden eyes.</p><p>Leaning down until his face was a bare inch away, his breath hot against her skin, Riaz said, \u201cBecause it\u2019s too late for that, and you\u2019re not the casual type. You never have been. Just like me.\u201d Crushed rocks and broken glass in his voice.</p><p>It was instinct to curve her hand over his nape, to pet him as he\u2019d petted her. He let her touch him, let her claim skin privileges that were becoming ever more complicated. She\u2019d thought she\u2019d figured everything out in Venice, but tonight, what he\u2019d done, it had touched the secret, idealistically hopeful part of her she\u2019d allowed no one to reach for so long, it was a forgotten memory. The fact he\u2019d already done so, when their relationship had hardly begun, it had her stomach in knots, her heart thumping against her ribs.</p><p>And then there was his dominance.</p><p>He spread his hand on her throat just then, curving it in a gentle hold. \u201cWhat\u2019re you thinking that\u2019s got your wolf so wary?\u201d he asked in a low murmur, rocking once against the molten heat of her.</p><p>She twisted up in instinctive response, had the pleasure of hearing him hiss out a breath between clenched teeth. But though he stroked his hand down to lie possessively over her unfettered breast, he didn\u2019t take the next step, the one that would\u2019ve left them tangled and sweat soaked. \u201cI got used to bending,\u201d she admitted, fighting her pride to expose what a fool she\u2019d been.</p><p>\u201cWith Martin. I had to bend to make him happy.\u201d It had taken place so slowly, she hadn\u2019t understood the corrosive ugliness of what was happening. Small things, she\u2019d thought, things that didn\u2019t really matter\u2014after all, the man had risked everything to save her life. Until she\u2019d realized she\u2019d begun to bury Adria to please Martin. \u201cHe was nowhere near as strong as you.\u201d</p><p>Riaz snorted. \u201cYou\u2019ve been busting my balls since the instant we met\u2014I sure as hell don\u2019t think you\u2019re suddenly going to flutter your lashes and simper at my every word.\u201d</p><p>Wolf and woman both blinked at the ridiculous image. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d She tried to find the words to explain. \u201cMartin made me weak ... No. That\u2019s not fair.\u201d There had been two people in that relationship. \u201cI weakened myself to make him happy. I\u2019m terrified I\u2019ll do the same with you.\u201d That was her flaw, no one else\u2019s.</p><p>Molding her breast with strong fingers, Riaz leaned down to take her lower lip between his teeth, releasing it oh-so-slow. \u201cSo you want to end things before they begin?\u201d A harder squeeze, a deeper hint of teeth along her jaw. \u201cThat\u2019s the real weakness.\u201d</p><p>She dug her claws into his back when he bit her again. \u201cDo that one more time and I\u2019ll give you a nice new tattoo.\u201d</p><p>Lips curving against her neck. \u201cYeah.\u201d His clean-shaven jaw was smooth over her skin. \u201cI\u2019m not real worried about you bending for me.\u201d Pushing up into a kneeling position straddling her hips, he ripped off his T-shirt and threw it to the floor before coming down over her, hands on either side of her head. \u201cOpen your mouth for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a request or an order?\u201d</p><p>A lazy smile that reached his eyes, his mouth capturing hers in hot demand. She rubbed her tongue against his, felt him growl deep in his chest. Shuddering, she pressed her hands to his chest, his muscled body hers to explore. But when she ran her knuckles down the tantalizing line of hair below his belly button and to the top of the jeans that hung sexily low on his hips, he only allowed her to open the top button before tugging away her hand.</p><p>\u201cI get to play first.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d ripped her T-shirt to shreds and was tugging off her pajama bottoms and panties before she realized she was his intended toy. Not resistant to the idea and with a few of her own, she pressed a foot to his chest the instant she was bare to the skin. \u201cGet naked.\u201d Very much an order. \u201cI want full skin privileges.\u201d She craved the sweet, hot slide of his body against hers, the hard male angles and delicious weight of him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A kiss pressed to her foot, and suddenly, she was being flipped onto her front, the cold metal of his zipper biting into her as he settled his weight over her, his cock a hard outline. \u201cNo.\u201d Hot denial in her ear, one big hand shoving under her body to tease and tug at her nipple. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be the boss today.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 46</p><p>\u201cRIAZ.\u201d IT WAS a warning, her claws slicing into the sheets.</p> <p>Chuckling, he laved a kiss on her nape and\u2014to her surprise\u2014obeyed her unspoken demand, rising onto his haunches, his thighs on either side of her hips. Just when she was about to turn over, he put his hands on her back and began to massage downward from her shoulders, his hands strong, his fingers knowing. She moaned.</p><p>By the time he got to the base of her spine, she\u2019d given up even the vaguest thoughts of rebellion. \u201cYou have two dimples here.\u201d A wet, luscious kiss to each that made her moan.</p><p>Apparently fascinated by the spot, he licked each dimple, rubbed his cheek against her skin. \u201cI shaved especially for you.\u201d</p><p>Her toes curled. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d Though she was in no way averse to the rough scrape of his stubble, it melted her that he\u2019d taken the time.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get my payment.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart thudded, every inch of her very aware she was in bed with a big, dangerous wolf who wanted to do distinctly erotic things to her. When he lifted his head, silken strands of hair sliding over her skin, she expected him to get off the bed, remove his jeans, but he stayed in place, moving his hand down to shape and caress her lower curves. \u201cI can scent you, so wet and ready.\u201d</p><p>The musk of the woman beneath him acted as a drug on Riaz\u2019s senses, the slickness of her pure provocation when he circled the entrance to her body with a single finger.</p><p>\u201cRiaz.\u201d Not a warning this time. An invitation, her sweet curves rising to follow his touch.</p><p>Loving her so soft and pleasured, he shifted to kneel lower down her body, unzipping and shoving his jeans down enough to release his cock with a hiss of pleasure-pain. Squeezing his turgid flesh, he fought for control, found enough to caress his hands over her hips. \u201cUp, Empress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmpress?\u201d She brought up her knees in a fluid slide, rising so her back pressed into his chest at the same moment.</p><p>The blunt head of his cock already bathed in her slickness, he simply flexed his hips and pushed into her with slow, exquisitely pleasurable deliberation. \u201cQueen,\u201d he grit out, fingers digging into her hips, \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSweet talker.\u201d His lover\u2019s nails made tiny half-moon crescents on his thighs, her breathing ragged, her back arched, thrusting her breasts forward in sensual display.</p><p>Growling, he reached around to close his hands over the plump mounds. \u201cDo what you will.\u201d</p><p>She moved on him, squeezing and releasing, and he knew he wasn\u2019t going to last much longer. Flicking one taut nipple in a way that always made her clench around him, he slid a hand down to fondle and tease the slippery nub of her clitoris.</p><p>\u201cRiaz!\u201d She spasmed around him in a burst of molten pleasure that ripped a scream out of her. But when she tried to ride him to completion, he dropped his free hand to grip her thigh, halting her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my toy, remember?\u201d This wasn\u2019t just about sex, and he wouldn\u2019t allow her to forget it.</p><p>\u201cThen play with me.\u201d She turned her face to demand a kiss.</p><p>Pleased at her trust, he gave her that kiss, and more, petting and caressing and indulging before he dropped his hand to her clit again. Playing with the hard little bundle of nerves until she was grinding her body against him in wild need, her breasts heavy and sensitive to his every touch, he took hold of her hips.</p><p>\u201cSlow\u201d\u2014he lifted her off his cock, teeth clenched against the need to pound\u2014\u201cand deep\u201d\u2014he slid her back down to her long, hot moan\u2014\u201cand so wet.\u201d</p> <p>This time he lifted her until the head of his cock popped out. Pushing past her passion-swollen entrance made her come around him, her muscles clamping down in feminine demand. Hands rising to squeeze her breasts, he thrust deep, riding out the hot pulses of her pleasure. But he couldn\u2019t come, not yet. Kissing her nape, he stroked his hands down her body to push her gently forward.</p><p>Ending up on her forearms, she shot him an amber-eyed look over the shoulder he\u2019d bitten, her eyes hazy. That\u2019s how he wanted her today. Pleasured and marked and knowing exactly who held the reins. Because while Adria was a dominant, she couldn\u2019t be one in this bed. It would never work, not for either of them.</p><p>Fisting his hand lightly in her hair, he held her gaze as he pulled out, thrust again. And again. And again. Until she screamed and orgasmed so hard around him that her entire body trembled. Only then did he surrender, the orgasm all but ripping him in two.</p><p>HAVING left Naya with Lucas at the Chinatown office, Sascha glanced at the jaguar who\u2019d driven her up when he brought the SUV to a stop near the den at around a quarter to six that night. \u201cI think,\u201d she said, \u201cwe all agree I no longer need a bodyguard here.\u201d It was an implied question.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about trust,\u201d Vaughn responded. \u201cIt\u2019s about showing strength. Our alliance doesn\u2019t change the fact that we\u2019re two predatory changeling packs.\u201d</p><p>Sascha felt her lips curve into a rueful smile. \u201cJust when I think I know everything there is to know about changelings.\u201d</p><p>The amber-blond male wasn\u2019t one of the more tactile sentinels, his reserve part of his nature, but now he rubbed his knuckles against her cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t take back your pack membership.\u201d</p><p>Laughing at the sly feline humor, she got out of the vehicle, her telepathic senses alerting her to the fact they were being watched the en-tire way to the den. Another show of strength, a quiet reminder that SnowDancer had its lethal reputation for a reason. Lara met them at the entrance, her corkscrew curls in a ponytail, the pale lemon yellow of her shirt skimming the curves of her body. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d The healer embraced Sascha with a warmth that was genuine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to make it earlier.\u201d An issue had arisen with a juvenile, something she\u2019d had to handle in her position as mate to the alpha. \u201cThe spike in Alice\u2019s level of consciousness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlight but holding.\u201d Stepping back, Lara smiled at Vaughn, the fox brown of her gaze warm in the way of healers\u2014of all the people in a pack, they were the only ones who had no trouble interacting with, or being welcomed by, other packs, even those who might otherwise be the enemy. \u201cHello, Vaughn. How\u2019s Faith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wanted me to thank you for the photos you sent.\u201d</p><p>Lara waved away his words. \u201cShe saved the lives of those pups with her prediction\u2014she\u2019s got a claim on them now.\u201d</p><p>A quiet nod from Vaughn.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come with us, or head out to catch up with the soldiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, Lara led them to the infirmary, updating Sascha on Alice\u2019s most recent readings as she did so. \u201cThe single bit of good news,\u201d she said as they walked into the infirmary, \u201cis that minor shift in her level of consciousness, but it is so small we have to accept it could be a natural fluctuation.\u201d She gestured to the open door of a patient room. \u201cAlice\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait here,\u201d Vaughn said, taking a watchful position outside the door.</p><p>Leaving the jaguar to his post, Sascha followed Lara inside. As always, Alice lay silent, her body covered by a soft sheet, her skull by a fine computronic skullcap that monitored her cerebral functions, while a number of other thin tubes ran out of her body. However, she was breathing on her own, her chest rising and falling in so gentle a rhythm, it would\u2019ve been easy to miss had the rest of her not been so very motionless.</p><p>Sascha\u2019s attention locked on the fine bones of Alice\u2019s face. Marked by faint lines of tension, that face wasn\u2019t peaceful in repose, as if Alice was fighting from within, struggling to get out. \u201cI can sense her. The emotional resonance is faint, but it is there.\u201d Sascha intended to strengthen it even further, having been mentally honing her ability to amplify, after reading about the technique in the groundbreaking book Alice had written more than a hundred years ago.</p><p>One of the strongest and most unique gifts of a cardinal empath is the ability to dampen emotions. This study has briefly mentioned how that ability can be\u2014and has been\u2014utilized to control riots, but the same skill can be used in reverse to heighten emotions. However, the latter usage has the effect of draining the E, and even cardinals can only actively maintain it for a span of minutes, ranging from three to seven.</p><p>Alice hadn\u2019t described how E abilities worked on the psychic level, the thrust of her thesis more an anthropological study on empaths as a designation. As a result, Sascha had been left with tantalizing clues but no practical guidance. When she had first tried to control a volunteer \u201ccrowd,\u201d she\u2019d exhausted herself in minutes.</p><p>Only later had she realized she\u2019d actually been attempting to force emotion into the crowd rather than dampening their own. It had been a start. While she still hadn\u2019t cracked how to dampen emotions, she did think she could heighten them. \u201cI wish I had a teacher instead of stumbling about in the dark.\u201d It frustrated her at times like this, the power within her that she had no idea how to shape.</p><p>\u201cYou already know more than any other E-Psy on the planet\u2014give yourself a little more time.\u201d Squeezing Sascha\u2019s arm, Lara moved to the control panel at the end of the bed. \u201cThe readings don\u2019t show any problems. You can start whenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>Exhaling quietly to center herself, Sascha took one of Alice\u2019s thin, pallid hands in her own and closed her eyes. However, before she could begin, she had to identify the other emotions that lingered in the vicinity so she could establish a baseline: Lara\u2019s intense focus, her concern; Vaughn\u2019s alert watchfulness and curiosity; the tenor of a deep friendship emanating from two changelings in another patient room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Baseline laid, she narrowed her attention to Alice.</p><p>Frustration.</p><p>Clean, clear but so faint she had to strain to sense it. Isolating the emotion with meticulous care, Sascha began to do what she\u2019d theorized. Instead of bluntly pushing emotion into Alice, she instead \u201chummed\u201d an emotional note that resonated with Alice\u2019s frustration.</p> <p>If it worked as she thought it should, it would change the depth of Alice\u2019s frustration, bring it to the surface of her consciousness. Once there, it should continue to resonate at the higher frequency, stimulating Alice\u2019s mind until the human woman had the strength to break free. Sascha didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d been humming the note, changing the psychic range to find the perfect pitch, when something \u201cclicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing a blip.\u201d Lara\u2019s quietly excited voice came from a distance. \u201cI think it\u2019s working.\u201d</p><p>TWO days after their return from Venice, and Adria had no idea what she was doing about to walk into the Delgado house in San Diego. Riaz had caught her around four that afternoon, just after she\u2019d completed her second session with a unit of Indigo\u2019s novices who wanted to learn the style of martial arts at which Adria was proficient. Sienna Lauren, who\u2019d been the first to sign up, was turning out to be well suited to the discipline.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the underlying order of it,\u201d the young woman had said. \u201cI like the fact the entire art is built on a base of hundreds of set moves that the fighter puts together in unexpected ways.\u201d</p><p>It was Sienna she\u2019d been chatting with when Riaz appeared on the edge of the outdoor training area. \u201cI managed to get two tickets on the high-speed train to San Diego,\u201d he\u2019d said when the younger woman had taken her leave. \u201cDeparting in two hours.\u201d</p> <p>Startled, it had taken her a moment to figure out what he meant. \u201cWe can\u2019t take off again so soon after Venice,\u201d she\u2019d said, heart in her throat.</p><p>\u201cReturn trip tonight\u2014we\u2019ll get back into the den around two a.m. You\u2019re done for the day, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I was planning to catch up on some paperwork.\u201d Like all dominants in charge of minors, she made sure to keep their parents updated with weekly reports.</p><p>\u201cDo it on the train.\u201d He\u2019d tapped her cheek with his finger. \u201cCome on, Empress. I want you to meet my family.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been hit sideways by the emotional import of the request\u2014the fact Riaz had invited her so close to the heart of his personal pack ... it made a thousand butterflies awaken in her stomach.</p><p>\u201cThe gardens are stunning,\u201d she commented now as they stepped out of the taxi, one hand unobtrusively on her abdomen in an effort to soothe the fluttering within.</p> <p>\u201cYou have wonderful taste, dear!\u201d The same small, curvy woman she\u2019d seen at Hawke and Sienna\u2019s mating ceremony appeared unexpectedly from around the side of a sprawling rosebush, hands held out and a huge smile wreathing her face. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to meet you, Adria.\u201d</p><p>Adria leaned down to accept Abigail Delgado\u2019s hug, the scent of her a mix of spices she couldn\u2019t name and a sweet floral note. \u201cMe, too,\u201d she said, suddenly tongue-tied.</p><p>When Abigail stepped back, Adria looked up to see Riaz, dressed in jeans and a chocolate dark shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the elbows, being hugged by a tall man who had such strikingly similar features it was clear they were father and son. The only difference was that the thick black of Jorge Delgado\u2019s hair was faintly threaded with silver, the fine lines at the corners of his eyes and around his mouth adding a quiet depth of character. \u201cGod,\u201d she said without thinking, \u201cRiaz is going to get even more beautiful as he grows older.\u201d</p><p>Abigail\u2019s delighted laugh made Adria color, but Riaz\u2019s mother tucked Adria\u2019s arm into her own and squeezed. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible cross we have to bear, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Meeting those twinkling eyes at the whisper, Adria burst out laughing, the butterflies taking flight to leave her wolf happy on an elemental level. Later that night, when Riaz tucked her to his side as the train punched through the opaque veil of night, she knew the dinner had been akin to the possessive dominance of his loving after Venice\u2014her lone wolf was claiming her in his own quiet, determined, and inexorable way.</p><p>Her heart stuttered, jubilant and terrified in equal measures.</p><p>Chapter 47</p><p>KALEB FOUND HIMSELF at a dead end in the Net, but instead of backing away and attempting to navigate around the section, he examined every aspect of the blockade. It was a black wall. No fractures, no data. Dead space, the Net truncated.</p> <p>Such barricades formed naturally in areas with low population densities. The NetMind shunted the individuals in the zone into the nearest active channel in an exercise in efficiency most people never realized\u2014because the NetMind augmented the Net link of the affected to ensure those men and women felt no strain at being psychically positioned outside their geographic area.</p><p>The problem with this truncated section was that it was almost but not quite far enough away from a relatively dense population matrix. Any gain in efficiency resulting from shifting the minds in this sector wouldn\u2019t have been enough to justify the NetMind\u2019s output.</p><p>Which meant the neosentient entity hadn\u2019t created this roadblock.</p><p>It took him three hours to wedge open a small doorway in the wall of black without tripping the inbuilt alarms. Slipping through, he closed it behind himself, concealing the doorway for later access. The barricade proved to have been nothing but a firewall meant to discourage anyone from continuing to follow the trail\u2014because it was hot again on this side.</p><p>Even as he swept through the slipstream in search of his target, part of his brain continued to sift and sort the millions of pieces of random data that floated past. Rumors, whispers, business information, snippets of fading conversation, it was all filtered out so it wouldn\u2019t clog his mind. Until a single fragment made him pause.</p><p>...pushed the anchor down the steps, but his death...</p><p>Not halting his psychic pursuit, he touched the NetMind\u2019s curious presence, asked it to follow the fragment. The vast neosentience returned to him in a split second with the report that the fragment was all that remained. The rest of the conversation had degraded, its energy absorbed back into the Net.</p><p>Regardless, only one anchor had died in that manner in the preceding weeks. And since the mode of his death had not been made public, the fragment appeared to infer the male had been murdered. What Kaleb couldn\u2019t reason out was why. As he and Aden had discussed, the death of an anchor offered no one in the Net any advantage.</p><p>Following that logic, it was likely the murder was tied to something that had nothing to do with the victim\u2019s position as an anchor. That other reason was often cold, rational money\u2014the anchor\u2019s heirs might simply have wanted to hasten the speed of their inheritance.</p><p>Kaleb sent Aden a telepathic message, taking care not to disturb the trail in front of him. It glowed a faint silver to his psychic senses, and he was almost certain this was it ... when it disappeared with total abruptness.</p><p>I\u2019ll follow up. Aden\u2019s telepathic voice.</p><p>Kaleb responded automatically. Contact me as soon as you discover anything. He scanned his surroundings for any hint of the silver thread. But it was gone as if it had never existed.</p><p>Chapter 48</p><p>FIVE DAYS AFTER the visit to his parents, Riaz watched Adria jog past with a small group of her kids. Perched as he was on top of the jungle gym part of the training run, he had an excellent view, knew she was teaching them one of the emergency evacuation routes they might one day have to utilize to protect the pups, should all the dominants be needed to hold back an invading force.</p><p>Man and wolf both stopped what they were doing to watch the woman who, he was slowly beginning to see, was as much a nurturer as an aggressive protector. An unusual combination, rare in the hierarchy. While she was undoubtedly a dominant soldier with impressive offensive capabilities, there was a gentleness about her that was more akin to that of the maternal females. It was an aspect of her personality he\u2019d brushed up against more than once without realizing it\u2014and it made his protectiveness toward her intensify, until he knew he\u2019d have to be careful not to cross lines that would most definitely annoy his amber-eyed wolf.</p><p>As if sensing his scrutiny, she turned to look over her shoulder, her expression softening. \u201cHey,\u201d she mouthed.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he mouthed back.</p><p>Lips curving, she returned her attention to the teenagers around her, disappearing under the thick canopy of the trees not long afterward. His wolf stretched its neck, trying to catch a final glimpse of her, but it didn\u2019t snarl when the trees continued to block its view\u2014it knew she\u2019d return to him, the bonds between them no longer cobweb fine. What had happened after Venice had changed things on a fundamental level.</p><p>He\u2019d made his decision, made his claim.</p><p>Adria hadn\u2019t rejected his possession\u2014not the same as acceptance, but as he\u2019d told her, he was a patient man. Smiling at the way this skittish wolf was beginning to trust him with pieces of her heart, he turned his attention back to the obstacle course that was the training run. The soldiers had begun to learn the old pattern, which meant it was time to reconfigure it into a new one, which he was doing, with Judd\u2019s help.</p><p>The other lieutenant, his hair back to its normal chocolate brown shade\u2014Riaz\u2019s wolf snorted\u2014teleported him a wrench when he called out for it. \u201cThanks.\u201d He twisted a stubborn bolt into place, his mind going through the issues to be discussed at the upcoming lieutenant meeting. \u201cHeard anything from Ashaya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust an update on how long her initial tests will take,\u201d Judd called out from under the structure. \u201cApproximately a month. Ashaya\u2019s very dogmatic and detail oriented in her work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Unscrewing a small piece, he snapped it into a new position on the right. \u201cBowen\u2014what\u2019s your take?\u201d</p><p>Judd came out from under the structure to look up at him, wiping his forearm across his sweat-damp forehead and leaving a streak of grease behind. \u201cHe is, in a sense, an alpha. The Alliance looks to him for direction and protection\u2014seen that way, his actions may be ruthless, but they\u2019re for the good of his pack.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSpoken like a true wolf.\u201d</p><p>Judd caught the wrench he threw down, waiting until Riaz\u2019s feet hit the ground to say, \u201cAs Drew would say, if you can\u2019t beat \u2019em...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, too late to back out now. We know where you live.\u201d</p> <p>Judd\u2019s response was to put the wrench with the other tools and raise his eyebrow. Of course Riaz couldn\u2019t turn down the challenge, and they were scrambling over the modified jungle gym in seconds. It dumped Judd on his ass two minutes in. Riaz lasted another ten seconds. \u201cDamn,\u201d he said with a satisfied laugh. \u201cGot us both. Excellent.\u201d No one was going to learn to beat this configuration in a hurry.</p><p>Eyes narrowed, Judd stared at the structure as if at a mortal enemy. Slapping his fellow lieutenant on the shoulder, Riaz said, \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d A pissed-off telekinetic versus the complex metal pylons and tubes of the jungle gym\u2014the results would not be pretty.</p><p>Judd glanced at his watch. \u201cI\u2019ll destroy it later.\u201d Cool as ice, but Riaz caught the glint, knew the Tk would be back until he\u2019d beaten the obstacle. \u201cWe\u2019d better get to the meeting. It\u2019s almost two.\u201d</p><p>Heading in, they put away the tools and quickly washed up before walking into the special conference room set up for lieutenant meetings. Hawke and the other lieutenants\u2014via comm link and in person\u2014were all present. Indigo, her feet propped up on a second chair, her legs crossed at the ankles, said, \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d without looking up from her datapad.</p><p>That datapad was suddenly hovering several inches in the air ... before it zipped to a stop in front of Judd. Taking it, he said, \u201cAnd you\u2019re playing Wolf versus Leopard.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone laughed as Indigo threatened Judd with bodily harm, but the Psy lieutenant continued to study the datapad. \u201cYou have an excellent territorial strategy\u2014though it appears this game skews to favor wolves. Was the developer a wolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI confess!\u201d Tom\u00e1s threw up his hands. \u201cIt was me.\u201d</p><p>Nudging the datapad back to Indigo, Judd twisted a chair around to sit with his arms braced on the back. \u201cIf you want cats to play it, too, you have to even out the playing field.\u201d</p><p>Tom\u00e1s\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cI think you just volunteered to be my impartial test player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. As long as I get a share of what are certain to be huge profits, taking the competitiveness of wolves and leopards into account.\u201d</p><p>Tom\u00e1s tapped the side of his nose as more laughter filled the room. \u201cI\u2019ll have my people talk to your people.\u201d</p> <p>Hawke leaned back in his chair, tipping it so it balanced on two legs. \u201cHis \u2018people\u2019 is Brenna, so watch out or you\u2019ll be lucky to come out of it with the shirt on your back.\u201d Hands linked behind his head, he glanced at Riley. \u201cOkay, what\u2019s on the agenda today? Any attempted mini-strikes by Pure Psy I don\u2019t know about?\u201d It was an irritated question. \u201cIt\u2019s like that mole game where they keep popping up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing in the last four days,\u201d Riley replied to a round of applause. \u201cAnd Sam is leading the trap-detection pool with an impressive nine points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour days,\u201d Indigo said in a musing tone of voice. \u201cThat\u2019s the longest gap to date. Strain on their limited personnel beginning to show?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoles reproduce very quickly,\u201d Judd said dryly.</p><p>Jem almost snorted out the water she\u2019d been drinking. \u201cEnough with the moles, let\u2019s not give them the satisfaction of sucking up more of our time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI now declare a mole moratorium.\u201d With that solemn statement\u2014which made Cooper choke\u2014Riley picked up the datapad in front of him. \u201cBlackSea\u2019s first on the list. Kenji, Riaz, give us an update.\u201d</p><p>Riaz nodded at Kenji to answer.</p><p>\u201cWe had a bit of back-and-forth, but they\u2019re now happy with the contract.\u201d Pushing his shockingly sedate black hair out of his eyes, Kenji glanced at Hawke. \u201cThey made their decision about the alliance before they ever approached us. It was just a case of working out the details.\u201d</p> <p>Riaz had to agree. \u201cIt\u2019s going to come down to the meet.\u201d He and Kenji, as well as Riley, would accompany Hawke to the face-to-face with Miane Lev\u00e8que, while BlackSea was sending along Emani and two other representatives of their ruling board with Miane. In deference to BlackSea\u2019s preference to be near water, the meeting was set to take place in a waterfront building owned by DarkRiver. \u201cStill no hint on why they\u2019re suddenly so keen on an alliance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe get an answer at the meet, or we walk.\u201d The alpha\u2019s smile was all teeth. \u201cBeautiful Garnet. Report.\u201d</p><p>Jem rolled her eyes. \u201cNothing new. I\u2019ve still got the steady trickle of Psy coming into my sector. I think the majority are continuing on to San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Indigo said, \u201cCity\u2019s going to start having a population and housing issue if this keeps up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad yet,\u201d Riley replied. \u201cCats are keeping an eye on the situation\u2014there are enough apartments in the general area for the time being. The Psy coming in are staying clear of den territory and DarkRiver\u2019s territorial borders.\u201d</p><p>Coop, who\u2019d touched base with Riaz just yesterday, the two of them bullshitting over the comm, had nothing to report. Neither did Matthias, but Alexei was sporting an impressive black eye and a scowl. However, all he said was, \u201cAll quiet here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way, Sexy Lexie,\u201d Tom\u00e1s said, earning a deadly look, \u201cfess up. Where did you get that shiner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDominance challenge.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s hands dropped, the legs of his chair slamming to the ground as his expression grew dark. \u201cAnother one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry\u2014I took off the kid gloves.\u201d White grooves bracketed his mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s alive ... barely. I don\u2019t think anyone else will want to try their luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Hawke\u2019s tone was without pity. \u201cWe might\u2019ve gained two or three strong soldiers as a result of the challenges, but it\u2019s a waste of your time dealing with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you even put ice on that?\u201d Jem asked, wincing at the damage to Alexei\u2019s face.</p><p>The young lieutenant shrugged. \u201cWasn\u2019t time\u2014I didn\u2019t want to give him a chance to heal up before we delivered him to his pack.\u201d</p><p>The message, Riaz thought, his wolf in complete accord, had to be brutal, unmistakable. \u201cI think,\u201d he said, when Riley turned to him and asked for an update on the Human Alliance, \u201cit might be time to revisit the idea of a permanent liaison with them.\u201d</p><p>The sound of teeth grinding. Nobody had forgotten or forgiven what Bowen had done the last time he\u2019d been in the area.</p><p>Coop was the one who broke the silence. \u201cRiaz is right. The Alliance is too big to simply ignore.\u201d</p><p>Hawke shoved a hand through his hair, asked for opinions. Everyone had one, but they finally decided to feel out some kind of a liaison arrangement.</p><p>\u201cCan you handle that?\u201d Hawke glanced at Riaz. \u201cYou\u2019ve got BlackSea as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKenji can take most of the load there,\u201d he said, receiving a nod from the other lieutenant. \u201cAnd this isn\u2019t a full alliance negotiation.\u201d He caught Judd\u2019s eye. \u201cI might need your input now and then.\u201d The other man had access to the PsyNet, and Riaz knew there were powerful people in the psychic network keeping an eye on the Alliance.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe possible civil war inside the Net,\u201d Indigo said to Judd. \u201cAny news on that front?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose to ignition\u2014all it needs is a single match.\u201d A chilling prediction. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten the word out among the Psy in the city. The forewarning may save some of them.\u201d</p><p>Some, Riaz thought, not all.</p><p>CLOSING the door to her office after completing the day\u2019s session with the kids, Adria wiped her hands on her jeans, took a deep breath, and put through the call. It was answered on the second ring, her mother\u2019s vivid blue eyes filling the computer screen, the honey brown of her hair tumbling over her shoulders\u2014it was Cullan Morgan who had given his daughters the ebony of their hair, but Tarah\u2019s and Adria\u2019s eyes came from Felicity.</p><p>\u201cAdria.\u201d Heartfelt smile on her face, her mom reached toward the screen as if to touch Adria, then dropped her hand with a rueful smile. \u201cHow are you, my baby girl?\u201d</p><p>Adria\u2019s heart clenched at the love that sang in her mother\u2019s every word. She\u2019d kept her distance from her parents for too long, driven by a caustic mix of shame and anger, and her wolf ached to feel the fierceness of her mother\u2019s embrace, the rough affection of her father\u2019s touch. \u201cGood. I went to Venice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how lovely. I know you always wanted to.\u201d Felicity beamed, glanced over her shoulder. \u201cCullan, come here! Your pumpkin\u2019s on the comm.\u201d</p><p>Adria laughed, knowing that regardless of her age or rank, she\u2019d always be their surprise baby. \u201cHi, Dad,\u201d she said when her father\u2019s handsome face filled the screen.</p><p>\u201cI should spank you, Adria Morgan,\u201d was his growling response, his beard sprinkled liberally with silver. \u201cWhen are you planning to visit your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon as I can get three or four days of leave in a row.\u201d Her parents were based in Los Angeles as a result of her mother\u2019s position at the university, her father in charge of SnowDancer\u2019s construction arm in the city. \u201cRiley\u2019s in a very good mood, so I might be able to swing it in the next few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I heard,\u201d her mother said with a delighted grin. \u201cHe\u2019ll make a wonderful father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he will,\u201d Cullan agreed. \u201cAlways had a steady head on his shoulders\u2014even when he was making trouble with Hawke, Cooper, Riaz, and the others when they were younger.\u201d</p><p>Adria had decided to keep her silence on her deepening relationship with Riaz. It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t want to share her family with him, didn\u2019t want her parents to meet the intelligent, passionate lone wolf who was twining ever stronger bonds around her heart, but that she had to be dead certain. Never again did she want her mother and father to worry and hurt as they had when she\u2019d been with Martin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, the next time she introduced a man to her family, it would be because she knew he loved her with his heart and soul, his devotion unflinching.</p><p>Chapter 49</p><p>SIENNA\u2019S NERVES WERE shot by the time she shoved into Hawke\u2019s empty office and sprawled in his chair late that afternoon. The scent of him surrounded her, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Scowling because she wanted to sulk with him, she got up, deciding to track him down like he so often did her.</p> <p>It didn\u2019t take long\u2014because she knew who to ask.</p><p>\u201cI saw him, Sinna!\u201d Ben volunteered when she interrogated the kids in the White Zone. \u201cHe\u2019s fixing a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ben.\u201d She kissed his cheek\u2014and the cheeks of all the other pups who\u2019d gathered around\u2014then made her way down to the garage.</p><p>Hawke wasn\u2019t, in fact, \u201cfixing a car.\u201d He was discussing a rugged all-wheel-drive vehicle that looked like it had been taken apart piece by piece, with the head mechanic. Staying out of sight, she didn\u2019t interrupt what seemed to be an important conversation, but she knew he was aware of her, his wolf rubbing against the mating bond in a primal hello.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how she knew which part of him she was talking to at any given time. She just did. And she\u2019d learned to stroke the wolf through the bond, did so now. When Hawke finished his conversation and walked across to her, he just tapped her on the cheek and said, \u201cMy office,\u201d having clearly sensed her mood.</p> <p>The instant they entered it, he raised an eyebrow. \u201cSomeone\u2019s been sitting in my chair.\u201d</p><p>She slumped in it again. \u201cThe maternal females hate me.\u201d</p><p>Pale, pale blue eyes suspiciously bland, Hawke leaned back against his desk in front of her and looked down to meet her no-doubt temper-foul gaze. \u201cI\u2019m guessing shadowing Ava didn\u2019t work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer baby was fussy today, so she arranged for me to shadow Nell instead.\u201d Cocking her fingers, she pretended to shoot herself in the head. \u201cDo you know how many times I was pulled up in front of Nell as a juvenile? Well, she does. Has a memory like a steel trap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop laughing,\u201d Sienna muttered, glaring at her mate though he hadn\u2019t made a sound. \u201cThis is serious.\u201d</p> <p>An infuriating chuckle before he used his foot to push the chair away, then pull it back in so she ended up between his legs. \u201cTell me exactly what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI showed up to meet Nell in the nursery, and we spent an hour with the pups. That was nice.\u201d She loved the innocence of the babies, the way the toddlers shrieked in delight, their joy guileless and forthright. \u201cIt was when we left that Nell decided to wander down memory lane. Her \u2018favorite\u2019\u201d\u2014she hooked her fingers to create air quotes\u2014\u201cone about me is from that time my class was camping in the mountains, and I convinced the girls to steal and hide every single stitch of clothing owned by the boys. She said she was impressed by the precision timing involved in the raid.\u201d</p><p>Hawke remembered the incident, and the punishment he\u2019d meted out to all those involved\u2014fighting the urge to congratulate the girls on the sheer audacity of the stunt the entire time. \u201cNell probably was impressed.\u201d He sure as hell had been.</p><p>Responding with that adorable growling sound he loved, Sienna pushed herself back until his chair pressed against the wall, her legs kicked out in front of her. \u201cShe then made me sit through a discipline session with two of the younger teens\u2014it was like a bad rerun of my life. Later, she took me to a meeting where the senior maternal dominants all worked around a quilt. I can hardly sew enough to complete emergency repairs in the field!\u201d</p><p>Hmm... \u201cDid she invite you back?\u201d</p><p>A grumpy nod.</p><p>Delight had him hooking his foot under the chair and rolling her back toward him. \u201cAsk me the name of the reigning champ of trouble in the den before you came along?\u201d</p><p>Sienna\u2019s continued black mood was apparent in her muttered, \u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNell.\u201d</p><p>That got her attention. \u201cNell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And she held the title for ten years. So\u201d\u2014he leaned down with his hands braced on the arms of her chair\u2014\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s definite that she was impressed by that raid.\u201d</p><p>Biting down on her lower lip, his mate said, \u201cThe quilting meeting?\u201d in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s where the maternals get most of their business done. And they don\u2019t invite just anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sienna rubbed a hand over her face. \u201cTo be honest, the meeting was painless in comparison to the time I spent with Nell\u2014I felt like I was being raked over the coals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you respond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI treated her with the respect due to her as one of the most senior people in the den.\u201d Lashes down, back up. \u201cThough I did get a little irritated when she pushed too hard\u2014and I might have pointed out that I\u2019m an adult female now and not particularly interested in rehashing my past exploits. That\u2019s when she took me to the quilting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, claiming a hard kiss before rising to his full height once again. \u201cIf you\u2019d let her walk all over you, you\u2019d never have been invited to the meeting.\u201d Slender Nell might appear young and almost fragile, but the leader of the maternals had a spine of titanium, and appreciated the same in others. \u201cThe fact you can\u2019t sew is irrelevant\u2014they bloody well give me a needle and thread when I attend.\u201d</p><p>Sienna spit out a startled laugh, the stars returning to her eyes. \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind them I\u2019m alpha.\u201d The wolf snarled. \u201cThen I sit and I listen.\u201d Because the maternals were the backbone of the pack, the ones who made them family, gave them heart.</p><p>\u201cI made myself useful cutting pieces for the quilt,\u201d Sienna said, \u201cbut mostly I listened, too.\u201d A long, shuddering release of breath. \u201cSo ... it wasn\u2019t a disaster?\u201d Hesitant, quiet, a request for reassurance.</p><p>It fucking killed him each time she exposed the depth of her trust in him, this woman who, as a scared, lonely child, had been taught not to trust anyone. \u201cNot even close,\u201d he said, crooking a finger. \u201cI\u2019d call it an unmitigated success.\u201d</p><p>Rising, Sienna pressed her body to his, her fists tucked against his chest. Cuddling her close, he rubbed his jaw against her temple. \u201cYou\u2019re doing beautifully.\u201d He knew she was walking this road not simply for herself, but for him, for SnowDancer, so the pack would know they could have faith in the strength of their alpha couple.</p><p>Pride and love vied for space inside him, collided in a powerful punch of emotion. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, running his hands down her back. \u201cLet\u2019s sneak into our quarters for an early dinner.\u201d He wanted to touch her, pet her, adore her, hold her.</p><p>CAUGHT up on work the next day, and with her and Drew\u2019s next climbing tutorial not until later, Adria found herself a sunny seat on a giant boulder in the White Zone just before lunch. She wanted to sit and fiddle with a small computronic engine part the mechanics had discarded as too much trouble to fix. It was, but she liked the challenge. She was almost sure she\u2019d figured out a partial workaround when she caught a scent that was now embedded in her very skin.</p><p>Her wolf rose, padding to the surface of her mind, and she dropped the hand holding the part to her thigh to focus on him, this lone wolf who was becoming her own ... though he would never be hers. His stride was confident, a man sure of his strength. But he wasn\u2019t unbending, was capable of a tenderness that threatened to make her fall so deep, she\u2019d never recover.</p><p>Reaching her, he glanced at the engine piece, angled his head in a silent question.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hobby,\u201d she said, sliding the piece and her miniature tool set into a pocket of her buff-colored cargos, feeling oddly shy. As if this were their first date and he\u2019d caught her playing like a child. \u201cA puzzle to solve.\u201d</p><p>Placing the brown paper bag in his hand on the boulder, he reached into his own pocket to pull out a small, polished wooden carving of a leopard mid-prowl. \u201cMy hobby,\u201d he said, standing the leopard on her palm. \u201cIt\u2019s not finished.\u201d</p><p>Astonished and charmed, she ran her finger along the back of the incredibly lifelike animal. \u201cWhen do you do this?\u201d She was fascinated. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere and there, when I\u2019m thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have it?\u201d</p><p>A glint of gold in the pale brown, the wolf\u2019s delight. \u201cWhen it\u2019s done.\u201d Plucking it from her fingers, he slipped it back into his pocket. \u201cShow me what you were doing with the part.\u201d</p><p>Retrieving it, she explained, while he stood between her parted knees, one of his hands on her thigh, his hair shining blue-black in the sunlight. It was a subtle intimacy, and it wrapped her in silken chains\u2014she had to concentrate to get the words out, wasn\u2019t sure she breathed until he said, \u201cThat looks like fun,\u201d in an intrigued tone. \u201cI want to take one apart with you.\u201d</p><p>A laugh bubbled out of her. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><p>Stealing her laugh with a kiss that was pure hot, wet demand, he squeezed her thigh before reaching to get something from the bag he\u2019d brought over. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>It was a sandwich. \u201cChicken and avocado,\u201d she murmured, another piece of the hard shell around her heart falling away. \u201cMy favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your sugar and cream with a dash of coffee.\u201d Placing the thermal cup and his bottle of water on the boulder, he took out his own sandwich.</p><p>The sun warmed her shoulders as he turned to brace his back against the stone, her thighs on either side of his bigger, more muscular frame. When she pressed an impulsive kiss to his nape, he made a low, rumbling sound in his chest, a wolf pleased. All of her\u2014body and soul\u2014trembled in visceral response.</p><p>Dangerous, she thought, this was so dangerous. Too many pieces of her in his hands. She had to hold something back, some part of her that would protect her against the nights she woke to find him lying awake, a faraway expression on his face. Because it would happen\u2014no matter the passionate tenderness growing ever deeper between them, she was second best, would always be second best. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The harsh truth of it bruised her heart. Putting down her mostly uneaten sandwich, she rubbed her hand surreptitiously over the organ. She didn\u2019t know if she was trying to quell the ache or contain the wild fury of what she felt for Riaz. But she had the sinking feeling it was too late. Perhaps it had been too late the instant her wolf first responded to him, the attraction visceral.</p><p>Having finished his sandwich, he turned to grab his water, saw hers. \u201cEat the rest.\u201d</p><p>Already on edge, she bristled. \u201cSince when do you get to give me orders?\u201d</p> <p>Eyes of pale gold met hers, lashed by black silk. \u201cSince I realized you have a tendency to not eat properly.\u201d Picking up the sandwich, he held it out.</p><p>She took it, placed it back down. \u201cDon\u2019t try to control me.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s voice was a deep rumble. \u201cI will not let my woman mistreat herself. Eat the sandwich or we\u2019ll be here all day.\u201d</p><p>My woman.</p><p>Her throat choked up, until she couldn\u2019t speak, every part of her hotly conscious of the hand he\u2019d placed once more on her thigh. A couple of inches higher and he could slide that big hand to cup her with the same intimacy he\u2019d done last night, in the hushed dark of her bed. The rough heat of his body so close, the dusky bronze of his skin an invitation to her lips, it stole her mind, made it impossible to think.</p> <p>Pushing aside his hand, she brought her legs up to crouch on the boulder\u2014then jumped off the other side. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll eat the sandwich later\u201d\u2014her heartbeat punching into her throat\u2014\u201cif I feel like it.\u201d This had nothing to do with the sandwich, they both knew that.</p><p>Narrowed eyes. \u201cYou really want to challenge me over this?\u201d</p><p>His tone raised her wolf\u2019s hackles ... and shot adrenaline through her body. \u201cYou know, why don\u2019t you eat it, since you seem to like it so much.\u201d With that, she turned and sauntered into the forest, ensuring her hips swayed in a way designed to further arouse his most dominant instincts.</p><p>RIAZ stared into the trees where Adria had disappeared, his wolf at snarling attention. If she thought he\u2019d just let her go after that kind of provocation, she had no idea who she was dealing with. Taking the sandwich, he wrapped it up in the paper bag and slid it into the pocket of his jeans. It was going to be squashed all to hell by the time he ran her down, but his empress would damn well eat it.</p><p>A grim smile on his lips, he was on his way into the forest when a small body barreled into his legs. \u201cWhoa!\u201d Grabbing the pup, Riaz set him upright.</p><p>But the boy wobbled, his face screwed up in a childish effort not to cry.</p> <p>\u201cHey.\u201d Crouching down, Riaz checked the pup over, discovered a sprained ankle. \u201cCome on, little buddy.\u201d He took the boy into his arms. \u201cWe\u2019d better go see Lara.\u201d</p><p>The distraught pup attached himself to Riaz like a limpet and wouldn\u2019t let go until his mother arrived at the infirmary, by which time Adria had a fifteen-minute head start. However, Riaz was a lieutenant and one of the best trackers in the pack. It took him only two minutes to pick up the crushed berries and ice and wild musk of her scent, another thirty seconds to realize two very important things.</p><p>One, Adria had run full-tilt the instant she was out of his sight; and two, she\u2019d made an attempt to cover her tracks, so she clearly understood the consequences of the gauntlet she\u2019d thrown in his face. His blood turned hot, the chase suddenly a very adult game ... until her tracks, no longer concealed in any way, showed that she\u2019d slowed down to a walk.</p><p>He bared his teeth.</p><p>Adria thought he\u2019d given up. That was her second mistake. Her first had been to taunt him in the first place. Stalking her in silence, he tracked his quarry to a natural pool fed by two streams, taking care to remain upwind. A pile of discarded clothes lay on the bank, but that wasn\u2019t what drew his eye.</p><p>Sleek and wet, she rose up out of the clear water, reaching back to squeeze the excess moisture out of her hair. Her nipples were hard, bitable points from the chill of the wind, her skin cream licked with gold. Flexing and unflexing hands that wanted to stroke and pet and possess, he dipped his gaze to the dark triangle between her thighs, his body rigid with the need to drive his cock into the molten tightness of her.</p><p>No more running, my stubborn, beautiful soldier.</p><p>Chapter 50</p> <p>ADRIA FINISHED WRINGING out her hair and considered whether or not to use her T-shirt to blot her body dry. She could always shift and return home in wolf form. It might be best if she did, because she wasn\u2019t sure she could hide the painful depth of her disappointment otherwise.</p><p>The chase had been a test, a game put in motion by the wolf that lived within her, wary and hopeful and with the courage to roll the dice. She\u2019d needed to know Riaz cared enough to be pissed off, enough to follow. Changeling males who\u2019d claimed a female were touchy about the kind of challenge she\u2019d handed down, never simply allowed one to pass. That he had made it clear that though he\u2019d called her \u201chis\u201d woman, it was only the shallowest of commitme\u2014</p><p>\u201cI like what you\u2019re wearing.\u201d</p><p>She was hauled back against a hard male body, one of his hands splayed possessively on her navel, the other cupping her breast to pluck at her nipple before the import of that deep male voice registered. Her pulse turned into a hammer, her breath coming in soft gasps.</p><p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m a little late,\u201d he murmured in a way she knew meant trouble. \u201cPup emergency.\u201d</p><p>Relief and exhilaration threatened to make her melt against him ... but she was a dominant female wolf. Slicing out her claws, she went to break his hold, but he\u2019d read her intent\u2014she found herself being spun around, her wrists imprisoned behind her back. He was using only one hand, but his hold was unbreakable.</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t nice.\u201d He gripped her jaw hard enough that she couldn\u2019t use her teeth against him, and bent to take a bite out of the side of her breast.</p><p>\u201cThat hurt!\u201d She clenched her thighs, the delicate folds between her legs slick with a moisture that made lie of her attempt at a snarl. \u201cRiaz.\u201d</p><p>Hot, wet laps of his tongue. \u201cYou liked it.\u201d He squeezed her jaw in warning when she growled low in her throat, eyes of wolf gold looking into her own. \u201cBehave.\u201d</p><p>She might not have been a lieutenant, but neither was she a submissive. Not telegraphing her actions in any way, she brought up her knee at the same time that she snapped forward her head.</p><p>Rearing away, Riaz blocked the groin strike, but the dual attack distracted him enough that she was able to free herself. Slashing out with her claws before he could regain his balance, she scored four perfect lines across his chest, shredding his tee. Red seeped into the edges of the white fabric, but the cuts weren\u2019t deep. Only enough to remind him that he was playing with a strong, dangerous woman, not an untried girl.</p><p>Tugging off the torn T-shirt, he threw it aside. \u201cNow,\u201d he said, stalking her with slow, prowling steps and an unblinking stare, \u201cI\u2019ll have to do more than just bite you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God. Seeing his nostrils flare, the tang of her arousal thick in the air, she fought the primal urge to pin him to the earth skin to skin, and shot him a deliberately provocative smile. \u201cI don\u2019t see you anywhere near me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed ... right before he lunged at her. The solitary reason she got away was because she danced left and into the deep pool created by the convergence of two streams. Coming up a second later, she saw him crouched on the verge, watching her, his head angled in a very wolfish way. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, I\u2019ll stay in here then.\u201d</p><p>Thick black lashes lowered to hood his eyes. \u201cI just saw an eel swim past.\u201d</p><p>She jerked. \u201cNo you didn\u2019t.\u201d Except what was that brushing her leg? Yelping, she jumped a fraction to the right, glared at him when he chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re making it up.\u201d</p><p>A grin that was all teeth. \u201cCome out and I\u2019ll only bite you a little.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered against the impact of him so playful and more than a tiny bit dangerous. That was it, she was a goner. Dead and buried. Don\u2019t give in. It was a command from her wolf\u2014who understood that the male stalking her was having fun. So was she.</p><p>Treading water, she shook her head. \u201cThanks for the offer, but I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, he dug his now-bare feet into the grass and settled in, watching her with that same unwavering and unquestionably predatory focus. \u201cIt\u2019s right behind you,\u201d he said a minute later, the tension between them a thrumming bowstring. \u201cWith a friend.\u201d</p><p>She spun around, backed up. \u201cLia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotcha.\u201d He hauled her out of the water and pinned her to the soft grass in a single powerful move.</p><p>Nipples rubbing against the exquisite friction of his chest hair, she wrapped her legs around the possessive intrusion of his hips. \u201cYou just wanted me close enough to grab.\u201d She scratched lightly at his shoulders with the very tips of her claws.</p><p>Arching into the caress, he said, \u201cI\u2019m a wolf. What did you expect?\u201d He slid his hand between her thighs with a boldness that intoxicated. \u201cLet\u2019s play a different game now.\u201d Thumb and forefinger slick with the creamy evidence of her welcome, he rubbed the taut bundle of nerves that was her clit.</p><p>Shuddering, she said, \u201cYes,\u201d and tugged his head down for a kiss that ended with his tongue in her mouth and his fingers pushing inside her in hard male demand. \u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>AN hour later, Riaz\u2019s hand trembled as he stroked it over the damp silk of Adria\u2019s hair, her face peaceful in sleep. His beautiful, prickly, wounded Adria had fallen asleep in his arms after the playful dance of their loving. He understood what that meant, knew he\u2019d reached a part of her most people didn\u2019t even realize existed.</p><p>It was only fair.</p><p>Because she\u2019d reached deep into his soul, too, to places he\u2019d thought would remain forever barren. Quite simply, he was happy. Cautious eyes, claws and all, Adria made him happy. He\u2019d worried his wolf would fight him, fight how hard he\u2019d fallen for her, but the predator in him was delighted with the lover who had become a friend ... and who now owned a great big chunk of his heart. It nuzzled against her as he indulged his bone-deep need for skin privileges by caressing the sweep of her back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Adria Morgan.\u201d</p><p>It was a punch to the throat, the discovery that he was still capable of such a visceral depth of emotion. Finding then losing Lisette hadn\u2019t withered away the part of him that felt a wild possessive tenderness toward the long-limbed goddess in his arms, and where once he would\u2019ve seen his feelings for Adria as a betrayal, he now saw them as a gift. He\u2019d been given a second chance.</p><p>Her lashes fluttered up at that instant, sleepy eyes of mountain-sky blue streaked with veins of precious metals, looking up at him. \u201cWas I sleeping?\u201d</p> <p>It was instinct to play with her. \u201cYou snore adorably.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, her voice even huskier with sleep, she pretended to pull his nose. \u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnore adorably.\u201d</p><p>He bared his teeth at her. She bared hers back. Filled with affectionate joy, the brick that had been a crushing weight on his soul crumbling away to nothing, he drew a line in the sand. Never again would he look back.</p> <p>Lisette was his past, Adria his future.</p><p>RILEY finished his cell phone conversation with Kenji in relation to the BlackSea meet and glanced over to where his mate stood at Nate and Tammy\u2019s kitchen window, her eyes trained on something outside. They\u2019d driven down because he\u2019d needed to return some tools he\u2019d borrowed from Nathan, and since she\u2019d been off shift, Mercy had come along to catch up with Tamsyn\u2014and take the opportunity to \u201cdress like a girl.\u201d</p><p>Having chosen a strappy dress patterned with bright yellow sunflowers, she\u2019d pulled her red hair back in a high ponytail and slipped her feet into simple white flip-flops decorated with a single daisy at the toes. She looked sunny and pretty and girly\u2014and he knew damn well she\u2019d worn those shoes because she could kick them off in a second and haul ass, should it be necessary for the protection of the pack.</p><p>Smile widening, he walked over to slide his arm around her waist and nuzzle a kiss to the creamy slope of her neck. \u201cWhat\u2019s so interesting?\u201d he murmured in a sub-vocal whisper, conscious of Nate and Tamsyn teasing one another at the table on the other side of the kitchen bench.</p><p>\u201cFaith is having hysterics.\u201d</p><p>Wolf immediately on alert, he followed her line of sight to see the spectacle of tranquil, graceful Faith NightStar doubled over in the DarkRiver healer\u2019s backyard, laughing too hard to reply to whatever it was her bemused mate was saying. She and Vaughn had swung by fifteen minutes earlier to drop off a box of medical supplies they\u2019d picked up for Tamsyn, had ended up staying for coffee.</p> <p>Now, the F-Psy finally stopped giggling long enough to say something to Vaughn. The jaguar\u2019s grin could best be described as shit-eating.</p><p>Mercy\u2019s claws hissed out.</p><p>Riley squeezed her waist. \u201cDo you want to know?\u201d His wolf paced in excitement\u2014man and wolf both liked knowing things in advance, but Riley was aware Mercy preferred surprises. He\u2019d go with her choice on this, since it was highly unlikely he\u2019d be able to keep his mouth shut if Faith had foreseen what he thought she had.</p><p>Because right before Kenji\u2019s call distracted him, Riley had caught Faith staring at Mercy, cardinal eyes huge. A second later, the F-Psy had developed a sudden cough, strong enough that she\u2019d had to step outside. Clearly, Mercy had already connected the same dots he just had.</p><p>\u201cI love surprises,\u201d she whispered, retracting her claws and placing her hand on the as yet flat curve of her abdomen, \u201cbut I think this time, for our sanity, we\u2019d better find out what she\u2019s seen in our future.\u201d</p><p>Riley rubbed her lower back. \u201cProbably a hellion redhead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps a stubborn wolf pup who likes to get his own way.\u201d</p><p>Grinning at one another, they turned to Nate and Tamsyn. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back in a second,\u201d Mercy said, tugging him toward the door.</p> <p>It took them only seconds to reach Faith and Vaughn. \u201cSpill it,\u201d Mercy ordered the instant they were close enough.</p><p>The F-Psy wiped tears from her eyes, her smile the sweetest innocence. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me beat it out of you, Faith NightStar. Just tell us\u2014is our child going to drive us that insane?\u201d</p><p>For some reason, the question set Faith off again. She laughed so hard she ended up sitting on the ground, Vaughn crouched beside her. Rubbing her back, the jaguar attempted to look solemn. He failed miserably, his cheeks creased in a rare grin. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cthe future is mutable, subject to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing from Faith\u2019s response that this particular aspect of it is pretty much set in stone.\u201d Folding her arms, Mercy tried to breathe past the bubbles of incipient delight in her bloodstream. \u201cOur baby\u2019s going to shift into a wolf, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Adorable, she thought, their pup would be downright adorable, his cute face a miniature copy of Riley\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Faith pursed her lips together.</p><p>\u201cInto a leopard?\u201d Riley\u2019s delight was transparent. \u201cWith Mercy\u2019s pattern of spots?\u201d</p><p>A spurt of laughter before Faith said, \u201cHmm,\u201d again.</p><p>\u201cFaith.\u201d It was a shared growl.</p><p>Sharing a cagey look with her mate, the F-Psy said, \u201cI think Tammy handles her boys real well, don\u2019t you?\u201d in a musing tone of voice.</p><p>Mercy\u2019s legs collapsed under her. \u201cNu-huh,\u201d she said, aware of Riley coming down beside her. \u201cI am not having twins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not.\u201d Faith\u2019s immediate response was strangely disappointing when the idea of twins had been such a shock. \u201cYou know how foresight works\u2014things are never crystal clear, and multiple births are rare.\u201d Rising to her feet, she held out a hand to Vaughn. \u201cLet\u2019s go drink that coffee.\u201d</p><p>Mercy\u2019s head was so turned around, it took her brain until after the other couple had left the yard to process what Faith had actually said. \u201cMultiple births.\u201d Her no-doubt punch-drunk eyes slammed into Riley\u2019s. \u201cMultiples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2019s sure we\u2019re not having twins.\u201d Riley looked alternately ecstatic and dazed. \u201cChangelings have a lower birth rate than Psy or humans, but within that, we do have a higher rate of multiple births than the other races.\u201d</p><p>Mercy stared at him. \u201cHow can you be so calm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t wait to kiss the babies you give me, kitty cat.\u201d Taking her into his arms, he nipped her affectionately on the jaw. \u201cOne or three or five, I hope they all have their mama\u2019s spirit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother always said my punishment for giving her countless gray hairs before she was thirty would be little terrors of my own.\u201d Stealing a kiss from those firm lips, she said, \u201cHopefully, your genes will balance mine out and we\u2019ll get gorgeous, well-behaved auburn-haired babies who listen to their mother.\u201d</p><p>Riley stared at her ... and then they were laughing and kissing and holding on to one another, happy and scared and nervous all at once.</p><p>ALICE</p><p>FROM: Lara&lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>TO: Sascha&lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;;</p><p>Ashaya&lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;;</p><p>Tammy&lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;;</p><p>Amara&lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>DATE: Sep 22, 2081 at 1.21 p.m.</p><p>SUBJECT: Patient A</p><p>I wanted to give you an update on the results of Sascha\u2019s visit.

While the place was meant to be off-limits to the rest of the pack, they\u2019d realized they enjoyed inviting friends over at times.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Hawke said, before taking a sip. \u201cWhich redhead are we saluting? My redhead, Mercy, Faith, or your future spawn?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll of them.\u201d Riley spread his arms expansively. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll thank you to call my spawn pups or cubs, or pupcubs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPupcubs.\u201d Hawke mused. \u201cI like it.\u201d</p><p>From her chair on the porch, Mercy shook her head at Sienna. \u201cThe boys are drunk.\u201d</p><p>Sienna was fascinated. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Hawke drunk. Or Riley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d Mercy said, her tone that of a wise teacher, \u201cis celebratory drunkenness. Witnessed at times when men rejoice in their own prowess.\u201d</p><p>Riley glanced over his shoulder to grin\u2014actually grin\u2014at Mercy. \u201cI gave you multiple pupcubs. I have prowess.\u201d</p> <p>Eyes dancing, Mercy walked to sit behind him on a higher step, so he could lean against her chest. \u201cYes, you did, and yes, you do.\u201d</p><p>Sienna realized she was grinning, and when Hawke shot her a wolfish smile, she couldn\u2019t help but obey the silent order to sit with him as Mercy was doing with Riley. Later, the DarkRiver sentinel pulled her aside for a second. \u201cThese two are both hardheaded,\u201d the other woman said, the words affectionate, \u201cbut after this much celebration, even his Alphaness will have a hangover. Be gentle.\u201d</p><p>Sienna certainly didn\u2019t have to be gentle that night\u2014Hawke was in a mood, and oh her body liked it. With energy to burn and then some, he exhausted her into limp incoherence before tucking her possessively against him, nuzzling his face into her neck and falling asleep.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move for eight hours.</p><p>Showered and dressed after she managed to wriggle out of his embrace by promising him all sorts of lavish things she wasn\u2019t sure he heard, she sat down on the bed with a mug of coffee and brushed back his hair. One eye opened the merest slit. Closed. A groan sounded. \u201cShut the curtains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not open.\u201d Given the unpredictable effect of alcohol on Psy abilities, she\u2019d never been drunk, but she\u2019d seen her friends in the condition, kept her voice to a whisper. \u201cI have coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrr.\u201d He refused to move.</p><p>Laughter bubbled in her chest. \u201cIt\u2019s my special blend.\u201d Breathing deep, she took a sip. \u201cAnd you have a comm-conference in forty-five minutes.\u201d He could do it from here, but he needed to be conscious for it.</p> <p>\u201cTell Riley to handle it.\u201d Spoken into his pillow.</p><p>\u201cRiley was more drunk than you and is probably still comatose.\u201d Putting the coffee on the bedside table, she snuggled back into bed beside him.</p><p>Eyes remaining closed, he flung an arm around her waist and hauled her against him. \u201cI can hear you thinking.\u201d Grumpy.</p><p>\u201cWhat if when we do decide to have children, I only conceive one?\u201d</p><p>Another slit of husky blue. \u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just ... Is it better to have twins or triplets?\u201d He and Riley had been so delighted by the news. \u201cWe could ask the medics to ensure that.\u201d Though, the leopards had been as overjoyed at Naya\u2019s birth and she was a single baby.</p><p>Hawke closed his eye. \u201cI love you, but I have a hangover and you\u2019re talking crazy.\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to understand.\u201d</p><p>Giving a deep, complaining groan, he opened both eyes. \u201cHow many makes no difference\u2014me and Riley, we\u2019d have gotten drunk sooner or later. He\u2019s the first one of us to have a kid. Get it?\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cLike if it was Evie or Maria or someone else in my group.\u201d She did get it. \u201cIt\u2019s a milestone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s fucking hilarious that Riley, without whom the den would fall apart, is half terrified at the fact he\u2019s about to become a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a best friend would find his nerves hilarious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod you\u2019re adorable, even when you\u2019re talking loud enough to wake the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m whispering,\u201d she pointed out with another scowl, and, rubbing her hand against the bristles on his cheek, got up. \u201cDrink this coffee or I\u2019ll open the curtains.\u201d Energetic and busy as he was, she\u2019d never had to deal with him so surly in the morning\u2014it was fun discovering this unexpected facet of his personality.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me orders. I\u2019m the alpha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like it\u2019s my first time tangling with a wolf?\u201d Reaching down, she pulled the sheet off him, exposing the nude length of his body, his skin golden even in the dim light.</p><p>Oh my.</p><p>Really, he had no right to be so gorgeous.</p><p>Painful as it was to turn her back on the delicious man in her bed, she went to the curtains. \u201cYou now have thirty-five minutes and these curtains are ... open.\u201d</p><p>No sound.</p><p>She turned to find he had a pillow over his head.</p><p>Laughing, she bounced onto the bed and kissed her way down his spine. \u201cFine,\u201d she said, utterly in harmony with the world, \u201clet\u2019s stay in bed all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeasing wench.\u201d He got rid of the pillow. \u201cWho am I comm conferencing with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSelenka Durev in Moscow.\u201d The two packs had an informal arrangement to share information, and this was a \u201ctouching base\u201d kind of a chat. \u201cYou know how quick-tempered she is\u2014she might take it as an insult if you\u2019re late.\u201d A kiss to his nape. \u201cI\u2019ll turn on the shower.\u201d As she got out of bed and did so, she realized she was smiling. No matter his mood, there was no man she\u2019d rather wake to find next to her.</p><p>When he walked into the shower and asked her to remind him of the points he was meant to go over during the comm-conference, she felt the tie between them grow deeper, more nuanced. He hadn\u2019t asked her because she was a novice soldier. He\u2019d asked her because she was his mate, and he needed the reminder. Just as he\u2019d allowed her to see him hungover. A simple thing, a small vulnerability, but it meant everything coming from an alpha wolf.</p><p>IT was a terrifyingly happy week after that interlude by the pool that Adria found herself toe-to-toe with Riaz. \u201cDon\u2019t give me an ultimatum.\u201d Martin had thrown too many of those at her during their years together, until even the hint of one made rage erupt in her bloodstream.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an ultimatum,\u201d Riaz said, his tone a silky threat. \u201cIt\u2019s a warning. I\u2019ve let the issue of shared quarters slide a hell of a lot longer than I should have. You\u2019re mine. You live with me. End of story.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf bristled. \u201cIt\u2019s not an inevitability.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t as if they ever slept apart.</p><p>\u201cFuck that. If I wanted to live alone, I wouldn\u2019t be in a relationship.\u201d Twisting her braid in his hand, he held her in place. \u201cSo your thinking time has just run out.\u201d</p><p>She dug her claws into his chest, saw him wince. \u201cLet go or I\u2019ll rip this T-shirt, too.\u201d</p><p>Respect on his face. \u201cI\u2019ll let go ... after this.\u201d The kiss was hot and angry and refused to allow her any distance.</p><p>She was still growling in fury when she ran into Indigo not long afterward. \u201cDon\u2019t ask,\u201d she snapped the instant the other woman went to open her mouth. \u201cNot when I saw you making kissy faces with Drew five seconds ago.\u201d</p><p>Indigo held up her hands in surrender. \u201cHey, we fight. Drew just makes it damn hard to stay mad at him. Do you know what he did today?\u201d She answered her question before Adria could respond. \u201cHe lined the dashboard of my vehicle with miniature teddy bears with sad faces. I mean, come on! Not fair.\u201d</p><p>Adria laughed despite herself\u2014because Indigo was holding one of those adorable tiny bears as she gesticulated. \u201cYou have it so tough, boo-hoo.\u201d</p><p>Indigo mimed throwing the soft toy at her. \u201cSee? I never get any sympathy.\u201d Tucking the bear into her jeans pocket, where it watched them mournfully, she said, \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>Adria shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m going for a run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she muttered. \u201cI want to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet over it. You\u2019re in a pack.\u201d</p><p>They ran in silence for over half an hour, ending up on a high mountain meadow dotted with wildflowers and huge broken rocks thrown around as if by a giant\u2019s hands. Taking a seat on one of those rocks after quenching her thirst at a fragile waterfall hidden nearby, she said, \u201cSorry for being snippy.\u201d</p><p>Indigo, seated on the ground with her back to the sun-warmed rock, reached over to pat her on the shin. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed. What did Riaz do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s demanding I move in with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHardly surprising,\u201d Indigo said, stretching out her legs. \u201cHe\u2019s a wolf. Pack is everything, and his woman is where it begins.\u201d</p><p>Those words again\u2014his woman. \u201cI made the decision to be with him,\u201d Adria whispered, \u201cbut I never thought I\u2019d fall so hard, so deep, until his name is written on parts of me Martin never touched.\u201d It was the first time she\u2019d consciously accepted that fact ... and the fear that came with the knowledge. Martin had hurt her, but Riaz, he could savage her. \u201cHe does these things and they take my breath away, make my chest hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of things?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYesterday, he disappeared with my boots and came back with them resoled because he\u2019d noticed they were damaged.\u201d When she\u2019d thanked him, he\u2019d run his knuckles down her cheek and said it was his job to care for her. \u201cI found a shawl in my quarters the other day, soft as air, and the precise color of my eyes.\u201d Golden threads woven into the exquisite blue.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s always feeding me,\u201d she said, bewildered by the unexpected tenderness. \u201cCupcakes and homemade pizza and my favorite spaghetti.\u201d Then there was the most wonderful thing of all\u2014the wooden sculptures she kept finding in her pockets. Her favorite was a tiny dragon, its expression fierce, its claws out.</p><p>\u201cProtectiveness is part of the package,\u201d Indigo said. \u201cYou know that. I\u2019m more dominant than Drew, but he still finds ways to take care of me.\u201d She took the sad bear out, smiled, and kissed its face before tucking it safely back into her pocket.</p> <p>\u201cI know. I just never expected Riaz to be like that with me.\u201d She didn\u2019t have to explain why, didn\u2019t want to speak of the unknown woman who was Riaz\u2019s mate.</p><p>Twisting, Indigo looked up at her. \u201cI get why you\u2019re hesitant. I guess the question is, do you think you\u2019d be happier without him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bear to think of being without him.\u201d The hurt was bone deep ... and that was her answer.</p><p>Coming down to sit beside Indigo, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s no use trying to keep a physical distance between us, is there? When I already belong to him here.\u201d She rubbed a fisted hand over her heart, knowing that regardless of how much it terrified her to trust her love to a man whose own would never belong to her, keeping it stifled did an injustice both to herself and to the lone wolf who had made her feel so cherished. \u201cI have to have the courage to love him without conditions.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 52</p> <p>VASQUEZ WENT OVER the most recent report cataloguing the acts of attempted sabotage on SnowDancer land. The incidents had dropped off markedly in the past two weeks, and none had caused the wolves any problems, but planning and carrying them out was keeping the majority of Pure Psy\u2019s remaining forces occupied.</p><p>Good, he thought, sending a telepathic message to the ringleader to continue. So long as they were occupied in the pointless task, he could set up the warning \u201coutlier\u201d strike without having to concern himself with anyone getting too curious. No leaks could be permitted. Not now.</p><p>Not when the time had finally come.</p><p>\u201cThere is one problem,\u201d he said to Henry when they met that night. \u201cThough I have a unit ready to move on the secondary targets, I still have only one operative I trust with the primary task.\u201d Making back-to-back strikes impossible, though\u2014and not counting the outlier\u2014he had five complete sets of confirmed locations. \u201cHowever, I do not recommend waiting. The Net is becoming further infected with those whose conditioning has fractured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have permission to move as soon as you see an open window,\u201d Henry replied, his broken voice short of breath. \u201cWe will succeed, Vasquez.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. We will.\u201d No one and nothing had the power to stop them. Not this time.</p> <p>Chapter 53</p><p>TWO DAYS AFTER Adria moved in with him, Riaz was a happy wolf. He loved having her in his space, loved that her scent was everywhere\u2014and that his was all over every perfect inch of her. And he was definitely smug about the fact that though their request for quarters in the couples section hadn\u2019t yet gone through, she hadn\u2019t made any noises about his room being too small for the both of them.</p><p>Wiping the smile off his face since it totally destroyed his hard-ass rep, he put through a call to Bowen, needing to talk through some final details about SnowDancer\u2019s permanent liaison arrangement with the Alliance. The security chief asked him to organize clearance for the liaison to fly to San Francisco for a sit-down discussion within the next few days. \u201cI think I have the perfect candidate, but I want to discuss her with Lily. She\u2019s taken over Human Resources, knows our people inside out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d Switching lines, Riaz made a quick call to his counterpart in DarkRiver\u2014Nathan\u2014and got the clearance, the city very much leopard territory. Back on the line with Bo, he said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got permission,\u201d then set out the conditions\u2014basically dealing with how much freedom of movement the liaison would be permitted. \u201cYou coming along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try. Depends on the security situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny further aggression from Tatiana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing obvious. Covert surveillance is likely.\u201d A beep in the background. \u201cThat\u2019s my cell phone. I better get it\u2014link up with you later in the week to confirm flight details.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up, Riaz swung by Indigo\u2019s office to discuss a personnel matter. The other lieutenant gave him a considering look across her desk after they were done. \u201cAdria told me about the rose petals.\u201d</p> <p>He knew when a wolf was fishing. \u201cDid she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it. She mentioned rose petals and then she blushed. Adria never blushes.\u201d</p><p>Sprawled in her visitor chair, he just smiled. \u201cSo, you and Drew are heading to take over Alexei\u2019s sector in a month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly caretaking,\u201d Indigo clarified. \u201cYou know how good he is. Needs a bit more seasoning is all. I\u2019m taking most of my novices and younger soldiers along,\u201d she added. \u201cGood for them to learn to work with dominants from other sectors. The ones I\u2019m leaving here are those with an aptitude for weapons\u2014Alexei\u2019s going to do sessions with them while he\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Knowing Alexei\u2019s strength in that area, Riaz knew the novices had lucked out. \u201cHe had any more problems with challenges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but there has been an interesting development as of last night\u2014the wolves in the pack that kept challenging him?\u201d At Riaz\u2019s nod, she continued. \u201cTurns out they\u2019re in a bad way. Their alpha passed two months ago from old age, and while the lieutenants were able to keep it quiet and hold the pack together, they\u2019re all comparatively young and weak.\u201d</p><p>In a situation where a pack had no successor to their alpha, Riaz thought, a strong lieutenant who had the backing of his fellow dominants could ensure the pack\u2019s continued health. But it needed to be someone of Riley\u2019s caliber\u2014a man every wolf in the pack could respect and whose strength was unquestioned.</p><p>Without that, the natural aggression of the dominants would spill over, disintegrating the pack from the inside out. \u201cIs that why all the challenges?\u201d he said, seeing the weaker pack\u2019s plan\u2014a clever one, if only they\u2019d had someone who could take Alexei. \u201cThey wanted one of their people in a position of power in SnowDancer?\u201d</p><p>Indigo nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re desperate to merge with us, but it\u2019s a tough ask for them to bring in their people under someone they don\u2019t know and trust. Especially given our reputation.\u201d</p><p>A reputation that, Riaz knew, had been carefully cultivated in the years after Hawke took over as alpha. No one else, that young boy had declared, would ever see SnowDancer as easy prey. Each and every dominant in the den had backed that reputation up with teeth and claws and blood, until even the most aggressive packs steered clear of SnowDancer territory. \u201cAlexei\u2019s show got their attention,\u201d he guessed.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014and since pretty much every dominant in their pack was there when he returned their man, they had a chance to judge him for themselves. They\u2019ve made a formal request to be permitted to move in under SnowDancer\u2019s banner, bringing their territorial lands with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis pack know what that means?\u201d SnowDancer expected total and absolute loyalty, had executed one of their own not long ago when he proved a murderous traitor.</p><p>\u201cThey will\u2014and if it goes through, our region swap might have to wait a bit while our new packmates get settled in under Alexei.\u201d Indigo glanced at her watch. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to leave for the meet. Make sure the octopus doesn\u2019t get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d he muttered, but part of him was intrigued by the idea of changeling octopuses. Or should that be \u201coctopi\u201d? BlackSea was so secretive, it was impossible to separate wild conjecture from fact.</p><p>Hawke and Riley met him in the garage. The three of them\u2014and Kenji\u2014had debated dressing in suits, but had settled on their usual jeans and T-shirts. This was who they were, and if BlackSea didn\u2019t like it, there wasn\u2019t much hope for a functional alliance.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to drive?\u201d Riaz asked, reaching the vehicle.</p><p>They all looked at one another ... then stuck out their fists for a game of rock, paper, scissors. Riley won, with Riaz losing and ending up in the backseat. In a good mood, he wasn\u2019t fussed, his mind filled with thoughts of the woman who had brought him back to life, branded her claim on his heart. His tough, prickly, generous Adria, who wasn\u2019t so tough or prickly after all.</p><p>Last night, he\u2019d had her in giggling fits after finding a ticklish spot and taking merciless advantage. He\u2019d felt as young as a pup as they twisted and tangled in the sheets, her giggles erupting between stern admonitions and breathless threats. Wolf grinning at the memory, he talked to the back of Riley\u2019s head. \u201cHow\u2019s Mercy doing?\u201d</p><p>The senior sentinel caressed the steering wheel through a turn, sliding the vehicle gracefully onto the highway beyond den territory. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t snarled at me yet.\u201d Pure disbelief in every syllable. \u201cI turn up out of the blue while she\u2019s working, and she smiles, gives me a kiss, and lets me hang around as long as I want.\u201d</p><p>Hawke turned to look at Riley, suspicion writ large on his profile. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about Mercy the sentinel? The one who\u2019d kick your ass if you dared baby her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the pregnancy?\u201d Riley sounded hopeful.</p><p>Riaz winced. \u201cPregnancy usually makes dominant females meaner, not nicer.\u201d It tended to take very careful petting to calm one down once she got her fur ruffled. \u201cAre you sure she\u2019s happy to see you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Riley gave him a look in the rearview mirror.</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Riaz muttered. \u201cMating bond.\u201d The scar inside him stretched, the wound throbbing, but it didn\u2019t bleed. Because the thing was, he knew when his empress was happy, too, his wolf attuned to her own.</p><p>Hawke rubbed his jaw. \u201cI\u2019d say enjoy it while it lasts,\u201d was his thoughtful advice. \u201cSooner or later, she\u2019ll turn into a she-demon.\u201d</p> <p>Riley\u2019s growl filled the vehicle. \u201cDon\u2019t insult my mate or I\u2019ll have to stop this SUV and beat you dead.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s hair caught the light coming through the open sunroof as he shook his head, the strands gleaming white-gold. \u201cI can take you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the meeting, you and me. Riaz will referee.\u201d</p><p>Well aware the two men were the best of friends and often took each other on in combat, Riaz interlocked his fingers behind his head and looked up at the clear blue sky visible through the sunroof. \u201cDolphin changelings\u2014what do you think?\u201d</p> <p>Riley was the one who replied. \u201cThat one, I could give credence to. Any number of humans and nonwater-based changelings\u2014even Psy in some cases\u2014report being saved from drowning by dolphins. The survivors always mention how intelligent the creatures seemed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d Hawke said, \u201cassumes humans, changelings, and Psy are the only intelligent species on the planet. Pretty arrogant of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJellyfish,\u201d Riaz said, after considering the other inhabitants of the sea. \u201cSeriously, there cannot be jellyfish changelings.\u201d</p><p>Hawke turned to look over his shoulder. \u201cWhat the hell have you been smoking?\u201d</p><p>Riaz shrugged, his mood undampened. \u201cIt was green and leafy.\u201d He made a note to discuss the subject of possible sea changelings with Adria\u2014intrigued as she was by puzzles, she\u2019d find it as fascinating as he did. \u201cThere\u2019s Kenji.\u201d His flight delayed, the lieutenant had asked them to swing by the airport and pick him up.</p><p>Jumping in sans luggage, Kenji and his magenta hair took a seat beside Riaz. \u201cA teenage girl screamed and asked for my autograph\u2014thought I was part of some boy band from Japan.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told you so,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cDid you give your fan an autograph?\u201d</p><p>Kenji grinned. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been such a shame to disappoint her.\u201d</p><p>The rest of the drive was taken up with a quick discussion about the upcoming meeting, which Hawke would lead, the rest of them providing backup and security as needed.</p><p>Riaz tapped Riley\u2019s shoulder when they hit the Embarcadero, pointing left. \u201cThat building.\u201d Squat and wide, it fronted the pier, the shimmer of the Bay visible in the small gap between the warehouse and the fence.</p><p>Parking, they got out to find Nathan waiting for them. The senior DarkRiver sentinel took them through the empty space Riaz had already checked out with him earlier in the week. Nate went over all the exits and entrances once again, as well as anything that could be a possible blind spot in a fight. Because of its shape, the warehouse didn\u2019t really possess any shadowy corners, part of the reason Riaz had chosen it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve disabled the surveillance equipment as you asked,\u201d Nate said to Riaz, \u201cbut one of the techs is standing by if you want anything functional.\u201d</p><p>Hawke shook his head, crossing the cavernous space to slide open the wide door that led out onto the pier. \u201cNo, we\u2019ll lose their trust if they figure out they\u2019re being monitored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, the place is all yours. Call me once you\u2019re done and I\u2019ll send someone to lock it up. Good luck.\u201d The DarkRiver sentinel left with those words.</p> <p>Riaz and Kenji followed Riley and Hawke out onto the pier. Seagulls cawed overhead, the scent of brine and fish pungent in Riaz\u2019s nostrils, the wind rifling through his hair. Taking a deep breath, he scoped the area one more time. While it allowed easy access to and from the Bay, once on the pier, their guests would be blocked from the view of the other warehouses by the high fences on both sides.</p><p>Given BlackSea\u2019s preference to stay under the radar, he and Nate had even rigged up a temporary boathouse, ensuring Miane\u2019s group could go straight from their boat to the pier. Nate had suggested BlackSea might simply swim in, but Riaz didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be anything but besuited, polished professionals.</p><p>He was proven right.</p><p>\u201cHere they come.\u201d The sleek craft cut through the water with the grace of a dancer, its engine near silent. Unsurprising\u2014BlackSea\u2019s shipbuilding arm was considered to be peerless, its craftsmen and craftswomen artists.</p><p>The vessel slipped into the temporary boathouse and docked. And then Miane Lev\u00e8que was stepping onto the pier with two unfamiliar men and Emani. Dressed in a neat skirt suit of deep green, Miane was a woman of medium height with translucent hazel eyes uptilted a fraction at the corners and stick-straight hair of ebony, the black too soft to be called jet.</p><p>That hair was cut into a blunt fringe above her eyes, throwing them into sharp relief. Her skin was a shade that placed her ancestry in Northern Africa or the Middle East, or possibly part of South America. Riaz didn\u2019t have to guess\u2014he\u2019d done his research, knew she\u2019d been born in the port of Cairo to an Algerian mother and an Egyptian father.</p><p>\u201cHawke.\u201d She held out a hand that bore scars from more than a few nicks and cuts, though her nails were manicured and polished a glossy shade Riaz thought might be called oyster.</p><p>Hawke shook it, holding her cool, almost cold gaze. Riley introduced himself a second later, giving Miane a reason to look away. It was an almost ritualistic dance when two alphas met for the first time. Left to their own devices, they\u2019d stare until one of them either backed down or drew first blood.</p><p>Riaz remained in the background with Kenji, his attention on the men who\u2019d come with the BlackSea alpha, both clearly there for her protection, regardless of any status they held in the Conclave. That wasn\u2019t an insult\u2014he and the other lieutenants were here for Hawke\u2019s protection. None of them would drop their guard at any time, in case this was a giant double-cross and BlackSea was aiming for the assassination of the most powerful alpha in the country.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Miane said, taking a small step back, her feet encased in black leather-synth heels that made a clipping sound on the plascrete, \u201cjoin me on my vessel. The stateroom is more than adequate for this meeting.\u201d</p><p>A gracious offer meant to put them off their game, their wolves having a strong dislike for the motion of the sea. They could bear it, but it would fray tempers, reduce concentration.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I\u2019ll decline.\u201d Hawke bared his teeth in a smile that was a silent warning. \u201cIf you prefer not to enter the warehouse, we can talk here.\u201d</p><p>Miane considered it, one of her men whispering in her ear at a sub-vocal level. \u201cMalachai says it will be easier to spy on us outdoors, use audio equipment to pick up our voices. The most secure place would be out at sea.\u201d</p><p>Hawke just waited. He\u2019d made his intentions clear, and now it was up to Miane to accept or walk away. After a tense pause and another muted discussion with the hard-eyed male named Malachai, the leader of the BlackSea Conclave inclined her head, and Riaz knew she\u2019d decided to trust them this much at least. \u201cLet\u2019s proceed inside.\u201d</p><p>Riaz left the doors open behind them. Intercepting a glance from Emani, he said, \u201cWe can use audio disrupters to make certain the conversation remains private,\u201d and produced the small, round devices from a flat case in the back pocket of his jeans.</p><p>Emani checked the disrupters with a handheld scanner and nodded. Together, they set out and activated four of them, one in each corner of the warehouse. No one spoke until they\u2019d returned to stand behind their respective alphas.</p><p>\u201cWe,\u201d Miane said, \u201chave been pleased with SnowDancer\u2019s willingness to work with us on an agreement.\u201d</p><p>Hawke watched her without blinking. \u201cLet\u2019s cut to the chase\u2014the only remaining questions are whether we can work together on the ground, and the real reason why you\u2019re suddenly so keen on an alliance.\u201d</p><p>A slight widening of her eyes was the sole indication of Miane\u2019s surprise. \u201cBlunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe worked with you on the contract because it made sense with your people being so spread out,\u201d Hawke said, \u201cbut that\u2019s not who we are, and that\u2019s not how we function. Better you know that now than be surprised by it later.\u201d</p><p>A faint hint of warmth in the cold intelligence of Miane\u2019s eyes. \u201cDid you know that changeling sharks are so rare,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019re considered a myth even by some of the changelings in BlackSea?\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s responding smile was razor sharp. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t believe the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs to that, I\u2019ll keep my own counsel, but I will say I understand predators.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 54</p><p>HAVING BEEN ASSIGNED to a shift at the infirmary at the last minute, Adria lifted a questioning eyebrow at Elias when he joined her. \u201cLast I checked,\u201d she said, \u201cwe didn\u2019t have any dangerous criminals in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re hoping to wake Alice Eldridge.\u201d Elias kept his voice low. \u201cHawke wants extra security until Lara can get a read on her while she\u2019s conscious\u2014there\u2019s no way to know what she was programmed to do before being put to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Shifting slightly, Adria glanced into the patient room. While access to Alice was strictly controlled, Adria had seen the comatose woman in the aftermath of the battle, when she\u2019d helped move Alice\u2019s bed to the side to make room for injured SnowDancers. Alice lay as she had done then, ashen and motionless. Around her stood three women, each with a frown of concentration on her face, their voices overlapping as they talked over last-minute adjustments.</p><p>Lara, Adria knew and respected. Ashaya Aleine, too, was familiar after that dinner at Mercy and Riley\u2019s, her tight curls pulled severely off her face into a neat bun, her blue-gray eyes startling against the rich brown of her skin. The third woman, with her soft curves, honey-toned skin, and cardinal eyes, was no one Adria had ever spoken to, but recognized nonetheless. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sascha Duncan, mate to the DarkRiver alpha, an E-Psy.</p><p>Adria\u2019s wolf wasn\u2019t quite comfortable being around a woman who could sense its emotions\u2014especially when those emotions were so painfully deep and complex. Living with Riaz, it was nothing like living with Martin. The man was dominant and pushy and arrogant enough to want his own way, but he was also perverse enough to be delighted with her when she snarled at him.</p><p>The thought made her lips twitch for a fleeting second, before darker emotions rose to the fore. In spite of the realization she\u2019d had on the wildflower-strewn meadow in the mountains, a desperate kernel of self-preservation kept warning her to keep a piece of herself separate, apart. Not to hurt him ... but because she wasn\u2019t Riaz\u2019s mate, never would be, their relationship unbalanced on the most fundamental level.</p> <p>PERIPHERALLY aware of Eli and Adria in the doorway, Lara glanced at Ashaya. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>The scientist nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve done as much as possible without injecting her.\u201d</p><p>Conscious the M-Psy was profoundly concerned about the damage they might cause, Lara said, \u201cIf we do nothing, she\u2019ll die. Her body is failing.\u201d</p><p>Ashaya\u2019s head snapped up from the panel at the end of the bed. \u201cI told you to warn us if she went downhill. We could\u2019ve moved faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spoke to Amara,\u201d Lara said, thinking of the woman who was physically identical to Ashaya, but so very alien in her thinking. \u201cShe told me that if we injected Alice with the uncalibrated serum, the risk of failure rose by seventy percent. I made the decision to wait.\u201d</p> <p>Ashaya gripped the top of the panel, her bones pushing white against her skin. \u201cMy twin has a way of being right while hiding things, Lara. You know that. You should\u2019ve double-checked with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to distract you at such a critical stage.\u201d Ashaya herself had told Lara the final calibration would take precision work\u2014so much so that the scientist had spent two days away from her mate and son, in the dedicated lab DarkRiver had built for her.</p><p>\u201cNo harm done\u2014the serum wasn\u2019t ready.\u201d Ashaya went as if to shove a hand through her curls, realized they were bound, and dropped it back on the bed. \u201cFor future reference, though, my twin is very, very smart, but she has no moral compass.\u201d</p><p>Sascha made a small sound in the back of her throat. \u201cI didn\u2019t like Amara when I met her,\u201d she said, clearly still troubled by what she\u2019d described to Lara as an overwhelmingly hostile response. \u201cEven now, she sends a chill through my bones because of the lack in her, but that lack isn\u2019t as total as it once was. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever be capable of the normal range of emotions, but she may be showing a stunted kind of awareness of the emotions of others.\u201d</p><p>Ashaya\u2019s face held painful hope. \u201cYou\u2019re not certain, though?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Sascha touched the other woman on the arm. \u201cI have such a strong reaction to her that I find it difficult to get a clear read, and as you said, her intelligence is unquestioned. She\u2019s fully capable of manipulating her responses.\u201d</p> <p>Smart enough, Lara thought, to fake empathy.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Sascha added, \u201cthere has been a change in her, that much I can verify. It might simply be the effect of being in a clean psychic network\u2014there\u2019s no DarkMind in the Web of Stars, no hidden miasma that\u2019s seeping into her brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that.\u201d Swallowing, Ashaya returned her attention to the computronic readout on the panel in front of her. \u201cUnless either of you disagrees, I think it\u2019s time we spoke to Alice.\u201d</p><p>Lara and Sascha both nodded at her to go ahead.</p><p>Pressure injector in hand, the scientist looked to where Sascha\u2019s fingers now intertwined with Alice\u2019s. \u201cAre you sensing anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrustration again,\u201d Sascha said, three deep vertical lines between her eyebrows. \u201cBut there\u2019s something else.\u201d Lashes lowering, she squeezed the bridge of her nose between the thumb and forefinger of her free hand. \u201cDetermination.\u201d Her eyes flicked open. \u201cI\u2019d bet my life she\u2019s trying her hardest to wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough for me.\u201d With no more hesitation, Ashaya pressed the pressure injector to Alice\u2019s neck, punching the serum into her bloodstream. \u201cThe effect should be apparent within two or three minutes if it works as it\u2019s supposed to.\u201d</p><p>No one said a word, the silence so pristine Lara could hear the hushed breaths of everyone in the immediate area, including Eli and Adria. If the room had boasted an old-fashioned ticking clock, she thought, every tick would\u2019ve sounded like a bomb.</p> <p>One minute.</p><p>Checking the data coming in through Alice\u2019s computronic skullcap, Lara shook her head at the others.</p><p>Two minutes.</p><p>It was Ashaya who checked this time, her fingers flying over the panel. \u201cNo change.\u201d</p><p>Three minutes.</p><p>Four.</p><p>Five.</p><p>Disappointment a heavy rock on her chest, Lara squeezed Ashaya\u2019s arm in silent sympathy, and they walked to stand across from Sascha. However, the cardinal empath paid them no attention, her eyes gone a midnight that denoted either strong emotion\u2014or a powerful use of her abilities.</p><p>Exchanging a taut, hopeful glance with Ashaya, Lara maintained her silence.</p><p>\u201cAshaya,\u201d Sascha said almost half a minute later, her voice muted, as if her attention was elsewhere, \u201cdo you have more of the serum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but a second shot could kill her.\u201d Ashaya fiddled with the settings on the injector, paused for a second. \u201cAmara\u2019s confident we can safely give her another eighth of a dose.\u201d</p><p>Recalling the other woman\u2019s earlier warnings, Lara turned to her. \u201cYou trust her on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is a challenge.\u201d Ashaya\u2019s answer held a clarity that said she saw her twin\u2019s faults and flaws as well as her gifts. \u201cAmara doesn\u2019t like failing, and Alice\u2019s death would constitute failure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can feel her struggling,\u201d Sascha said, her fingers now locked so tightly with Alice\u2019s that the warm honey of her skin was bloodless. \u201cShe knows she\u2019s trapped\u2014there\u2019s panic, fear. God, it\u2019s like she\u2019s suffocating from the terror of being entombed inside her own body.\u201d</p><p>Clearly shaken by the report, Ashaya put the injector to Alice\u2019s neck. \u201cAre you sure, Sascha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>A press of Ashaya\u2019s thumb and a one-eighth part of the serum blasted through the permeable barrier of Alice\u2019s skin.</p><p>Alarms blared a second later, Alice\u2019s body arching so severely off the bed that she almost bent herself in half before falling back onto the sheets in a jagged spasm. Scanning the alarms, Lara grabbed the oxygen mask and placed it over Alice\u2019s mouth and nose. \u201cAshaya, stats!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRapid spike in her mental activity. Irregular heartbeat, insufficient oxygen being absorbed.\u201d</p><p>Slapping Sascha\u2019s hand over the oxygen mask to keep it in place, Lara reached for another injector and pressed it to Alice\u2019s upper arm. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeartbeat is stabilizing.\u201d Ashaya tapped the screen. \u201cOxygen levels reaching optimum. Brain activity continues to be erratic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlice,\u201d Sascha\u2019s gentle voice turned somehow ruthless, it was so intent. \u201cAlice, you\u2019re safe. Focus.\u201d</p><p>That was when Lara looked down and realized that Alice Eldridge\u2019s eyes, so rich a brown that pupil and iris were near impossible to differentiate, were wide open.</p><p>HAVING returned from the meeting with BlackSea to be told the news about Alice Eldridge, Riaz spent several minutes talking with Ashaya and Hawke. It wasn\u2019t simply about the human woman that they spoke.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been focused on Alice,\u201d Ashaya said, \u201cbut what I\u2019ve studied so far of the Alliance chip hasn\u2019t raised any red flags. However, that\u2019s not saying much\u2014I\u2019ll begin intensive work on it as soon as Alice is stable.\u201d</p><p>Waiting until after the scientist had returned to the infirmary, Hawke said, \u201cWhen\u2019s Bo getting back to you about his liaison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext few days.\u201d Riaz folded his arms. \u201cWhat do you think about the BlackSea situation?\u201d The secretive changeling group had finally shared why it was they needed SnowDancer as an ally.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s expression was grim. \u201cThey\u2019re a valuable group to have as friends. We help them as much as we can\u2014Miane knows I won\u2019t do anything that\u2019d leave SnowDancer vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>Riaz had had the same thoughts. \u201cDo you want me to set up another meeting to finalize the alliance?\u201d</p><p>Hawke took a second to think about it, shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ll talk directly to Miane, make sure there are no misunderstandings. Can you take some of Riley\u2019s load? I figure he\u2019s earned a rest ... and some spare time to stalk Mercy.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cNot a problem.\u201d As a result of arranging things with Riley, as well as staying late to take several calls from the men and women in SnowDancer\u2019s international network, Riaz didn\u2019t get a chance to speak to Adria until after nightfall. Unable to find her in the den, he shifted and began to check out her favorite spots in the forests one by one.</p><p>He found her at the third location, the full moon a spotlight across the large clearing dotted with young saplings that had come up after a storm felled many of the mature trees a couple of years back. Silhouetted against the midnight blue of the night sky, their slender profiles added a haunting beauty to the scene.</p><p>And there was his empress walking through the saplings, her head lowered in thought.</p><p>He watched for a long, motionless moment, his hunger satisfied now that he\u2019d found her. She was magnificent. Strong and lithe and lovely. And his. Even if she wasn\u2019t quite certain she wanted to be\u2014Adria thought he didn\u2019t know about the apprehension that haunted her, but of course he knew. He noticed everything about her.</p><p>He\u2019d been patient, but it was time she accepted he wasn\u2019t ever letting her go. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>ADRIA caught the woodsmoke and citrus of Riaz\u2019s scent on the breeze, but it took her several seconds to locate him\u2014in the end, it was those golden eyes that gave him away. If he closed them, he\u2019d be a black shadow in the dark. When he brushed himself against her legs, she ran her fingers through his fur. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t shift into human form, just pressed more heavily against her in silent demand. Comprehending, she continued to stroke him, his wolf more than big enough to reach halfway up her thigh. When he looked up, caught her gaze with the night-glow brightness of his own, she felt her heart stutter, kick-start in a faster rhythm.</p><p>That look, it was of the hunter.</p> <p>And she knew this silent dance between them would be decided tonight, one way or the other. Either she tore down every one of her defenses and accepted his claim to the soul, or she walked away. Except she didn\u2019t think the latter was an option.</p><p>Nerves and anger collided.</p><p>He was pushing her, but of course he would. That was who he was. Like she was a dominant who knew her own strength. Breaking contact, she shifted, not bothering to strip. Her clothes disintegrated off her as the agony and ecstasy of the change took over, sparks of light blazing in the lush mystery that was the night.</p><p>A heartbeat later, she stood on four feet, her head angled toward the black wolf who was so much bigger and stronger, but who she knew would never cause her physical harm. That knowledge, it was enough for the wolf, but the woman needed more, needed the devotion she knew he would offer only one woman his entire lifetime.</p><p>He nuzzled at her, but she danced away, racing through the willowy shadows of the trees and across the silent music of a moon-silvered stream. He was fast, so fast, but she was clever, and she tangled and twisted around trees young and old, over jagged rocks and across sleepy flowers to cross another stream, splashing downstream to conceal her scent before coming up on the other shore.</p> <p>The black wolf was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t fooled, knew he was stalking her. Padding quietly along the verge, she kept her eyes on the other side of the stream ... and caught a glimpse of feral gold. He lunged across the water, but she was already racing to put distance between them, squeezing through gaps he wouldn\u2019t fit, skating under fallen trees that wouldn\u2019t accommodate his size.</p><p>The next time she halted, her heart thumped a pounding beat, the wolf\u2019s exhilaration mixing with the woman\u2019s. The air was a treasure trove of scents, the night full of song. It intoxicated. Knowing she needed to think with a clearer head, she shifted back into human form, her hair tumbling around her as she crouched on the forest floor, her head angled to the wind.</p><p>Dark, of the forest, kissed with woodsmoke and a wild bite of citrus.</p><p>All around her. In her skin. Against her tongue.</p><p>His lips smoothed over her neck, his hand gentle on her hip, but she knew she was caught. Turning, she watched him with the wolf\u2019s eyes. His own hair fell over his face, his gaze luminous. This time, those eyes said, he wouldn\u2019t let her run. But she wasn\u2019t a wolf because she gave up. She twisted to the left without warning.</p> <p>He was there almost before she moved, taking her body to the earth. She shivered at the cool kiss of the dew-laden grass, but he didn\u2019t let her up. \u201cI have you.\u201d His voice was gravelly, dark with the determination of the predator inside him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m keeping you.\u201d</p><p>She lifted a hand to his cheek, the tenderness within her an endless river. How could she have ever thought to keep any part of her heart safe from him? It was an impossibility. She was caught, well and truly. Tears burned her eyes, trickled down the sides of her face and into her hair.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He kissed the salt-laced sadness away, rolling onto his back and taking her with him, one hand cradling the back of her head, the other stroking down the curve of her spine. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>His gentleness twined another tendril around her heart, until she was so entangled in him, she knew she\u2019d never break free. For the first time in her life, her wolf had chosen. And it had chosen this lone wolf. \u201cYou have me,\u201d she whispered. All of me.</p><p>Chapter 55</p><p>KALEB WAS AT his home office when Silver called. \u201cA. V. is Vasquez,\u201d she said, \u201cof that my family is as certain as we can be without having his DNA. He also appears to be running things as far as Pure Psy is concerned. However, the rank and file believe he speaks for Henry.\u201d</p><p>So did Kaleb. The NetMind and DarkMind both had had too calm a reaction to Henry\u2019s \u201cdeath.\u201d Kaleb had attempted to use the twin neosentience to track the former Councilor, but they had been acting increasingly erratic of late, and he\u2019d been unable to focus them on the target. That bespoke a profound problem in the Net, the depth of which perhaps he alone understood\u2014Henry\u2019s fanaticism and the continued deterioration of Subject 8-91 were simply symptoms of a more dangerous malaise.</p><p>Concluding the conversation with his aide, he rose from his desk, playing a small platinum star through his fingers. The metal was warm from his touch, but his mind worked with ice-cold precision as he decided what was to be done with Henry. Aden.</p> <p>The telepath\u2019s reply was crystal clear. Councilor.</p><p>Kaleb will do. The Council is no longer in existence except in the minds of the populace.</p><p>Kaleb.</p><p>Henry will continue to be a problem if he lives. Do you have any issue with eliminating him? Kaleb needed to know how much of the Arrows\u2019 loyalty was his.</p><p>No. His policies are not good for the Net.</p><p>Kaleb rubbed his thumb over the shining surface of the star. Then regard it as an authorized mission.</p><p>Noted.</p><p>Telepathic connection severed, Kaleb considered those who\u2019d remain after Henry\u2019s demise. Shoshanna, he didn\u2019t waste time on. Henry\u2019s \u201cwife\u201d had flaws that would make it easy to manipulate her. Nikita would leave Kaleb alone so long as he didn\u2019t attempt to violate her territory\u2014or harm her child and grandchild. The other Councilor hid it well, but Kaleb could glide through the Net without causing a single ripple. He saw everything. Nikita\u2019s conditioning might be flawless, but she wasn\u2019t Silent.</p><p>Not in the way he was.</p><p>Nikita\u2019s protective instinct was her Achilles\u2019 heel, but Kaleb had no reason to exploit it. Not as long as she didn\u2019t attempt to get in his way. If she did...</p><p>His eye fell on the star. He halted his movements. And knew he had his own weakness, one Nikita would never guess at, and so he still had the advantage in his dealings with her.</p><p>As for Anthony, Kaleb didn\u2019t think there would be any problems\u2014he had no desire to encroach on NightStar lands or capture Anthony\u2019s stable of F-Psy. No foreseer could stop him once he\u2019d decided on a course of action.</p><p>That left Ming and Tatiana. Both would have to die when it was time. There was no other viable option. Kaleb would not chance them coming at him from behind.</p><p>The star sparked in the light from the lamp on his desk.</p><p>Caught, he stared at the small charm, wondering what its owner would make of his thoughts of assassination. Soon, he would discover the answer. Because he\u2019d just breached another layer of security, unearthed the oldest part of the trail. It was fragile and fragmented, but it was there.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>Chapter 56</p><p>RIAZ CALLED ADRIA to ask her to come along to the meeting with Bo and the liaison three days later and discovered that she was already in San Francisco with Indigo, Tarah, Evie, and another woman who had a familiar scent but looked nothing like she should\u2014from her height, to the color of her hair and eyes, even the shape of her face, the latter apparently altered using high-tech gel pads Judd had procured from who knows where.</p><p>As he pulled away after picking up Adria, the other four women waved at him from the caf\u00e9 where they were eating large pieces of cake slathered in frosting. \u201cHow in hell did Sienna talk Hawke into letting her out of den territory?\u201d</p><p>Adria gave him an arch look. \u201cI have no idea. Didn\u2019t ask.\u201d Scooping up a bite of the apple pie she\u2019d had packed to go, she fed it to him. \u201cHowever, she may possibly have pointed out that she\u2019s an adult female with the right to make up her own mind.\u201d</p><p>He bit back a grin at her tone. \u201cYes, she may have done that, but Hawke is newly mated and there\u2019s a high probability she\u2019s in Ming\u2019s crosshairs. Hawke might be intelligent, but he\u2019s not that rational, not when it comes to Sienna.\u201d</p><p>Eating a bite of pie herself, Adria made a \u201chmming\u201d sound in her throat. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re right. Though, until you picked me up, she was with a lieutenant, a senior soldier, and a woman who thinks of her as another daughter. No one was going to get to her.\u201d</p><p>Riaz had to concede that point. Forget about Tarah being submissive\u2014maternal wolves would fight to the death to protect their young.</p><p>\u201cBuuuuut,\u201d Adria drawled, \u201cfive minutes before I left, I got a call from Simran and In\u00e9s. In the area. Shopping. Heard we were nearby, said they\u2019d come join the group.\u201d A narrow-eyed look, but her tone was admiring. \u201cThe man is devious.\u201d</p><p>Riaz chuckled. \u201cOf course he is.\u201d Brute strength alone did not the alpha of a pack make. \u201cYou think Sienna\u2019s figured it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the little smile she got on her face when Simran called, yes. She wasn\u2019t mad\u2014I think she realizes exactly how hard this must be for Hawke.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s wolf growled in disagreement. \u201cIf she did, she\u2019d have stayed safe in our territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she was the kind of woman to do that,\u201d Adria responded, \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to be mate to an alpha.\u201d She fed him another bite of pie. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between taking sensible precautions and tucking your tail between your legs.\u201d</p><p>It took conscious effort to think past his protective instincts, to understand that when a man chose a strong woman for his own, he made a commitment to nurture and respect that strength. Adria would never allow him to coddle her\u2014but as Sienna didn\u2019t fight Hawke\u2019s need to ensure her safety, Adria allowed Riaz to hold her, trusted him to take care of her in a hundred small ways that soothed his wolf. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was no longer any hint of distance between them, that night under the moon having forged a bond that was young, raw, and hauntingly powerful. He couldn\u2019t imagine waking without her, loved to fall asleep with his legs tangled in her own, her husky voice the last thing he heard. He knew that when the urge to roam isolated reaches awoke again within his wolf, he\u2019d coax her to go along. Solitude would be no fun without her.</p><p>Picking up her hand, he pressed a kiss to her knuckles. \u201cThank you for being mine.\u201d</p><p>A startled look, followed by a smile that lit up her eyes. \u201cDitto.\u201d</p> <p>He was still smiling when they walked into the light-filled lobby of the art deco hotel where they were to meet Bo and his liaison. That was when Riaz took an emotional kick to the chest that knocked all the air out of him.</p><p>ADRIA\u2019S wolf punched to the surface the instant she sensed the sudden tension that gripped Riaz\u2019s body. On alert for a security risk, she followed his gaze to where Bowen stood with a woman of about five-two, maybe three, her hair a shining gold she\u2019d pinned into a neat roll, her body clothed in a fitted aquamarine shift that set off eyes of gentle gray.</p><p>No weapon. No threat. Only a lovely woman ... from Europe.</p><p>A horrible sick feeling in her stomach, Adria looked from the stranger to Riaz, saw the shock that had turned his eyes wild, and she knew. She knew. But the woman and Bo had seen them, were walking over, and somehow, she managed to make it through the introductions. Yet even through the ringing in her skull, the nausea choking her throat, she noticed that Riaz never touched the woman\u2014Lisette, her name was Lisette\u2014never even looked at her properly.</p><p>\u201cLisette used to be the business manager for another company,\u201d Bo said to Adria, \u201cbut she\u2019s taken up a permanent position with us.\u201d Smooth as silk, not even a hint that that other company was a front for the Alliance. \u201cHer specialty is in communications\u2014the perfect choice for a liaison.\u201d</p> <p>Riaz folded his arms. \u201cIs Emil with you?\u201d</p><p>Adria caught what she thought was distress in Lisette\u2019s expression before the other woman smiled and replied in French-accented English. \u201cNo, he had some business in Berlin.\u201d Glancing at Adria, she said, \u201cRiaz and my husband worked together on a project while Riaz was in Europe.\u201d</p><p>God, Adria thought, how that must\u2019ve killed Riaz. Her pain for him was endless, her own anguish a cavernous darkness inside of her. To know and accept that the man she loved had a mate, and to come face-to-face with that mate were two different things. It ripped away the rose-colored lenses she\u2019d put on since the night under the moon, slapped her in the face with the reality of her status as nothing but a substitute for the woman Riaz really wanted.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how she got through the meeting, but neither she nor Riaz said a word about it until they were in SnowDancer territory. \u201cSo ... she\u2019s the one.\u201d A statement that was in reality, a question, because she needed to have it confirmed, to hear it from his mouth. Yet, some small part of her was a child, wanting to hear him say, \u201cNo,\u201d and tell her she was imagining things, even when the truth was a neon sign in front of her.</p><p>Riaz brought the car to a halt. \u201cIt changes nothing between us.\u201d His response was harsh, the hand he placed against her cheek rough with warmth. \u201cYou\u2019re the one in my heart.\u201d</p><p>No, I\u2019m the consolation prize. They both knew he was only with her because he couldn\u2019t be with Lisette. Pride choked up her throat, but she didn\u2019t shove his hand aside, didn\u2019t tell him to get the hell away from her\u2014she\u2019d come into this with her eyes wide open. To punish him for something over which he had no control, to walk away at this moment when she knew he had to be suffering the most vicious pain ... no, she couldn\u2019t do that to her black wolf. Love, she realized at that terrible moment of truth, could be incredibly unselfish, even when it hurt until she bled.</p> <p>Unclipping her safety belt, then his, she crawled over to straddle his lap, wrapping her arms around him. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>SHE broke him, Riaz thought, his arms clenching around the sleek muscle of her body, his heart thundering. Unable to speak, he buried his face in her neck, drawing in the strange delicacy of her scent, so complex and unique. It anchored his shocked and newly wounded wolf, calmed the man.</p><p>He\u2019d expected fury, had thought he might find himself out in the cold when he needed her more than ever. The one thing he\u2019d never expected was this generosity of spirit, and he should have, because she\u2019d shown him over and over that she wasn\u2019t only a tough-skinned soldier, but a woman of empathy and heart, a woman any man would be proud to call his own.</p><p>Pressing a kiss to the beat of the pulse in her neck, he felt her hand stroke through his hair. His wolf basked in the tenderness. \u201cIt was the shock more than anything,\u201d he said, her skin so soft under his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine now.\u201d</p><p>Adria rubbed her cheek against his before she drew back. \u201cNo pretence, Riaz,\u201d she said, holding his gaze with the unflinching honesty of her own. \u201cYou tell me if this isn\u2019t working for you.\u201d</p><p>He fisted his hand in her hair, shock obliterated by possessive fury. \u201cIt damn well is.\u201d Maybe he\u2019d gone into this relationship needing the comfort of a packmate\u2019s touch, but now? Now he\u2019d staked his claim. \u201cYou\u2019re mine.\u201d The wolf growled in agreement. \u201cI am never letting you go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 57</p><p>VASIC WAS IN a remote, night-shrouded part of Nunavut, Canada, talking with Aden about their progress in tracking Henry, when a shudder rocked him. Initially, he thought the Cape Dorset region had experienced an earth tremor.</p> <p>Then Aden shook his head. \u201cSomething\u2019s happened in the Net.\u201d</p><p>A split second later, having opened his psychic eye, Vasic dove into the slipstream of the PsyNet as Aden did the same. The Net was the biggest data archive in the world, millions, trillions of pieces of data uploaded into it each and every day. But rather than the relatively smooth rivers of information Vasic was used to seeing, this section of the Net was twisted, crumpling in on itself.</p><p>Shield! he telepathed to Aden.</p><p>Around them, the star-studded black of the Net was literally collapsing, taking the hundreds of minds anchored in this section with it. He expanded his shields to protect as many minds as he could, but while he was a powerful Tk-V, Aden was the stronger telepath, able to shield a far greater number.</p><p>Straining in his physical body, he focused on holding the shields on those he\u2019d managed to grab from the edges of the disaster zone, not thinking about the ones who\u2019d been caught in the collapse. Severed from the Net, they would\u2019ve died a quick and violently painful death.</p><p>Aden, he telepathed when he saw the edge begin to expand in a rippling wave. His telepathic abilities weren\u2019t enough to hold back the continuing cascade of destruction and protect at the same time.</p><p>I\u2019ve called the others.</p><p>But someone else arrived before the rest of the squad, and his power was so vast it blinded. He single-handedly built a buttress around the collapse, sealing up the breach, until Vasic could release the minds he\u2019d protected.</p><p>Krychek\u2019s not only a cardinal Tk.</p><p>A dual cardinal, Aden replied. Impossible.</p><p>Except that much telepathic power was nothing less than cardinal level.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s holding,\u201d Krychek said on the psychic plane, the conversation protected from leaking into the PsyNet by shields of impenetrable black. \u201cCan you get into the collapsed section to check the extent of the damage? I need to maintain this suture until the Net seals itself.\u201d</p><p>Aden checked with Vasic, got a risk assessment identical to the one he\u2019d made. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave this small window open for you.\u201d Kaleb indicated the coordinates. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>Diving into the twisted wreckage, Vasic at his back, Aden maintained heavy shielding as he navigated broken pathways that threatened to cut and shove into his mind, the blackness of the Net somehow jagged and devoid of life. \u201cStop.\u201d He made Vasic check his biofeedback link, as he did the same.</p><p>Only when he was satisfied that their link to the Net was holding, regardless of the fact they were now in a \u201cdead\u201d section, did they continue. It didn\u2019t take them long to find the locus and the cause of the unprecedented network failure. The Net had imploded into a sharp point at that location, as if the psychic fabric had been sucked into a vortex.</p><p>\u201cThe anchor for this region,\u201d he said to Vasic, \u201cis dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis death alone wouldn\u2019t have caused this. There are multiple fail-safes.\u201d Vasic went closer to the frozen vortex, the mangled fabric of the Net having created a natural plug ... too late to save the men, women, and children caught within. We need to find the body.</p><p>Returning through the window Krychek had left, they informed him of the lack of survivors, watched him start to finalize the seal. \u201cThe anchor is dead,\u201d Aden said. \u201cWe\u2019ll work to locate the body.\u201d</p><p>Dropping from the psychic plane, he waited for Vasic to open his eyes. The Tk-V brought up something on the computronic gauntlet on his arm as soon as he did so. \u201cI\u2019m accessing the anchor files for this region.\u201d</p><p>Aden waited, aware Vasic was searching for an image he could focus on for a teleport.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d An instant later, the Tk-V teleported them directly in front of a two-story cottage on the edge of Cape Dorset. The lack of neighbors was unusual for a Psy\u2014but not for an anchor. Many members of Designation A craved isolation.</p><p>It was because, an anchor had once explained to Aden, they were constantly surrounded by others on the Net. Unlike with ordinary Psy, an anchor could not shut off that awareness\u2014it was an inbuilt component of their ability to hold the Net in place. Their relative seclusion on the physical plane was a psychological coping mechanism.</p><p>Light spilled from the cottage, and when Aden made his way to one of the windows, using the shadows outside to his advantage, he saw no hint of danger. I\u2019ll ring the doorbell.</p><p>Wait until I\u2019m inside.</p><p>Vasic heard the clear tones of the bell echo through the house a second after he teleported into the room visible from the window. When there was no other sound or movement, he let Aden in. Working in practiced silence, they checked the first floor and found nothing, before heading up to the second. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There. Aden nodded at a drop of what looked like blood on the carpet that covered the steps.</p><p>Halting, Vasic looked more carefully and saw two other drops. Whoever did it, passed this way.</p><p>The body was in the corner room the anchor had used as his office. From the dents and the blood splatter, he\u2019d been flung violently to the wall at least twice. \u201cThis is the work of a Tk,\u201d Vasic said out loud, after scanning the room for listening devices, the scanner\u2014able to be adapted to many tasks\u2014built into his gauntlet.</p> <p>Aden didn\u2019t say anything until he\u2019d walked over and checked the anchor\u2019s throat for a pulse. \u201cDeath confirmed. His skin, however, is warm. Fits with the timeline.\u201d</p><p>Vasic ran his eyes over the dents the anchor\u2019s head had made in the wall. There was blood, yes, but the killer had had enough on him to drip, which meant he\u2019d been up close and personal with his victim. \u201cCatastrophic fracture in Silence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain it was a Tk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPattern of the victim\u2019s injuries added to the high-impact damage to the wall makes it highly probable.\u201d He looked at the blood-splattered mess on the desk where it appeared the anchor had been working prior to the attack. \u201cEither the uncontrolled violence is stage dressing, or someone is using an unstable Tk for his or her own purposes.\u201d</p><p>A flicker at the corner of his eye. Swiveling, he found Kaleb Krychek in the room with them. Though the fact wasn\u2019t well known, the former Councilor was one of the rare Tks who could go to people as well as places, and he\u2019d obviously zeroed in on either Vasic or Aden.</p> <p>Dressed in a pristine suit, his face bore no marks of strain as a result of the power he\u2019d expended on the Net. \u201cThe information I was able to gather from the NetMind,\u201d he said, taking in the carnage, \u201cindicates the fail-safes were all murdered seconds before the anchor\u2019s death, by killers who broke into their homes armed with laser weapons. It happened so fast, the NetMind couldn\u2019t stabilize the fracture.\u201d</p><p>Aden rose from his crouching position beside the body. \u201cThat would require a coordinated effort. The names of the fail-safes aren\u2019t broadcast, and while their security is nowhere near that of an anchor\u201d\u2014the reason why non-teleport-capable assassins had been able to breach their homes\u2014\u201ceach is passively monitored.\u201d</p><p>Which is why, Vasic thought, the entire network had been eliminated around the same time. Any warning and contingency plans would have come into play. The Psy had backups upon backups when it came to anchors\u2014Designation A was the foundation of the entire psychic framework that kept their race alive, the Net far too big to be stable without them. Kill the anchors and the Net would suffer a total collapse, taking everyone with it.</p><p>ADEN watched Vasic begin to move around the office. Quiet, calm, icily focused. \u201cCould this be the work of one of the other former Councilors?\u201d he asked Kaleb.</p><p>\u201cIt would make no logical sense\u2014fracturing the Net fractures their power base.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn individual who knew the parameters of the failure ahead of time could ensure the safety of his allies and the deaths of his enemies.\u201d</p> <p>Kaleb\u2019s eyes, living pieces of the PsyNet, locked on Aden\u2019s face. \u201cYes. However, such indiscriminate carnage better fits the tenets of Pure Psy\u2014my fellow ex-Councilors tend to be much more targeted in their assassinations.\u201d</p><p>Aden thought of the lack of support the group had received in the Net after their recent humiliating defeat at the hands of the coalition of changelings, humans, and Psy\u2014most of the population believed Pure Psy shouldn\u2019t have stepped out of the Net, that the aggression contravened their stated aim of Purity. Given Pure Psy\u2019s increasingly extreme ideology, that lack of support might well have been taken as sedition.</p><p>\u201cEven with depleted numbers,\u201d he said to Kaleb, \u201cthe group has the capability to organize such an attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd their general has the discipline.\u201d Kaleb turned from Aden to Vasic. \u201cHave you found it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The other Arrow looked up from the transparent computer screen he\u2019d brought up. \u201cThere\u2019s no message here, and nothing on the Net from anyone claiming responsibility or threatening more violence.\u201d</p><p>That, Aden knew, didn\u2019t mean further murders weren\u2019t planned. Kaleb\u2019s next words made it clear the cardinal telekinetic had come to the same conclusion. \u201cProtecting every anchor across the world is a statistical impossibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d There were too many of them, strong and weak, critical and peripheral. \u201cHowever, we can send out an alert to each region, advise the authorities in charge of the anchors to beef up security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarn them of the possibility of a strong Tk being involved,\u201d Vasic added, his eyes on the bloody dents in the wall. \u201cAt least 8 on the Gradient.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be problematic. There are very few people stronger than a Gradient 8 Tk.\u201d</p><p>Kaleb was right\u2014which meant more anchors were going to die unless they ran the architect of this attack to ground. \u201cIf this is the start of a Pure Psy campaign,\u201d Aden said, considering how to narrow down the possible targets, \u201ccertain regions are more likely to be hit.\u201d Nikita Duncan and Anthony Kyriakus hadn\u2019t only been part of the coalition that had defeated Henry\u2019s fanatics, they\u2019d also been vocal in their anti-Pure Psy views. More crucially, their region was becoming a magnet for those whose Silence was fractured or otherwise suspect\u2014anathema to Pure Psy\u2019s aim of absolute purity.</p><p>\u201cThis location would seem to argue against Pure Psy involvement,\u201d Vasic pointed out. \u201cIt has no strategic or political importance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d theorize this was a training run in a quiet region of the Net.\u201d Aden acknowledged his theory had a flaw, in that it required the aggressors sacrifice the element of surprise, but that didn\u2019t disqualify it\u2014not when irrational behavior was becoming a hallmark of Pure Psy operations. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t discount it being the work of an unknown group, but it\u2019s reasonable to give Nikita and Anthony specific warning.\u201d</p><p>Kaleb nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Vasic broke his silence. \u201cPreliminary reports are coming in\u2014four hundred and seventy confirmed dead so far.\u201d</p><p>And the region that had collapsed, Aden thought, was tiny, with a sparse population. A single sector collapse in San Francisco would take tens of thousands of lives with it.</p><p>\u201cAt least eighty-five of the dead are children.\u201d</p><p>Aden met Vasic\u2019s eyes in a silent warning, but Kaleb wasn\u2019t paying attention to the Arrow who was both Silent and broken. \u201cI have to go,\u201d the former Councilor said after a ten-second pause. \u201cRelease the general security notice, Aden.\u201d He blinked out in the next breath, his power so vast the teleport took him little to no effort. The only other person in the Net as fast was Vasic, and he\u2019d been born with the ability. Kaleb had learned it as a Tk.</p><p>\u201cHe could have done it himself,\u201d Aden said, staring at where the cardinal had stood. \u201cWe\u2019d never know with the speed he teleports.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>KALEB teleported into Nikita\u2019s office to find Anthony Kyriakus already there. Since Anthony was a telepath with no teleport-capable ability, that meant he\u2019d either used one of his Tks to arrange an immediate \u2019port ... or he\u2019d been with Nikita at the time of the attack. Very late for a political meeting.</p><p>Unbuttoning his suit jacket, he took a seat beside Anthony, on the other side of Nikita\u2019s desk. \u201cA de facto Council?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no reason to want the Net to suffer a catastrophic failure,\u201d Nikita said instead of answering, her ruler-straight black hair brushing her shoulders. \u201cNeither does Anthony. Neither do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to control the Net, Kaleb. Broken, it\u2019s useless to you.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing to that, betrayed nothing. Nikita thought she understood how his mind worked. She didn\u2019t, but it was to his advantage to let her misapprehension continue. \u201cThere\u2019s still no sign of Henry, and Shoshanna has bunkered down somewhere in England behind heavy shields.\u201d None of which would protect her when the time came. \u201cTatiana and Ming are the wild cards.\u201d Kaleb had his suspicions about Ming\u2019s involvement in the Pure Psy assault in California, but the military mastermind had been very careful to bury his tracks.</p><p>\u201cThere are others who have reason to want to damage the Net,\u201d Anthony said, and the three of them went through much the same conversation he\u2019d had with Aden and Vasic.</p><p>Aden, he thought with a corner of his mind, was the center around whom the Arrows rotated. While the telepath wasn\u2019t the most powerful member of the squad in terms of raw psychic ability, he was the one the rest of the Arrows looked to for leadership. He also had the support of Vasic, the only teleporter in the Net faster than Kaleb himself. To own the squad, Kaleb would have to have Aden\u2019s loyalty. And he would. Because Kaleb had plans Nikita couldn\u2019t even guess at, and having a squad of lethal assassins behind him would make things both deadlier and smoother when he played his endgame.</p><p>\u201cNow that the violence has a shape, will your foreseers be able to predict the next strike?\u201d Nikita asked Anthony.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve given the order, and I\u2019ll forward any pertinent information, but chaos on this scale skews and warps the timeline.\u201d Anthony glanced at Kaleb. \u201cWe\u2019ll ensure our anchors are well protected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can offer you a certain number of my troops.\u201d He knew the two ex-Councilors had limited military resources of their own, would find it near impossible to cover the anchor network in the area.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Nikita said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll decline.\u201d</p><p>Anthony\u2019s response was much the same. Kaleb hadn\u2019t expected anything else\u2014if he were on the other side, he wouldn\u2019t trust himself either. \u201cThe offer remains on the table, should you change your mind.\u201d</p><p>Rising, he buttoned up his suit jacket at the same time that he soothed the panic of the NetMind. The neosentience was scared, and while Kaleb didn\u2019t feel, he had learned to differentiate the moods of the DarkMind and NetMind both. Now he gentled the NetMind and reined in the DarkMind, the darker sentience stronger in the wake of the murderous violence. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me. I need to return to my own region.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A second later, he teleported into another room on another continent. \u201cMing,\u201d he said. \u201cTatiana, I see you\u2019ve heard about the attack.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 58</p><p>AFTER A NIGHT spent curled around the woman who had healed something broken in him, then held him as the wound tore open again, Riaz woke with his world back in focus. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he said, brushing aside the inky strands of hair that clung to Adria\u2019s cheek.</p> <p>\u201cMorning.\u201d A faint smile, the caution hidden but present.</p><p>He felt like he\u2019d been punched all over again, but he told himself to be patient. His not-so-tough soldier had had a shock, too. Leaning down, he nibbled at her lower lip in a playful kiss, one hand splayed over her rib cage, his other arm braced above her head.</p><p>She ran her own hand up his chest and around to his nape, petting him with the same affectionate laziness, her smile growing deeper. \u201cThis is a nice way to wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d He went to say something else, but the comm beeped, Riley summoning him to an urgent lieutenant meeting.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to go, wanted to love Adria sweet and slow, show her who she was to him, but he was a lieutenant as she was a senior soldier. Dashing into the shower, he walked out to find she\u2019d scared up a cup of coffee for him. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not another attack,\u201d she said, eyes of blue-violet dark with worry.</p> <p>Cupping her cheek, he pressed his forehead to her own for a single, precious moment. \u201cI hope the hell not. I\u2019m guessing whatever it is, the seniors will all be briefed soon as we\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cGo on.\u201d A quick kiss, the warmth of her lips still with him when he walked into the conference room a few minutes later.</p><p>\u201cIs that coffee?\u201d Indigo groaned as she walked in behind him.</p><p>Putting down his mug, Riaz poured her a cup from the carafe on the table, aware the other lieutenant had worked until nightfall with Felix\u2019s team, then returned to supervise her novices in a night training exercise. Riaz had offered to handle the latter, but Indigo had wanted to personally judge their progress since a couple were edging toward full soldier status. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me your boy toy isn\u2019t treating you right,\u201d he said as he handed the coffee over.</p><p>Indigo swigged half of it before saying, \u201cI shall deal with you later,\u201d in an ominous tone stripped of its menace by a jaw-cracking yawn. \u201cDo you know what this is about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Grabbing a seat, he turned toward the monitors as Alexei\u2019s and Jem\u2019s feeds came online. \u201cYou two have any idea what\u2019s happening?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cMy guess\u2014something\u2019s up with the Psy,\u201d Jem said. \u201cI went for a street run this morning like I sometimes do, and I don\u2019t know how to describe it; there was this eerie quiet on the face of every Psy I passed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it is,\u201d Alexei pointed out, \u201cif we\u2019re having a meeting and not going into emergency mode, it\u2019s probably not an imminent threat to the pack.\u201d</p><p>Tension level dropping a notch because the young lieutenant was right, Riaz went to ask Alexei about the wolves who wanted to merge with SnowDancer when Hawke entered with Riley and Judd. Conversation stopped for a minute as the other lieutenants started to come online. Kenji, Tom\u00e1s, Matthias, and Cooper all snapped into focus one after the other. Coop was as bright eyed as if he\u2019d been up for hours, and Kenji appeared to have come in from a night shift, but the others didn\u2019t look impressed.</p><p>\u201cI thought the war was won,\u201d Tom\u00e1s groaned, a giant mug in his hand. \u201cThis was my sleep-in day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that was yesterday,\u201d Cooper said.</p><p>\u201cShut up. Just because you\u2019re getting laid on a regular basis doesn\u2019t mean you have to be smug about it.\u201d</p><p>Coop\u2019s smile was slow and definitely smug.</p><p>Tapping the table with a finger on the heels of that smile, Hawke called the meeting to order. \u201cJudd, Lucas, and I,\u201d he said, \u201chad a very interesting conference call with Anthony and Nikita a few minutes ago.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone quieted. The pack\u2019s relationship with the two powerful Psy was shaky at best. There was no doubt both had done their share of the heavy lifting when it came to protecting the city from Henry Scott\u2019s army\u2014they\u2019d provided combat-ability troops, used their own considerable telepathic powers to repel the intruders. However, that didn\u2019t mean they could be trusted.</p><p>\u201cGood news is,\u201d Hawke said, \u201cit\u2019s highly likely we\u2019re no longer target numero uno as far as Pure Psy is concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you celebrating?\u201d Indigo asked, reaching for the carafe and pouring herself a second cup of coffee, topping up Riley\u2019s when he held it out.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s expression was grim, the words he spoke even grimmer. \u201cBecause the civil war in the Net isn\u2019t a possibility\u2014it\u2019s begun. The most recent casualty count is five hundred and seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Matthias rubbed his face, his dark skin gleaming in the light of the little table lamp he hadn\u2019t yet turned off. \u201cAn explosion of some kind?\u201d</p><p>Judd was the one who answered. \u201cPart of the Net collapsed last night.\u201d</p><p>A shocked hush.</p><p>\u201cThe victims\u2019 separation from the Net was so violent,\u201d he continued, \u201cthey would\u2019ve had no chance to attempt to reintegrate. Men, women, children ... entire families wiped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngry as this makes me,\u201d Coop said, his scar white from the force of his emotions, \u201cwe can\u2019t affect the Net. Why did Nikita and Anthony contact us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Net collapsed because the anchor in the region was murdered, as were all his fail-safes,\u201d Judd explained. \u201cAnchors are protected on the psychic plane by permanent shielding that\u2019s close to impossible to break. However, they\u2019re still mortal.\u201d</p><p>Riaz saw it then, what Nikita and Anthony wanted them to do. \u201cThey need our help to protect the anchors in the territory.\u201d It was a historic request ... especially when Riaz thought it through and realized the two Psy were willing to trust SnowDancer with the locations of people who were the greatest vulnerability of their race.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Judd pushed his hand through his hair, a rare physical betrayal of his emotions. \u201cBefore we make up our minds on that, there\u2019s something I\u2019m not sure you all realize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Indigo said, pushing over a cup of coffee. \u201cDrink this first. No offense, gorgeous, but you look like hell.\u201d</p><p>Judd gave Indigo the faintest of smiles, obeyed the order. \u201cEver since the discovery that SnowDancer protected Marlee and Toby from rehabilitation,\u201d he said, after drinking a good third of the cup, \u201ca lot of the Psy in the area are looking to DarkRiver and SnowDancer for some kind of leadership. At the heart of it is the knowledge that you protected the defenseless their own leadership sought to destroy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChangeling packs,\u201d Riley said in his measured way, \u201chave managed to retain our sense of identity, to survive being sucked into the Psy machine, because we\u2019re careful about who we call our own.\u201d</p><p>Changelings would fight to the death to protect the pack, Riaz thought, but gaining the trust of that pack was a hard thing\u2014as Judd himself knew. However\u2014\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sit right with me that we turn our backs on people who trust us to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith me either,\u201d Riley said as the other lieutenants nodded. \u201cAt the same time, our wolves would go insane trying to protect such a large \u2018pack.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Because once a dominant took responsibility for a group, he took full responsibility.</p><p>\u201cHell of a mess,\u201d Matthias muttered.</p><p>Having tipped his chair back on two legs, Hawke now brought it down on all four. \u201cPutting that aside for now, first we need numbers. Judd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty anchors across the state,\u201d the lieutenant replied. \u201cTwo hundred backups\u2014ten per anchor.\u201d</p><p>Tom\u00e1s whistled. \u201cThat\u2019s a damn low number on which to pin the lives of millions of people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are others, like Sophia Russo, Max\u2019s wife, who also help stabilize the Net, but they can\u2019t hold back a collapse, so they aren\u2019t targets.\u201d Judd drank the rest of his coffee. \u201cThree of the twenty are cardinals and technically the only true anchors in the network. However, the secondary anchors, trained since childhood, are just as integrated into the psychic fabric of the PsyNet, have the same vulnerabilities. While the cardinals control exponentially larger areas, taking out a single secondary hub will mean tens of thousands of deaths.\u201d</p><p>Alexei leaned forward, his blond hair tied back with a piece of string. \u201cHow long would we have to maintain the watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long,\u201d Judd said to their surprise. \u201cThere are very, very few Tks who can teleport to people rather than places. The odds are excellent that the telekinetic behind the anchor murder doesn\u2019t have that ability. Which means he needs images of his targets\u2019 living spaces\u2014and those he\u2019s probably sourcing from the \u2018in case of emergency\u2019 files kept on anchors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnthony and Nikita are arranging new bolt holes,\u201d Coop guessed. \u201cClever, simple, and effective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do it,\u201d Riley said, having had his head together with Indigo while the rest of them spoke. \u201cFactoring in DarkRiver, the Rats, and WindHaven, along with certain trained humans we know we can trust in the city, we have more than enough people to cover all the anchors and backups twenty-four seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it leave the territory vulnerable?\u201d Hawke asked, the question that of an alpha whose primary goal was to keep his people safe, even if that meant making a ruthless choice.</p><p>Indigo shook her head. \u201cNo, we\u2019re in very good shape.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s pale eyes scanned the room. \u201cYes or no. The decision will affect every single sector of SnowDancer territory, and if we say yes, it puts us on one side of the line in this civil war.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s wolf knew there was only one choice. \u201cLike it or not,\u201d he said, \u201cas the most powerful group in the area, we have a responsibility to the region now.\u201d As Riley had pointed out, changeling packs were insular for a reason, but they were not and had never been, blind to the outside world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRiaz is right.\u201d Cooper\u2019s voice. \u201cWe can\u2019t just look away while our neighbors are slaughtered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not who we are.\u201d Jem\u2019s statement was echoed by every single lieutenant in the room.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s nod held a quiet pride that said he\u2019d expected no other answer. \u201cBut, it can\u2019t be permanent.\u201d Implacable words. \u201cOur wolves aren\u2019t made for that kind of political maneuvering\u2014and I have no desire to rule this region or any other. We protect, and when the dust settles, we help the Psy population find their feet.\u201d</p> <p>An immediate round of agreement, and then they got down to the hard question of exactly how they could protect themselves and the anchors from a Tk. Judd had a simple answer. \u201cAttack with deadly force as soon as they \u2019port in. No warning.\u201d</p><p>HAWKE walked into his office to find Sienna standing to the right of his desk. Her attention was on the wall and the map that showed the land currently in the process of being replanted\u2014work that was set to hit completion this week. Knowing how it haunted her, what she\u2019d almost done to SnowDancer, the lives she\u2019d taken to protect the pack, he didn\u2019t offer her any platitudes. Instead, tugging her against his chest, he rubbed his chin over her hair, his wolf soothed by her mere proximity. Her arm came around his waist in return, but when she spoke, the words her voice shaped were unexpected.</p><p>\u201cJudd gave me the latest update on the deaths in Cape Dorset.\u201d Quiet. Solemn. As she\u2019d been when he\u2019d woken her to tell her the news. \u201cIf they obliterate an anchor point in this region, the casualty count will be catastrophic.\u201d</p><p>He should\u2019ve learned by now how good she was at ignoring her own emotions to focus on harsh reality, but she still surprised him at times. Would continue to do so, he thought, as long as he lived. There was nothing predictable about Sienna ... except for the love he saw in her eyes every single morning, his own personal dawn. \u201cWe\u2019ve agreed to help with the protection detail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Pulling away, she frowned. \u201cI know you\u2019re worried about Ming, but he\u2019s got to have other priorities right now. I can wear a disguise like I did when I went out with Evie and her family.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms. \u201cThat disguise only worked because of the context.\u201d It was the sole reason he\u2019d been able to let her go\u2014because no one would expect Sienna Lauren Snow, cardinal X, to be walking around the city shoe shopping. \u201cYou think the people planning to attack an anchor won\u2019t scan the area? The instant after they figure out you\u2019re Psy, they\u2019ll know who you are.\u201d They\u2019d also know the value of that information to those who sought to harness the fury of an X.</p><p>Stubborn tension marked her jawline. \u201cI can\u2019t hide forever.\u201d She folded her own arms, feet set slightly apart. \u201cI\u2019m strong enough to take on even a cardinal telekinetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I should just forget about the big fat target on your back?\u201d Anger crept into his voice, his wolf\u2019s hackles up.</p><p>\u201cOh, you mean to match yours?\u201d Narrowed eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll stay if you\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p> <p>Blowing out a breath, he growled.</p><p>Sienna stepped closer instead of farther away, dropping her arms. \u201cI thought we already worked this out?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d permitted her to go into battle, permitted her to put her life on the line. That didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d liked it. \u201cDid you forget the fact that I\u2019m a dominant wolf as well as your mate?\u201d He was not sane when it came to the idea of her being hurt.</p><p>She rolled her eyes at him, then smiled. One of those sudden, brilliant smiles she gave him every day, smiles that made him feel ten feet tall even as they cut him off at the knees. And when she cupped his face and tugged him down to rub her cheek against his own, her breasts pushing against his folded arms, man and wolf both knew they were sunk.</p><p>Unfolding his arms, he ran his hands down her back as she pressed a line of kisses along his jaw. \u201cNot yet,\u201d he whispered, his voice stripped to the core.</p><p>Sienna drew back, lines between her eyebrows. \u201cHawke?\u201d</p><p>He was wolf, was alpha. Revealing vulnerability, even to his mate, didn\u2019t come easy. \u201cI almost lost you,\u201d he said, the memory making him want to rage, as he relived how close he\u2019d come to never again seeing Sienna\u2019s smile. \u201cI need\u2014\u201d He couldn\u2019t complete the sentence, his emotions too raw.</p><p>Cardinal eyes devoid of stars stared back at him. \u201cI understand,\u201d she said, and he felt the depth of her perception along the mating bond. \u201cWe, both of us, need a little more time to convince ourselves we made it.\u201d Stroking her hands over his chest, she wrapped her arms around him to rest her cheek against his heart.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t expected it, that she\u2019d surrender to the violent depth of his need to hold her safe, if only for a fleeting whisper of time. And he knew he couldn\u2019t allow her to do it, couldn\u2019t steal her freedom to assuage his need. \u201cGo,\u201d he said, forcing the words out, \u201cspeak to Riley. Ask him to pair you with someone senior and experienced.\u201d</p><p>Pushing away from his chest so she could meet his eyes, Sienna touched her fingers to his face. \u201cBeautiful man.\u201d</p><p>His claws pricked the insides of his skin, his wolf fighting the human\u2019s decision.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d Her palm against his cheek, her eyes luminescent with emotion. \u201cIt\u2019s the logical choice.\u201d</p><p>When he cocked his head, she said, \u201cIf I go out there, you\u2019ll be half insane with worry and of no use to the pack.\u201d She pressed her fingers to his lips to stop him from speaking. \u201cI\u2019d be the same if it was you.\u201d A crooked smile. \u201cI\u2019m making this choice not for you, but for both of us\u2014I\u2019ll have other chances to help the pack in that way. This time, I\u2019ll help by being one of the ones who\u2019ll remain behind to guard our territory.\u201d</p><p>Taking her hand, he kissed the slightly rough skin of her palm, that of a soldier, a fighter ... and of a woman who understood him in ways no one else had ever done, or ever would again.</p><p>Chapter 59</p><p>I AM NEVER letting you go.</p><p>Adria held Riaz\u2019s passionate words to her heart during her first watch on anchor detail. But it was hard, so hard, when she knew he had a meeting with Lisette this afternoon. He\u2019d asked Adria if she wanted to accompany him, and the feral wolf in her had swiped at the chance, but Adria wasn\u2019t a jealous, angry woman, wouldn\u2019t allow herself to become one.</p><p>So she\u2019d reined in the urge and said no, trusting him to honor her faith.</p><p>But she was still a woman who loved. It hurt to imagine him speaking to Lisette, until her every pulse was a razor cutting her from the inside out. Part of her pain was for him, for the agony that had to be tearing him to pieces. To be so close to the one meant to be your mate, only to be denied. It was such a cruel idea, it made her chest ache. Or perhaps the ache was for her, a symptom of her knowledge that this truth would never change\u2014she would never be who Lisette was to Riaz.</p><p>At that moment, she could almost envy the Psy their Silence.</p><p>The older man she guarded, his hair a dusty gray, his eyes near the same shade, looked up from the papers he was grading. He was a teacher at the university, he\u2019d told her. Anchors didn\u2019t need to work, and often couldn\u2019t because of the mental discipline required of them on the Net, but Bjorn Thorsen was a mathematical genius. \u201cIt makes no rational sense,\u201d he\u2019d told her, \u201cto have my knowledge die with me.\u201d</p><p>Now, he said, \u201cA wolf in my study. The world has changed indeed.\u201d</p><p>Adria liked Thorsen. There was something about him\u2014as if in spite of his mathematical bent, he had the capacity to see the most nonnumerical of subtleties. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the last thing I ever expected to be doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m eighty-five years of age.\u201d He brought up his computer screen, showed her an image of himself as a much younger\u2014and stiffer\u2014man. \u201cAt the start of my lifetime, changelings weren\u2019t even a blip on the Council\u2019s radar. I\u2019ve watched your people\u2019s power grow ever stronger, and I\u2019ve watched my people make bad choice after bad choice. This latest state of affairs, it\u2019s no surprise.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she turned to lean her shoulder against the wall. \u201cYou expected someone to begin murdering anchors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only logical, Adria.\u201d Putting down the pen in his hand, he met her eyes, his gaze holding a fierce power. \u201cIf you control the anchors, you control the Net.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re killing, not controlling.\u201d</p><p>Thorsen shook his head, his face holding the wisdom of someone who had lived well more than twice her lifetime. \u201cDo you not see? Once they have shattered a larger, more critical section of the Net, the ones behind this will make it known they\u2019ll break other parts, murder other anchors, unless those anchors swear fealty to them.\u201d</p><p>Adria frowned. \u201cWhat advantage would that give them? As I understand it, you stabilize the Net, nothing more.\u201d The answer came to her as the last word left her lips. \u201cIf you stabilize the Net,\u201d she said, realizing the true level of cold intelligence behind the sadistic plan, \u201cyou can destabilize it.\u201d That destabilization had the potential to affect thousands, tens of thousands at a time. \u201cWhat better way to control the masses than to let them know their very lives hang in the balance.\u201d One step out of line and the Net itself could be collapsed around them, their lifeline extinguished. And unlike the Laurens, most ordinary Psy likely didn\u2019t know how to defect into a smaller network, much less have the psychic and psychological strength to pull it off.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Thorsen said, sounding like the teacher he was. \u201cOf course, such a practice can\u2019t be maintained long term. The reason anchors themselves don\u2019t destabilize the Net and hold everyone hostage, isn\u2019t only because it would be an irrational act, but because we\u2019re so deeply connected to it, any damage we do rebounds back on us. I might survive it once or twice, but beyond that...\u201d He rubbed at his temples. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her wolf went on alert. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Telepathic attack?\u201d If so, she had Judd on standby. He could teleport in and hopefully disrupt the process.</p><p>Lines of pain radiated out from the professor\u2019s eyes. \u201cNo. Dissonance programming\u2014it appears I am not meant to talk of such things.\u201d He dropped his hand, his breathing rough. \u201cIt\u2019s excruciating on one level, but I\u2019ve become somewhat numbed to it over the years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause a man of learning,\u201d she said, pouring him a glass of water from a nearby jug, \u201cdoesn\u2019t like having his thoughts truncated.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t call it bravery, wouldn\u2019t even call it an emotional decision, but he\u2019d made a stand in his own quiet way. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019ll see in the next decade of your life?\u201d</p> <p>His eyes were calm, his answer brutal. \u201cWar.\u201d</p><p>RIAZ halted in the doorway of the meeting room on the lower floor of the same art deco hotel in San Francisco. \u201cWhere\u2019s Bo?\u201d</p><p>Looking up from the other side of the small oval table, Lisette said, \u201cHe flew back to Venice an hour ago,\u201d in that distinctive clear tone of hers. \u201cThere was another attempt to take Alliance personnel. Everyone\u2019s safe, but he wants to be there on the ground. He assumed you\u2019d be fine working out the final details with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, making a mental note to follow up on the attack with her later in the day. As liaison, Lisette should have the most up-to-date information. \u201cHave you been through the communication protocols I e-mailed through? Any problems?\u201d</p><p>Lisette\u2019s smile was soft. \u201cWon\u2019t you sit?\u201d</p> <p>He took a chair across from her, and it was the first time he\u2019d really looked at her since her arrival in the country. The impact was ... unexpected. The primal draw he felt toward her hadn\u2019t disappeared, but it had dulled to background noise, leaving him clearheaded and in control. What had him taking a deep, quiet breath was that his wolf, too, showed no desire to wrench at the reins, to lunge at her. It lay quiet, watchful.</p><p>Lisette lifted a hand in a graceful motion, the fine gold bracelet around her wrist sliding lower down her arm. \u201cI have no issues with the protocols. I should\u2019ve told you that in my e-mail, but I ... wanted to talk.\u201d</p><p>He took in the shadows under her eyes, the paleness of her skin, felt his protective instincts stir. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She swallowed, shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know why\u2014\u201d Another head shake before her face crumpled.</p><p>\u201cHey, hey.\u201d Walking around the table, he crouched down beside her, taking her hands into his. \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d</p><p>It took her several minutes to catch her breath. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to Emil in a month,\u201d she whispered, her eyes red.</p> <p>\u201cAh, Lisette.\u201d Rising, he pulled her into a hug.</p><p>She held on tight to him. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I can speak to you about this, why it feels so easy.\u201d Bewilderment. \u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s wolf understood why she felt so comfortable with him, yet he knew to his bones that she wasn\u2019t the one he\u2019d go to if he was hurting as badly as Lisette was now. There was only one person he trusted enough to lower his guard, leave himself defenseless, only one person to whom his wolf would speak its secrets. The knowledge was another piece settling into place, another filament in the bond between him and his empress.</p><p>Squeezing Lisette tight, he released her and nudged her back into her chair. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked after getting her a cup of coffee. \u201cI know you\u2019re crazy for one another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething happened and he just stopped talking to me,\u201d she said in an almost sub-vocal tone. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s having an affair, but what else could it be?\u201d She wiped off another rush of tears. \u201cI said I was leaving him, hoping the shock would get through to him and he\u2019d finally tell me what was wrong ... and he said he wanted a divorce.\u201d</p><p>MERCY wasn\u2019t the teensiest bit surprised when Riley turned up that night to join her on her security patrol of the city. Her leopard butted up against his scent, playful and affectionate. Riley\u2019s returning touch was careful, almost ... tentative.</p><p>Tilting her head to the side, she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up, my personal and very sexy big, bad wolf?\u201d Riley was never tentative. Though quiet, the man had steamrollers beat. He\u2019d have made mincemeat of the little submissive he\u2019d once dreamed about\u2014Mercy had forgiven him for that, but she still liked to jerk his chain about it now and then.</p><p>Not tonight, not when he looked so solemn.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re being sweet,\u201d he said, the tentativeness replaced by frustration. \u201cI keep waiting for a hiss and a swipe with your claws, and instead you pet me.\u201d</p><p>Laughing softly, she pressed her body to his. \u201cRiley, my Riley.\u201d So solid and strong and stable, he was her port in the storm. No matter what happened, she knew she could come home to Riley, his love as enduring as the mountains themselves. \u201cI know what it does to you to have me vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>The fact she carried a child\u2014children\u2014in her womb, meant she was no longer as fast or as lethal, cognizant as she was about not doing anything to injure their young. It was the reason she\u2019d asked to be put on routine patrols. \u201cI know.\u201d Claws kneading gently at his shoulders, she spoke with her lips against his. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me crazy when you check up on me.\u201d His deep need to care, to protect was patent in every shimmer of the mating bond. That\u2019s who Riley was, and she loved him for it.</p><p>\u201cHonest?\u201d he said, stroking his hand around to her nape.</p><p>\u201cHonest.\u201d Sealed with a kiss. \u201cAre you going to stay?\u201d</p><p>He gave a sheepish nod. \u201cI put myself on shift here. I know it\u2019s doubling up, but we have enough people that no one will notice.\u201d</p><p>And Riley, she thought, had earned the time. He was SnowDancer\u2019s rock, too, had been for as long as Hawke had been alpha. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go neck on the pier\u2014Zach will cover for me.\u201d Her partner was being very discreet on the other side of the street.</p><p>Riley laughed; it was one of her favorite sounds in the universe.</p><p>Chapter 60</p><p>\u201cIT\u2019S AS I expected,\u201d Vasquez said to the man inside the sterile chamber. \u201cThe anchors in the California region are now under heavy guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but we may jeopardize our primary operative.\u201d Too late, Vasquez realized that he shouldn\u2019t have given ground on the Cape Dorset strike. \u201cWe should change the focus of our next planned hit from San Francisco to another major center with the potential for high impact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t mindless anarchists,\u201d came the rasped-out response. \u201cThe populace must see we do this for a reason. To cleanse the Net of those who have failed to maintain their Silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe risk is high. Nikita and Anthony have changeling support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich only displays their weakness.\u201d His judgment was one Vasquez shared. \u201cIt\u2019s time we demonstrated that. San Francisco remains the target.\u201d</p><p>Every part of his training told him the move was a foolish one, but he also knew Henry was right. Violence alone was not the answer. The message must be heard. \u201cI\u2019ll begin the preparations.\u201d It would take extensive reconnaissance and extreme patience, but Vasquez had never yet failed in his task.</p><p>Chapter 61</p><p>ADRIA HAD BEEN coping. She hadn\u2019t interrogated Riaz about his meeting with Lisette the previous day, hadn\u2019t picked and prodded at the unspoken truth that hovered between them, conscious that doing so would only create a wound that would fester. Instead, she\u2019d made the decision to cherish the tender and passionate tie that had grown between them, to bask in the wild affection of his wolf, and not obsess over the primal bond they\u2019d never have. So she didn\u2019t know how this had happened, how she\u2019d ended up alone with the woman who made it impossible to think about anything else.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for this,\u201d Lisette said, strapping on her safety belt. \u201cI truly wasn\u2019t hinting at a ride when I ran into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem.\u201d Having dropped off some papers at DarkRiver HQ for Hawke, Adria had been walking back through Chinatown to her car when she\u2019d run into Lisette coming out of a souvenir shop. \u201cBuy anything interesting?\u201d</p><p>The woman laughed, and it was a sweet, gentle sound. In spite of her perfect makeup and hair, her pristine tangerine-colored dress that looked both professional and summery beneath a neutral-toned trench coat, Lisette gave off a warmth that was genuine. Now, she rustled in her bag and came out with a small jade statuette. \u201cThe storekeeper said it would bring me good luck\u2014I\u2019m going to ask DarkRiver and SnowDancer for permission to set up an apartment in the city.\u201d</p><p>Adria\u2019s heart stuttered. \u201cYou\u2019d continue to be the liaison?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It might actually work better if the packs have me here on the ground.\u201d</p><p>The other woman\u2019s words made too much sense, speaking as they did to the changeling preference for situations where they could judge the other party\u2019s mood, his or her scent. \u201cHave you and your husband decided which part of the city you\u2019d want to live in if you get the okay?\u201d The question was a reminder to herself that Lisette was happily married, had no desire to press a claim on the lone wolf who was Adria\u2019s.</p><p>A long silence from the passenger seat, so long that the hairs stood up on the back of Adria\u2019s neck, her mind working a hundred miles an hour. \u201cYour husband\u2019s not moving,\u201d she guessed, knowing she shouldn\u2019t pry but unable to let it go.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was a whisper. \u201cWe\u2019ve separated.\u201d</p><p>Adria\u2019s wolf felt as if it had been kicked with steel-toed boots, was broken and bleeding as her world crashed down around her, but her voice sounded oddly calm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She understood the hurt that came with the collapse of a long-term relationship, couldn\u2019t not feel compassion, even toward a woman who threatened to steal everything from her. \u201cIt\u2019s final?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lisette turned her head toward the window, her hair a pale gold in the sunlight. \u201cThe last words he spoke to me were about a divorce.\u201d A bleak confession. \u201cI never knew how easy it was to dissolve a marriage.\u201d</p><p>The other woman\u2019s despair was a black wave, and Adria knew Lisette\u2019s love for her husband hadn\u2019t died, just been badly bruised. Riaz deserved more, deserved a woman who\u2019d give him everything ... but Lisette was his mate. And she was now free.</p><p>Adria wasn\u2019t sure how she managed to function the rest of the drive to Lisette\u2019s hotel. Her good-bye was curt enough that the Alliance liaison gave her a concerned look, but Adria was barely keeping it together\u2014she didn\u2019t have enough goodness in her to be gentle with the other woman\u2019s pain. Leaving before Lisette could ask her what was wrong, she drove with single-minded focus to SnowDancer land, parked the vehicle in a heavily wooded section, braced her hands on the steering wheel and screamed ... until her sobs robbed her of breath, shattering her to pieces from the inside out, the pain in her chest nothing to the one in her heart.</p> <p>No matter if Lisette remained in love with her husband, she was Riaz\u2019s mate. Adria would\u2019ve fought for her black wolf with everything in her against any other opponent, but that single fact couldn\u2019t be altered, couldn\u2019t be wished away. It wasn\u2019t coincidence that Lisette found herself wanting to settle in California, her actions colored by a connection she didn\u2019t consciously understand or realize. Riaz had to feel it, too, feel that primal draw that was the greatest gift of a changeling\u2019s life.</p><p>But he\u2019d made a promise to Adria, and he wasn\u2019t a man who reneged on his promises.</p><p>So she\u2019d have to be the one who broke her own heart.</p><p>JUDD walked into the infirmary just after twelve, aware Walker had taken Lara off to lunch. It was easy to skirt Lucy\u2019s attention\u2014the nurse was involved with a young girl who\u2019d come in with broken ribs after tumbling out of a tree, her tearstained face red, though she was making a valiant effort to fight back the sobs. Still, she was only seven.</p><p>Fighting the instinctive urge to help, he slipped unseen past Lucy and the pup and into the room occupied by Alice Eldridge. He made sure the door shut with the softest snick at his back before he turned to take in the patient. She lay with her eyes closed, her hands on top of the sheets, her head angled to the side. Though no longer hooked up to a feeding tube, she continued to wear the thin computronic skullcap.</p> <p>Her chest rose and fell in easy breaths, her lashes dark against the dull brown of her skin. That skin needed the sun, needed to be burnished. Brenna had found some old photos of Alice Eldridge hidden online, including one taken by her rappelling partner as she came down beside him. Her legs had been gently muscled as she braced herself on the wall, her smile brilliant, the unexpected blonde-kissed brunette curls exposed under her helmet shiny with health.</p><p>Nothing like the wasted woman in the bed.</p><p>Yet her eyes, when they opened and zeroed in on him, were the same. Ebony, so dark the pupil was difficult to distinguish from the iris. He waited for a reaction, and it wasn\u2019t long in coming. \u201cArrow,\u201d she said. \u201cFormer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember.\u201d He hadn\u2019t been certain she\u2019d recall anything about their fleeting conversation.</p><p>\u201cI thought,\u201d she said, her voice rough with disuse, \u201cyou were a dream.\u201d</p><p>Walking across the room, Judd grabbed a chair and sat down beside the bed. \u201cYour memories from before?\u201d Lara and the others had become frustratingly closemouthed now that Alice was awake, citing the trust a patient needed to have in her physician. But this woman had incredible knowledge locked inside her mind\u2014knowledge Sienna would need going into the future. Alice was the only authority on X-Psy in the world.</p> <p>A deep breath, ebony eyes shifting to the right.</p><p>Following her gaze, Judd saw the water bottle. He picked it up and held the straw to her lips. She took a sip, two, before halting. Waiting until he\u2019d put the bottle back, she said, \u201cA broken kaleidoscope. Those are my memories.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you know what a kaleidoscope is.\u201d</p><p>A faint smile on that too-wide mouth. In the photo, her mouth had seemed perfect for her face, her smile huge. But here, her face all jutting bones, the lushness of her lips didn\u2019t fit. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cStrange place, the mind. I\u2019ve lost me, but I\u2019ve retained the world.\u201d</p><p>Her intelligence was clear, even now, when she was so damaged. It made him wonder who Alice would be if she ever again regained her full self. \u201cDo you know when you are?\u201d A hundred years, more, had passed since the beginning of Alice\u2019s forced sleep.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Such loss in that acknowledgment. \u201cI had parents. I remember them. They\u2019re gone.\u201d Simple words to describe an ineffable truth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d There was something about Alice that made him think \u201cshe\u2019s one of us,\u201d though the scientist was human, and from a time long gone. Perhaps it was because she had tried to study the most outcast of all designations.</p><p>The sorrow in Alice\u2019s expression was replaced by a quiet knowledge as she watched him. \u201cYou wanted to break me,\u201d she said. \u201cAny Arrow would.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI needed the knowledge in your mind.\u201d</p><p>Alice\u2019s lashes came down, lifted, her chest rising and falling. \u201cStrange how I remember the Arrows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we were the last thing you saw.\u201d His historic brethren could well have been the ones who had taken her.</p><p>A frown, the smooth skin of her forehead wrinkling. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cZaid wouldn\u2019t have allowed them to put me in a box.\u201d</p><p>Za-eed.</p><p>Alice\u2019s pronunciation of the name, Judd thought, was perfect. It was her acquaintance with it that surprised him. Zaid Adelaja had created the squad, been the first Arrow, a telepath with a ferocious ability in mental combat. \u201cYou knew Zaid?\u201d It wasn\u2019t impossible\u2014if Judd was right about the date of Zaid\u2019s death, the other male\u2019s lifetime would\u2019ve intersected with Alice\u2019s.</p><p>Her hand fisted on the white sheet. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>Shattered memories, he reminded himself, certain she wasn\u2019t healthy enough to lie. \u201cYou\u2019ll remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound more certain than the lovely healer with the black curls.\u201d A pause, her fingers rising to touch the computronic skullcap that covered her shaved head. \u201cI had curls. So many colors in there\u2014as if my father\u2019s blond and my mother\u2019s black hair collided in me.\u201d Dropping her hand, she stared at the wall, her gaze distant.</p><p>He wondered what she saw, but he kept his peace for now. Force would not make Alice remember, regardless of how important it was that she did. Rising, he returned the chair to its spot against the wall and was about to leave when Alice spoke again.</p><p>\u201cAll I remember before you,\u201d she whispered, \u201cis sadness, such terrible sadness. It made my heart tear in pain, until the agony took over my world. Zaid ... Zaid was there.\u201d</p><p>ARRIVING back in the den four hours after she\u2019d dropped off Lisette, Adria might\u2019ve allowed herself a little more room to breathe, hope struggling to find a ray of light in the darkness, but then she saw Riaz walking toward her, and knew time had run out.</p><p>Riaz\u2019s smile reached his eyes. \u201cHello, Empress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey you.\u201d Flowing into his arms, she let the strength and heat of him surround her one last time. \u201cDo you have time to talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few minutes,\u201d he said, wrapping the long tail of her hair around his hand as he had a way of doing. \u201cI have to head in for a discussion with Hawke about BlackSea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething come up?\u201d Such an everyday question. Such a quiet intimacy she\u2019d never again experience. The next time they met, it would be as senior soldier and lieutenant, not lovers who had become friends ... more.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His chest rumbled against her. \u201cJust a case of setting up a permanent communications line. We\u2019re thinking Kenji for the liaison, since I have the Alliance.\u201d</p><p>A sharp lance of pain, and she thought, perhaps it was better to do this here. If they went behind closed doors and he fought her, she might give in. But out there, with packmates at the far end of the corridor, and the exit not far behind her, she was, in a strange way, protected from her own weakness where he was concerned.</p><p>Drawing back until she could look into his face, she said, \u201cI saw Lisette\u2014she told me she\u2019s getting a divorce from her husband.\u201d</p><p>No surprise on his face, just the intense determination of a dominant who intended to get his own way. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change this, doesn\u2019t change us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt changes everything.\u201d Her voice a harsh whisper, she stepped back, breaking the connection between them.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like that\u2014she saw it in the flash of temper in eyes gone pure wolf.</p><p>Breath a jagged blade in her chest, she shook her head. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t wonder, don\u2019t th\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fucking don\u2019t!\u201d He grabbed her upper arms, held her in place, the raw fury in his voice a wild thing. \u201cI made my choice, and I chose you. Don\u2019t you do this. Don\u2019t you destroy us.\u201d</p><p>It was so tempting to give in, but she knew that in spite of what she\u2019d tried to convince herself, the idea of his mate would always be a painful silence between them. Still ... she wasn\u2019t that self-sacrificing. She wanted to keep him, and if he wanted to stay, surely it was all right?</p><p>Agony seared her blood, her wolf howling in bone-deep sorrow.</p><p>And she knew she loved him too much to steal this joy from him. \u201cGo,\u201d she whispered, and it was torn out of her. \u201cBe happy.\u201d</p><p>The sound that came out of Riaz\u2019s throat was that of a mortally wounded animal. Gripping her nape, he hauled her against him. \u201cNo.\u201d A single brutal word spoken against her ear.</p><p>Tears burned in her eyes, choked up her throat. She wanted so desperately to hold on, just hold on, but in her head played the nightmare of waking up one day to find that he hated her, as Martin had hated her. Her former lover had resented her strength, but Riaz would have a far deeper reason to hate her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, she wouldn\u2019t do that\u2014to him, or to herself.</p><p>She was worth more. She was worth being the first, the only. Not second best, not the one who\u2019d caught this incredible man when he was hurting from a loss a changeling alone could understand ... not just a trusted friend he couldn\u2019t bear to hurt. \u201cGo,\u201d she whispered again, brushing her lips over his jaw in a final caress that held her heart. \u201cShe\u2019s yours. You need her, and she needs you.\u201d Ripping herself out of his arms, she shoved through the nearby exit and began to run.</p><p>Her feet pounded the earth, her blood thudded in her veins, and her heart ... it splintered into a million fragments.</p> <p>RIAZ stared at the exit. He could catch her\u2014the crushed berries and ice and hidden warmth of her scent was embedded in his every cell. He could track her through wind and hail and snow. But he couldn\u2019t go after her.</p><p>Not now.</p><p>Not when he didn\u2019t know the words to say to convince her of a love that had come to define him, a love that bore the name of his prickly, generous, beautiful Adria.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He slammed his fist into the stone wall of the den, scraping the skin and leaving a streak of blood behind. It barely registered. Instead of howling with possessive fury, he grit his teeth, reined in his wolf\u2014who clawed at him in a confusion of rage and pain\u2014and strode out the same door Adria had used.</p><p>He needed to think, to plan. Because no way in hell was he letting her go. She was his, had given herself to him. He wasn\u2019t a generous man when it came to his empress, wouldn\u2019t return her heart. It goddamned belonged to him and he was keeping it.</p> <p>Fighting his most primal instincts, he ran in the opposite direction from the one she\u2019d taken, pushing himself so hard that his powerful changeling chest hurt with the force of his breaths. Still he ran. Until he was in the thinner air of the higher elevations, the sky riotous with the fiery dance of sunset, and his body forced him to stop. Bracing himself with his palms on his thighs, he gasped in the crisp, clean air, his heart pumping hot and rapid.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as much of a surprise as it should\u2019ve been to see a huge silver-gold wolf materialize out of the trees. Hawke wasn\u2019t alpha simply because he was stronger and faster than the other wolves in the den\u2014he was alpha because he knew his people. Shoving a hand through his sweat-damp hair, Riaz jogged over to the edge of a stream fed by the mountain snows, and threw water onto his face. The chill of it shocked.</p><p>When Hawke shifted beside him, he didn\u2019t look at his alpha. It wasn\u2019t the fact the other man was nude\u2014such nakedness after a shift was an accepted part of a changeling\u2019s life, nothing to be remarked upon\u2014but because he had no desire to talk to anyone. \u201cI need to be alone.\u201d It was only Adria he\u2019d allow close to him whenever she wanted. Everyone else could get out and stay there.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s response was resolute. \u201cNell saw you smash your hand into the wall\u2014she thought you probably broke a bone and never noticed. What the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>His rage simmered, needing an outlet. \u201cI said, leave me alone.\u201d Deciding to make his point explicit, he shifted into wolf form, lips peeled back to flash his canines.</p><p>Hawke changed between one heartbeat and the next, his eyes staring Riaz down. Except Riaz was in no mood for a dominance display. Snarling, he launched his body toward Hawke\u2019s, claws out.</p> <p>They met in a clash of fur and blood and fury.</p><p>Chapter 62</p><p>TEN MINUTES LATER, he threw water on his face again, winced. The cut over his eye had bled plenty, and his cheekbone felt as if it was crushed, though it was probably just a heavy bruise. The only consolation was that Hawke hadn\u2019t come out of it unscathed\u2014though he had managed to slam Riaz to the ground at the end, sink his teeth into the scruff of Riaz\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cYou were fighting angry,\u201d the alpha now said. \u201cMade you sloppy.\u201d</p><p>Blowing out a breath, Riaz flexed his hand. \u201cNell was wrong by the way. Nothing broken.\u201d Though his hand was red and raw, his knuckles scraped.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to talk now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou usually beat your lieutenants to get them to talk?\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s bark of laughter was genuine. \u201cAsk Riley sometime.\u201d Running his hand over the fur of one of the wild wolves who had come to stand guard while they fought, the alpha met Riaz\u2019s gaze. \u201cAdria?\u201d</p> <p>Riaz wasn\u2019t a lone wolf just because he liked solitude. He didn\u2019t trust many people with his innermost thoughts, was happier keeping his silence. Except this time, he knew he needed his alpha\u2019s help. Taking a quiet breath, he began to speak.</p><p>\u201cShit, Riaz,\u201d Hawke said when he finished. \u201cHell of a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you have the answer.\u201d Hawke was the sole person in the den who might. \u201cYou\u2019re the only wolf I know who found his mate twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you?\u201d</p><p>Riaz sucked in a breath, the pain in his chest stabbing deeper. \u201cAdria is mine.\u201d He would not budge on that, not now, not ever. She\u2019d just have to get used to that fact. \u201cBut the mating tug, it\u2019s towards Lisette.\u201d Though it was no longer a feral, possessive rush, but a gentle knowing at the back of his mind, in itself a strange thing, given that he was a predatory changeling male\u2014then again, nothing about this situation was \u201cnormal\u201d in any way.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s hair caught the light as the other man shook his head. \u201cIf I told you I had the answer, I\u2019d be a liar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d There was a single critical difference between his situation and Hawke\u2019s\u2014the child Hawke believed would have been his mate, had died when Hawke had been a boy. \u201cIf Rissa had lived...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been the same man,\u201d Hawke said simply. \u201cI\u2019d have been mated for years before I ever met Sienna, and that life would\u2019ve shaped me in a wholly different way.\u201d A wry smile. \u201cWho knows, I might even have been a nice guy.\u201d</p><p>Unexpected amusement threaded through the tangled knot of Riaz\u2019s emotions. \u201cI can just see you baking cupcakes.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, that made Hawke howl with laughter before his alpha shifted and padded into the stream, the wild wolves following in his steps. Riaz\u2019s own wolf stretched inside him, wanting out. He surrendered to the need, following Hawke across the stream and even higher up into the mountains. Their small pack loped at an easy pace, the wind rippling through their fur, the scents in the air sharp and brittle with cold.</p><p>The beauty of the Sierra Nevada hit his heart anew and he wondered how he could\u2019ve ever left this place of mountain and forest, lakes and rivers. It hurt his heart, the love he felt for this land. Scrambling up onto a small hillock formed by fallen rocks, he lifted his head and sang of his joy at being home ... and of finding the one who was meant to be his. His pack joined in his song, and it was good.</p><p>Padding back down, he ran again.</p><p>When the pack halted, it was beside a mirror-perfect lake. Riaz assuaged his thirst before shifting, his mind if not calm, then at least a fraction less disordered. Sparks of color beside him denoted Hawke\u2019s own shift. Neither of them spoke for long, quiet moments as the early evening wind rustled through the trees, the fiery sky above curling with an edge of indigo blue.</p><p>\u201cAre you in the mating dance with Lisette?\u201d Hawke asked at last, scratching the head of the wild wolf that had curled up beside him. \u201cBecause if you are, your wolf\u2019s made the decision for you and trying to fight it will destroy you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Neither man nor wolf wanted to be in the dance with Lisette\u2014the idea of it felt wrong on every level, a betrayal so vast, it made his wolf snarl in defiance. \u201cAll Lisette and I ever had between us was a possibility.\u201d And he knew in his gut that the time for that possibility to come to fruition had passed, regardless of any accepted rule. \u201cHave you ever known a wolf in a relationship to find his mate?\u201d</p><p>Hawke took time to reply. \u201cI\u2019ve known couples who\u2019ve been together for years to suddenly develop a mating bond. I\u2019ve always thought that perhaps the human\u2019s choice influences the wolf\u2019s, or maybe two people come into perfect sync after that time together\u2014kind of like Indigo and Drew knowing each other for so long before they mated.\u201d</p><p>Riaz understood what his alpha was saying, had seen the same thing himself, but\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the question I asked.\u201d</p><p>Husky-pale eyes locked with Riaz\u2019s. \u201cThe answer is no. Love without the bond, where the wolf accepts the lover, rather than being neutral about it, seems to stop the mating bond coming into play with anyone else.\u201d Pausing, he added, \u201cSimplest explanation is that the commitment takes the place of the mating bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I\u2019d met Adria first\u201d\u2014fallen so fucking hard for her first\u2014\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to deal with this.\u201d A situation where the woman he adored thought he was meant for another.</p><p>\u201cYeah, likely.\u201d Hawke patted the side of the wolf whose head he\u2019d been scratching, and it reluctantly made room for another. \u201cDalton might know more about this than either one of us,\u201d the alpha said, naming the pack\u2019s Librarian, \u201cbut there is something else I can tell you.\u201d</p><p>Riaz waited.</p><p>\u201cThe choice isn\u2019t yours\u2014it\u2019s always the woman who accepts or rejects the bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell it isn\u2019t.\u201d Riaz\u2019s claws sliced out of his skin. \u201cThe female might accept the bond, but I damn well bet you the male\u2019s got to be willing. This one isn\u2019t.\u201d Once, he would\u2019ve sold his soul to be Lisette\u2019s, but something fundamental had changed in him, his soul reborn from a crucible of shattering pain. He\u2019d survived, come out of it scarred, altered, stronger, a man who loved a soldier and had no desire to turn back the clock.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Adria\u2019s face I see when I think of home.\u201d Adria\u2019s eyes of blue-violet that looked back at him from the faces of the children he\u2019d started to imagine since that night in the moonlit meadow where she had become his. \u201cAdria who holds my secrets.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d walk away from the woman meant to be your mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Maybe it wasn\u2019t a choice any other wolf would ever make\u2014hell, the idea might even horrify\u2014but no other wolf had lived the life that had led up to this moment. \u201cI\u2019ve found the woman who\u2019s meant to be mine.\u201d The woman who had his wolf\u2019s wild devotion.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d his alpha asked, though he\u2019d just given his answer.</p> <p>Riaz met the other man\u2019s gaze, his anger so deep he knew his eyes were those of the predator that lived within him.</p><p>But Hawke didn\u2019t back down. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about Adria\u2019s life,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be certain you\u2019re never going to turn around and see a lack in her.\u201d</p><p>Riaz wasn\u2019t even aware of reacting. He just knew he had his clawed hand around Hawke\u2019s throat, his alpha\u2019s hand gripping his wrist in a punishing hold.</p><p>Pale blue eyes met his own, Hawke\u2019s own wolf calm.</p><p>Growling low in his throat, he withdrew his hand, his claws slicing back into his skin. \u201cI died, Hawke.\u201d Brutal words. \u201cWhen I first saw Lisette and realized she\u2019d never be mine, I broke into so many pieces I was the walking dead when I returned to the den.\u201d</p> <p>It was Adria who\u2019d forced him back to life, who\u2019d challenged, fought, and played with him until he wasn\u2019t only alive but wildly, gloriously so. \u201cI trust Adria on a level I don\u2019t even trust you.\u201d As was right. A wolf should trust his mate more than any other ... yet Adria wasn\u2019t his mate, except in his heart. \u201cMy wolf trusts her.\u201d He let that wolf rise to the surface, let it color his eyes and his voice.</p><p>Hawke blew out a breath. \u201cAs your mate, Lisette has the potential to earn an even deeper trust.\u201d</p><p>Riaz snorted, conscious the alpha was playing devil\u2019s advocate. \u201cAnd you have the potential to take up knitting.\u201d The wolf thought in far more concrete terms, and it had given its loyalty and its heart to Adria. That someone else might be a better fit, even when that someone else promised to be its mate? It was a pointless consideration.</p><p>A quiet nod, an acceptance. \u201cWhat\u2019re you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvince Adria I mean what I say.\u201d He\u2019d accept no other outcome.</p><p>ADRIA made certain she swapped tasks and shifts to ensure there was no chance of running into Riaz. Her skin hurt, her bed a cold place she hated, her entire body aching with a loss that made her feel as if she\u2019d been beaten. She wasn\u2019t sure she could stop herself from reaching for him if she saw him.</p> <p>So when she walked into her room the day after their last painful encounter and found a powder pink box bearing his scent on the bedside table, she thought the rawness of her need had made her hallucinate. Touching the box with wondering fingers, she jerked when it didn\u2019t disappear. Neither did the cupcakes within.</p><p>\u201cStrawberry cream, red velvet, banana berry, and apple spice.\u201d A knot in her throat, she picked up the apple spice one and licked up a fingerful of the frosting. The sweet delicacy melted on her tongue ... the taste merging with the salt of the tear that kissed her mouth.</p><p>She didn\u2019t remember telling him her favorites, but she must have.</p><p>Collapsing on the bed, she put the cupcake back in the box, her shoulders shaking with the force of her emotions. Good-bye, she thought, he was saying good-bye with the sweetest tenderness. It would\u2019ve been easier if he\u2019d been angry, or if he\u2019d simply ignored her\u2014God, that would\u2019ve hurt\u2014but he\u2019d sent her cupcakes and made her fall in love with him all over again.</p><p>\u201cI hate you,\u201d she whispered, dashing away her tears, and it was the biggest lie she had ever told. The lie she told later that day, as she gave three of the cupcakes to Shawnie, Becca, and Ivy, was only a tiny one by comparison. \u201cI tried, but I couldn\u2019t eat them all.\u201d The truth was, she still had the one she\u2019d tasted, couldn\u2019t bear to finish it. It would feel like she was accepting his good-bye, and she wasn\u2019t ready.</p><p>Three hours later, she glared at the polished little wooden box sitting in the middle of her desk. \u201cLook!\u201d</p><p>Indigo stared dutifully. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely. Plain, but I hear lone wolves are sometimes a bit odd with their idea of gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlain?\u201d Incensed\u2014with who, she didn\u2019t know\u2014Adria began to take the box apart.</p> <p>Indigo leaned in close to watch the demolition, her eyes wide. \u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle!\u201d Delight had her reaching for a piece.</p><p>Adria slapped away her hand. \u201cYou have to do it in the exact order or ... you won\u2019t see this.\u201d A miniature representation of the Colosseum hidden in the center, complete with carved archways and the suggestion of tiered internal architecture.</p><p>Indigo rubbed her finger carefully down the glossy wood. \u201cThis is ... wow. I\u2019ve never seen a wooden puzzle this complicated.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d created it for her, Adria thought, because he knew she liked puzzles, had to have been working on it for a while.</p><p>\u201cWhy Rome?\u201d</p><p>Empress. \u201cNever mind that,\u201d Adria said, reassembling the box under Indigo\u2019s fascinated gaze. \u201cHe\u2019s not listening to me.\u201d The stubborn wolf wasn\u2019t saying good-bye with dignity and grace, he was courting her. Outrageously.</p><p>\u201cAdria, darling,\u201d Indigo said slowly. \u201cYou do realize you\u2019re talking about a dominant male? Since when do they listen to anyone once they\u2019ve made up their minds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not helping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know\u201d\u2014a look of glee\u2014\u201cnow I understand why everyone had so much fun watching Drew drive me insane.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing the cupcake she\u2019d brought to the office, Adria took a big bite. If Riaz thought she was going to soften and melt under his charm offensive and forget the painfully real chasm that divided them, he didn\u2019t know her ... but he did apparently know of her love of Italian opera, a vaguely guilty secret she\u2019d shared with no one, and the very unsensible reason why she\u2019d learned the language.</p><p>Two tickets to La Boh\u00e8me greeted her that night, tucked into the corner of her vanity mirror. Her heart leapt, but determined to make him see reason, she took the tickets and pinned them to the board in the senior soldiers\u2019 break room. No one made any effort to claim them, in spite of the fact they were for highly coveted seats.</p><p>\u201cNone of us are insane enough to piss off a lone wolf,\u201d Simran said when she found Adria glaring at the tickets the next day. \u201cEspecially when said lone wolf made it a point to say he\u2019d hunt down and bury the person who dared take any gifts meant for you.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring the fact the other woman\u2019s eyes were bright with humor, Adria ripped off the tickets and stalked to Riaz\u2019s office. He wasn\u2019t there\u2014she wasn\u2019t sure if she was relieved at not having to test her strength of will where he was concerned, or cheated at being robbed of the knock-down, drag-out fight she\u2019d been anticipating.</p><p>Borrowing a hammer from Walker Lauren, she pounded the tickets into the office door with a nail. Hawke, passing by, helpfully held the tickets in place while she hammered the nail. He didn\u2019t say a word, his expression so bland it was clear he was highly amused.</p><p>Riaz didn\u2019t say anything either.</p><p>He just snuck back into her room and tucked the abused tickets back in place. On top of the vanity, he left a gaily wrapped box. Unable to resist unwrapping it, she found a shiny new tool kit, complete with a personalized purple hammer. Her wolf was so charmed, it took her a second to focus and see what he\u2019d done.</p><p>The hammer was personalized all right\u2014with the name \u201cAdria Delgado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Riaz,\u201d she whispered, \u201cwhat\u2019re you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 63</p><p>KALEB KNEW THE Arrows had a discreet watch on him, but he had long ago perfected the ability to move through the Net undetected, and he used that ability now. He was too close to locating his target to allow any obstruction or delay.</p><p>Anyone who tried to stop him would soon discover that unlike the others who had once been Council, he didn\u2019t mind getting blood on his hands.</p><p>Chapter 64</p><p>DEEPLY SATISFIED WITH the fact that he\u2019d forced Adria to play with him, even if she might not see things in the same light, Riaz went looking for Dalton the next morning. Hawke\u2019s thought was a good one\u2014the Librarian carried the pack\u2019s history in his mind, might well know of an analogous situation, information that could aid Riaz in his campaign to convince Adria that what they had was right, was true. He\u2019d take all the support he could get if it would help him court his empress back into his arms.</p><p>When he arrived at Dalton\u2019s study, it was to find a note on the elder\u2019s door saying he was at his \u201clake office.\u201d Smiling, Riaz jogged down to the edge of the lake nearest the den, aware Lara\u2019s grandfather liked to sit not on the pebbled shore, but up on the grassy verge, beneath the spreading branches of a thickly leafed oak.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re contemporaries of a sort,\u201d he\u2019d once said to Riaz, patting the trunk of the still-growing tree. \u201cThough I fear she\u2019ll outlast me.\u201d</p><p>Now, he raised his fox brown gaze as Riaz appeared out of the trees. \u201cAh, there you are,\u201d the Librarian said, as if he\u2019d been expecting the visit. \u201cCome and talk to me, Mr. Delgado.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s wolf sat straight up, reminded of a hundred childhood scrapes. \u201cYou only ever used our last names when we were in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s dark skin shimmered with warmth, his eyes dancing. \u201cYou have the same look to you today,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat have you done, pup?\u201d</p><p>Taking a seat beside the elder, Riaz told him everything, aware he couldn\u2019t hide the truth if he wanted Dalton to understand a situation that should\u2019ve been an impossibility. After he finished, Dalton sighed, his gaze on the lake. \u201cLook at it, so smooth, with only the faintest of ripples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wind\u2019s calm this morning.\u201d</p><p>Dalton said nothing for a long time, until those who had not grown up with his presence would have believed him asleep. Riaz knew better, understood the white-haired elder saw everything with those bright eyes he\u2019d bequeathed his granddaughter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe Territorial Wars were a storm,\u201d Dalton said at last, \u201ccreating a thousand ripples. Shattering everything that should be.\u201d</p><p>Including, Riaz understood with a painful burst of raw hope, the normal rules when it came to courtship and mating.</p><p>\u201cRecords from that time are fragmented at best,\u201d Dalton continued. \u201cMany Librarians were killed in the fighting, while others made the choice to begin anew when the postwar packs were founded.\u201d</p> <p>Riaz thought back to his history lessons as a boy, recalled that decimated by the bloodshed, a number of packs had amalgamated across the country, each group choosing a new name to represent their varied membership. \u201cSo a lot of the records made during the wars may have been destroyed?\u201d Regardless of his intense frustration at coming up against the roadblock, he could understand the survivors\u2019 desire to leave the horror of war in the past\u2014especially when some of those who had amalgamated had once been bitter enemies.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Dalton put his hand on Riaz\u2019s shoulder, squeezed. \u201cBut some believed as I do, that the past must not be forgotten, no matter if it is the Librarian alone who knows the truth. Those records exist.\u201d Squeezing again, his fingers strong despite their apparently gnarled state, he dropped his hand back into his lap. \u201cEven in war, the rejection of a mate was a rare thing. More often, when it happened to combatants on opposite sides of the line, the choice was made to come together, to attempt to effect peace. Sometimes, it worked. Other times...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey failed, were executed,\u201d Riaz guessed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Dalton answered, to his surprise. \u201cMating is so precious a gift that even warring alphas would not execute those of their packs who bonded with the enemy\u2014but such bonded could not be allowed to remain in either pack. The mated can keep no secrets from one another.\u201d</p><p>Riaz thought of Mercy and Riley, and the impossibility of the pair remaining part of their respective packs if SnowDancer and DarkRiver went to war. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been hell.\u201d To walk away from your pack was no easy thing, not for a wolf.</p> <p>\u201cEspecially for the most dominant, the wolves the packs desperately needed to protect their vulnerable. The one unambiguous case I know of where two changelings who felt the mating urge chose to reject one another, involved enemy lieutenants.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s wolf lowered his head, comprehending the agony that had to have torn those two apart. Mating was a joy every changeling hoped for, but protecting those under their care was as primal a drive. No dominant could walk away from that duty and live with himself\u2014the guilt would poison any relationship. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d It was a crucial question.</p><p>Dalton rubbed a fallen oak leaf between his fingertips. \u201cThe records aren\u2019t as clear on that, but there are hints the nascent bond may have broken under the force of the dual repudiation.\u201d</p><p>The ember of hope within Riaz flared brighter\u2014Lisette\u2019s continued and deep love for Emil was as much a rejection as Riaz\u2019s conscious one, their situation not so very different from Dalton\u2019s lieutenants. \u201cSo they were able to bond with other people?\u201d To have the chance to mate with Adria...</p><p>Dalton\u2019s smile was sad. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know\u2014they both died in the final battles.\u201d Glancing at Riaz, he shook his head. \u201cSuch disappointment. You wanted a road to follow, but all I give you are ghosts and shadows.\u201d</p><p>Shoving his hands through his hair, Riaz rose to his feet, paced across the pebbles and to the water\u2019s edge before walking back to crouch beside Dalton. \u201cThere is no reason for the female to have a choice if it means nothing,\u201d he said at last, because while Dalton would share information, he had always made his students find the answers to their own questions.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Wrinkles fanned out from the corners of the Librarian\u2019s eyes. \u201cPerhaps you will be the one who solves this riddle, eh, Riaz? It is ever the lone wolf\u2019s task to journey into the unknown alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not alone,\u201d Riaz said at once, the words requiring no thought. \u201cAdria walks beside me.\u201d Even if the stubborn she-wolf didn\u2019t see it yet.</p><p>Dalton smiled. \u201cSo.\u201d</p><p>And Riaz understood that while a mate bond would be an incredible happiness, the lack of it did nothing to diminish his love for Adria, his wolf\u2019s devotion absolute. \u201cCall me a fool and be done with it then,\u201d he said to the elder who saw the present and past both with crystal clarity.</p><p>Reaching out, Dalton instead patted Riaz\u2019s cheek as he\u2019d once patted the tree trunk. \u201cGo court the one you have chosen, pup, and leave an old man to his ruminations.\u201d</p><p>IT wasn\u2019t until Adria walked into the garage that night\u2014two days after Riaz began his relentless pursuit\u2014that she realized she\u2019d been outflanked. \u201cI thought I was on watch with Sam.\u201d The tiny carving this stubborn wolf had left sitting in her locker earlier, of a hilariously drunken skunk, burned a hole in her pocket.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll only give you so much space,\u201d Riaz said, his smile dangerous, \u201cand you\u2019ve used up your quota.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t tell him he was an arrogant S.O.B. who had a store of impossible charm, and she didn\u2019t wrap her starved body around him until nothing hurt anymore. Instead, she got into the SUV and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a chance to read the entire brief.\u201d Three of her kids had been pulled into the principal\u2019s office\u2014proof that being submissive didn\u2019t mean good behavior. She\u2019d spent the past two hours getting to the bottom of things. \u201cAnything I need to know about this particular anchor or the location?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s standard.\u201d A pause. \u201cHold on.\u201d The SUV shuddered over a hole in the road.</p><p>Ignoring the jolt, Adria pulled out her mini datapad. \u201cI better scan it anyway\u2014I\u2019d tell off my trainees if they skipped homework.\u201d She focused, managed to absorb the material, but when she tried to carry on and catch up on the pack-wide senior soldiers bulletin, it proved a failed effort. She couldn\u2019t turn off her wolf\u2019s awareness of the male in the passenger seat, the one who did not belong to her, regardless of the unexpected, wonderful battle he was waging.</p><p>\u201cI saw Lisette yesterday,\u201d he said without warning.</p><p>The words in front of her blurred. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in love with me.\u201d The words were hard, making it clear that courtship or not, his anger had in no way dimmed.</p><p>It somehow hit her deeper, that even though he was so mad at her, he continued to want her, continued to court her.</p><p>\u201cWhich is great,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not in love with her either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it time.\u201d Love and the mating bond were interlocked for every mated couple she\u2019d ever met\u2014she wasn\u2019t going to fool herself by pretending they would be the exception that proved the rule.</p><p>\u201cGod you\u2019re obstinate.\u201d It was a snarl. \u201cMust make me a masochist that I like that about you.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf bared its canines, charmed but trying not to allow it to matter. \u201cI only get worse the more you know me. Consider it a lucky escape.\u201d</p><p>The smile Riaz shot her was feral. \u201cI\u2019m not the one thinking of escape\u2014and just in case you haven\u2019t figured it out, I\u2019m not about to let you succeed.\u201d</p><p>With that warning, he brought the SUV to a stop in the drive of a small home tucked neatly in the Presidio, enough land around it that the place must\u2019ve cost a substantial sum.</p><p>Stepping out of the vehicle, she circled around the front. Riaz met her there, curling his fingers around her upper arm when she would\u2019ve moved past. She jerked, the spark of contact explosive. \u201cI\u2019m not going to leave,\u201d he murmured, his breath hot against her lips, \u201cand I\u2019m not going to change my mind, so get used to having to deal with me.\u201d</p><p>Hope was a tiny light in her heart she no longer had the willpower to stamp out. \u201cWe have a job to do.\u201d Practical words, but her voice held a vulnerability that terrified her\u2014especially when she saw Riaz\u2019s eyes turn night-glow and knew he\u2019d heard it, too.</p><p>SIENNA stopped on a promontory, looking out over the land below. It was her second day in a row on the routine task of running perimeter security\u2014though Riley made sure her routes remained erratic\u2014but she didn\u2019t mind. As she\u2019d said to Hawke, this time around, it was how she could help the pack.</p><p>\u201cAnchor watch isn\u2019t much more exciting,\u201d Riordan had said to her as he left tonight to act as backup to two senior soldiers, no novices having been posted as main guards. \u201cMostly they just sit there working or reading, or sleeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaria said you had a good story about your first anchor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s the one who kept watching me as if she was waiting for me to grow fangs and try to eat her. I couldn\u2019t help it\u2014I used my claws to scratch my nose. Her eyes almost popped out of their sockets.\u201d</p><p>Smiling at the memory, she wondered if those in the PsyNet would have offered another group such help. Once, she would\u2019ve said no. But now ... Though Nikita Duncan and Anthony Kyriakus might have helped defend San Francisco out of their own self-interest, stories had come in, in the aftermath of the battle, that told of ordinary Psy helping their fellow man, regardless of race.</p><p>A DarkRiver soldier had fallen in combat, been dragged inside by two elderly Psy women while they held back his attackers using their combined telepathic abilities. One of the humans DarkRiver knew well had told of how his son, a curious little boy, had snuck outside and down a block to peek at the jet-choppers dropping Pure Psy operatives from the sky.</p><p>Out of his mind with worry, his father had been getting ready to head out into danger to search for the missing child when a Psy neighbor\u2014one of three students sharing an apartment\u2014called to say he was safe. They\u2019d snatched the boy off the street and hidden him in their home, protecting his mind from the psychic strikes the operatives had thrust out as a defensive measure while they landed.</p><p>It would\u2019ve been safer for those students, the elderly twosome, to stay inside. After all, neither an injured soldier nor a small child could offer them any tactical advantage. But they hadn\u2019t remained behind closed doors, safe. They\u2019d helped for no reason except that it was the right thing to do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A brush of fur against her leg, that of the wolf who\u2019d appeared out of the trees.</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t have much time with everything that was going on, but he always found her during her shifts, even if it was only for a few minutes at a time.</p><p>Crouching down beside his proud head, she ran her fingers through the silver-gold of his fur. \u201cWhen I think of the stories that came out of the battle, it makes me proud to be Psy.\u201d</p> <p>The wolf angled his head, his eyes piercing in the dark. She laughed, able to read the affronted expression on his face as if he\u2019d spoken. \u201cYes, I\u2019m a SnowDancer,\u201d she said, because this was her family, her pack, her home, \u201cbut I\u2019m a Psy SnowDancer.\u201d</p><p>The wolf considered this before turning his muzzle and nipping very, very carefully at her jaw, those lethally sharp teeth not even bruising her skin. Laughing again, she rubbed her nose against his. \u201cThanks so much, Your Wolfiness,\u201d she said, knowing that had been his way of saying her decision to call herself a Psy SnowDancer was acceptable.</p><p>A growl rumbled out of his chest, and she immediately recognized that it wasn\u2019t the playful one he used with her when he wasn\u2019t serious. This one was very, very, very serious. Every sense on alert, she rose to her feet, telepathically scanning the area at the same time.</p><p>\u201cIntruders,\u201d she said a second later, moving with as much stealth as possible beside her wolf as he padded toward their prey. \u201cPsy mental shields.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Crouching again, she used another sub-vocal whisper to convey what she\u2019d sensed. \u201cThey\u2019re scanning the area. They have to know I\u2019m here.\u201d Not her personally, but a mind with a Psy fingerprint. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if they know about you.\u201d Sienna could sense the subtle but critical differences between the mind of a feral wolf and that of a changeling, but she\u2019d been in SnowDancer for years\u2014most of her race didn\u2019t have that advantage.</p> <p>The pale eyes of a husky or a bird of prey met hers, the glance both protective and adamant. They\u2019d been mated only a short time, hadn\u2019t yet learned all of each other\u2019s subtleties, but she understood the unspoken message. And she disagreed. \u201cWhoever it is will know I can destroy him in a split second the instant he sees me. I\u2019ll go in prepped.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s lips lifted to display his canines.</p><p>\u201cThis is my area of expertise,\u201d she said, holding his gaze, because he would stare her down and get his own way if she let him.</p><p>This time, the bite on her chin was a fraction harder, a warning not to get herself hurt or she\u2019d be in a hell of a lot of trouble. Running her hand through his fur once more, she watched him become a shadow indistinguishable from the trees as she made her way to the small clearing where three Psy minds waited. They were shielded, but she knew deep in her gut who it was that had come for her before she ever glimpsed him through the trees.</p><p>The birthmark on the left side of his face was a red splotch, a pigmentation error he\u2019d once told her his parents hadn\u2019t had corrected because they\u2019d believed it would make him more resilient if he had to overcome such a thing in a society that prized perfection. Ming could\u2019ve taken care of it once he was no longer a minor, but he hadn\u2019t. A badge of pride, she\u2019d always thought; or perhaps a way to gain a psychological advantage over other Psy, all of whom were taken aback the first time they met him face-to-face.</p><p>But Sienna felt no shock. She knew every line and pore of that face, was intimately acquainted with the evil that lived within Ming LeBon.</p> <p>I\u2019ll burn him up and watch him die...</p><p>Her own words, as true today as when she\u2019d spoken them to Hawke. Aware the two men on either side of Ming, their hands touching his shoulders, had to be teleporters, she considered how exactly to kill the man she hated beyond all others without injuring his guards. They had done her no harm, and she would not judge them when she herself had been forced to be Ming\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e.</p><p>\u201cSienna,\u201d Ming said into the silence, his voice calm, in control, cold enough to burn. \u201cI know you\u2019re out there.\u201d</p><p>No, she thought, he didn\u2019t. He was simply taking a calculated risk that the mind he sensed was hers, having no doubt used satellite surveillance images to narrow down the range she might be present in tonight. From the lines of strain on the faces of his teleporters, this wasn\u2019t the first spot they\u2019d jumped to in their attempt to pinpoint her location.</p><p>Keeping her silence, she continued to work out the most efficient way to kill him.</p><p>\u201cThe world is changing,\u201d he said, his military haircut exposing the narrow bones of his face. \u201cWhile there was no room for an X of your toxic capacity in the previous one, there is now. The Psy will need a new ruling council after the dust settles, and you\u2019re already considered a hero by many.\u201d</p><p>Sienna would have laughed at his arrogance, but she had no laughter in her where Ming was concerned. Eyes narrowed, she lifted her hand and looked sideways to meet the gaze of the wolf who had shifted out of the shadows so she could see him. There was no censure in his gaze, only the approbation of a fellow predator.</p><p>Nodding, she turned ... and set the cold fire free.</p> <p>Ming teleported out the instant before the fire would\u2019ve hit him, and it smashed into the tree opposite, turning it into ash between one breath and the next. \u201cBastard\u2019s men were primed to \u2019port.\u201d It must\u2019ve been brutal, holding their minds on the brink of a teleport for that long.</p><p>Hawke shifted in sparks of light and color, the wolf transforming into a male who took her face in his hands and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll get him next time.\u201d</p><p>It was exactly what she needed to hear. \u201cYes, I will.\u201d</p><p>Her mate wrapped her in his arms, the soft pelt of silver-gold that covered his chest a sensory pleasure as she held him tight.</p><p>\u201cHe actually thought I might go with him,\u201d she said, the insult violent.</p><p>\u201cIf you had, it would\u2019ve ended his problems.\u201d Hawke\u2019s voice was not entirely human. \u201cNow, he has to find a way to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Recalling her dark emotional response when she\u2019d seen Hawke in danger on the battlefield, she stroked his back, his skin hot silk. \u201cMing,\u201d she reminded him, \u201cwill have to get through you and the pack to get to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll never succeed.\u201d It was a growl.</p><p>\u201cNo, he won\u2019t.\u201d The wolves might not have psychic power, but as Henry Scott had learned, it wasn\u2019t only the mind that mattered when it came to war.</p><p>Pushing away from him just a fraction, she stood on tiptoe to reach his mouth. \u201cI didn\u2019t get a kiss tonight.\u201d He needed the contact and so did she\u2014to wash Ming\u2019s poisonous words from her mind, to remember she was so much more than he could ever imagine.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you deserve a kiss,\u201d her mate said, his chest rumbling under her spread palms. \u201cSeeing as you ignored my order to get the hell away from Ming.\u201d</p><p>Sliding her hands up over his shoulders when he bent to make it easier for her, she linked her fingers behind his neck. \u201cAre you going to bite me very hard?\u201d she teased, using words her young cousin, Marlee, had apparently once spoken.</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass.\u201d Moving his hands down to that ass, he slid them into the back pockets of her jeans.</p><p>Hard and dominant though he might be, she thought, surrendering to the hot, wet caress of a kiss he laid on her, her man had a vein of tenderness she was certain no one else, except perhaps the pups, ever saw.</p><p>\u201cWe have to continue the watch.\u201d It was a rough murmur.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, though all she wanted was to have him inside her, branding her, loving her. In the lazy, possessive mood he was in right now, he\u2019d rock in so slow and easy, make her feel every thick inch. \u201cI wish it was a few hours later.\u201d</p><p>He reached up to pet and fondle one of her breasts with a proprietary hand, not helping to get her arousal under control. \u201cPatience.\u201d Releasing her aching flesh, he stepped away a couple of inches. \u201cYou know you like it slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that would be you.\u201d Already keenly missing the wild heat of him pressed up against her, she watched as he shifted, the beauty of it stunning her anew. \u201cI like it fast.\u201d</p><p>The wolf huffed with laughter, and then they were running again, the night wind rippling through his fur and kissing her face. In spite of the enraging confrontation just past, Sienna had never felt so content.</p><p>Chapter 65</p><p>DISMISSING THE M-PSY he\u2019d called to his quarters, an older female who knew the value of discretion, Ming walked to stand in front of the mirror. The flesh-colored thin-skin bandage the medic had placed on his chest hid the majority of the diagonal wound, but he could still see the blistered, red edges.</p><p>He\u2019d been only minutely brushed by the whip of cold fire, but it had succeeding in frying through his skin and thin layer of subcutaneous fat to melt muscle and score bone. A second\u2019s delay and he would no longer have internal organs, his body cavity filled with ash.</p><p>As it was, he now bore a scar that made it appear as if someone had dug a furrow through his skin with a viciously sharpened spoon. The M-Psy assured him the injury could be repaired, filled in, but Ming had no intention of taking her up on it.</p><p>Not at least, until Sienna Lauren was dead.</p><p>The girl had just proven she was too dangerous to keep alive, even on a leash.</p><p>STANDING on the edge of the property that housed the primary target, Vasquez looked at the Tk who was, at present, his most prized operative, both their faces covered by black balaclavas. Low-tech, but effective as a method to obfuscate identity. Though the Tk would not wear it during the op itself\u2014it compromised his peripheral vision, and there were never any witnesses to worry about after he was done.</p><p>Are you certain you can evade the guards? The changelings had proven more dedicated sentries than he\u2019d anticipated, leaving no obvious vulnerability. The organization can\u2019t afford to lose you. However, they had to strike soon, before the impact of their first strike dissipated into nothing.</p><p>The Tk took time to study the house, the movements of the outer guard, the second guard hidden from view in a windowless inner room, along with their target. That largely unused room hadn\u2019t been photographed as part of the security file on the anchor, so it was clever of the changelings to move the target into it\u2014but Vasquez was smarter. He and the Tk beside him had run reconnaissance on this property before the Cape Dorset operation, taken their own backup images. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As they had of a number of anchor homes in the region.</p><p>The reason they hadn\u2019t planted a transmitting camera inside was because the anchor\u2019s home, like those of her brethren, underwent a deep security scan every week. Vasquez couldn\u2019t risk that the bug would be found, the transmission tracked back to him.</p><p>I only need a second to disable the animal inside, the Tk said at last. The one outside will not make it to the room in time.</p> <p>I can provide a distraction. He took out a gun. Will that be sufficient?</p><p>A nod. Wait until I give the signal.</p><p>Chapter 66</p><p>RIAZ HAD PULLED rank and taken the inside watch on the anchor\u2014since they were dealing with a Tk, chances were high Adria would be safer on the outside perimeter. Of course, he hadn\u2019t been stupid enough to actually say that. \u201cYou look like you want to bloody me,\u201d he\u2019d muttered, deliberately ruffling her fur. \u201cWalk it off before you scare our charge.\u201d</p><p>Narrowed eyes, the violet tinged with amber. \u201cI know what you\u2019re up to. Stay in one piece or I will really hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>When multiple gunshots hit the side of the house, he thought he\u2019d been proven horribly wrong.</p><p>Adria!</p><p>Even as the rage of anger and terrifying worry blazed inside his mind, he caught a flicker out of the corner of his eye. Claws out, he was moving before the assassin fully materialized. He slammed into the man\u2019s body, trusting the anchor to react as they\u2019d practiced and duck under her desk, cell phone and laser scalpel in hand\u2014it was deadly when used as a weapon, especially in close quarters, as well as being the only offensive option that didn\u2019t make this particular anchor turn green.</p><p>\u201cIdentify!\u201d he yelled at the instant of impact, because there was a very slight chance this was a friend not foe.</p><p>In answer, the intruder shoved Riaz back with vicious telekinetic strength, crashing him into the heavy desk hard enough to fracture the wood, but Riaz had already dug his claws into the attacker\u2019s abdomen. Their violent separation had the effect of ripping the other male\u2019s stomach open. Clamping one arm over his torn flesh in an effort to keep his intestines inside his body, the Tk thrust out a bloody hand and invisible fingers gripped Riaz\u2019s throat in a choking hold.</p><p>Spots colored his vision, his chest screaming at the lack of air even as his ears registered more gunshots outside. Don\u2019t you dare get hurt, Empress.</p> <p>Not bothering to try to pull off hands he couldn\u2019t see or touch, Riaz went for the weapon in his pocket. His fingers closed on the barrel, spasmed, and for an instant, he thought he was going to shoot himself. God, that would piss off Adria. Spurred by the thought, he managed to grip the weapon and pull it out.</p><p>\u201cUseless animal.\u201d The Tk used his ability to smash it out of Riaz\u2019s hand.</p><p>But that, Riaz thought, was all right. Because even though he had no air, he could scent crushed berries in ice, embers of hidden fire.</p><p>One.</p><p>Two...</p><p>The murderous bastard\u2019s brains exploded in a spray of blood and bone as Adria took him out from behind, her weapon held with rock steady hands.</p><p>Coughing and gasping in the air rushing back into his lungs, he crawled his way around the desk to ensure the anchor was safe. She swiped out with the laser scalpel, just barely missing his face.</p><p>Good, he thought, realizing at the same instant that the spots in front of his eyes were merging into pure black. Shit.</p> <p>ADRIA wasn\u2019t fast enough to catch Riaz before his head slammed to the ground. Ignoring the mess she\u2019d made of the assassin, she ran to crouch beside her wolf, her fingers searching for his pulse. \u201cSonja, you\u2019re safe,\u201d she told the anchor. \u201cDid you make the call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes.\u201d The young woman peered out from under the dented and now blood-splattered desk. \u201cThey said they\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sensing the air move at her back, Adria swung around with gun pointed ... and recognized the two men who\u2019d teleported in from Judd\u2019s descriptions. \u201cNo,\u201d she said when they went to examine the dead assassin. \u201cCheck Riaz first. The bastard was trying to choke him.\u201d Ugly, mottled bruises had already formed on the dark tan of his flesh.</p><p>It was the Asian male with the sharp cheekbones who came to kneel beside Riaz. \u201cI\u2019m not a changeling medic,\u201d he said in a voice that was arctic in its lack of emotion, after running a slim-line scanner over Riaz. \u201cBut he appears unharmed. He should recover consciousness soon.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t what the Psy male said but rather the fact she could feel Riaz\u2019s back rising and falling under her stroking hands, his color returning, that had her pressing a relieved kiss to his temple, his face turned to the side as he lay on his front. \u201cSorry you didn\u2019t get your captive,\u201d she said, knowing they would\u2019ve preferred to interrogate the assassin. \u201cI had to shoot to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Rising, the black-clad man walked to join his similarly clothed partner, a tall dark-haired male with gray eyes so haunted, she wondered what he saw when he closed them.</p><p>Riaz groaned at that instant, putting a hand to his forehead as he pushed himself up into a sitting position against the side of the desk. \u201cI have the headache to end all headaches.\u201d</p><p>She wanted nothing more than to yell at him for scaring her, then pepper his face with kisses. \u201cYou\u2019re alive,\u201d she said, her game face almost crumbling when he gave her a smile that said he saw right through her tough act, \u201cso don\u2019t complain.\u201d Forcing herself to leave him, she helped the anchor out of her hiding place but told the young woman to stay seated on the floor behind the desk. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to see what\u2019s on the other side.\u201d</p><p>The anchor\u2019s gaze was strangely vacant when it met hers. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Shock, Adria realized. Unlike the two cold-eyed men who were examining the fallen Tk, and in contrast with Bjorn\u2019s quietly mutinous independence, most anchors were coddled and protected, never came this close to harsh reality. \u201cAden,\u201d she said, using the name she\u2019d been given for the medic.</p><p>His head lifted and she realized how handsome he was\u2014if you liked your men icy enough to give you hypothermia. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you need to ensure your anchor isn\u2019t...\u201d about to crack. Biting off the words on the tip of her tongue, she just said, \u201cCheck her.\u201d</p><p>Aden rose with an almost feline grace to circle the desk and crouch beside the anchor. Who froze, her eyes locked on his uniform, on the single star that decorated his left shoulder. \u201cArrow Squad. I thought you were just a story.\u201d</p><p>Aden didn\u2019t reply, checking the woman over with an efficiency that said he saw her only as a living, breathing machine. He didn\u2019t speak, but Adria knew he and the other Arrow had to be communicating telepathically. Finally, he took out a pressure injector and punched the medicine into the anchor\u2019s body by pressing it to her neck.</p><p>Sonja slumped.</p><p>Catching her, Aden laid her down on the carpet. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford for her to destabilize the Net,\u201d he said to Adria. \u201cHer mind will continue to maintain things as they are while she sleeps. When she wakes, she\u2019ll have the appropriate medical support.\u201d</p><p>Adria didn\u2019t like the fact he\u2019d acted without asking the anchor\u2019s permission, but then, she didn\u2019t know if he\u2019d telepathed to Sonja, and the PsyNet wasn\u2019t her field of expertise. More important, Judd had said this man and his partner were to be trusted, and Adria had absolute faith in the lieutenant. \u201cWe\u2019re charged with her safety,\u201d she said in response, checking Sonja\u2019s pulse herself to make sure she was okay. \u201cI can\u2019t release her to anyone other than you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVasic will teleport her to a medical facility.\u201d With that, he returned to his partner.</p><p>Pricking her ears as Riaz rubbed at his face a foot away from her, she tuned in to their low-voiced conversation.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Vasic said. \u201cConfirmed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Realizing the two Arrows were either cognizant of the acute nature of changeling hearing, or so used to communicating telepathically that they weren\u2019t going to let anything slip, she met Riaz\u2019s gaze. He gave a small shrug, and she knew he\u2019d been attempting to listen, too. Shifting closer, she said, \u201cLet me check your eyes.\u201d It was a ruse\u2014she needed to touch him, settle nerves that had been shredded when he collapsed.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the rescue.\u201d He sat patiently while she used the mini-torch in her pocket to determine that his pupils were reacting properly. \u201cGood shot.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf would\u2019ve happily gutted the bastard who\u2019d hurt him if Riaz hadn\u2019t already taken care of that, but she said only, \u201cYou\u2019re my partner. No thanks required.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gunshots.\u201d Eyes of palest brown scanning her body with protective intent. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the shooter had ever targeted a changeling before\u2014he was too slow.\u201d Tucking the torch back into her pocket, she kept her face turned away from the carnage, but there was no way to avoid the fact that her clothing was splattered with flecks of things she didn\u2019t want to think about. Her face, she\u2019d wiped on the clean T-shirt she wore under her sweatshirt, but she desperately wanted a shower, the scent of death clogging her nostrils. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Ripping off a clean part of her T-shirt, she wiped off the blood that had hit the side of Riaz\u2019s face, his clothing relatively unscathed because of the angle of the shot.</p><p>His hand touched her hip, startling her enough that she froze. Holding her gaze, he stroked gently. Not a sexual caress, she realized, simply comfort from one changeling to another, one wolf to another. Swallowing the lump of emotion in her throat, she threw the torn fabric into a small metal trash can probably meant for office detritus, and lowered her voice to a sub-vocal level. \u201cNot here, not yet.\u201d She couldn\u2019t afford to break down, to crawl into his arms and give in to her own rippling shock.</p><p>Cutting the contact, he nodded, and they both pushed up to their feet. Riaz was a fraction unsteady, but it only lasted a couple of seconds. In front of them, the two Psy males got up from their crouching position beside the body, the quiet one walking across to the desk to pick up Sonja and teleport out. His speed was stunning to witness, especially when he teleported back less than ten seconds later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe Tk wasn\u2019t working alone,\u201d she said to them both. \u201cHis partner shot at the house, then at me when I realized it had to be a distraction and headed inside.\u201d Bypassing the front door, she\u2019d smashed her way through a lower-floor window. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he was standing in the shadow of the stand of eucalyptus trees out front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne minute.\u201d Vasic left for the corridor and\u2014Adria guessed\u2014the window from which he could see the trees. He returned not long afterward, holding several blackened pieces of grass. \u201cYes, he was there. As was what appears to be a jet-powered motorcycle. The scorch marks on the grass make it clear he left in a rush.\u201d</p><p>Knowing there was nothing they could do to help track the shooter if he\u2019d departed on the high-speed vehicle, Adria nonetheless made a note to see if she could pick up a scent by the trees. It might come in useful later, if they had to identify a suspect. Beside her, Riaz said, \u201cI\u2019ll talk to DarkRiver, see if the shooter blew past one of their security patrols. Long shot, but worth a try.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn analysis of the weapon\u2019s signature might provide some clues,\u201d Adria said, but knew the chances were their quarry was too clever to have used a conspicuous tool.</p><p>Vasic\u2019s next words proved her right. \u201cGeneric projectile gun, mass-produced,\u201d he said, glancing at the black screen of the computronic gauntlet that covered his left forearm.</p><p>Riaz shoved a hand through his hair, messing up the already tumbled black strands. \u201cWe can continue to watch the perimeter while you work.\u201d</p><p>Aden shook his head. \u201cThere\u2019s not much to be done here beyond the cleanup. We\u2019ll take care of that and secure the house.\u201d He sounded as if the task was a simple case of spilled milk, not bone and brain matter drenched in blood. \u201cWe appreciate the assistance.\u201d</p><p>Adria wondered how often one of these men said that to anyone.</p> <p>ADEN stood at the window in the corridor and watched the two SnowDancers get into their vehicle after spending several minutes by the eucalyptus trees where the shooter had stood. He was interested in whether the male would insist on driving, regardless of the fact he\u2019d been unconscious not long ago. Predatory changeling males had a reputation for irrational behavior. However, this one bent his head toward the tall, beautiful soldier female\u2014her eyes a shade Aden had never before seen\u2014before laughing and allowing her to take the driver\u2019s seat.</p><p>It made him wonder what the woman had said that she\u2019d provoked the emotional response from a man who had watched Aden and Vasic with a predator\u2019s stealthy focus since he regained consciousness. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time the changelings have helped Psy,\u201d he said, watching their taillights disappear into the night. \u201cAnd yet we have never assisted them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe point is moot,\u201d Vasic said from inside the room where the body lay. \u201cThe changelings do not ask for help.\u201d</p><p>True\u2014the packs were very insular. \u201cIt seems all three races have faults.\u201d The Psy were arrogant to the point of not seeing the reality in front of them, and the humans, they had allowed themselves to be subjugated and treated as weak for far too long.</p><p>Leaving the window, he returned to the body. \u201cOne of Henry\u2019s. Confirms the Pure Psy connection.\u201d Visual identification made impossible by the fact the SnowDancer\u2019s kill shot had obliterated the Tk\u2019s face, Vasic had accessed the Council\u2019s main Tk database, confirmed ID via DNA. An Arrow who had infiltrated Pure Psy had then provided verification of the dead male\u2019s continued political allegiance to the group.</p><p>\u201cHave you had any success in tracing Henry?\u201d Vasic asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo. However, I have something in progress that may give him to us before the night is out.\u201d It was a bold prediction, but Aden knew his own abilities, as he knew Henry\u2019s. \u201cHe can\u2019t be shielding himself\u2014he doesn\u2019t have the skill.\u201d Henry was high-Gradient, but it wasn\u2019t always about power, as how the power the individual had was used.</p><p>\u201cVasquez must have arranged it through a more gifted telepath.\u201d The squad had zeroed in on Henry\u2019s general even before Kaleb Krychek made him a priority, been attempting to flush him out. \u201cHe continues to be a problem\u2014I\u2019ve been unable to track down any images of him since his official death.\u201d The man had scrubbed the Net clean of his presence.</p><p>Vasic walked the perimeter of the room, and Aden knew he was calculating the work to be done. \u201cDid you discover why he was removed from the training program for the squad?\u201d the teleporter asked as he turned a corner.</p><p>\u201cHe failed the psychological evaluation.\u201d It was a difficult test to fail\u2014sociopaths made the perfect assassins after all. \u201cA high level of instability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe psych eval may have been wrong in this case.\u201d Vasic returned to the center of the room. \u201cHe has run things with military precision for Henry.\u201d</p><p>Aden watched Vasic lower his head, flex his hands. \u201cHe is also a zealot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome would say so are Arrows.\u201d Blood droplets began to peel off walls and out of the carpet, coalescing into a single red stain above the dead man\u2019s body. \u201cWe very much were at the start, when Adelaja created the squad.\u201d</p><p>An elite unit formed to protect Silence, that had been their mission statement. For over a century, the Arrows had ensured no one dared raise his or her voice against the Protocol, believing it was Silence that had saved their race. Now they knew Silence had consequences that could lead to the extinction of their people, and that war was inevitable. After it was over, they would have to find a new reason for being.</p> <p>The giant \u201cdrop\u201d of blood mixed with smears of brain and bone grew bigger and bigger as Vasic collected minute traces from the carpet, the walls, the air itself. If the anchor decided to return to her home once the danger was past, she\u2019d find no evidence of violence.</p><p>\u201cWhere shall I take it?\u201d Vasic asked, his tone indicating no emotional disturbance at the grim task.</p><p>However, Aden had known the other man nearly his entire lifetime, understood how close Vasic was to the final edge. \u201cBiohazard container at the Arrow morgue,\u201d he said, and watched as, instead of teleporting the biological material out, Vasic teleported one of the containers in. The blood and brain matter poured easily into the floating receptacle, not a drop spilled, and then the container was capped and teleported away.</p><p>Vasic next lifted the body off the ground and cleaned up the blood trapped beneath, while Aden rechecked the room for any covert surveillance devices the Tk might\u2019ve planted in advance of his attack. He knew Nikita and Anthony\u2019s people had already done a pass, as had the changelings, but an Arrow took nothing on faith.</p><p>He found no sign of a bug.</p><p>Satisfied, he turned off the mobile disrupter he\u2019d switched on when Vasic \u2019ported them in.</p><p>\u201cThe room\u2019s clean,\u201d Vasic said into the silence, the corpse floating a few feet in front of him. \u201cThe morgue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 67</p><p>\u201cIF I\u2019M UNDERSTANDING how the anchor network works,\u201d Adria said, a sudden chill invading her veins as they drove through the light drizzle that had begun to fall, \u201cthen the fail-safes connected to this anchor have to be dead.\u201d</p><p>Brutal comprehension darkened Riaz\u2019s expression. \u201cI hope to hell you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, it turned out she was.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like Pure Psy decided to reverse the order,\u201d Judd told them when they met the former Arrow in the White Zone on their return to the den, his jaw tight with contained fury, his hair damp from the misty rain. \u201cMurder the anchor, then use the ensuing chaos to eliminate the backups. But there\u2019s a second, worse option\u2014that they intended to go directly from anchor to anchor in the state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill enough of the linchpins,\u201d Adria said, the surface proximity of her wolf apparent in the amber tinge to her eyes, \u201cand the support structure would\u2019ve started to crumple.\u201d</p><p>Judd took in the blood that stained the bottom of Adria\u2019s torn T-shirt, her sweatshirt bunched up in her hand. The soldier had tilted her face toward the rain, and he knew she wanted only to wash off the stink of blood and death. \u201cThe fail-safes are backups, not anchors,\u201d he said, confirming her guess. \u201cThey can\u2019t maintain the PsyNet on their own over an extended period, and even if other anchors stretch their zones of influence to cover the gap, the fabric would eventually stretch too thin, begin to tear.\u201d</p><p>Riaz\u2019s gaze connected with Judd\u2019s. \u201cI thought I got it earlier,\u201d he said, \u201chow big this is, but I didn\u2019t, not until now. Anyone who knows the locations of every anchor across the world, or in a large enough region, can annihilate the PsyNet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The reason no other race had ever been able to use that weakness to wipe out the Psy was a lack of knowledge\u2014only a Psy in the Net, one with access to classified information, could gather data on the identities and physical locations of the anchors and their fail-safes.</p><p>Adria blew out a breath. \u201cMy God ... the trust they\u2019ve put in us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether or not other Psy do,\u201d Judd said, \u201cNikita and Anthony both understand there are certain lines DarkRiver and SnowDancer will not cross.\u201d That core of honor was one of the reasons Walker and Judd had risked defecting into such dangerous changeling territory\u2014the idea of \u201cacceptable collateral damage\u201d was anathema to the packs. Children and innocents were not to be harmed, and a Net collapse ended lives with pitiless impartiality. \u201cRegardless, it\u2019s only a temporary trust\u2014soon as the anchors are moved, we\u2019ll no longer have that information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are the safe houses taking so long to organize?\u201d Riaz asked, blinking away the water beading on his lashes. \u201cThese anchors are sitting ducks right now.\u201d</p><p>Judd\u2019s own frustration echoed the other lieutenant\u2019s. \u201cThey can\u2019t be moved too far.\u201d It was a critical limitation. \u201cNot if they\u2019ll be staying in that location for a while, and we have to assume they\u2019ll be there for the duration.\u201d The anchor population needed to remain evenly distributed\u2014too many in one area, or anchors moved too far outside the region, would warp the fabric of the PsyNet. \u201cIt makes it harder to find safe bolt holes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Riaz swore low on his breath, grim understanding in his expression. \u201cBecause the assassins know they only have to search a limited area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Anchors also had a high need for stability, so they couldn\u2019t be shifted to a temporary location, then moved again without negatively impacting the Net in this region. \u201cHowever, the latest update from Nikita and Anthony gives an estimate of forty-eight hours before the relocations begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it going to get?\u201d Adria said after Judd finished speaking, fighting the urge to wrap herself around Riaz and just breathe in the living heat of his skin until the chill left her bones. She didn\u2019t regret killing the assassin, but the violence had shaken her nonetheless\u2014she wanted to kiss away the ugly bruises on her lone wolf\u2019s neck, to cuddle into him and allow her guard to drop.</p> <p>\u201cBad,\u201d Judd said in response to her question. \u201cPure Psy might\u2019ve lost this Tk, but they\u2019ll find another.\u201d Unspoken was the reality that Judd\u2019s designation was one of the most unstable in the Net, vulnerable fodder for a group that promised peace. \u201cThere is a high chance they\u2019ll move on to random targets ... to people we can\u2019t protect.\u201d</p><p>Bleak and dark, his words made it clear just how many Psy might die in the coming days and weeks, perhaps months. \u201cThey won\u2019t win,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cWe won\u2019t let them.\u201d</p><p>Judd touched his fingers to her cheek in an unexpected caress from this most remote of males, his skin cool from the rain. \u201cYou helped save an anchor today, and in doing so, protected thousands of innocents. It\u2019s a start.\u201d He nodded toward the SUV they\u2019d driven up in. \u201cI\u2019m going to see if I can find out anything further.\u201d</p><p>A sudden shiver quaked Adria\u2019s frame as the Psy lieutenant got in and started the engine. \u201cI need to shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d Eyes night-glow in the mist turning to fog, Riaz went to tug her into his arms.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m all\u2014\u201d</p><p>He hauled her close, squeezing her nape and bending to rub his cheek over hers. Stubbled, his jaw was like sandpaper, but she didn\u2019t care, his skin an inferno. All she wanted was to crawl into him and never come out.</p><p>\u201cI damn well am not letting you be alone right now,\u201d he growled. \u201cSo don\u2019t you dare send me away.\u201d</p><p>She had to, of course she had to, but she was weak enough that she clung to the solid strength of him for long minutes before allowing him to walk her back to her room. But when he would\u2019ve come in, she put her hand on his chest and held him at bay. \u201cNo.\u201d It was so hard to get the single word out past the violent need choking her up.</p><p>Eyes of Spanish gold slammed into hers, the fury in them tempered by a tenderness that killed her. Ignoring her hand and her declaration both, he walked in and closed the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cRiaz\u2014\u201d</p> <p>But he was already spinning her around and tugging off her damp T-shirt. Gripping it in one hand, his other splayed on her abdomen as he stood behind her, he said, \u201cI will never forgive you if you don\u2019t let me take care of you tonight.\u201d It was the vow of a predatory changeling male driven to the brink.</p><p>To her shame, she wasn\u2019t strong enough to push him away a second time. Instead, she let him strip her with gentle hands, let him join her in the steamy warmth of the shower and tend to her with a wild affection that broke her heart. There was no longer any anger in him, only a possessive gentleness that branded her as his.</p><p>Snuggled in a towel afterward, she sat while he dried her hair, then held on to him as he picked her up and carried her to the bed. Where he cuddled her close and ran his hand down her spine until she knew that held safe in his arms, the woodsmoke and citrus bite of his scent in her every breath, she\u2019d have no nightmares.</p><p>\u201cTe amo.\u201d</p><p>She was on the verge of sleep, her eyes heavy, but she heard the words of love he spoke, her beautiful black wolf ... and she knew this night would break the last remaining fragment of her heart.</p><p>Chapter 68</p><p>VASIC WAS A killer. It was what he\u2019d been programmed to be since he was a child pulled into the Arrow Squad. He\u2019d been so confused, so scared. Because he\u2019d still felt then, had known even as a four-year-old that the people who\u2019d come for him weren\u2019t people he wanted in his life.</p><p>He\u2019d escaped them, too. Multiple times. No security could contain a Traveler. That was why he\u2019d been placed in the \u201ccare\u201d of another Arrow, the only other Tk-V he\u2019d met in his entire lifetime\u2014and the only one who had understood how Vasic\u2019s mind worked well enough to trap him.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you feel anything?\u201d It had been an innocent question from a child to the man who would become his father, trainer, and jailor.</p><p>\u201cEmotion is a weakness. You\u2019ll be Silent soon enough, then you\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>Vasic hadn\u2019t simply become Silent, he\u2019d become even more an Arrow than his mentor. Patton had been on Jax, the drug used to control Arrows, so long that he\u2019d become a weapon that was aimed, pointed, and told who to kill. And when his performance began to slip, he\u2019d been put down like a dog.</p><p>Vasic hadn\u2019t been on Jax anywhere near as long as Patton, and so, in spite of what many believed, he could still think for himself. Jax might create perfect soldiers, but it also eventually numbed the minds of those soldiers. Vasic\u2019s mind remained razor sharp, his abilities honed to a lethal edge\u2014after all, as a Traveler, he was part of Designation Tk, teleportation not his only skill.</p><p>Now, Vasic turned from the view of the Pacific afforded by this remote headland, the grass reaching the tops of his combat boots, and said, \u201cYou have Henry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Aden\u2019s gaze was on the horizon, the sky a pale gray that merged into the black lick of the sea, sunrise at least an hour away.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t look for Henry,\u201d Aden answered in an apparent paradox. \u201cI looked for medics trained in treating severe burn injuries who\u2019d disappeared off the grid.\u201d</p><p>And that was why, Vasic thought, Aden led the Arrows. \u201cSend me the markers for the teleportation lock.\u201d</p><p>A quiet knock on his mind, a request for entry. When he opened the telepathic channel, Aden sent him detailed images of the sterile glass chamber in which Henry lay, his body scarred by X-fire. The medic from whose mind I took the images will not sound the alarm\u2014he has no awareness that I infiltrated his shields.</p><p>\u201cHenry,\u201d Aden added aloud, \u201chas never thought long term, so the fact he left his medics unshielded was a foreseeable error, but I expected better from Vasquez.\u201d</p><p>Vasic considered what they knew of the man who was Henry\u2019s general, weighed it against his acts to date. \u201cNo matter what he believes, reason alone doesn\u2019t drive him.\u201d And such a man made mistakes. \u201cWhat about Ming?\u201d</p><p>They both knew Henry had had help in his more recent military activities\u2014the former Councilor wasn\u2019t creative enough to have come up with strategies such as the sonic weapon that had turned the changelings\u2019 sensitive hearing against them. It was impossible to prove if Ming had also had a hand in the evolution of the idea to cripple the Net by murdering anchors, but the likelihood was high.</p><p>\u201cWe risk a fatal Net cascade if we eliminate two former Councilors so close together,\u201d Aden said, his hair lifting in the salt-laced wind coming off the crashing waves.</p><p>Not every Council death, Vasic knew, had such an impact. It depended on the surrounding circumstances. Marshall Hyde\u2019s assassination had caused a minor ripple at most. However, right now, the devastation in Cape Dorset had the populace reeling. Another shock could shatter a number of fragile minds. However\u2014\u201cHenry is already dead as far as most people are concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. His execution should leave the Net relatively unscathed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do you want me to finish the job?\u201d</p><p>Aden\u2019s eyes met his, the dark brown irises having a sense of life in them that Vasic no longer saw in his own. \u201cI\u2019m not your controller, Vasic. If we\u2019re to do this, we\u2019ll do it together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not rational. It heightens the risk of discovery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Aden said quietly, \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t always be so rational. Judd wasn\u2019t rational when he gave up everything on the slim chance that his family would find sanctuary with SnowDancer, and he has a life.\u201d</p><p>While they existed.</p><p>Vasic knew he would never have a life like Judd, was too damaged, but Aden had a chance. \u201cI\u2019ll get it done,\u201d he said, and teleported out before the other man could stop him.</p><p>Arriving at his quarters, he pulled a black cloak around his body, the hood and over his head, tugging the cowl forward until it shaded his face to dark invisibility. There was no need to give Henry\u2019s men, Vasquez in particular, a specific target\u2014the more confusion, the less effective Pure Psy would become.</p><p>A heartbeat of concentration on the images Aden had retracted from the mind of the burns specialist, and he was standing beside Henry\u2019s sleeping form, the teleport so precise the air didn\u2019t stir, the proximity alarms quiet. Shadows filled the muted light of the room, until he was simply another part of the darkness.</p><p>The technician beyond the glass had no inkling of an intruder, his eyes on a monitor. Teleporting behind him, Vasic disabled the older man with a simple, painless nerve pinch that would keep him under for approximately an hour, before returning to the glass room filled with the hushed pump of the machines that kept Henry Scott\u2019s mangled body alive, his breath a harsh, repetitive wheeze.</p><p>X-fire wasn\u2019t like normal fire, the damage it caused so extensive and deep it wasn\u2019t always possible to totally repair. Henry, he saw, had lost his legs, part of an arm. The limbs must have been brushed by the cold fire and disintegrated before the former Councilor was \u2019ported out. Part of his stomach was visible through the medical gown, the teak color of his flesh appearing to be merged with the melted and bubbled black of some kind of plas. His face was relatively unscathed\u2014except for the burn across his cheek and mouth that had taken his lips. Perhaps enough of a change to stop a teleporter who locked on to people as well as places, if Henry\u2019s shields hadn\u2019t been so strong. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seeing this would disturb Sienna Lauren.</p><p>It was an abrupt thought, about a girl he\u2019d met only once\u2014when he\u2019d reported in to Ming as an eighteen-year-old newly minted Arrow. She\u2019d been a child, with a look in her eyes he\u2019d recognized on a visceral level. His response to her had been one of the first signs that he wasn\u2019t Patton and never would be, the knowledge a gift that had allowed him to survive this long.</p><p>Now, having been watching the heart monitor, he glanced down ... to see the former Councilor\u2019s eyes staring up at him.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Henry rasped, his vocal cords clearly scorched.</p><p>\u201cAny chance that we may have let you be,\u201d Vasic said, \u201cwas lost when you attempted to destroy the Net itself.\u201d The Arrows would not let anyone shatter the Net.</p><p>Reaching out with the part of his mind that wasn\u2019t as elegant as his teleportation ability, but worked as well, he snapped Henry\u2019s neck even as he unplugged the machines monitoring the other Psy\u2019s broken body. The use of Tk was negligible, the effect catastrophic. Henry died in the silence he\u2019d wanted to create in the Net, and Vasic stood guard until the former Councilor\u2019s body was cold to the touch, with no hope of revival.</p><p>He teleported to the headland to find Aden seated on a bench someone had placed there so long ago, it had become part of the landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s done.\u201d Shoving back the hood of his cloak, he walked to the very edge of the cliff, the shimmering fire of the sky speaking of a luminous sunrise. \u201cWe must find and eliminate Vasquez to completely disable the Pure Psy machinery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVasquez is smarter than Henry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find him.\u201d Arrows always found those they hunted.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you die, Vasic.\u201d Aden\u2019s voice was quiet.</p><p>Vasic didn\u2019t answer, but they both knew Aden couldn\u2019t stop him. Once Vasic had paid his debts, once the Net was safe, all he wanted was peace. Forever.</p><p>Chapter 69</p><p>EMOTIONALLY BATTERED BY a tender, haunting night that had been followed by the possessive wildness of her lone wolf\u2019s loving when morning broke\u2014a loving she hadn\u2019t been able to resist, even knowing it was wrong\u2014the last person Adria anticipated seeing when she opened her door to a knock a few hours later, was Martin.</p><p>Too stunned to speak, she just stared at the sandy-haired man who had once been her lover. She didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d expected if they did ever meet again, but it wasn\u2019t this muted sense of loss, slivers of memory floating through her mind. As if he\u2019d been part of another lifetime.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she finally asked, searching for but not finding whatever it was that had drawn her to him so long ago. In spite of the pain he\u2019d caused her, she knew that in the final calculation, he wasn\u2019t a bad person\u2014it was simply that there was no strength in him, and she needed that in her man.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk,\u201d he said in a hesitant voice, his hazel eyes uncertain. \u201cI won\u2019t blame you if you say no, but I\u2019m asking.\u201d</p><p>Stepping out, she closed the door behind herself, the cell phone she\u2019d returned to the room to retrieve in hand. \u201cLet\u2019s walk outside.\u201d No matter what the status of her relationship with the black wolf who refused to allow her to set him free, she couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, have Martin\u2019s scent inside her room. It would be a betrayal.</p><p>Martin didn\u2019t say anything until they were in a part of the forest that overlooked the lake closest to the den, its waters smooth as glass today. Several packmates walked along the water\u2019s edge, played in the shallows in wolf form, or sat on the pebbled shore, but there was no one nearby, no chance anyone would overhear their conversation.</p><p>Leaning up against a sturdy young cedar, she ran her gaze over Martin. He was ... different, the changes subtle but present. As if he, too, had been broken and put back together, his face holding a maturity it hadn\u2019t had the day she\u2019d slammed the door in his face. And his eyes, they were turbulent with emotion when they met her own. \u201cI came to say what I should have a year ago.\u201d</p><p>Still unsure about where this was going, she simply waited.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Adria.\u201d Stark words, his expression devoid of pretence, of the stiff dignity that had always been his armor. \u201cSorry for being a bastard and sorry for not having the guts to face up to what I was doing to us.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t anything she\u2019d ever expected to hear, but she had the words to answer him. \u201cThank you for saying that.\u201d It meant something that he\u2019d made the effort to find her, to speak an apology she knew couldn\u2019t have come easily. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t all your fault\u2014I played my part.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t absolve me of blame I full well know I deserve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she said, because she understood the courage it took to face your own failings, and she would not belittle Martin\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cBut\u201d\u2014she held his gaze, let him see the truth in her eyes\u2014\u201cit\u2019s done with, nothing you need to carry like a millstone around your neck.\u201d Her life right now might be a turbulent storm, but the chapter with Martin, she\u2019d closed long ago. It was part of a past that had shaped her but no longer caged her. \u201cI hope you find happiness.\u201d The wish was a genuine one, for a man who had once made her laugh.</p><p>Closing the distance between them, he touched a hesitant finger to her cheek. \u201cI never knew what I had until you were gone.\u201d An unspoken question, his eyes shadowed with loss and a tormented guilt both.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a piece of each other\u2019s history now, Martin,\u201d she said gently, the strength to be kind coming not from her aggressive soldier instincts but from the part of her that understood compassion did not have to mean weakness. \u201cIn the past.\u201d</p><p>His gaze betrayed a regret that silvered the most poignant emotion through her, but found no twin. As Riaz had seen what seemed like a lifetime ago, she had never loved Martin the way a predatory changeling female should love her man\u2014until it was a wild howl in her blood, a near-painful craving and a tenderness that burned. Still, they had not always been adversaries, so she didn\u2019t hurt him by rejecting his embrace before he left.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye,\u201d Adria whispered as his back disappeared into the trees, knowing she had laid the final ghost to rest, even if Martin continued to wrestle with them. There was calm in making peace with her past, but that peace was overwhelmed by an anguish that went to the soul, as if a chunk of her self had been ripped out and the wound wasn\u2019t healing.</p><p>Because this time, she\u2019d loved true.</p><p>Until, in spite of the silent promise she\u2019d made not to ask him for what he couldn\u2019t give her, she couldn\u2019t bear to be with Riaz knowing she wasn\u2019t his one, his only. Yet ... the way he loved her, the way he branded her with his kiss, the primal possession in the rough, beautiful words he spoke to her\u2014it made her want to believe his heart bore her name, not Lisette\u2019s.</p><p>The tumult of her opposing thoughts had her wolf clawing and snarling, no longer sure which choice was the right one.</p><p>WHEN Riaz returned to den territory late that afternoon after handling something in the city, he was determined to continue on where he\u2019d left off with Adria\u2014to discover she\u2019d requested a change in her duties that saw her stationed up in the mountains for three days, on one of the high perimeter watches no one but the lone wolves much liked, they were so isolated. The soldier she\u2019d replaced was ecstatic, and more than happy to take Adria\u2019s shifts on anchor detail.</p><p>He knew the only reason she hadn\u2019t volunteered for an even longer stretch was that she was too loyal to her trainees to leave them scrambling. As it was, she\u2019d organized two special sessions for them with the lone dominant who had the gift of not intimidating even the gentlest submissive\u2014Drew\u2014and taken a sat phone with her, in case the kids needed to get in touch. A sat phone she\u2019d apparently pick up for everyone but Riaz.</p><p>His wolf snarled, but he bided his time, because when he went after her, he wasn\u2019t coming back alone. First, he had to take care of another matter he\u2019d been working on in the background\u2014and, given the shifts he was doing with the anchor protection squad, as well as his duties as the lieutenant in charge of SnowDancer\u2019s international business interests, it took him until the end of the following day to put all the pieces in place.</p><p>It was on the morning of the day after that he drove down to San Francisco.</p><p>Lisette smiled at seeing him at the door to her hotel room. \u201cThis is a nice surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk.\u201d It was past time. \u201cAbout us.\u201d</p><p>Her smile dimmed. \u201cRiaz, I sensed something the first time we met, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pressed a finger to her lips, feeling an affectionate tenderness toward her, such as he might feel for a cherished friend. \u201cI know. I don\u2019t love you either.\u201d It was as simple as that, regardless of the promise of the mating bond that existed with Lisette. His heart, the heart of a lone wolf, belonged absolutely and indelibly to a stubborn violet-eyed woman who was going to make him chase her up into the mountains. No potential chimera of a future could hold a candle to the incandescent happiness man and wolf both felt simply being in Adria\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cOh good.\u201d Lisette\u2019s laugh was a bit teary. \u201cBecause I\u2019m stupid in love with a man who doesn\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>Stepping inside the room, he closed the door and tugged her to the window that looked out over the parking lot below and the quiet street beyond. \u201cYou\u2019re angry.\u201d</p><p>Lisette\u2019s hand tightened on his. \u201cFurious would be the better word. I know I left Emil, but he was supposed to fight for me! How could he just let me go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook down.\u201d He pushed aside the lace curtain.</p><p>Lisette\u2019s breath released in a soft whisper when she saw the slender blond man standing beside a silver rental sedan in the parking lot. \u201cYou called him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been in the city since the day after you arrived.\u201d Emil was a good man, one who loved his wife so much, he\u2019d thought to set her free when he\u2019d been diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder that would mean years of arduous hospital visits to cure, therapy that might leave him in agony\u2014something he knew would cause Lisette brutal pain. Except he couldn\u2019t bear to be without her, had followed her across the ocean and kept a watch on her. \u201cHe loves you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe sent me divorce papers!\u201d Clearly outraged, Lisette fisted both hands ... though her eyes continued to drink in the sight of her husband.</p><p>\u201cCut him a little slack. He was thinking crazy.\u201d Riaz had tracked Emil down with the intention of getting to the bottom of things, of making the other man see how badly he was hurting Lisette. However, it turned out Emil had already made up his mind to reclaim his wife and trust in the strength of their love to get them through the test to come.</p><p>\u201cWhen I spoke to him today,\u201d Riaz continued, \u201che was planning to storm the defenses, but he agreed to give me a few minutes with you first.\u201d Only because Riaz had promised to try to soften Lisette\u2019s mood\u2014though until right this second, he\u2019d had no idea she even had a temper.</p> <p>\u201cHah!\u201d Lisette kicked the wall with a foot clad in a flimsy peach-colored heel, trying to push up the locked-shut window at the same time. \u201cHe thinks he can get me back just by turning up?!\u201d A rapid storm of indignant French as she gave up on the window and stalked to the door.</p><p>Opening it so hard it slammed into the wall, she headed out.</p><p>Emil wasn\u2019t looking at the hotel when she stomped out, but he turned a split second later. Expression lighting up, he went to take Lisette into his arms. At which point, his sweet, loving, cultured wife punched him on the jaw, hard enough that his head spun. After which she cradled his face in her hands and kissed the life out of him, before stepping back and gesticulating in unrestrained fury.</p><p>Then she reached down, took off her shoe, and threw it at his head, oblivious to the small crowd of fascinated bystanders. Ducking the missile, a laughing Emil grabbed her around the waist, pinning her arms to her sides. But Lisette had enough freedom of movement to tug up the skirt of her knee-length shift and attempt to unman her husband.</p><p>Riaz winced, then grinned, knowing the other couple would be okay. The sophisticated and elegant Lisette the rest of the world knew would never cause a scene of such fiery proportions\u2014clearly it was only with the man she loved that she let her shields fall. Just like his Adria would never allow any man but Riaz to reduce her to giggling fits as she wiggled across the bed in an attempt to escape his tickling fingers ... or to hold her when she was at her most vulnerable. \u201cI\u2019m coming, amada. And I\u2019m not leaving without you.\u201d</p> <p>ADRIA knew it was beneath her wolf to have run, but she\u2019d needed space to think. Something Riaz made it impossible to do when he continued to court her with such unyielding focus. After her talk with Martin, she\u2019d walked into her office to find a potted plant waiting for her, big red bow around the pot.</p><p>Queen of the Night. For my empress. Let\u2019s plant it and see if she blooms for us.</p><p>Adria still had the note in her pocket, wrinkled and soft from constant handling.</p><p>Now, as the night closed in on the mountains, a purple-hued twilight, she ran to base camp and shifted into human form, the first watch complete. Dragging on jeans, a long-sleeved T-shirt in plain black, and a gray sweatshirt, she settled down in front of the laz-fire.</p><p>The other wolf on watch up here had his base camp at the opposite end of the route, would run the second watch, but Adria had to be rested for the third in a few hours. Even knowing that, she felt no desire to sleep, her mind a chaos of need and want and impossible choices. She had only tonight before she had to return to the den, and she had no answers to the questions that tormented her.</p><p>When she caught the dark woodsmoke and citrus bite of Riaz\u2019s scent as she moved, she moaned, realizing it was coming from the sweatshirt. She\u2019d thrown it into her pack from where it had been lying on top of the dresser, forgetting she hadn\u2019t worn it since the morning after the midnight meadow ... the night she had given herself to him.</p> <p>Now the mule-headed wolf was holding her to her word, contrary to every rule in the book when it came to mating. Emotions fluctuating between frustrated fury, black despair, and a passion that burned, she pulled the sleeves of the sweatshirt over her fingers and hugged her arms around herself, even knowing it was no way to clear her head.</p><p>Another whisper of that dark, hotly masculine scent ... too strong, too fresh to come from the sweatshirt. Rising to her feet, her heart in her throat, she turned toward the trees. Either she was going mad, or the stubborn lone wolf of a male had come after her. God, but she loved him. \u201cYou have a mate.\u201d It was a desperate reminder to both of them, because her willpower ... it was crumbling to so much dust.</p><p>\u201cI have you.\u201d Rough, determined words. \u201cAn aggravating woman who asked the man I all but stole the Queen of the Night from to babysit it! I\u2019ll probably have to tie Felix up to get her back.\u201d</p><p>Adria shook her head, taking a physical step backward. \u201cDon\u2019t be charming.\u201d Every wall she tried to put up was melting, every shield cracking. \u201cI won\u2019t steal your chance at mating.\u201d It would poison their relationship one corrosive drop at a time.</p><p>Riaz continued to walk toward her, slow and relentless. \u201cI gave it away of my own free will,\u201d he said, his eyes flickering dark gold in the light from the laz-fire. \u201cI love you to distraction, Empress.\u201d</p><p>Her lower lip quivered, her traitorous heart slamming against her ribs. A lone wolf didn\u2019t say those words to just anyone, his devotion a gift he\u2019d give only to the woman he called his own. \u201cRiaz...\u201d</p><p>He gripped her arms when she would\u2019ve taken another step back, dragging her to his chest to hold her tight. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d A husky whisper that was more wolf than man. \u201cDon\u2019t walk away from me again. I couldn\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>Her entire body shuddered as she fought the need inside of her and lost. \u201cYou\u2019ll hate me,\u201d she said, her arms locked around him because she couldn\u2019t not hold him when he was close. \u201cOne day, you\u2019ll hate me.\u201d It was the thing she most feared.</p> <p>Hand fisting in her hair, he pressed his forehead to her own, his eyes night-glow in the dark. \u201cI will love you until the day they put me in the earth.\u201d</p><p>Tears lodged in her throat at the fierceness of his vow. She felt suddenly brittle, as if she was made of the same glass as the tiny figurines Riaz had brought her from Venice. But when she parted her lips to say something\u2014she didn\u2019t know what\u2014he covered them with his own. It was no ravaging, possessive brand, but a slow, sweet seduction, a persuasion.</p><p>Arrogance, force, dominance, she might\u2019ve withstood, but this tenderness...</p><p>\u201cAdria. Adria. Adria.\u201d His voice a rough murmur, he kissed a path down her neck, back up to her mouth. \u201cMy Adria.\u201d</p><p>She was only a woman. A woman who loved this man with the heart of the wolf within. She\u2019d fought so hard, walked away even when it threatened to forever break her, had given him a choice. That he\u2019d chosen her ... no, she wasn\u2019t superhuman enough to resist that, even though deep inside, she knew the choice she was about to make might one day savage her. \u201cI love you,\u201d she said against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t ever walk away from me again.\u201d A demand, his callused hand cupping her face, one of his thumbs brushing possessively over her lips.</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d She kissed him when he would\u2019ve returned the promise, loved him until he forgot what he\u2019d been about to say.</p><p>Chapter 70</p><p>SIENNA SURVIVED ANOTHER meeting of the maternals to crawl into bed under the fluffy sky blue comforter she\u2019d bought online. Patterned with white snowflakes, it felt so soft around her body that she felt as if she were floating on a cloud. Until it was tugged away sometime later, to be replaced by a far heavier, hotter blanket. \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she murmured sleepily.</p><p>Nuzzling kisses along her neck, strong hands caressing the curve of her waist. \u201cAccording to my many spies, you went to bed at eight thirty.\u201d A kiss pressed to her breastbone. \u201cMaternals make your head hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fraction less this time.\u201d Pushing her fingers through the thick glory of his hair, she tugged him up for one of those long, lazy, sexy kisses she adored from her wolf. \u201cWhat did Lucas say?\u201d With anchor detail having wound down as Nikita and Anthony began to shift the anchors into permanent safe houses in earnest, Hawke had gone down to DarkRiver territory with Riley for a meeting to finalize the inter-pack dating rules.</p><p>\u201cThat we should just shoot ourselves in the head now.\u201d Parting her thighs, he settled in between. \u201cI like finding you naked in bed, all sleep-warm and silky.\u201d</p><p>Lips tugging upward at the satisfied statement, she wrapped one leg around his waist. \u201cMy friends gave me some very pretty lingerie as a mating gift.\u201d The intimate present had caused her to blush\u2014making Evie, Maria, and the rest of her lunatic friends howl with laughter. \u201cI\u2019m scared to wear any of it,\u201d she told the wolf in bed with her, \u201cin case you tear the satin and lace to pieces.\u201d</p><p>Nipping at her lower lip, he ran one hand up to pet and fondle her breast. \u201cYou can do a fashion parade later\u2014after I\u2019m suitably sated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArrogant man.\u201d She nibbled on his jaw. \u201cYou woke me up from a very nice dream.\u201d</p><p>A gleam in the wolf blue. \u201cI\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d</p><p>He did. Twice.</p><p>Lying happily exhausted across his chest, she stroked the muscled heat of him and spoke of something that had been on her mind since the confrontation in the forest. \u201cMing\u2019s not going to let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Hawke didn\u2019t sound worried\u2014his voice was that of a predator in hunting mode. Cold. Focused. Without mercy. \u201cWhich is why I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Pushing up on his chest, she looked down into his face, her hair creating a ruby red curtain around them. \u201cExcuse me. I think you must\u2019ve accidentally used the wrong pronoun.\u201d</p><p>The growl that rumbled up out of his chest was loud enough to rattle the water glass on the bedside table. \u201cFine, you can stand in the corner and cheer while I kill him.\u201d</p><p>She burst out laughing, and it was the last thing she\u2019d have ever thought she\u2019d do while talking about Councilor Ming LeBon, telepath and a monster who had turned her childhood into a torture chamber. Unlike the man in bed with her, the one who\u2019d taught her to play, and who treated her like she was a gift he\u2019d been waiting a lifetime to open. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re imagining me with pom-poms,\u201d she said, glimpsing the renewed gleam in his eye, \u201cstop right now.\u201d The effect of her order was somewhat diluted by the laughter that continued to dance in her blood.</p><p>\u201cOr what?\u201d Unrepentant, he tumbled her over onto her back, but in spite of the wickedness in his expression, his next words were deadly serious. \u201cHe\u2019s going to die, Sienna. No one threatens my mate and gets away with it.\u201d</p><p>Ming had been her private nightmare for a long time. That was before she\u2019d been claimed by an alpha wolf who had a ruthless will when it came to protecting those who were his own. Sienna understood that part of him\u2014because it lived in her, too. Anyone who dared hurt Hawke would beg for mercy by the time Sienna was done with them.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to have a plan,\u201d she said, speaking to the wintry-eyed predator that watched her out of the man\u2019s face. \u201cOne so good, Ming\u2019s abilities won\u2019t save him.\u201d The Psy male was a telepath specializing in mental combat, could slice through minds as if he had blades in his hands. \u201cYou and I will have to work as a team and trust certain others to assist\u2014the most critical problem we have to solve is how to dispose of him without impacting the innocent in the Net.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s hand closed around her throat, the possessiveness of his hold echoed by the raw demand of his kiss. \u201cYou are so perfect for me\u201d\u2014hot words against her lips\u2014\u201cI\u2019d steal you if you weren\u2019t already mine.\u201d</p><p>Surrounded by the strength and heat and wildness of him, she had never felt so ready to take on a nightmare. \u201cI think we should call it \u2018Operation Ming Is a Dead Man Walking.\u2019\u201d</p><p>A feral grin on his face, Hawke leaned down until the night-glow of his eyes was only a centimeter away. \u201cHe won\u2019t be walking for long.

Not that he\u2019d allow it, he thought with an inward growl. But he also knew she hid within her a deep vein of wariness, and he hated that she was unsure of his love on any level. Hated it.</p> <p>Patience, he counseled his wolf, but when it came to Adria, he wasn\u2019t patient. Like any lone wolf who had made up his mind about his woman, he was pitiless in his determination. \u201cI never canceled our request for couples quarters and it came through two days ago,\u201d he told her, feet set apart and hands on his hips, ready for the fight she was no doubt about to give him. \u201cWe\u2019re moving.\u201d</p><p>A stiffening of her jaw. \u201cNice to be asked.\u201d</p><p>Hackles paradoxically flattening at the acerbic edge in her voice, he snagged her around the waist and kissed her until she bit at his lip to get some air. Grinning at the sting that told him his empress was back, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll let you pick the sheets.\u201d</p><p>She snarled at him, letting him feel her claws, but, to his surprise, cooperated in the move. Since the anchor detail was now at a low pitch, they had time to do it that day.</p><p>It was around nine at night that Adria gave a very welcome laugh and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a menace.\u201d</p><p>A slow grin spread across his face as he saw she\u2019d found the bear he\u2019d carved sleeping belly-up, a big smile on its face and a bottle of beer in one paw. \u201cHe had a party with the skunk.\u201d</p> <p>Adria put the bear next to the drunken skunk on the shelf he\u2019d put up for her to keep her mechanical puzzles. \u201cYou have more, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He made a noncommittal sound ... and found himself pounced on, as she tried to threaten the answer out of him. Turning the tables, he had her in giggles, and then he had her sighing and arching underneath him, her body molten with welcome. Afterward, she lay with her hand on his heart, his thigh pushed between her own.</p><p>Nipping at her ear, he said, \u201cAre you ever going to admit to the fact you\u2019re a maternal dominant?\u201d It happened once or twice in every generation, a maternal female with such aggressive protective tendencies that she chose to train as a soldier. But nothing, Riaz thought, could change the steely core of compassion that made the maternals who they were, that inherent kindness intertwined with strength reflected in Adria\u2019s every action.</p><p>Her laugh was husky. \u201cWhat kind of lieutenant would you be if you couldn\u2019t figure it out, hmm?\u201d She wrote her initials over his heart, as if marking him. \u201cNell was faster than anyone else to peg me\u2014she wants me in the maternal cabal.\u201d</p><p>Grinning at her description of the power at the heart of the pack, he tucked her hair behind her ear so he could see her face. \u201cInterested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno\u2014it\u2019s like the mafia. Once you\u2019re in, you can never get out.\u201d A smile that danced with mischief, but her next words were thoughtful. \u201cI chose to train as a soldier because it suits my wolf\u2014I\u2019m too aggressive to be a full-time maternal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re great with the submissives.\u201d Ensuring the health of their young was only one aspect of the complex duties undertaken by the maternal females, but it was an important one.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Another design on his chest, this one more aimless. \u201cWorking with pups and juveniles fulfills the other side of my nature. So the setup I currently have is about perfect ... though, I might open a channel with the cabal.\u201d Another wicked grin. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice to get their input on some things, plus since I\u2019ll have a foot in both camps, it\u2019ll be a way to make sure nothing slips between the cracks when it comes to the children.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you think Riley had that in mind all along?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me\u2014even dopey over Mercy, he thinks ten steps ahead.\u201d Stealing a smiling kiss, she settled herself more closely against him and closed her eyes. \u201cGo to sleep. We have to get up early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Empress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Golden Eyes.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, nibbled at her ear again. \u201cSay that in public and you\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019ve gone and dared me. Don\u2019t you know never to do that with a maternal female?\u201d</p><p>Riaz growled playfully at her. He was happy deep in his heart ... but not content, because this laughing woman who had his wolf\u2019s devotion, a woman he adored beyond life itself, expected him to leave her, maybe not today or tomorrow, but one day. It was a hidden shadow in the violet-blue, a darkness he only glimpsed when she thought he wasn\u2019t watching. ... and it eviscerated him.</p><p>He refused to allow her to hurt that way. Fucking refused.</p><p>JUDD was unsurprised to see Aden on the back steps of Xavier\u2019s church a week after the attack on Sonja. \u201cThe anchors in this region are safe,\u201d he told the Arrow. Each and every one had been moved, their locations known only to Nikita and Anthony, no backup files kept either on the Net or outside. But to everyone\u2019s surprise, the telepathic file containing images that could be used for a teleport lock in an emergency, had also been sent to Sascha.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter\u2019s flaw,\u201d Nikita had said during the meeting, staring right across at that daughter, \u201cmakes her the lone individual we can trust absolutely not to use the information to cause harm.\u201d</p><p>Sascha\u2019s reply had been as frank. \u201cI\u2019ll share it with Judd\u2014he\u2019s the only person who\u2019d be able to get to the anchors in an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe decision is yours,\u201d Nikita had said. \u201cAs an E, you have the capability to judge whether or not a former Arrow will use the information to kill.\u201d</p><p>It was, Judd knew, the first time Nikita had ever acknowledged that Sascha wasn\u2019t a failed cardinal, but a powerful one. And because he, Sascha, Lucas, and Hawke all knew that even if the civil war in the Net turned brutal and threatened to engulf the packs, none of them would seek to collapse the Net, to murder indiscriminately, he held the file inside his mind, tucked away in a section that would immediately and automatically degrade if his shields were ever breached.</p><p>Only the people who had been at that meeting, as well as Walker and Sienna, knew that he and Sascha carried the files. The information was too explosive, too dangerous, could make them both targets if it got out. Unless an anchor in the relevant area sent out an emergency distress call, no one would ever know.</p><p>\u201cThe same is being attempted in every region across the world,\u201d Aden now said, \u201cbut the task is massive, and the majority of cities don\u2019t have the resources of two Councilors. For the time being, we\u2019re recommending the anchors move their furniture around in unexpected ways and never go unarmed.\u201d</p><p>No Tk ever used the layout of furniture as a lock\u2014it was too transient. And all teleport-capable Tks had an inbuilt space-sensing ability that meant they would never materialize in solid matter. Unless there was a psychic failure, the teleport would abort at the obstruction. However, if a Tk did \u2019port in, the unfamiliar layout could grant the anchor an extra few seconds in which to run or use a weapon. \u201cIt\u2019s a smart move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenry is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVasic.\u201d A pause. \u201cWe can\u2019t trust him, not after this is done.\u201d</p><p>Judd didn\u2019t misunderstand the warning. \u201cThe children in the Arrow schools,\u201d he said, instead of responding directly to the statement, \u201cwho\u2019s watching out for them?\u201d Even with the darkness swallowing the Net and the Arrows\u2019 attention, Aden would not have forgotten their youngest brethren.</p><p>\u201cThe most stable of us each have a group we monitor.\u201d Aden passed Judd a small black data crystal. \u201cThe names and addresses of the children. If anything happens to us, they are the ones you must protect.\u201d A pause. \u201cTrust it to Walker\u2014he\u2019ll understand and be able to help them better than you or I.\u201d</p><p>Judd put the crystal into the inside pocket of his leather-synth jacket, the act an unspoken promise. \u201cDoes Vasic monitor a group?\u201d Vasic might not feel, but he had a conscience, would never damage a child by abandoning him. That conscience was why the Tk-V hated himself, though he would not put it in those terms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Aden looked out into the night. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t trust himself not to kill if he sees a teacher hurting a child\u2014we can\u2019t yet intervene.

Unlike Ming, Kaleb appears to have no inclination to take a direct hand in the schools.\u201d A long pause. \u201cEven when we seize the reins, total liberation will be impossible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Without the mental discipline forged by his rigid Arrow training, Judd\u2019s abilities might have self-destructed long ago. \u201cBut the process doesn\u2019t have to be cruel.\u201d A young boy\u2019s arm didn\u2019t have to be broken over and over again until he stopped screaming.</p><p>\u201cSome would say such a stance will destroy the foundation of the program.\u201d</p><p>That pain was a state of mind, to be overcome. \u201cAnd perhaps we\u2019ll discover it makes us stronger.\u201d</p><p>Aden didn\u2019t say anything for a long time. \u201cI have to go. There has been an explosion at a Psy research facility in Belgrade.\u201d</p><p>Judd watched the other Arrow disappear into the darkness before rising and entering the church to take the second pew from the back. He felt the slightest brush of air as the Ghost slid into the pew behind him a minute later. \u201cDo you know about Belgrade?\u201d Judd asked while they waited for Father Xavier Perez, the third part of their unexpected triumvirate, to finish speaking with a parishioner in his office.</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d No arrogance, simple fact. \u201cIt was small and is being contained, no fatalities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuck or a lack of planning on the part of the attackers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe latter. The facility is privately funded, and about to begin a critical assessment of the Silence Protocol\u2014somehow, their mission statement leaked into the Net twenty-four hours ago.\u201d</p><p>The fact that any group had gained permission to conduct such a study was momentous, though Judd had a very good idea of how it had been done. As he had about the leak. \u201cPure Psy acted in the heat of the moment.\u201d Judd knew what the Ghost knew about Vasquez, and so he knew this act was out of character. \u201cHenry\u2019s death may have severed the leash that kept Vasquez rational.\u201d He had no doubt his fellow rebel was aware of the ex-Councilor\u2019s demise.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d No concern. \u201cIt\u2019s time, Judd.\u201d</p><p>Yes, the dominoes had begun to fall, unstoppable and inexorable. \u201cIs the violence necessary?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome things need to be broken to become stronger.\u201d</p><p>The Ghost left thirty seconds later, called away by something urgent.</p><p>Sitting alone in the peace of the church, Judd thought of the murders perpetrated by Pure Psy, the violence done tonight, the blood that would be spilled in the future. Instead of reminding the populace of the value of Silence, the aggression was nudging awake long-buried emotions, fear so dark and from so deep in the psyche that not even the most painful conditioning could keep it imprisoned.</p><p>Silence was one crack away from total failure.</p><p>Some things need to be broken to become stronger.</p><p>\u201cHe does not understand friendship,\u201d Judd said to Xavier later, \u201cbut I do.\u201d</p><p>The priest\u2019s dark skin glowed in the light from the candles that were the sole illumination now that he\u2019d turned off the lights. \u201cIs it mercy to end the life of a friend savaged by torment, or is it a sin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are your questions, Xavier. Mine is only this: if he proves too unstable\u201d\u2014willing to extinguish the Net in a rippling wave of endless death\u2014\u201cwill I have the strength to execute a man who is a mirror of who I might\u2019ve been in another life?\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 71</p><p>TWO WEEKS AFTER the attempted assassination of the San Francisco anchor, and a week after the flurry of bombings on a number of Psy research centers and institutions of learning, it felt to Adria as if the entire world was holding its breath. Seven days had passed with no more signs of a civil war that could devastate the planet, but with Judd Lauren having shared what he knew with the senior members of the pack, Adria knew the lull was nothing but the calm in the eye of the storm.</p><p>It was all going to come crashing down, sooner rather than later.</p><p>As a soldier, she worked with her packmates and their allies to prepare the pack and the region\u2014and to some extent, other parts of the world. Through their allies\u2019 connections, and their links with the Human Alliance, the BlackEdge Wolves, the water-based changelings, and less formal relationships with other groups, SnowDancer had a worldwide network that disseminated and shared information in an effort to provide people with the means to protect themselves when the storm blew in.</p><p>However, within herself, where no one could see, she fought a far more heartbreaking war. Her love for Riaz had come to define her. She knew that no matter what the future brought, she would never again feel this glory, never again burn with such vibrant passion and wild tenderness. It brought her incredible joy to live with him, to laugh with him, to fall asleep in his arms ... and every day, she woke up and for a single painful second, wondered if this was the day he\u2019d look at her and realize what he\u2019d given up.</p><p>She\u2019d learned to hide that instinctive dart of pain, and today, as they sat on a bench in Golden Gate Park, watching the people out for a stroll among the flower beds on this piercingly bright fall day, she could almost believe that everything was as it should be, that she was with a man who was meant to be her own and no one else\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to talk to me again?\u201d Riaz demanded, his tone that of a man at the end of his patience.</p><p>It puzzled her. \u201cDidn\u2019t we just have a conversation about the toy dog we saw in that woman\u2019s purse?\u201d The little yapping thing had gone silent when the woman walked past them, its big eyes watching Riaz and Adria as if it expected to be eaten.</p><p>It had made them both laugh.</p><p>But no laughter colored Riaz\u2019s voice when he spoke again. \u201cWe talk about everyday things, inconsequential things.\u201d Eyes of palest brown met hers, shimmering with a film of heated anger ... but his words, they held raw pain. \u201cYou\u2019ve shut me out of your heart, amada, and it\u2019s shredding me to pieces.\u201d</p><p>It made her blood turn to ice, her breath catch until she had to get up, to walk, so she could find air again. He didn\u2019t try to hem her in, her black wolf, didn\u2019t do anything but watch. When she came back down to sit beside him, she gripped the edges of the bench. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d It was instinctive, this withdrawing into herself, a defensive measure she\u2019d learned in the years she\u2019d been with Martin. \u201cI didn\u2019t even realize I was doing it.\u201d Hurting him in the same horrible way she\u2019d once been hurt, something she\u2019d vowed never to do to anyone.</p><p>Devastated, she willed him to believe her. \u201cI never meant to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He reached out to tuck a flyaway strand of her unbound hair behind her ear in a sweet, familiar intimacy. \u201cAnd I\u2019m trying so goddamn hard not to push you, but I need you to be mine. Because I\u2019m yours.\u201d</p><p>Simple. Unguarded. A lone wolf\u2019s heart in her hands.</p><p>Her chest ached. \u201cI\u2019m so afraid,\u201d she whispered, tearing her soul open because his honesty demanded her own. \u201cI try not to be, but I\u2019m so scared you\u2019ll regret letting her go. The fear chokes me up sometimes.\u201d</p><p>Riaz didn\u2019t do anything she would\u2019ve expected from a dominant male. He didn\u2019t take her into his arms and try to convince her it would be all right, didn\u2019t growl or snarl until she relented. Instead, he said, \u201cLook over there.\u201d</p><p>Following his gaze, she found herself looking across the large flower bed in front to focus on an elderly couple who\u2019d been sitting on the bench opposite them for some time. Adria had watched them take snacks out of a small lunchbox, pass each other coffee from a silver thermos, and hold hands. As they were doing now. \u201cThey\u2019re beautiful together.\u201d Their love was age worn and familiar, a groove worn into their lives and hearts. \u201cYou can tell they\u2019re a unit.\u201d Like a mated pair, one wouldn\u2019t long survive the other.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not changeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman,\u201d she said. \u201cMust be a hundred and twenty-five at least.\u201d Fit and healthy, though they\u2019d allowed their hair to turn snow white, their bodies to soften. Age sat on them with the warmest elegance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s their hundredth anniversary today,\u201d Riaz said to her surprise. \u201cSo they decided to recreate their first date.\u201d</p><p>Wonder bloomed within her. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>A small smile curved his lips, brought that light into his eyes she so adored. \u201cI was eavesdropping when the park was a little quieter. The wind carried their words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so romantic,\u201d she said, her face stretching from the depth of her smile. Maybe one day, it would be her and Riaz on this bench, a hundred years from now.</p><p>The dream was one she wanted with her every breath ... and one, she understood in a moment of crystal clarity, that she had the power to make come true. As she had the power to destroy it, burying it under the cold darkness of fear until nothing remained.</p><p>The realization wiped everything else aside to leave her with a single blinding truth: their future had never been, and was never going to be, Riaz\u2019s choice alone. He\u2019d fought so hard for her, her lone wolf, and she would fight for him, too, to the last beat of her heart. Never again would she step gracefully aside. Forget about setting something free if you loved it\u2014she would goddamn hold on to her man. Her wolf growled in agreement, its bruised spirit infused with steel, a door crashing open inside her that she hadn\u2019t even been aware was locked shut.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not changeling, Adria.\u201d</p><p>Her determination a hot pulse in her skin, she turned to look at him, his profile strong. \u201cI know.\u201d It was a frustrated statement, because all she wanted to do was touch her black wolf, hold him, make it up to him for having been such an idiot for so long. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiaz.\u201d</p><p>He slipped his hand to her nape, squeezed. \u201cLook.\u201d</p> <p>Still scowling, she glanced up to see the man lean over to kiss his wife before he turned on the tiny music player he\u2019d put on the bench. He held out his hand and she flowed into his arms. The song was an old one, from the time of their youth, and while their feet moved a little slower than they might have on that long-ago first date, the love between them was so luminous, it made every single person around them halt, stop breathing.</p><p>Adria, too, didn\u2019t take her eyes off the couple until they finished dancing and packed up their things to walk away, hand in hand. \u201cThat\u2019s...\u201d She had no words for the sheer beauty of what she\u2019d seen.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not changeling,\u201d Riaz said again. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the mating bond. Whatever they feel for one another can\u2019t be what one mate-bonded changeling feels for another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d She swiveled to face him, incensed that he\u2019d try to lessen the wonder of what they\u2019d just witnessed. \u201cI dare anyone pry them apart.\u201d</p><p>Riaz said nothing, his eyes a brilliant dark gold that glowed.</p> <p>And she heard what she\u2019d said, what he\u2019d said. \u201cWe\u2019re not human,\u201d she whispered, hope an incandescent burst of sunshine in her blood.</p><p>This time, he did take her into his arms, into his lap, uncaring of who might be watching. \u201cDoes that mean we love any less?\u201d Rough words from the heart of the wolf.</p><p>Shaking her head, she wrapped her arms around his neck and held him tight. \u201cI love you to madness.\u201d She pulled back, his face cupped in her hands, giving him the words, the courtship, he\u2019d given her. \u201cUntil I wake up early some days just to watch you sleep, until it hurts to be separated from you for even a day, until I steal your sweatshirts so I can rub my face against your scent.\u201d</p><p>His arms squeezed her till she knew she\u2019d carry bruises, but she didn\u2019t care. When he would\u2019ve spoken, she stopped him with a kiss, fisting her hand in his hair. \u201cNo more chances, Golden Eyes. You\u2019re mine and I\u2019ll draw blood to enforce my claim.\u201d She didn\u2019t care if a hundred women claimed rights\u2014Riaz belonged to Adria and she was keeping him. \u201cI\u2019m through with being reasonable and accommodating and stupid enough to ever let you go. So get ready to tangle with a very possessive dominant female who considers you hers.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile, the eyes of the wolf looking out at her. \u201cI thought you\u2019d never say that.\u201d He nipped at her jaw, his wolf rubbing up against her own with an affection that made her want to shift and play with him through the flower beds. \u201cYou\u2019re my one and only, too, but you already know that.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she thought with a joyful laugh, she did. It was in his every touch, every glance, every caress, the pulse of it arcing through her bloodstream. They might never have the mating bond, but they\u2019d created their own bond, and she dared anyone to break the wild beauty of it.</p> <p>Then he spoke again and the joy splintered into a near-unbearable tenderness. \u201cHeart of my heart, that\u2019s who you are, Adria Morgan. Chosen and forever.\u201d Picking her hand off his cheek, he pressed a lingering kiss to the palm before placing it over the strong, steady rhythm of that very organ. \u201cWolf and man, you own every part of me.\u201d</p><p>Turning her hand to curl her fingers around his own, this lone wolf who wore his love with such pride, unafraid to show his vulnerability, she whispered, \u201cHeart of my heart ... my Riaz. Chosen and forever.\u201d Smile tremulous, she traced his lips with her fingertips and surrendered the final vestiges of her own defenses. \u201cAnd we\u2019re even ... because you own every part of me, too.\u201d</p><p>His mouth moved under her touch, his smile creasing his cheeks. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to take good care of our gifts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best.\u201d Laughter bubbled inside her, the sheer depth of her happiness seeking an outlet. \u201cWe need to dance.\u201d</p><p>A raised eyebrow.</p><p>Passion melding with tenderness, she kissed him until his heart thundered, until he grinned in wolfish delight and asked her to do it again. \u201cSo,\u201d she said after granting his wish, \u201cwe can do it on our hundredth anniversary.\u201d</p><p>Her black wolf smiled, rose ... and spun her out in an outrageous curve before spinning her into his arms again, her back to his chest. \u201cWhere you belong,\u201d he said, pressing a kiss to her pulse.</p><p>Yes.</p> <p>Retrieval</p><p>KALEB HAD FOUND the first clue eight months ago, a psychic tracker he\u2019d constructed and released into the Net. Of the thousands he\u2019d sent out, only one had returned to him. It had been old and crumbling, but it had carried a viable information payload.</p><p>A name.</p><p>A direction.</p><p>It had taken him months of painstaking tracking through the Net to pick up the trail. The last weeks had required hours of intense concentration every single day, the blind alleys and shields formed to confuse a pursuer having had years to mature and morph until they created a twisted psychic jungle. Enough to halt even the most highly trained operative. But ... no one had expected Kaleb to come hunting.</p><p>No one knew they had taken what belonged to him.</p><p>No one alive anyway.</p><p>Because he\u2019d made it through, and now stood silent and motionless, certain he was so close to his target that he was in danger of setting off multiple psychic trip wires.</p><p>Touching the NetMind and the DarkMind, the latter identity still stronger than the former, he asked them to tell him what they saw. His mind filled with an overlay of fine lines across the star-studded skies of the Net. Those were the \u201cblood vessels\u201d of the network, conduits for the rapid transfer of information. He disregarded them to focus on the finer red lines below\u2014psychic alerts someone had rigged in a section of the Net that appeared uninhabited.</p><p>Skirting the trip wires with the flawless mental grace of a cardinal with lethal combat training, he continued toward his target. There were more trip wires, more traps, until he glimpsed the minds of the guards at last. But they didn\u2019t see him. Cloaked in psychic invisibility, his shields impenetrable, he passed right by them. To find himself in front of the doors of a locked psychic vault disguised as dead space. It had been constructed by a telepath of considerable skill, its effect to create a prison around a particular mind, ensuring no trace of that mind leaked out into the Net.</p><p>Kaleb had waited too long to make a mistake now. He circled around the vault to check for hidden alarms that would alert the ones who monitored it. He found five. Dismantling them took four hours of unremitting concentration. Only when he was certain no other alarms remained, did he \u201cbreak\u201d the psychic seal of the vault and step inside. He stayed two seconds, just long enough to take a telepathic imprint of the mind within.</p><p>Dropping out of the Net after leaving the guarded and rigged area with the careful stealth he\u2019d used to enter it, he teleported at almost the same instant, using the imprint of that imprisoned mind as a telekinetic lock. This was the rarest possible method of getting a lock, because to get it, you had to rip apart the shields of the mind being used as a lock, effectively laying the brain open\u2014but the mind he\u2019d seen in the vault had already been stripped, its shields destroyed.</p><p>Completing the teleport, he found himself in a small white cell, the walls padded, the glare from the single ceiling lamp cutting. No windows. No natural light.</p><p>He ignored the irrelevant factors. Only one thing mattered.</p><p>He\u2019d found her. </p> </body></html>"]
