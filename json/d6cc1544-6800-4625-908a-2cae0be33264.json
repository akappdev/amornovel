Would this be the time that I found her, the enchantress that had graced my thoughts and dreams for two centuries? Or would I fail again, only to be a step behind the woman that had eluded me yet again?</p><p>Sliding out of the car, I quietly closed the door behind me. Pushing through the large wooden doors, my eyes efficiently scanned the restaurant deciding where the best vantage point would be to watch for her. Quickly calculating my options, I made the decision that the bar area would be a favorable place to observe the various humans that would come and go as the night progressed. I chose a small table in the corner where I had an unobstructed view of the small restaurant, yet could remain relatively hidden. I folded my large frame into one of the chairs, resting my arms on the wooden table.</p><p>I waited for her as I had for the last 200 years.</p><p>Hours slowly passed, yet only my fingers betrayed my growing irritation as they absently picked at the label on the bottle of beer I had ordered in my charade to appear human. I had all but given up hope when my attention was drawn to two women entering the bar, approaching a table and greeting another small woman with embraces. The first woman was tall with long brown hair, dressed in a bright pink dress that screamed out for attention. She was brassy and loud, her mannerisms flighty. Feeling my lip curl in disgust, I let my eyes drift to the second woman and it was if time stopped for me. Seeing her standing there made everything except her vanish around me: the inane chatter, the offensive smell of human food, the smell of blood. Nothing else mattered except this woman.</p> <p>My fated.</p><p>She was shorter than the other woman, small-boned and willowy. Her dark, reddish-blond hair was a tumble of glossy waves over her bare, tanned shoulders. Her small, oval face had high cheekbones and finely arched brows. I knew without seeing them that her eyes would be a deep, luminous green. A sleeveless black dress hugged the curves of her full breasts and shapely hips, accentuating her long and lean legs.</p><p>My primal instincts threatened to take over as my predatory gaze lingered on her body. I wanted to take her, possess every part of her. Every fiber of my being wanted to walk to her and sweep her away to keep her for myself, regardless if she was willing or not. Clenching my jaw, I let out a ragged breath. I could not scare her after waiting centuries to find her. I had to rely on my patience and wait, like a lion watching its prey. The promise of what she would be to me would make my suffering tolerable.</p><p>Silently observing her, it was apparent she seemed uncomfortable as she went through the motions of eating and talking with her companions. It was only after a few glasses of wine that she began to relax, her occasional laughter drifting over the din of the restaurant and the gentle sound was like a soothing balm to my restless soul. I had lost count of the times that I had resisted the urge to go to her, regardless of the consequences. The instinctual urge to have her was all-consuming.</p><p>A DJ started playing loud music in the bar, causing humans to slowly fill the small dance floor. My eyes were only focused on her as she waved off her friends' attempts to pull her on the dance floor with them. She waved them off with a laugh, pointing to the door that led to the patio. I calculated the risks of approaching her now or taking the chance and waiting for her on the beach below the restaurant.</p> <p>Tossing money on the table, I walked at an almost inhuman speed to the door and blurred down the stairs to the beach. I moved a safe distance from the steps and prayed silently to Odin that I had made the correct choice.</p><p>Only a few moments had passed when I heard her soft footsteps on the stairs, stopping as she moved gracefully onto the sand. She was still for a moment, a smile gracing her lips. Hesitantly, I began walking towards her, freezing in place when a peal of laughter erupted from her. It was impossible for me to walk away from her now. She was like a siren, calling me to her. I resumed my approach, my feet silent and cautious.</p><p>\"May I ask what is so funny?\"</p><p>She startled, her heart race increasing as she spun to face me. She was ethereally beautiful, her reddish-blond hair even darker and gleaming in the moonlight, framing her delicate face. The eyes that had haunted me thousands of times in my mind were dark green and large, shadowed with a fringe of thick eyelashes. Her cheeks were flushed pink over her prominent cheekbones and her pouty lips were parted in surprise. If possible, she was more beautiful than she appeared in my vision.</p><p>A mixture of relief and euphoria flooded over me and threatened to bring me to my knees in front of her. After centuries alone, I had found her. My solitary goal was to now to convince her to remain by my side.</p><p>\"N-nothing,\" she stuttered, her breath uneven as she spoke. \"It's sort of an inside joke about my friends.\"</p> <p>\"Ah. A joke.\" I moved to stand close enough to her so that our arms touched, electricity sparking between us. The animalistic urge to take her roared loudly inside of me, begging for release. I swallowed roughly and struggled to maintain my faltering self-control.</p><p>She had felt the surge as well. I watched as her fingers brushed absently against her arm. I was only briefly taken aback when I heard her thoughts float through my mind, wondering if she was crazy or if she'd had too much to drink when she felt the energy pass between us. She thought it would make more sense if she was crazy.</p><p>Hearing her mental voice in my mind made my vision complete. I knew her voice would 'call to me', yet I had no comprehension as to what that meant until this moment. She would not be pleased to know that I had access to her thoughts. This development could be added to my list of unpleasant things that I would eventually have to explain to her.</p><p>Turning my head to look down at her, I was entertained as she continued her inner musings. Her eyes were searching my face, her thoughts filled with confusion. She was comparing me to a memory in her mind. She thought my face was handsome, noting the almost iridescent quality of my skin in the moonlight. Her heart was still thumping wildly as she openly admired me, her thoughts varying from thinking she was out of her league with me to making attempts to try to figure out why she couldn't read me.</p><p>It was imperative that I divert her thoughts for the moment. She was much more perceptive than most humans and it was much too early to be forced to play my hand.</p><p>\"I should introduce myself. I am Stefan Lifsten. And you are?\" I inclined my head, extending my hand to her in greeting. Shaking, she placed her tiny hand in mine and the silky warmth heated the coolness of my skin. Another spark passed between us when our hands met. Her mind wandered off to consider that it may not be a good sign that her panties wanted to disappear into the night from just a touch.</p><p>She was absolutely intriguing.</p><p>\"I'm Josephine Anderson. Everyone calls me Josie but you can call me whatever you want...\" Her soft voice faltered, having almost a musical quality to it. She was irritated with herself for babbling, cursing herself for her 'verbal diarrhea' and wondering if she could do anything to make herself seem more of an idiot.</p> <p>\"Josephine. It is my pleasure to meet you.\" I lowered my mouth to her hand, brushing it lightly with my lips. My eyes rolled back as I was bombarded with the allure of her blood pulsing through her veins, the soft heat of her fragrant skin and the sweet bouquet of her arousal flooding my nose. It took every bit of self-control I possessed to pull my lips from her skin to observe her again. She took a deep breath and glanced in the direction of the bar, her mind focused on trying to calm herself before she blurted something else out embarrassing.</p><p>Concentrating on keeping my composure, I longed to explain to her that nothing would separate me from her again. I would kill for her and procure any object she desired, no matter the cost or the method required to obtain it.</p><p>My life was no longer my own. This beautiful, strange human woman held the fate of my existence in her hands.</p><p>I would die a thousand deaths for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His long fingers twitched against mine as he fought not to touch me. He didn't move as I straddled his hips and let my breasts graze seductively against his cool chest. At any time he could have easily broken away from my tentative hold. He remained still, his jaw tight as my lips brushed against the corner of his mouth.</p><p>\"Please. I want to do this,\" I begged, gently squeezing his hands and slowly nibbling my teeth against the soft skin of his neck.</p><p>His low growl of approval vibrated against me as my lips blazed a trail down his throat and across his collarbone. I released his hands and placed them beside his legs, giving him a look that warned him to keep them there. He sat motionless, still watching every move I made with his piercing blue eyes.</p><p>Moving to stand between his legs, I leaned over to palm his thighs and whispered quietly against his ear. \"Lean back.\"</p> <p>He moved his hands and braced them behind him. I traced my eyes over every inch of his long hard body, sweeping across his sculpted chest, down his finely muscled arms and finally stopping to rest on his toned abdomen.</p><p>He was magnificent. And he was completely mine.</p><p>Sinking to my knees, I swirled my tongue over his hip and dragged my lips across his stomach, gently kissing the head of his cock.</p><p>\"Josephine,\" he groaned.</p><p>My eyes flickered up, watching as his blond head fell back against his shoulders and his fingers dug into the covers behind him. His broad chest was heaving with panting breaths. Drunk with power, I licked my lips and sank my mouth down over his cock, my hands still gripping his thighs.</p> <p>His hips involuntarily thrust against me as my lips moved over him, pulling him deeper and faster inside of my mouth. I groaned around him as I felt him twitch against my lips.</p><p>\"Nog! Enough!\" He growled deeply through gritted teeth. \"Vackra, I do not want to come this way.\"</p><p>Releasing him with a light pop, I let him fall from my mouth. Pushing lightly against his chest and forcing him back against the bed, I crawled slowly up the length of his body. Every inch of our skin was touching as I pressed against him. \"Do you want to be inside of me when you come?\"</p><p>He swallowed hard, his throat bobbing. \"Yes.\"</p><p>\"Do you want to make me come too?\" I asked, nuzzling my nose against his cheek.</p><p>\"Josephine....\"</p> <p>\"Answer me. Do you want to touch me?\" I brushed my lips against his as I spoke. His mouth parted and his tongue flickered out to lick across his lower lip. I knew all too well what that tongue was capable of and I'd had enough of trying to control him. I wanted to lose myself in him and everything he had to offer.</p><p>\"More than I can tell you. Jag vill begrava min kuk i dig. Jag vill att du ber f?r mig att sluta,\" He muttered softly as he switched to speak in his native tongue.</p><p>Instead of kissing me, he opened his mind to me, revealing exactly what he wanted to do in explicit detail. He wanted to devour every part of me, bury himself inside of me until I screamed his name and begged for him to stop.</p><p>\"Don't just show me what you want to do to me with your mind. Do it,\" I whispered in challenge.</p><p>His large hands blurred to cup each side of my face, capturing my mouth in a kiss that was as raw and unapologetic as it was seductive. In a blur, he had flipped me on my back on the bed, his pale body looming over me.</p><p>\"Josie!\" I heard my name being called from a distance. The offending voice wasn't his, it was garbled and distorted. Choosing to ignore it, I focused back on him. My lips sought his again, his smile brief as our lips reconnected, wet and filled with need.</p><p>I felt a hand grasp my shoulder, slightly shaking me. He began to disappear around me, fading away before my eyes. I already mourned the loss of his mouth against mine and my skin cried out for him.</p><p>\"Josie, wake up.\" The insistent voice was back and was much clearer this time.</p> <p>\"No, come back. Don't leave me,\" I murmured, frantically grasping at his fading form.</p><p>\"I will see you again soon, vackra.\" With those parting words, he completely disappeared.</p><p>My eyes flew open and I sat straight up with a strangled gasp and I felt as if my heart was going to pound out of my chest. Running my hands through my hair, my eyes darted around the room in search of him. I was disappointed to see my neighbor sitting on the edge of my bed, her face twisted in concern as she watched me hesitantly.</p><p>\"Josie, you scared the crap outta me. Are you okay?\" Georgia asked quietly. She leaned over to place her hand on my trembling arm.</p><p>\"Uh, yeah. Give me a sec,\" I stammered. I rubbed my face with my hands and tried to sort out my jumbled thoughts. I'd dreamed of him again. He was a beautiful, perfect fragment of my imagination.</p><p>When my head cleared, I focused my attention back on Georgia. She was still watching me nervously from her perch at the end of my bed.</p><p>\"What are you doing here?\" I snapped at her. She flinched at my tone and I felt horrible that I was taking my frustration out on her. I wasn't used to having such vivid dreams. Especially the kind I'd been having lately. \"Shit, I didn't mean to snap. I'm still not awake.\"</p><p>\"Pfft, I've had worse. You should meet my sister.\" She waved me off and her face relaxed into a smile. \"I was stopping by to see if you wanted to go out tonight. Anna called me earlier and she wants to meet us at the Echo Beach Club. I think she misses us.\"</p><p>Georgia Turner was a fellow American who had relocated to live in Bali to run a local charity, a fireball of a woman from the state of Louisiana. She was in her late thirties, a tall brunette with dark blue eyes. She had a light southern drawl to her speech and was blessed with a wicked sense of humor. She was also extremely perceptive and had an uncanny way of seeing through you with her sharp, observant eyes.</p><p>\"Georgia, I don't know-\" I began, tucking a piece of my long, reddish-blond hair behind my ear. It was a waste of time arguing with her because Georgia didn't take no for an answer. I could already feel the smugness emanating from her. She knew she'd won and I knew I'd be going out tonight.</p><p>\"No if's, ands or buts,\" Georgia said as she cut me off. She turned smoothly on her heel and headed down the hallway. \"Now get your behind into gear before I need to kick it.\" I watched Georgia's ponytail bobbing as she bounced away.</p><p>\"And I'll be back at eight. Be ready,\" She yelled over her shoulder as if an afterthought.</p><p>Glancing at my watch, I let out a groan when I noticed it was already almost seven. I guess it was time to get my ass into gear since Georgia wouldn't be late.</p><p>Humming to myself, I dabbed on lip gloss and pivoted in the mirror, giving my tight black wrap dress and wedge sandals a silent nod of approval. I walked down the hall into the living room and plopped down on the couch to wait for Georgia. Closing my eyes, I took in a calming breath, concentrating on getting my mental shields in place. It had been a while since I'd been in a crowd of people and unless I was prepared, it was going to be a long night for me.</p><p>I avoided going out a lot because of my 'gift'. And most days my 'gift' of being a psychic empath seemed to be more of a curse than a blessing. It gave me a front row seat to see the intimate details into the lives of strangers and their emotions. I told very few people about my abilities. I'd learned the hard way that most people either viewed me as a shiny new toy to play with or chose to avoid me at all costs.</p><p>\"Josie!\" Georgia's irritated voice brought me back to reality, snapping me out of my musings. \"I've been knocking for two minutes. C'mon already, Anna's waiting for us. Let's roll, girl.\"</p><p>Startled by her loud arrival, I'd been so focused on shielding that I hadn't heard Georgia knocking or been able to see her arrive. She was hard to block, her future and emotions almost screamed out for my attention. I had to stay on guard with Georgia. It would only take one small slip on my part for her to figure out my abilities.</p><p>\"Sorry, Georgia. I'm just out of it today,\" I said. I reached over to grab my purse and tried my best to push down my guilty conscience, offering her a small smile of apology.</p><p>\"We can chat in the car. I didn't work this long getting ready to stand around in your house. C'mon,\" Georgia teased as she swept her arm down her body. Georgia's hair hung down her back in a sleek, shiny sheet and her hot pink, silk mini-dress left little to the imagination. She was what Americans termed 'a cougar.' She happily flaunted her sexuality and viewed men as an entertaining challenge. Once she'd had her fun, she moved on to the next. There were days that I envied her nonchalance when it came to men and relationships.</p><p>\"Yeah, yeah,\" I muttered as I followed Georgia outside to her car, getting in the passenger seat and reaching behind me to grab the seat belt. I was still struggling to fasten it when she gunned the engine and roared down my driveway. Georgia drove like she was chasing the last living man on earth or the last bottle of wine on the island. Or both.</p><p>\"Josie, are you excited about tonight?\" Georgia asked. I shot her a look out of the corner of my eye and smiled as I watched her bounce in the seat excitedly. \"I just know tonight is going to be a night to remember. Something big is going to happen, Josie. I can feel it!\"</p><p>\"And what makes tonight so special?\" I questioned. I found it ironic that this was coming from the non-psychic cougar that made this same prediction every time we went out. And to date, nothing exciting had ever happened.</p><p>\"I can't put my finger on it, Josie. Maybe we can find you a man tonight. You've been here way too long with no lovin',\" Georgia drawled, glancing over at me with a wicked smile before focusing back on the road.</p><p>\"Georgia, you know I don't date. Men and I aren't a good mix,\" I huffed, folding my arms across my chest. It wasn't a lie, I didn't date. I avoided men and had given up on the idea of having a relationship a long time ago. It was yet another perk of being a psychic empath.</p><p>\"Who said anything about dating? I'm merely suggesting that you have a little fun with no strings attached,\" Georgia replied lightly. \"You're gorgeous, Josie. You could have any man you wanted.\"</p><p>Georgia's words were ironic. I didn't consider myself 'gorgeous' but I was pretty. My long hair was reddish-blond and wavy and I was curvy in all the right places. I'd never had any problem attracting the unwanted attention of men. I just didn't want it.</p><p>\"Whatever. Keep dreaming, cougar,\" I replied. I mentally started the countdown until she started her tirade. 3, 2...</p><p>\"I told you that I'm much too young to be a cougar. I'm a puma.\" Georgia raised an eyebrow and quickly shot me a dirty look. \"Stop trying to change the subject, Josie. I'm just worried about you, sweetie. You seem so lonely.\"</p><p>Hot tears pricked at the back of my eyes as I focused out the window for a moment. \"I'm fine, Georgia. Honest.\"</p><p>\"That's where I beg to differ. You've been here for a year and Anna and I are your only friends. You don't date, you spend days alone writing and doing yoga. It's not good to shut yourself off from everything.\"</p><p>Georgia had taken it upon herself to be my unofficial foster mom after she found out I'd been orphaned. My adoptive parents had both died in a car accident four years ago, leaving me with no family. I'd searched extensively for my birth parents but I'd hit a dead end when I found the records had been sealed.</p><p>\"I've managed to make it 28 years being a loner, Georgia. Let's change the subject, please,\" I said crossly.</p><p>\"You're in luck, sweetheart. We're here,\" Georgia said as she pulled into a parking spot near the front of the restaurant. We were walking towards the door when she turned to look at me mischievously. \"Josie, let's talk about that fling I think you need to have before we go in.\"</p><p>\"Georgia. Let's have dinner, some drinks and some fun,\" I said sharply, cutting her off before she started giving me more relationship advice. I gave her a small shove through the heavy wood doors of the restaurant. \"That's more than enough for me.\"</p><p>\"Spoiled sport.\" Georgia pouted as her eyes scanned the room. She spotted Anna across the restaurant, waiting for us at a table that was close to the bar and had a fantastic view of the beach. Georgia waved her arm wildly to catch her attention and we crossed the restaurant to join her.</p><p>\"Anna!\" Georgia squealed, leaning over and pulling her up into a tight hug. Anna rolled her eyes at me over Georgia's shoulder as she halfheartedly hugged her back.</p><p>\"Georgia, I keep forgetting how demure you are,\" Anna deadpanned. I coughed and focused on a piece of non-existent piece of lint on my dress so I didn't laugh at the obvious sarcasm in her voice.</p><p>Anna Wilson was a tiny, vivacious woman in her early thirties. She had a tumble of shoulder length brown curls, clever brown eyes and had zero tolerance for bullshit. She was a successful realtor in Bali, also a fellow American that originally hailed from the east coast. Anna was the one friend here that knew of my ability and had accepted me with a shoulder shrug and never mentioned it again.</p><p>\"Come here and give me a hug, bitch,\" Anna laughed, extracting herself from Georgia's embrace to tug me in for a brief hug. \"Don't get any ideas about the two of us just because I'm happy to see you.\"</p><p>Laughing at Anna's snark, we sat down at the table and I grabbed a menu. As I flipped through the pages, I felt like someone was intently watching our table. Quickly glancing around the restaurant, I lowered my shields to focus on the crowd. I was instantly bombarded with emotions that ranged from desire, happiness, and angst. Unable to find anyone that had plans on approaching our table, I raised my shields back into place and blamed my nerves on the busy crowd.</p><p>The conversation was light and fun, partially due to numerous glasses of wine I consumed during dinner. I felt myself start to relax when I realized my shields were better than I thought they would be. Was the alcohol making me brave or was I underestimating myself? I had a feeling it was the alcohol.</p><p>We'd just finished dinner when a DJ started playing music in the bar area. Georgia and Anna pleaded and tried to drag me onto the dance floor with them. I quickly waved them off and motioned to the patio across the room. I walked slowly to the door and stepped out onto the patio, glancing back over my shoulder to watch Georgia as she swayed in time to the music with a dark haired man, not wasting any time in snagging herself a dance partner. Anna was sitting at the bar, deep in conversation with the bartender. I slipped out the door, happy that I wouldn't be missed for a few minutes since they were both occupied.</p><p>Smiling to myself, I stepped carefully down the stairs to the beach below and watched as the waves crashed onto the beach. I was actually glad that I'd let Georgia talk me into coming out tonight. There was really no chance I could have convinced Georgia I didn't want to anyway. She would have stomped in, dressing and physically hauling me out if necessary. I let out a loud laugh at the mental image, the sound echoing through the balmy night air.</p><p>\"May I ask what is so funny?\"</p><p>Startled by the deep, smooth accented voice, I whirled around to see a man swaggering towards me. He was well over six feet tall and solidly built with blond, Nordic good looks. His face was finely sculpted, with sparkling eyes blue like the ocean. I had the strangest feeling of deja vu wash over me as I stared at him. He looked exactly like the man from my dreams.</p><p>It couldn't be possible.</p><p>\"N-nothing really,\" I stuttered, my breath coming out in a shudder. \"It's sort of an inside joke about my friends inside.\"</p><p>\"Ah. A joke.\" The blond man moved to stand close enough to me so that our arms were touching. I'd obviously had too much wine to drink, since I could have sworn there was some sort of spark that passed between us when our skin brushed against each other. I absently rubbed my fingers over my arm, wondering if I'd finally lost my mind or if this was just another dream that I'd be waking up from soon.</p><p>Let's face it, men that looked like he did just didn't just appear on a beach and approach me every day. In fact, the only time I'd ever seen a man that looked like him was in my dreams. I could feel my heart start to race when I started to notice the similarities between him and my fantasy man. They shared the same blond hair and chiseled face with skin that almost glowed iridescently. He was almost too perfect to be real, a work of impossible masculine beauty.</p><p>I was way out of my league with him. Hell, we weren't even in the same ballpark.</p><p>Unsure how to proceed, I lowered my shield to try to see his future or feel his emotions and gasped when I couldn't do either. He was a void, his presence a gentle hum in my mind. The hair raised on the back of my neck as my brain worked overtime trying to figure out why I couldn't read him.</p><p>His deep voice brought me out of my thoughts as he extended his large hand to me, inclining his head slightly. \"I should introduce myself. I am Stefan Lifsten. And you are?\"</p><p>Hesitantly I placed my much smaller hand in his and immediately noticed the cool, silky hardness of his skin. I was startled at the electricity that jolted between us when his large hand enveloped mine. Shivers of excitement shot through my body and a slow, long forgotten burn ignited between my legs. I wasn't sure if it was a good sign that the simple touch of his hand made my panties want to disappear into the night.</p><p>\"I'm Josephine Anderson. Everyone calls me Josie but you can call me whatever you want.....\" I said nervously, my cheeks burning with embarrassment at my mindless chatter. I could now add verbal diarrhea to my mental checklist of the many reasons why I knew this man was out of my league.</p><p>\"Josephine. It is my pleasure to meet you.\" Stefan lowered his mouth to my hand and brushed it lightly with his lips. My skin throbbed where his mouth had touched my skin, a sensation I'd never experienced before. I drew in a shaky breath and glanced in the direction of the bar. I was trying to focus on the faint sounds of music to calm down before I made a bigger idiot out of myself.</p><p>\"Would you like go inside and dance with me, Josephine?\" Stefan asked. A beautiful smile slowly broke across his face, causing fine lines to crinkle around his eyes.</p><p>Stunned into silence by his question, my lips parted in surprise as I stared back at him. Dance?!? He wants to dance with me? Would my poor body be able to handle it if I was wrapped in his arms, or would I just spontaneously combust from the sensation? I didn't know for sure, but it was a chance I was willing to take.</p><p>\"Sure.\" I nodded anxiously. Inwardly groaning at my lack of conversational skills, his compelling presence had reduced me to either nervous babbling or to one answer responses.</p><p>\"Shall we go?\" Stefan asked. He placed his large hand on my lower back and gently nudged me towards the steps that led back into the bar. We slowly climbed them together, the music getting louder as we approached the patio. He opened the door for me and I blinked as we reentered the darkened bar area, my eyes taking a moment to adjust to the light after the darkness of the beach.</p><p>\"Let me get you a drink before I take you up on the dance you promised me,\" Stefan said and waggled his eyebrows. He led me towards the bar and pulled out a stool for me. \"What would you like?\"</p><p>A few dirty thoughts of what I'd like to do to him crossed my mind as I sat down, swiveling on the stool to face him. \"A glass of red wine sounds great.\"</p><p>When he stepped away and motioned for the bartender, I was finally able to get a good look at him as he leaned across the bar to order my drink. His hair was golden blond and thick with long layers that swept across his forehead. He had high cheekbones and his brows arched over expressive sea blue eyes. His square jaw was strong with a slight cleft in his chin. The black t-shirt he was wearing strained tightly against his broad chest, hugging the lean muscles of his long arms. His faded jeans rode low on his narrow hips and clung to his long, powerful legs.</p><p>I watched as he slowly turned and sauntered back towards me, a wry grin on his face. He placed my glass of wine in front of me and sat down. His large frame made the bar stool look much too small and his long legs stretched to brush against mine. Swallowing the groan that threatened to escape, I gingerly picked up the glass and took a large drink of wine.</p><p>\"Thanks. You're not drinking anything?\"</p><p>He chuckled and leaned closer to me. His sparkling eyes flickered over my face and he swallowed tightly. \"No, I am fine for now.\"</p><p>My fingers tapped nervously against the polished wood of the bar and I was surprised when Stefan's large hand covered mine, weaving our fingers together. Our eyes met with a force that made me feel like I was burning alive from the inside out. He smiled and reached over to push a curl away from my face, his long fingers brushing down the side of my face in a gentle caress that left my skin tingling.</p><p>\"Josie!\"</p><p>I broke away from his gaze and watched with apprehension as Georgia and Anna made their way over to us across the crowded bar, their eyes both widening in shock as they took in my companion at the bar.</p><p>Georgia raised both eyebrows at me. \"We were just getting ready to look for you. I can see you've been busy.\"</p><p>Anna moved to stand by Georgia with a drink in her hand, her eyes boldly sweeping over Stefan with obvious appreciation. She gave me an exaggerated nod, winking in approval. She leaned towards me and attempted to whisper, her loud voice carrying so that it was audible over the music. \"Good catch, Josie.\"</p><p>Mortified, my eyes darted to Stefan's face to gauge his reaction. His mouth was arranged in a smug smirk and he seemed unaffected by their stares and comments, his eyes softening as they met mine. He raised an eyebrow slightly, jutting his chin towards Anna and Georgia to remind me that we weren't alone.</p><p>\"Uh, yeah. Georgia and Anna, this is Stefan Lifsten. Stefan, these are my friends Georgia and Anna,\" I managed a feeble introduction. My stomach churned uneasily as I glanced between Stefan and my friends.</p><p>\"It is my pleasure to meet you both.\" Stefan stood and inclined his blond head slightly in greeting. He was still holding my hand tightly and his cool grip was strangely reassuring. Georgia narrowed her eyes and peered at our joined hands, her head swiveling to look at Anna in disbelief. Anna gave her a confused shrug and busied herself with her drink.</p><p>Georgia's head spun back around and refocused her attention on me, a forced smile on her face. She glanced at her watch and stared at me pointedly. \"Are you ready to go Josie? It's getting late.\"</p><p>Stefan cleared his throat loudly, drawing Georgia's attention to him. \"If it is acceptable to Josephine, I would like to spend some time alone with her. I will make sure she gets home safely.\"</p><p>Georgia's eyes narrowed as she stared at him with irritation. His eyebrow raised in amused contempt as he held her gaze, causing Georgia to huff and look away nervously. I could count on one hand the times I'd seen someone able to ruffle Georgia and he'd managed to accomplish it with a simple, albeit powerful stare.</p><p>It didn't take long for her to recover. \"Josephine?!?\" Georgia questioned sarcastically. \"Josie, it's up to you. I can hang out...\"</p><p>\"Georgia Turner,\" Anna said, using her free hand to slap her arm in annoyance.</p><p>Waving Georgia and Anna off, I interrupted them both off before they had the chance to say anything else. \"No, it's fine. Stefan can get me home or I can call a cab.\"</p><p>\"Are you sure?\" Georgia asked leerily. I let out an unladylike snort at Georgia's hypocrisy. She'd been encouraging me to not only meet a man, but have a fling with one earlier in the evening. Had I missed something?</p><p>\"Georgia, she will be fine with me. You can come check on her tomorrow,\" Stefan said. His voice resonated with a quiet force and his lips curved into a small smile that didn't reach his eyes as he spoke to her.</p><p>Georgia appraised us both silently, her lips set in a thin line. \"Fine. I'll call you tomorrow.\" She jabbed her finger into his muscular chest, her voice threatening. \"Touch a hair on her head without her permission and you have me to deal with. Got it, pretty boy?\"</p><p>Stefan grinned, apparently amused by Georgia's grandiose threats. \"Point taken. Good evening, Anna. And to you as well, Georgia Turner.\"</p><p>I watched with relief as Georgia and Anna collected their purses and both waved a hurried goodbye to me. My relief quickly faded into anxiety as I realized I was alone with this devastatingly handsome man and I had no idea what to do.</p><p>\"Josephine, you owe me a dance, yes?\"</p><p>Without waiting for an answer, Stefan tugged me smoothly off the stool and onto the dance floor just as a slow song began to flood the room. He wrapped his long arms around me and pulled me against his chest. The top of my head barely touched the edge of his shoulder as we moved slowly together, my curves fitting perfectly against the contours of his lean body. I wrapped my arms around his broad shoulders and felt the hardness of his muscles rippling under his skin with each movement he made. This felt so familiar, like I'd been in his embrace before.</p><p>I was lulled into a dreamlike daze as we danced. One of his hands gently traced lazy patterns along my back while the other splayed around my waist. Closing my eyes against his chest, I nuzzled my nose against him and breathed in the musky smell of his skin: spicy sandalwood, the ocean and something that was just inherently masculine.</p><p>I unconsciously pressed myself closer against him and moaned when I felt the hardness of his arousal pressing against me through his jeans. Peeking at his face through my eyelashes, I was awestruck by his beauty and the emotion that had softened his face. Wrapped in his arms, I wondered if this is what if felt like to be normal. Not one emotion or premonition flooded my mind and being in his embrace made everyone else blissfully silent.</p><p>The song faded out and Stefan reluctantly pulled away, the back of his fingers caressing my cheek delicately. His voice was seductive and lilting when he spoke. \"I think it is time I took you home.\"</p><p>Nodding, I began walking towards our abandoned table and reached to pick up my purse. \"Oh, right. I'm sure you have other things to do and it's getting late. If it's too...\" My words faded out when I spun around to find myself face to face with the broad expanse of his chest. I had to fight the urge not to run my hands over the muscles visible underneath his shirt.</p><p>Chuckling softly, he leaned down slightly and his cool breath tickled my ear as he whispered to me. \"I was hoping you would invite me to your house so we could talk more.\"</p><p>The sensible voice in my head was telling me to say no. However, my impatient body and heart had a mind of their own and the words tumbled out before I could stop them. \"Come on, Romeo. Let's go to my house.\"</p><p>\"Romeo?!?\" Stefan parroted, a look of arrogance flashing across his handsome face. He ran a large hand through his hair and his free hand slipped into the front pocket of his jeans.</p><p>\"I like it, so let's just go with it,\" I retorted playfully, grabbing his hand and pulling him out of the restaurant with him following obediently behind me. I could imagine how absurd it looked to see me tugging this hulking giant of a man out behind me like a naughty child.</p><p>He gently removed his hand from mine and moved it to press against the small of my back as he led me across the parking lot to his car. It was a sleek and black with heavily tinted windows, expensive and meticulously taken care of. He opened the door gallantly for me and I lowered myself into the leather seat, feeling the heat of his eyes as they traveled the length of my legs. I cleared my throat and glanced up at him to let him know I'd caught him staring. His mouth quirked into a tiny smile as he closed the door and walked quickly around the car. He slid into the driver's seat and started the engine in one smooth motion.</p><p>\"Where are we going, Josephine?\" Stefan asked, his voice loud in the confined space of the car. I glanced at him and blinked for a moment. It hadn't hit me until now that I was inviting this man back to my home to 'talk'. I had an idea that my version of talking and his version were two different things.</p><p>\"Go right out of the parking lot, my house is about three miles down the road on the left. 28124,\" I replied quietly, watching as he made short work of backing out of the parking space and pulling quickly onto the main road.</p><p>My eyes roamed over the interior of the car. It was all leather and had every gadget available. It wasn't the typical car you'd see in Canggu. \"Your car is beautiful. It's much nicer than my jeep.\"</p><p>\"It is an Audi TT. I spare no expense when it comes to vehicles.\" Stefan shrugged offhandedly.</p><p>He hummed as he drove along and tapped his fingers against the steering wheel. I used the time to study his profile in the darkness, the lines of his face harsh in the light from the dashboard. He would occasionally glance over at me and smile tightly, almost appearing to be nervous. I felt compelled to reach for his hand across the console, lacing my fingers with his. He released a deep sigh of relief and our contact filled the car with a quiet energy. We drove along in a comfortable silence and I lost myself in the quietness of his presence.</p><p>Feeling the car slowing, I glanced out the windshield to see Stefan making the turn into my driveway. He drove slowly over the gravel and came to a stop next to my jeep. He smoothly exited the car, closing the door behind him. I was reaching for the door handle when I realized that Stefan already had the car door open with his large hand extended to me. I could only stare at him blankly for a moment, wondering how he managed to move around the car so fast.</p><p>Placing my hand in his, he gently pulled me from the car. I led him up the steps to my villa, and pulled my hand away to unlock and open the door. I walked in and turned to look at him as he stood in the open doorway. He gave me a smile that sent my pulse racing and caused a wave of desire to course through me. I motioned for him to come inside while attempting to get my raging hormones under control.</p><p>\"Come in. Can I get you something to drink. Water, tea?\" Or me, I added silently. Switching on a lamp, I watched as Stefan made himself at home on my couch and stretched his long legs out in front of him.</p><p>\"Nothing. Thank you, Josephine.\" Stefan smiled slowly and his lips parted to display his dazzling display of straight, white teeth. He stretched his long arms across the back of the couch, his blue eyes sparkling devilishly. I couldn't help but pause to admire him, thinking to myself that he looked like he belonged there.</p><p>Shaking my head, I dropped my purse on the table by the door along with my keys. I stood silently for a moment with my arms crossed under my chest. I slowly let my shields down to see if I could get any vision or emotion from him now that we were completely alone. I closed my eyes and cringed as I waited for the onslaught of both to rush into my mind. All I was greeted with was blackness, a gentle hum and the quietness of the house.</p><p>What is he?</p><p>When I opened my eyes, I noticed that Stefan was silently observing me. His handsome face darkened with intensity and I felt a gentle pressure push against my mind, as if he was trying to communicate with me. Frowning slightly, he looked at me with uncertainty and the pressure disappeared. Apparently I was as perplexing to him as he was to me. I could almost see the highly-oiled wheels of his mind calculating his next move.</p><p>He slowly rose to his feet and crossed the room to stand in front of me, his hands lightly running down the length of my arms. I shivered involuntarily from the pleasure of his touch against my skin. \"Are you okay, Josephine?\"</p><p>I was anything but 'okay'. The touch of his hands and sound of his voice was causing my senses to spin and I was frustrated that I couldn't read him. It left me feeling vulnerable, unsettled and extremely turned on.</p><p>I blinked a few times, remembering that he'd asked me a question that required an answer.</p><p>\"Yes, I'm just...\" I began hesitantly as I turned my head to look up into the blue ocean of his eyes. I was desperately searching for the right words but his piercing stare was making it impossible for me to think clearly.</p><p>\"Overwhelmed?\" Stefan answered for me, his breathing unsteady. \"I can see it in your eyes. There is no such thing as coincidence, Josephine. We were supposed to meet tonight.\"</p><p>\"We were supposed to meet?\" I asked quietly. I was frozen in place, amazed by the sincerity and emotion in his voice.</p><p>\"I suppose some would call it fate.\" Stefan ran the back of his fingers over my cheek and down the length of my neck, his eyes smoldering as they followed the path of his hand. \"You are not what I expected. You are more.\"</p><p>\"More?\" I repeated slowly. My hand moved on its own accord to trace the lines of his lips with my fingertips. I wanted, no, I needed to touch him to see if this was just another dream. I had to reassure myself that he was real. His lips were soft and I felt and watched his mouth curve into a smile under my gentle touch.</p><p>All he needed to do was kiss me and my flimsy self-control would snap in relief from the pressure.</p><p>Without another word, his head lowered and his lips collided with mine. His large hands pulled me tightly against him, molding us together. His fingers sensuously moved up my back, finally stopping to lightly fist in my hair. My body melted in his arms and my hands became busy working their way underneath the back of his shirt, relishing in the cool hardness of his body. His tongue begged for entrance into my mouth and I parted my lips to him, our tongues meeting and battling for control.</p><p>His hands drifted down to impatiently tug on the tie to my wrap dress and I moaned into his mouth as it fell open. His long fingers lingered against my skin as he pushed it over my shoulders. Stefan's lips left mine for a moment, long enough for his hooded eyes to wander slowly and deliberately over my nearly naked body.</p><p>\"Beautiful,\" he murmured thickly, reclaiming my lips in a brief kiss. \"Where is your bedroom?\"</p><p>\"Down the hallway, Stefan,\" I breathed in response.</p><p>He swept me up into his arms and my legs instinctively wrapped around his narrow waist. His hands cupped my ass as he quickly carried me into my bedroom, softly placing me in the middle of the bed. Stefan stood motionless above me as his eyes possessively raked over my body. He was almost feline in nature, his posture predatory.</p><p>\"Stefan, take off your clothes. Please,\" I whispered impatiently. I couldn't wait to see him naked since he was close to perfection fully clothed.</p><p>He leered at me for a moment and raised an eyebrow in response to my request. He knew he had me exactly where he wanted me: nearly naked on my bed and writhing in need for him.</p><p>And he was totally in control.</p><p>\"As you wish.\" His voice was deep as he pulled his shirt over his head swiftly and let it drop carelessly on the floor. His large hands unbuttoned his jeans and his fingers moved slowly as they lowered the zipper. He pushed them over his hips and let the denim fall around his feet. He stood gloriously naked in front of me and my eyes shamelessly moved over his broad chest, down the planes of his finely muscled stomach to finally linger on the impressive length of his long cock. If I had any doubt of his arousal before, I certainly didn't now. He was hard and his cock was almost begging for me to touch him.</p><p>\"Do you like what you see, Josephine?\"</p><p>I didn't answer him. Instead, I crawled across the bed and raised up on my knees to rest my trembling hands against his chest. My palms were flat as they slid down his lean torso and wrapped around his hardened shaft. Leaning down to kiss his chest, I laved my tongue from his nipple to his collarbone and savored the spicy taste of his skin. I slowly ran my nose against his neck and stopped to run my tongue over the shell of his ear. His hands grasped my face and dragged my lips back to his, capturing my mouth in a kiss that was all-consuming. My hands increased their speed in response to him, gently stroking the entire length of his cock from base to tip.</p><p>When he wrenched his mouth away, I didn't resist as his hands roughly pushed me to my back again. He slowly inched his way onto the bed, his mouth and hands trailing up my stomach to caress the curve of my breast. He pressed against me at the same time his wet mouth circled one of my nipples. He sucked hard and lifted his hips away when I tried to grind against him. His teeth nibbled across my shoulder and against my throat until his lips met mine, his mouth demanding and greedy.</p><p>Stefan's fingers drifted over the front of my panties, my hips bucking against his hand as they moved across the hot wetness that had soaked through the fabric. My head arched back against the bed as his mouth lowered to nip at my exposed neck.</p><p>\"So impatient. \" He continued to brush his mouth over my throat and neck, alternating between kissing and licking my skin. One of my hands moved between us to stroke the length of his cock again. I moaned loudly when I felt the satiny hardness jerk in response to my touch.</p><p>A low growl escaped his chest as his large hand grasped my face. His thumb gently stroked across my cheekbone before he kissed me with more force than he had before. He pulled my tongue deeper into his mouth as his other hand inched down my stomach to roughly grip my hip. His fingers wrapped around the side of my panties and he impatiently ripped the fabric away with a quick snap of his wrist, his hands stroking the outside of my wet pussy. My breathing was coming in ragged pants, growing louder each time his fingers grazed against my swollen clit.</p><p>He lifted his lips from mine to kiss his way back down to my sensitive breasts, rolling his tongue around each nipple until they hardened into tight peaks.</p><p>\"You have no idea how desirable you are. Or how long I have waited to see you like this,\" Stefan whispered. His mouth resumed its path down my body at a remarkably slow pace. His lips drifted down my stomach and continued their descent until he made his way down to my hips. His large hands grasped the inside of my thighs, pressing them open as wide as possible. His tongue darted out to lick across his lower lip when he saw my wet sex completely open and ready for him. He expertly maneuvered his broad shoulders between my legs.</p><p>\"Fucking beautiful,\" Stefan whispered, placing an open mouthed kiss against my clit. His lips moved to kiss the inside of each thigh all the way to the crease on the side of my folds, tracing his tongue along the same path. He took one long lick from my entrance to return to my clit, swirling his tongue hungrily around it.</p><p>\"Josephine,\" he murmured against me softly. My eyes flickered to focus on him and his blue eyes were watching me, hooded and dark. I arched against him, moaning from the combination of his eyes watching me and the feeling of his talented mouth against me. My hands frantically grasped at the covers and my head thrashed against the pillow.</p><p>He had unlocked a part inside of me that was ravenous and starving to simply feel.</p><p>I don't think a coherent word escaped my lips as his mouth ravaged me. He let me writhe under his ministrations. My hips bucked against his face, pulling him in closer as his tongue dove into me without any mercy. He used both of his thumbs to hold me open and to press against my clit. He replaced his tongue with two of his long fingers, slowly sliding them inside of me.</p><p>\"I do not know if I can stop,\" Stefan moaned against me, his fingers rhythmically curling up against my slick walls. I instinctively clenched around them, encouraging him to continue.</p><p>\"Don't stop,\" I replied brokenly. \"Ever. Please.\"</p><p>He hesitated for a moment and I couldn't help but notice a brief glimmer of emotion flicker across his face. His movements were sensual as he pressed his body against mine, slipping one of his hands between us to guide his hard cock into me at an almost agonizingly slow pace, giving me time to adjust to his size.</p><p>When he was fully sheathed inside of me, he stopped for a moment. He pulled back and plunged back in, his thrusts shallow.</p><p>\"Stefan, I need you to fuck me.. I can't..I need you,\" I begged hoarsely and clutched desperately at his arms. I felt desire clawing at me, hot and sharp. My hips bucked uncontrollably against him, willing him to move faster and deeper.</p><p>I watched in amazement as he slowly lost control before my eyes. His darkened blue eyes dilated until they were almost black and he moved at almost inhuman speed to shackle my wrists in his hands. He withdrew his cock completely, only to slam back inside of me as he growled with desperation. He repeated the motion until I unashamedly begged him for more. I dragged my legs back and slightly tilted my hips, pulling him in deeper to meet each of his hard thrusts. I groaned as he slowed his pace down, fully burying himself completely inside of my wet sex.</p><p>\"Du kommer att vara d?d f?r mig,\" he mumbled against my neck as he maintained his slow, powerful strokes inside of me. I could feel myself slowly coming apart at the seams, one thread at a time.</p><p>\"Stefan...I need to come,\" I begged. The voice coming out of my mouth didn't sound like my own. It sounded raw, brazen and demanding.</p><p>He released my wrists and my hands instinctively reached up to grab his hair, dragging his face down to reclaim his lips with my own, my tongue pushing forcefully inside of his mouth. The speed and intensity of his thrusts increased, his cool skin sliding against the slickness of my flushed body. I cried out against his mouth and begged for release. My back rose off the bed as I began to slowly clench around his cock, waves of ecstasy flowing through me.</p><p>\"Come for me, Josephine,\" Stefan murmured against my lips. His hand moved between us to circle my clit as I tumbled over the edge, my inner walls contracting around him as I shuddered underneath him.</p><p>His cock twitched and he released deep inside of me, a guttural cry escaping his lips. \"Knulla det. Jag kommer!\" His head fell back against his shoulders as his orgasm overtook him.</p><p>He raised his head slowly and lowered his trembling mouth to mine, his lips gentle. \"Det var otroligt. Du ?r en gudinna.\"</p><p>He rolled to my side and rested his head lightly against my shoulder. His body curved around mine, our breathing ragged. I was slowly starting to regain my senses and I turned my head slightly to stare into his eyes, my fingers absently stroking his silky hair. He smiled at me lazily, his face relaxed and euphoric.</p><p>\"You need to tell me what you said. My brain doesn't have Google Translate,\" I managed to murmur weakly, my spent body was filled with an amazing sense of completeness I'd never felt before. I shifted to my side to place my head on his chest, curling up against him. I expected to hear his heart hammering in his chest like my own, but his chest was silent against my face.</p><p>Flooded with panic, I struggled to sit up. How could he have no heart beat? It wasn't possible. My mind was filled with anxiety and confusion as I desperately tried to come up with an explanation that made sense.</p><p>\"Josephine,\" Stefan said. His hand wrapped gently around my arm, keeping me in place.</p><p>\"What are you?\" I sputtered, my own heart racing even faster. I placed a tentative, shaking hand over his chest, hoping that I'd been mistaken and I'd feel the steady strum of his heart underneath my hand.</p><p>I felt nothing except his cool, velvety skin against my fingers. My eyes searched his and I could tell by the expression on his face that I wasn't going to like his answer.</p><p>\"Josephine, I did not want you to find out this way.\" He looked away for a moment, focusing on the wall. His blue eyes were somber and his shoulders were tense when he finally looked back to me. \"I am a vampire.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He's a vampire? Everyone knows vampires don't exist. They're mythical creatures, like unicorns and werewolves. I glanced at Stefan's face skeptically and waited for the punch line. After studying his solemn face for a moment, it started to sink in that he was serious. He was a vampire, the stuff of legends.</p><p>A nervous laugh escaped as I considered his words. A vampire?!? I yanked my arm away from him and jumped up from the bed to frantically pace the room in search of my robe. I couldn't help but wonder why I was worrying about a robe since he'd seen every part (and I mean every part) of me intimately. If nothing else, it gave me something else to do besides think about the supposed nonexistent creature sitting on my bed. Nervously chewing my bottom lip, I continued to pace, spotting my robe on the chaise lounge chair. I pulled it on and tied the belt tightly around my waist. Now that I was dressed, I had a million questions to ask him but no idea where to begin.</p><p>\"Josephine, please let me explain,\" Stefan begged, pulling his large frame up to a sitting position, his blue gaze intense as he watched me continue to pace the room.</p><p>\"You're a vampire. And you chose me for dinner? Is this what you do, Stefan? Pick up unsuspecting women, seduce them and then...bite them? Or kill them?\" I asked, feeling traitorous tears burn my eyes. A tumble of confused thoughts and feelings assaulted me. Was I just another woman he'd seduced, used for sex and was going to throw away? The urge for me to emotionally shut down was tempting.</p> <p>\"Is that what you think? That I chose you for dinner? Josephine, I have been waiting for you for many years. And here you are,\" Stefan murmured, reaching for my arm, the weight of his hand stopping my rapid pacing. \"Please. All I ask is that you listen to me for a moment. I beg you.\"</p><p>Sighing heavily, I let my eyes close as I considered his pleas for me to listen and my situation. I'd found a vampire that claims he's been waiting for me for years. I'd willingly brought him home with me and had sex with him. And not just sex, but 'mind-blowing sex that made me want to lose my mind' kind of sex. I took a shaky, deep breath in and exhaled slowly. When I opened my eyes, I felt slightly calmer. I noticed that he was still sitting motionless with his hand on my arm, like a beautifully carved statue. My earlier resolve to shut down was crumbling.</p><p>\"You can explain in a minute but I have questions. How old are you?\" I asked uneasily. His eyes met mine for a moment, his expression dark and his mouth was set in a narrow line. The silence between us grew tight with tension and a cold knot gripped my stomach as I waited for him to answer.</p><p>\"How old am I now or how old was I when I became a vampire?\" Stefan questioned softly, the accent in his voice heavier than before. The self-assured, swaggering man I'd met on the beach was gone, replaced with this subdued and hesitant version of himself.</p><p>I promptly decided I preferred the confident, cocky version to one sitting before me now.</p> <p>\"Humor me. Both,\" I blurted out, sitting down nervously on the edge of the bed and tucking my legs underneath me.</p><p>Stefan stood and his naked form was impressive even in the shadows of my bedroom. I watched his back muscles tense as he walked to the opposite side of the room and braced his arms against the window frame, his blond head falling forward. My eyes unintentionally started tracing down the toned expanse of his back and lingered over his taut ass.</p><p>In spite of the situation I'd gotten myself into, my desire for him coiled in the pit of my stomach. I already had feelings for him that had nothing to do with rational thought or reason.</p><p>\"My human life ended in 1070. I was 33 years old when I became a vampire,\" Stefan glanced at me over his shoulder, pushing off of the window frame. He averted his eyes and focused on the floor as if deciding what to say next.</p><p>I sat in a stupor as I mentally worked the math out in my head. He was 975 years old?! My poor mind had gone into a state of overload. To give myself a chance to recover, I started firing off questions about vampire legends.</p><p>\"Mirrors?\"</p> <p>\"Myth.\"</p><p>\"Sunlight?\"</p><p>He sighed irritably. \"Another myth. It is bothersome to our eyes more than anything. Sunglasses help.\"</p><p>\"Garlic?\"</p><p>\"Unpleasant to smell. No worse than any other human food. Do you have more vampire legends for me to dispel?\"</p><p>\"One more. Do you sleep in a...\" I hesitated, rolling my eyes at my own absurdity. I'd just had sex with this gorgeous creature in front of me and now I was going to be shy about asking him questions? I really did need to look into mental help.</p><p>\"A coffin? No. I sleep when I want to sleep. Day time. Night time.\" Stefan finished my sentence and dropped beside of me, his hand rubbing up and down my arm. I settled against his shoulder, both physically and mentally drained. After a moment I felt the weight of his head rest lightly on top of mine. \"I truly did not want you to find out this way. There really is not an easy way to break this to someone, Josephine.\"</p><p>\"If you're a vampire, why didn't you bite me? And why tell me anything?\" I cringed after I asked that question. I was glad to see my lack of internal filter and verbal diarrhea was still working properly.</p> <p>Stefan laughed softly, his chest moving against me. I heard a soft click. \"Josephine, look at me.\"</p><p>Raising my head to look at him, I gasped when I saw the proof I couldn't deny. Fangs. My dream man had blond hair, blue eyes, a face like an angel, a body like Adonis and fangs. Sexy fangs. My fingers unconsciously lifted and started to reach out to touch them. I realized what I was doing and nervously dropped my hand into my lap, clasping my hands together. Stefan smiled, his fangs retracting and disappearing before my eyes.</p><p>\"As strong as my urge is to bite, making love to you was more important. The way I tasted you earlier was better than simply biting you.\" Stefan waggled his eyebrows, causing a blush to spread across my face.</p><p>\"Is biting me something you want to do?\" I asked curiously, feeling moisture pool between my legs as I thought of his fangs slipping into my skin. Stefan immediately noticed my arousal, his nostrils flaring and his eyes darkening in response.</p><p>\"Ah, Josephine. Biting you is something I would enjoy. You would enjoy it as well. But I will only do it with your consent,\" Stefan paused and his hand smoothed my hair behind my ear. \"To answer your other question, I told you because I have been looking and waiting for you for over 200 years. You are more perceptive than I had assumed you would be.\"</p><p>I was torn between wanting to run for Georgia's villa and having my way with him. Or both.</p><p>\"I need a minute. Maybe ten,\" I stuttered, walking from the bedroom into the bathroom and closing the door with shaky hands. I sank down on the cold tile of the bathroom, my head in my hands. I alternated between hyperventilating and dry sobbing.</p><p>Minutes passed. I lost track of time as I sat huddled on my bathroom floor until I felt ready to face him again. My legs were still shaking when I finally stood up and turned on the tap, splashing my face with cold water. I patted my face dry and took a moment to look at myself in the mirror, wondering what I'd gotten myself into. With no real answer coming to mind, I let out a tired sigh and walked back into the bedroom. Stefan had put his jeans back on and was standing at the window again, his hands shoved into the front pockets.</p><p>\"You and I have much to discuss. It is late and you are tired. Can we resume this tomorrow?\" Stefan asked, his face heavy. His eyes never left the window, refusing to look at me. He'd heard my meltdown and he was still here waiting for me. That had to mean something.</p><p>\"I want you, Stefan. I don't care what you are. I just want you,\" I said aloud before I could stop the words from falling from my mouth. \"You, Stefan. Only you.\"</p><p>His eyes quickly darted to mine in surprise. Wanting to prove my point, I boldly untied my robe and let it pool around my feet. I took small, tentative steps towards him, my gaze never faltering. I stood inches from him, moving my hands over his long arms and across his chest. He closed his eyes, dropping his head against his back and he groaned loudly in approval.</p><p>Grasping his biceps, I pushed him backwards until his legs touched the bed. I gave him a gentle shove and he fell back against the mattress, his broad torso spread across the middle of the bed. Before I lost my nerve, I straddled his hips and my hands traced down the muscles of his chest, brushing through the fine blond hair around his nipples. I leaned down to let my lips lightly caress the curve of his jar and let my breasts press against him.</p><p>\"I desire you more than anything, Josephine. You must believe me,\" Stefan murmured, his voice melodic. His hands drifted across my lower back to encircle me in his arms, pulling me tightly against him until our faces were so close that I could feel his cool breath wash across my face.</p><p>\"Stefan, I want to believe you. I want to believe you've spent 200 years looking for me. Anyone that I've let get close to me has left me or lied to me. And all of this is almost too much to believe. \"</p><p>\"Then I will have to prove otherwise. I will make it my mission to explain everything to you,\" Stefan assured me, gently stroking my back. I relaxed against him, giving myself over to the delicious feeling of his smooth skin against mine.</p><p>He pulled away from me and placed me gently on the bed with my head on the pillow. He stood to unzip his jeans, quickly removing them to rejoin me in bed. He gently rubbed his fingers over my cheek, kissing me chastely. My lips eagerly attempted to deepen the kiss as I pressed closer to him, my leg hooking over his thigh. His large hand gripped my leg and he lifted his mouth from mine, shaking his head regretfully.</p><p>\"As much as I want you Josephine, we will not make love again until we talk.\" Stefan leaned to kiss my forehead. \"Tomorrow.\"</p><p>\"Tomorrow,\" I agreed and let out a sigh of disappointment. He wrapped me in his arms and before I drifted off to sleep, I could swear I heard him purr.</p><p>Watching him sleep, I lightly traced his face with my fingers. I was expecting to wake up this morning and find last night to be a figment of my imagination. Not only was he real, he was still here this morning.</p><p>I struggled to remove myself from the giant that had wrapped himself around me. Finally freeing myself, I grabbed a tank top and shorts and headed down the hall to the bathroom. I slid the door closed slowly and stood with my back against it, my breath coming in excited gasps when I my earlier thoughts came rushing back. Last night was not only real, he was still here this morning! I sighed at my giddiness and tried to fight the smile that threatened to break over my face, taking a few moments to go through my morning routine. I quickly got dressed and headed down the hallway to the living room. I pulled back the curtains to my patio and opened the door to head outside on my back deck.</p><p>It was a beautiful morning, the sun was warm and I couldn't resist tilting my head back to enjoy the heat as it spread across my face and shoulders. I closed my eyes and drew in a deep breath of warm air. I made short work of spreading out my mat, hoping that when all else failed, yoga and meditation would help make me feel more centered. Right now, I'd try anything to make my brain stop over-thinking the events of the last 24 hours.</p><p>I couldn't have been more wrong. It was a struggle to clear my thoughts during meditation and I grew angry when my mind kept wandering back to the sleeping vampire in my bedroom. Finally giving up on meditating, I began my yoga routine. I was half way through when I could feel eyes watching my every move. I was in the plow pose when he finally cleared his throat to get my attention. Slowly lowering my legs, I fixed my gaze on him.</p><p>\"Yoga?\" Stefan questioned curiously, leaning against the frame of the open door. He was shirtless and his eyes were covered with sunglasses. His body was pale in the sunlight and the fine blond hair on his chest and arms shined beautifully. I shook my head to try to clear the thoughts about his arm and chest hair before I spent an hour waxing poetic about it.</p><p>\"I've been practicing yoga for three years.\" I shrugged and rolled my yoga mat up. I suddenly felt shy and self-conscious in his presence, my earlier excitement waning as my insecurities reared their ugly head.</p><p>\"It looks...interesting. You are very flexible,\" Stefan smirked, crossing his muscular arms under his chest.</p><p>Ah, the confident Stefan was back this morning. I could see his eyes through his sunglasses, raking down the length of my body and obviously enjoying my skimpy shorts and tank top. I brushed past him to go back into the house and grabbed a bottle of water from the small refrigerator in the kitchen with Stefan following silently behind me.</p><p>Sinking down onto the couch, I rested my head on the cushion behind me and closed my eyes. I felt the couch move under his weight as he sat beside of me and I listened as his fingers drummed against his muscular thighs.</p><p>Opening my eyes, I focused on his long fingers as they impatiently tapped away. It was clear that Stefan was edgy and ready to talk. I wasn't ready to discuss anything, despite my promise that we would. His fingers stilled and he suddenly tensed beside of me, his head slightly turning to the side as if listening to something or someone.</p><p>\"Your friend is here to check on you,\" Stefan whispered in a grudging voice. How had he heard her? I had to strain to make out the sounds of the key in the lock and the door opening quietly.</p><p>\"Knock, knock!\" Georgia shouted, closing the door behind her. She bounced into the living room with her hands on her hips, quickly evaluating the situation in front of her. It didn't take a psychic to know that Georgia was curious, relieved and wanted details in no particular order.</p><p>\"Georgia, you're as fucking subtle as a groin kick,\" I grumbled and rolled my eyes in aggravation. This day was getting better and better by the moment and it was still only morning.</p><p>\"Georgia Turner. You came to check on Josephine. As promised, she is in perfect condition,\" Stefan said as he stood up, leaning in to kiss my forehead before heading down the hallway to the bedroom. I watched as Georgia's eyes took in his retreating form and felt a small jolt of jealousy course through me as I could sense the lust radiating from her. He returned to the living room with his shirt and flip flops in his hands, a grin tugging at the right side of his mouth.</p><p>\"Yes, I can see,\" Georgia pursed her lips, trying to be discreet as her eyes traced over the muscles in his chest. \"Your ass is safe for now, big blond and sexy.\"</p><p>Stefan pulled the t-shirt over his head and slid his feet into his shoes. He glanced at Georgia with a mixture of amusement and annoyance in his sparkling blue eyes. \"Georgia, I sense either you and I will either be great friends or we will constantly be at each others' throats. For Josephine's sake, we should attempt to be friends.\"</p><p>The double meaning of his words was unmistakable to me. I instantly had a mental picture of what Stefan meant about being at her throat and felt a cold shiver run down my spine. She had no idea she was testing the patience of a vampire that could literally and figuratively rip her throat out.</p><p>Georgia tapped her finger on her chin, her eyes twinkling. \"I suppose we could be friends. You're much too pretty to maim permanently.\"</p><p>Stefan crouched his six-foot-four frame down in front of me. He put his finger under my chin to raise my eyes to look into his. A beautiful smile broke over his lips, making his face almost glow.</p><p>\"You need to talk to your friend. I have issues that require my attention,\" Stefan murmured quietly. \"I will be back in a few hours. Will you be safe?\"</p><p>\"Stefan, I managed to stay safe for 28 years. I think I can manage for a few hours,\" I retorted indignantly as he rose to his full height.</p><p>When had my life turned into concerns about my safety and having cryptic conversations with secret vampires? Oh, that would be last night when I brought one home and had mind-numbing sex with one. That's when it happened.</p><p>\"I will see you soon, Josephine. Until we meet again, Georgia Turner.\"</p><p>\"You need to stop calling me by my full name, smart ass. It's just Georgia.\"</p><p>He gave her a dry smile, slightly inclining his head. Stefan winked at me, quietly leaving the villa. I heard his car start, the purr of the motor disappearing as it got farther away from the house.</p><p>Georgia settled into the chair across from me and scrutinized me. I mentally prepared herself for the laundry list of questions she had ready for me.</p><p>\"Well honey, I have to give you credit. You know how to pick 'em. Tall, blond and delicious.\" Georgia was just getting warmed up, rubbing her hands together as her eyes gleamed. \"So, how was it?\"</p><p>Crossing my legs, I looked at the ceiling in exasperation while making a calculated decision to play stupid. I knew it would do two things simultaneously: stall her questions and piss her off. \"How was what?\"</p><p>Georgia let out a loud sigh, taking the time to adjust the ponytail that was perched high on the top of her head. \"Darlin', let's not play stupid. You're much smarter than that and we both know this. So make it easy on momma and tell me the details.\"</p><p>I pursed my lips. \"It was wonderful. End of story.\"</p><p>Georgia stood up, padding around the living room and glanced out the window. \"He said he's coming back here in a few hours. Care to share why that is?\"</p><p>I could feel the muscles in my shoulders tensing. I wasn't ready to have a conversation with her about Stefan, what his coming back meant or what potential we had as a couple. Did we have potential? I never thought I'd be worried about having a relationship, but here I was thinking about having one with an almost millennia old vampire.</p><p>What a difference a day makes.</p><p>Now it was Georgia that crouched down in front of me, her dark blue eyes concerned. \"Honey, we talked about this last night and you insisted you didn't date or mix with men. Mr. Hunky McHunkerson sweeps in last night, brings your home for some wonderful 'whatever', and he's telling you he'll be back in a few hours. You have to see why I'm confused, sweetie,\" Georgia paused, patting my leg. \"This isn't like you and I just want to know that you're okay with all of this. You are okay with all of this, right?\"</p><p>I couldn't help but smile at Georgia. She was one of the few friends I'd managed to keep over my years of travel. She could drive you to the edge of drinking heavily, but she was fiercely protective of her friends. She reminded me of a momma bear with her cubs.</p><p>\"To be honest, I don't know what the hell is going on, Georgia,\" I whispered, averting my eyes from her perceptive gaze. I swallowed hard and licked my lips nervously. \"I like him and he likes me. Not to mention he's different from other men.\"</p><p>\"He's not from around here and I'd keep that one on a short leash, girlfriend.\" Georgia grinned, standing up and heading for the front door. \"I'm heading into town. Call me later?\"</p><p>\"Absolutely,\" I agreed, watching the door close behind her and releasing the breath I didn't realize I'd been holding. I was exhausted from my conversations with Stefan and Georgia. I was going to take a shower, eat lunch and take a nap and not feel the least bit guilty about it.</p><p>The feel of fingers trailing up my legs, soft and cool stirred me out of my sleep. Stretching, I opened my eyes to see a very naked Stefan stretched out beside me on the bed like a giant lion, his eyes and hands focused on my exposed legs.</p><p>I couldn't resist just staring at him for a moment, noticing all the little things I'd missed last night. His flawless skin was stretched taut across his cheekbones and his nose was slightly crooked. His lower lip was slightly fuller than the top and currently his teeth were biting into it, as if the task at hand required all of his concentration. His golden blond hair had fallen over his forehead, shielding his eyes. My attention focused on the dip between his collarbones and I suddenly had the urge to put my mouth there. Or possibly my tongue.</p><p>\"Someone is awake.\" Stefan's voice jerked me from my thoughts. He lifted his head and smiled slyly at me. I sleepily smiled back, stretching like a cat.</p><p>\"Hey. You're back already,\" I murmured, my head still thick with sleep. Running my fingers over the skin on his arm, I lightly scratched him with my fingernails and watched as his eyes flickered from the sensation.</p><p>\"I could not stay away for long. You have made me an addict and I can only think of you,\" he replied, lowering his head to brush his lips against the skin on my legs. \"You have on too many clothes.\"</p><p>My body jolted, going from groggy to wide awake in the matter of seconds. Desire slowly spread over my body and wetness began to flood between my legs. He noticed my arousal and he blurred into action.</p><p>He yanked the sheet away from the rest of my body, eying my tank top and boy cut shorts with displeasure. He pulled the shorts off of me with one swift tug and his hands moved up my body to slowly roll the tank top over my breasts and head, tossing it across the room. He reclined on his side next to me, his muscles flexing as his fingers drifted around the circle of my breast, sliding down my stomach to the swell of my hips. His head leaned down to pull my nipple into his mouth, rolling his tongue around it until it pebbled tautly. A delightful shiver of wanting ran through me as his mouth moved to the other, repeating the sensual dance.</p><p>\"What should I do with you? There are so many choices.\" Stefan looked me over seductively and a tiny moan escaped from my lips. He spread my legs open wide, his fingers rubbing against my clit and spreading the wetness over my folds.</p><p>\"I could do this.\" Two long fingers disappeared inside of my wet pussy, slowly slipping in and out, his darkened eyes fixed on my face as he watched me writhe from his touch. I let out a sharp gasp as he slowly continued his ministrations, his movements deliberate and determined.</p><p>\"Oh god. Don't stop,\" I whimpered, clutching his muscular arms with my hands. I heard his ragged sigh of satisfaction from my response. He lowered his mouth to my neck and his lips moved down my throat, his tongue cool and wet against my heated skin.</p><p>\"Never,\" Stefan whispered. My hips frantically rocked against his hand, his fingers stroking and curling inside of me while his thumb rubbed tight circles around my clit. My inner walls clenched around them and I boldly cried out in pleasure, begging for his cock.</p><p>Even though he was the one that had mentioned addiction, my need for him was like a drug running through my veins. I didn't care about anything right now except wanting more of him.</p><p>\"You never have to beg,\" Stefan murmured, his voice deep and raspy. He moved between my thighs and my leg wrapped around him, guiding him to me. With one quick thrust he buried himself inside of me, his hips thrusting slowly as he lowered his body against mine, my aching nipples pressing against the hardness of his chest.</p><p>He sucked my lower lip into his mouth, nipped it with his teeth, then closed his mouth hard over mine. My other leg moved to wrap around his hips and a growl rumbled in his chest, hissing as his cock slipped deeper inside of me, our bodies moving together in a frantic rhythm.</p><p>He raised his mouth from mine and gazed into my eyes. \"Josephine.\" His soft lips descended down my neck, his tongue swirling over the pulsing hollow at the base of my throat.</p><p>A broken sob escaped my lips as he continued to plunge into me, filling me with full, heavy strokes. He lowered his mouth to my breast, his tongue circling my nipple and his sharp fangs scraping lightly against my skin.</p><p>\"Fuck, Stefan...bite,\" I wailed hoarsely. The speed of his thrusts slowed for a moment as he raised his hooded eyes search mine. \"Do it!\"</p><p>Stefan eyes locked with mine as his lips closed over my right nipple. I cried out when his fangs sank into my breast, the sting painfully exquisite. I exploded into a million pieces around him as he drank from me, my climax triggering his own. He shuddered as he emptied inside of me, his hips thrusting erratically as he rode out his orgasm. I clung to him desperately until he stilled against me and retracted his fangs from my breast.</p><p>He fell to my side and pulled me with him so we were facing each other. His lips hovered over mine, his breath cool against my face. I kissed his lips, his chin and down his neck lazily. He hugged me tightly, nudging his head against mine like a cuddly, dangerous cat.</p><p>We were lying in a tangled heap of arms and legs on the bed. My hands were absently stroking patterns on his muscular back, smiling as I felt the muscles ripple underneath the movement of my fingers. Closing my eyes, I snuggled against him and marveled at how he felt against my skin, cool and like velvet-covered steel.</p><p>His voice was quiet and distant when he finally spoke. \"I broke my promise. I said we would not do this again until we talked.\"</p><p>\"Yeah, it was horrible how you took advantage of me like that,\" I said sarcastically. \"It's not like I put up any kind of fight,\" I murmured, running my nose against the soft skin of his neck.</p><p>Stefan smiled against my temple, then placed a light kiss in its place. I closed my eyes and tightened my arms around him, mentally willing him to stay. I didn't want whatever we had to end.</p><p>\"Josephine, I do not want this to end,\" Stefan whispered against my face. He pressed light kisses along my cheekbone and sighed with contentment.</p><p>Shocked at his similar words, I turned my head to look at him and felt my face soften into a smile when I saw the honesty shining in his eyes. I moved a shaky hand up to stroke his face, the slight stubble scratching the tips of my fingers.</p><p>\"I don't either, Stefan. So it's time for you to tell me everything. Even the things I don't want to know.\" I leaned in to place a kiss on his lips. He closed his eyes and brought his hands behind my head to bury them in my hair. I hadn't meant for the kiss to deepen, but I was powerless against him as he hungrily explored my mouth with his tongue. He slowly broke away from me, a satisfied smile on his lips. He knew the power he had over me already.</p><p>Sneaky bastard.</p><p>\"I will tell you everything I know and answer any question you have, Josephine. But first you need to tell me why you are here in Bali. And then, you need to tell me what you are,\" Stefan murmured, tightening his grip against my arms. He already knew me well enough to know that my first instinct would be to run.</p><p>My eyes widened, my panicked mind a jumble of questions and emotions. How much did he know? And more importantly, how had he figured it out? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Why do you need to know why I'm in Bali? Why are you in Bali?\"</p><p>I asked nervously, hoping that diversion would work with Stefan. His eyes narrowed and he raised a single eyebrow in amused disapproval at my attempt to deflect his questions. I should have known I'd be wasting my time. Obviously he had planned on how this conversation was going to work and I just needed to get with the program.</p><p>\"That is an easy question for me to answer. To get away from vampire bullshit. Along with other reasons,\" Stefan answered, his jaw tensing with annoyance. \"I find it unfair that I am answering your questions, yet I asked you first. Let me ask you again, Josephine. Why are you here?\"</p><p>Shifting anxiously, I tried for nonchalance as I blurted out my standard bullshit line. \"I'm a writer and I needed to get away. Why does it matter to you why I'm here?\"</p> <p>Stefan released his grip on my arms and moved his large frame to sit against the headboard of my bed, crossing his arms and silently appraising me. I shifted under the weight of his stare and hoped that if I didn't answer, his questions would stop. I wasn't accustomed to answering to anyone, let alone a 975 year old vampire.</p><p>I had a sinking feeling those days were over.</p><p>\"That sounds like the rehearsed version of why you're here. Let us try another avenue. Tell me what you are and I will tell you why it is important that I know,\" Stefan paused, his face unreadable. \"I had no problem telling you what I am and answering your questions. Can you not do the same for me?\"</p><p>Pulling my legs up on the bed so my chin was resting on my knees, I let my hair fall around my face, shielding me from the scrutiny of his eyes. Logically, I knew he was right but fear gripped my chest like a vice. A tear escaped from my eye and ran down my cheek.</p><p>Stefan leaned forward, gently wiping the tear away with the pad of his thumb. \"Tell me, Josephine. You can trust me.\"</p> <p>I pulled in a shaky breath. He'd answered every question I'd thrown at him without any hesitation. My closely guarded secret about my abilities paled in comparison to his own confession about being a mythical creature.</p><p>I could already tell I was going to hate it when he was right.</p><p>\"I am a writer. And I did need to get away. From people,\" I said quietly. My eyes drifted to the bamboo floor before looking at him again. \"I'm a psychic empath, Stefan. Being around a lot of people drain me. You're the only other person that knows about this in Bali besides Anna and I'd like to keep it that way.\"</p><p>\"Can you read me?\" He asked, motioning with his hand for me to continue. His face was still a stony mask.</p><p>\"No, you're a blank,\" I replied, pulling my legs closer to my body. \"Georgia doesn't even know. Usually when people find out, I'm either treated like a Magic 8-Ball or looked at like a freak. I know how someone feels and I know things about people I don't want to know. I have visions that play out in my mind like a movie. You were different though. You came to me in my dreams.\"</p><p>Stefan's eyebrow raised again and he leaned forward in interest. \"You had dreams about me? Explain.\"</p> <p>Sighing heavily, I lifted my head up from my knees to meet his curious stare. I could thank my verbal diarrhea for this slip since I hadn't wanted to mention my dreams to him. \"I had a few dreams about a man that looked like you. They seemed real and in them you spoke to me. Don't be mad...I can't help what pops into my head.\"</p><p>His face relaxed into a dazzling smile. \"Josephine, I am anything but angry. Let me tell you my story, the best I can remember it,\" Stefan paused, running his tongue over his bottom lip and patting the bed beside of him with his large hand. I scooted to sit next to him, putting my head on his shoulder and laying my legs across his lap so I could look at him while he spoke.</p><p>He wrapped his arm around me and his eyes took on a far away quality as he searched through his memories, his fingers absently trailing over my tops of my thighs. \"I was much like you during my human life. I had visions of events that had not yet happened and like you, I told few of my ability. After my human death my gift remained intact. Instead of seeing the futures of humans I can see the futures of other vampires. The ability has gotten stronger as I age. I have also gained the ability to control my gift and can turn it off when needed. At times a vision will leak through. It is not an exact science.\"</p><p>I snorted sarcastically at his last statement and Stefan laughed dryly in response. The corners of his mouth lifted in a slight smile as he continued with his story.</p><p>\"It was approximately 200 years ago that I had a vision of a beautiful human woman on a beach. She would be a kindred spirit and her voice would call to me. I did not understand what that meant at the time, nor had I ever had a vision of a human after becoming a vampire. You can probably imagine the confusion I felt, knowing my destiny was to find her but having no idea where to begin looking for her or how to do it. After two centuries of searching, I found her. You,\" Stefan paused and his face broke into a glorious smile. \"I had to wait over 200 years to find you, Josephine. Now I have to convince you to remain by my side.\"</p><p>He was worried about convincing me to stay? As scared as I was of having any kind of romantic relationship, there was something about him that drew me to him. The attraction between us was so profound it was almost magnetic. My mind drifted over our conversation and I had more questions for him.</p><p>\"You mentioned 'vampire bullshit.' What exactly does that mean?\" I questioned. Was there a network of vampires? And if so, I wondered if they were as annoying as humans that networked? I tried to envision vampires logging on to 'VampBook,' posting status updates and sending out friend requests. I inwardly laughed at the thought of vampires starting groups and 'liking' pages.</p><p>\"Yes to both. They are as annoying as humans that network and we do network. There is no 'VampBook,' yet I am sure the board would find the idea interesting.\" Stefan hesitated, taking an unnecessary breath. \"There are five members that sit on a Council. The Council answers to an Administrative Board of three. I assure you, it is boring and tedious.\" Stefan rolled his eyes, his lips frowning slightly. \"I work mainly with the Board, because of both my age and ability. The Board sends their requests for me through the Council. Their requests are non-negotiable.\"</p> <p>My eyes widened in alarm as he talked. I hadn't asked him about networking vampires out loud, I'd thought about it! He's also a mind-reader?! I buried my head in my hands for a moment, trying to hide the blush that was quickly spreading. He'd been reading every thought that had I'd had about him and he hadn't bothered to share that information with me? I was so furious I could hardly put a coherent thought together.</p><p>\"Back up the train, Romeo. You can read minds?\" I screeched loudly, feeling the burn of anger flush across my face.</p><p>Stefan cringed and placed his long index finger over my lips. \"We are in the same room, there is no reason to scream like a banshee. I can assure you my hearing is perfect. In fact, I can hear Georgia at her villa next door,\" Stefan smirked, his eyes twinkling and his nose wrinkled in distaste. \"Apparently she likes reggae.\"</p><p>\"Quit avoiding my question. Can you read minds?\" I asked through clenched teeth. Stefan's smirk deepened and I could feel my blood pressure rising. He needed to start talking and stop the sexy smirking before I exploded. I felt myself begin to tremble in anger and my heart was hammering in my chest as I waited for him to answer me.</p><p>The amusement quickly faded from his eyes and he regarded me with a cautious smile. He took my hand in his, rubbing the top of my hand with his thumb. I watched him warily as he absently stroked my hand.</p><p>\"I cannot read all minds. Just yours and I cannot do that consistently. If your thought is strong enough or there is enough emotion behind the thought, then yes, I can read your mind. Some of your thoughts are quite amusing.\" Stefan grinned widely. \"Your thoughts about 'spontaneous combustion' was actually quite funny, Josephine. I promise I will try to avoid reading your mind if it makes you that uncomfortable. It could be quite valuable if we could learn to communicate this way.\"</p><p>My jaw dropped and I looked at him like he'd suddenly sprouted two heads. My mind was whirling as I replayed our conversation in my mind. He was a vampire, we shared a similar ability and he could read my mind? He's making comments like we're going to be some kind of super power couple, mind-reading and conquering the world together? Would we wear matching capes or costumes?</p><p>\"Josephine, I cannot read your mind right now but I can tell that it is going a million miles a minute.\" Stefan got up from the bed and extended his large hand to me. I looked up at him, my mouth still agape. \"It is still early enough to go out. Shower, dress and I will be waiting for you in the living room.\"</p><p>Brushing Stefan's extended hand aside, I jumped up from the bed and stomped to the bathroom. I didn't look back at him. I knew if I did and saw that smirk on his face, I'd explode. I slammed the door closed and turned on the shower, stepping under the hot spray. Showering quickly, I dried myself off and pulled a comb rapidly through my hair. Wiping off the mirror with the towel, I rubbed moisturizer on my face and dabbed on lip gloss.</p><p>I found that the more I went through my routine, the less angry was at him. I wasn't sure how I felt about this instant relationship I could feel myself sinking into with him. Was he assuming I'd give up everything to follow him around the world on his 'vampire missions?!' The more I considered it, the more I realized I probably would do just that. There was some sort of invisible bond I felt to the vampire that was waiting for me in the other room.</p><p>Angrily stomping my foot in a very Georgia-like fashion at my thoughts, I opened the door to head back to my bedroom. I pulled out a pair of dark blue jeans and an aqua sequined tank top, picking out a matching bra and panties and quickly dressed. Slipping my feet into a pair of low-heeled sandals, I walked over to the full length mirror on my closet door and stopped briefly to put gold hoops through my ear lobes. Even though I was irritated, I had to admit that I'd never looked better. My skin was glowing, my cheeks flushed a soft pink. If this was the side effect of hot sex with a vampire Adonis, I'd gladly sign on for more.</p><p>Looking at my reflection for a final time in the mirror, I took several deep breaths and slowly walked down the hallway to see him sitting cross-legged on my couch. He was flipping through my first published book, 'Harnessing your Inner Psychic'. I stopped to take in the sight before me, feeling a giggle rise in my chest and deflating my remaining anger. It was funny enough trying to figure out how he'd managed to get his six-foot-four body in a cross-legged position on my couch. Seeing him reading a metaphysical self-help book was icing on the proverbial cake.</p><p>I felt my face relax into a large smile and I cleared my throat loudly. \"Feeling the need for some metaphysical self-help?\" I questioned innocently, still fighting my internal giggles.</p><p>Stefan looked up at me, his eyes twinkling. \"I am happy that I amuse you.\" His gaze moved appreciatively over me, not missing one inch of my body. \"You look beautiful, Josephine. Mouth-watering.\"</p><p>Stefan had changed into another pair of jeans and had paired them with a dark gray t-shirt that was as thin as tissue, the muscles of his chest outlined through the transparent material. A shiver moved down my spine as my eyes traced his torso longingly. I wanted to explore his chest with my hands and rip the shirt from him since I knew what was underneath. Shaking my head, I tried to clear my muddled thoughts and stomp down my growing, needy libido.</p><p>\"Are you ready, Romeo?\" I questioned as casually as I could manage, focusing on grabbing my purse and keys from the table. Stefan effortlessly unfolded himself from the couch and walked over join me by the door. He pulled me against the hardness of his body, his lips in my still-damp hair.</p><p>I felt him inhale slightly against me. Was he smelling me?! My body temperature rose when I realized that not only was he smelling me that I liked it. I knew it was time to change direction before dinner and our clothes became a distant memory.</p><p>\"So, where are we going?\" I asked curiously, pulling slightly away from him and tugging at his hand to follow me. We left the house and I stopped long enough for me to lock the door behind us.</p><p>\"A restaurant called 'Deus.' I hear it has acceptable food.\" Stefan wrinkled his nose again. I had to admit that was one of his more adorable facial expressions. A six-foot plus vampire wrinkling his nose was not anything I ever expected to see.</p><p>\"And what are you going to do while I eat? Can you eat?\" I asked as he opened the car door for me, patiently waiting to close it until I'd pulled my legs inside of the small, expensive car. I was amazed that someone his size could squeeze in a car this small. I heard the driver's side door close and I realized just how fast he could move. It took him less than two seconds to make it around the car and get inside. My face must have reflected my shock because he grinned smugly at me.</p><p>\"I cannot eat food. I will send most of my time pushing food on my plate and enjoying your company. Do not worry about me. I plan on eating later, vackra.\" His eyes burned into mine as the double meaning of his words sank in, causing me to squirm uncomfortably in my seat.</p><p>Reaching behind me for the seat belt, I clicked it into place. I tried to arrange my face into something that resembled a smirk, but I probably failed miserably. \"I told you that you need to translate. I don't speak Swedish.\"</p><p>He laughed loudly at my statement and started the car, the engine a quiet purr. \"Soon, vackra. Until then, you will just have to wonder. Du ?r vacker n?r du ?r arg.\"</p><p>I angrily crossed my arms under my chest. He was still laughing as he pulled out of my driveway onto the main road, heading into town.</p><p>We were sitting on the patio at Deus. It was nearly nine o'clock at night and the restaurant/bar was crowded with locals and tourists alike. It was artsy with surf boards and motorcycles on display throughout the building. I picked at my duck salad and greedily sucked down mojitos. Stefan moved chicken wontons around his plate while twisting his mouth in distaste, switching glasses with me when mine would empty, which was quite frequently.</p><p>\"I think you're trying to get me drunk. Is that what you're trying to do?\" I giggled as I downed my second drink, slamming the glass on the table. He smoothly switched drink glasses with me, so quickly that I almost didn't catch the movement of his hand.</p><p>\"Explain what the purpose would be for me to do that, Josephine? We are already well acquainted and I have no need to try to get into your pants,\" Stefan teased, his eyebrows waggling seductively. \"In fact, there are numerous parts of you I would like to revisit.\" He seemed to be distracted by watching me eat and drink, his eyes tracing over the curve of throat as I ate my dinner.</p><p>\"Interesting. Care to share what places you'd like to revisit?\" Biting my lip, I slipped my foot out of my shoe and slowly rubbed my foot up the inside of his leg. Stefan rested his elbows on the table and tented his fingers under his chin, grinning cockily. The alcohol was making me feel very bold and uninhibited. I was just getting ready to lean across the table when a tap on my shoulder interrupted my plans.</p><p>\"Josie Anderson is out two nights in a row? Should I alert the media?\"</p><p>Glancing up, I was stunned to see Anna and her companion of the evening standing at the edge of our table. I rose unsteadily to my feet and hugged Anna briefly, wondering why I hadn't been able to see this happening. This was at least the second time I'd been caught off guard by not having a mental vision to forewarn me. Anna patted me on the shoulder and pushed me back down in my chair, interrupting my inner thoughts. She flipped her dark brown curls over her shoulder, grabbing her date by the arm.</p><p>\"Do you mind if we join you?\" Anna asked, her brown eyes wide as she took in our table. I took a moment to focus on her date, noticing the similarities between Stefan and Mr. No Name that stood beside her.</p><p>He wasn't the kind of man Anna usually chose to date. She normally went for the blond surfer type, the kind of man that was all action and not much of a mental challenge. Her date tonight wasn't as tall or handsome as Stefan and looked to be a few years older, but he had the same iridescent quality to his ivory skin. His short hair was black and his ice blue eyes had a familiar sparkle to them.</p><p>Glancing across the table at Stefan, it was obvious by the look on his face that he knew the mystery man. A tiny smile lifted the corners of his lips and he winked at me.</p><p>\"Please sit down. Josephine and I would love for you to join us. Lukas, it's good to see you,\" Stefan said, motioning to our table. Anna took the seat next to me and Lukas sat down across from Anna, next to Stefan. I had no idea my night out was going to include watching 'VampBook' in action.</p><p>\"My manners are shitty, Josie. This is Lukas Meijer. He came in to look at properties two weeks ago and we struck up a friendship. Yada yada yada, he stopped in today before I left work and asked me to dinner. So, Josie this is Lukas. Lukas, my good friend Josie Anderson that I told you about. And Lukas, it's obvious you know Josie's friend. \" Anna gave Lukas one of her patented death stares. I'd been on the receiving end of one of those looks once and I shivered involuntarily at the memory.</p><p>\"Put that look away, bitch. It won't work on me,\" Lukas lisped in a loud voice. My eyes widened in surprise as I realized that not only was this vampire not Anna's date, he was flamboyantly gay. Lukas grabbed menus from the server that been silently standing by, watching the whole display with wide eyes.</p><p>He handed one to Anna and looked at the server. \"She'll have an Amaretto Sour. And make it a big one so Ms. Bitch here will untighten the knot in her panties,\" Lukas paused for a dramatic effect. \"And I'll have a Cosmopolitan.\"</p><p>\"Of course you'd have a Cosmo. You're gayer than a unicorn farting out a rainbow.\" Anna rolled her eyes at Lukas. I felt another giggle escape from my lips as I looked across the table at Stefan in disbelief. His broad chest was shaking with silent laughter at Anna's cutting remarks. I was beginning to wonder if I was in some sort of Twilight Zone episode. I'm intimately involved with the sexy beast of a vampire seated across from me and now I'm in the presence of a vampire version of a much prettier Rupert Everett. Shaking my head in amused disbelief, I downed the rest of my third mojito in one swallow.</p><p>Anna shot Lukas another black look before opening her menu. \"If I hadn't had to listen to you whine like a little bitch for the last hour and a half I wouldn't be in this mood, Lukas.\"</p><p>Lukas cocked his head to the side and sniffed, busying himself in studying his menu. I put my chin in the palm of my hand that rested on the table, my eyes darting back and forth as they bickered. I swallowed another giggle, deciding it was time to enter the conversation.</p><p>\"So how do you know Stefan, Lukas?\" I asked him, watching as Stefan's smile disappeared and he sent Lukas a look of caution.</p><p>He shot Stefan a pointed look, then focused on me after he closed his menu and placed in on the table in front of him. \"Stefan and I worked on a project together many years ago. We struck up a friendship and the rest is history.\" He puckered his lips at Stefan. \"I'm hurt that you didn't mention me to Josie. I thought we were better friends, Stefan.\" Lukas made a production of pulling his napkin out and wiping a non-existent tear away from his eye.</p><p>Stefan sighed heavily and rubbed his hand over his face in response to Lukas' theatrics, leaving me to wonder if I was in the presence of the gayest man, or should I say vampire, in the world.</p><p>Anna didn't try to hide her very visible eye roll. \"Lukas. Take it down 15 notches on the Drama Queen scale. I still need to be able to eat tonight.\"</p><p>The server returned with their drinks and Stefan pointed to his empty drink glass, silently requesting another drink. I shook my head at Stefan, picking up my glass and taking a tiny sip.</p><p>Lukas and Anna ordered appetizers, and after the server left Anna turned to face me in her chair. She'd known me for quite some time and she had never known of me to even give the time of day to any man in Bali. Her curiosity and confusion was so strong that I had to slam my shield into place to block her.</p><p>\"I see Georgia didn't have to kick Stefan's ass this morning. I'm assuming all hair was accounted for?\" Anna asked snarkily, stirring her drink with the tiny straw and raising it to take a deep swallow.</p><p>\"Yes. Georgia was overjoyed to see that Josephine was in good hands when she used her key and entered Josephine's villa this morning. Uninvited,\" Stefan replied dryly. He stared at me intensely and I could feel the heat and lust rushing through that one burning look. My stomach did a flip flop as I thought of different ways to undress him later, uncomfortably crossing my legs under the table.</p><p>\"That's Georgia. Accept it now, it'll be easier for you than fighting it,\" Anna said as she finished her drink. She started looking around for the server to get a refill. \"Lukas, I'm going to the bathroom. If our server comes around, get me another drink please.\" She slid away from the table and disappeared inside the restaurant. Lukas waited for Anna to get out of hearing range and then turned to Stefan.</p><p>\"So this is the mystery woman.\" Lukas looked at me critically. He was quiet for a moment as he focused on me and turned his head from side to side, making me feel like I was under a microscope. I realized that this \"dinner date\" was no surprise by his comments and obvious scrutiny. \"She's as stunning as you described she'd be. I'm assuming she knows.\"</p><p>\"Yes. She knows of what we are. She is extremely perceptive. And beautiful,\" Stefan responded in a low voice, reaching across the table to take my hand. I shot Stefan a look filled with ire, a flush creeping across my cheeks. I hated being talked about as if I wasn't there, like I was a child that was incapable of keeping up with the conversation. Stefan raised an eyebrow, seemingly surprised at my sudden irritation.</p><p>\"Hello, I'm sitting right here! You don't have to talk about me like I'm not here!\" I exclaimed loudly. Stefan's thumb rubbed a calming circle on the palm of the hand he was holding and Lukas observed my display with an excited giggle, his eyes twinkling.</p><p>\"I like her. She passes,\" Lukas said as he clasped his hands together. \"Oh, Josie. I thought he'd never find you. I was starting to think he was crazy.\"</p><p>Letting out a muffled laugh, my mouth twitched in response to Lukas' statement. Stefan was the crazy one?!? I'd witnessed more drama and craziness from Lukas in the last 30 minutes than I had all day.</p><p>The server approached with Anna's food and Stefan's drink and Lukas took the opportunity to place a new drink order for Anna. After the server left, he leaned around Stefan to pour half of his drink onto the patio. He picked up a few of the wontons gingerly with his fingers and placed them into his napkin, wadding it up and tossing it under the table. He placed one on his plate and then turned to Stefan again. It was apparent that I was getting a crash course in Vampire Eating 101.</p><p>\"The Council will want to meet her,\" Lukas advised simply as he turned his attention to me. \"Has he explained the Council to you?\"</p><p>Stefan's face darkened. \"I have only known her for a day, Lukas. I mentioned the Council. There is no reason to scare her. Enough,\" Stefan muttered, his handsome face becoming severe and frightening.</p><p>For the first time, he looked like a vampire to me.</p><p>Lukas bowed his head and sat back in his chair. I was scared about whatever this 'Council' was, but I was turned on by the sense of power that Stefan had over Lukas. Stefan's nostrils flared, smelling my arousal. I sighed and self-consciously pressed my legs together, wondering if I was the human equivalent of a plug-in for him.</p><p>Stefan must have read my thoughts because his face lightened and he chuckled quietly in response.</p><p>I looked up to see Anna approaching the table, the server behind her with her drink. \"It's about fucking time. I was wondering what a girl had to do to get a refill,\" Anna announced to the table. \"And I see you started eating without me, Lukas. Don't you need to watch your girlish figure?\"</p><p>Anna was one of those people that made you either laugh or cry with her biting sarcasm. She took no mercy on anyone.</p><p>\"I'm sure it would be nothing you haven't already done. Sit your bitchy ass down and drink your drink,\" Lukas retorted loudly, causing her to shoot Lukas another look. Vampires must be immune to Anna's death stare because Lukas simply rolled his eyes and pushed the drink closer to her.</p><p>Stefan and I stayed for another hour, mainly to laugh at Lukas and Anna. I soaked up Anna's happiness like a sponge. She was thrilled to have finally found her gay friend here in Bali. Lukas alternated between lamenting over his lack of love life and exchanging snarky barbs with Anna. Finally calling it a night, we paid the bill and made our way to our respective vehicles.</p><p>Anna pulled me into a hug. \"Stop by the office. We can chat about sex on a stick over there.\" She jerked her head towards Stefan as she whispered in my ear.</p><p>Hugging her back, I pulled away to give her a non-committal smile. \"I'll do that.\"</p><p>Stefan came up behind me and wrapped his long arms around my shoulders, resting his chin on the top of my head. I leaned back against him, enjoying his cool embrace.</p><p>\"No you won't. But I still love you like a sister.\"</p><p>I shrugged and smiled weakly. Anna knew me too well.</p><p>\"Anna. It was a pleasant surprise seeing you again this evening. Lukas, be safe getting her home,\" Stefan said, tugging me towards his Audi and opening the door for me. I waved goodbye to Anna as Stefan to slide into the driver's seat. He started the car and headed down the road to my villa. We had barely been driving for a minute when I started asking questions.</p><p>\"Explain why I would need to meet the Council?\" I wasn't waiting for Stefan to explain this to me in a smooth, sugar coated version. I needed more information and I didn't want to wait for him to decide when he wanted to explain it to me.</p><p>\"They know of you, of course. Other vampires have talents, Josephine. A telepathic vampire was able to see my vision of you many years ago,\" Stefan murmured, his voice quiet. I silently scanned his face, illuminated by the interior lights on the dashboard. \"You would be a powerful ally for us to have. You have the ability to see what I cannot, which is the future of humans.\"</p><p>I swallowed back a gasp, a mixture of anger and fear making my blood run cold. I was going to be used to read the futures of humans for vampires? My stomach churned and I felt like I was going to vomit.</p><p>\"Is this the real reason you found me? You and your 'Council' need me to read humans?\" I spat, feeling my eyes fill with angry tears. Without thinking, I went into panic mode. I knew it was too good to be true. I'd been lied to once again. Stefan and his vampires would use me like a toy, only to be thrown away when my usefulness had run its course. When I felt the car come to a stop and pull slightly off the road, my jaw was clenched in anger.</p><p>\"It is nothing like that,\" Stefan said, his voice strained. I ignored him and stared straight ahead, refusing to meet his eyes. \"Josephine, please look at me.\"</p><p>I turned my head slightly to look at him, my expression hard. Stefan's handsome face was pained, his eyes fearful. I felt my resolve soften slightly as I took in his appearance.</p><p>\"You must believe me when I tell you that was never my intention. I have loved you for over two centuries. I never searched for you just to find you and use you,\" Stefan hesitated for a moment, his voice thick with emotion. \"Josephine, you have to believe me. What can I do to make you to trust me?\"</p><p>Hot tears leaked from my eyes in earnest. I may not be able to read Stefan's emotions but I could see them as if they were written on his face. He was tense and worry flashed in his eyes. He was possibly more afraid than I was at the moment.</p><p>\"Prove to me that you're telling me the truth and give me time to trust you,\" I whispered in the darkness of the car.</p><p>Stefan smiled, the stress leaving his face. \"I can do both. I have all the time in the world, vackra.\"</p><p>The car began to move again and I let my head fall back against the head rest. I sighed softly when I felt his hand take mine, intertwining our fingers together.</p><p>A small smile broke across my face as he squeezed my hand gently. My heart skipped a beat as I my mind drifted back over the only part of our conversation that really mattered to me. He had said he had loved me for over 200 years.</p><p>He loved me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stefan made the sharp turn into my driveway, his behavior filled with trepidation. The remainder of the trip home had been silent except for the sound of the wind blowing in through the open windows. He stopped the car and turned off the engine and made no attempt to move.</p><p>Without waiting for him, I climbed out of the car and closed the door behind me.</p><p>I tilted my face up to stare at the moon shining brightly in the sky, breathing in the humid air. It was a welcome respite from the tension hanging over us during the ride back to my house.</p><p>Stepping onto the porch, I turned to see him still sitting in his car. I shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot as I contemplated what to do. I wasn't good with situations like this. I'd shielded myself from getting close to anyone for this reason. Yet here I was, neck deep in some sort of relationship with a 975 year old vampire.</p> <p>Karma truly is a bitch.</p><p>Dropping my purse on the porch steps, I walked back towards the car. I leaned my arms against the driver's side door and waited for him to look at me. His gaze was fixed straight ahead, appearing to be lost in thought.</p><p>It was up to me to attempt to fix this situation since he wouldn't even look at me, let alone attempt to have a conversation about it. This should be interesting since I have no experience repairing any kind of relationship.</p><p>\"Want to come inside?\" I asked softly. He finally turned to look at me, a skeptical look flashing across his face. I gave him a small smile as I reached out to stroke his face, my fingers lightly cupping his cheek. He leaned his head slightly into the warmth of my hand.</p><p>\"You want me to come inside?\" Stefan questioned in a low, composed voice.</p> <p>\"I think I already asked you that. Please come inside, Stefan.\"</p><p>The car door opened and Stefan got out of the car. As he stood beside me his tall, muscular frame towered over me and I had to crane my neck to look up at his face. His blond hair shined like gold and his skin was glowing in the moonlight. It was a moment like this when I struggled to grasp why he wanted to be with me when he could have anyone he wanted.</p><p>\"I only want you, vackra. For 200 years, I have only desired you. I meant what I said earlier, Josephine. I have loved-\" Stefan said hoarsely. I placed my hand gently over his mouth to stop his words.</p><p>\"Enough talking for now. Come inside before Georgia hears us and wants to have a sleepover,\" I whispered roughly. I couldn't bear to hear him say those words again. My heart couldn't take it.</p><p>I walked back to the steps and bent to pick up my purse as I walked by. Fishing out my keys, I unlocked the door and went inside. I glanced over my shoulder to see he was still standing by the car, his face inscrutable in the moonlight.</p><p>I switched on the lamp on the table, tossing my purse and keys haphazardly on the table. Turning, I walked outside to rejoin him and brushed my hands over his arms and shoulders lightly. He closed his eyes and I watched his throat as he swallowed hard in response. My fingers ran over the skin of his neck, tracing a finger over his Adam's apple.</p> <p>\"Here's the thing Stefan, I'm not good at this. I've never wanted to take the time to be in a relationship with anyone and now I'm in this complicated one with an immortal man that is absolutely gorgeous. He tells me things I thought weren't true and couldn't happen. Did I mention he drives me crazy in a good sort of way?\" My hands slipped under his shirt to rub his chest and stomach and his muscles tightened under the movement of my hands. \"So could you please come inside with me? I need you.\"</p><p>\"You have had too much to drink,\" Stefan muttered, his lips set in a hard line. \"I do not want to you to regret anything.\"</p><p>A small laugh escaped from my lips. \"And exactly whose fault would that be? I know exactly what I'm doing, Stefan. I said I need you. The only thing I'll regret is if you leave right now.\"</p><p>Seconds passed by and I could see Stefan's reluctance begin to waver. I put all the emotion I could behind my thought. \"Do it. Just kiss me already.\"</p><p>Stefan head snapped to look at me, his blue eyes glowing as if they were on fire. His hands were rough as he grabbed my face with both of his hands, his lips hard and searching against mine. His tongue flicked out to meet my own and he lifted me effortlessly in his arms. My legs locked around his waist and he wrapped his arms around me. He carried me into the house and kicked the front door closed behind us.</p><p>The kiss intensified as we made the short trip to the couch. He sat down and I tucked my legs to straddle him, feeling his large erection press against the heat between my legs. I wrapped my arms around his neck and let my fingers snake up into his silky, golden hair. I tugged it gently with my hands and he moaned into my mouth, pulling me closer.</p><p>Moving my lips from his, I pressed kisses along his jaw, stopping just below his lips. His tongue flicked out in anticipation, grazing slowly along his lower lip. When he flicked his tongue out again, I touched my tongue to his. One of his hands went to my hair, turning my head so he could deepen the kiss. His other hand rubbed underneath my tank top to caress my lower back.</p><p>I lifted my mouth away from his to grab the bottom of my shirt and I pulled it over my head, my hair tumbling around my shoulders in a tumble of waves. Standing slowly, I unzipped my jeans. Stefan leaned forward and he pushed them over my legs. He ran his tongue sensuously over his lip again as his eyes roamed over my nearly naked body. I raised a single eyebrow in defiance, turning on my heel and began to walk towards my bedroom. I'd only made it halfway down the hall when his large hands pushed me against the wall, his breath cool against the skin of my neck. One of his hands wound in my hair to slightly pull my head back, exposing my neck to the caress of his lips.</p> <p>\"Going somewhere, Josephine?\" Stefan whispered seductively, his lilting voice crashing over me like a tidal wave. My hands fumbled with the buttons on his jeans and his cock sprang free after I struggled to release the final one. I wrapped my hands around him, stroking him gently. He let out a low growl and I released him long enough to push the jeans down around his feet. He absently kicked them away as I quickly sank to my knees to take him into my mouth. I ran my tongue down his entire cock, feeling it twitch when I placed my wet mouth over the head, twirling my tongue around him.</p><p>His hands moved to my hair and I looked up through my eyelashes to see his eyes fixated on my mouth. I greedily pulled him deeper into my mouth and throat, hollowing my cheeks around him. I continued to lick and suck him, the moans and groans he uttered only spurred my need to go faster and to make him moan louder. I let my fingers slowly drift to brush against his balls as I continued to steadily suck him. A shudder that shook his whole body reverberated in my mouth, making me moan from the sensation.</p><p>\"Your mouth, Josephine. It is too much. I cannot do this right now,\" Stefan snarled as he pulled out of my mouth and picked me up to carry me into the bedroom. He roughly dropped me on the bed, his eyes filled with need as he gazed at me. He grabbed the neck of his t-shirt and ripped it down the middle with one hand and let the pieces drop to the floor.</p><p>I brazenly let my eyes sweep over the length of his lean body, feeling a delicious shiver of want run throughout my body as he stood naked before me. He was a blur as he slid between my legs effectively pinning me against the bed. His long fingers smoothed over the sides of my panties, using both fingers to snap apart the sides. A sly smile was on his lips as he lowered his head between my breasts, biting my bra apart with his teeth. His large hands brushed the lacy material away and he softly palmed my breasts for a moment, his fingers slowly pinching my hardened nipples.</p><p>He sat back on his knees and made no attempt to hide the fact that he was watching me with eyes that were almost black with need. Delicious excitement consumed me under the weight of his stare, his hooded eyes focusing on the slick heat of my wet sex. The smoldering fire I was feeling between my legs was magnified by the calculating expression on his chiseled face.</p><p>\"Do you want me to fuck you or eat your pussy, Josephine?\" Stefan asked, his voice uneven and deep. \"Tell me what you want.\"</p><p>I let out a deep moan, my head dropping back against the bed. \"Stefan, fuck....I can't...I want it all.\"</p><p>Stefan ran his fingers over the wetness of my pussy, watching as my hips bucked wildly with desperation. His mouth lowered to devour my swollen clit, my hands violently clutching the sheets in response to the sensation of his mouth on me. He slid a long finger inside of me, joined by a second, teasing as they stroked and curled within my moist depths. My back arched and I tightened around him, his fingers slipping in the slick wetness.</p><p>His tongue strayed to lave over my inner thigh and his fangs sank into my tender skin. I cried out in pleasure from the combination from his bite and his fingers rubbing inside of me, coaxing me to climax. I felt him swallow and I shuddered around his fingers, his tongue flickering over the punctures to seal them.</p><p>His hips settled in between my thighs and his hard cock plunged inside of me with no warning. My hips rose to meet his first thrust as his body molded to mine, our hips moving in a frenzied tempo. He nudged my head to the side to slowly run his tongue and teeth over my neck possessively.</p><p>\"Stefan!\" I cried out as my fingernails clawed against the muscles of his arms. I felt the skin loosen under my fingertips, causing his blood to run slowly down his arms. As if in a daze, my head moved to to lick the blood that had escaped from the slowly healing scratches, groaning at the bittersweet taste of him. He howled in desire, flipping me over so my ass was exposed to him. He slammed back inside of me, the only sounds in the room was his animalistic grunting, my loud moans and our skin making contact as he forcefully pounded into me.</p><p>\"Oh god...harder!\" I screamed breathlessly, tears running from my eyes from the pleasure of being owned by him. He pulled my hips back against him faster and spread my legs wider so his cock slid deeper inside of me. My breasts pressed against the bed and I felt my inner walls begin to tighten around him, clenching his cock tightly as I came around him. I cried out incoherently in ecstasy when I felt his hands grip my hips tighter and he pulsed inside me with a bellowing yell.</p><p>\"Knulla det!\" His spent body slumped over me, pulling my back against his chest. He had burrowed his nose into the crook of my neck when he smelled the salt from my tears.</p><p>\"You are crying? Did I hurt you? Stefan asked, alarmed. He rolled us over and his eyes darted over my body, looking for injuries. Unable to form a coherent answer, I simply shook my head which caused an arrogant grin to break over his face. He stroked one of his large hands lovingly over the outside of my thigh. \"Then they are happy tears. I can live with that.\"</p><p>\"Technically you aren't alive, Romeo.\" I muttered softly. He rolled onto his back and rubbed his hand over his face in exasperation. I turned to face him, draping myself across his chest. \"I love...I...\"</p><p>As much as I wanted to tell him I loved him, I couldn't say the words. I felt a tear escape from the corner of my eye as I buried my face against the coolness of his chest, unable to look at him. I was a coward. I loved him and was too scared to say the words.</p><p>His hand lifted my chin to search my red-rimmed eyes. His smile was gentle as he lowered his lips to capture mine in a soft, loving kiss.</p><p>\"You do not have to say it now, Josephine,\" Stefan murmured softly against my lips. \"You will say the words when you are ready. Always know that I will love you eternally.\"</p><p>He wrapped me in the strong embrace of his arms and rocked me gently as I sobbed against his chest.</p><p>I woke up to the sound of rain splattering against the window, the gloomy light of an overcast sky darkening my bedroom. I stretched and rolled over, expecting to see Stefan stretched out beside of me. His side of the bed was empty, a note sitting on his vacant pillow. I sat up and reached over to pick it up.</p><p>Josephine-</p><p>I am sorry I will not be here to see the beauty of your face when you awake. I will count the moments until I return to you...</p><p>Stefan</p><p>I read the note twice, running my fingers over his elegant handwriting and held the note to my nose to see if I could smell his scent on the paper. I rolled my eyes, mentally berating myself for my behavior. I was acting like I was the heroine in a vampire version of a Harlequin romance novel, swooning and smelling a piece of paper he had written the note on. Sighing heavily, I reviewed the previous night in my head, groaning when I remembered that I couldn't bring myself to tell him I loved him. I was pathetic. He told me he'd love me eternally and I cried against his chest like a scared little girl.</p><p>It was true. I did love him. I didn't make it a habit to attach myself to anyone, yet within days I'd made a 180 degree turn. Now I was in love with a vampire and smelling his notes in the off-chance that I could smell his scent on the paper? Had I lost my mind?</p><p>Throwing back the covers in disgust, I made my way into the bathroom. As I brushed my teeth, my eyes passed over my reflection in the mirror and I did a double take. My hair, even in its disheveled, 'I was fucked by a six-foot-four sex god' state was bouncy and had a sheen to it that could never be achieved by any shampoo or conditioner. My skin was glowing and my green eyes sparkled back at me in the mirror. I watched my hand trace my much plumper lips in the reflection of the mirror. I looked like I'd spent hours at a spa. What the hell is going on?</p><p>My cell phone rang, causing me to jump and tear my eyes away from the mirror. I sprinted down the hallway to unplug my cell phone from the charger, not bothering to look at the phone. I knew it was Georgia calling to berate me for not calling her.</p><p>\"Hello, Georgia.\"</p><p>\"You know, you were supposed to call me. I'm sure you were too busy with Hunky McHunkerson to remember little old me.\" I could hear almost hear Georgia's pout over the phone.</p><p>\"I know, I know. Time got away from me. We're talking now, so what's up?\"</p><p>\"'What's up!? I'll tell you what's up,\" Georgia mocked, her voice incredulous. \"I just talked to Anna. Obviously you and Mr. Hunky are serious since you were mooning all over each other at dinner last night. What the hell is going on? And now is not the time to feed me a line of bullshit either, Josie.\"</p><p>\"He has a name, Georgia. It's Stefan. And yes, it's serious. I think.\" I busied myself filling up a kettle with water, placing it on the burner to boil water for coffee. I scooped coffee into my French press and waited for Georgia to continue.</p><p>\"You think it's serious? I don't like to get in your business but...\"</p><p>\"Really? I would have never known by this conversation. You've been all about being in my business for two days,\" I retorted sharply. \"I like him. A lot. I don't know where this is going but I'm not going to push him away.\"</p><p>I was being a coward again by saying I liked him. I loved him. I loved how he made my stomach flip like an infatuated school girl when I saw him. I loved how he made me want to pull my hair out and then jump him. And I even loved his aggravating smirk and swagger...yeah, I especially loved his swagger. Yum.</p><p>Georgia sighed into the phone. \"Whatever, Josie. This isn't like you, honey. I'm running into town. Wanna join me?\" The water boiled, and I poured the hot water over the coffee in the press.</p><p>\"Give me twenty minutes. I do need to grab some groceries.\"</p><p>\"See ya, chick.\"</p><p>I hit 'end' on my phone and shook my head, closing my eyes in exasperation. Georgia took twenty minutes to mean fifteen. I ran back down the hallway to start the shower.</p><p>I was walking up the hallway after my quick shower and brief primping session to find Georgia and Anna both sitting in the living room, pointedly looking at my clothes that still littered the living room floor. It was obvious this was going to a double interrogation, a surreal version of bad cop, bad cop, neither taking my side since they both wanted the dirt. I immediately decided to feign ignorance since it didn't take psychic abilities to know what was going to happen.</p><p>\"Coffee?\" I asked as I darted around the kitchen, getting cups and sugar out of the cupboards.</p><p>Georgia and Anna's heels clacked over the wood floor as they made their way into the kitchen. I was nervously waiting for the questions to begin.</p><p>\"Sure,\" Georgia said, pulling out a chair and sitting down at the table in the kitchen. Anna nodded and sat down across from Georgia. \"It looks like you had an eventful night, honey.\"</p><p>Pouring coffee into three cups, I passed cups to both of them. I took my time spooning sugar into my mug, stirring my coffee with my spoon and placing it on the napkin I'd pulled from the basket. I focused on my coffee, shrugging nonchalantly.</p><p>\"I have to admit you look gorgeous,\" Anna said, her eyes taking in my hair and skin. \"You look like you've been properly fucked. It looks good on you.\"</p><p>\"Anna,\" I warned, my eyes narrowing. I took a deep drink of coffee and fought off an exasperated sigh.</p><p>\"Ok, ok. Don't tell me!\" Anna waved her hands in surrender, rolling her eyes in exasperation. I thought she'd given up when she leaned in over her coffee cup. \"Just tell me one thing, Josie. Please tell me he's packing. Someone that is that huge has to be packing. And I can tell by the way he moves that he knows how to use it.\"</p><p>\"Anna!\" I groaned, dropping my face into my hands. \"I'm going to say this once. Once! And I will never admit I told you anything.\" I set my gaze on Anna. \"Yes, he's 'packing.' And yes, he knows how to use it. Multiple times.\"</p><p>Georgia and Anna looked at each other and squealed in delight. Georgia clapped her hands together like she just found out she had the winning lottery ticket.</p><p>\"I knew it!\" Anna said smugly, smoothing her curls with her hand. She finished her coffee and stood up. \"Let's go. We have places to go.\"</p><p>Draining my coffee cup, I pushed away from the table. Where was Stefan when you needed him?</p><p>We piled into Georgia's sedan and made the short trip into town. There was a small market that sold fresh produce and farther in was a small row of shops. We split up, each doing our respective shopping. I made sure my shields were in place and enjoyed the first alone moments that I'd had for the last few days. I was deep in thought and contemplating buying a dark purple silk dress with a halter style neckline when Anna rejoined me.</p><p>\"That would look fabulous on you. You should get it,\" Anna said, turning her head to the side and admiring the dress. \"Look, I don't know what's going on with you and Stefan and I'm not going to bug you about it. I think it's long overdue that you met someone. Does he know?\"</p><p>Nodding to Anna, I took the dress down from the hook it was hanging on, double checking the size. I carried the dress to the clerk, waited for her to ring it up, paid and grabbed the bag. Anna was hot on my heels as we left the store.</p><p>\"He knows. He's very observant.\" I shrugged as Anna linked arms with me. We walked slowly to Georgia's car, content in idle conversation and people watching.</p><p>\"He's something. Sex on two legs for sure. Wanna know what I noticed last night? For the first time, you looked really happy.\" Anna smiled at me. I gave her another shrug and we leaned against the car, waiting for Georgia to join us.</p><p>\"I like him, Anna. A lot,\" I said quietly and paused, watching Anna's reaction briefly. I could feel Anna's happiness for me. \"So we'll see what happens.\"</p><p>Anna laughed, waving her hand. \"Lukas is under the impression that Stefan is ready to ride off into the sunset with you. I can only imagine the size of the horse that would take to hold him. One more thing. Please tell me that Stefan has a twin, or an equally gorgeous friend that's not gay. Lie to me if you have to.\"</p><p>I didn't have a chance to answer as Georgia decided to make her appearance, her arms loaded down with bags.</p><p>\"Y'all ready to go?\" Georgia didn't wait for an answer. She unlocked the doors and we piled inside again, this time heading towards home.</p><p>It was early evening when Georgia pulled into my driveway, much later than I'd intended to stay out. Stefan was pacing the front porch, almost a little too quickly to appear human. I was going to have to remind him that I had human friends. Very perceptive human friends.</p><p>\"It looks like someone is nervous,\" Georgia observed, glancing over at me. I pursed my lips and shrugged. I had no experience when it came to nervous boyfriends. Did you call a 975 year old vampire a boyfriend?</p><p>I couldn't help but smile when I saw the look of relief flash across Stefan's face when he saw me in the car with Georgia. He stepped off the porch and had my car door open before the she'd completely stopped.</p><p>\"Hey, stranger,\" I whispered as Stefan grabbed me to him impatiently. Pulling back to look at him, I realized that now that he knew that he knew I was safe, he was angry. This sort of behavior was not going to work with me. The last thing I needed was a vampire bodyguard.</p><p>\"I was worried. I came back and you were gone. Perhaps if you had left a note, I would have known where you were, Josephine.\"</p><p>Georgia was out around the car quickly, her arms crossed. \"Perhaps if you weren't up her ass 24 hours a day and had something productive to do you wouldn't need to worry about her. She does have a life outside of you, Mr. Hunky McHunkerson.\" Georgia was just getting warmed up, taking her index finger and poking him in his chest. \"You showed up on the scene two, count them, TWO days ago and now you think you need to know where she is at all times? Not happening. You obviously think you're much more important than you really are. I think someone needs an attitude adjustment.\"</p><p>\"Georgia!\" I looked at Georgia sharply. I'd unfortunately seen this side of Georgia before. She was full of anger and was ready to come out with guns blasting. I was usually able to diffuse the situation since I could normally see it happening and could easily divert the situation. I was wondering why I didn't see Georgia doing this. She's normally easy to read although I'd been blindsided again.</p><p>Stefan raised up to his full six-foot-four height and leaned in close to her, his upper lip curled up into a snarl. To give Georgia credit, she stood her ground but she was looking at me for help out of the corner of her eye. I could feel the panic rolling off of her in waves as she tensed beside of me. Snorting, I grabbed Stefan's hand to try to get his attention.</p><p>Leave it to Georgia to start something she couldn't finish.</p><p>\"Stefan,\" I soothed, concentrating on staying as calm as possible. His gaze was still focused on Georgia. I waited a moment and squeezed his hand again. \"Stefan, please.\"</p><p>Stefan snapped his head around to look at me, his lip still curled up in a snarl. Managing a shaky smile, I squeezed his hand again. Only his lip relaxed, anger still darkened his handsome face. The swooning romance novel heroine inside of me was already thinking of the angry sex we would be having soon and was mentally clapping. I needed to get a grip on my hormones, since it was obvious Stefan was close to snapping.</p><p>\"Please, Stefan. Help me carry my bags in?\"</p><p>Stefan followed me to the back of the car, where I pointed out my four bags. I started to grab two of them and he brushed my hand away impatiently, grabbing all four of them and stalking into the house, his posture stiff.</p><p>\"Shit, Josie. I think I pissed Hunky off,\" Georgia whispered, one of her hands shaking as she tucked her dark hair behind her ear.</p><p>I looked at Georgia incredulously. \"You think, Georgia? I thought I was going to have to referee for a minute.\" I was panicking because I had no idea how this was going to work out. Georgia's future was black.</p><p>\"I'm sorry. Maybe I should leave and let you two work it out,\" Georgia offered quickly, starting to turn to walk to the driver's side of her car.</p><p>\"No.\" Both of Georgia and I jumped at Stefan's silent return. I could hear how heavily accented his voice sounded in that single syllable. I went to stand in front of Stefan, hoping that I would be enough to keep Stefan away from Georgia.</p><p>\"Listen to me, Georgia Turner. I may be 'new on the scene' in Josephine's life. However, I was concerned when she was not here when I returned. You may find it acceptable and humorous to chastise other men for their shortcomings. You will not stand here and do that to me. Perhaps I did overreact, that I will agree with. Under no circumstance do you get in my face again. Do we understand each other?\"</p><p>Georgia nodded, swallowing hard. I knew my mouth was gaping in awe. I'd never seen Georgia surrender without a fight. Of course, she'd never had to face the wrath of a six-foot-four angry vampire either.</p><p>Stefan let a small smile break over his face, combing his fingers through his hair and his posture visibly relaxing. He placed his hands on my shoulders and rubbed them softly. I let out a sigh of relief that he'd calmed down and Georgia was safe.</p><p>\"Good. I am going inside to let the two of you say your goodbyes. Georgia.\" He inclined his blond head and I watched as his broad shoulders disappeared inside the house. Georgia looked at me, her eyes wide. I stifled a laugh despite the seriousness of the situation. I'd never felt this kind of remorse from Georgia before.</p><p>Georgia hugged me quickly in goodbye, started her sedan and was down the driveway like a bat out of hell. I closed my eyes for a moment, taking in a deep breath before heading inside of the house to face Stefan.</p><p>Walking into the house, I quietly closed the door behind me. I wasn't looking forward to this discussion with Stefan and my stomach churned in disapproval. I felt him move to stand behind me and I kept my back to him, my body rigid.</p><p>\"I am sorry,\" Stefan admitted, his voice soft. \"I am an idiot.\"</p><p>\"Yes, you are an idiot.\" I spun on my heel and brushed past him, walking to the kitchen and began unpacking my bags. I chose to ignore his brooding, intense stare as his eyes followed my movements. I hummed as I put away produce, opening and closing cabinet doors as I finished putting groceries away. His large frame was leaning in the doorway, watching me intently.</p><p>\"I've been alone for a long time, Stefan. The last thing I need is someone to tell me what to do and babysit me. Did you ever think that I don't bother to leave notes because no one has been around to read them for a long time?\"</p><p>\"I apologized, Josephine. Now you are supposed to accept my apology and we move on.\"</p><p>I couldn't hold back my barking laugh. \"Really, Stefan? Is that how this is supposed to work?\" I made a back and forth gesture with my hand between us. \"You get to act like a jackass and I'm supposed to accept it and we just move on?\" I walked up to him, craning my neck to look into his eyes. \"I'm not sure which cheesy romance novel you are getting your information from but that's not always how it works. I get to be pissed off.\" I pointed to my chest and pushed him out of my way, stomping past him into the living room. I sat down on the couch and tucked my legs underneath me, my fingertips tapping out an angry rhythm on my leg.</p><p>Stefan was silent as he walked to the sliding glass door that led to the back patio. His eyes were focused on the landscape outside, his posture rigid. I watched him for a moment as his jaw clenched in frustration. I let out a small sigh and felt my own anger wane. I was beginning to realize it was going to be impossible to stay angry at him.</p><p>\"You are human, Josephine. You are fragile and breakable and at any moment I could lose you. I am sorry that I overreacted, but I cannot lose you. Not now. Not ever.\"</p><p>Rising from the couch, I crossed the living room to stand behind him, wrapping my arms around his narrow waist. He stiffened slightly as I pressed up against him.</p><p>\"I'm fine and I have the right to be pissed off, Stefan. Sometimes I think we're miles apart in the way we think.\"</p><p>He relaxed slightly, his chest rumbling with his responding chuckle. \"Ah, Josephine. That we can agree upon.\" He took one of my hands and led me back to the couch, sitting down and pulling me onto his lap. I rested my head on his solid chest, waiting for him to continue.</p><p>His voice was steady and deliberate when he spoke. \"I am ready to move on with my life now that I have found you, Josephine. I have searched, waited and loved you for two centuries. I have been patient,\" Stefan paused, drawing in an unnecessary breath. \"I have found you and I do not want to play games. Be with me, love me and let us progress. Is that too much to ask of you?\"</p><p>Was it too much to ask? I'd been alone a long time, even prior to my adoptive parents' death four years ago. I'd never been normal, so why would my first and possibly last relationship be normal? I was still attempting to baby-step my way into this situation instead of blindly jumping into the deep end like he was expecting me to do with no reservations.</p><p>\"Stefan, let me tell you what my life was like prior to meeting you and letting you turn it upside down.\" He rhythmically began stroking my hair and I closed my eyes, enjoying the feel of his hands in my hair. \"I was alone, with the exception of Georgia and Anna. My adoptive parents died four years ago in a car accident. I can't locate my birth parents no matter how much money I spend or how hard I search. I move from place to place and I never settle down. I'm used to being alone and then you sweep in and I'm supposed to just go with the flow? That's sort of is the opposite of how I operate.\"</p><p>Stefan pressed his lips against the top of my head. \"Yet I am over 900 years old and can change. Explain what you want from me, Josephine.\"</p><p>Laughing deeply, I wrapped my arms around his neck. \"There are many things I want from you. But I need time. Time to adjust to us. I need to get used to being in a relationship.\"</p><p>He nodded. \"Then I will give you time. You have to promise to meet me halfway, Josephine.\"</p><p>I swallowed the lump that had risen in my throat. My mouth was dry when I finally spoke. \"I promise.\"</p><p>\"Now is the part of the cheesy romance novel where we kiss and make up, yes?\" Stefan asked, his eyebrows waggling and blue eyes twinkling with humor.</p><p>\"Kiss me, you big idiot.\"</p><p>I didn't have to ask him twice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I was listening to the rumbling thunder as I lay draped across Stefan's hard, muscular chest. His face looked peaceful and innocent as he slept, his long lashes casting shadows under his eyes. I lightly kissed his cheek and rolled out of bed, yawning as I stopped to grab clothes from the closet. My eyes took note of his large duffel bag that was prominently displayed on the chaise lounge in the corner of the room. This was going to be one of those moments where I was going to have to adapt and meet him halfway without panicking. I walked over to his bag and ran my finger across the handle. I just needed to keep reminding myself that he loves me and wants to be with me. That's all that should really matter.</p><p>But there was more at stake than just knowing he loved me. He was making me break all of my rules, forcing me to do all of the things I said I'd never do.</p><p>Like fall in love.</p><p>Sighing deeply, I pulled on a tank and capri yoga pants and walked barefoot into the living room. I decided to take advantage of the quiet and the time alone to meditate and turn off my over-thinking mind for a little while. Unrolling my mat, I stretched briefly and settled down on the floor to clear my thoughts. It took much longer than usual for my mind to settle and relax.</p> <p>I'd lost track of time when I felt the hum of Stefan's presence in the room. I opened my eyes lazily to look up at him, my heart lurching wildly as my eyes roamed over his body. He was leaning his shoulder against the door frame, his straight blond hair sweeping across his forehead and his arms were crossed against his massive chest. He was completely naked, his blue eyes boring into mine.</p><p>My eyes immediately drifted south to focus on his semi-hard cock, a delightful shiver of want running through my body. My mouth went dry and my panties flooded with moisture as I boldly stared at him from my mat.</p><p>I could count relaxing any part of my body out of the equation now.</p><p>Squeezing my eyes closed, I attempted to slow my breathing down. It took all of my strength to force myself to stay seated on the mat instead of wrapping myself around him like a human pretzel and having my way with him without any regret or remorse.</p><p>\"You are meditating?\" Stefan questioned, his voice deep and thick with sleep. \"I will join you.\"</p> <p>\"Uh-uh, Romeo. No naked mediation,\" I whispered, opening my eyes to admire his naked body again. \"Put on some clothes and then you can join me. Otherwise we won't be meditating.\"</p><p>\"Explain why this would be a problem, Josephine,\" Stefan said, his eyebrow arching in humor.</p><p>\"Clothes. Go. Now.\" I commanded and closed my eyes again.</p><p>Stefan muttered under his breath as he stalked away. He was back in less than 30 seconds, loudly clearing his throat to get my attention. I reopened my eyes and he was standing in front of me wearing a pair of tight black boxer briefs. I bit my lip to stop a moan from escaping.</p><p>\"This is better, yes?\"</p><p>He was obviously trying to kill me this morning. His choice of 'clothing' really wasn't much better since the snug boxers left little to the imagination.</p> <p>I could only watch with lustful eyes as he dropped down on the mat to face me and folded his long legs into the half lotus position. His knees were barely touching mine and his eyes slowly closed. He began to inhale and exhale softly, the rhythm of his breathing almost hypnotic. My lids lowered again, instinctively slowing my breath to match his. The energy passing between us was charged and overwhelming in its power.</p><p>I'd just started to relax again when I heard Stefan's voice enter my mind, soft and heavily accented. \"You are sexy when you meditate. Watching your breasts tighten against your top is making me want to fuck you.\"</p><p>My eyes flew open in surprise at hearing his mental voice. I swallowed the lump in my throat as an irresistibly devastating smile broke over his face. \"Ah, you heard me Josephine. Talk to me. Not with your sexy mouth but with your beautiful mind.\"</p><p>I felt by brow furrow as I concentrated on opening my mind to him and decided to tease him about his choice of clothing. \"You and your fuckhot boxer briefs. Are you trying to kill me today?\"</p><p>I heard his audible chuckle, then his quiet, lilting voice entered my mind again. \"No, Josephine. I only want to fuck your beautiful pussy and feel your hot little mouth on my body.\"</p><p>The humor and sexiness was even present in his mental voice. Our eyes locked and his blue eyes were piercing as they stared into mine, filled with a mixture of longing and satisfaction. He obviously was trying to kill me with extreme sexiness this morning.</p><p>\"Your mental voice has a heavy accent. Did you know that?\" I shoved the thought to him again. I was starting to sweat, not only with the effort it took to communicate telepathically, but from his mental sexy talk. It was causing ripples of warmth to spread through me, the heat deepening to linger between my legs.</p><p>He laughed in earnest, deep and melodic. \"Obviously my 'dirty talk' is not working if you are focusing on my accent, Josephine.\"</p> <p>\"Oh, it's working. I'm simply trying to concentrate,\" I retorted playfully, halfheartedly swatting his leg with my hand. \"Now I can hear your sexy voice in my head and with my ears. It's not easy to do, trust me.\"</p><p>Stefan hesitated, obviously choosing his next words carefully. \"I told you this would be an asset if we could learn to talk to each other in this manner. With work, it will be effortless.\"</p><p>\"I know what you said. It's going to take time to get used to hearing someone talk in my head. That's not something that happens every day,\" I replied pointedly, raising an eyebrow playfully. \"Kind of like running into a vampire on the beach.\"</p><p>Stretching lazily, I languidly stood up. \"I'm getting in the shower. You keep working on finding your center, Romeo.\"</p><p>Heading quickly into the bathroom, I turned on the taps and adjusted the water temperature. I undressed and quickly stepped under the hot spray, closing the shower door behind me. I was just reaching for the shampoo when I heard the door open behind me.</p><p>Stefan moved to step underneath the water beside of me. It was impossible for me to move my eyes away from his naked body as the water streamed over his lean, muscular form. I wasn't a religious person but I could have sworn I heard angels singing as his hand reached for the bar of soap, slowly rubbing it over his long arms and sculpted chest.</p><p>I'd never been so envious of a bar of soap until now.</p><p>He lathered the soap in his hands and I stood in reverent silence as he ran his soapy hands down his body, stopping to stroke his generous cock with his soapy hands. He looked up at me mischievously, his eyes like black fire. One side of his lip turned up in a crooked smile as I continued to watch him in awed silence.</p><p>Jerking back to reality, my hands fumbled with the shampoo bottle. I tried to focus on opening the lid, my shaking fingers betraying my outward display of calm.</p><p>\"Allow me.\" Stefan took the bottle from my fingers, squeezing shampoo in his hand. He motioned for me to turn around and he began gently massaging my scalp with his strong fingers.</p><p>My shoulders relaxed as I enjoyed the sensation of the hot water hitting my breasts, the tenderness of his hands in my hair and the feeling of his cool, wet skin pressing against my back. He turned me around slowly to rinse the shampoo out of my hair, his hands going to the bar of soap again. He lathered his hands with it and replaced the bar, looking at my wet skin critically with deeply hooded eyes.</p><p>\"You are dirty, Josephine. Let me clean you.\" Stefan leaned to croon into my ear. His soapy hands began to run over my body tenderly and sensuously, his fingers running over my breasts, down the planes of my stomach to brush between my legs. He finally knelt to move his hands down one leg and up the other one. His eyes were glowing as they roamed over my wet skin, his talented fingers lingering to tease my clit, his hand slowly slipping in between my wet folds.</p><p>I reached out with both hands to press against each side of the shower wall, bracing myself as his fingers teased and moved eagerly inside of me. Stefan placed my legs over his broad shoulders and lifted me up the shower wall, leaving me spread open and completely at his mercy. He proceeded to bury his face in my wet center, flicking his tongue lightly over my swollen clit. I felt my breath catch and my head fell back against the cold tile.</p><p>\"Stefan, it's almost too much.\" My hips unconsciously bucked against his face as his mouth continued to tease me. He moaned against my pussy and the vibration caused me press down harder against his face.</p><p>He stopped and looked up at me, a devilish smile on his lips. \"Do you want me to stop?\"</p><p>\"No! Don't stop.\"</p><p>He buried his tongue inside of me and I writhed against him. I looked down and my arousal intensified at seeing his eyes intent on my face, dark and lustful. He began to gently tease my clit with his fingers, sending more waves of pleasure rushing through me as I cried out in ecstasy.</p><p>My response encouraged Stefan to replace his tongue with his long fingers. I gasped when he sucked my clit into his mouth and his fingers curled against my inner walls. I felt myself contract rhythmically against him and my juices ran down his hand.</p><p>Stefan flattened his tongue and licked me a final time. He lovingly kissed the inside of each thigh gently before slowly lowering my legs to the shower floor and rising to his feet. His hands grabbed my waist, roughly pulling me against him and he slipped us under the shower spray.</p><p>\"Much better.\" His hand cupped the circle of my left breast as he lowered his mouth to let his tongue gently caress my nipple before sinking his fangs into my soft flesh. His cock twitched against my stomach as he drank from me, a guttural growl vibrating his chest.</p><p>He withdrew his fangs from my breast and he pushed me back against the shower wall again, the expression on his face wild and primal. He quickly spread my legs and lifted me, plunging his cock into my wet pussy relentlessly. I clung to him, crying out in response to each of his powerful thrusts.</p><p>\"Do you like it when I fuck you like this, Josephine?\" His mental voice questioned as he slid his cock deeper inside of me, his wet body slipping against mine like satin-covered steel.</p><p>I opened my mouth to talk but his lips covered mine hungrily, silencing me. His tongue pressed into my mouth and I could taste myself on his lips, salty and coppery. Desire surged through me as my tongue battled against his for dominance, the kiss almost violent in its fierceness.</p><p>\"Answer me with your mind, vackra. I want to know if you like how I fuck your tight little pussy. Tell me.\" He continued to slide deep inside of me, my hips rolling to meet each thrust, his mental dirty talk my undoing.</p><p>I knew I wasn't going to last much longer. \"Oh god, yes. Fuck, Stefan!\"</p><p>Without thinking, my teeth sunk into the skin over Stefan's collarbone. His blood rushed into my mouth, thick and tasting like bittersweet chocolate. My bite caused his speed to increase and I felt myself clenching around his cock, my body trembling against him as I shuddered to orgasm.</p><p>His blond head fell back and a roar escaped from his mouth as he came, pulsing deep inside of me. The hot water was barely warm as he carried me out of the shower, my spent body wrapped limply around his.</p><p>He placed me on the edge of the vanity, rubbing a soft towel over me. When he was satisfied I was dry, he began rubbing it over himself. My eyes traced over the contours of his body, watching the muscles ripple with his quick movements.</p><p>He moved to stand between my legs, his mouth curving upward tenderly. He lowered his face to nuzzle his nose against my cheek, his lips showering kisses over my face until he finally reached my mouth. His strong hands moved to cradle each side of my face, reverently kissing my lips.</p><p>\"Josephine, I am eternally yours.\" His mental voice was quiet, sincere and heavy with emotion.</p><p>I wrapped my arms around his neck tightly, pressing myself against him. Fat tears slid down my cheeks before I realized I'd even shed them. I struggled to find the right words to express how I felt, but there was nothing that could describe the combination of love, desire and happiness he managed to make me finally feel.</p><p>\"I, I...\" The words choked in my throat, my voice refusing to cooperate. I was frustrated why I found it so difficult to express to him the multitude of emotions I was feeling. My tears increased as I struggled with my stubborn mind, trying to get it to cooperate with my aching heart.</p><p>His strong arms moved to tighten around me and my heart thumped against the coolness of his solid chest. His entire being was practically humming with happiness as I pressed my lips against his neck.</p><p>\"You will say it when you are ready, Josephine. I love you, vackra.\"</p><p>The days passed by in a blur for us as we wrapped ourselves in a bubble of contentment and solitude. The rainy season had rolled into Canggu, so we were either confined to the villa or forced to go out in the torrential downpour, which neither of us had any desire to do. We spent the time blissfully alone, making love and talking late into the night. Stefan told me what little he could recall from his human life in Sweden and enthralled me with tales from his long vampire life as he traveled from country to country.</p><p>I let myself begin to open up to Stefan and shared my own stories with him. I told him about my ongoing search to find my birth parents, my substantial trust fund and even shared my numerous insecurities with him. We both began to relax and enjoy the unconventional relationship we were starting to carve out for ourselves. Our days and nights were Lukas, Georgia and Anna-free for the moment and when we weren't in bed, we were sprawled on the couch, content in just being together. It was just us. No alarm clocks, no nosy friends and to quote Stefan, no \"vampire bullshit.\"</p><p>To describe it in a few words, it was heaven.</p><p>On the morning of the fifth day, I was greeted with warm sunshine streaming in through the window. I groggily glanced at the bedside clock. 11:25am. Lazily, I stretched and rolled over to Stefan's side of the bed and was surprised to find it empty.</p><p>\"Stefan?\" I sat up in bed and waited for him to answer or for him to come into the room. I tilted my head to the side, listening and trying to ignore the pounding of my heart.</p><p>Something wasn't right, I could feel it in my bones.</p><p>The house was eerily silent. I glanced at Stefan's pillow, expecting to see his standard note. The pillow was empty, still slightly indented from the weight of his head. My breathing increased as I swallowed back the fear that began twisting my stomach in knots. I gave myself a mental pep talk, telling myself that there had to be a note somewhere. I just needed to find it.</p><p>Rolling out of bed, I grabbed my robe that Stefan had tossed on the chaise lounge the previous night. I paused when I noticed that Stefan's duffel bag was missing from the chair. My heart dropped as I tied the belt around my waist tightly and made my way into the kitchen.</p><p>My eyes scanned the counter top for a note. Again, I came up empty. I picked up my cell phone and checked for a message. I swallowed back the lump in my throat when I realized I had no missed calls or messages.</p><p>Wanting to keep myself occupied, I went back to the kitchen and busied myself with making coffee. I tapped my nails impatiently on the counter while I waited for the coffee to brew. I methodically reached for my coffee mug, scooping sugar into it and then poured the steaming coffee in the mug.</p><p>Taking a tiny sip, I padded quietly back into the living room to sit back down on the couch and tucked my legs underneath me. I absently reached to move a pillow and noticed one of Stefan's t-shirts peeking out from behind it. Clutching the material in my hands, I fought the urge to hug against my chest.</p><p>I was unsuccessfully trying to convince myself that I was overreacting. I knew I needed to take it down a notch before I let paranoia completely take over my already panicked mind.</p><p>Three cups of coffee later and the clock nearing four o'clock, there was still no sign of Stefan. I picked up my phone again, this time dialing his cell number. My hands began to tremble when it switched to voice mail after a single ring.</p><p>\"You have reached Stefan Lifsten. Leave a message after the tone.\"</p><p>\"Stefan, it's Josie. I'm wondering where you are. Call me back.\" I quickly pressed 'end' on the phone. My voice sounded much calmer than I felt inside. I couldn't lose the nagging feeling that something was wrong. This wasn't like Stefan. He was like an open book, sharing anything and everything with me. His silence and disappearing act were out of character for him.</p><p>My hands ran through my hair and tried to focus on seeing anything in the future, knowing it was futile at best. I couldn't see vampires. I barked out a bitter laugh at the irony of the situation. The one time I wanted to see a vision, I could see nothing at all.</p><p>I was ready to toss the phone on the couch beside of me when it rang, causing my heart to jump in anticipation. My mind flickered and I didn't need to look at the phone to know who was calling me. It was Georgia.</p><p>Holding the phone in my hand, I considered ignoring her. If I didn't answer, she'd just keep calling. Gritting my teeth, I answered the phone.</p><p>\"Hello?\" I mumbled flatly. I wasn't in the mood for small talk or to hear a lecture from her on how to handle men.</p><p>\"Well hello, sunshine. Who pissed in your Wheaties?\" Georgia asked, her voice sounding concerned.</p><p>\"No one did, Georgia. I'm just in a crappy mood. Am I allowed to be in a crappy mood?\"</p><p>There was silence on the line for a moment. \"Hunky's not around, huh? Want some company?\"</p><p>\"Yes, I mean no. Georgia, I don't know what I want right now,\" I whined, cringing at hearing Stefan referred to as 'Hunky' or even being mentioned. I hated that I was whining about anything, let alone over a man.</p><p>\"I'm coming over.\" Georgia hung up before I could respond. My eyes closed and I felt tears fill my eyes. Preparing myself for her arrival, I inhaled a shaky breath. I didn't want to cry in front of Georgia. I refused to let myself to break down in front of her.</p><p>A few minutes later I heard the door open and my mind was immediately flooded with Georgia's emotions. She was hesitant, angry and worried. I quickly slammed my shield down so I didn't have to deal with her emotions on top of my own.</p><p>Glancing down at my hands, I noticed I was still clutching Stefan's t-shirt. I quickly shoved it behind the pillow beside of me and hoped that her observant eyes hadn't zeroed in on it.</p><p>\"Hun, what's going on?\" Georgia walked over to sit down on the couch next to me, putting her hand on my knee. I raised my head to look at Georgia with tired eyes, not trusting myself to speak.</p><p>I wasn't sure I could do this right now.</p><p>We sat in silence for a long time, neither of us saying a word. Georgia said nothing, only occasionally reaching over to rub my knee or pat my arm sympathetically. I glanced at the time on my phone again. It was almost six o'clock. I wondered if this day was ever going to end, or if it was going to be a never-ending nightmare of waiting for the phone to ring or for him to return.</p><p>\"You gotta tell me something, Josie. Did you and Stefan have a fight?\" Georgia asked. She rubbed my arm softly, sighing heavily. She was obviously at a loss as to what to do or say and I wasn't giving her much to work with.</p><p>Shaking my head, my voice sounded monotone when I spoke. \"A fight,\" I snorted, running my fingers through my tangled hair for what had to be the 50th time of the day. \"No, I don't know what the hell is going on, Georgia. Normally if he goes somewhere, he leaves me a note. There's no note. He's gone,\" I paused for a moment as the realization of my own words sunk in. My voice cracked when I was finally able to speak again. \"He's gone.\"</p><p>\"Honey, he could be at the store. Or home. Maybe he's running errands or doing something besides being up your ass.\" Georgia waved her hand in dismissal. \"Men are a dime a dozen. There's a hundred of him out there, Josie. You shouldn't be tied down anyway. You're young and...\"</p><p>\"I don't want a hundred other men,\" I snapped, my eyes stinging with tears. \"I want him. I finally find him and now he's gone.\"</p><p>\"Holy fucking hell. You love him?\" Georgia asked, her voice incredulous and raising in volume. \"You love him?! Josie, what the fuck?\"</p><p>I went silent again. He'd left me, just like everyone else. I should have known it would happen. I shouldn't have trusted my foolish heart that he wouldn't leave me. My head fell back against the back of the couch, feeling weariness and the bitterness of betrayal wash over me.</p><p>Georgia finally rose to her feet and disappeared into the kitchen. I vaguely heard her talking on her phone to someone, her voice was barely above a whisper. She was probably tired of the silent treatment I was dishing out. To be honest, I really didn't care if I talked to anyone again. I closed my eyes and my mind went numb, losing track of reality and time.</p><p>Hearing a knock on the door, I jumped to my feet and nearly ripped the door off its hinges in my haste to open it. I was expecting to see Stefan on the other side of the door and I felt my face break into a smile. It quickly faded when I saw it was Anna on the porch, her face pensive as she stared back at me. I simply turned around and left Anna standing in the doorway to flop back down on the couch, cradling my head in my hands.</p><p>Their conversation as it went on around me and I made no effort to contribute. I sat sullenly on the couch in my bathrobe, my insides feeling like they were being tortuously ripped apart.</p><p>\"How long has she been like this?\" I heard Anna ask in a hushed tone.</p><p>\"Hours. She won't tell me anything except she thinks he's gone,\" Georgia answered, her voice quiet.</p><p>\"He left her? Without saying goodbye? I don't believe it. I saw the way he looked at her,\" Anna paused for a moment. \"There has to be an explanation Lukas said-\"</p><p>I'd finally heard enough of their speculating and whispering. \"He fucking left me. What's so fucking hard to understand? Everyone leaves me eventually,\" I yelled out in a harsh shriek. I took a deep breath, my voice breaking miserably. \"I know you're trying to help but what I really need is to be alone. Please.\"</p><p>Georgia and Anna looked at each other, their eyes wide and confused. This was a side of me that they'd never seen, the desperately scared woman that feared being left behind. Neither knew what to do or say.</p><p>\"Please. I need to be alone. I just need quiet,\" I begged hoarsely.</p><p>They both tried to hug me goodbye but I'd pulled my knees up on the couch to rest under my chin, refusing to let them touch me. I waited until I heard the door close before I reached to pull Stefan's t-shirt from behind the pillow and hugged it against my chest. I curled into a ball on the couch with my face pressed into the soft fabric, the smell of him on the shirt pushing me over the edge I'd teetered on all day.</p><p>I sobbed into the shirt, soaking it with my tears. I berated myself as I cried, angry that I'd let him in and furious that I hadn't had the nerve to tell him how I felt. I'd turned into the person I said I'd never be, the pathetic woman that cried over a man. Inhaling a shaky breath, I closed my eyes against the flood of tears that were spilling from my eyes.</p><p>It was at that precise moment that I realized how much I loved him and I'd let him slip through my fingers without ever telling him. I'd been too scared and I had to live with my regret now.</p><p>The hours dragged by and I eventually cried myself out, my eyes swollen and my mouth was dry. I staggered to the bathroom, still clutching his shirt. I grabbed a sleeping pill from the bottle in the medicine cabinet and swallowed it with a handful of water from the sink.</p><p>Stumbling into the bedroom, I collapsed in a heap on the bed. I'd assumed I was too exhausted to cry again until I found myself laying on the pillow Stefan had slept on. It smelled like him; sandalwood, the salty ocean and something that was just uniquely him. Tears choked me and sobs shook my shoulders. Crying was the last thing I remembered doing until I fell into a dreamless sleep, my fingers still holding on to his shirt.</p><p>Blinking against the sun streaming across the bed the next morning, my eyes were swollen and puffy from a night's worth of crying. I was considering staying in bed with the covers over my head for the day. I'd clung to the dwindling hope that he'd contact me but he'd disappeared as if he was a figment of my imagination.</p><p>I finally forced myself to get up out of the bed and quickly stripped the sheets from the bed. Walking to the small washer in the utility closet between the bathroom and the kitchen, I shoved the sheets into the washer. I added detergent and started the machine, slamming the door closed on the washer. I couldn't endure smelling him in my bed anymore. The best thing I could do was to wipe him from my memory, as if he didn't exist.</p><p>Just the thought of him not existing was like a knife twisting in my heart. I just didn't want to feel anymore, it simply hurt too much.</p><p>I went into the bathroom, untying the robe and letting it drop to the floor. I turned on the shower, adjusting the temperature and almost sobbed when the memory of him being in the shower with me flashed through my mind. I could almost feel his hands on my skin, his mouth on my lips and breasts.</p><p>I felt a tear escape and run down my cheek as I stepped into the shower and began washing myself automatically and as quickly as possible. I didn't want to spend any more time in the shower than necessary. The memories of being pressed against the wall and the way he felt inside of me was too strong and too powerful to think about right now.</p><p>Turning off the water, I rubbed the towel over my skin and I walked naked into the bedroom. I went to the closet, pulling on jeans and a blue fitted t-shirt over my head. Grabbing a large duffel bag, I started throwing a few changes of clothes inside. I zipped it partially closed, picking it up and heading to the living room. I unplugged my cell phone charger from the wall, tucking it inside the bag. I had my phone in my hand, dialing Anna's number.</p><p>She answered on the second ring. \"Josie?\"</p><p>\"Anna, I need somewhere to stay. Can I stay with you? I can't be here. It's too hard.\"</p><p>\"Absolutely. Do you need me to pick you up?\" Anna asked quietly.</p><p>\"Yeah. Don't tell Georgia. Please.\"</p><p>\"I'll be right there,\" Anna replied and I hung up the phone, shoving it into my pocket. Before gathering my things, I put the bedding into the dryer and walked back to grab my bag and my purse. With a heavy sigh, I took one last glance around the room and closed the door behind me.</p><p>I sat down on the step to wait for Anna and lowered my shields to see her reaction. She was going to try to convince me that I'd be back to normal in no time.</p><p>What if trying to be normal wasn't what I wanted anymore? I'd had a taste of stepping outside my comfort zone with Stefan and now going back to pretending didn't have any allure for me.</p><p>My eyes were downcast as I heard Anna's car pull up. I was at the passenger side of the car before she had completely stopped, yanking the door open and plopping down inside the car and hugging my bag against my chest.</p><p>\"Sweetie, are you ok?\" Anna bit her lip as she looked at me, her brown eyes worried.</p><p>\"No. But I will be,\" I said quietly, my eyes focused on the dashboard in front me. I couldn't look at Anna. I didn't want her to see how weak I was, to see the pain that was probably etched on my face.</p><p>\"Let's get you to my house and get some food and maybe a drink or two in you. You'll feel better in no time.\" Anna was trying her best to sound optimistic although she was failing miserably.</p><p>\"Sounds great. I'll be better in no time.\" My voice sounded hollow, even to myself.</p><p>If I kept lying, maybe I'd start to believe it. I was silent as Anna drove down the driveway, pulling out onto the main road towards her house. I didn't look back once. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I'd been hiding out in Anna's house for two days and I'd spent most of the time pretending that I felt better than I actually did. I'd given up any real hope that Stefan was going to come back. It had been three days since I last saw him, making me question his existence and my own sanity.</p><p>It was close to midnight and I was tossing and turning in the spare bedroom at her house. Anna was exactly what I'd needed. She only talked if I started the conversation, didn't ask a lot of questions and generally let me keep to myself. She also kept me supplied with a steady supply of wine. Adjusting the covers, I wondered if I could just stay here forever. I wouldn't have to go home and deal with the reality of Stefan not being there.</p><p>I'd finally almost dropped off to sleep when I heard voices outside of the house. The sounds were muffled, although I could tell by the tone that whoever was outside was angry. Pulling the pillow over my head to drown out the sound, I rolled over sleepily and imagined Anna in a heated conversation with a spurned surfer in board shorts. I lowered my shields and tried to see Anna's future, confused when I could see nothing.</p><p>Right now Anna had no future.</p> <p>Forgetting about sleep and growing concerned for her, I strained to make out their conversation. The voices steadily increased in volume and I could tell that they were now in the house. Anna's voice was getting louder and was laced with panic as the voices approached my room.</p><p>The door burst open and a wild-looking Stefan loomed in the doorway with both hands braced on each side of the frame. His eyes anxiously darted around the room until they focused on me, his handsome face lined with anguish.</p><p>I jolted upright and my eyes frantically shifted from Stefan to Anna. She was nervously wringing her hands, giving me an apologetic smile as she left the room and disappeared down the hallway. The room was silent with the exception of my pounding heart and the sound of Stefan's ragged breath.</p><p>Gasping weakly, I pulled the covers closer to my chest. I looked back to Stefan, taking in his tousled golden hair and weary face. I couldn't stop the feeling of gratification that rushed through me to see the obvious torment he was feeling. His shoulders were tight and his clothes were wrinkled and disheveled.</p><p>I focused my attention on the covers. I didn't want to look at him. Every fiber of my being ached for him and I didn't trust myself to not give in to him. It would have been so simple to reach out to him and sink into the comfort of his embrace again. But I couldn't do that. He'd left me and I couldn't let my heart get broken again. I sat staring at my hands as they fiddled with the blanket, willing myself to hold it together until I could get him to leave.</p> <p>\"Josephine?\" Stefan whispered brokenly into the darkness. He crossed the room, dropping to his knees at the side of the bed as if in prayer. \"Josephine.\"</p><p>His large hands stretched across the bed, reaching for me. I hastily yanked my hands to my chest, as if his touch would burn me.</p><p>\"You left me. You fucking left me,\" I seethed, feeling my face twist into a grimace. \"I told you everything and you left me! No note, no calls. Nothing! You.left.me.\"</p><p>\"Josephine-\" Stefan was crestfallen, running a hand through his messy blond hair. He reached his hand out to me again. It was tempting to touch him, instead I twisted my hands deeper in the sheets.</p><p>\"Fucking leave, Stefan. I don't want to see you again,\" I muttered, slowly inching further away from him on the bed.</p><p>\"You do not understand. I left-\"</p> <p>\"Oh, I understand completely, Stefan. You left me and now you're back like everything is going to be like it was before,\" I snorted, shaking my head in disbelief. \"Leave before I have Anna call the police.\"</p><p>I turned over in the bed with my back to him. I couldn't handle looking at him anymore. It was killing me inside for him to be so close and not touch him. The lilting sound of his voice had made my stomach flutter and was cracking my firm resolve.</p><p>I couldn't give in. It became my mantra.</p><p>\"I love you. Josephine, please...\" Stefan tried again, his voice cracking into a tortured sob.</p><p>\"Save it for someone that cares,\" I spat at him over my shoulder. \"Just fucking leave.\"</p><p>The tension in the room grew heavier as I heard Stefan stand and cross the room and hesitate briefly in the doorway. I was tempted to look over my shoulder when I heard the door to my room close softly. I held my breath as I heard his car start and pull away from Anna's house, the tires squealing in his rush to leave.</p><p>The house was silent again and I let myself fall apart, sobbing into my pillow. I wanted to run after him and tell him not to leave, that I loved him and that I wanted him to stay. I knew it was too late to beg, although my pathetic mind and heart didn't care.</p><p>They wanted him too.</p> <p>Waving, I watched as Anna's car disappeared down the driveway.</p><p>I'd stayed at her house for another day in seclusion when I finally realized I couldn't hide away in her house forever, even as tempting as the thought sounded.</p><p>I had to resume something that resembled a life and deal with the fallout with Stefan. He'd come back and I'd told him to stay out of my life. I couldn't risk letting him back in to hurt me again.</p><p>Standing alone in my driveway, my eyes glazed over as I remembered my conversation with Anna the morning after Stefan had barged into her house.</p><p>\"Look Josie, I don't know what you're doing but I do know that man loves you,\" Anna said, her eyes sharp and probing. She tapped her fingernails against the wooden table. \"I don't get in your personal life often and you know it. You're making a big mistake. Huge.\"</p><p>I grimaced at her words. \"I'm not going to be with someone that disappears for days with no explanation and then just walks back in, thinking I'm going to just be okay with that, Anna. Would you be okay with that?\"</p><p>Her mouth twisted into a cynical smile. \"No, but let's not turn this into what I'd do and wouldn't do. Your situation is different. He told me he had no choice. You should at least let him explain.\"</p><p>\"Are you new here? I don't want to hear it,\" I argued. \"He chose to leave with no explanations. No phone calls, no note. Nothing, Anna. Maybe he had a fling with someone else and then felt guilty. I don't fucking know and I really don't want to find out. I'm not going through this over and over. A relationship with him isn't worth going through this. I don't do drama.\"</p><p>Anna sipped her coffee silently. She nodded and reached over to pat my hand.</p><p>\"I know you're hurting. Stefan is hurting too. You know and I know you can't avoid this forever. You love each other.\" Her smile was gentle. \"Don't let go of someone you love because you've decided to be a stubborn bitch.\"</p><p>\"I think we're done here, Anna. Don't you have to go to work?\"</p><p>I drew in a deep breath as I snapped back to reality. Maybe it was time for me to move on from Bali and make a fresh start. How could I even think about starting over when I'm still in love with an immortal vampire?</p><p>Squaring my shoulders, I walked slowly up the steps to unlock the door to my house. I opened the door hesitantly, walking in and closing the door quietly behind me. I pressed my back against the smooth wood and felt tears sting my eyes. This was going to be the hardest part. I was going to see the ghost of Stefan in every corner and see a memory of him in every room. I bit my lip, wondering how I was going to find the strength to do this.</p><p>Dropping my bags by the couch, I forced myself to do menial tasks to keep my mind occupied. I ran the vacuum, dusted and scrubbed the counter tops. I went to the dryer to grab the clean sheets, making quick work of smoothing them over my bed.</p><p>I was pulling up the comforter when I noticed a sliver of something white under the table by the bed. It was the corner of a piece of paper and was barely visible unless you really concentrated on looking at it. I bent over to pick it up and my hands shook when I saw the familiar, elegant handwriting on the paper.</p><p>Josephine-</p><p>I know I should wake you, however you are sleeping so beautifully that I cannot bear to disturb you. I must fly to New York to deal with emergency Council business. I will be back as soon as possible. I promise to explain everything in detail when I return.</p><p>Eternally yours,</p><p>Stefan</p><p>The note slipped from my fingertips and my eyes blankly watched the paper flutter to the floor. For a moment, I was frozen in place and my mind went completely numb. I shook myself and wildly ran the length of the hallway, fumbling with my purse to find my phone. I somehow managed to dial his number with shaking fingers.</p><p>\"You have reached Stefan Lifsten. Leave a message after the tone.\"</p><p>\"Stefan. It's Josie. Please call me. I'm sorry. Please...call...\" I choked into the phone. \"I..I just found your note. I..I didn't know. I'm so stupid. So very fucking stupid.\"</p><p>Pressing 'end', I tossed my phone on the couch. I was angry at myself for not even giving him the chance to explain and assuming the worst.</p><p>All I could do now was wait and hope that Stefan was forgiving of idiotic women.</p><p>I was sitting cross legged on the bed with my laptop propped on a pillow, attempting to work on my latest book without much success. I was typing when I heard the sound of car tires turn onto the gravel of my driveway and watched as headlights flashed across my bedroom wall. Swallowing nervously, I placed my laptop on the floor with shaking hands and listened to the sound of a car engine turning off.</p><p>I hurried down the hallway and opened the front door, swallowing back the sob that threatened to break free when I saw Stefan leaning against his car. His hands were shoved into the front pockets of his jeans and when he turned to face me, our eyes locked. The pain I saw in his eyes drew me to him and for once in my life, I didn't stop to think.</p><p>I forgot about my bare feet as I ran over the sharp gravel to him. I collapsed against him, fisting my hands in the back of his t-shirt and burrowing my head into his broad chest, finally letting go of the sob I'd been holding in. He pulled me roughly to him, our bodies reconnecting and molding together as if we'd never been apart.</p><p>\"Josephine,\" he spoke in a broken whisper, the simple sound of his deep voice causing tears of relief to spill from my eyes.</p><p>\"I'm sorry, Stefan. I didn't know. I didn't find your note. I...\" I mumbled against his chest.</p><p>\"Shh. No more talking right now. We would not want Georgia to come over, would we?\" Stefan whispered mischievously in my ear.</p><p>I laughed weakly, remembering when I was the one telling him not to talk. It seemed like a lifetime ago to me.</p><p>\"I'm sorry. I should have let you explain,\" I whispered, looking up into his blue eyes. \"I love you. I don't want another minute to pass without telling you.\"</p><p>\"As I love you, vackra. It is a misunderstanding. This is the part where I forgive you and we move on. I think I read that is what one does in a situation like this. It was good advice from a cheesy romance novel, yes?\"</p><p>I pulled my head away from him to look into his eyes with disbelief. He was going to just forget all the horrible things I'd said to him and act as if nothing had happened? Why was it so easy for him to love and forgive me?</p><p>Being forgiving of stubborn, idiotic women must be one of his super powers.</p><p>He gazed into my eyes and a wry smile pulled at the corner of his lips. In one fluid movement, he leaned forward and covered my mouth with his own. His lips were hard and hungry against mine, causing a slow burn of desire to curl through me. I moaned softly into his mouth and wrapped my arms tightly around his neck.</p><p>He reluctantly pulled away, pressing his forehead against mine lightly. His voice was soft when he began to speak. \"There is much we need to discuss, Josephine.\"</p><p>\"When did you become the serious, level headed one, Romeo?\"</p><p>My mental response seemed to amuse him. Deep laughter rumbled in his chest as he picked me up and carried me into the villa. He sat down on the couch and cradled me in his arms, my head resting against his shoulder. He lowered his blond head to lightly touch his cool lips against mine in a chaste kiss.</p><p>\"It is not a super power, Josephine. I love you and I want no one else but you. For me, it is simple. There is nothing to forgive, it was a misunderstanding. I should have told you that I was being forced to go instead of leaving you a note. I could have called you to explain.\" He exhaled a slow breath, his eyes narrowing dangerously. \"Fucking vampire bullshit.\"</p><p>\"I could have listened that night at Anna's house. I was so angry and hurt, Stefan. The thing I feared the most happened the morning when I woke up alone and had no idea what happened to you. I thought you left me...\" I said, my voice lowering in distress. The memories of our time apart flashed through my mind and the sense of abandonment I felt was still fresh and was painful to think about. His body tensed and flinched underneath me as he read my thoughts, the link between us resonating with pain.</p><p>\"Let me explain to you what happened the morning I left. You were sleeping and I received a text message from a member of the Administrative Board. One of the Council members was acting carelessly and his behavior was threatening to expose our existence. That is what you would call a 'no-no' for us.\" His voice was bitter and his lips were set in a thin line. \"As an Enforcer, I had to convince Derek it was in his best interest to not continue his actions. We finally reached an agreement.\"</p><p>\"An Enforcer?\" I questioned. What does an Enforcer's job entail? Does he pull their arms off if they don't agree with his way of thinking? I found myself getting aroused thinking of Stefan shirtless and ripping arms off of vampires, the muscles flexing in his arms with his effort.</p><p>\"It does not usually get that severe. It requires persuasion and at times a nudge in the right direction. It helps to be able to see their true intentions.\" Stefan smirked and tapped the side of his temple wryly. \"This is my life, Josephine. Until the night I found you, it was extremely dark. You must understand that at any time I might have to leave again. When the Administrative Board places you in a position you do not get to choose. It is considered to be an honor by most.\"</p><p>I nestled closer against him, pressing my lips against Stefan's neck in a gentle kiss. I ran my nose over his skin and inhaled the musky scent of him. \"I take it you don't feel that way.\"</p><p>\"No. I do not.\" He turned his head to gaze at me, a smile breaking over his face that didn't reach his eyes. \"I briefly considered not coming back to you while I was away. I am selfish and could not stay away from you. You are my fated, Josephine. Your soul pulled me back to you like a moth to a flame.\"</p><p>I felt my eyes go wide as I sat up to straddle his lap, anger building inside of me as I placed my hands on each side of his face. \"Hold on for a second. You considered not coming back?\"</p><p>Stefan sighed and his shoulders sagged. His eyes looked ancient and tired, the usual sparkle gone. \"I love you more than I can possibly explain to you. If I could spare you any pain, I would gladly do it to see you happy. I considered the possibility that you might be happier without me in your life. Yet here I am.\"</p><p>\"I'm happy with you. When you were gone, I felt like part of myself was missing.\" My eyes searched his, smoothing my thumbs over his cheekbones and down the side of his face. \"No more doing what you think is best for me, Stefan. My feelings should at least be considered. If we're going to do this, we have to communicate. And that means me too.\"</p><p>Stefan nodded, his face clouded with uncertainty. My mind was suddenly flooded with a barrage of his thoughts. His mind was focused on the night when I angrily told him to leave, my voice bitter and spiteful. It was difficult to watch myself through his eyes, seeing my face contorted in anger. I shivered when I felt his pain and turmoil as he recalled the memories with crystal clarity. I grimaced at my own words that echoed in his mind, 'Save it for someone who cares. Just fucking leave.'</p><p>I started to move from his lap, stopped only by his iron-like grip on my waist. I was ashamed that he'd come back to explain and I'd pushed him away with my refusal to listen.</p><p>Anna was right when she told me I was a stubborn bitch.</p><p>\"I know now that is not true, Josephine. Do not do this to yourself. Not when there are so many things I would rather do to you right now,\" Stefan murmured, his voice brushing over me like velvet.</p><p>The smooth tenor of his voice, deep and sensual, sent a surge of need throughout my body. His blue eyes caressed my face, giving me a sexy smile that sent my pulse racing. His fingertip traced lightly along my cheekbone. \"I missed this, vackra. Jag har saknat att vara med dig, din j?vla.\"</p><p>\"Your Swedish is sexy, Stefan. Translation please,\" I whispered, my panties flooding with wetness as he spoke to me in his native tongue. Between the Swedish and his sexy talk, I was amazed that I had managed to stay dressed.</p><p>He chuckled and his hand cupped the nape of my neck and brought our faces inches apart. His lips moved against mine as he spoke, his voice a lilting caress. \"I simply said I missed being with you, fucking you. When I call you vackra, it means beautiful. And you are the most beautiful creature I have ever seen in my long life.\"</p><p>I let an out a hoarse cry when his mouth covered mine fiercely, his tongue exploring the recesses of my mouth. We shared long frenzied kisses, our tongues teasing and our teeth nibbling. His grip was tight as his hands held me against him</p><p>\"I thought I had lost you, Josephine. Seeing you that night...\" His mind trailed off as he raised his mouth from mine, looking deeply into my eyes.</p><p>\"But you didn't, Stefan. I'm here, you're here. Now shut up and kiss me.\"</p><p>His lips moved to explore my neck, his tongue tracing down my throat to plant a tantalizing kiss against the crook of my neck. I shivered and reluctantly pulled away from him, scooting back farther back on his legs, making short work of unbuttoning his jeans and pulling the zipper down. I tugged on the denim impatiently.</p><p>\"These have to go, Romeo.\"</p><p>His eyes darkened dangerously as he wordlessly lifted his hips for me. I stood and pulled them down over his long, finely muscled legs and feet, letting them slip from my fingers. Pushing his thighs apart and kneeling between his legs, I watched as Stefan made short work of removing his t-shirt, my eyes raking over his naked torso.</p><p>Licking my lips, I lowered my mouth to lazily circle down his stomach and my hands gently grasped his cock. I paused for a moment to slowly rub my thumb over the liquid that had escaped from the head. I ran my hand over his shaft as my eyes lifted to meet his piercing gaze.</p><p>\"I'm not stopping this time. I want to feel you inside of my mouth, Stefan. I want to taste you.\"</p><p>\"Fuck, Josephine. Jag vill k?nna din mun p? min kuk.\" He let out a groan, his breathing ragged. \"Put your dirty little mouth on my cock.\"</p><p>I slowly slid my mouth over him, feeling his cock jerk slightly from the sensation. I hollowed my cheeks, feeling him hit the back of my throat. I pulled my head back, using my teeth to lightly scrape along the top of his hard shaft. He let out a tortured moan as I twirled my hot tongue over the head, tasting the salty sweet flavor of him on my tongue. I lightly sucked the head into my mouth, moving downward to encase his length in my mouth.</p><p>\"I want to come in your hot mouth, vackra. Knulla!\"</p><p>Spurred by his response, I began moving my lips over his cock in a slow steady rhythm, his hips bucking up to go deeper inside of my mouth. My fingers lightly stroked his balls, gently squeezing them gently in my hand. One of his hands threaded in my hair, moving my head faster over his length. He mumbled under his breath and I hummed against him. A growl rumbled in his chest and his long cock hardened more as I sucked him. Tightening my lips around him, I hummed again. He twitched repeatedly inside of my mouth, spilling down my throat.</p><p>My eyes flashed to his face as I watched him climax. The muscles were standing out in his neck and his mouth was slightly open with his fangs extended. I swallowed all he had to offer greedily, letting my tongue lazily swirl against him as he slumped against the couch.</p><p>Stefan's eyes were heavy with emotion as his large hands reached for me, lifting me from my knees. Straddling his hips, I leaned forward to press kisses against his neck. I shifted back to trace his lips with my finger, his mouth opening slightly in response to my touch. I ran a fingertip over each extended fang, feeling him harden underneath me again. His hands tracing absently down my spine, sending shivers of desire throughout my body.</p><p>I couldn't deny the truth any longer. Our days apart proved that I'd only existed prior to meeting him. His very presence made me feel vital and alive.</p><p>\"I missed you, Stefan. All of you,\" I whispered softly. Just saying those words made me feel vulnerable and exposed.</p><p>\"As I missed you. Enough talking.\" He fisted both hands in my tank top, gathering it up and tearing right down the middle, shoving the fabric over my shoulders. His fingertips roamed intimately over the fullness of my breasts, the coolness of his skin causing my nipples to pebble. It was if he was seeing my body for the first time, his blue eyes were glinting with wonder as they traveled over the expanse of my skin.</p><p>\"Du ?r knulla magnifik, Josephine.\"</p><p>Wetness pooled between my legs, soaking my panties and the moist heat flooded against his cock. His eyes drifted to my hips, straddled over him. His hands repeated the process with my shorts and panties, shoving the torn material away.</p><p>My entire body felt like it was on fire, surging with a delicious aching need for him.</p><p>\"Stefan, fuck me. Please.\" My mental voice pleaded with him.</p><p>\"Ah, vackra. I told you that you never have to beg for me to fuck you. It would be my pleasure.\" His mental voice was smooth as his hand slipped between us, his fingers sliding over my slick folds. \"Still so wet for me.\"</p><p>My back arched and my head tilted back when his fingers rubbed through my wetness, a wanton moan escaping from my lips as he brushed against my swollen clit.</p><p>\"So you do want me to fuck you.\" His mental voice was hard and demanding as he lifted me up by my hips and impaled me on his cock, letting out a guttural moan as I enveloped him completely until our hips fused together. \"I want you to fuck me instead.\"</p><p>Gripping his broad shoulders for support, I tilted my hips and plunged onto his thick cock again and again, my inner walls tightening around him. I ground against him and his hands possessively cupped my ass, moving me over his length. My mouth crashed against his and our tongues met to twist together desperately.</p><p>\"It's never enough, Stefan. I can't get enough of you.\" My mental voice sounded desperate as I continued to move against him.</p><p>One of his hands moved up my back to lace in my hair, pulling my face back so our lips almost touched. His other hand gripped my ass harder, opening me wider as I thrust against him.</p><p>\"Never,\" Stefan agreed, his lips soft as they brushed against mine. \"Aldrig nog av dig.\"</p><p>He bucked his hips against me, sliding even deeper inside. My inner walls clenched around his cock, my orgasm overtaking me, devastating and complete. His mouth lowered to capture my nipple in his lips, his fangs piercing the tender skin. I felt him suck gently, his hips lifting to buck faster inside of me as he drank from my breast. He shuddered against me and pulsed deeply inside of me, his hips finally slowing from their rapid pace.</p><p>I felt his fangs retract from my breast and his voice was soft and filled with honesty as he spoke. \"You are my everything. Without you, I am nothing.\"</p><p>\"Stefan...\" Our mouths met again languidly, our kiss gentle and soft. I sighed happily and settled against his chest, his nearness almost overwhelming me. There was a tangible bond between us, overwhelming and almost electric.</p><p>\"Du ?r min, som jag ?r din. You are mine, as I am yours.\" Stefan's voice was silken, his words wrapping around me like a blanket. \"I love you.\"</p><p>\"I love you too,\" I mumbled against his chest, pressing my lips in a kiss over his silent heart.</p><p>\"Please don't leave me like that again. My heart can't take it.\"</p><p>\"I cannot be without you, Josephine. You are my reason to exist.\" His voice was a gentle whisper in my mind.</p><p>The old me would have run as far away from him as quickly as my legs could carry me. The new me reveled in his words, purring like a contented cat.</p><p>We reluctantly separated. Stefan pulled on his jeans to go to his car, leaving me alone to pick up the remnants of ripped clothing. My ruined clothes went in the garbage without second thought. I grabbed Stefan's discarded t-shirt from the couch, pulling it over my head. It swam on my body, the hem brushing the top of my knees.</p><p>\"It looks much better on you than me,\" Stefan said as his eyes roamed over my figure. \"Of course, I would prefer if chose to wear nothing at all.\"</p><p>\"I'm sure you would.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Are you forgetting that I have a nosy neighbor that has a key to my house? A neighbor that loves to barge in without knocking?\" I asked, my eyebrows raising slightly.</p><p>\"Ah, your friend Georgia. It would be hard to forget her, Josephine. She has a way of getting under a ones skin. You should consider calling a locksmith,\" Stefan replied, shrugging indifferently.</p><p>\"She means well. She just tends to get carried away,\" I assured him, worrying about the ongoing issues between Georgia and Stefan. I had a brief mental picture of them chatting over coffee and snorted. I lowered my shield to scan her future to gauge her reaction to Stefan's return, surprised to see it was black. Was I losing my ability? Why else would futures be much more difficult for me to read, or not see at all? It was something I'd have to think about.</p><p>Stefan lounged casually against the door frame with his duffel bag in his hand and watched my mental musing with a lopsided smile on his face. \"She is your friend. I do not have to like or dislike her, Josephine. Let us stop talking and go to bed. You have on too many clothes.\"</p><p>Feigning seriousness, I grabbed Stefan by one of his belt loops, pulling him against me. \"Come on, let's go to bed. No more funny business tonight. I'm tired and it's getting late.\"</p><p>\"I can assure you that none of my plans for you involve humor,\" he retorted with a trace of laughter in his voice.</p><p>\"I'm worried about your memory problems. First you forget about my inquisitive friend and now you're forgetting about my delicate human body?\" I huffed. \"You are old. Is this something I should be concerned about?\"</p><p>I turned on my heel to walk slowly down the hallway, swaying my hips seductively. I turned my head to glance back at him, giving him a sultry look and blowing him a kiss.</p><p>Stefan let out a deep laugh and blurred quickly to swat me on the ass. I jumped and turned to face him with wide eyes, smacking his chest lightly with my hand.</p><p>\"It's a good thing I have a soft spot for vampires that are tall, blond and old.\" I moved to stand on my tiptoes to playfully kiss the cleft in his chin. \"You're a cradle robber, Romeo.\"</p><p>\"Ah Josephine, you are in rare form. Obviously I have not fucked you enough tonight.\"</p><p>How could one statement from him make me rethink my bed time plans? I had envisioned snuggling into bed with him and wrapping up in the covers together. Now my thoughts included ripping off his jeans and fucking him in the hallway. Or on the floor...</p><p>He scooped me up with one arm, throwing me over his shoulder. He turned his head to lightly bite one of my ass cheeks, his laughter booming loudly as I squealed and struggled against him. He continued down the hallway to enter the bedroom and placed his duffel bag on the chair. He moved to the edge of the bed and dropped me in the middle with a small bounce.</p><p>I licked my lips nervously as I scooted backwards on the bed, watching as he slowly unzipped his jeans and let them fall around his feet. He slithered up the bed to loom over me, forcing my head back against the pillows. His hands grabbed the bottom of the t-shirt, ripping it up the middle to leave me naked again.</p><p>\"I told you that you had on too many clothes, vackra.\" Stefan's mental voice cautioned humorously in my head. He slowly sat back on his knees, his eyes sweeping over me as if he was memorizing every swell and curve on my body.</p><p>\"I told you no funny business, Stefan.\" My mental voice was wavering as I watched his lips turn up into a wicked and sexy smile.</p><p>Stefan let out a deep chuckle at my halfhearted mental warning, his finger tracing intimately across my hips to ghost down my top of my thigh. His touch alone caused every nerve ending in my body to come to life, filling with desire for him.</p><p>\"You tell me one thing and your body tells me another. What if I told you I wasn't finished with you yet?\"</p><p>My gaze dropped from his face and headed straight to his hard cock. I watched with unbridled fascination as his long fingers wrapped around his thick shaft. His biceps and forearms flexed with the exertion, causing my breath to catch in my throat. He continued to stroke himself until I couldn't hold back my tormented moan.</p><p>His movements ceased and he planted a hand next to my head, hovering over me again. His eyes were black fire as he moved his cool, firm body to partially cover me, his cock jerking against my hip as our skin touched.</p><p>Stefan's lips brushed against mine as he spoke. \"Does this seem like funny business to you, Josephine?\"</p><p>I shook my head and he began placing slow demanding kisses against my lips. I returned them, savoring every kiss. His mouth left mine, blazing a path down my neck and over my shoulders, his muscular thigh slipping between my legs. My wet sex pressed hard against him, grinding over and over until his thigh was coated with my juices, groaning at the friction it created. He pulled his leg away, his eyebrow raising in amused contempt.</p><p>\"Ah, we can't have you coming on my leg, Josephine. Do you want me to fuck you now and make your hot pussy come all over me?\"</p><p>My head arched back into the pillow, my teeth clenching as I sent him my mental answer. \"You're killing me with your dirty talk, Stefan. I need you inside of me....\"</p><p>Stefan pressed my thighs apart, gripping his cock again and rubbing it slowly through my wet folds and over my swollen clit. \"You are so wet, Josephine. I am going to enjoy making you scream my name.\"</p><p>His head flew back in ecstasy as he slid his thick cock into my slick heat, causing me to cry out in relief and bliss. I wrapped my legs around his hips as he thrust into my body with wild abandon. He was relentless. His cock rubbed against my inner walls and his hips crashed into mine. Our bodies moved in perfect harmony and I felt myself yield to the power and feel of his body driving into me, moaning aloud wantonly and begging shamelessly for more.</p><p>Stefan moved to hook his elbows in the crook of my knees, groaning in pleasure as his cock went deeper inside of me. My hands gripped his taut ass, urging him to go faster.</p><p>\"I want you to come, vackra. I want you to bite me. I want to feel your teeth.\"</p><p>\"Fuck, Stefan!\" My scream filled the room as the combination of his mental commands and his deep, relentless thrusts pushed me over the edge. His head fell against my shoulder as my orgasm crashed over me relentlessly, my pussy tightly clenching around him. I lifted my mouth to bite into the crook of his neck and let his thick blood fill my mouth.</p><p>\"Ja! Drick mitt blod, min vackra gudinna. Knulla!\"</p><p>Stefan let out a deep growl and he surged against me a final time, emptying inside of me. His body still partially covered me, the back of his fingers caressing my cheeks.</p><p>\"You have blood on your mouth,\" Stefan whispered and leaned to run his tongue over my lips. After he was satisfied the blood was gone, he gently kissed me, his tongue slipping into my mouth one more time like a gentle caress. Our mouths parted and the look of adoration and wonderment on his face was unmistakable.</p><p>With that one look, I never felt more beautiful or more loved. My throat was thick with emotion, a tear escaping from the corner of my eye. Stefan's thumb swept across my cheekbone tenderly, wiping it away.</p><p>\"I love you, Stefan. I never want to go a day without telling you,\" I whispered shakily. My body felt boneless and sated, unable and unwilling to move.</p><p>His sea blue eyes were rimmed with tears as he pulled the sheet over our bodies, gathering me into his arms and gingerly pulled me against his chest. \"As I love you.\"</p><p>I struggled to fight the sleep that was slowly pulling me under, basking in the cool embrace of his arms. Unable to talk, I was able to send a final mental thought to him. \"I think I like your funny business.\"</p><p>His deep rumble of laughter in his chest was the last thing I remember before I succumbed to sleep. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"We're not sticking around for Georgia to show up.\" I murmured against Stefan's neck, my fingers running through his thick golden hair. It was late in the morning and we were still tangled beneath a cocoon of covers. Neither of us wanted to leave the comfort and seclusion of the bed to face the reality of the real world just yet.</p><p>Stefan's hands and fingers had been slowly drifting over my naked skin for the last hour, his touch sensuous and teasing. Our lips and hands had been busy exploring each other, relishing being together again. I was disappointed when a vision of Georgia deciding to 'pop in' for a visit later in the afternoon flashed through my mind.</p><p>\"Tell me why are we talking about Georgia, vackra?\" Stefan's melodic mental voice floated into my head. He flipped to his side and his muscles rolled with the movement. He propped his head in his hand and looked at me curiously.</p><p>Tapping my temple with my finger, I raised my eyebrow in surprise. \"Psychic, remember? Do we need to talk about your memory problems again?\" I asked impishly. My hands drifted from his hair to caress the muscles of his broad chest, skimming down his stomach to reach around to squeeze his taut ass.</p> <p>\"Why can't I keep my hands off you you, Stefan?\"</p><p>Stefan smiled and feather-like lines crinkled around his eyes, his answering laugh sexy and deep. His laughter paused as he leaned to kiss me again, his lips pressing against mine in a searing kiss. One of his large hands slid down my stomach to the swell of my hips. \"We seem to have the same problem. Do not worry about your friend. I can take care of Georgia, Josephine.\"</p><p>I moaned into his mouth, reluctantly pulling away. \"That's what I'm afraid of. Let's not start something now that's going to get interrupted, Romeo. I'm serious.\" I lightly pushed at his chest.</p><p>\"Where is your sense of adventure?\" His mind sulked. \"I can tell you can not be swayed, so I will not waste my time. I will have time to distract you later.\"</p><p>He untangled himself from my body, stretching his tall body seductively as he walked into the bathroom. Listening to the sounds of the shower running, my mind wandered to imagine the water running over his lean, muscular frame. A delicious shiver of desire washed over me and my body begged me to join him. I knew if I stepped into the shower with him, we'd never leave this house.</p> <p>Letting out a frustrated groan and rolling over, I hugged Stefan's pillow against my chest. I replayed his words about 'taking care of Georgia' though my mind. When I focused on Georgia coming over and Stefan intervening, Georgia's future went blank. I was starting to lose track of how many times this had happened lately. I'd never had this problem before. Why were futures disappearing?</p><p>The thought had barely crossed my mind when something clicked. It had to be Stefan! If he was involved with a human, their futures went blank to me, like looking into smoke. Directing my thoughts back on Georgia again, I focused on the fact that now Stefan was convinced that we needed to leave for the day. An image of Georgia knocking on my door and then using her key to enter my house filled my mind. As long as he didn't interfere, her future was clear.</p><p>The sound of the shower turning off pulled me out of my thoughts. Stefan swaggered back into the bedroom, running a towel over his large frame. Water dripped from his darkened blond hair to run in a trickle down his muscular chest.</p><p>\"You seem miles away. What are you thinking about, vackra?\"</p><p>He continued to dry off and my mind went blank as I watched him. I mentally shook myself as I tried to focus on talking and away from my desire to lick the drops of water from his chest.</p><p>\"Lately I've been unable to see Georgia or Anna's futures. It should be a relief, but it's been bugging me.\" I rolled over and stood up, grabbing my robe. I slipped it over my shoulders and tied the belt around my waist, leaning against the door frame. \"When I told you I could see Georgia coming over, as soon as you said you would 'take care of her', her future went blank. I realized that if you intervene with a human, I can't see them. It's like looking into smoke.\"</p> <p>\"This is a good thing?\" Stefan asked, as he tossed the towel into the hamper. Biting my lip and shrugging, I ran my fingers though my hair.</p><p>\"I'm not sure if it's good or bad. I'm just blind when you're in the equation. Remember the night you and Georgia had your little disagreement outside and she was poking you in the chest with her finger? I couldn't see her doing that.\" I said distractedly, my fingernails tapping against the wood frame. \"Georgia is almost too easy to read. I have to work to not see her when she's around.\"</p><p>Stefan went to his duffel bag and pulled on a black t-shirt, the fabric hugging the muscles of his back. He slipped on cargo-style shorts and stood to face me, sliding his hands in the pockets. He turned his eyes to the side as if he was contemplating the implications of the different scenarios.</p><p>\"This has never happened before? Only since we met?\" Stefan questioned, his voice filled with curiosity. His blue eyes were still unfocused, a large hand running through his thick, damp hair.</p><p>I shook my head. \"Never. It's just weird. Why are things changing now? I mean, I can't see your future at all and it's the same with Lukas. My theory is that a vampire's influence clouds my visions.\"</p><p>\"I suppose it is something to think about,\" Stefan said. He went to the bed and bent over to straighten the comforter. \"Now go shower. I have plans for us today.\"</p><p>\"Care to share them with me, Romeo?\" I asked curiously. I was suddenly preoccupied with watching the outline of his broad shoulders through the fabric of his shirt as he continued making the bed. Something as simple as watching him do a mundane chore was like watching poetry in motion. By the time my eyes drifted to the sculpted muscles of his arm, my pulse was racing.</p><p>\"You need to stop eye fucking me, Josephine. I can feel you watching me.\" He turned his head to glance at me over his shoulder, his eyebrows waggling seductively. \"I plan on sharing plenty with you later. Go.\"</p> <p>\"All right! I'm going!\" I huffed. Walking into the bathroom, I exhaled a ragged breath and tried to stomp down the burn deep in my stomach. I made short work of showering, hurriedly washing my hair and body, thinking ruefully for the second time that showers weren't nearly as much fun without him.</p><p>Turning off the taps and grabbing a towel, I wrapped it around myself as I headed back to the bedroom while running a comb through my hair. I was wondering what to wear when I saw my black strapless bikini placed on the bed. Hesitating for a moment, my eyebrows raised slightly as I clutched the towel around me. Seeing my bathing suit made me even more curious as to what he had planned.</p><p>Dropping the towel, I grabbed the bottom of the bikini. I'd pulled on the bottom and was reaching for the top when Stefan came back into the bedroom. His sparkling blue eyes turned serious when they took in my naked breasts, crossing the room to pick up the bikini top in his hand.</p><p>\"Let me help you.\" His fingertips grazed over my nipples as he placed the top over my breasts. I shivered at the coolness of his hands against my skin as he hooked the back closed. \"It is a shame to cover your breasts, vackra. They are beautiful.\"</p><p>My voice was shaky when I finally recovered from his seductive touch and lilting words. \"I think you're biased.\"</p><p>\"Try again. Finish getting dressed. I already packed a bag for you while you showered. The sooner we leave, the sooner I get to fuck you.\" Stefan lowered his head to brush his lips against mine. He turned to leave the room and I was captivated by watching his muscular frame disappear down the hallway.</p><p>One of these days he was going to dirty talk me to death.</p><p>Critically looking at the contents of my closet, I finally settled on a black sundress. I dressed quickly, slipping flip flops on my feet and hurried down the hallway to rejoin Stefan in the living room. He was leaning back on the couch, his long legs stretched out in front of him. His eyes traveled slowly over my body, a devious smile pulling at his lips. He languidly rose from the couch and stretched again, his shirt rising to show the sliver of pale, muscular skin of his stomach. My body instantly reacted to his almost feline-like movements, the burn in my stomach increasing.</p><p>\"Are you ready?\" Stefan asked innocently, winking as he bent over to pick up our bags. I snorted at the double meaning of his question. He knew exactly what he was doing to me and was enjoying every second of my frustration.</p><p>\"Since you won't tell me where we're going, I'm as ready as I'll ever be.\" I pouted, crossing my arms under my chest. I hated surprises.</p><p>He chuckled lightly and opened the front door, stopping to slide a pair of expensive sunglasses on his face. \"You are always so impatient, Josephine. You will find out soon enough. We should leave before Georgia decides to grace us with her presence.\"</p><p>His last statement spurred me into gear. I grabbed my purse and followed Stefan outside, stopping briefly to lock the door behind me. Remembering the vision of Georgia walking through my house made me rethink Stefan's words about a locksmith, or possibly investing in a deadbolt.</p><p>Skipping down the steps, I rejoined him by his car. He opened the door for me, waiting to close it after I'd pulled my legs inside the car. It was a matter of seconds when I felt the driver's side door close and his delicious scent filled the car. He smiled and leaned across to press a kiss on my lips, his hand lightly smoothing against the curve of my cheek.</p><p>He started the engine and we slowly drove down the long driveway to pull out onto the main road, heading towards the Seminyak. My eyes drifted to look out the window, my mind filling with questions. I knew what vampires eat, that much was obvious. However, I knew nothing about how he eats when I'm not around. Does he go around biting people? Wouldn't that draw attention if people woke up with bite marks?</p><p>The sound of his deep laughter brought me out of my inner thoughts. Shooting him a dirty look, I felt my cheeks burning in embarrassment. I should have known he'd be listening to my thoughts.</p><p>\"Ask me your questions, vackra. I will tell you whatever you need to know. You know this,\" Stefan said, reaching his large hand over to intertwine our fingers together.</p><p>I drew in a deep breath of courage. \"How do you...eat? I mean, I get how you eat. I just wonder how you go about doing it. You don't just pick random people and bite them do you?\"</p><p>\"No, I do not pick random people and start biting.\" His sunglass covered face observed me for a moment before focusing back on the road. \"I am nearly 1,000 years old and require very little blood to survive. You are the only one I long to bite.\"</p><p>Shuddering from the sensuality of his words, I was amazed at his ability to take a serious conversation and make it sexy. I ran my hand through my hair as I glanced at him. A grin had spread over his face, exposing his white teeth that glinted in the sunlight.</p><p>Sighing deeply, I sent him my mental thought. \"Sexy talking bastard.\"</p><p>His eyebrow raised slightly, shrugging his broad shoulders brazenly in response. \"You know this about me, yet you still love me. Amazing.\"</p><p>\"What about when I'm not around? You were gone for almost five days. You had to be hungry,\" I retorted, immediately wondering if I really wanted to know the answer to that question.</p><p>\"I forget that there are so many things you do not know. Many of us choose to integrate ourselves into society. We not only walk among you, we work with humans as well. Some of us are lawyers, police officers and some are even elected officials. Quite a few of us work in the medical field. We have established networks that give us access to human blood, Josephine. However, there are vampires that have no issue biting and draining a human to the point of death. Their victims disappear, either being turned or dying and being disposed of.\"</p><p>A cold shiver ran down my spine as I thought of all the missing person stories I'd read in the paper or had seen on TV. I was now wondering how many of those missing people were actually victims of vampires.</p><p>\"Not all vampires are pleasant, Josephine. Most are calculating and cruel. You have only met two of my kind, myself and Lukas. You need to remember that we are the exception, not the rule.\" Stefan glanced over at me again. His expression was serious and his lips were set in a thin line.</p><p>\"Speaking of Lukas...how exactly do you know him? Something was going on between you two the other night at dinner. When you told him to stop, he did it like he had no choice.\"</p><p>Stefan said nothing, his eyes staring out the windshield. His thoughts were heavily guarded and he was obviously deciding how to proceed.</p><p>Deciding not to push him, I chose to look out the window while I waited for his answer. The smell of salt was thicker in the air as we got closer to Seminyak and the beach. He still hadn't answered my question, his long fingers were tapping nervously on the steering wheel.</p><p>He finally slowed to turn into a driveway that led up to a large beach house that made my villa look like a tiny shack in comparison. It was two stories, a mixture of white stucco and dark mahogany timber, the landscape littered with tall spikes of bamboo. I was still gaping at the house when I heard the car door open.</p><p>\"Will you join me, Josephine? Or are you satisfied spending the day in the car?\" Stefan chuckled deeply, offering his hand to help me out of the car. Pensively taking his outstretched hand, I slid out of the car to look at Stefan with confusion.</p><p>\"Where are we?\" I asked softly, my eyes drifting back to look at the impressive house.</p><p>\"This is my house,\" he replied quietly. He led me forward, his hand pressing against my lower back. We walked up the steps onto the front porch and Stefan opened the large door, motioning for me to go in. I cautiously stepped inside, blinking as my eyes adjusted from the sunlight to the much dimmer light of the house.</p><p>The main room was large and the ceilings were high and vaulted. A large, beige couch stretched the expanse of one wall, littered with pillows. At one end, the wall was filled with ceiling to floor windows with an elegant dining room table dramatically placed to take advantage of the landscaping and view outside.</p><p>Wandering down the hall, I entered into the kitchen, which was large and modern with stainless steel counter tops and appliances. The double doors were open and led out to the upper patio, which offered an impressive view of the Indian Ocean. I took a step out on the patio, stopping to rest my hands on the dark wood of the railing and inhaled a deep breath of sea air.</p><p>Glancing down, the level below had another deck that was scattered with sun beds around a large gradual-depth pool. There was a covered area with a large sofas and lounge chairs that surrounded a large fire pit. I could picture myself straddling Stefan on the couch, the sound of the waves crashing and the breeze from the sea brushing over our naked skin. I unconsciously shivered at the vivid image in my mind.</p><p>\"I take it you like it here?\" Stefan's voice startled me, bringing me out of my silent musings. He had been following behind me, watching in silence as I walked from room to room.</p><p>\"Like it? It's unbelievable,\" I murmured in amazement. Stefan walked to stand behind me, leaning over to wrap his long arms around my waist and resting his chin on my shoulder. I leaned back against him, a tiny smile breaking over my lips as he lightly kissed my cheek.</p><p>\"It is just a house. I like it much better now that you are here,\" Stefan's lips murmured against my face. I twisted in his arms to look at him, his arms still wrapped loosely around me. His eyes were covered with sunglasses and the sea breeze lightly ruffled his blond hair. I couldn't resist the urge to run my fingers through the thick golden strands, his silky hair gleaming and warm from the sunlight.</p><p>\"Why is it that we've been staying at my house when we could have been here? This place makes my villa look like a shed,\" I asked curiously. Stefan drew in a deep breath, tilting his head back. His lips parted to speak when a piercing voice cut into the peacefulness of our conversation.</p><p>\"My, my. Look what the cat dragged in. Stefan and Josie! What a wonderful surprise.\"</p><p>Lukas. I suddenly understood why Stefan had chosen to stay at my house.</p><p>\"Does that answer your question, vackra?\" Stefan's mental voice had an exasperated edge to it. \"He is my immortal version of your Georgia.\"</p><p>Swallowing back a giggle at Stefan's internal aggravation, I turned my head to glance at Lukas. He was shirtless with his hands on his hips and was dressed in a pair of ridiculously small red speedos. I quickly buried my head in Stefan's chest, letting out a groan. I could add that to my list of things I never needed to see again.</p><p>\"Lukas, do you not have something else to do?\" Stefan's question sounded more like a command. His voice was intense and his body shifted to stretch to his full height.</p><p>\"Actually, I don't. I thought I'd join you on the beach today. Josie and I can get to know each other. We can people watch and gossip. We'll have so much fun!\" Lukas chirped as he glided down the steps to the pool, smoothly diving in the water. He was like a torpedo, barely rippling the surface of the pool.</p><p>\"Are you going to tell me why Lucas is here?\" I asked, turning my head to look up at Stefan. He still hadn't answered my question about how Lukas fit into his life.</p><p>Stefan let out a long sigh. \"Give me a moment. I need to check on a few things, change, then we will talk.\" He was a blur as he disappeared inside of the house. Plopping down into one of the deck chairs, I closed my eyes and mentally willed Lukas to keep swimming. The last thing I wanted to do was to be subjected to his exaggerated chatter.</p><p>\"I'm so glad you and Stefan made up. He was a pissy little bitch for days. I was ready to kick his ass or stake him to stop his moaning.\" Lukas' voice lisped from the chair beside of me. Surprised from his silent approach, I jumped and drew in a deep breath to try to slow my racing heart.</p><p>\"Damn it Lukas, you scared the crap out of me! Warn a person that you're coming.\"</p><p>Lukas was dripping wet, his ice blue eyes covered with sunglasses. Pursing his lips, he raised his eyebrow in amusement. \"I keep forgetting you startle so easily. Maybe I should clap when I approach. Now hurry up and tell me what happened before he comes back outside and ruins our gossip time.\"</p><p>\"It was a misunderstanding. It happens.\" I tried to keep my voice noncommittal, shrugging my shoulders slightly. I closed my eyes again, hoping he would catch on that I didn't want to talk.</p><p>Relaxing my head against the deck chair, I sent out a mental plea to Stefan. \"What are you doing in there? Hurry up, he has me cornered.\"</p><p>Lukas pursed his lip again and rolled his eyes. \"I couldn't deal with his obsessive worrying and whining. I called up Anna because I had a feeling you'd hide out there. When she told me you were staying at her house, I told him where you were. I thought Mr. Romance would sweep you off your feet and you'd forgive him. I should have known he'd be all over dramatic and blow it.\"</p><p>I couldn't help but laugh at his 'Mr. Romance' comment. Where the hell was Stefan? \"I didn't even let him get a full sentence out, Lukas. I pretty much told him to fuck off. I'm not always reasonable. Or rational.\"</p><p>\"Oh, you two are perfect for each other.\" His face turned soft and dreamy, his eyes glowing behind his sunglasses, clasping his hands together over his heart. \"He's swooning over you like an infatuated teen and you're going to bust his ass at every turn. This will be better than my telenovelas.\"</p><p>I simply stared at him for a moment, thinking to myself that he truly was the gay, male version of Georgia, minus the southern accent.</p><p>\"It looks like fun time is over. Here he comes now,\" Lukas leaned over to whisper conspiratively in my ear, his posture slumping in defeat.</p><p>Stefan stalked back onto the deck in a pair of navy blue board shorts, dipping low to show the harsh V of his lower stomach that disappeared into the waist of his shorts. He was shirtless, the sun making the golden hair on his sculpted chest shine. \"Lukas. I think you have had enough fun for one day. I know you have matters to attend to, yes?\"</p><p>\"You're no fun.\" Lukas pouted as he stood up and pranced into the house, slamming the door behind him.</p><p>Stefan let out a long sigh and flashed me a strained smile. He lowered to crouch in front of me, his hand tucking a lock of my hair behind my ear and his finger moving to caress my face delicately.</p><p>\"I am sorry I was gone so long. I had an e-mail to respond to from the Council,\" Stefan explained as he rose to stand to his full height.</p><p>I was shameless, letting my eyes roam over the lines of his powerful body. The muscles in his chest and arms looked like they were carved from marble, his abdomen toned and his legs were long and lean. My eyes made the trip back up to his face and his words finally registered with me. A flicker of apprehension swept through me. \"You aren't leaving again are you?\"</p><p>\"No. Nothing like that,\" Stefan reassured me, his voice smooth. \"Come. I want to walk on the beach with you. First we need to take off your dress.\"</p><p>Before I could react, he quickly pulled the sundress over my head. His eyes raked over my bikini in approval. \"Much better.\"</p><p>We both heard a tap on the window by the deck. We both looked up to see Lukas staring out the window, giving us the 'thumbs up' sign.</p><p>Georgia and Lukas could be twins if not for their age difference. They were both a pain in the ass.</p><p>\"Can we go? Lukas is driving me crazy.\" My mental voice begged.</p><p>He tugged on my hand, giving me an understanding smile. He led us down the steps onto the main patio area, walking through a gated door that opened onto the beach. The sound of the waves was loud as they crashed against the black sand. We walked to the edge of the water in silence.</p><p>Stefan intertwined our fingers together and he let out a contemplative sigh. His eyes closed for a moment and he drew in an unnecessary breath.</p><p>Glancing at him curiously, I mentally questioned him. \"What's going on? Are you okay?\"</p><p>\"Right now I realize how devastating it would have been to have lost you, Josephine,\" Stefan's voice was thick with emotion. \"The thought of you not being here with me is excruciating.\" He gently squeezed my hand, then pulled on it slightly to urge me to follow as he started walking again.</p><p>\"I don't want to think about that anymore, Stefan. I love you and we're together.\"</p><p>\"I do not want to think about it either. Bringing you here to my house made me realize all of my foolish mistakes,\" Stefan murmured, his face was pensive and distant as if lost in a memory.</p><p>We walked along in silence for a few minutes, the warm water rushing up to cover our feet occasionally. As I watched the waves swell, my mind began to wander. Why was he refusing to answer any questions about Lukas?</p><p>\"You never answered me when I asked about Lukas earlier. What's going on with you two? And why is he here today?\"</p><p>\"Lukas is my child,\" Stefan answered simply. He glanced down at me briefly, squeezing my hand again.</p><p>I stopped walking as I took in his words. He stopped and turned slightly to face me. \"He's your child? You need to explain.\"</p><p>He sighed heavily, his face contemplative as he began to talk. \"Approximately 175 years ago, I was living in the Netherlands. When he was still human, Lukas became a friend to me. He owned a small bookstore that I would visit frequently. He fell ill and was close to death. I chose to turn him instead of letting him die,\" Stefan hesitated, looking down at the sand for a moment. \"You lead a lonely life as a vampire, vackra. He was the only human friend I had and I could not bear to see him die. He accepted this new life with zest. He was amusing and frustrating as a human, now even more so as a vampire. He is like a brother to me.\"</p><p>\"Is that why he listens to you?\" I questioned as we resumed our walk again.</p><p>\"He has no choice in the matter, Josephine. I am his sire. He is compelled to listen.\"</p><p>\"So as his sire he has to listen to you? He has no choice? And what about your sire?\" I asked, my words coming out in a jumbled rush. This was one of those moments where I wished my internal dialogue had to go through some sort of filter before it actually verbalized.</p><p>\"I never know what is going to come out of your beautiful mouth, vackra.\" He laughed dryly. \"Lukas thrives being a vampire and I do not force him to do anything unpleasant. He is a trusted friend, Josephine. As for my sire, she is dead.\"</p><p>\"She's dead? I'm so sorry.\" I felt horrible for even bringing the topic up and grilling him about it.</p><p>\"Do not be sorry, Josephine. I am glad she is dead. She was beautiful but completely insane. She was turning humans into vampires and leaving them to wipe out entire villages. That is also considered a 'no-no' by the Council.\"</p><p>\"I think I need an 'Idiot's Guide to Understanding Vampires' book. Or some kind of cheat sheet.\" I shook my head to try to organize my thoughts. I was quiet for a moment before I asked my next question. \"Stefan, do you want to turn me?\"</p><p>\"What do you want me to say, Josephine?\" His voice was deceptively calm and his body was tense as we continued walking. It was obvious that this was another conversation Stefan did not want to have with me.</p><p>Swallowing hard, I fought to keep my voice steady as I answered him. \"The truth would be nice.\"</p><p>\"Then I will answer you honestly. I want an eternity with you, Josephine. For two centuries I waited to find you. It took me 200 long years to find you and I do not want to let you go,\" Stefan's voice cracked with emotion. \"Vackra, it is your decision. I will never force you to change for me. You will tell me when and what you decide, yes?\"</p><p>I nodded slowly. \"I know that I want to be with you, Stefan. I just can't make that kind of decision right now. My brain is on overload right now.\"</p><p>\"You have time to decide. I am happy just being here with you, Josephine. I love you. The rest is minor details.\" Stefan made a dismissive gesture with his hand. \"We need to turn around and head back.\"</p><p>Our heavy conversation over, we turned around and started the walk back towards his house. A few times Stefan would pick me up, playfully threatening to toss me in the water. I would squeal and try to get away from him in mock fear. Stefan tossed me over his shoulder as we headed up the path to the gate that led to his house. I playfully smacked his tight ass and his shoulders shook with laughter in response to my weak swats.</p><p>\"I am sure you are hungry. Let us go inside.\" He closed the gate behind us, still carrying me upside down across the patio and up the steps to the upper deck.</p><p>\"Stefan, you can put me down. I can walk.\" I smacked his ass again. \"When did you have time to get food?\"</p><p>\"I did not do anything. I sent Lukas out to shop for you. It is one of the many ways I can get back at him for being mercurial.\"</p><p>We walked into the kitchen and he set me down on my feet. I slowly headed to the refrigerator and looked inside. It was filled with different fruits, containers of various meats and bags of cheese.</p><p>\"Did he buy the entire store? I can't eat all of this.\" I motioned irritably to the open refrigerator with one hand.</p><p>He chuckled, raising his eyebrows as he observed the packed refrigerator. \"This is how Lukas thinks, vackra. He is almost like a child and he does everything to the extreme.\"</p><p>Busying myself in the kitchen, I made a sandwich and focused on cutting up fruit to hide my frustration. I sat down at the breakfast bar in the kitchen and started to eat. Stefan leaned against the opposite side of the counter with his chin resting on his hand, contentedly watching me as I ate.</p><p>The house was quiet as I picked at my food. Stefan stood motionless, his eyes tracing my face. Occasionally he would smile, causing the lines of his face to soften. It was easy for me to see how he managed to blend in with humans. Stefan was able to appear vulnerable and put people at ease with the humanity he was able to maintain.</p><p>\"You make me self-conscious when you watch me like that, especially when I'm eating,\" I said as I popped the last bite of sandwich in my mouth. He walked around the bar to stand in front of me, his finger lightly tracing my lips as I swallowed.</p><p>\"Why? I find your mouth sexy and watching you eat excites me. Leave your plate and come with me, vackra.\"</p><p>He took my hand and led us back down the steps to one of the lounge chairs on the sun deck. I sat down on the edge of the chair, pulling my legs up on the seat. He walked to the edge of the pool and pushed the blue board shorts he was wearing down over his narrow hips. He took wide strides to walk to the deep end of the pool, gracefully diving into the water.</p><p>My mouth went dry as I watched his naked body glide underneath the water effortlessly. His head emerged out of the water and his long fingers combed his wet hair back from his face, looking like every hot-blooded woman's secret fantasy. He crossed his long arms on the side of the pool, resting his chin against them.</p><p>\"Are you going to join me, Josephine? Or are you planning to eye fuck me from your chair all evening?\"</p><p>I stood up slowly and crossed the patio to sit on the edge of the pool beside of him, sliding into the water in one swift movement. When I surfaced he was next to me instantly, wrapping me in the embrace of his arms.</p><p>His fingers worked quickly to unclasp my bikini top, throwing the wet material on the patio. \"Once again you have on too many clothes. This seems to be an ongoing issue, vackra.\"</p><p>My hands went to quickly cover my breasts. \"Stefan! What about Lukas?\"</p><p>\"He is gone for the night. You also have the wrong equipment for Lukas' taste.\"</p><p>Stefan disappeared underneath the surface of the water. His hands moved down my stomach to tug at the bottom of my bikini, pulling it down my legs. His body slid against mine as he came up to the surface again, twirling the bottoms around his index finger and tossing it to join the rest of my suit beside of the pool.</p><p>\"Now, vackra. Where were we?\" Stefan's arms wrapped around me again, pressing my wet body against his. \"Ah yes, I think we were right here.\"</p><p>His lips moved softly over my cheek, his tongue flicking out to lick the outline of my lips. I wrapped my arms around his shoulders, my mouth parting slightly to encourage him to continue. His hand laced in my long, wet hair and pulled my head back slightly to expose my neck to his mouth. His lips and tongue moved down my throat, only to follow the same enticing path back up. Stefan's mouth stopped to hover lightly against mine, one corner of his lip curled up in a smirk.</p><p>\"Why are you stopping?\" My mental voice snapped.</p><p>\"You are always so impatient. I am trying to seduce you.\"</p><p>\"I think we're past the point that you need to seduce me, Romeo,\" I whispered against the softness of his lips.</p><p>\"I will always think of new ways to seduce you, Josephine, as I will always think of new ways and places to fuck you.\" His breath washed over my face, cool and captivating.</p><p>\"Stefan....\" I began, my voice soft and pleading. \"I didn't want to be seduced.\" He already had every part of me: body, heart and soul.</p><p>\"Patience, vackra. I have plans for you.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"What if I have plans for you instead?\" I asked him, raising an arched eyebrow at him. We were pressed close together, the water from the pool doing nothing to cool the overheated state of my arousal.</p><p>\"Then I would tell you to show me your plans, vackra.\" Stefan's mental voice murmured seductively in my mind. His words were like pouring gasoline on the already smoldering fire in the pit of my stomach.</p><p>The small amount of patience I'd possessed disappeared. I wasn't sure if I'd ever get used to the sound of his softly lilting voice, the way his velvet skin felt against my own or the longing I had for his touch. I had no control over my own desire and hunger for him. The overpowering need for him coursed through my veins, insatiable and demanding.</p><p>My hand snaked up to his neck, gripping him fiercely. My lips were desperate as they covered his and my tongue darted into his mouth. His tongue flickered to meet mine lazily, sending spirals of need through my body.</p> <p>His hands were teasing as they drifted up the skin of my back, gently threading in my wet hair. His tongue moved to explore deeper inside of my mouth and his hard cock pressed against my stomach. I moaned against his mouth, my fingers combing through his thick wet hair. I let my hands delicately trail down his neck, my nails sinking into the skin on his broad shoulders. Shifting to lock my legs around his narrow waist, I slightly tilted my hips to lower myself onto his thick cock. My breath caught as he stretched and filled me, losing myself further to the feel of him inside of me, deep and twitching.</p><p>Stefan's body tensed and a deep growl escaped from his lips. His hips bucked against me on their own volition as his large hands gripped my ass. He slowly turned us in the water and walked us out of the pool, our bodies still joined intimately. Water fell from our naked bodies in sheets on the deck.</p><p>He raised his mouth from mine as he gently eased me down on one of the cushioned lounge chairs. His tongue darted out to lick across his lower lip sensuously, his chiseled face dark with desire. Water ran down his chest in tantalizing streams.</p><p>His fingers traced lightly down the length of my legs to grab my ankles, spreading my legs wide. He hooked my knees over his muscular forearms and loomed over me, his large hands pressing into the chair next to my head. His movements were slow and deliberate as his cock slipped deeply inside of my slick pussy, our wet bodies gliding effortlessly against each other.</p><p>\"Why can I not get enough of you?\" His mental voice was ragged, his jaw clenched in a mixture of agony and ecstasy. \"No matter how many times I have you, I only want more.\"</p> <p>The chair creaked in disapproval as he pounded into me. Soft, ragged moans slipped from my mouth as one of my hands tightly gripped his arm as I welcomed his powerful thrusts. My head arched back against the chair and my other hand slid between my thighs to slowly rub my swollen clit, writhing under the feel of my own touch and the sensation of him moving forcefully inside of me.</p><p>Our bodies continued to move in unison, my hips rising to meet his rapid strokes. Our eyes locked and his lips parted slightly in response. His fangs were fully extended and softly glinting in the fading light.</p><p>\"Stefan....\" I cried softly, my fingers pressing against my clit as I continued to pleasure myself, my nipples growing taut and my inner walls tightening around him. Stefan snarled and began to move his hips faster in response to hearing his name fall from my lips.</p><p>He reached down to capture my hand that was busy between my legs and placed my slick fingers inside of his mouth, his tongue wrapping sensuously around each one. His fangs scraped against my skin as he pulled them slowly from his mouth with a violent groan.</p><p>\"Delicious, vackra. You are fucking magnificent.\"</p><p>Stefan sat back on his heels, my trembling legs slipping down the length of his long arms to rest on top of his thighs. His powerful hands gripped my hips as he pulled me roughly against his cock as our bodies met with an explosion of raw passion.</p> <p>\"Don't stop...don't you dare stop...\" I begged for release, slowly coming unraveled underneath him. My body felt as if it was engulfed in flames, desire coursing through me like liquid fire.</p><p>Stefan's hands wrapped around my arms and pulled me upright against his chest. My legs encircled his waist and my heels dug into the cheeks of his ass. His surging hips tilted up as I frantically ground against his thrusting hips. My arms wrapped around his neck and my head fell to the side, exposing my neck to his lips.</p><p>\"Fuck, Stefan. I want to come! I can't stop...\"</p><p>I was ready to shatter around him when his frenzied mental thoughts flooded into my mind. They were jumbled, feral in nature and his response to me turned completely instinctual. My Stefan was lost to me right now, he was simply a vampire focused on the act of fucking and my blood. Moaning in a combination of fear and arousal in response to him, his black eyes darted to mine briefly before his head blurred to my neck. His fangs slipped into the skin of my neck and he slammed his hips against mine mercilessly, a harsh growl vibrating in his chest as fed from me. Feeling my eyes roll back, I let out a strangled scream. My pussy clenched around him and my orgasm caused my body to seize around him uncontrollably.</p><p>He withdrew his fangs from my neck and smiled dangerously. \"We are not finished yet, Josephine.\"</p><p>He turned me around and slipped into me from behind, pressing my back tightly against his chest. Moaning brazenly, I turned my head to place wet kisses against his throat as he continued to plunge up into my boneless body.</p><p>\"Stefan...\" I murmured as he thrust inside of me, his hands roughly caressing my breasts. \"Why do you always feel this good?\"</p><p>He moved faster, a guttural moan rumbling in his chest. My head pressed into his neck, another orgasm charging through me and igniting his own. I shuddered around his cock, screaming and contracting around him wildly as he pulsed inside of me. His roar of completion was deafening as it burst from his chest into the humid air.</p> <p>Trembling, my heart hammered in my chest as I fell back against him. It didn't matter where I went now. Being with him was the home I'd been searching for. I couldn't be without him now.</p><p>\"You are my home, vackra. You own my heart and soul.\"</p><p>The sound of Stefan's mental voice brought me out of my thoughts. He fell back against the chair and shifted to his side, pulling me to lay beside of him. His eyes were clouded with worry as they searched my face.</p><p>\"I love you, Josephine,\" Stefan said, his voice thick. His troubled blue eyes closed slowly and he lowered his forehead to rest against mine. I lightly stroked the side of his face and my fingertips traced the curve of his lips.</p><p>\"I love you.\" I pressed closer against him, our bodies fitting together perfectly as if they were made for one another. \"Stefan, look at me.\"</p><p>He raised his head, his blue eyes boring into mine. \"I am angry at myself, Josephine. I lost control and I could have hurt you. All I could think of was fucking you and your...\"</p><p>\"Blood.\" I finished for him. I ran my fingers across his lower back, brushing against his taut ass. \"I'm not going to lie, Stefan. For a moment I was scared, but I knew even when I'd lost you for a moment that you wouldn't hurt me. You're a vampire and you're going to be focused on blood. I don't think I helped things out by offering my neck to you either...\"</p><p>Stefan froze as my words sank in. He was a blur as he sat up, grabbing my head and turning it to the left to look for the marks from his fangs. He dropped his hand slowly, his face confused and his eyes blank.</p><p>I tried to focus on his thoughts. Unless he was directing them to me or he was distracted, they were similar to watching a movie on fast-forward. They tumbled over each other as he considered a new idea, discarding it to move to the next.</p><p>Quickly sitting up beside of him, a shiver of panic coursed through me. \"Stefan. What's wrong? You need to start talking.\"</p><p>He sat motionless, the air between us growing tight as his mind continued to race.</p><p>\"Stefan, please talk to me.\" I pled with him mentally. A cold knot began to grow in the pit of my stomach. If he was quiet this long, it couldn't be good. I didn't know what was going on but he needed to explain before I really started to panic.</p><p>His cool fingers reached up again to stroke the skin on my neck. His jaw was clenched and his eyes slightly narrowed.</p><p>\"There are no bite marks, Josephine. They are gone.\" Stefan's voice was tense with anxiety, the muscles in his broad shoulders tight.</p><p>\"What do you mean they're gone? You bit me. Believe me, I felt it in a good way,\" I said, my fingers absently moving to run over my own neck. I felt nothing but my smooth skin under my fingertips. It was if he had never bitten me.</p><p>\"Where did they go? Bite marks just don't disappear, right?\"</p><p>Stefan was quiet for a moment, the tense lines on his face deepening. \"No. Bites do not just disappear. I do not have an explanation, only an opinion.\"</p><p>I swallowed roughly. \"What's your opinion?\"</p><p>\"I am going to make the assumption that you healed from the blood you have taken from me. You have bitten me twice. My blood possesses healing properties, Josephine. It could be as simple as that.\"</p><p>Taking a quick inventory of my body, I looked for his fang marks. He had bitten me many times on my breasts and once or twice on my inner thigh. My eyes roamed to both places, looking for any lingering bite marks.</p><p>All of them had disappeared. Every single one was gone.</p><p>My voice didn't sound like my own when I spoke again. \"They're all gone, Stefan. Is this bad?\"</p><p>\"That I do not know. I have only shared my blood with one other human and he is now a vampire,\" Stefan answered thoughtfully, his voice quiet. \"I can call one of my friends on the Council. He may have answers for us.\"</p><p>\"I'm not turning into a vampire am I?\" I questioned softly. I felt my hands twisting nervously in my lap, my eyes wide as they searched his face.</p><p>A brilliant smile broke over his face. He lowered his head to lightly kiss my forehead, my nose and then brushed his lips against mine. \"No. You do not have fangs and you do not want blood. We just require answers. Perhaps contacting my friend would be a good thing. If nothing else it will put both of our minds at ease, yes?\"</p><p>I nodded and my shoulders relaxed in obvious relief.</p><p>\"Let us go inside. I have a bathtub I want to explore with you.\" Stefan winked, standing up and offering me his hand. I took it and he led us up the steps into the house. We walked through the spacious living area, climbing up another staircase that led to the master suite. The bedroom was huge, decorated in neutral colors and faced another wall of windows that overlooked the ocean.</p><p>Pausing to take in the enormous bed that faced the windows, my thoughts were moving at a frantic pace. My shields were changing and bite marks were disappearing from my body within minutes. I felt like I was on the cusp of a major change, I just had no idea what that change was going to be or if I was ready for it. I gave up trying to be normal when I chose to be in a relationship with a vampire, a creature of legends.</p><p>Leave it to me to push the proverbial envelope.</p><p>Hearing water start to run in the adjoining bathroom, I padded across the plush carpet to lean against the doorway of the bathroom, watching him adjust the temperature of the water that was filling a large bathtub. The smell of sandalwood drifted from the steaming water, filling the room with the delicious scent. I unconsciously exhaled a deep sigh of contentment as I breathed in the fragrant air.</p><p>It smelled like Stefan and home.</p><p>\"Ah, there you are, vackra. Come.\" Stefan said, turning to face me. His large hand beckoned for me to join him.</p><p>I quickly moved across the cool, white tile to stand beside of him. He leaned to effortlessly lift me in his arms, stepping into the bathtub and lowering us both into the fragrant water to face each other. The water brushed lightly against the tops of my breasts.</p><p>He twisted slightly to turn off the taps and then turned back around to face me again. His eyes swept over my face intently, a play of emotions running across his handsome face.</p><p>\"You are truly breathtaking, Josephine. There are moments that it seems as if I am seeing you for the first time.\" His hands moved under the water to pull me closer to him, moving my legs to rest lightly on the tops of his thighs. We sat close together, our skin making contact intimately. His hand emerged from the water and he ran his wet fingertips over my hardened nipple.</p><p>\"Stefan....\"</p><p>\"Shh. I want to just be with you right now. I want to hear your heart as it beats. I want to feel your skin against my skin.\" He traced a wet fingertip across my lips and his eyes darkened with emotion. \"You think too much, Josephine. There are times you need to let yourself feel.\"</p><p>His hands moved to wet my hair, reaching for the shampoo to lather my hair. My eyes closed and I concentrated on the feeling of his gentle fingers rubbing my scalp and the quiet sound of his breath, slow and steady as it fanned across my face. Warm water flowed over my head and shampoo suds ran over my shoulders. His hands, slick with soap, ran over the length of my arms and moved to slip around the fullness of my breasts.</p><p>\"You need to stand up, vackra.\" Stefan's mental voice nudged tenderly into my thoughts.</p><p>Pressing my hands against his shoulders, I moved to stand in the bathtub. His soapy hands continued their downward descent, running across my stomach and exploring the wet skin of my hips and thighs. Stefan's hands glided down each of my legs and his hands brushed between my thighs.</p><p>\"Beautiful. Sit down, Josephine.\"</p><p>My heavy-lidded eyes met his, my pulse quickening from his touch. I could see the emotion burning in his eyes as he watched me sit back down to face him, the warmth from the water rushing against the heat of my flushed skin.</p><p>He leaned to kiss me and his lips were gentle and searching. My hand moved to cup the back of his neck, pulling his head closer to deepen the kiss. He teasingly pulled his lips away and his eyes glittered devilishly.</p><p>\"Just feel, vackra.\" His mental voice was a seductive whisper. \"Now wash me.\"</p><p>Swallowing nervously, I bit my lip. I washed his hair, using my hands to spread the shampoo through his thick, silky blond hair. I used my nails to lightly scratch along his scalp and let my fingertips lightly graze against the back of his neck. His chest rumbled slightly in pleasure, his eyes closing and his long eyelashes casting light shadows on his cheeks.</p><p>I lathered my shaky hands with the bar of soap and rubbed them across the broad expanse of his muscled chest. Moving to spread my soap covered hands down the length of his lean arms, my fingertips lovingly kneading the skin over his sinewy muscles.</p><p>\"It's your turn to stand up, Romeo.\"</p><p>My eyes drank in the perfection of his body as he rose to his full height. Taking a deep breath, I rubbed more soap into my hands. They slid against the planes of his finely sculpted abdomen and over the small of his back, lingering as they caressed the cheeks of his taut ass. I couldn't resist the urge to lightly stroke his hard cock with my soap covered hands, feeling it twitch as my fingers moved over his thick shaft. A tortured moan fell from his lips as I continued to softly caress him from base to tip.</p><p>\"Josephine, you need to stop. You are making it difficult not to fuck you.\"</p><p>Stefan grabbed the hand held attachment for the shower and turned on the water to let the spray wash the soap from his body, the suds running down the length of his body in soapy rivulets. He shut the water off, moving to sit back down with his back against the wall of the tub.</p><p>\"Come and sit with me.\"</p><p>Stefan turned me in the tub and pulled me against him, the back of my head resting against his solid chest. His large hands cupped both of my breasts, his fingertips lightly fondling my nipples. His hands continued to softly drift over my body as he softly hummed.</p><p>\"I think I could get used to this,\" I sighed with pleasure as my head rested in the crook of his neck.</p><p>His chest began to shake as he laughed at my words. \"Tell me Josephine, was it the bathtub that convinced you? Not my sexual prowess?\"</p><p>\"The sexual prowess stuff is great but I think this bathtub was the deal breaker,\" I retorted saucily, a small laugh bursting out as he sighed deeply in response.</p><p>Stefan shook his head as he stepped out of the bathtub, opening the drain to let the water out. He lifted me out of the tub, wrapping a bath towel around me and quickly rubbed me dry.</p><p>Walking naked into the bedroom, I eyed the large bed with apprehension. This was Stefan's bed. Did I just hop in and act nonchalant about it? Or did I need to wait for him to invite me to join him? I rolled my eyes at the absurdity of my thought process. I'd had sex with him six ways from Sunday and now I'm scared of his bed? There has to be something wrong with the way my mind works.</p><p>\"What is wrong? Why are you looking at the bed as if it will bite you?\" Stefan questioned as his eyes moved between me and the bed, his eyes sparkling with humor as he observed my obvious discomfort.</p><p>\"Stefan, I'm not used to all of this. I've never slept over at a man's house before. This is one of those situations where I'm struggling to catch up,\" I said, lowering my gaze to look at the floor.</p><p>Stefan pulled the dark brown duvet down and crisp white sheet down the bed. He sat down on the bed and rolled over onto his side, crossing his legs at his ankles, looking like temptation personified. He rubbed the bed provocatively with his large hand. His eyebrows waggled as he watched me stand nervously at the side of the bed.</p><p>\"Josephine, just get into bed. I promise not to bite. Unless you ask nicely,\" Stefan snapped his teeth at me, his fangs peeking out of the sexy smile that had curved his lips.</p><p>Rolling my eyes at him in annoyance, I sat down on the bed. His arms moved fluidly to gather me in his arms as he curled against my back. I felt one arm move to turn the bedside lamp off and to pull the covers over us. He snuggled against me, his head lowering to place kisses on the top of my shoulders.</p><p>\"Was that so difficult, vackra?\" His mental voice had a teasing tone to it.</p><p>\"I'm sorry I'm like this, Stefan,\" I whispered, my body melting against him. His nose ran against the side of my neck, his lips pressing a soft kiss against the skin there.</p><p>\"Never apologize for how you feel. I have had plenty of time to adjust to our relationship. You have had only weeks,\" Stefan murmured against my shoulder, his lips cool against my warm skin. \"You cannot imagine what it was like knowing I would find you someday, only to be faced with centuries of being alone. Your face haunted me when I was awake and when I slept. I was always looking for you everywhere. It was frustrating and I was beginning to lose my patience.\"</p><p>He opened his mind to me and I let out a gasp when I saw the vivid picture of myself flicker in his mind. I appeared almost ethereally beautiful in his thoughts, my reddish blond hair falling in waves over my shoulders, framing my delicate oval face. My luminous eyes were green and large, shadowed with fringe of thick eyelashes. My cheekbones were high and delicate, my lips pouty as they curved up into a brilliant smile. I was slender and willowy with long and shapely legs.</p><p>Is this how I looked to him?</p><p>\"Now you know how exquisitely beautiful you are to me, Josephine. Du ?r en gudinna. You are a goddess.\"</p><p>I turned my head slightly to kiss his lips softly. \"I only had to wait a few weeks to find you. I can't imagine having to wait years to meet you. When I saw you that night on the beach, I can't describe what I felt. It was...powerful, like we had an instant connection. My body knew you were the one, Stefan. My head was just harder to convince.\"</p><p>\"I love you, vackra. Now sleep.\" He kissed my temple gently.</p><p>\"I love you. So very much,\" I mumbled, my eyes heavy as I struggled to stay awake.</p><p>\"Stay with me, Josephine. Forever.\" Stefan's soft mental voice was the last thing I remembered hearing as I drifted off to sleep.</p><p>The salty smell of the ocean and faint sounds of waves were the first thing I heard when I woke. Stretching slightly, I opened my eyes to see Stefan's side of the bed empty. I reached an arm to pull his pillow against me, curving my body around it. His scent was lingering there, musky and alluring. I released a sigh against the pillow, letting my mind drift to picture him laying beside of me. His long, lean body would be stretched naked across the bed. I imagined his handsome face inches from mine as he leaned down to kiss me. His sea blue eyes would be sparkling and his mouth would be soft, the blond stubble darkening his strong, square jaw line. Our lips would meet and time would stop.</p><p>Letting out a groan, I mentally doused myself with cold water.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I pressed my face against the pillow and my mind relaxed as I started to drift off to sleep again. I was jolted awake when I felt the bed move and Stefan's cool, naked body press against my back. His fingers skimmed across my skin to palm my full breasts in his large hands as he nuzzled my neck with his nose.</p><p>\"I could sense you were awake. Your thoughts were titillating and I could smell your arousal.\" His mental voice whispered into my mind, soft and alluring.</p><p>Instinctively I pressed back against him, letting my head fall back to rest against his shoulder, my ass pressing into hardness of his cock. One of his hands grasped my leg, pulling it back slightly to drape over his hip. His fingers ran up the outside of my thigh, brushing across my hip bones to descend to explore the wetness of my slick, hot folds. His mouth moved to place wet kisses on my neck, leaving a burning trail from the feel of his mouth on my skin. I boldly arched against him again, a small moan escaping from my lips.</p><p>\"Vackra, I cannot resist you. The feel of your skin....\"</p><p>Without waiting for a response, he sheathed himself inside of me and a growl of pleasure escaped from his throat. He withdrew almost completely and then thrust his hips to bury himself back inside of my moist, tight pussy. He began to move again in slower, fuller strokes as he rocked his hips against me languidly.</p><p>\"You are so hot and tight, Josephine. Jag ?lskar knulla dig. Din fitta ?r s?v?t.\"</p><p>I cried out as I pressed against him. Our rhythm was slow, his body taking the time to explore mine as one hand continued to palm my breasts with relish, the other rubbing small circles over my swollen clit. He was slow and methodical as we moved together, neither of us wanting the intimacy of the moment to end.</p><p>\"Stefan...\" I moaned softly, my body writhing against the firm and erotic feel of his hands on my skin. I couldn't hold back as I began to clench around him, causing his speed to increase, his thrusts long and deep. The slickness of my flushed skin slid against the silky hardness of his body, the coolness of his flesh against my own was intoxicating.</p><p>\"Ah, vackra. The way you feel makes me want to eat you alive.\"</p><p>His sexy mental words sent waves of electricity throughout my body, causing all lucid thoughts to leave my mind. My hands moved backwards to roughly grab his thick, blond hair. His lips drifted down my arm and his fangs scraped against my sensitive skin.</p><p>\"Don't stop, Stefan...\" I released another wanton moan, my hips grinding against him with more force. My heart was thudding in my chest and my breath was coming in gasps.</p><p>\"I will never stop fucking you.\" Stefan's hips bucked to accent each word he thought to me.</p><p>His fingers moved faster over my clit. His hips began to frantically drive faster inside of my pussy and our voices blended together in a symphony of sensual moans. We continued to move in perfect harmony together, I answered each of his thrusts with a slight roll of my hips, pressing harder against the rigidness of his cock inside of me.</p><p>Waves of ecstasy started to course through my body, my inner walls constricting, rhythmically clamping around him as my powerful orgasm overtook me. I turned my neck to the side, exposing my throat to him.</p><p>\"I want to feel you bite me when I come, Stefan.\"</p><p>His tongue ran over my neck and then I felt the sting of his fangs sinking into my skin. A broken cry fell from my lips as I clenched around him, shuddering in bliss. Stefan's hips moved erratically against me as he emptied inside of me, his mouth sucking gently against my neck. I felt his fangs retract only to be replaced by his tongue, lazily licking over the slowly disappearing puncture marks.</p><p>Slowly rolling to face him, our lips met in a tender kiss. Our tongues tangled together softly, reflecting the closeness of the moment we had shared. My hands ran along the length of his lean, muscled back to palm his toned ass, my leg moving to rest over his hip. His large hands spread across the small of my back, pressing me tightly against his chest.</p><p>My mouth left his to nestle my forehead against the crook of his neck and I sighed into the coolness of his skin, savoring the sweetness of the moment.</p><p>The only sound in the room was our breathing, my steady heartbeat and the sound of the waves breaking in the distance. His fingers gently stroked the curve of my thigh against him, his touch tender and reverent.</p><p>\"I spoke with my contact with the Council via e-mail last night. He will let me know what he discovers.\" Stefan's voice was still husky as it broke the silence that had settled over the room.</p><p>\"Stefan, he can be trusted, right?\" I asked uneasily. The last thing I needed was a vampire with a big mouth to start asking questions that needed immediate answers. Questions that I didn't really want to answer.</p><p>\"Of course. I have known him for 300 years, Josephine.\"</p><p>\"It just makes me nervous, Stefan. I trust you, I just don't trust him.\"</p><p>Reluctantly pulling out of his embrace, I stretched lazily as I walked into the bathroom. I froze as my eyes went blank and my mind misted over as a vision flashed in my head. I could see myself having dinner with Anna and Georgia, then a brief glimpse of myself on a crowded dance floor with them both, my head thrown back in laughter. The vision went hazy, blackness creeping around the edges to cloud the rest of the vision.</p><p>Shaking my head, I ran my fingers through my tangled hair. It was apparent I was going to be seeing Anna and Georgia tonight. The blackness to vision meant Stefan or Lukas was involved. I just hoped that Georgia could manage to not anger the sexy beast in the other room for one night.</p><p>\"By the way, Lukas is back. He planned an outing for all of us this evening. Something about drinks and dancing.\" Stefan's mental voice floated into my thoughts, a slight hint of humor coloring his words.</p><p>\"Yeah, yeah. Psychic human here, remember?\" I grumbled, walking across the bathroom to turn on the water in the shower.</p><p>I suddenly had the urge to crawl back into bed with Stefan and pull the covers over our head, groaning as I thought about dealing with Anna and Georgia's curiosity and their never-ending questions. Add Lukas to the equation and it was the perfect storm of annoyance and frustration. I stomped my foot in anger before I could stop myself.</p><p>\"Can't you make Lukas cancel the plans? You're kind of like his Dad, right?\"</p><p>I could hear Stefan's loud laughter to my question from the other room. I was glad someone found this situation humorous. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Letting out a deep sigh of frustration, I finished applying my makeup in the large mirror. I was still irritated that I had an evening planned out for me, even down to the small details of my clothing. I'd spoken to Anna earlier in the day about our dinner plans. The only thing that made this night bearable was knowing at some point in the evening Stefan and Lukas would meet up with us for drinks and dancing.</p><p>I rolled my eyes in the mirror as I thought of how excited Lukas was about going out as a group. He was as giddy as a school girl going on her first date, bouncing with enthusiasm as he picked through my closet, finding me the perfect outfit.</p><p>My thoughts drifted back to the events earlier in the day, my fingers absently running through the tousled waves of my hair.</p><p>A yoga mat was rolled out on the sunny patio and I was standing in the Extended Hand-to-Big-Toe pose, my breathing even and slow. Stefan's long body was stretched languidly in the lounge chair facing me and his sunglass covered eyes observed every movement of my body. We hadn't exchanged a word but the air was heavy with controlled lust. He never took his eyes off of me, his gaze heated as I moved from one pose to the next. More than once I'd seen him stroke himself through his shorts.</p> <p>Lukas appeared on the patio beside of my mat. \"So this is why Stefan can't stay away from you. I didn't think humans could be that flexible.\"</p><p>\"Lukas.\" The solitary word coming from Stefan's lips resonated with quiet power. Lukas pursed his lips, impatiently putting his hands on his hips.</p><p>I glanced over to see Lukas and Stefan's eyes locked in a silent conversation. Lukas finally gave into him, rolling his eyes and sticking his tongue out at Stefan defiantly.</p><p>\"Josie, are you finished doing your contortion routine? Will you come with me?\" Lukas questioned, his voice going up an octave in his excitement. He was bouncing on the balls of his feet, his eyes gleaming. I knew I might as well get this over with instead of dragging it out.</p><p>\"Go with him, vackra. Resistance is futile.\"</p> <p>My head snapped around to stare at Stefan, my eyebrows raising in surprise. \"You're quoting Star Trek now?\"</p><p>A quiet laugh shook his broad chest. He crossed his arms behind his head and reclined further in the chair, the muscles in his arms and chest rippling with the movement. A broad smirk broke across his chiseled face.</p><p>\"There is much you do not know about me. I am a man of intrigue.\"</p><p>Snorting, I lowered my leg to the ground. I bent over and rolled up the mat, placing it on a small table. I put my hands on my hips in mock annoyance and my mental voice was matter-of-fact when I sent him my thoughts.</p><p>\"Technically you're not a 'man', Stefan. And I know enough about you to safely say you're full of smart-assed arrogance.\"</p><p>Lukas was a blur of movement as he grabbed my arm, pulling me along with him as he led me quickly into the house. I was struggling to keep up with his speed and long strides as he dragged me along behind him.</p> <p>He pushed me into Stefan's bedroom, his hands proudly gesturing to a pile of bags on the bed. An immense smile was spreading across his handsome, aristocratic face.</p><p>\"You wanted to show me bags? Lukas...\" I said, a frown darkening my face as I gave him a look of contempt. I wasn't in the mood to play games with him.</p><p>Lukas dramatically rolled his eyes at me and let out a deep sigh. \"Not the bags, Josie. Let me show what's inside of the bags.\"</p><p>Watching with wide eyes, my mouth dropped as Lucas began pulling clothes of varying color and style out of the bags. I lost track of the number of dresses, blouses and jeans he tossed on the bed, gasping as I watched him start to stack shoe boxes on the floor. My eyes took note that all of the tags and boxes were from expensive designers and stores.</p><p>\"Lukas, what the hell is all of this?\" I swept my hand, gesturing to the piles of clothing stacked on the bed. He was digging through yet another bag, stopping to glance up at me with a look of exasperation on his refined face.</p><p>\"I was so excited yesterday that I went shopping with Anna. You need dressier clothing, Josie. You can't live in tank tops and yoga pants,\" Lukas said pointedly, his eyes critically sweeping over my outfit.</p><p>Stunned by his bluntness, I walked with trepidation to the edge of the bed, eying the clothes with confusion. My fingers drifted over the piles of clothing and I felt the flush of anger spread across my face.</p><p>\"Why do I need all of this, Lucas? I have plenty of clothes and the last thing I need is a personal shopper,\" I muttered through clenched teeth.</p> <p>Lucas sat down on the edge of the bed, crossing his legs and staring at me with his icy blue eyes. He wrapped his long fingers around his knee. He turned his head to the side, silently staring at me. A small smile touched his thin lips.</p><p>\"You need this for many reasons, Josie. You've been living a half of a life and hiding from who you are for some reason. And you don't have to tell me why that is.\" He put up his hand, sighing. His eyes became distant as if lost in a memory. \"I can relate to you in many ways. I was considered an outcast when I was a human so I was forced to hide what I truly was. Being a homosexual man wasn't an acceptable thing to be when I was a human. Stefan saw past that and chose to be my friend. The two of you are obviously going to be together so I thought we should also be friends.\"</p><p>I unclenched my jaw and sat down next to Lukas, patting him lightly on the leg with my hand. He looked at my hand for a moment, his eyes misty as he quickly glanced away to focus his attention on a shoe box.</p><p>\"Lukas, you don't need to buy me anything to be my friend. I appreciate the thought, I do. It's really not necessary,\" I said, trying to make my voice gentle and soothing. I couldn't stay angry at him. He was aggravating and impetuous at times but his intentions were genuine.</p><p>\"Stefan is truly happy for the first time since I've known him, Josie. You have to understand how happy that I am that you're finally together. And sweetheart, I didn't buy you anything. You can thank Mr. Romance and his Black American Express card for your new wardrobe.\" His cool hand covered mine for a moment. He stood up, walking across the room to open the doors to the expansive walk in closet. He began moving quickly from the bed to the closet, hanging dresses and blouses on hangers. Our little heart to heart chat was apparently over and I was left wondering why Stefan had decided to purchase me a new wardrobe.</p><p>He came to a sudden halt beside of me, his eyes sparkling as if he'd read my mind.. \"Let it go, Josie. What's done is done. He loves you and he'd give you the moon if he could. Don't make a big deal over this. Now go get that hot body of yours in the shower and get ready. I'll get an outfit ready for you.\"</p><p>Shaking myself slightly, I pulled myself out of my memory. Walking into the bedroom, I admired the emerald green dress draped across the bed. Picking it up carefully, I moved to stand in front of the full-length mirror. I carefully pulled the chiffon fabric over my body, adjusting my breasts in the ruched bodice of the strapless dress.</p><p>My fingers were reaching for the zipper when I heard Stefan approaching. I smiled when I saw his reflection in the mirror, stopping to lean against the door frame. I heard his sharp intake of breath as his eyes moved slowly over the length of my body.</p><p>\"Can you zip me up?\" I asked, grasping my hair in my hands and lightly lifting it away from the zipper.</p><p>He pressed off of the frame and slammed the door closed behind him, swaggering to stand behind me. His large hands pulled the zipper slowly up the fabric of the dress and his blue eyes locked on mine in the mirror, compelling and magnetic. His hands lingered on my shoulders, slowly running a finger up against the nape of my neck. I shivered from the feel of his hands on my skin, cool and sensual.</p><p>\"It is a pity to see your body covered, even if you do look beautiful. Every man will want to take you home with him. I am the lucky one that has the pleasure of taking you...home.\" His voice was low and smug. He stretched out on the bed, his dark jeans snug over his muscular thighs and his white dress shirt was open, leaving his sculpted chest exposed.</p><p>\"It's a good thing I love an incredibly sexy vampire. And you know I don't want to go, Stefan. We could just stay here...you could just unzip this dress and we could just forget about going out....\" I said, doing my best to sound sexy and persuasive as my eyes roamed over the length of his body on the bed behind me.</p><p>Stefan raised an eyebrow in amusement, flashing me fanged smile. \"As much as I would enjoy getting you out of that incredibly sexy dress, we both agreed.\"</p><p>\"I know, I know,\" I mumbled, putting my hands on my hips.</p><p>I was starting to hate it when he was right.</p><p>And as much as I didn't want to go, even I had to admit the dress was stunning. It stopped right above my knees and was snug in all of the right places. It had a thin, black silk belt that tied in the front of the dress around the waist. The deep green of the dress made my eyes almost luminous and my reddish-blond hair shine.</p><p>\"I cannot wait to see what you have on underneath the dress, vackra. I am going to enjoy ripping it off of you later.\"</p><p>I felt a rosy blush creep across my cheekbones at his mental words, my heart rate increasing as I visualized him ripping the dress from my body with his powerful hands.</p><p>\"You need to stop with the sexy talk, Romeo.\"</p><p>I heard him chuckle as I sat down on the bench at the end of the bed. I slipped on strappy black sandals that crisscrossed around my ankles. The heel was higher than I was used to wearing, close to four inches high. Standing up, I smoothed the dress with one hand, taking a last look in the mirror.</p><p>\"What do you think?\" I questioned, my eyes searching his in the reflection of the mirror.</p><p>\"Turn around, Josephine.\" Stefan's voice was deep and commanding. I swiveled around to face him, biting my lower lip as I met his piercing stare. His blue eyes darkened instantly and his gaze slid slowly and seductively downward, lingering on my legs in the heels. He rose from the bed, walking to stand in front of me, our bodies so close I could feel his cool breath against my hair.</p><p>Looking up at him, I realized that with these heels on I was much taller than usual. I leaned in close to him, wrapping my fingers around his biceps. My lips brushed against his smooth neck and my tongue flicked out to lick the shell of his ear teasingly. His body shuddered slightly against my mouth, his head falling back slightly.</p><p>\"It is obvious I want to fuck you, vackra. Why are you tempting me?\"</p><p>\"I'm still hoping I can change your mind,\" I murmured against his throat. My fingers dropped to rub against the front of his jeans, feeling the hardness of his cock against my hand. I continued to kiss and lick his neck, my hand stroking him through the heavy denim.</p><p>Stefan lowered his head to my neck, lightly scraping his fangs against my skin. His lips pressed kisses up the length of my throat until our lips met. I felt his sharp fangs against my mouth and I deliberately let the point of one scrape against my tongue. Moaning softly, I pressed my bloody tongue into his mouth and deepened the kiss.</p><p>His strong hands gripped my arms and he pushed me backwards towards the bed. His fingers roughly tugged on the zipper, letting the dress slide down to rest around my waist. I was pushing his shirt over his shoulders when the bedroom door burst open. Lukas was cursing loudly as he blurred to stand beside of us.</p><p>\"Fucking hell! Josie, Anna and Georgia are downstairs. You need to get your ass downstairs before Mr. Romance loses it! \" Lukas exclaimed, bending to pick up Stefan's shirt and tossing it to him. He pulled my dress up, pulling the zipper back into place, taking me by the wrist and leading me out of the bedroom like a child that had been caught with their hand in the cookie jar.</p><p>I uselessly tugged at the iron-like grip he had on my wrist. \"Did anyone ever tell you that you're a cock blocker, Lukas?\" I huffed as we walked down the stairs. Lukas chose to ignore me, muttering under his breath about needing a hose to separate us since we acted like we were in heat.</p><p>\"It does no good to try to insult him, vackra. I love you.\" His mental voice called after me, filled with affection and aggravation.</p><p>\"I love you too. I'm trying to remember why we agreed we let Mr. Cock Blocker talk us into a fun night out.\"</p><p>Lukas didn't release the grip he had on my wrist until we reached the living room. Georgia and Anna were waiting, both of their eyes wandering around the large room. Georgia noticed me first, letting out an excited squeal and almost ran to tackle me.</p><p>\"So this is where you've been hiding, huh?\" Georgia asked as she hugged me tightly, almost lifting me off my feet.</p><p>\"I can't breathe, Georgia.\"</p><p>She released me and took a step back, her gaze sweeping over me critically. A knowing smile crept over her face. \"So, you two are back together again. I can't wait to hear how this happened.\"</p><p>I was wondering if it was too late to make a run for it when Anna stepped in and saved me from Georgia's flood of questions.</p><p>\"Can you save the interrogation for the car ride, Georgia? I'm hungry and you know what happens when I'm hungry. My bitch level rises dramatically,\" Anna said, grabbing Georgia's elbow to lead her to the door. Trailing along behind them, I glanced back to see Stefan on the stairs above. A small smile pulled at his lips, softening his handsome face.</p><p>\"Jag ?lskar dig, vackra. I will see you soon. Be safe.\"</p><p>My lips curved into an unconscious smile at his mental words, my eyes prickling with tears. I sent him back my own message. \"Please hurry. I don't know how long I can do this without you.\"</p><p>\"Josie!\" Anna's voice broke into our silent conversation. She was impatient, her toe tapping out a frantic rhythm of the floor. \"You'll see him in two hours. Can you tear yourself away from him to actually spend some time with us?\"</p><p>Guilt stabbed at my chest. It was Anna that had supported me during those dark days when I was mourning Stefan's disappearance. The least I could do was spend time with my two friends and attempt to have fun.</p><p>\"I'm sorry, Anna. Let's go.\"</p><p>Anna grinned in triumph, linking her arm through mine as we walked out to Georgia's car together. I was buckling my seat belt when I heard Anna's voice from the back seat. \"If you think you're off the hook for abandoning us for days, you're crazy.\"</p><p>Closing my eyes, I banged my head against the head rest of the car seat. There was no escape now, I was a willing captive to their oncoming interrogation.</p><p>Georgia let out a loud peal of laughter as she started her car, roaring down the driveway. I didn't have to be psychic to know it was going to be a long night.</p><p>We were sitting at a small table in the corner of Ku De Ta, a local hot spot in Seminyak. The front portion of the building was a beautifully decorated restaurant and the back was a multi-tiered night club. It was exactly the place I usually avoided due to the large crowds of people. I'd have to work harder to keep out the visions and emotions since this was on my personal 'no-no' list.</p><p>Checking my mental shields, I was surprised to find it in place and stronger than normal. The shields were getting so strong that only an occasional a vision would manage to break through and blocking emotions were easier than ever for me to do. It was yet another thing to tuck away for me to consider later.</p><p>We were halfway through dinner and both Georgia and Anna had both been amazingly reserved, making idle chit chat about work, shopping and men they'd dated recently. I tuned out most of their conversation, occasionally sneaking a glance at my watch and sipping my glass of wine. I'd just started to really relax when the conversation turned to Stefan and I immediately tensed. It was if they could smell blood in the water and they went in for the kill.</p><p>\"What was Hunky's story for leaving, Josie?\" Georgia asked, reaching for her glass of wine. She took a sip and continued. \"I thought you were finished with him and didn't want his drama.\"</p><p>Twisting my napkin in my lap, I sighed deeply. \"Stefan had business issues to deal with. He left me a note and it ended up getting misplaced. I can't stay mad over a misunderstanding, Georgia.\"</p><p>Anna was uncharacteristically quiet. She absently traced patterns on the tablecloth with her fingers, a wry smile on her lips. It was obvious Anna was not going to come to my aid or be of any assistance.</p><p>\"Business issues and misunderstandings?! Is that what they call it when men go off for days only to come back and grovel for forgiveness? \" Georgia fixed a pointed look me at over her wine glass, her tone holding a note of mockery. \"And do they not have phones where he does his 'business'?</p><p>Tensing at her scathing tone, I plastered a tight smile on my lips and did my best to keep my voice low. \"Georgia, I don't want to do this with you. He admitted he made a few mistakes when he left,\" I paused for a moment, trying to collect my thoughts. \"I made mistakes too. He came to Anna's house and tried to explain where he'd been. I basically told him to fuck off and hit the road.\"</p><p>\"She was a real bitch to him if it makes you feel better, Georgia. He tried to talk and she gave his fine ass the boot.\" Anna interjected coolly, glancing at me with a finely arched eyebrow as if challenging me to argue with her.</p><p>I shot her a look of betrayal, folding my arms across my chest defensively. This was exactly why I didn't want to come out tonight. They both had my best interests at heart although they weren't good at showing it. Neither could understand my relationship with Stefan. They had no idea that the man I was with was a millennia old vampire that shared my gift. It was almost too much for me to comprehend on a good day.</p><p>\"Good. He deserved it,\" Georgia said smugly. \"Josie, you can't let some hot piece of ass stroll in and think he's going to run your life. I told you to hook up. There's a difference between a night of hot sex and a relationship.\"</p><p>Angrily slamming my hand on the table, I leaned forward in my seat slightly. I drew in a calming breath, trying to keep my voice level as I addressed Georgia. \"I know the difference between a hot sex and a relationship, Georgia. I happen to be lucky enough to have them both with him.\" My anger waned as my thoughts drifted to Stefan. When I spoke again, my tone was softer. \"We love each other. The first night we met, it was if everything aligned for me. It was like I'd known him forever.\"</p><p>Anna and Georgia shared a skeptical look across the table. Minutes passed, and an uneasy silence hung over the table as we finished our dinner and drinks. It was Georgia that finally broke the silence.</p><p>She shrugged her shoulders, a large grin breaking over her face. \"If this is what you want, I support you. Hunky is easy on the eyes and if he makes you happy, I'm happy.\"</p><p>\"Can you please call him Stefan, Georgia? Hunky just sounds wrong.\" I narrowed my eyes at Georgia and felt my lips curve into a small smile.</p><p>\"Stefan. Hunky. Whatever.\" Georgia waved me off dismissively, focusing her attention on the contents of her purse.</p><p>\"If the drama portion of the evening is over, can we move on to the fun part of the night? I feel like dancing,\" Anna said, making a motion with her hand to their waiter for the check.</p><p>\"Ooh, I am! Let's go, there are men to conquer.\" Georgia clapped her hands with enthusiasm.</p><p>The check was settled and we made our way to the back of the building. I could already hear the music playing, the thumping sound of dance music assaulting my ears as we stepped into the darkened club. Neon lights were flashing and it took a moment for us to adjust to the combination of the darkness of the club and the random flashing lights. My eyes scanned the room, watching people writhing and moving against each other on the already crowded dance floor.</p><p>\"Let's get a drink!\" Anna yelled over the music, grabbing our arms and pulling us towards the bar area. Anna leaned across the bar, placing their drink order. A few moments later she pressed a glass into our hands, smiling wickedly. \"Sex on the Beach!\"</p><p>I downed my drink in two large swallows. After barely surviving the dinner fiasco and being overwhelmed with the crowd, I needed the liquid courage. Placing my empty glass on the edge of the bar, I followed Georgia and Anna towards the dance floor without any hesitation. The alcohol had loosened my normal resistance to dancing, I actually found myself enjoying the music, my body moving in time to the pounding beat.</p><p>\"I can't believe you're dancing with us. Hunky must be doing something right if we can get you out on the dance floor. \"Georgia leaned in to yell in my ear. I threw back my head, letting a laugh escape. My laughter stopped when I felt cool, strong hands wrap around my waist and my back came into contact with a hard, muscular chest. My body pressed against him as he moved closer against me.</p><p>\"Josephine, I see you started without me.\" Stefan leaned over to whisper against my ear, his voice spreading over me like warm honey, cloying and smooth. Our bodies moved as one, his hips pushing against me as we swayed to the music.</p><p>It was if the whole crowd disappeared around us, the air around us seemed charged with electricity. I let out a moan as his large hands roamed across my body, drifting from my arms to lightly brush my across my breasts, going lower to grip my hips as I moved against him. My arms lifted to wind around his neck, my head falling back against his shoulder as we writhed against each other seductively in time to the music.</p><p>The song changed to a slower, pulsing beat. He spun me around to face him and I felt my dress creeping up my leg as his strong thigh slipped between my legs. I ran my fingers through his thick, blond hair and my arms draped around his shoulders, our hips grinding together sensually. We were acting out publicly what we did behind closed doors. We moved together flawlessly.</p><p>Every cell in my being was screaming out for more and my need for him was flickering over my body like flames scorching my skin. I was aching to feel more than just his hands on me. Reading my mind, his lips covered mine hungrily and his tongue delved into the heat of my mouth. Our tongues twisted lazily against each other, sending darts of desire though me. His grip on me tightened as our kiss deepened, his hands wandering down my back and slightly cupping my ass with his large hands. I groaned into his mouth when I felt the hardness of his cock press against my hip.</p><p>\"Jesus H. Christ. Get a fucking room!\" Lukas snapped, grabbing my shoulder and shaking me. Lukas' abrupt words caused everything to come back into focus around us. I flinched as the loud music and the din of the crowd assaulted my ears.</p><p>Disappointed, I let out a heavy sigh as Stefan pulled his lips from mine. I glanced up at him, our eyes locking in the darkness of the room. There was a spark of mischief in them and his lips were curved in a wicked smile.</p><p>\"That was nothing, vackra. Either we find a dark corner so I can fuck you, or we leave. Soon.\" His mental words caused a shiver of excitement to run down my spine. I was frantically trying to think of a way to escape with Stefan. I'd had enough of this kind of fun for one evening.</p><p>\"Here's another drink, honey. After that little display I think you need it. Hell, I don't even smoke and I think I need a cigarette.\" Georgia pressed a glass in my hand, a look of astonishment on her face. The emotions resonating from Georgia were easy to read: she was slightly jealous, happy and extremely turned on after watching our floor show.</p><p>\"I had to break them up earlier tonight before you left for dinner. They're a bad influence on my pure, virginal mind,\" Lukas pouted, his voice whiny. He placed the back of his hand across his eyes dramatically, his face a mask of mock pain.</p><p>\"Bitch, please. You need to save that line for people that don't know you. There is nothing virginal or pure about your mind,\" Anna said as she grabbed his arm, pulling him behind her on the dance floor. \"Come on, buttercup. Let's dance.\"</p><p>Stefan had a look of amusement on his face as he watched them disappear into the crowd. He looked down at me, his mouth twitching at the corners. \"I like your Anna. She is a ball-buster.\" Stefan laughed, the sound booming above the noise of the crowd.</p><p>His loud laughter drew the attention of many people who began turning around to look for the man that matched the sexy voice. I could see the mixture of desire and envy on many of the faces of men and women alike as they took in Stefan's impressive frame. Jealously tugged at me, even though I understood their attraction to him. He was more gorgeous than usual tonight, his six-foot-four muscular frame towered over the crowd and the white dress shirt stretched across the expanse of his massive chest. His legs were long and his tight jeans hugged his muscled thighs.</p><p>Desire coiled in the pit of my stomach as I shamelessly admired him. I fought the need to rip his shirt off to let my tongue run over the sinewy muscles hidden underneath the fabric. Sighing deeply, I knew I needed to pull myself together before I started searching out dark corners to have my way with him.</p><p>Stefan's face spread into a wide grin. He'd been listening to my internal dialogue and not only was enjoying it, he was relishing in my desire for him.</p><p>I took a long drink from the glass I'd been holding, wincing as the alcohol burned my throat as I swallowed. Glancing down and the glass and back up to her, I wrinkled my nose. \"What the hell is this, Georgia? It tastes like pure alcohol.\"</p><p>\"It's a Long Island Ice Tea, honey. Drink up.\" Georgia clinked her glass against mine in a mock toast. \"Stefan, I'm glad to see you decided to come back. Hopefully you'll invest in a phone that works while you're away doing your business.\"</p><p>Gasping, I looked at Georgia in disbelief. I couldn't believe she'd say something like that to deliberately antagonize him. I was finished trying to defend her. She was on her own now.</p><p>A tense silence settled over us, thick and heavy. The music was loud, people laughing and dancing around us. All I could feel was the pounding of my heart and the uneasiness that had fallen over the conversation. Stefan's torso slightly stiffened beside of me, his normally handsome face becoming severe as anger darkened his features. I wrapped my free arm around him, my fingers caressing his side.</p><p>I pushed my mental thoughts to him, sincere and full of emotion. \"Hey, remember that I love you. And we're past this, even if Georgia isn't, Stefan. It doesn't matter what she thinks. You're better than this petty bullshit.\"</p><p>His tense muscles relaxed minutely after hearing my mental words. Our eyes met and a small smile broke across on my face. There was still anger shadowing his face but his eyes softened slightly as he looked at me. His gaze stayed locked on my face as he spoke to Georgia. His voice was absolutely emotionless and the expression on his face was hard as he started to speak.</p><p>\"Georgia, once again you find it necessary to meddle in Josephine's affairs. Our relationship has nothing do with you or your feelings. I owe you no explanations, Georgia. I love her and I will spend the rest of our time together making up for my mistakes.\"</p><p>Georgia swallowed hard, her face paling under the weight of his words. Her eyes glittered with anger as she looked at him. \"Here's the thing, Stefan,\" Georgia spat at him with venom in her voice, causing his head to snap sharply to look at her. \"You didn't see her. When I walked into her house the night you left, she was a mess. She was thinking you were just another person that had abandoned her. All she could do was say 'He's gone.'\" I had to struggle to hear her voice over the music even though I knew Stefan didn't have the same issue. Georgia let her eyes wander over the crowd before returning her red-rimmed eyes to him. \"So maybe you're right, Stefan. Your relationship doesn't have to do anything with me. But I won't see her broken like that again.\"</p><p>Stefan grimaced at her words and turned to look at me, his eyes filled with a mixture of dread and curiosity. Shrugging my shoulders, I let my mind flash back to the day I thought he'd left me and the conversation I'd had with Georgia in my living room. My eyes closed on their own accord, the painful memory almost too much to bear.</p><p>\"You gotta tell me something, Josie. Did you and Stefan have a fight?\" Georgia asked, her eyes questioning. She rubbed my arm softly, sighing heavily. She was obviously at a loss as to what to do and I wasn't giving her much to work with.</p><p>Shaking my head, my face was expressionless. \"A fight,\" I snorted, running my fingers through my tangled hair for what had to be the 50th time of the day. \"No, I don't know what the hell is going on, Georgia. Normally if he goes somewhere, he leaves me a note. There's no note. He's gone,\" I paused for a moment as the realization of my own words sunk in. My voice cracked when I was finally able to speak again. \"He's gone.\"</p><p>\"Honey, he could be at the store. Or home. Maybe he's running errands or doing something besides being up your ass.\" Georgia waved her hand in dismissal. \"Men are a dime a dozen. There's a hundred of him out there, Josie. You shouldn't be tied down anyway. You're young and...\"</p><p>\"I don't want a hundred other men, Georgia,\" I snapped, my eyes stinging with tears. \"I want him. I finally find him and now he's gone.\"</p><p>\"Holy fucking hell. You love him?\" Georgia asked, her voice incredulous and raising in volume. \"You love him?! Josie, what the fuck?\"</p><p>I came out of the recollection with a deep gasp like I'd been under water for too long. It made all of the fear and doubt I had pushed away resurface, my chest clenching in pain at the memory.</p><p>\"I will never leave her like that again, Georgia. That I can promise you. Can you tell the others we are leaving?\" His voice was thick with emotion and his handsome face was grim. \"Please.\"</p><p>Georgia nodded, pulling me to her in a hug. She pulled away, kissing me on the cheek briefly. She shot Stefan a sharp look before disappearing into the crowd.</p><p>Stefan's fingers intertwined with mine as we made our way through the crowd, his shoulders tight with anxiety. He was silent as we walked to his car, the only sound were my heels as they clicked out a staccato rhythm on the pavement. He pulled me along and my legs struggled to keep up with his long, purposeful strides. He opened the door for me, swiftly closing it behind me after I settled into the car. Seconds later he was in the seat beside of me and his eyes were staring blankly out the windshield. I nervously twisted my hands in my lap as I waited for him to talk, my stomach churning with apprehension.</p><p>\"Is that how you felt, Josephine? It was if you had given up,\" Stefan muttered, his voice quiet. I could see the despair etched on his handsome face. It was obvious he hadn't truly forgiven himself for leaving, even though he'd insisted that I let the misunderstanding go.</p><p>\"Yeah, Stefan. That's how I felt at that moment. Even though I knew I loved you, I was still trying to deny it. I knew that first night we met you were it for me. And then you left....I realized I never told you how I truly felt. So not only was I torn apart because you were gone, I was mad at myself for letting you slip away without telling you I loved you,\" I whispered, my hand reaching for his. I brought it to my lips, placing a kiss on the back of his hand.</p><p>\"Didn't you tell me I was supposed to forgive myself, Stefan? Why can't you do the same?\"</p><p>His head turned to look at me, his soulful eyes searching my mine. A remorseful smile broke over his face as he leaned over the console to press his lips against mine gently. He lightly kissed my nose before moving to turn the car on.</p><p>\"Did I mention that I do not like to be wrong, vackra?\" Stefan asked, his voice lighter and had a teasing tone to it.</p><p>Laughing, my hand reached to rest on his thigh. \"No, but join the club. I hate it when you're right.\"</p><p>The ride home was quiet and comfortable. He seemed lighter, his normal swagger returning as we pulled into the garage. He blurred to my side of the car and extended his hand to me. I winked, placing my much smaller hand in his as he smoothly pulled me out of the car and into his arms. He tossed me over his shoulder and walked into the house with me kicking and squirming against him.</p><p>\"Stefan, put me down!\" I squealed against the small of his back. I was only half-hearted in my attempt to escape, since I had the pleasure of admiring the view of his firm ass from this angle. I was just getting ready to playfully struggle against him again when I felt a smack on my ass. I should have been angry at his mischievous swat, instead I felt arousal tingling in my stomach. All it took was a simple look or touch from him to set my body on fire, the intensity painfully delicious.</p><p>\"Did you just spank me, Stefan?\" I asked quietly, jumping when another playful smack from his hand made contact with my ass. He was silent as he carried me quickly through the house, walking up the stairs to the master bedroom. He tossed me on the bed and my body bounced from the impact.</p><p>Stefan stalked across the room to lower himself in the chair in the corner of the room, his sharp eyes watching me. He still hadn't spoken and his thoughts were intentionally jumbled as I tried to take a mental peek to see what he was planning.</p><p>Struggling to sit up on the bed, my heart was racing as my eyes searched his face. I ran a shaky hand through the tangled waves of my hair, slightly biting my lip.</p><p>\"Stand up, Josephine.\" His voice was low and demanding. There was a slight huskiness lingering in his tone.</p><p>I crawled to the edge of the bed, standing up unsteadily. His eyes traced the contours of my body slowly, lingering on the swell of my breasts, moving to admire the curve of my hips and finally stopping to rake over the length of my legs. A shrewd smile curved his lips as I nervously stood in front of him. The sound of his mental voice floated through my mind, his tone smooth and commanding.</p><p>\"Take off your dress and stay where you are. Do not move except to do as I tell you.\"</p><p>\"Stefan,\" I could hardly lift my voice above a whisper. His eyes were wild. I could barely make out any blue in the blackness of his eyes.</p><p>\"No more talking. I asked to you to remove your dress, Josephine.\" Stefan's voice resonated powerfully in the quiet room. His body was tense as he leaned forward in the chair, ready to pounce on me at any time.</p><p>Twisting my arms behind me, I shakily pulled the zipper down the back of the dress. The fabric slipped down the length of my body to pool around my feet. I gave the dress a nudge away with the toe of my shoe, standing before him in my strapless black bra and panties. My heart rate increased as I waited for him to continue.</p><p>Stefan was motionless as he continued to stare at me, his gaze predatory. He slowly rose from the chair, walking across the room to slowly circle me. My hands longed to reach out and touch him, but he stayed just out of my grasp, making it impossible for me to do it and not move.</p><p>\"Remove your bra and panties.\"</p><p>Nervously licking my lips, I reached to unclasp my bra and let it drop from my fingers on the floor. My hands fumbled as I hooked my fingers around the sides of my panties, bending to push them down my legs. As I stood to face him again, his eyes were still silently appraising me and his hands were clenched at his sides.</p><p>\"Perfect. Keep on the shoes, vackra. I want you to wear them while I fuck you.\" His voice was almost a growl as he continued to watch me standing before him.</p><p>My heart was thumping against my chest and my entire being was vibrating with need. Wetness spread between my thighs and my knees began to weaken, my emotions whirling and spinning out of control. I wasn't sure if I should be turned on or appalled at being dominated like this. Or both.</p><p>I opened my mouth to talk but his finger pressed softly against my lips, effectively stopping any words from escaping. He stepped closer, slowly moving the finger from my lips to move below my chin, tilting my face up to look at him. He circled me again, tracing a finger across my back from one shoulder to the other, the coolness of his skin causing me to shiver.</p><p>When he finally stood to face me again, his mouth was arranged in a hard smile, lines of concentration deepening along his brows and under his eyes.</p><p>\"Undress me, Josephine.\"</p><p>Hesitating for a moment, I was powerless to resist him. My hands rushed to his chest, struggling against the buttons of his shirt. When the last one released, my fingers pushed the shirt over his broad shoulders and down the length of his long, muscular arms. I lowered my hands to fumble with the button and slowly lowered the straining zipper on his jeans. I couldn't stop my moan of desire as his cock sprang out, slapping against his stomach once it was freed from the confines of the denim. Swallowing thickly, I hastily shoved the fabric down his legs.</p><p>Stefan absently kicked his jeans away from him. His tongue darted out to lick along his lower lip in anticipation, his hand wrapping around my arm to pull me back to stand in front of him. His fingers began a path along my jaw, dragging along the side of my neck to slowly trace the circle of my nipple, the skin pebbling from the electric touch of his skin against mine.</p><p>\"Lay down on the bed.\"</p><p>Obeying his mental command, I stretched my body across the bed. He leaned over me and his smooth hands pushed my thighs apart. His long fingers drifted lightly over my clit and wet folds, slipping them slowly inside of me. My hips lifted off the bed, moaning softly. His eyebrow raised slightly, his lilting mental voice seductively entering my mind.</p><p>\"Always so wet for me. Are you ready for me to fuck you now?\"</p><p>Arching my head into the bed, I thrust my breasts higher and my wet pussy into his hand. He settled between my legs and his tongue licked along my inner thigh to flick against my swollen clit. His thumb replaced his tongue, slowly rubbing a tight circle around my clit. He leaned over my body to wrap his mouth around my nipple, rolling it gently with his tongue. He raised his head to look at me, his blue eyes hooded and glazed. I could tell by the expression on his face he was waiting for an answer.</p><p>\"Stefan. Please fuck me....\"</p><p>One of his hands took my wrist, stretching my arm above my head. His other hand reached for my other wrist, repeating the motion. He clasped both of my wrists in one of his large hands and his chest pressed against me. His hard cock slid inside of me with one swift roll of his hips, a growl rumbling in his chest as he fully entered me. He began slowly thrusting with deep strokes, his breath ragged against my face. His mouth found its way instinctively to mine and my lips parted to meet his. There was nothing gentle about this kiss, his lips were hard and rough against mine, his tongue mimicking the thrusts of his cock inside of me. Pulling my knees back farther, I cried out as he slipped completely inside, completely filling me with his large cock.</p><p>\"Oh god, Stefan. Fuck!\"</p><p>His mouth continued his sensual assault on mine as his speed increased. Our bodies slid against each other, my hips rocking to meet each surge of his cock. My body was consumed with heat, my passion for him was overwhelming and all-consuming. He could have me a million different ways and it would never be enough.</p><p>He pulled his lips from mine, his mouth descending to the crook of my neck. His hand continued to hold my wrists above my head and I arched against him as I felt his fangs sink into the skin on my neck. My orgasm was explosive, the feel of his fangs and lips on my neck caused me to clasp around him tightly. I violently shuddered against him and triggered his own climax. He pulsed inside of me as he pulled his fangs from my neck. My blood was trickling down his chin as his head fell back, a roar exploding from his mouth in ecstasy.</p><p>\"Jag kan inte f? nog av dig!\"</p><p>Stefan's body trembled against mine and his hands released the grip on my wrists. My fingers reached up to wipe my blood from his chin and his tongue swiftly darted out to lick at them greedily.</p><p>He fell to his side, pulling me along with him so we were lying face to face on the bed, his long leg draping across my thigh. His eyes were closed and his large hand ran down the length of my back in a gentle caress. For a brief unguarded minute, his thoughts tumbled out freely and his mind was completely open to me. He was blissful, the happiness he felt bordered on euphoria. His thoughts were consumed with the unwavering love he felt for me, the sheer emotion he was feeling was almost too much for me to understand.</p><p>My heart twisted when I felt his fear of my limited human life span creep into the boundaries of his mind, his thoughts darkening as he worried about me leaving him, either on my own volition or by his greatest fear: in my death. He was uncertain that I would choose to change to stay with him and this terrified him.</p><p>As quickly as his thoughts flooded my mind, he closed them off to me like a door slamming shut to an unwanted visitor. He sighed deeply in regret and his eyes closed to avoid my anxious stare. I couldn't force him to look at me, although I'd try my best to reassure him.</p><p>Curling myself around him, I opened my thoughts to him, hiding nothing from him. I showed him the strength of my feelings, the curiosity I felt at how he was able to unlock a side of me I kept hidden away. I focused on the ferocity of my love for him and how meeting him was the one thing in my life that made me the happiest, how I'd finally found a sense of home with him. My throat ached with unshed tears when I realized that I was in so deep now, I couldn't imagine my life without him beside of me. I needed him as much as he needed me.</p><p>Stefan was silent as he pulled me closer to him. I felt him draw in an unnecessary breath and his shaky exhale against my hair. His mental voice was soft as it brushed against my mind. \"I love you, Josephine. No matter what you choose to do, I am eternally yours. Jag ?r din och du ?r min. F?r evigt.\"</p><p>With a whimper from me, I reclaimed his mouth with mine, turning my head to drink him in. Our mouths met with wet need, desperate to prove to each other the depth of our love.</p><p>I knew beyond a doubt that I loved him and didn't want to live without him. It was up to me to figure out if one lifetime was enough. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Pulling on a pair of capri yoga pants and a tank top the next morning, I yanked a brush through my tangled hair as my eyes swept over Stefan's sleeping form on the bed. He was gloriously naked and his arms were clutching a pillow against his broad chest, his face smooth in sleep. His long, muscled legs were stretched across the bed and the faint glow from the morning sun made his pale skin appear almost luminous. It was still hard for me to believe that this beautiful creature was mine for eternity if I wanted it. Did I want it?</p><p>Walking across the room to the large windows, my eyes took in the swell of the waves in the distance. I had avoided relationships for 28 years and presently I was considering spending an eternity of lifetimes with the vampire behind me. The thought intrigued and terrified me at the same time. I considered the odd changes to my body, the almost instant healing of his bite marks, the changes to my mental shields, our ability to read each other's thoughts....it was making my head swim and causing a familiar fear to rise inside of me. I squashed the fear down, knowing that I loved him and being with him was right.</p><p>I quietly left the room, my bare feet padding down the staircase to head for the kitchen. I'd just stepped into the living room when I noticed a strange man sitting on Stefan's couch. I froze in my tracks, unable to move.</p><p>His strange, heavily accented voice stopped me in my tracks. \"You must be infamous Josephine I've heard so much about.\"</p> <p>He was tall and thin and his long arm stretched across the back of the couch. His hair was wavy, salt and pepper in color. His skin had the familiar iridescent pale quality of a vampire, however his had an almost tawny tinge and his features reflected his Spanish heritage. His brown eyes were sharp and piercing, his mouth thin with a slight cynical twist to it.</p><p>Slowly inching backwards towards the staircase to the master bedroom, my heart was racing against my chest. I wasn't sure if my mental thoughts could wake up Stefan but I figured now was a perfect time to try since I was alone with a potentially unfriendly vampire. I'm sure my mental voice was loud and probably sounded frantic it screamed out to him. \"Stefan! I need you to get down here. Now.\"</p><p>\"Yes, I'm Josie. I'm at a disadvantage here since you obviously know me and I'm at a loss as to who you are. I wake up to find a stranger sitting on my boyfriend's couch. You have to understand why I'm confused.\" My voice sounded level, even as my heart continued its frantic rhythm in my chest. I continued slowly backing towards the stairs as I kept sending mental pleas to Stefan.</p><p>A deep, mocking laugh came from him, his legs stretching to cross at his ankles. \"Boyfriend,\" he snorted, his eyebrow raising slightly. \"I suppose you're right. I know everything about you, Josephine. You are more beautiful than Stefan said you'd be.\"</p><p>\"Adolfo.\"</p> <p>I let out a sigh of relief as I heard Stefan's voice at the top of the stairs. He was a blur as he came to stand beside of me, a possessive arm wrapping tightly around my waist.</p><p>\"Josephine, since he is not polite enough to introduce himself, allow me to do the honors. This is my friend Adolfo Amaya. He is on the Council, the one I contacted about our concerns,\" Stefan said, his voice sharp as he made the introductions. Glancing up to look at his face, my stomach sank as I observed the displeased expression on his face. When he looked down at me, his eyes were filled with regret. I knew this wasn't a social visit since it was apparent Stefan knew exactly why this vampire was here and it wasn't to catch up on gossip.</p><p>\"Nice to meet you,\" I whispered, pressing myself closer to Stefan. I sent a mental thought to him, the tone cutting. \"Now would be a great time to tell me what the hell is going on, Stefan.\"</p><p>Stefan's mental voice laughed sardonically. \"He is here on Council business. We are going to need to go with him. Josephine, I need you to remain calm so he doesn't know we're communicating.\"</p><p>He needed me to remain calm?! This strange vampire was here to take us to parts unknown and I'm supposed to stand here and act like he's here for a cup of coffee? I took a deep breath and made the decision to let Stefan do the talking. He could easily pick through Adolfo's future to gauge his intentions.</p><p>\"Stefan, you know why I'm here so let's cut the pleasantries. I need you both to pack and come with me. There's a private plane waiting for us,\" Adolfo said in his heavily accented voice, clasping his hands across his lap. His dark eyes roamed around the room before fixing his stare back at Stefan.</p> <p>Watching as Stefan began to anxiously pace the room at a much faster pace than human speed, I uneasily sat down on the edge on a chair and chewed on my bottom lip. Lukas had warned us both this was going to happen. Even Stefan said they knew of me prior to us meeting. I wasn't expecting it to happen like this, especially from someone that Stefan said he could trust.</p><p>His mental voice was a warning in my head. \"Vackra, we have no choice in the matter. We cannot refuse. We have to go with him.\"</p><p>He stopped pacing to stand beside of me, his large hand caressing the strands of my hair. I glanced up at him, our eyes meeting again. His sea blue eyes were resigned and his mouth was tight and grim. He addressed Adolfo without bothering to look at him, his eyes still focused on mine as he spoke.</p><p>\"How long until we leave, Adolfo?\"</p><p>Adolfo stood and walked to the far wall of windows. He pulled back the arm of his suit jacket, glancing at his watch. \"We need to leave here within the hour. I'll be your escort until the Council convenes.\"</p><p>\"Fine,\" Stefan answered. He grabbed my elbow and led me up the steps into the bedroom. He closed the door behind us and his face finally relaxed.</p><p>As I started to open my mouth to speak, Stefan placed his index finger over his own lips and shook his head. He moved to tap his temple, reminding me to use mental speak. I rolled my eyes, remembering him telling me this would come in handy.</p><p>Damn it if he wasn't right again!</p> <p>\"Can you see what's going to happen? You know I can't see our futures, Stefan.\"</p><p>He was a blur as he moved back and forth from the bed to the closet, opening a large suitcase and placing jeans, shirts and shoes in the bag.</p><p>\"They are curious about you. It is not typical of a vampire to choose to be in a romantic relationship with a human and they want to evaluate the strength of it. Of course, they knew of you from my own mind as we discussed and I'm assuming Adolfo's questions piqued their interest. Start packing, vackra.\"</p><p>His hand pointed to the closet and motioned for me to start moving. My feet felt as if they were encased in cement as I walked towards the closet, my hands clenching until I felt my fingernails cut into my palms.</p><p>\"How long are we going to be there? And what they hell do they want to know, Stefan?\"</p><p>Turning away and not waiting for an answer, I focused on the closet and searched through the clothes Lukas had picked out for me. I mentally gave Lukas a thank you for his obsessive shopping behavior.</p><p>\"Two days at the most, Josephine. They want to assess your ability and make sure you are not a threat. If it puts your mind at ease, I see us returning back to Bali. There are things that are variables. However, I see us returning together.\"</p><p>\"Variables? What kind of variables?\"</p><p>Stefan shrugged his shoulders as he began getting dressed. \"That I do not know. Our gifts are not exact sciences.\"</p><p>Throwing up my hands in exasperation, I angrily pulled clothes from the closet and added it to Stefan's suitcase. I hurried into the bathroom and grabbed my cosmetic bag and toiletries from the sink, rushing back into the bedroom. Stepping back into the closet, I grabbed jeans and yanked a white smocked henley blouse from the hanger. Dressing quickly, I shoved my feet into a pair of ballet flats and ran my fingers through my hair to attempt to smooth the wild waves. I walked to the edge of the bed to stand beside Stefan, my hands trembling as I reached for the zipper of the suitcase to close the suitcase.</p><p>\"You look beautiful.\" His thought was a whisper as he turned to encircle me in his arms, pulling me against the hardness of his body. His blond head lowered to brush his lips against mine gently and I let myself relax into the comfort of his embrace. I reminded myself that he said we'd be returning together. The thought of losing him or coming home without him tore apart my insides.</p><p>His mental voice was a whisper as it entered my mind. \"Remember that I love you and I promise to keep you safe. For now, you need to follow my lead. If I tell you to answer in a certain way, it is imperative you do so.\"</p><p>Squaring my shoulders, I pulled away from him and my mouth was set in a grim line. \"I'm so going to kick your ass when we get home, Stefan. This is the vampire bullshit you were referring to I assume?\"</p><p>He chuckled aloud, breaking the silence of the room. He nodded and picked the suitcase off the bed with one hand. He hesitantly offered me his other hand, waiting for me to join him. I reluctantly put my hand in his and squeezed it affectionately.</p><p>Are you ready for this, vackra?</p><p>Releasing a resigned sigh, my shoulders drooped slightly. That was the million dollar question. I knew I'd never be ready to fly off to meet a council of vampires and rely on Stefan's mental queues to make it out alive but I didn't have a choice in the matter.</p><p>\"I'm as ready as I'll ever be. Let's go so we can come home.\"</p><p>The drive to Denpasar International Airport was silent and filled with tension. I clung to Stefan's arm during most of the car ride and Adolfo made no attempt to make any conversation as we drove along. I found myself looking out the tinted backseat window, the beautiful scenery a blur as my mind tried to make sense of what happened. Just this morning I was considering becoming one and now I was on my way to go before a Council of vampires that wanted to assess my abilities, most likely ridicule our relationship and all Stefan could tell me is that we'd be coming home together. On a scale of 1-10 on having a bad day this had to be a 40. Resting my head against the car seat, I turned my head slightly to look at Stefan sitting next to me.</p><p>He was staring straight ahead and his posture was rigid. The chiseled lines of his face were hard, his jaw set rigidly. One of his hands rested on my thigh and the other absently tapped on the seat. He was nervous and I was trying to figure out why since he'd assured me we'd be coming home together.</p><p>Closing my eyes, I mentally reached out to read his thoughts. The recurring theme in his mind was seeing us on a flight home together. The remainder of his vision was a jumble of black spots and blurs as his mind calculated the situation we were walking into, flashes of faces and conversation flying through his mind. His thoughts would change direction to focus on Adolfo and his mind became dark and sinister. I was almost dizzy from the speed of his mind working.</p><p>\"Stefan? Will you talk to me?\"</p><p>He didn't acknowledge my mental questions. His eyes sunglass covered eyes were fixed on the back of Adolfo's head. He was as still as a statue. A deadly, beautiful statue that had a case of nervous fingers.</p><p>I tried again. \"Stefan.\"</p><p>\"Josephine.\"</p><p>\"You need to talk to me. I have no idea what's going on. Your vision has black spots and blurs. What does that mean?\"</p><p>Watching as he swallowed heavily, the thick muscles in his neck tightened. \"You need to stay out of my mind, vackra.\"</p><p>\"Really, Stefan? Hello, pot and kettle. Have you met? You're inside my mind constantly. Explain the 'variables', please.\"</p><p>An arched eyebrow indicated his humorous surprise at my mental gibe. \"There are things that I cannot see. If a person involved changes their mind, it changes the vision. You know this, Josephine.\"</p><p>Sighing heavily, I turned my head back to stare straight ahead. I noticed Adolfo's sunglass covered eyes glancing at me in the rear view mirror. For a brief moment I was tempted to have a 'Lukas moment' and stick my tongue out at him. He was a pompous jerk and he'd betrayed Stefan's trust. I could feel my temper flaring and the heat spreading across my face. Stefan's hand tightened on my thigh in response to my thoughts, his responding mental chuckle breaking the tension of the moment.</p><p>\"You really need to stay out of my mind, Romeo. What is Adolfo's talent besides being a gigantic asshole?\"</p><p>Stefan cleared his throat to hide his laugh. \"His talent is useful in finding vampires. He is particularly adept at locating vampires that do not want to be found.\"</p><p>The magnitude of his words hit me like a sledgehammer. For over 900 years, he'd been a vampire that didn't want to be found. He'd traveled and been able to fade into obscurity even though he worked for the Administrative Board. Prior to meeting me, he would be called to complete an assigned task and when he was finished, his life of anonymity could resume. Did he regret finding and choosing to be with me since he'd previously lived so privately? I was putting him squarely in the spotlight of a life he didn't really like or want.</p><p>\"Josephine, I have no regrets being with you. I love you eternally. I have spent 200 years searching for you. This is one of those minor details that we deal with and move on from. Do not worry about this.\"</p><p>He'd obviously been listening to my internal dialogue again since he'd answered my mental thoughts. I was getting ready to answer when I looked up to see us pulling up to a private airport hangar. Stefan finally turned to look at me, a tentative smile on his face. He intertwined our fingers, opening the car door and pulled me out behind him. We walked quickly to the unmarked jet, climbing the steps to enter the plane. Quickly scanning the interior, I noticed it was equipped with six leather seats, a small seating area with a kitchenette and a room I assumed was the bathroom.</p><p>\"What about our luggage?\" I asked, my voice sounding loud after the quietness of our non-verbal mental conversation.</p><p>Stefan led me to the two seats in the back of the plane, his thumb rubbing against the top of my hand. His mouth spread into a thin-lipped smile as he removed his sunglasses with his free hand, placing them on his lap carelessly.</p><p>\"Adolfo can take care of it. It is the least he can do.\" Stefan's voice was severe and cold as he spoke of the vampire that had not yet entered the small plane.</p><p>I considered the tone of Stefan's voice for a moment. Something wasn't right with this whole situation. Stefan could see the futures of vampires, so why hadn't he foreseen Adolfo betraying him? Was this one of the black spots in his vision?</p><p>\"Possibly. It is something I am unaccustomed to encountering. There is another party involved that I cannot see or that continues to change their mind, vackra.\"</p><p>Adolfo entered the plane, removing his own sunglasses and walking slowly down the aisle to sit in the seat across the aisle from us. His arrogance from earlier in the morning was gone. He seemed almost regretful as he began to speak to us, his eyes downcast.</p><p>\"Stefan, I understand why you're angry with me. I didn't mean for this to happen when I was doing my research. One of the members of the Administrative Board found out and demanded you both appear. I had no choice in the matter,\" he said, his heavily accented voice broke off in apology. \"I'd rather not fly twenty plus hours to come here, then another twenty hours back to serve as your escort.\"</p><p>\"It is irrelevant at this point. I specifically asked you to be discreet, Adolfo. How is a member of the Administrative Board finding out about your inquiries being discreet?\" Stefan seethed, anger flashing across his face. His other hand was gripping the arm rest of the chair so tightly I could hear the metal groan in displeasure under the pressure of his grasp.</p><p>\"I have known you for three centuries, Stefan. The last thing I wanted to do is jeopardize our friendship,\" Adolfo replied, adjusting his suit jacket nervously and flashing me an apologetic smile.</p><p>Shaking my head, I snorted in response. It was a little too late to try to make friends with me, considering we were sitting on a plane because of his little slip-up and he was the cause of Stefan's highly agitated state. I was hoping we'd make it to appear before the Council without Stefan ripping Adolfo apart.</p><p>\"Consider it jeopardized, Adolfo. We will have plenty of time for you to atone for your mistake. Our friendship has met its end.\" Stefan's responding voice was severe and had an ominous quality to it. I instinctively knew that Adolfo's days were numbered from the double meaning of his words.</p><p>Their terse conversation was interrupted by the pilot's voice coming through the overhead speakers, advising us that we were cleared for take-off and to expect a brief stop in Tokyo to refuel.</p><p>Releasing Stefan's hand for a moment to buckle my seat belt, I reached back to lace my fingers with his again to prepare for take off. I gave him a shaky smile, sending him a heartfelt mental thought. \"I love you.\"</p><p>A radiant smile broke over his face. He was almost glowing as he leaned over to kiss me, his lips soft against mine. \"As I love you. Hearing you say those words makes all of this worthwhile.\"</p><p>As the plane began to taxi down the runway, I hoped that he still felt the same way when we returned.</p><p>Twenty hours later, we were landing at JFK in New York. The flight had been monotonous and tension filled. When I wasn't sleeping or having mental conversations with Stefan, I spent my time watching him alternate between glowering at Adolfo and pacing the length of the plane.</p><p>We stepped off the plane at another private hangar where a black sedan with tinted windows was idling, waiting for our arrival. Stefan led me to the car and opened the door for me, motioning for me to slide through so he could follow. He closed the door behind him, my hand firmly encased in his. I heard the trunk close and Adolfo got into the passenger seat.</p><p>\"You must be Josephine.\" A female voice greeted me in a crisp English accent. I glanced up to see a pair of large brown eyes staring back at me from the rear view mirror. Her hair was long and pale blond and her voice was pleasant and proper, reminding me of an English school marm.</p><p>Letting out a tired sigh, I nodded. Was there a vampire out there that didn't know me? I must be the top news in the vampire world. \"That's me. I guess everyone knows who I am.\"</p><p>\"I am Lenora. I'm also on the Council with Adolfo,\" she replied, her brown eyes shifting to look in Stefan's direction. \"Stefan, it's good to see you.\"</p><p>\"Lenora.\" Stefan inclined his head slightly. My grip on his hand tightened and I found myself sliding closer against him.</p><p>\"Do not turn your back on any of these vampires, Josephine. If you listen to nothing else I tell you, please remember to make sure I am with you and you are not alone with any of them.\"</p><p>Squeezing his hand to acknowledge his mental words, I took in the skyline of the city. It was all cement and noise, making me homesick for the green lushness of Bali. I hadn't been in the US for two years and all of the buildings and traffic were sensory overload for me.</p><p>We rode along in silence, pulling in front of a five-story Carriage house on the Upper East side of Manhattan. The heavy wooden garage doors opened, our car pulling inside of the building. I heard the garage doors close behind us and I felt the suffocating feeling of dread tighten in my throat.</p><p>As soon as the car stopped, Adolfo and Lenora were out of the car in a blur. Lenora opened the door on Stefan's side of the car and Stefan started to slide out, hesitating when he saw the look of panic on my face. \"Josephine, I will not let anything happen to you. I promise you.\"</p><p>My eyes darted to his, nodding slowly. I slid across the seat to step out of the car next to Stefan in the garage. He pulled me close to his side and we followed Lenora and Adolfo to an elevator where the doors were already open and waiting for us to enter. We all filed in and Lenora reached over to press a button on the panel. The doors closed and the elevator jerked and groaned as it began to ascend to a higher floor. After a moment, the elevator doors slowly opened and we were led into a spacious room with four leather sofas, glass tables and elegant chairs. Beautiful artwork lined the brick walls of the house and gorgeous floral arrangements sat in the middle of each table.</p><p>There were three vampires standing at the windows, their heads turning in perfect synchronization as we entered the room. Lenora and Adolfo went to stand with them, leaving Stefan and I standing on the other side of the room with five sets of critical eyes taking in our every move.</p><p>A beautiful vampire swept across the room to stand before us. Her waist length hair was a deep chestnut brown and her expressive black eyes swept over me curiously. Her eyes moved to Stefan, lingering on him much longer than I would prefer. She motioned with her hand for us to sit down on the sofa closest to us. Smiling curtly, she turned and walked back to slowly lower herself on the couch facing us. The other vampires took their seats, still silently observing us. Stefan led us to the couch, pulling me down beside of him. He was still holding my hand, his grip possessive and soothing.</p><p>\"Josephine, I am Sofia Mancini. You have already met Adolfo and Lenora,\" she addressed me, her voice soft with a thick Italian accent. She inclined her head towards the two other vampires. \"This is Derek Collier and Nigel Ryan. We are all on the Council and are very interested in meeting you. Let us sit and talk.\"</p><p>At the mention of Derek's name, Stefan's body stiffened slightly. Surprised at his reaction, I wondered if this was this the same Derek he'd spoken of when he returned from his last assignment.</p><p>I didn't have to speculate for long since the look on Derek's face said it all. The dark haired vampire might have been handsome if not for the arrogant sneer on his sullen face. His gray eyes burned with resentment as he glanced first at Stefan and then to me. He snickered when he observed our joined hands, releasing a bored sigh and crossing his arms under his chest.</p><p>My gaze turned to Nigel. He was ruggedly handsome and his shoulder length light brown hair was tousled. Expressive hazel eyes flickered over us, nodding slightly. He was a large muscular man, appearing to be uncomfortable sitting on the small leather sofa.</p><p>\"Hello?\" My greeting came out sounding like a question, my heart racing wildly. The Council of vampires continued to visually observe me as if I were an anomaly, their faces a mixture of curiosity, aggravation and envy.</p><p>\"Stefan, this is the woman from your visions? The one you have been searching for?\" Sofia questioned him, leaning towards him in interest. Her lips turned up in a tight smile as she shifted her attention on me, her dark eyes were hard and filled with dislike as she scrutinized me. I could feel a tingling sensation against my brain, as if she was making an attempt to push her way inside. She was obviously unsuccessful as she sat back deeper into the couch, glancing at Derek and her brows pulling together into an affronted frown. She glared at me, appearing to be furious that her ability didn't work on me. She must be the telepath Stefan had spoken of.</p><p>\"Yes,\" Stefan answered simply, turning slightly to look down at me, his handsome face serene. Our eyes met for a moment and a small smile touched his lips. \"This is my fated.\"</p><p>\"Josephine, how do you feel about Stefan? You know about what we are and you are not afraid?\" Nigel spoke up, his voice inflected with an Australian accent. His heavy hand rubbed his chin as he watched my reaction.</p><p>\"Tell him the truth, vackra.\"</p><p>Sitting up straight, I felt my jaw jut out in defiance. \"I know that you're vampires. I'm in love with him, even considering to have him change me so we can always be together. As for being afraid, I've been more scared in the last 24 hours than I've ever been since I've met him.\"</p><p>\"We apologize for our abrupt invitation. It was necessary to meet you.\" Nigel leaned forward with his forearms against his thighs. \"We need to assess if you are a risk and your abilities.\"</p><p>\"My risk? I love him,\" I snapped, looking around the room at each vampire. \"I have no intention of telling anyone anything about your existence.\"</p><p>Stefan squeezed my hand lightly. \"Josephine. I know you are angry. Do not let them provoke you.\"</p><p>Sighing, I squeezed his hand back. They were intentionally trying to make me angry. I needed to stay calm and answer their questions.</p><p>\"And why should we believe you?\" Derek asked coldly. His voice had a southern drawl that reminded me of Georgia. I didn't fail to miss the note of sarcasm in his voice. \"You are just a human after all.\"</p><p>\"You don't have to believe me. Here's the thing, Derek. I have no one to tell. My adoptive parents died four years ago and I have no living family. Prior to meeting Stefan, I lived a solitary life. I have my own issues, let alone causing problems for you.\" I was proud of how non-nonchalant I managed to sound, even though my stomach was twisting in knots with anxiety.</p><p>Derek eyed me for a moment, his gray eyes flat as stone. He looked towards Stefan and his eyes turned harder. A sinister smile broke across his face. \"Stefan, you know the risks of choosing to play with your food.\"</p><p>Derek's words caused a deep growl to resonate in Stefan's chest, his jaw clenching and the muscles in his neck were tense and corded.</p><p>\"Stefan, remember what you just told me. He's trying to piss you off. Let's get this over with so we can leave.\" I mentally implored him. He relaxed slightly before he spoke.</p><p>\"I do not consider loving someone 'playing with my food,' Derek. In case anyone in attendance has forgotten Derek's indiscretion, let me remind everyone why it was necessary for me to have a discussion with him a week ago,\" Stefan said, his voice devoid of any inflection as his eyes bored into him. Derek shifted uncomfortably under the weight of his severe stare. \"You threatened to expose our kind when humans started going missing after being seen in your presence. Your ignorance and arrogance could have exposed our existence. Yet you sit before me and have the audacity to warn me of 'playing with my food'? Inkompetent r?vh?l!\"</p><p>The room was silent for a moment and Stefan's words hung in the air. Derek rose and walked to the windows, turning his back to the room. To say there was no love lost between Stefan and Derek was an understatement.</p><p>\"She's a psychic like you, yet she also has a talent for reading emotions. Is she able to read you? Or any vampires?\" Lenora questioned, flipping her pale blond hair over her shoulder. She turned her head to the side slightly, as if evaluating my talent.</p><p>\"No, I can't read Stefan's future or emotions. Or any vampire,\" I jumped in to answer before Stefan could speak. The four vampires exchanged looks amongst each other.</p><p>\"I have one more question. Stefan, you contacted Adolfo with concerns about changes in Josephine's body and the power of her abilities. Is this still something you are concerned about?\" Nigel inquired. Out of this group of vampires, he had to be the most likeable and trustworthy.</p><p>Stefan nodded, running his free hand through his blond hair. \"Yes, it is still a concern. Her punctures heal within minutes of me biting her. I deduced that it may be a side-effect of our blood exchanges.\"</p><p>A hushed silence fell over the room. Disbelieving and curious looks were exchanged between the group.</p><p>\"You willingly offered your blood to her and she accepted? Most vampires would never willingly exchange blood with a human, unless if you were choosing to turn them,\" Sofia murmured in a mild, fascinated tone. She glanced between me and Stefan, then turned to look at Nigel.</p><p>\"I did. It sort of happened in the heat of the moment,\" I muttered hastily, averting my eyes to observe the pattern on the rug. I had no desire to explain the circumstance to anyone, let alone this group of vampires.</p><p>\"Stefan, Josephine. Please leave us for a few minutes so we can discuss the matter. We'll send for you when we're ready.\" Nigel waved his hand in dismissal.</p><p>Stefan inclined his head, leading me out of the large room. We walked down the hallway and entered a much smaller sitting room.</p><p>\"Come. We need to sit and wait.\" Stefan crossed the room and sat down on the couch, opening his arms for me to join him. There was nothing I needed more at that moment than to be close to him. I curled against him, my head tucked into the crook of his neck.</p><p>\"I needed this,\" I mumbled against his chest, snuggling closer to him.</p><p>\"It is going to be fine, Josephine. Please do not worry,\" Stefan whispered against my hair. I felt him place feather-light kisses where his lips had been.</p><p>\"I know. I just feel like this isn't over, Stefan,\" I murmured, leaning my head back to look at his face. He smiled down at me briefly before lowering his lips to mine. His kiss was gentle, slow and consuming. I could feel myself responding despite the situation we were in, my mouth hungry against his. He reluctantly lifted his lips from mine, chuckling lightly.</p><p>\"I want you as well, Josephine. Let us take care of this business here and we can spend some time alone.\"</p><p>\"We can stay here in New York for a day or two. Just the two of us.\" His mental words caused desire to burn deep in my stomach when I thought of the things we could do in a day or two. I hoped that our time in New York didn't include sightseeing.</p><p>I nodded, placing my head back on his shoulder. My body was close to exhaustion due to the stress of the situation, the 20 hour flight and the time change. I needed a bath, a nap and I just wanted to wrap myself around Stefan and forget about judgmental councils of vampires.</p><p>A knock on the door caused me to jump and Sofia peeked her dark head in the door. \"Please come back in.\"</p><p>She led us back into the main room, my eyes sweeping over the vampires again as I waited for their decision.</p><p>Nigel spoke, his voice level and filled with authority. \"We see no risk as to you being together. However, Josephine, we would like to ask for your assistance from time to time. You have the gift of seeing the futures of humans, which we cannot. From time to time we are faced with the problem of worrying about being exposed by humans. Your gift would be helpful on how to handle the human aspect of the issue.\"</p><p>\"I'll help. I just want to go home,\" I readily agreed. I just wanted to see the ocean and feel the sand beneath my feet. Not to mention I was growing tired of feeling like a t-bone steak in a room of starving people.</p><p>\"You both can go. Stefan, we'll be in touch,\" Nigel said, rising to signal the end of the meeting.</p><p>\"I need to find a bathroom, Stefan.\"</p><p>He nodded, and I followed him down a hallway to a spacious bathroom, decorated in expensive red glass tile. Heading to the sink I splashed water on my face, taking in my tired expression. My green eyes were bloodshot and my reddish-blond hair a tangle of waves. I ran my fingers through my hair to try to smooth it, but it seemed to make it worse. Patting my face with a fluffy hand towel, I opened the door to see Stefan waiting on the other side. A smile of relief broke over his face as I rejoined him.</p><p>\"Are you ready to leave?\" Stefan asked, his large hand smoothing down the side of my face tenderly.</p><p>\"Yes. Get me the hell out of here,\" I muttered. If I had the energy, I would have sprinted out of the building to escape. I settled on linking hands with Stefan and relying on the groaning elevator for my getaway.</p><p>We started down the hallway towards the elevator when a door opened, blocking our path. An otherworldly looking man stepped into the hall, his red hair shining under the bright overhead lights. His clear green eyes were large and almond shaped, his body compact and small boned. His very presence spoke of power and ageless strength. I could feel my mouth open and close as I tried to speak, feeling my heart racing out of control. Looking at this man was like looking into a mirror.</p><p>Stefan's arm wrapped possessively around my waist, holding me close to him.</p><p>\"Josephine, I have been waiting for this moment for 28 years. You are everything I expected and more.\" His voice was filled with depth and authority. He was well dressed in a dark suit and shirt and his skin was pale with the same iridescent quality I'd come to associate as a vampire characteristic. \"And Stefan Lifsten, you have found your mate. Wonderful!\"</p><p>Eying him with a calculating expression, I was curious as to the identity of the vampire that looked like me and acted as if he knew me. And why was he so happy that Stefan had met me? Speechless, I could only stare at him in disbelief.</p><p>\"Have we met before?\" Stefan's asked, his voice smooth and guarded.</p><p>The man let out a laugh that resonated throughout the entire floor. He stepped closer to me, his green eyes sparkling as his piercing eyes searched my face.</p><p>\"Stefan, you are always so pragmatic. I am Kian Ahearne. I am on the Administrative Board.\" He paused, a dry smile breaking across his face. \"I am who you've been searching for, Josephine. I am your biological father.\"</p><p>My mind slowly closed in on itself like a falling house of cards, effectively shutting down and refusing to accept any other information. My knees buckled and I was aware of the hardness of Stefan's arms catching me as I began to collapse to the floor. The last thing I recalled was seeing Stefan's face hovering above me, his face lined with worry before everything turned black. </p> </body></html>"]
