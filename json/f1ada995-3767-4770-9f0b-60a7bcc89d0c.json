And she knew that her husband, Roy, was too.</p><p>Who wouldn\u2019t be? Starting in July, Roy\u2014a private investigator\u2014had received a series of anonymous postcards, and while the messages weren\u2019t overtly threatening, they were certainly distressing.</p><p>The first communication, which had been mailed to the office, spoke of regrets. During the intervening weeks, there\u2019d been several others. Corrie had read each postcard so often she\u2019d memorized them all. The first one stated: EVERYONE HAS REGRETS. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU\u2019VE DONE YOU WISH YOU COULD DO OVER? THINK ABOUT IT. There hadn\u2019t been a signature then, or on any of the other cards. They\u2019d arrived at infrequent intervals and been mailed from different locations. The cryptic messages kept playing in her mind. The passing of time hadn\u2019t helped; she was as much in the dark now, in October, as when she\u2019d seen that first postcard.</p> <p>There was a final gasping, gurgling sound as the coffee drained into the glass pot. The noise distracted Corrie from her worries for a moment\u2014long enough to glance out the wide office window that overlooked downtown Cedar Cove, Washington. Serving as Roy\u2019s secretary and assistant had its advantages, and in this instance, disadvantages. Sometimes ignorance truly was bliss; the current situation was definitely one of those cases. She\u2019d sleep better if she\u2019d never learned about the mysterious postcards.</p><p>And yet...even if Roy had managed to keep them hidden from her, she would still have known\u2014because the last message had been hand-delivered, at night, to their front door. Not to the office like the others, but to their home. Late one evening, someone had walked up the sidewalk and onto the porch of their house. As it happened, Roy and Corrie were entertaining dinner guests that night\u2014and had opened the door to discover that an unknown person had left a fruit basket and an accompanying note. Chills raced up Corrie\u2019s spine at the thought that this person knew their home address.</p><p>\u201cIs that coffee ready yet?\u201d Roy called from inside his office. Apparently she hadn\u2019t delivered it fast enough.</p><p>\u201cHold your horses\u2014it\u2019s coming.\u201d Corrie didn\u2019t mean to snap at her husband. Normally she wasn\u2019t short-tempered. This uncharacteristic outburst revealed how upset she was by everything that was happening to them. Sighing, she filled a clean mug for Roy and carried it, steam rising, into his office.</p><p>\u201cOkay, that does it,\u201d she said, putting the coffee on the corner of his desk. \u201cWe have to talk.\u201d</p> <p>As if he didn\u2019t have a care in the world, Roy leaned back in his chair and locked his fingers behind his head. They\u2019d been married for twenty-seven years, and Corrie found him as attractive now as she had in college. Roy had played football for the University of Washington and been a \u201cbig man on campus,\u201d as they used to say. He was tall and broad-shouldered, still muscular, his posture as straight as ever. He stayed in good shape without apparent effort, and Corrie envied, just a bit, the fact that he\u2019d never gained any weight. His dark hair had thinned and was streaked with gray, which only added a look of dignity to his appearance.</p><p>Of all the women he dated during college, he\u2019d fallen in love with her. Theirs hadn\u2019t been an easy courtship, though. They\u2019d broken up for more than a year, and then reunited. Once they were back together, they realized how much they loved each other; there\u2019d been no uncertainty about their feelings. They were married shortly after graduation and their love had endured through trials and tribulations, through good years and bad. They\u2019d had plenty of both.</p><p>\u201cTalk about what?\u201d Roy asked casually.</p><p>His nonchalance didn\u2019t fool Corrie. Her husband knew exactly what was on her mind. \u201cDoes THE PAST HAS A WAY OF CATCHING UP WITH THE PRESENT tell you anything?\u201d she murmured, sitting down in the chair normally reserved for clients. She wanted Roy to understand that she wouldn\u2019t be put off easily. She was afraid he knew more about these postcards than he\u2019d let on. It would be just like him to try to protect her.</p><p>Roy frowned. \u201cThose messages don\u2019t have anything to do with you, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><p>His answer infuriated her. \u201cHow can you say that? Everything that happens to you affects me.\u201d</p> <p>He seemed about to argue, but after all these years, he recognized that she wasn\u2019t going to be satisfied with glib reassurances. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to tell you. I\u2019ve made enemies and, yes, I have regrets, but who doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Roy had reached the rank of detective for the Seattle Police Department and been forced into early retirement because of a back injury. In the beginning, Corrie had been excited to have her husband at home. She\u2019d hoped they\u2019d be able to travel and do some of the things they\u2019d always planned, but it hadn\u2019t worked out that way. Roy had the time now, but their finances had been adversely affected when he\u2019d had to take early retirement. Their income was less than it had been by at least twenty percent. In a money-saving effort, they\u2019d moved from Seattle and across Puget Sound to the community of Cedar Cove. The cost of property was much more reasonable in KitsapCounty, which also offered a slower pace of life. When the real estate agent showed them the house at 50 Harbor Street</p><p>, with its wide front porch and sweeping view of the cove and lighthouse, Corrie knew immediately that this house and this town would become their home.</p><p>They\u2019d moved from the big city, and it hadn\u2019t been as much of an adjustment as Corrie had feared. Folks in town were pleasant, and Roy and Corrie had made a few good friends\u2014notably the Beldons\u2014but kept mostly to themselves. They knew their neighbors\u2019 names and exchanged greetings, but that was about it.</p><p>To Corrie\u2019s disappointment, Roy had grown restless with retirement. His moods had reflected his boredom, and he was frequently cantankerous. Everything changed when he decided to rent office space and hang out his shingle as a private investigator. It was a decision Corrie had encouraged. Soon her husband was busy and looking forward to each day. He took on the cases that suited him and turned down those that didn\u2019t. Corrie was proud of Roy\u2019s skills, proud of his success and the way he cared about his clients. Never did it occur to her, or apparently to Roy, that one day he\u2019d be solving his own mystery.</p><p>\u201cYou could be in danger,\u201d Corrie murmured, letting her anxiety show. She refused to hide her feelings, refused to pretend all was well when it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Roy shrugged. \u201cI doubt I\u2019m in jeopardy. If anyone wanted to do me harm, they would\u2019ve done so before now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that?\u201d she asked irritably. \u201cBob was followed, and we both know it wasn\u2019t Bob they were interested in. He was driving your car. They thought they were following you.\u201d</p> <p>Bob Beldon, together with his wife, Peggy, was the owner of the local bed-and-breakfast, Thyme and Tide. Bob had borrowed Roy\u2019s car and phoned in a near panic, sure he was being followed. Roy had advised him to drive immediately to the sheriff\u2019s office. As soon as Bob had pulled in to the station, the tail had left him. Only later did Roy and Corrie figure it out. Whoever had shadowed Bob had assumed it was Roy driving.</p><p>\u201cThe letter said we\u2019re in no danger,\u201d her husband reminded her.</p><p>\u201cOf course! That\u2019s what they want us to think,\u201d Corrie argued. \u201cWhoever\u2019s doing this wants us to lower our guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Corrie\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off, rejecting any further attempts to pacify her. \u201cThat basket was delivered to our front porch. This...stranger walked right up to our home and left it, and now you\u2019re telling me we have nothing to worry about?\u201d Her voice quavered, and she realized how close she was to losing control of her emotions. She was tired of being afraid, tired of waiting for the next message\u2014or worse. Tired of waking up with her eyes burning from lack of sleep. Her first conscious thought every morning was fear of what might happen that day.</p><p>\u201cThe basket came over a week ago, and we\u2019ve heard nothing since.\u201d Roy said this as if this was supposed to comfort her. It didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThere was no postcard in the mail today, was there?\u201d he asked, and she heard an unmistakable hint of tension in his voice.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Corrie had collected the mail, flipped through it and tossed the bundle of bills and circulars on her desk.</p><p>Roy nodded, as if to say Well, then?</p><p>\u201cRoy,\u201d she said with deceptive calm, \u201cI can\u2019t remember the last time I slept a night straight through. You\u2019re not sleeping well, either.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t agree or disagree.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go on pretending everything\u2019s all right.\u201d</p><p>Roy\u2019s handsome features tightened. \u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can,\u201d he told her curtly.</p><p>\u201cI know, but it isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be.\u201d</p><p>Corrie wasn\u2019t an expert in the area of investigations, but she knew when it was time to seek help, and they were well past that point. \u201cYou need to talk to somebody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The only person she could suggest was the local sheriff. \u201cTroy Davis...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a good idea,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWhatever this is about happened long before we moved to Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRegrets. Every postcard mentions regrets. There isn\u2019t a cop who doesn\u2019t have regrets\u2014about things we\u2019ve done or haven\u2019t done or should\u2019ve done differently.\u201d</p><p>She thought\u2014but didn\u2019t say\u2014that every human being had regrets. It wasn\u2019t restricted to cops.</p><p>\u201cThe last message said I JUST WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID. DON\u2019T YOU HAVE A SINGLE REGRET? To me, that implies I did something\u2014arrested someone, testified against someone\u2014when I was a detective for Seattle.\u201d</p><p>Her voice fell to a whisper. \u201cYou were on the force a lot of years. Surely there\u2019s a case or two that stands out in your mind.\u201d</p><p>Roy shook his head. \u201cDo you think I haven\u2019t thought about that? You\u2019ve seen me read through my files and notes, going all the way back to my first year on the force, and there\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know...You haven\u2019t talked to me. You block me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m protecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d she cried with barely controlled anger. \u201cI need to know\u2014I have to know. Don\u2019t you see what this is doing to me?\u201d</p><p>Roy leaned forward then, bracing his elbows against the desk. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve wracked my brain and I can\u2019t think of anyone who\u2019d come after me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there must be some case...One you might\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d</p><p>Obviously at a loss, Roy shook his head again. \u201cClearly I have. I\u2019ve put murderers away and received my share of threats over the years, but I can\u2019t think of anyone who\u2019d do this. Yet who else could it be?\u201d he said, almost to himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d She was more in control now. Clutching a wadded tissue in her hand, she inhaled a calming breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe type of people I dealt with weren\u2019t subtle. If they wanted revenge, they wouldn\u2019t bother with postcards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA relative of some criminal you sent to jail? Or...a victim?\u201d That was a possibility she\u2019d entertained more than once.</p><p>He raised his shoulders in a slight shrug. \u201cCould be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we supposed to do now?\u201d It was this constantly being on guard, not knowing what to expect, that had driven Corrie to such an emotional extreme.</p> <p>\u201cWe do nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d This wasn\u2019t what she wanted to hear. \u201cHow can we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to, for now, until they make a mistake. That\u2019ll happen, sweetheart, I promise you, and once it does, this nightmare will be over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Roy\u2019s expression softened and he nodded. Offering her further reassurance, he extended his arm across the desk. Corrie reached for his hand and laced her fingers through his. Her husband gazed deep into her eyes. She felt his love, his comfort, and for now it was enough. For today, for this morning at least, she would be fine. Her problem, Corrie decided, was that she was just so tired. Everything would seem less frightening if she could get even one decent night\u2019s sleep.</p> <p>The front door to the office opened, and Roy abruptly released her and stood. From his years of police work he was always on the alert, never more so than now.</p><p>\u201cMom, Dad?\u201d Their daughter\u2019s voice rang from the outer office where Corrie\u2019s desk was situated.</p><p>\u201cLinnette,\u201d Corrie cried eagerly, although her enthusiasm might have seemed a little strained. \u201cWe\u2019re in here.\u201d</p><p>Their daughter came into the room, then paused, an uncertain expression on her face. She was petite like Corrie, with dark hair and eyes. Also like Corrie, Linnette had excelled in school, and because she was the daughter of a policeman, she\u2019d always been sheltered. Her studies had kept her from pursuing much of a social life, but Corrie hoped that would change now. Linnette had never had a serious boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interrupting anything, am I?\u201d Linnette glanced suspiciously from Corrie to Roy and back again. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Corrie assured her in a rush. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d</p> <p>Their daughter was far too intuitive to be easily fooled, but thankfully she let it pass. \u201cI\u2019ve found an apartment,\u201d Linnette announced and did a small jig around the office.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Corrie asked, hoping it was in town. Linnette had been hired by the new Cedar Cove Medical Clinic as a Physician\u2019s Assistant, and Corrie was thrilled to have her closer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on the cove, just down from the Waterfront Park,\u201d Linnette explained. \u201cThe complex next to the Holiday Inn Express.\u201d</p><p>Corrie knew the apartment building, since she passed it nearly every day when she went for her afternoon walk. The building was close to the marina and a short distance from the library. The two-story complex had a fabulous water view of the cove and lighthouse, with the Bremerton shipyard in the distance. As far as Corrie was concerned, this was perfect.</p><p>\u201cI hope they aren\u2019t charging you an arm and a leg,\u201d Roy cautioned, but Corrie could tell he was pleased.</p><p>\u201cThe rent, compared to what I was paying in Seattle, is a bargain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Roy was still protective of his little girl. Unfortunately, he had a difficult time expressing his feelings for his children\u2014especially their son. Mack and his father were constantly at odds. In Corrie\u2019s opinion, they were too much alike. Mack seemed to know exactly what to say to irritate Roy. And Roy wasn\u2019t blameless, either; he seemed to go out of his way to find fault with their son. Because of the tension between them, they generally avoided each other. Corrie didn\u2019t like it. Most of the time, she felt trapped in the middle. Thankfully that wasn\u2019t the case with Linnette, who was two years older than her brother.</p> <p>Linnette was talking about the apartment and the move-in date and her job at the clinic. Corrie nodded at the appropriate moments but only listened with half an ear. Roy returned to his work while Corrie walked back to her desk, Linnette following her.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Linnette said as soon as they were in the other room. She lowered her voice, and her face was thoughtful. Concerned. \u201cAre you sure everything\u2019s all right between you and Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! What makes you ask?\u201d</p><p>Her daughter hesitated. \u201cJust now, when I came into the office, it looked like you were ready to cry, and Dad...he\u2014his eyes were so...hard. I\u2019ve never seen him that intense. I didn\u2019t know what to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re imagining things,\u201d Corrie insisted.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. We\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d Her daughter could be obstinate, definitely a trait she\u2019d inherited from Roy. The last person Corrie intended to share her worries with was Linnette. Eventually, perhaps, once this was all settled, they could laugh about it over lunch. But for now, these postcards were no laughing matter.</p><p>\u201cYou dropped a piece of mail,\u201d Linnette said, gesturing toward the desk.</p><p>Corrie froze. \u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there was a postcard on the floor when I came in. I put it on your desk.\u201d</p><p>Roy must have heard because he came out of the other office. His eyes met Corrie\u2019s. \u201cGive it to me,\u201d he instructed.</p><p>A small protest rose from her throat as she walked over to retrieve the card. Carefully she turned it over and read the message before handing it to Roy.</p><p>It said in large block letters: ARE YOU THINKING YET?</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Linnette demanded. \u201cYou\u2019d better tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Two</p><p>Charlotte Jefferson Rhodes worked cheerfully in her kitchen, baking a large batch of cinnamon rolls, Ben\u2019s favorite. After nearly sixty years as Charlotte Jefferson, she had to think twice to remember that she and Ben were actually married. A woman her age didn\u2019t expect to find love this late in life. Like so much else in the past few years, romance had come as a very nice surprise.</p><p>\u201cIt sure smells good in there,\u201d Ben called out from the living room where he sat, feet propped up on the ottoman. The Bremerton morning newspaper was folded over as he completed the New York Times crossword puzzle. Charlotte was impressed by his skill with words and his wide general knowledge. She also liked his lack of arrogance\u2014he used a pencil to fill it in.</p><p>\u201cThe first batch will be out of the oven soon,\u201d she promised. She enjoyed baking, especially when there was someone who appreciated her homemade treats. Ben certainly did, but he preferred his cinnamon rolls without raisins. She liked the raisins and Jack, her rascal of a son-in-law, did too. The solution was easy enough; she simply split the batch in half.</p><p>Her husband of little more than a month was a handsome man, a Cesar Romero look alike and a few years younger than Charlotte. Their age difference of four years didn\u2019t bother him and it didn\u2019t bother her, either. Charlotte was a young seventy-seven. While still in her teens, she\u2019d married Clyde Jefferson; that was toward the end of the Second World War. Women married much younger back in those days, she reflected. Together Clyde and Charlotte had raised their children in Cedar Cove. Olivia, her daughter, was a family court judge and still lived here. Her son, Will, had moved to Atlanta.</p><p>Cedar Cove, where she\u2019d lived for most of her life, was situated on the Kitsap Peninsula across Puget Sound from Seattle, and it was a thriving community. With a population of little over seven thousand, the town was small enough to be friendly, but large enough to have its own medical facility.</p><p>The new Cedar Cove Medical Clinic was due to officially open in the middle of November. Charlotte beamed with pride, knowing that without her and Ben and her friends from the Senior Center, there wouldn\u2019t be a clinic.</p><p>Even Olivia, her own daughter, hadn\u2019t seen the need for one, since the hospital in Bremerton was less than half an hour away, and there were good doctors in town. All of that was true, but Charlotte felt Cedar Cove should have a more complete medical facility, where emergencies could be handled. Half an hour was a long time to wait if you were having a heart attack! It could make the difference between life and death. Ben had felt the same way, and the cause had bonded them, especially when they were arrested for their peaceful demonstration. That rankled even now, but nearly the entire town had showed up to support her, Ben and their comrades in court. Just remembering how her friends had gathered around them was enough to make Charlotte\u2019s eyes fill with tears.</p><p>But, she reminded herself, that was neither here nor there; the clinic had been built and the staff hired, including the McAfees\u2019 daughter, Linnette, a Physician\u2019s Assistant.</p><p>The phone rang, and Charlotte glanced at the kitchen clock, slightly annoyed that anyone would be phoning so early on a Saturday morning. To her astonishment, it was nearly ten.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it.\u201d As she reached for the telephone, she noticed that Harry, her black cat, was curled up in Ben\u2019s lap. Now this was progress. Harry was Charlotte\u2019s protector and he wasn\u2019t fond of visitors. It had taken him half of this first month to get accustomed to Ben\u2019s presence and that long again to have anything to do with him.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said cheerfully into the receiver. Clyde used to say that Charlotte was born in a good mood. She had a natural inclination toward happiness; while some looked at the world as a place of gloom and sadness, she saw the positive things in life, even though she, too, had experienced great sorrows.</p><p>\u201cIs my father there?\u201d a rather pleasant male voice asked. Then, as if to clarify the point, he added, \u201cBen Rhodes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Is this Stephen?\u201d</p><p>Her question was followed by an awkward laugh. \u201cNo, it\u2019s David. I\u2019m calling from California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, David,\u201d Charlotte said warmly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you weren\u2019t able to make it to our wedding. You were missed.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s youngest son seemed taken aback by her friendliness. \u201cI wish I could\u2019ve been there, but I\u2019m sure Dad explained that I got tied up with a work situation.\u201d</p><p>Ben hadn\u2019t said anything about either son\u2019s absence, and Charlotte hadn\u2019t pressured him with questions. She wasn\u2019t sure what kind of relationship Ben had with his children. He rarely mentioned them and avoided the topic whenever she brought it up. And yet this young man seemed so likable and polite.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much I\u2019m looking forward to meeting you, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m eager to meet you, too, Charlotte. My father\u2019s a sly old fox. First he moves to Cedar Cove, when he could just as well have moved closer to either Stephen or me, and then he marries again. I don\u2019t mind telling you that was a real surprise for the family. A most delightful surprise, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was thrilled when your father came into my life,\u201d Charlotte said, charmed by David Rhodes. When neither David nor Stephen made it to the wedding, she feared there must be some problem between Ben and his sons\u2014a fear reinforced by Ben\u2019s apparent unwillingness to talk about them. Maybe there was no problem, after all. David certainly appeared to be an agreeable young man. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs my father there?\u201d he asked again.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.

David had been gracious and warm in his manner and given no hint of any tension in the family.</p> <p>Returning to the kitchen, Charlotte couldn\u2019t help overhearing Ben once he\u2019d picked up the phone. She didn\u2019t mean to pry, but she did admit to being curious.</p><p>\u201cHello, David,\u201d Ben said coolly.</p><p>It sounded as if Ben and his son were estranged, and that saddened her. She wondered what had happened. A misunderstanding? A long-held grudge? Or simply years of insufficient contact? And why wouldn\u2019t Ben tell her? After his less-than-enthusiastic greeting, he was silent for some time. Unfortunately Charlotte was privy to only one side of the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI believe we\u2019ve already gone over this a number of times. The answer is no, so please don\u2019t ask again.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s words were followed by another lengthy pause.</p> <p>Charlotte joined Ben and slipped her arm around him, offering her love and support. Her husband should be grateful David had phoned and that he and Charlotte had now had a chance to meet, even if it was only by phone. The last people Charlotte had expected to disapprove of their marriage had been their children. In fact, Olivia\u2019s objection to her remarriage had caused the first major rift in their relationship. Olivia\u2019s lack of faith had hurt Charlotte deeply. Ben\u2019s son, however, didn\u2019t seem to have any opposition to her marrying his father.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check,\u201d Ben said. He held the receiver against his shoulder. \u201cDavid will be in Seattle on business early next month and he wants to know if we can join him for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte smiled. \u201cTell him I\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>Ben frowned again, as if he wasn\u2019t sure what to say as he brought the receiver back to his ear. \u201cIt appears we can make it,\u201d he said in lackluster tones.</p><p>Charlotte resisted the urge to poke him in the ribs with her elbow. This was no way to act! Despite their apparent falling out, David was making an effort; the least Ben could do was meet him halfway.</p><p>Ben reached for the pencil dangling from a string by the calendar and wrote down the date and time. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk onto the Bremerton ferry,\u201d he told his son, \u201cand take a taxi to the restaurant. We\u2019ll meet you there at seven.\u201d With no further conversation, Ben replaced the receiver.</p> <p>He turned back to her. \u201cAs you might\u2019ve guessed, my son and I have had our share of differences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seems like such a nice young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can be,\u201d Ben murmured, his face impassive, difficult to read. \u201cEspecially when he wants something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Perhaps David had more than one reason for getting in touch with his father. \u201cDid you find out what he wants, then?\u201d she asked tentatively. She wouldn\u2019t ask too insistently. But Ben was closing himself off from her and Charlotte found that troublesome.</p><p>Ben shook his head. \u201cI generally don\u2019t ask David a lot of questions,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t question him when he left his wife of one year for his secretary\u2014and abandoned his infant daughter. That second marriage didn\u2019t last long, either.\u201d He paused. \u201cFrankly, David is a disappointment to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say it, but her own son was a disappointment to her, too. Olivia had never said a word, nor had Olivia\u2019s best friend, Grace Sherman. But Charlotte had caught wind of what Will had done from something Justine, her granddaughter, had mentioned. It had been a casual, offhand remark about how Grace was trying to patch up her romance with Cliff after her Internet relationship with Will. Apparently this wasn\u2019t the first time, either\u2014at least for Will. Georgia, his wife, had hinted that Will had a problem with fidelity. Charlotte didn\u2019t know whether he\u2019d had actual affairs or they were all e-mail relationships. She had no idea what had happened in her son\u2019s life to explain his behavior. Clyde would roll over in his grave if he learned of the careless way their son was treating his marriage vows.</p><p>\u201cI wish now I\u2019d said we couldn\u2019t make it,\u201d Ben muttered.</p> <p>\u201cBut we can. I want to meet your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a self-centered young man. Well, not that young anymore. He\u2019s over forty now. I suppose I\u2019m to blame for his selfishness. Joan spoiled them both while they were growing up. I was so preoccupied with my Navy career and gone so much of the time that I didn\u2019t realize until it was too late. Unfortunately both my sons lack discipline and self-control. When I recognized what they\u2019d become, they were already adults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have a perfectly lovely dinner,\u201d she said in a soothing voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Ben countered sadly. \u201cBut we\u2019ve made the commitment, so we\u2019ll do as David wishes and go into Seattle. I want you to meet my children, but it\u2019s important that you know in advance the kind of men they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy children have disappointed me at times, too,\u201d Charlotte confessed. She\u2019d been mortified to learn that at one point her own daughter had hired Roy McAfee to investigate Ben\u2019s background.</p><p>Ben stared blankly out the window. When he spoke, his voice was low and thoughtful. \u201cSometimes I feel as if my sons begrudge me any happiness. I think they believe I\u2019d be more use to them dead.\u201d At Charlotte\u2019s gasp, he added, \u201cIf I know David, and I do, he\u2019s counting on his inheritance to get him out of another financial mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Ben, you should\u2019ve told him...\u201d Before their marriage, Ben and Charlotte had adjusted their wills. They\u2019d left the majority of their estates to each other. Ben had left one-third of the remainder to each of his sons, and the last third to charity.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important that we attend this dinner with a positive attitude,\u201d Charlotte warned.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Ben sighed heavily and then hugged her.</p><p>\u201cEverything will work out just fine,\u201d she whispered. She had a good feeling about meeting David. She wanted to be a peacemaker in the family, to bring Ben and his sons together, and hoped that David would eventually grow to love her.</p><p>The timer on the oven buzzed and Ben lifted his head. \u201cDoes that mean what I think it does?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as these cinnamon buns cool down, I\u2019ll frost them and give you a small sample.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA small sample?\u201d he protested.</p><p>Charlotte raised her eyebrows. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to ruin your lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he promised. Ben sounded like a youngster, pleading with her.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think you married me because of my baking,\u201d Charlotte said, smiling to show she didn\u2019t mean it.</p><p>The laughter fled from his eyes as he gazed down at her. \u201cThen you\u2019d be wrong, Charlotte. I married you because I\u2019ve never loved a woman as much as I love you.\u201d</p><p>Three</p><p>Cecilia Randall arrived at Smith, Cox and Jefferson Accounting ten minutes early on Monday morning. She was just as glad to get to work. Being home by herself, without her husband, was lonely, despite her friends. The weekends were the worst, especially now that she was pregnant. Ian, her Navy husband, was out to sea on the aircraft carrier USS George Washington. Despite her reassurances, Ian worried about her\u2014with reason, as he pointed out. Everything in their current situation was exactly the same as it had been with Allison, their first child. And Allison had been born with a defective heart.</p><p>Ian hadn\u2019t been with Cecilia when Allison was born. Nor had he been there when Cecilia buried their infant daughter. Standing alone at the tiny grave site had nearly destroyed her and subsequently their marriage. If not for the wisdom of a family court judge who\u2019d denied their divorce on a technicality, they wouldn\u2019t be together now.</p><p>Pressing her hand against her stomach, Cecilia sent her unborn daughter thoughts of love and reassurance. It would be different this time, with this baby. But everything had seemed normal with Allison, too. Cecilia quickly flung aside the doubts that pummeled her. Ian had enough of those for both of them.</p><p>Cecilia was five months along now and happier than she could remember being in a long time. She desperately wanted this baby. If it had been up to Ian, they wouldn\u2019t ever have children again. He was afraid. Cecilia was, too, but her desire for a family had prevailed over her fears.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d Zachary Cox, her boss, said absently. He sorted through his mail as he walked past her desk, which was located outside his office.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she returned.</p><p>\u201cAllison will be in this afternoon,\u201d he said, looking up from the mail long enough to catch Cecilia\u2019s eye. \u201cShe\u2019s trying to earn money for a car. Her mother and I told her we\u2019d match whatever she managed to save. I\u2019m hoping there\u2019s enough to do around here to keep her occupied for the next few months.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia nodded, excited about seeing Mr. Cox\u2019s teenage daughter again. Cecilia had been hired while Mr. and Mrs. Cox were going through a divorce. The same judge who\u2019d denied her and Ian\u2019s divorce had made the joint custody decision in their case. Judge Olivia Lockhart had stated that the children and not the adults were the ones who needed a stable life. Instead of shuffling between residences, the kids, Allison and Eddie, were to remain in the family home and the Coxes would alternate, moving in and out every few days. It had worked well\u2014better than expected\u2014and before long Zach and Rosie Cox were back together.</p><p>Soon after Cecilia had begun working for Mr. Cox, he\u2019d started bringing in his troubled teenage daughter. The after-school job was an effort to keep an eye on the rebellious fifteen-year-old and to limit her exposure to a group of out-of-control friends she\u2019d recently taken up with. Despite all that, Cecilia was almost immediately drawn to her. The fact that Allison shared the same name as her own daughter had cemented their bond.</p><p>They\u2019d quickly become friends and Allison often confided in her or asked for advice. Cecilia had watched her blossom from an irrational, angry girl into a lovely young woman of seventeen. The contrast between then and now was striking. Cecilia sometimes fantasized that this was how her own daughter would\u2019ve looked and acted at this age had she lived.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to keep her busy,\u201d Cecilia assured her boss. There were always a number of small tasks she didn\u2019t get to by the end of the day, and this would help her catch up before she took her maternity leave.</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Mr. Cox entered his office, still perusing his mail. \u201cThanks, Cecilia.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia was busy all morning with only a short break\u2014a telephone conversation with her best friend, Cathy Lackey, whose husband was aboard the George Washington with Ian. The two of them had formed their own support group and relied on each other when their husbands were out at sea. Rarely a day passed that they weren\u2019t in touch with each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At three that afternoon, Allison Cox showed up at the office, just missing her father, who\u2019d left to meet with a client. Allison was willowy and classic-featured, a lovely girl. She wore her dark-brown hair long, all the way to the middle of her back. As she removed her gray wool coat, Cecilia saw that she\u2019d dressed for the office in a green plaid skirt and white turtleneck sweater. When Cecilia had first met her, Allison\u2019s favorite color was black. The girl had rebelled against the destruction of her family and lashed out at those around her. Cecilia liked to think that their friendship had helped Allison. In reality, she supposed, it was her parents\u2019 reconciliation that had changed the girl\u2019s outlook on life. Still Cecilia liked to think she\u2019d been a good influence, and Mr. Cox had frequently made a point of telling her she had.</p><p>That was two years ago, and Allison was now a high school senior.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you,\u201d Allison said, hugging Cecilia, although it\u2019d been less than a month since they\u2019d spent time together. \u201cHow\u2019s our baby doing?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia pressed her hand to her stomach. \u201cShe\u2019s kicking. Want to feel?\u201d</p> <p>Allison\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia held the girl\u2019s hand over her stomach and watched as Allison stared intently, bit her lower lip and then after a long moment, dejectedly shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t feel anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be a little early yet,\u201d Cecilia murmured, trying to remember how far along she\u2019d been with the last pregnancy before Ian could feel their daughter\u2019s movements.</p><p>Disappointed, Allison dropped her hand. \u201cWell, I guess I\u2019d better get to work.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia set her up at a vacant desk across from her own. During tax season, when the accounting firm hired extra help, every square inch of space was used by temporary employees. It got fairly chaotic from January through April of every year.</p> <p>Allison had been working for an hour when Mary Lou, who staffed the front desk, hurried into their work area. \u201cThere\u2019s a young man asking to see you,\u201d Mary Lou said to Allison. She cast a doubtful look at Cecilia as if to say she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d done the right thing.</p><p>\u201cDid he give you his name?\u201d Allison asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but he said you\u2019d know who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he wearing?\u201d</p><p>Mary Lou edged closer and lowered her voice. \u201cHe has a goatee and has on a long black coat that\u2019s got chains attached. He\u2019s wearing a big cross, too. I don\u2019t mind telling you, he looks a bit scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Anson.\u201d Allison stood and went out to the front. She was gone for ten minutes and was clearly pleased\u2014no, downright jubilant\u2014when she returned.</p> <p>Cecilia was more than a little curious. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d she asked. Without being obvious, she\u2019d managed to get a glimpse of this Anson character through one of the office windows. Cecilia understood Mary Lou\u2019s concerns. The boy\u2019s hair was long, greasy and dark. His overcoat fanned out from his sides, as though he had weapons concealed beneath it. Presumably he didn\u2019t, but still...He wasn\u2019t the type of boy Cecilia expected Allison to be interested in.</p><p>\u201cI barely know him,\u201d Allison claimed. \u201cHe\u2019s in my French class and he sits beside me. We\u2019ve talked a couple of times and that\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he know you were here?\u201d</p><p>Allison shrugged. \u201cOne of my friends must\u2019ve told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say what he wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. He asked about our French assignment.\u201d She grinned shyly and glanced down at the floor. \u201cThat was just an excuse, though, \u2019cause then he asked what I was doing tonight.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia nodded, a little worried about the girl\u2019s attraction to this self-styled rebel.</p><p>\u201cHe lives with his mother,\u201d Allison added.</p> <p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they get along very well,\u201d she said thoughtfully.</p><p>Cecilia didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cWould you go out with him if he asked?\u201d she murmured. Whether Allison admitted it or not, she was attracted to the boy. Everything about her said so.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s irrelevant. Anson hasn\u2019t asked and I doubt that he will. Guys like Anson don\u2019t go out. They hang out.\u201d</p><p>It was obvious that Mr. Cox hadn\u2019t met the young man, and Cecilia could only imagine how he\u2019d react if he found his daughter with Anson.</p><p>\u201cBe careful,\u201d Cecilia warned softly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad boys can be attractive, which translates into dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Allison smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Like I said, we hardly know each other.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia didn\u2019t mean to doubt her, but there was trouble coming; she could feel it. Cecilia just hoped Allison knew what she was doing.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have time to think about Allison after she left work because she was meeting Cathy and her three-year-old son, Andy. Cecilia drove straight to her friend\u2019s house without stopping at home. The two of them were putting together Christmas packages to mail off to Ian and Cathy\u2019s husband, Andrew. Cecilia had already filled the trunk of her car with Ian\u2019s gifts. She looked forward to the evening and to the take-out Chinese dinner she and Cathy planned to order.</p><p>\u201cDid you get an e-mail from Ian this morning?\u201d Cathy asked.</p><p>Cecilia shook her head. \u201cMaybe there\u2019ll be one at home.\u201d Ian never talked about what he did for the Navy. His job had something to do with guided missile systems and involved computers and other advanced technology. Ian couldn\u2019t discuss the details of his Navy life for reasons of national security, and Cecilia accepted that. She didn\u2019t care what the United States Navy had him do, as long as her husband arrived home safe and sound. Currently the George Washington was somewhere in the Persian Gulf, but exactly where was a mystery.</p><p>Ian e-mailed her at least once a day. He didn\u2019t have time to send long messages, but even a short note raised Cecilia\u2019s spirits. He insisted that he needed to hear from her, too, and just as often.</p><p>Because Cathy was a stay-at-home mom, she\u2019d picked up the necessary mailing supplies. While Andy sat on the floor and played with puzzles, the two women packaged their various gifts.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe what\u2019s in here,\u201d Cathy said, holding up a small jewelry-sized box.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sending Andrew a ring?\u201d Cecilia asked, puzzled.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s a sheer black nightgown\u2014with the promise that I\u2019ll wear it for him when he gets home.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia giggled. \u201cThat\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment,\u201d she said, remembering that she herself had done something similar once...</p><p>Cathy laughed, too. \u201cI doubt Andrew will think of it that way. I\u2019m ready for a second child. As far as I\u2019m concerned, little Andy needs a baby sister.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia managed to smile but quickly looked away and resumed her wrapping. Her life would be so different if Allison had lived. There were no guarantees that the heart ailment that had killed their daughter wouldn\u2019t afflict this second baby. Cecilia prayed with everything in her that the child she carried now would be healthy.</p><p>Four</p><p>Maryellen Bowman arrived home from her job at the Harbor Street Art Gallery and smiled when Jon stepped outside to greet her. She felt a sense of deep contentment at the sight of her husband. From her car seat behind Maryellen, two-year-old Katie let out a squeal of delight the instant she saw her father. She started kicking and swinging her arms, eager to escape the confines of the protective seat.</p><p>\u201cI know, honey, I know.\u201d Maryellen laughed. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see your daddy, too.\u201d</p><p>By the time Maryellen had parked, Jon was waiting by the car. He opened the back door and freed Katie, who immediately squirmed and wanted down. Now that she was walking, she was impossible to restrain. Still holding Katie, Jon walked around the front of the car to hug Maryellen.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home,\u201d he said and kissed her hungrily. He wove his free hand into her dark hair and brought his mouth to hers.</p><p>Between them, their daughter chattered insistently, seeking attention. Katie didn\u2019t take kindly to being ignored. Maryellen, however, barely noticed her objections.</p><p>\u201cYou make it worth coming home,\u201d she whispered, sighing with her eyes closed. Her husband could win a kissing contest\u2014not that she\u2019d let him enter even if there was such an event.</p><p>His arm around her waist, Jon led her into the home he\u2019d built with his own two hands. The property, with its view of the Seattle skyline across Puget Sound, had been an inheritance from his grandfather, and Jon had devoted countless hours to landscaping the grounds. The house was everything Maryellen could possibly want. It had spacious rooms, high ceilings, fireplaces and balconies, and a wide oak staircase to the second floor. A sweeping panorama of the water and the city lights beyond was available from every room. Her artist husband had designed and then painstakingly built the place, at the same time he was making his mark as a professional photographer. Maryellen loved her husband heart and soul, reveling in his many talents.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got dinner started,\u201d Jon told her as she stepped inside the house and was met by the scent of roasting chicken. On top of everything else, Jon was a gifted chef. Maryellen had to pinch herself every day, marveling that she was loved by such an extraordinary man.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d he asked, as Maryellen hung up her coat and tended to Katie.</p><p>\u201cBusy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you were home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know\u2014I\u2019d like to be here, too.\u201d The money Jon earned from his photographs was impressive but not yet sufficient for all their financial needs. Then there was the question of medical insurance, which was currently provided through her employer. They\u2019d already made one giant leap of faith when Jon left his job as chef for The Lighthouse restaurant earlier in the year. Maryellen had managed the Cedar Cove Art Gallery for the past ten years and the owners had come to rely on her. She hoped to train her assistant, Lois Habbersmith, to assume her role, but, so far, that hadn\u2019t worked out as well as she\u2019d hoped. Lois was a good employee but she didn\u2019t want the responsibility of being manager. Only after several months had she finally admitted that to Maryellen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to leave by the end of next year,\u201d Maryellen said as she reached for the mail, which Jon had placed on the kitchen counter.</p><p>\u201cNext year?\u201d Jon yelped.</p><p>\u201cI know, I\u2019m disappointed, too, but the time will go fast. It\u2019s already autumn.\u201d Her fingers stilled as she came across the envelope addressed to Mr. and Mrs. Jon Bowman. One glance at the return address told her the letter was from Jon\u2019s father and stepmother in Oregon. It remained unopened.</p><p>When Maryellen looked up, she found her husband watching her, almost as if he\u2019d anticipated her reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s from your family,\u201d she said unnecessarily.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t open it.\u201d This, too, was obvious.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, his voice devoid of emotion. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t. If it\u2019d been strictly up to me I would\u2019ve tossed it in the garbage. But your name\u2019s on it, too.\u201d Anger burned in his eyes. Years earlier, his parents had betrayed Jon and lied in order to save their younger son, Jon\u2019s half brother, from a prison sentence. In saving Jim, they\u2019d sacrificed Jon. While Jon, innocent of all charges, served seven years in prison, his younger brother continued to abuse drugs and eventually died of an overdose. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After he was released from prison, Jon had supported himself by working as a short-order cook. When he wasn\u2019t working, he was taking landscape photographs, which began to receive good reviews and significant interest from buyers. Among other places, his work was displayed in the Harbor Street Art Gallery, where he met Maryellen. Their courtship was long and tempestuous, and only after Katie was born did they marry.</p><p>At the time of her daughter\u2019s birth, Maryellen was convinced she didn\u2019t need or want a husband. She\u2019d married young and unwisely while in college, and it had been a disaster. When she discovered she was pregnant with Katie, she was determined to manage on her own. Other women were single mothers; she could do it, too. She\u2019d quickly learned how wrong she was. Katie wanted her daddy, and Maryellen soon realized she needed Jon in their lives. After their marriage, they were blissfully happy for a short time. Then Maryellen had stumbled upon a stack of unopened letters from Jon\u2019s parents.</p><p>Although she knew Jon would disapprove, she\u2019d secretly contacted the Bowmans and mailed pictures of Katie. As Katie\u2019s grandparents, Maryellen felt they had a right to know about their only grandchild. Her letter, unfortunately, had heightened their efforts to make peace with their son, which had only infuriated him. Jon refused to have anything to do with them. And he saw her actions, in contacting them, as another betrayal. He\u2019d been enraged with her. Her duplicity and his stubborn unwillingness to forgive had almost ruined their marriage.</p><p>At the time, Maryellen had just learned she was pregnant. She hadn\u2019t told Jon. How could she, when he shut her out\u2014no matter what she said or did? Having failed at one marriage, she believed her actions had killed his love for her and that her second marriage was doomed, too. It was then, at the lowest point of her pain and loss, that she miscarried her baby.</p> <p>That had been six weeks earlier. Six weeks during which they\u2019d carefully avoided the subject of Jon\u2019s parents. Together they grieved over the loss of this pregnancy and clung to each other, but their ability to trust was still shaky.</p><p>Maryellen studied the envelope. Jon hadn\u2019t immediately thrown the letter away, or hidden it, as he had previous ones. That was progress, she supposed. Over the intervening weeks, they\u2019d had numerous talks on forgiveness, and she felt he was finally willing to listen. This letter would be the proving ground.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you like me to do with it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Jon buried his hands in his pockets and gazed up at the ceiling. \u201cYou don\u2019t want the answer to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d she told him calmly.</p> <p>\u201cBurn it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d hoped and prayed that he\u2019d conquered some of his bitterness. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t burn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he admitted reluctantly.</p><p>Maryellen noticed that he stood about as far away from her as he could and still be heard. \u201cWhy not? I need never have known about this letter. Even if my name is on it.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but it was a defeated sound. \u201cYou\u2019d know. I\u2019m incapable of keeping anything from you.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen moved from behind the kitchen counter and tentatively stepped closer to her husband. \u201cJon?\u201d she asked again, keeping her voice gentle. \u201cTell me what I should do with the letter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She paused. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I\u2019m such a disappointment to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever that,\u201d she whispered. Maryellen wrapped her arms around his waist and lowered her head to his chest. Words weren\u2019t necessary to convey her love and her pride. He was her world, her life, and nothing, not even his relationship with his family, was worth risking the heaven she\u2019d found in him.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Jon to slide his arms around her. The tightness of his embrace told Maryellen what she already knew\u2014that he didn\u2019t want to risk losing her, either. After several moments of holding each other, Jon exhaled a long, deep breath.</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and read it. I know that\u2019s what you want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t tell me what it says.\u201d</p> <p>His response bothered her, but she wouldn\u2019t rush him. That was the mistake she\u2019d made earlier.</p><p>When Katie toddled past on her way to the kitchen, Maryellen left Jon to swoop her daughter into her arms. She set Katie in her high chair and handed her a graham cracker, then reached for the letter.</p><p>Jon turned away as if he couldn\u2019t bear to see Maryellen tear open the envelope.</p><p>The letter was brief. Jon\u2019s father had suffered a stroke. Fortunately, he\u2019d received medical attention in time, so there was no permanent damage. Jon\u2019s stepmother felt Maryellen would want to know and perhaps she could mention it to Jon.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about your father,\u201d she said, laying down the letter.</p><p>Jon bristled. \u201cI told you I don\u2019t want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he\u2019s had a stroke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryellen, how many times do I have to say it? I don\u2019t care. He\u2019s out of my life. As far as I\u2019m concerned, he\u2019s dead. That man gave up the right to be my father the day he lied on the witness stand and sent me to hell for seven years.\u201d</p><p>Katie set the cracker down in her tray and stared wide-eyed at her father.</p><p>\u201cYou talk about forgiveness, and that\u2019s real easy for you. You weren\u2019t the one in that rat hole. You weren\u2019t the one who had to endure it.\u201d His voice grew harsher with each word until Katie started to cry.</p><p>Jon\u2019s shoulders slumped forward and he hurried to his daughter, lifting Katie from the high chair and cradling her in his arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart,\u201d he cooed. \u201cDaddy didn\u2019t mean to shout.\u201d</p><p>Dinner was uncomfortable, but Maryellen made an effort and so did Jon. After Katie\u2019s bath, Maryellen rocked her and read a bedtime story before settling her in the crib. Once there, Katie put her thumb in her mouth and promptly went to sleep.</p><p>Jon had the television on when Maryellen walked down the stairs and joined him. She sat beside her husband on the sofa and rested her head on his shoulder. As if he felt the need to have her close, he draped his arm around her and nuzzled her neck.</p><p>Maryellen smiled contentedly. Since the miscarriage, their love life had been on hold while her body healed. Letting him know she wanted him, Maryellen slipped her hand around his neck and turned so their mouths could meet. Jon\u2019s hand found its way under her sweater to cup her breast. Her nipples instantly hardened and a sigh rumbled through him.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re up to this?\u201d he asked, between deep breathless kisses.</p><p>\u201cYou certainly are.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her bad pun even as he kissed her.</p><p>Taking him by the hand, Maryellen led her husband up the stairway to their bedroom.</p><p>Their lovemaking was fierce, urgent, powerful. While they held each other in the aftermath, Maryellen ran her hand down Jon\u2019s back. Nothing was worth disrupting the intimacy and love they shared. She hoped that eventually Jon would be able to reconnect with his parents, but she wouldn\u2019t force him into something he wasn\u2019t willing to do.</p><p>They released each other, and her husband lay beside her, supporting his weight on one elbow as he brushed the hair from her damp face. He kissed her again, his touch tender with his love.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is he?\u201d he asked, his voice husky in the darkness. He was referring to his father.</p><p>The question pleased Maryellen. \u201cThere\u2019s no permanent damage.\u201d</p><p>Jon sighed audibly. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Perhaps he\u2019d come farther than she realized.</p><p>Five</p><p>Linnette McAfee stood in the middle of her empty apartment, surveying her new home. The view of the cove was spectacular, with the lighthouse far in the distance. The Bremerton shipyard lay directly across the water, its massive ships glowing in the afternoon sunlight, battleship-gray against an azure sky. Living in a small town would be an adjustment, and yet, her parents had made the transition easily enough. Linnette had every reason to believe she would, too.</p><p>\u201cAnyone home?\u201d There was a knock at the open door, and her mother stepped inside.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw your car parked outside and decided to see if you were here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know which apartment was mine?\u201d</p><p>Corrie grinned. \u201cI haven\u2019t been married to your father all these years without developing a few detective skills of my own.\u201d She walked farther into the room. \u201cThe door was open and I took a chance.\u201d</p><p>Linnette spread her arms. \u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d she asked, pleased with her new apartment. She\u2019d lived on campus while attending the University of Washington and then later shared an apartment with a friend while she did her advanced studies.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d Corrie said, moving into the kitchen. The area was compact but well-designed and convenient.</p><p>\u201cI like that it has two bedrooms,\u201d Linnette said, eagerly leading her mother down the hallway to the empty rooms. Both bedrooms were larger than the one she had in Seattle. With this new apartment, Linnette was getting double the space for half the rent. Of course, her salary wasn\u2019t nearly as high as what she would\u2019ve earned had she accepted a job in Seattle. But staying in Seattle had never been her intention. From the moment she\u2019d made the decision to become a Physician\u2019s Assistant, Linnette had set her sights on working in a small rural community.</p><p>That description didn\u2019t exactly fit Cedar Cove, but the town was lovely and it was familiar\u2014and she\u2019d have the advantage of being near her parents. Which was definitely a bonus, since Linnette had always been close to them.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking I\u2019d set up this bedroom as an office,\u201d Linnette explained as they stood in the doorway of the second and smaller bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you officially moving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first of the month. Mack\u2019s going to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad will, too,\u201d Corrie offered. \u201cAnd of course I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><p>Linnette shook her head. \u201cDad\u2019s not helping, not with his back. Besides, you know as well as I do that it\u2019s best to keep Mack as far away from Dad as possible.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes grew sad. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is with those two.\u201d</p><p>Linnette rolled her eyes. \u201cI do. They\u2019re both stubborn and opinionated and too much alike for their own good.\u201d</p><p>Corrie agreed. \u201cMack makes an effort on holidays, but it\u2019s hard for him to hold his tongue.\u201d</p><p>The problem, in Linnette\u2019s opinion, was that her father disapproved of Mack. Her brother had dropped out of college and worked as a postal employee, a job he seemed to enjoy. Roy thought that with his brains and background, Mack could do better. His attitude infuriated her brother. Although she kept out of the fray, Linnette sided with Mack. This was his life and he should do as he pleased.</p><p>\u201cOne of these days,\u201d she said briskly, \u201cwe should lock them in a closet and force them to settle this, once and for all.\u201d</p><p>Her mother shook her head. \u201cI absolutely refuse to get involved. I hate being caught in the middle.\u201d</p><p>Linnette felt the same. She led the way back to the living room, considering where to hang her few pictures and framed posters as she walked. Pride of place would go to a beautiful Jon Bowman photograph her parents had given her for Christmas last year\u2014fir trees on a mountainside. The perspective made it much more than simply a pretty picture. Should she hang it between the two windows or\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you contacted Cal Washburn yet?\u201d her mother asked, interrupting her deliberations.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe young man I bought for you at the Dog and Bachelor Auction last July. You know, the fund-raiser for the animal shelter.\u201d</p><p>An immediate protest rose as Linnette struggled to tell her mother that she wasn\u2019t interested in a blind date with a stranger. Okay, so her brother loved his dog, who\u2019d come as part of the package. Cal and the Australian Shepherd Mack had named Lucky were on the auction block together. But that didn\u2019t mean Linnette was going to hit it off with this bachelor.</p> <p>\u201cI really think Cal\u2019s a fine young man,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cThen you date him,\u201d Linnette teased, hoping to find a gentle way of getting out of this.</p><p>\u201cThe least you can do is call him. Let me tell you a bit about Cal. He works for Cliff Harding on his horse ranch. I never quite understood what Cal does, but he appears to be a trainer of some sort. I don\u2019t know that much about horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d The more Linnette heard, the less enthusiastic she became. She was going to spend the evening with a man who hung around horses all day. Great.</p><p>Corrie frowned impatiently. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that look. You might be pleasantly surprised.\u201d</p> <p>Linnette had been avoiding this conversation. \u201cI did mention that the clinic hired Dr. Chad Timmons, didn\u2019t I? We worked together while I was in school and, Mom, he\u2019s just fabulous.\u201d</p><p>Her mother made a dismissive gesture with her hand. \u201cWhat has that got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Timmons is everything I want in a husband. He\u2019s smart, witty, drop-dead gorgeous. Plus he\u2019s kind and considerate. He\u2019s my idea of the perfect man.\u201d Linnette figured her chances of snagging him had risen substantially when he was hired to work at the medical center. She\u2019d nearly turned cartwheels down the street in her excitement. Having Chad right there, in Cedar Cove, made her position at the clinic a million times more appealing.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019ve set your sights on this doctor?\u201d</p><p>Linnette grinned sheepishly. \u201cNothing gets past my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny. What about Cal Washburn?\u201d</p> <p>Linnette was putting her foot down. She wasn\u2019t moving to this town so her parents could run her life\u2014or her love life. She\u2019d had enough of that while she lived at home. Her father had drilled every date unmercifully. It was a wonder she\u2019d found a boy willing to take her to the Junior-Senior prom.</p><p>\u201cAh...I suppose I could go out with this horse guy once, but that\u2019s it, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would please me, considering the amount of cash I paid for your date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I said I\u2019d do it.\u201d She\u2019d postponed it as long as she could but, yes, eventually she\u2019d get in touch with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll call?\u201d Corrie pressed.</p><p>\u201cCan I move into my apartment first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to set the date now.\u201d Corrie dug around in her purse and found the envelope with Cal\u2019s information, as well as an old receipt. \u201cI gave you his phone number already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost it,\u201d Linnette muttered. She had lost it, accidentally on purpose.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Corrie was busy scribbling the number on the back of the receipt.</p><p>Linnette wanted to grind her teeth in frustration. Her mother wasn\u2019t going to let this go. \u201cThink how useful it would be to have a doctor in the family,\u201d she said flippantly.</p><p>Corrie glared at her and handed over the phone number she\u2019d written down. \u201cJust do it, okay? It\u2019s only the one date and it\u2019d mean a lot to me if you followed up on this one small thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Linnette muttered again, feeling disgruntled about the whole situation. But then\u2014as her mother had said\u2014she might be pleasantly surprised.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll call him right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinnette, how often do I ask anything of you?\u201d</p><p>The old guilt trick, and it worked every time. \u201cOkay, I promise I\u2019ll arrange to meet this bachelor guy as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll like him, Linnette, only...\u201d Her mother hesitated, biting her lower lip as if she wasn\u2019t sure she should continue.</p><p>\u201cOnly what?\u201d</p><p>Corrie sighed. \u201cApparently Cal Washburn has a slight...speech impediment.\u201d</p><p>Linnette\u2019s mouth fell open. If an evening with a guy who smelled like horse manure wasn\u2019t bad enough, she might not be able to understand a word he said. This was definitely more than she\u2019d bargained for.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2014\u201d</p><p>Corrie walked backward toward the open door. \u201cYou promised, remember?\u201d</p><p>Linnette shook her head as her mother disappeared around the corner and out of the apartment. She\u2019d be moving to Cedar Cove the following week. She wanted this date over with as quickly as possible. She just hoped Chad didn\u2019t hear about it.</p><p>Reaching for her purse, she pulled out her cell phone and dialed the number on the slip of paper Corrie had given her. Putting this off any longer would only create unnecessary conflict with her mother.</p><p>A man answered, but he sounded perfectly normal. \u201cThis is Linnette McAfee calling for Cal Washburn,\u201d she said crisply.</p><p>\u201cWell, hello, Linnette. Cal\u2019s been waiting for your phone call. I\u2019m Cliff Harding. Cal works for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, Cliff. Is Cal available?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, he\u2019s sitting right here.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, Cal was on the phone. \u201cH-hello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Linnette McAfee,\u201d she said quickly. So he had a slight stutter. But his speech was clear and intelligible. \u201cApparently my mother bought me a date with you last July at the Dog and Bachelor Auction.\u201d She didn\u2019t give him a chance to respond. \u201cI was wondering when would be convenient for me to collect on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny...t-time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m moving into town next weekend, but I could meet you before then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow-w-w-w about nex-x-xt Friday night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll meet you at The Lighthouse restaurant at seven.\u201d She suspected she\u2019d have to do all the talking, since he seemed rather shy, no doubt because of the stutter. She\u2019d probably have to pay for his dinner, too, she thought glumly.</p><p>\u201cS-s-sure. Friday.\u201d</p><p>Linnette clicked off her cell. This was the last time she\u2019d allow her mother to do anything like this. The very last time.</p><p>Six</p><p>Grace Sherman had been looking forward to this Friday night for a long time. Cliff Harding had invited her to dinner at his house\u2014the first sign in months that he still had feelings for her. This was just the encouragement Grace needed. She loved Cliff, but she\u2019d done something foolish, risking her entire future with him on an Internet relationship.</p><p>It had all started when her husband of thirty-five years had disappeared. Vietnam had changed Dan, and he wasn\u2019t the same man she\u2019d married when he returned from the war. He\u2019d lived a bleak, unhappy life, and often suffered from bouts of depression. After Dan\u2019s sudden disappearance, she\u2019d spent nearly a year searching for him, exhausting what savings she had, only to discover that her husband had driven deep into the woods with a trailer she didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d purchased, and killed himself.</p><p>In the months before she found out what had happened to Dan, Grace had met Cliff Harding. His patience and kindness had won her over and they\u2019d started to see each other\u2014but not until she\u2019d learned Dan\u2019s fate. Cliff was recently divorced after twenty years of marriage and dating was a new experience for them both.</p><p>In coming to know Cliff, Grace discovered that his ex-wife had been involved in multiple affairs throughout their marriage. Grace and Cliff grew close, close enough for him to fly her to Connecticut to meet his daughter, Lisa. Together they\u2019d spent Thanksgiving with Lisa and her family. That was almost two years ago.</p><p>About the same time, Will Jefferson, her best friend\u2019s brother, had started to e-mail Grace. She\u2019d had a crush on him as a teenager and was flattered by his attention. To this day, she wasn\u2019t sure how it happened, but soon she was logging on to the Internet at all hours of the day and night in order to \u201cchat\u201d with Will. He became her addiction. She was mortified now to admit that, all along, she\u2019d known he was married. He\u2019d fed her lie after lie, and she\u2019d swallowed each one because she so badly wanted to believe him. And while she maintained her online relationship with Will, she\u2019d continued dating Cliff.</p><p>Everything seemed to blow up in her face at once. Cliff found out about her Internet relationship and Grace realized that Will was still living with his wife, Georgia, and had no intention of divorcing her.</p><p>Cliff wanted nothing more to do with Grace. He\u2019d lived with one faithless woman and wasn\u2019t about to repeat that mistake. He\u2019d made it clear that they were through. Devastated, Grace could do nothing but abide by his wishes.</p><p>Then, last August, Lisa had flown out to spend time with her father. Grace would always be grateful to Cliff\u2019s daughter for visiting her at the library, where Grace was employed. Lisa had assured Grace that Cliff still loved her and encouraged her not to give up.</p><p>That was when Grace had begun a campaign to win back Cliff Harding. She mailed him cards, sent him e-mail messages and stopped by the ranch unannounced and uninvited. Little by little she\u2019d worn him down to the point that he\u2019d actually sought her out for the first time in more than a year.</p><p>When she arrived home from work, Grace tried three different outfits before she was satisfied. She modeled each of her choices before Buttercup, her golden retriever, and Sherlock, her cat. Unfortunately their opinions were less than useful, although she had to laugh at Buttercup\u2019s deep sigh. Sherlock didn\u2019t bother to open his eyes. In the end she chose a blue denim jumper with big yellow daisies painted on the bib and a yellow turtleneck underneath. It was similar to what she\u2019d been wearing the first day she met Cliff. This was a new beginning for them and she hoped her clothes relayed that message.</p><p>By the time Grace drove out to Cliff\u2019s ranch in Olalla, her nerves were frayed. She so badly wanted to be part of Cliff\u2019s life. Somehow, she had to make him understand that she wasn\u2019t like his ex-wife. For thirty-five years she\u2019d remained faithful to Dan and, given the opportunity, she\u2019d be faithful to him too. She wanted Cliff to know she\u2019d learned her lesson and learned it well. Never again would she risk losing him. If only he was willing to give her another chance...</p><p>There was no one about at the ranch as Grace pulled into the long drive, although another truck stood next to Cliff\u2019s newly completed barn. Parking near the house, Grace hesitated, unsure where to go. When Cliff failed to answer the front door, she wandered toward the barn. Cal lived in an apartment above, and he might be able to tell her what was going on.</p><p>She was halfway to the barn when Cliff came rushing out. He stopped abruptly, staring at her, his expression confused. He was a big man with a muscular build, easily six three in height. He wore a cowboy hat and boots and looked every bit the horseman he\u2019d become since his retirement from Boeing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCliff?\u201d she said in a tentative voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat day is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFriday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this the Friday I invited you for dinner?\u201d</p> <p>Her heart fell and she nodded. He\u2019d forgotten. Still, she tried to smile as she said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid it is.\u201d</p><p>He was immediately apologetic. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Grace. I didn\u2019t realize it was this Friday. As you can see, we\u2019re having a problem here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Cliff shook his head grimly. \u201cIt\u2019s Midnight. He\u2019s got colic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColic?\u201d In Grace\u2019s experience, that was an ailment babies came down with during their first few months. She remembered pacing the floor with Kelly, her youngest, as the infant screamed in unrelieved pain.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s life-threatening in horses,\u201d Cliff explained. \u201cThe vet\u2019s here and we\u2019re doing everything we can to save him. If worse comes to worse, surgery might be necessary.\u201d He removed his hat and wiped his forearm across his brow. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Grace, we\u2019ll have dinner another time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d she asked, willing to push up her sleeves and help to whatever extent she could.</p><p>\u201cI was about to make a pot of coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that and bring it out when it\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Cliff nodded. \u201cGreat. I\u2019d appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give it a second thought.\u201d</p> <p>Once inside the kitchen, Grace searched through several cupboards until she located the coffee grounds. While the coffee brewed, she brought out bread and made half a dozen sandwiches, using the ham and cheese slices she found in the refrigerator. She wasn\u2019t sure how long this crisis had been in effect, but she guessed that Cliff, Cal and the vet could use something to eat.</p><p>When everything was ready, Grace carried a tray with the coffeepot and a plate of sandwiches into the barn. Doc Newton was the first one to notice Grace\u2019s presence. As she stood, she smiled her gratitude.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love a cup of that coffee. With cream,\u201d Vickie said.</p><p>Setting down the tray, Grace filled a mug for her.</p><p>Cliff, who was on his knees beside the stallion, barely glanced over his shoulder. A large tube came out of the horse\u2019s mouth and to Grace\u2019s uneducated eye, the animal appeared to be in bad shape. Cal was on the other side, gently stroking the black muzzle as he talked in low, soothing tones. Grace realized that for the first time since she\u2019d met Cal, he wasn\u2019t stuttering. Apparently he could communicate with horses better than humans.</p><p>Grace poured Cliff a mug of hot coffee. He took it from her with a scant nod of acknowledgement. She offered some to Cal, but he shook his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a waiting game now,\u201d Doc Newman told Grace.</p><p>\u201cWhat are Midnight\u2019s chances?\u201d</p> <p>The vet shrugged. \u201cCould go either way.\u201d</p><p>Grace knew that Cliff had a large financial investment in this stallion, but there was more to it. He loved that horse. He\u2019d often talked about his dreams for the ranch, and it went without saying that Midnight was the very basis of Cliff\u2019s future in ranching. She speculated that losing the stallion could set him back years. But it would be a personal loss as much as a financial one.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, Grace stepped into the background and waited. She didn\u2019t feel she could just walk away. She might not be able to give him any real help, but she wanted Cliff to know she cared.</p><p>After an hour she saw that she wasn\u2019t contributing anything. No one wanted more food or coffee, so she returned to the house. It took her all of five minutes to clean up the kitchen. Bored, she turned on the television, flicking from channel to channel, not settling on any one program for more than a few minutes. Every half hour she went to the barn to see what was happening, but there seemed to be virtually no progress. As Doc Newman had said, it was a waiting game.</p><p>At ten Grace fell asleep in front of the television, waking with a start at shortly after eleven. She looked outside and saw that Doc Newman\u2019s truck was gone. When she hurried out to the barn again, Grace saw that nothing had changed. Cliff and Cal were still with Midnight; neither seemed to notice her. As quietly as she could, she slipped out of the barn and went back to the house to collect her things.</p><p>Not wanting to interrupt Cliff, she climbed into her car and drove home, feeling depressed. She was worried about Midnight\u2019s colic, of course, and extremely upset by Cliff\u2019s attitude toward her. She wondered if he regretted the dinner invitation. Even if Midnight hadn\u2019t taken sick, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered. Cliff hadn\u2019t even remembered this was the night she was coming to dinner. He\u2019d made no preparations, nor had he shown the slightest interest in seeing her. If anything, he seemed happy to avoid her.</p><p>Buttercup and Sherlock were waiting when she let herself into the house and their obvious pleasure at her return comforted Grace. She saw that the message light on her phone was blinking. After leaving her purse on the washing machine, she sat down at her small kitchen table to listen, pen in hand.</p><p>A faint smile touched her lips at the sound of her best friend\u2019s voice. Olivia wanted to hear all about Grace\u2019s \u201chot\u201d dinner date. \u201cPhone when you get home. I don\u2019t care how late it is.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Grace reached for the telephone. Olivia answered on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything better to do on a Friday night than sit by the phone?\u201d Grace chided.</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s still at the office.\u201d</p><p>Olivia didn\u2019t sound pleased, and Grace didn\u2019t blame her. \u201cIt\u2019s almost eleven-thirty!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it,\u201d Olivia muttered. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t call to hear me complain about Jack. How\u2019d it go with Cliff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDreadful.\u201d Grace went on to fill in the details, ending with her suspicion that Cliff seemed to regret inviting her.</p><p>Olivia was silent when she finished. \u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Grace asked, discouraged and baffled by Cliff\u2019s behavior.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not giving up, are you?\u201d Olivia challenged.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d but this wasn\u2019t said with a lot of enthusiasm. \u201cI guess not. But if he doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll phone you in the morning,\u201d Olivia broke in.</p><p>Somehow Grace doubted that. It was as if Cliff had put her out of his mind.</p><p>Seven</p><p>Jack Griffin was tired and hungry. It was past nine on Tuesday and he still hadn\u2019t left the office; Olivia would be annoyed. He loved that woman, but he craved the challenge of his job as editor of The Cedar Cove Chronicle, too. Olivia claimed he had printer\u2019s ink running through his veins and he figured she was right\u2014otherwise he\u2019d resent all the hours he spent getting out five issues a week.</p><p>When he\u2019d been offered the position of editor four years earlier, the newspaper published a single issue each week and was planning to increase that to two. Since he was in his fifties and ready to cut back on the grueling hours he put in for the Spokane daily paper, he\u2019d willingly accepted fewer hours\u2014and less pay. The attraction of moving to Cedar Cove was more than just working for The Chronicle. The real draw was being close to Bob Beldon and to Eric, Jack\u2019s son, who lived in the Seattle area, too. Ironically Eric and his family had moved to Reno three years ago.</p><p>Bob Beldon was Jack\u2019s AA sponsor and best friend. Several years earlier, Bob and Peggy had returned to the area and purchased a run-down home on Cranberry Point. Being an all-around handyman, Bob had quickly transformed the huge house into a successful bed-and-breakfast they called Thyme and Tide. The thyme part came from Peggy, who\u2019d immediately planted an herb garden, along with a variety of fruits, vegetables and flowers. Her blueberry muffins were legendary.</p><p>After a single visit to Cedar Cove, Jack fell in love with the small community. He interviewed for the Chronicle job and got it. He found a decent rental and settled into what he assumed would be a more leisurely pace of life. He was looking forward to it, looking forward to a change.</p><p>Change had come, all right, but not in the way he\u2019d expected. Soon after his arrival in Cedar Cove, he\u2019d met Olivia Lockhart, and the woman had turned his world upside down.</p><p>In an effort to become acquainted with the community, Jack had visited her courtroom for a day and watched her deal out judgments on a series of cases. One judgment stood out. A young couple who\u2019d lost their child came before her, seeking a divorce. While most people in the courtroom watched the exchange between the two lawyers presenting the case, Jack had focused his attention on Olivia. He found her mesmerizing. As she studied the couple, her eyes had filled with pain. Only later did Jack learn that Olivia had lost a child, too. Her thirteen-year-old son had drowned in 1986. Under the weight of grief and loss, her own marriage had dissolved. When she denied the couple\u2019s divorce on a technicality, in effect forcing husband and wife to reconsider, he knew he had to write about her in his column.</p><p>Unfortunately Olivia had taken exception to what Jack had written. They met one Saturday morning in the local grocery and\u2014although she might not have realized it at the time\u2014their courtship had begun. He fell hard for her and he hadn\u2019t recovered yet. The truth was, he didn\u2019t plan to. They\u2019d been married for over a year and his life had never been more satisfying.</p><p>Every now and then Jack had to marvel that a woman as classy as Olivia would marry an ex-alcoholic newsman who didn\u2019t even know which fork to use if there were more than two. But marry him she had, and he considered himself the luckiest man alive.</p><p>Of course, Olivia being Olivia, she\u2019d taken it upon herself to educate him. She felt there were some rough edges that needed smoothing out. They\u2019d had a difficult few months in the beginning, while they adjusted to living with each other. Jack was willing to admit he was a slob. Olivia, on the other hand, had a highly developed sense of order and his slovenly habits had driven his poor wife insane.</p><p>He just didn\u2019t understand why it was so important to hang up his pants every night when he intended to put them on again in the morning. He made an effort because he knew it pleased her. The same with the peanut butter jar. According to Olivia, he was spreading germs around the entire house by leaving it open on the countertop with a knife stuck in it. So now he took out the knife, put on the lid and shoved it in the fridge. And these days, he actually hung the towel on the rack when he was done with it. He could never arrange them precisely the way Olivia liked, but she didn\u2019t complain. He rinsed off his dinner plate each night and placed it inside the dishwasher, too. Love apparently did that to a man.</p><p>The one area that still met with resistance was this diet she had him on. All right, he\u2019d admit it; he could afford to lose a few pounds. Jack had a bit of a paunch, but it wasn\u2019t that bad. Every once in a while, a man needed a double-bacon cheeseburger with all the fixings. He wasn\u2019t opposed to a large order of fries with that, either. They both went well with a vanilla shake.</p><p>Just thinking about his favorite meal made Jack\u2019s mouth water as he got into his car to drive home. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he\u2019d eaten. Breakfast had been blueberry yogurt with something stirred into it\u2014probably wheat germ. He hated the taste of wheat germ, so his beloved wife had taken to disguising it. He let her think he\u2019d been fooled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the sign for his favorite fast-food restaurant came into view, his decision was made. The drive-through window was open and he rolled straight up to it. Sitting in the parking lot, he wolfed down his cheeseburger at record speed, hardly stopping to savor the sheer luxury of it. He washed it down with the vanilla shake and munched on salty fries. He\u2019d be in trouble with Olivia if she found out about this, but that burger had been worth it.</p><p>Hell, he was already in trouble. He\u2019d told her he\u2019d be home by seven and it was nearly ten. Knowing she was probably trying to reach him, he\u2019d turned off his cell. He felt guilty about that now. An emergency had developed when the computer system crashed and he\u2019d had to stay until everything was up and running again. He had a newspaper to get out, and there was nothing he could do but see this crisis through.</p><p>The lights in the living room were on when Jack parked in front of the house. He\u2019d come to appreciate Olivia\u2019s home on Lighthouse Road, which had a wonderful view of the cove. Jack enjoyed sitting beside Olivia on her wide front porch, watching the sun set on a summer night.</p><p>He\u2019d wondered, when they were first married, if he\u2019d be comfortable in a house where Olivia had once lived with her ex-husband. His fears had come to nothing. Olivia and Stan had been divorced for more years than they\u2019d been married, and almost every trace of Stan was gone. There was the odd family photograph here and there, but he didn\u2019t begrudge Olivia that.</p> <p>Hoping she was asleep, he sneaked into the kitchen as quietly as possible. But the instant the floor creaked, Olivia called his name.</p><p>\u201cHi, honey,\u201d he said.</p><p>Olivia marched into the kitchen like the third brigade, dressed in her thick fleece housecoat and fuzzy slippers. Her arms were crossed and she glared at him. \u201cYou turned off your cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sorry enough.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI left a message for you,\u201d he said, pleading his case. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything I could do.\u201d He explained the computer situation, repeating the message he\u2019d left on their answering machine, and hoped she understood that he just couldn\u2019t answer questions at the time.</p><p>She hesitated, and he could see her weaken. \u201cSometimes I wonder why we ever got married. I see less of you now than I did while we were dating.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes Jack felt the same way. \u201cIt seems like that, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d He brought her into the circle of his arms. He loved the smell of her hair and breathed in the scent that was distinctly hers. \u201cThere are other advantages to being married, though,\u201d he whispered, slipping his hand inside the front of her housecoat. To his delight she wasn\u2019t wearing her long flannel nightgown, but the silk one that offered him easy access to her breasts.</p><p>\u201cJack, honestly,\u201d she protested, but not too loudly.</p><p>\u201cCome on, honey, I\u2019m tired. Let\u2019s go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFamished.\u201d Her nipples were hard and he felt the stirrings of desire. Ten minutes ago he didn\u2019t think he had enough energy to do more than undress and fall into bed. But now...Well, Olivia had that kind of effect on him.</p><p>\u201cI can warm up dinner in the microwave.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled her neck. \u201cI ate on the way home,\u201d he whispered as he brought his mouth to hers. The kiss was long and deep.</p><p>Olivia was the one who broke it off. \u201cJack Griffin, what did you have for dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him, shaking her head in disgust.</p><p>\u201cCome on, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018honey\u2019 me. Don\u2019t you realize what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was hungry and a cheeseburger sounded so good.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t look at him.</p><p>Jack eased her back into his arms. \u201cI have an idea that might wipe out all the evil traces of that sinful dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He slid his hands back inside her warm housecoat, weighing the bounty of her breasts in his palms. It didn\u2019t take much for his desire to be rekindled. \u201cCan\u2019t you guess? I think a little exercise might do wonders for me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes were closed and she let out a soft sigh in response.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always telling me how good exercise is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d she agreed. \u201cBut I thought you were tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d he admitted, his voice sinking to a murmur as he led her toward their bedroom.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack,\u201d she whispered, climbing onto the bed. \u201cI was so angry with you this evening, and now look at me. I\u2019m like...like mush in your arms.\u201d</p><p>This was why he loved her so much: She was as vulnerable to him as he was to her. Kneeling on the bed in front of her, Jack peeled off her nightgown and gloried in the sheen of her bare skin in the room\u2019s faint light.</p><p>He was ready for her, painfully ready, as he stripped off his pants and let them drop to the floor. He doubted Olivia would object if he didn\u2019t hang them up tonight.</p><p>Eight</p><p>\u201cLet me look at you,\u201d Corrie McAfee said as Linnette headed toward the front door of the house on Harbor Street, ready to leave for her dinner date with Cal Washburn. She\u2019d stayed with her parents for the last few nights.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Linnette protested. It wasn\u2019t as if she cared whether or not she made a good impression on this blind date. The fact that she was stuck going out with Cal was irritating enough without having to withstand her mother\u2019s scrutiny.</p><p>Corrie stepped back to inspect her daughter\u2019s appearance and smiled approvingly. Then, apparently noticing a speck of lint, Corrie brushed it away from Linnette\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou look lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Mom.\u201d Linnette hadn\u2019t gone to any effort. The long black suede skirt and white sweater weren\u2019t new. The knee-high boots were from last year and her jewelry was a simple locket and gold earrings. She was presentable, and that was good enough. The last thing she wanted to do was impress this cowpoke.</p><p>Her intention was to fulfill her obligation and, if possible, enjoy the meal. If Cal asked her out again, she\u2019d simply have to explain that she needed time to settle into her new home. In other words, she\u2019d contact him when and if she was interested. She didn\u2019t want to lead him on; as far as she was concerned, this was one date and one date only.</p><p>\u201cHave a wonderful time,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cMom, don\u2019t!\u201d Linnette groaned. \u201cI hate it when you look at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Her mother frowned, her expression completely baffled.</p><p>\u201cYou have all these expectations about me and Cal, and it\u2019s so unfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d Roy asked, walking into the living room where the two women stood.</p><p>\u201cBoth of you,\u201d Linnette cried.</p><p>\u201cHey, what did I do?\u201d Roy asked, glancing at Corrie.</p><p>Linnette gestured at them. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019ve got me married to...to some man I haven\u2019t even met. Is it any wonder I don\u2019t want to go on this stupid date?\u201d</p><p>Her father reached for The Cedar Cove Chronicle and shrugged. \u201cThen don\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>Corrie gasped. \u201cI paid good money for this dinner. I want you to go out with him at least once. It would be rude to phone at the last minute and cancel.\u201d</p><p>Linnette had thought of that herself. As much as she wanted out of this, she refused to be unkind about it. But now that she had her parents\u2019 attention, there was another matter she needed to bring up.</p><p>\u201cI want to know more about those postcards you\u2019ve been receiving.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s eyes narrowed accusingly on her mother.</p><p>Before he could blame Corrie for betraying confidences, Linnette explained how she knew. \u201cI found one, Dad, so don\u2019t get all bent out of shape. She tried to keep your scary little secret, but I read one of those postcards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t had any more in the last week,\u201d Corrie added quickly. She hesitated, then turned to Roy. \u201cHave we?\u201d</p><p>Roy\u2019s frown darkened his entire face. \u201cNo. And the subject is closed.\u201d With that, he sat down and hid behind the newspaper.</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t do any good to question him,\u201d her mother whispered. She silently pleaded with her to drop the subject.</p><p>Linnette already knew how stubborn and unreasonable her father could be. She was furious that he\u2019d excluded her like this. He did the same thing to Mack. Linnette found it chilling that her own father could pretend she wasn\u2019t there, seeking answers, needing reassurance. He didn\u2019t seem to understand that she wasn\u2019t asking these questions because she was intruding on their business. Her concern was genuine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better leave now,\u201d she said, retrieving the suede jacket that matched her skirt.</p><p>Cal had agreed to meet her at The Lighthouse, the finest restaurant in town, at seven. Linnette was prepared to pay for the dinner if it came to that, but she hoped Cal would offer, since she wasn\u2019t on the clinic payroll yet. Her mother had paid big bucks for this guy, although Linnette wasn\u2019t sure precisely how much. She knew it was over four hundred dollars each for Cal and the dog, who was definitely worth her share of the money. In Linnette\u2019s humble opinion, Cal should be the one paying the tab for tonight\u2019s dinner. Nevertheless, she had enough cash to cover it, unless he ordered expensive drinks.</p><p>\u201cHave a good time,\u201d Corrie said again as she walked Linnette to the door.</p><p>Linnette didn\u2019t think that was possible. \u201cAny words of wisdom?\u201d she asked in a resigned voice.</p><p>The question appeared to please her mother. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about Cal. However, Grace Sherman at the library says he\u2019s a wonderful man but shy, so you might have to carry the conversation.\u201d</p><p>Linnette had already figured that. With his stutter, it might be difficult to have much of a conversation at all. Linnette was afraid this evening would be torture. She knew it was going to be a struggle not to finish his sentences for him. Doing that would be terribly impolite and, of course, Cal would resent it, with good reason.</p><p>Linnette wasn\u2019t looking forward to going home that night, either; her mother would almost certainly be waiting up to interrogate her about the evening with Cal. But Linnette had a few questions of her own. She hoped to learn more about these postcards so she could tell her brother. Linnette felt they had a right to know that their parents were in potential danger.</p><p>If her father\u2019s reaction to a simple question was any indication, she could forget about any hope of shared information from him. He wasn\u2019t talking, but she might be able to persuade her mother to drop a few hints.</p><p>When she reached the restaurant, Linnette parked in the only available spot and walked up the steps to The Lighthouse foyer. Funny, she\u2019d never thought to ask Cal what he looked like. Now, standing in a foyer crowded with people, all waiting to be seated, she glanced around, hoping she\u2019d somehow recognize him. Unfortunately, there seemed to be a number of single men milling about.</p><p>Wanting to avoid the embarrassment of asking strangers their names, Linnette decided there must be a logical way to do this. Cal would probably be wearing cowboy boots. Unfortunately, that meant she was walking around with her head down, staring at everyone\u2019s feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She found a man with a polished pair of boots and raised her head. She immediately dismissed him as a possibility. He was far too old. Her survey continued. Scuffed boots\u2014too young. Snakeskin boots\u2014nope. Too urban.</p><p>\u201cLinnette?\u201d</p><p>She abruptly looked up and nearly collided with a lean, wiry man of about thirty-five. He wore a cowboy hat and western-style jacket with leather patches on the sleeves and\u2014yes, indeed\u2014cowboy boots. Linnette\u2019s expectations hadn\u2019t been high, but if this was Cal Washburn, he far exceeded her hopes. He was a pleasant-looking man, not striking, but obviously in good shape. Brown hair and eyes, prominent cheekbones, a solid jaw and surprise of surprises, a warm smile.</p><p>\u201cCal?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cI h-have a reservation.\u201d With his hand at the small of her back, he directed her to the desk.</p><p>The woman behind the counter looked at them expectantly.</p><p>\u201cW-Washburn,\u201d Cal said.</p><p>She scanned the list and scratched out his name when she located it on the reservation sheet. Reaching for two menus, she said, \u201cYour table is ready.\u201d</p><p>Linnette had no idea The Lighthouse restaurant did such a rousing business. It hadn\u2019t occurred to her to make reservations, and she was grateful Cal had.</p> <p>Once they were seated, Linnette opened her menu, studied the selections and chose the seafood fettuccini with clams, scallops and Hood Canal shrimp. It sounded appetizing\u2014and was affordably priced. She\u2019d stick to the free rolls for her appetizer.</p><p>The waiter came for their drink order and Linnette decided on iced tea. Cal asked for a whiskey sour. Remembering that her funds were limited, Linnette opened her menu again to see if there was a price list for mixed drinks. Yes\u2014to her horror, it was made with premium whiskey and cost almost ten dollars.</p><p>After their drinks arrived, they made small talk, with Linnette doing most of the talking, just as she\u2019d assumed she would. Cal seemed interested in her work as a Physician\u2019s Assistant and was impressed that she could prescribe medications and treat minor injuries. She described the first times she\u2019d sutured a wound and put on a cast and how nervous she\u2019d been.</p><p>The waiter returned for their meal order and it was as if Cal had only recently discovered food. He ordered a crab-and-artichoke dip for an appetizer, plus a dinner salad with shrimp. The seafood topping cost extra. For his entr\u00e9e, he chose a T-bone steak.</p><p>Linnette casually looked at the menu a second time and checked on the price of the steak. According to her calculations, his tab alone would add up to all the cash she carried.</p><p>\u201cIs s-something wr-rong?\u201d Cal inquired.</p> <p>She leaned closer and tried to figure out a way to explain that she was on a limited budget, but couldn\u2019t. It was just too humiliating. \u201cN-nothing,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>\u201cYou stutter?\u201d His eyes widened as though he\u2019d met his soul mate.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cCal, I\u2014\u201d She began to explain that they might need to split the bill, but just then the waiter delivered the rolls and the appetizer.</p><p>Despite her predictions, Linnette actually had an enjoyable time. She relaxed after she started eating. Cal insisted she have a glass of wine with her meal; the expense was more than she could afford, but she let him talk her into it. When she tasted the chardonnay, she was glad she\u2019d succumbed. The wine was not only delicious, it went a long way toward calming her nerves.</p><p>She shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that Cal ordered dessert\u2014New York-style cheesecake, no less. He also requested two forks.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t,\u201d she insisted, placing both hands on her stomach.</p><p>\u201cOne taste,\u201d Cal said.</p><p>\u201cWe bake it here at the restaurant,\u201d the waiter told her. \u201cIt\u2019s our most popular dessert.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she acquiesced, \u201cone taste.\u201d</p><p>Linnette ended up eating most of it. She didn\u2019t normally like heavy desserts, but this was exceptional\u2014the best she\u2019d ever tasted.</p><p>They lingered over coffee, and then the waiter brought the bill, tucked inside a leather sleeve. It stood in the middle of the table, impossible to ignore. By her estimate\u2014she\u2019d kept a running total in her head until the wine, at which point she\u2019d lost count\u2014the tab far exceeded her cash. Granted, she had her VISA, but she was already close to her limit on that. For a long moment, Linnette stared at the bill, still concealed in its folder, and prayed this man her mother considered such a paragon would reach for it.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Linnette was beginning to worry. \u201cShall we split this?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>Cal picked up the bill and looked it over. He didn\u2019t say what her half would be. \u201cI\u2019ll t-t-take care of it on the way out,\u201d he said.</p><p>Linnette nodded.</p><p>\u201cI had a nice time.\u201d He seemed as astonished as she was.</p><p>\u201cI did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t l-l-like I ex-x-x-pected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither are you.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at his watch. \u201cCan I w-walk you to your v-v-vehi\u2014car?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou go on, while I pay my half of the bill. Thank you, Cal, for a most enjoyable evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-y-you\u2019re welcome.\u201d He dropped his napkin on the table and stood.</p><p>The restaurant wasn\u2019t as busy as it had been earlier. Several couples sat with their heads close together, enjoying each other\u2019s company. Some evening Linnette hoped that would be Chad Timmons and her.</p><p>Once Cal had left, Linnette sighed deeply and decided she\u2019d better figure out what she owed. She reached for the bill and was shocked to find it had already been paid. Frowning, she motioned for the waiter. \u201cThis is completely paid? The tip, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the gentleman made arrangements with the restaurant before you arrived. He left his credit card with the hostess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He might\u2019ve said something. Still, Linnette felt she should thank him. However, when she hurried out to the parking lot, Cal was already gone.</p><p>Nine</p><p>It was the first Tuesday of November, the day Charlotte and Ben were having dinner with his son. That afternoon, she sorted through her closet in search of a dress to wear. She finally decided on the pink-and-white one she\u2019d purchased for her wedding reception. With its row of tiny ribbon rosebuds edging the collar it made her feel feminine and attractive. Although the outfit was better suited for spring than autumn, she hoped to make a positive impression on David.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d she asked Ben, stepping out of the bedroom and brushing the wrinkles out of her skirt. She waited for her husband\u2019s approval.</p><p>Ben glanced up from the television set and frowned.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Charlotte asked, crestfallen. She wanted to do her husband proud.</p><p>\u201cYou went to far too much trouble. You don\u2019t need to impress David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...I want your son to like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, dear, and I appreciate that, but it isn\u2019t necessary. I suspect the only reason David asked us to have dinner is to see if I\u2019ll give him another loan.\u201d Ben\u2019s face hardened. \u201cI refuse to do it. I told him that the last time and I\u2019m not going to change my mind.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cJust watch. We\u2019ll get stuck with the bill, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ben, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not true. Anyway, he invited us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you can bet I\u2019ll be paying the tab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ben, don\u2019t be so negative.\u201d</p><p>Ben didn\u2019t argue with her. She could tell he was nervous and that he regretted agreeing to this. He revealed no pleasure at seeing David or the prospect of a rare evening out in downtown Seattle.</p><p>While it was still daylight, Ben and Charlotte drove over to Bremerton and walked onto the Seattle-bound ferry. During the hour-long commute, Ben was uncharacteristically silent. They held hands and sipped coffee, and Charlotte watched Bainbridge Island fade into the distance as the Seattle skyline came into view. It really was a lovely time of year in Puget Sound. By the end of the month, Christmas decorations would be up, and a festive spirit would suffuse Cedar Cove.</p><p>Once the ferry docked in Seattle, Ben ushered Charlotte down the ramp and out of the terminal. They took one of the taxis waiting on the street outside and rode up to Martini\u2019s Steakhouse, the restaurant David had chosen.</p><p>Ben led Charlotte to an elevator that brought them to the lower floor. As she stepped off, her interest was immediately captured by the signed photographs of famous people who\u2019d dined at Martini\u2019s.</p><p>A man who could only be Ben\u2019s son sat in the restaurant foyer. He was handsome, a younger version of his father with dark hair and a strong presence. He glanced up and smiled when he saw Ben and Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cHello, David.\u201d Ben spoke without emotion.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d David said eagerly, standing. He hugged his father and slapped him affectionately on the back. When he\u2019d finished, he gave Charlotte a warm smile.</p><p>\u201cThis is Charlotte,\u201d Ben said, placing his arm protectively around her shoulders.</p><p>David held out his arms and drew her into an enthusiastic hug. \u201cI am so delighted to finally meet you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve made my father a very happy man.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte was instantly charmed. Ben didn\u2019t have a thing to worry about, she decided; this was certain to be a wonderful evening. When David released her, she looked at Ben and found him scowling. She couldn\u2019t imagine why he was being so unpleasant.</p><p>David\u2019s smile dimmed slightly as he regarded his father. \u201cCome on, Dad,\u201d he said. \u201cRelax. Let\u2019s enjoy the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Charlotte chimed in. \u201cI\u2019m meeting your son for the first time and we\u2019re going to have a great meal. Let\u2019s enjoy ourselves.\u201d</p><p>David directed his attention to her as they waited for the hostess to return from seating the couple in front of them. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how sorry I was to miss the wedding,\u201d he said, avoiding his father\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to introducing you to my children,\u201d Charlotte told him happily. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get a chance to meet them soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I will, too. Again I apologize about missing the big day but summer\u2019s an especially busy time for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d Charlotte asked, and refrained from reminding him that they were married the first week of May, which was actually spring.</p><p>\u201cI work in insurance,\u201d David said. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain but I deal with actuaries and statistics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d Charlotte nodded. \u201cAll of that\u2019s beyond me. Clyde always took care of that sort of thing. I\u2019m grateful he did. Clyde was my first husband,\u201d she told him. Although he\u2019d been gone almost twenty-five years, Clyde had seen to Charlotte\u2019s financial needs before his death. She would be forever grateful.</p><p>The hostess seemed to be waiting for them to finish their conversation.</p><p>\u201cOur table\u2019s ready,\u201d Ben said, steering them toward the young woman.</p><p>They were quickly seated, and Charlotte took the opportunity to look around. A single glance convinced her that this was one of the finest restaurants she\u2019d ever been inside. To date, the most elegant restaurant she\u2019d eaten in belonged to her own granddaughter, Justine. Justine and Seth owned The Lighthouse in Cedar Cove and had made a brilliant success of it. She was near to bursting with pride about her granddaughter, who\u2019d had the good sense to marry a solid man like Seth Gunderson. When David visited Cedar Cove, she\u2019d make sure he had a chance to dine at The Lighthouse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Their waiter approached the table, wheeling a cart, and with a good deal of ceremony revealed virtually a complete menu. Her head spun as he displayed and then described each item. When he was finished, they were given a price list. Charlotte studied it and gasped aloud. But, my goodness, it all looked so delicious. She made a mental note to tell Justine every detail she could remember. Her granddaughter would want to know about this. After the elaborate presentation, she ordered the grilled swordfish and both men ordered steaks.</p><p>The meal was superb and so was the service. The conversation, too, was enjoyable. David had an engaging manner and did most of the talking. He chatted about the weather and recent movies and how he planned to go to Vegas for Christmas. Ben remained stubbornly quiet, as he had before; it was up to Charlotte to respond to his son\u2019s questions and remarks. The one irritation was David\u2019s cell phone, which rang four times during the course of their meal.</p><p>After the fourth call, Ben snapped, \u201cTurn that damn thing off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d David did look apologetic as he reached for his cell and pushed a button. The telephone sang a brief song and then went silent.</p> <p>Charlotte breathed a sigh of relief and smiled at the waiter who brought coffee to their table with several varieties of sugar from which to choose. Charlotte was quite taken with the hard candy sticks that looked like something out of a confectionary store.</p><p>Over coffee, David grew quiet. \u201cYou might\u2019ve guessed why I wanted to meet with you, Dad,\u201d he said as he stirred in the cream.</p><p>\u201cDavid, if this is about money\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m in a tight spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t or won\u2019t?\u201d David asked with barely suppressed anger.</p><p>Ben\u2019s shoulders heaved as if he\u2019d inhaled sharply in an effort to control his own annoyance. \u201cSince you put it like that, the answer is won\u2019t. I refuse to give you another dime. You haven\u2019t paid back the last two loans. I\u2019d be a fool to give you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good for it. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said last time and the time before that. Why should I believe you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s true. Dad, do you think it\u2019s easy, coming to you like this? Do you think I\u2019d do this if I had any other options?\u201d</p><p>He seemed about to say more but Charlotte could see that his arguments increased Ben\u2019s irritation. \u201cHow much do you need?\u201d she asked. She didn\u2019t mean to intrude, but if it was a reasonable amount then perhaps Ben wouldn\u2019t mind so much.</p> <p>\u201cFive thousand,\u201d he said after a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s considerably less than I needed before,\u201d he added with a hopeful expression.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need it for?\u201d Charlotte asked, wanting to help and not knowing how. Her questions didn\u2019t please Ben, she could see that, but she felt badly for the young man.</p><p>David shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe usual, no doubt,\u201d Ben cut in. \u201cHis credit cards are maxed out, he hasn\u2019t paid his taxes and he\u2019s paying alimony for two ex-wives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting a bonus this Christmas,\u201d David said. \u201cI only need the money for a couple of months, just to carry me through. You know I wouldn\u2019t ask if I wasn\u2019t desperate. I\u2019m telling you, Dad, money pressures are the worst. I can\u2019t sleep nights. I can hardly eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly didn\u2019t have a problem tonight,\u201d Ben pointed out. David had obviously enjoyed his meal, and Charlotte was glad of that after seeing those prices. Fifty years ago, she could\u2019ve fed her family for a week for the price of a single steak.</p><p>David looked hurt. \u201cThis is the first decent meal I\u2019ve had in ages. You have to know how difficult this is for me. There\u2019s no one else I can ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s painful to ask for a loan,\u201d Charlotte said sympathetically.</p> <p>David thanked her for her understanding with a smile. \u201cI swear to you, Dad, I\u2019ll pay you back. I don\u2019t know what\u2019ll happen if you turn me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old are you now?\u201d Ben asked his son.</p><p>David straightened slightly. \u201cForty-three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally,\u201d Charlotte said conversationally. \u201cI would\u2019ve guessed much younger.\u201d</p><p>David ignored her, holding his father\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cForty-three is old enough to stand on your own two feet and stop expecting someone else to bail you out.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s shoulders slumped.</p><p>Charlotte felt dreadful for him, but she couldn\u2019t advise Ben when it came to dealing with his own child. She reached for Ben\u2019s hand under the table and he gripped it hard.</p><p>\u201cI told you the last time that I\u2019m not lending you another dime, and I\u2019m sticking to that. I have to, David. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re experiencing financial troubles, but apparently you didn\u2019t learn your lesson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Save your breath, because no amount of talking will change my mind.\u201d</p><p>David didn\u2019t argue, didn\u2019t get upset, but nodded as if he understood.</p><p>\u201cSo far, all I\u2019ve taught you is to come to me when you have money problems and that isn\u2019t healthy for either of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d David said reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cYou pay me back what you owe from the first two loans, and then we\u2019ll discuss future possibilities.\u201d</p><p>David pinched his lips together and nodded again. Pushing out his chair, he stood. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019d better get back to my hotel. Thank you for the pleasant dinner. Charlotte, I think the smartest thing my father\u2019s done in the last fifteen years was marrying you.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte blushed with pleasure. \u201cThank you, David.\u201d</p><p>He bowed slightly and walked out of the room.</p><p>With his exit, the waiter walked over to the table and promptly delivered the bill.</p><p>Ten</p><p>Home from work early because of her doctor\u2019s appointment, Cecilia Randall sat in front of her computer in the spare bedroom and logged on. She treasured every e-mail Ian sent, and when there wasn\u2019t one waiting for her at the end of the day, she immediately felt discouraged. To her delight, there were two messages. She clicked her mouse on the first, but before the computer brought it up on screen the phone rang.</p><p>Cecilia glanced over her shoulder, willing it to be silent. It was probably Cathy, wanting to hear how her appointment had gone. Everything was wonderful, and she had exciting news to share with Ian. She couldn\u2019t tell Cathy before she told her husband. By rights, he should hear first. If she picked up the phone and Cathy was on the line, Cecilia knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to keep the information to herself.</p><p>After the third ring, she couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and ran into the kitchen to grab the phone before the answering machine kicked in. \u201cHello,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cCecilia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home. You wouldn\u2019t believe what I went through to make this call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan, oh, Ian, it\u2019s so good to hear your voice.\u201d Tears filled her eyes. She loved her husband and missed him terribly. Every time he went to sea it was the same.</p><p>\u201cTell me about the doctor\u2019s visit,\u201d Ian demanded, worry in his voice. \u201cIt was this afternoon, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, and everything went really well.\u201d She was nearly bursting with what she\u2019d learned.</p><p>\u201cThey did the ultrasound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s all right with the baby?\u201d He sounded afraid, and she didn\u2019t blame him. If they\u2019d had more than one ultrasound with Allison, the doctors would\u2019ve discovered her heart condition before the birth. \u201cDid the ultrasound show anything?\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the kitchen wall, almost giddy with happiness. \u201cIt did.\u201d</p><p>Ian gasped as if this was his biggest fear.</p><p>\u201cIan, Ian, it isn\u2019t anything like that. Oh, Ian, we\u2019re going to have a son!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe technician had a good view this time, and she showed me his little penis. We\u2019re having a son.\u201d</p><p>Her husband was silent for half a second and then let out a yelp that must\u2019ve echoed a hundred miles. Cecilia was sure everyone on the aircraft carrier had heard him. She understood; it was the proof he needed that this pregnancy was different from their first.</p><p>Cecilia laughed with joy. They\u2019d been told this second baby was likely a girl and that had only added to her husband\u2019s fears. As Ian had said over and over, everything was the same as it had been with Allison. Cecilia was going to deliver another baby girl while he was away. Ian was so afraid for her, for them both. If they lost another baby...Cecilia couldn\u2019t allow her mind to go down those dark paths.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re sure about the baby being a boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWonderful. Ecstatic. And very much in love with my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Cecilia.\u201d His voice lowered with the weight of his emotion. \u201cI think of you day and night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorking isn\u2019t too much for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d Ian was such a worrier. But this job was vital to her. Without it, she\u2019d sit at home all day with nothing to do. Using her accounting skills and providing a portion of their income weren\u2019t the only reasons Cecilia chose to be employed. \u201cMr. Cox is so thoughtful and Allison\u2019s coming in to the office every day after school.\u201d Ian already knew this but she told him again. She made sure her e-mails were full of news about her everyday life. That seemed to reassure him.</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. Allison Cox,\u201d Ian said, sighing deeply. \u201cYou\u2019re concerned about her, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has that new boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t like him,\u201d Ian said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really know him, so I can\u2019t dislike him, but he worries me. Did I tell you his name is Anson? What kind of name is that, anyway? He\u2019s not the boy for Allison. He\u2019s one of those Goth kids, dresses totally in black and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Ian interrupted her. \u201cYour father said I wasn\u2019t the right man for you, remember?\u201d</p><p>At the mention of her father, Cecilia rolled her eyes. She\u2019d come to Cedar Cove four years earlier in an effort to get to know her father. Her parents had divorced when she was ten, and her memories of him were vague and mingled with her mother\u2019s bitterness. Cecilia wanted to form her own impressions of him. He\u2019d seemed eager to know her, too.</p><p>Cecilia\u2019s mother had warned her against having any expectations when it came to Bobby Merrick, but this was something she had to learn on her own. It hadn\u2019t taken her long to discover that her father was unreliable and irresponsible. When Cecilia lost her baby, his idea of comforting her was a sympathy card sent through the mail. He was sorry for her loss, he\u2019d written. But not once had he come to see his daughter in the hospital. Not once had he offered to help her with the financial burden. He couldn\u2019t even be bothered to attend Allison\u2019s burial. The only thing her father had done for Cecilia was get her a job at The Captain\u2019s Galley, where she\u2019d met Ian. For that one small twist of fate, she would always be grateful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the right man for me,\u201d she breathed, determined not to bring her father into the conversation. \u201cOh, Ian, I miss you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be home soon.\u201d</p><p>Not before the baby was born, but Cecilia couldn\u2019t think about that. This time she wasn\u2019t alone. Cathy Lackey would be with her and had promised to be her birthing coach. Cecilia had signed up for classes and they\u2019d be starting soon. Cathy would go with her.</p><p>When Cecilia delivered Allison she\u2019d been alone, not knowing a soul other than her father. The baby had arrived several weeks early. Her mother had intended to fly out, but couldn\u2019t reach her in time. Friendless and frightened, Cecilia had gone to the hospital on her own.</p> <p>\u201cWe need boy names, Ian,\u201d she said, breaking off those painful memories.</p><p>\u201cAh...I can\u2019t think of anything at the moment. Let me e-mail you a few suggestions. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But I think our son should have his daddy\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo confusing,\u201d Ian said. \u201cMaybe for his middle name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cListen, sweetheart, I have to go, but before I do I need to ask a favor for a friend of mine. He asked if you\u2019d mind checking on a girl for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Rachel Pendergast and she works at a beauty place in Cedar Cove called Get Nailed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it. Almost everyone gets their nails done there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate went out with Rachel a couple of times and seems pretty interested in her, but she doesn\u2019t have a computer. Apparently she writes him a lot, but it isn\u2019t the same as being able to communicate on-line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t she use the computer at the library?\u201d Cecilia asked. That was the one Cecilia had used when she and Ian were separated and she needed to keep in touch with him. With all the expenses related to burying Allison and the attorney\u2019s fees for their failed divorce, she\u2019d had no money for anything extra.</p> <p>\u201cApparently Rachel\u2019s never been on-line and isn\u2019t sure how it works. This is all new to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get her started,\u201d Cecilia promised.</p><p>\u201cThanks, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, my handsome, wonderful husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been since I told you I love you?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia smiled softly. \u201cToo long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She giggled with sheer happiness.</p> <p>\u201cA son,\u201d Ian whispered. \u201cA son.\u201d</p><p>Eleven</p><p>This was moving day. Linnette\u2019s brother had been a real help. He\u2019d arrived at her Seattle apartment early Saturday morning with Lucky, his Australian Shepherd, and a couple of his friends who were volunteer firefighters with Mack. The only stuff left to move was her furniture and a few of the heavier boxes. Linnette had already taken over what she could, a little at a time, but the larger items required a truck, which she\u2019d rented.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t begin to tell you how much I appreciate this,\u201d Linnette told her brother after he and his friends had loaded up the truck. Bryan and Drew were carrying down the dining room chairs. Her roommate had left a month earlier, and the place was now completely empty.</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Mack said. He\u2019d stayed behind. Now he wiped the sweat from his brow. \u201cI\u2019m glad I can help. I\u2019m hoping the two of us will have a chance to talk later.\u201d</p><p>Before Linnette could reply, Bryan stepped back into the room. \u201cYou ready to head out?\u201d he asked. He seemed eager to get going. Drew followed him inside, chanting, \u201cHey, hey, hey. We\u2019re on our way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be down in a minute,\u201d Mack told them.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find a chance to talk,\u201d Linnette promised.</p><p>\u201cGood. Maybe after we\u2019ve unloaded the big stuff, we can chat and then I\u2019ll drive the truck back to the rental place.\u201d It cost less to rent the vehicle if it was returned to the original location. Mack had graciously agreed to deliver it to Seattle for his sister.</p><p>Just as efficiently as he and his friends had loaded the U-Haul, they unpacked it, carted everything up the one flight of outdoor stairs and set her sofa, chair, lamp, coffee table and television in her small living room. Her bed and mattress, dresser and nightstand went into the larger of the two bedrooms. Her desk, chair and computer, which she\u2019d carefully boxed, were in the second room. Eventually Linnette planned to add a sleeper-sofa and maybe a small work table. She wanted to start doing crafts again, which was something she hadn\u2019t had time for while she was in school. The dining room table was a Salvation Army find, but it was pretty battered and Linnette hoped to replace it soon. With a regular income she\u2019d have a few more options.</p><p>When Mack and his friends were finished, Linnette treated them to take-out hamburgers, fries and cold drinks. As soon as they\u2019d wolfed those down, Drew and Bryan were on their way back to Seattle, with Linnette\u2019s fervent thanks ringing in their ears.</p><p>Mack sat on her sofa, leaned forward and set his wadded burger wrapper on her coffee table. Lucky, well-behaved dog that she was, had stayed obediently out of everyone\u2019s way and now rested at his side. As if gathering his thoughts, her brother waited a moment, then looked at Linnette. \u201cDo you know what\u2019s going on with Mom and Dad?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Her brother was astute, she\u2019d give him that. \u201cWhat makes you think anything\u2019s going on?\u201d She was interested in how he\u2019d picked up on this so quickly. As far as Linnette knew, he wasn\u2019t in regular communication with their parents.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s been phoning me every Sunday afternoon. It\u2019s gotten to be like clockwork. She hadn\u2019t said anything outright, but just recently, I\u2019d say in the last couple of weeks, she\u2019s made some remarks that don\u2019t add up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Mack hesitated. \u201cFor one thing, she casually mentioned that if anything were to happen to Dad, I should never doubt his love for me. I asked her if Dad was sick or there was something I should know, but she claimed there wasn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d lie to me, but I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s not telling me the whole truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Linnette encouraged. Her brother had good instincts and she wondered how much information he\u2019d been able to glean.</p><p>\u201cEvery time Mom phones, she assures me everything\u2019s fine. So, after a while, I started to think I might be imagining things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t,\u201d Linnette was quick to tell him, and then went on to describe the postcards her parents had received.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t threatening?\u201d Mack asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say for sure,\u201d Linnette said. \u201cThe only one I saw said, \u2018Are you thinking yet?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Mom, Dad assumes this has something to do with his work on the police force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome criminal he put away?\u201d Mack speculated.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps someone who has a vendetta against Dad. Whoever\u2019s doing this seems intent on psychologically wearing him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t work,\u201d Mack said with a slow grin. \u201cIf this person wants to torment our father, all he needs to do is grow his hair long, refuse to play football, drop out of college and take a job at the post office. That\u2019s enough to send the mighty Roy McAfee over the edge.\u201d</p><p>Linnette laughed, noticing anew what an attractive man her brother was. His build was similar to their father\u2019s, but as far as his looks went, he took after Grandpa Wilson, their mother\u2019s father.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they\u2019re in any real danger?\u201d Mack asked seriously.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve tried to get Mom to tell me how long this has been going on, but she doesn\u2019t want to worry me. The fact that she won\u2019t talk about it concerns me more. I told her that, and she got all teary and said Dad\u2019s been completely unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s unusual?\u201d Mack teased.</p><p>Linnette shook her head, smiling. \u201cApparently there\u2019s been more than the postcards.\u201d She sat down on the sofa beside her brother and stroked Lucky\u2019s head. \u201cMom said something about a fruit basket being delivered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t eat any of it, did they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what they did with it. I assume they threw it away. That one really freaked Mom out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine. I wonder if it\u2019s part of this person\u2019s method. You know, kill them with kindness, confuse the enemy\u2014and then move in with the real agenda.\u201d</p><p>Linnette hadn\u2019t thought of it that way. \u201cYou and Dad might not get along, but you\u2019re more alike than you realize.\u201d</p><p>Mack cringed. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that. The last person in the world I want to be like is my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not so bad,\u201d Linnette felt obliged to tell him. \u201cAnd neither are you. One of these days, the two of you will come to an understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Mack said doubtfully. \u201cI hope we do, but I\u2019m not holding my breath.\u201d</p><p>A polite knock sounded at Linnette\u2019s door. Lucky was suddenly alert; she gave one brief bark and stared intently.</p><p>Brother and sister glanced at each other, and then Linnette went to the door. A woman, dressed in a brown sheriff\u2019s uniform, stood on the other side, holding a small pot of bronze chrysanthemums.</p><p>\u201cHello, I\u2019m your neighbor, Gloria Ashton,\u201d she said as she handed Linnette the plant.</p><p>\u201cLinnette McAfee,\u201d she said, admiring the rich color of the chrysanthemums. \u201cMom told me everyone in Cedar Cove is friendly. This is just so nice. Please come in.\u201d She stood aside so Gloria could step into her apartment. Linnette gestured toward her brother. \u201cGloria, this is my brother, Mack. Mack, this is my next-door neighbor, Gloria Ashton.\u201d</p><p>Mack released the dog\u2019s collar, then stood and offered Gloria his hand. She took a step forward and extended her own. \u201cThis is Lucky,\u201d he said. The dog waved her plumy tail, then returned to her place by the couch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m two doors down in apartment 216. I saw your brother and a couple of other guys bringing in the furniture. I thought I\u2019d stop by on my way to work and introduce myself. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt you, but I wasn\u2019t sure when I\u2019d get another opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re with the sheriff\u2019s office here?\u201d Linnette asked. Gloria stood with her feet braced slightly apart, hands on her belt. She was short, petite, dark-haired; her uniform fit as if it\u2019d been especially designed for her. The belt that held her weapon and other paraphernalia only emphasized her femininity.</p><p>Gloria shook her head in response to Linnette\u2019s question. \u201cI\u2019m with the Bremerton office. I\u2019ve been in the area a little less than a year.\u201d</p><p>Mack stared at her and narrowed his eyes, as if he was trying to place her. \u201cYou look familiar. Have I seen you somewhere before?\u201d</p><p>Gloria studied him, frowning, and then shook her head again. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve met.\u201d</p><p>Mack shrugged. \u201cI guess not. I don\u2019t visit often, but when I do I always drive the speed limit.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d Linnette snickered and her brother elbowed her in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t live in Cedar Cove?\u201d Gloria asked.</p><p>\u201cToo close to family,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThey cramp my style.\u201d He laughed at his own weak joke and sat down.</p><p>\u201cCould you join us for a few minutes?\u201d Linnette asked. \u201cI apologize\u2014I can\u2019t offer you anything to drink. I haven\u2019t been to the grocery store yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to go, but thanks, anyway.\u201d Gloria checked her watch. \u201cI thought this would be a good time to welcome you to the complex. If you have any questions about the town, I\u2019ll be happy to try and answer them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be great,\u201d Linnette told her. \u201cI\u2019ll definitely take you up on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you do.\u201d After a few parting words, Gloria was gone.</p><p>Linnette waited until the door closed before she turned on her brother. \u201cHave I seen you somewhere before?\u201d Linnette mimicked. \u201cHonestly, Mack, that\u2019s the oldest pickup line in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to pick her up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMack, you couldn\u2019t have been more obvious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she is cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. You\u2019re so lame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? This is the thanks I get for giving up an entire Saturday to help my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re right. Sorry. If you\u2019re interested in Gloria, let me know and I\u2019ll see what I can do to set you up\u2014since you\u2019re currently footloose and fancy-free.\u201d</p><p>Mack raised his shoulders in a shrug. \u201cSure. But the truth is, she does look familiar.\u201d</p> <p>Twelve</p><p>Saturday night, Allison Cox was roused from a sound sleep by a tap on her bedroom window. Her clock told her it was almost three. She turned on the small light on her bed stand, tossed aside her down comforter and hurried to the window. Opening the blinds, she peered outside and gasped when Anson smiled at her.</p><p>\u201cLet me in,\u201d he mouthed.</p><p>She\u2019d be in big trouble if her parents ever found out about this. Although the temptation was almost overpowering, she shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He nodded vigorously and rubbed his bare hands together. Then he hunched his shoulders, as if to ward off the wind. His eyes pleaded with her.</p><p>\u201cAnson, no.\u201d She shook her head again, trying to convince herself.</p><p>He paused, waited a moment and then turned around, not hiding his disappointment.</p><p>His willingness to walk away was her undoing. He\u2019d been so good to her, so gentle and sweet. The first time they\u2019d kissed, his goatee had bothered her and the next time she saw him, he\u2019d shaved it off. Allison had been moved by his thoughtfulness. He cared about her more than any other guy ever had. In fact, she liked him a lot\u2014more than she should. Her parents had no idea how often they saw each other because she hid their relationship as much as she could. Even Cecilia had voiced her concern about Anson, and she hadn\u2019t even met him. But Allison knew he wasn\u2019t what he appeared to be. The clothes and attitude were all for show.</p> <p>Twice now he\u2019d come over in the evenings, and he\u2019d been respectful to her mother and father. That had earned him brownie points with her dad.</p><p>\u201cOh, all right,\u201d she acquiesced and grabbed her housecoat. She threw it over her pajamas, then slid open the window. Leaving him out in the cold was more than she could bear.</p><p>Anson crawled into her bedroom, landing on his feet with a solid thump. Thank goodness for her plush carpet, which absorbed much of the sound. His face was red from the cold, and his lips were chapped. He wore his signature black coat, a knit cap pulled low over his ears. His hands were bare. Smiling at her in the dim room, he let his eyes soften and leaned toward her, his mouth shaping hers in a long, hungry kiss. His face felt chilled and his lips, too.</p><p>Allison broke off the kiss and clutched her housecoat tighter around her. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she asked in an urgent whisper. \u201cDo you know what time it is?\u201d</p><p>Anson sat on the carpet, his back against the side of the bed. Allison knelt beside him. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt was wrong, I know, but...\u201d He looked down, unable to meet her gaze.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right,\u201d she said and reached for his hands, warming them between her own. His coat had a peculiar smell. It was as if he\u2019d been standing next to a bonfire and the smoke had clung to him. \u201cWhat are you doing out at this time of night?\u201d</p><p>He kept his head lowered. \u201cI can\u2019t involve you in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what, Anson? You can\u2019t involve me in what?\u201d She touched his face, pressing her warm palm to his cheek and was shocked again at how cold his skin was.</p><p>Anson covered her hand with his own, then slowly raised his eyes to meet hers. He slid his hand to the nape of her neck and brought her mouth back to his. His kiss was demanding, desperate.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do this here...now,\u201d she said, as quietly as she could. It would be easy to let him keep touching her, kissing her, but her father was a light sleeper and the risk was too great. Besides, something was terribly wrong. She felt it, saw it in Anson\u2019s eyes, a wildness that frightened her\u2014and yet she didn\u2019t feel she could desert him.</p><p>Once more Anson looked down, avoiding her gaze.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d she insisted. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>His voice was barely audible. \u201cThe park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was closed. How\u2019d you get in?\u201d</p><p>His mouth twisted in a half smile. \u201cAll they have is a gate. It\u2019s easy enough to jump over that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were you with?\u201d She should\u2019ve realized a gate across the entrance wasn\u2019t going to lock anyone out, least of all Anson and his friends.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>\u201cI was alone, okay?\u201d</p><p>A siren pierced the night and Anson scrambled to his knees, crawled close to the window and peered out. \u201cAnson?\u201d Dread wormed its way into her stomach. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Again he refused to answer as he crawled back to where she knelt.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fire?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated and then nodded.</p><p>\u201cDoes it have anything to do with you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer right away. When he did, his voice trembled. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my gosh.\u201d She covered her mouth with both hands as she tried to take in what he was telling her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it. It was an accident. My mother\u2019s got some friend at the house,\u201d he said scornfully, \u201cand I can\u2019t stand to be around when she has a sleepover.\u201d He couldn\u2019t seem to look at her. \u201cThe walls between our rooms are thin. I can hear everything.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to say any more for her to understand why he had to leave.</p><p>He seemed to think Allison would be angry with him and when she wasn\u2019t, he added, \u201cI just had to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you went to the park?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s cold and I didn\u2019t know where else to go.\u201d</p><p>Everything began to add up. \u201cYou...started a fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was looking for a way to keep warm.\u201d He rubbed his hand down his face. \u201cI thought I\u2019d make a campfire, you know, but I\u2019m no Boy Scout. I must\u2019ve done something wrong, because the wind picked up and before I knew it the flames caught\u2014near the maintenance hut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what\u2019s on fire?\u201d</p><p>Anson bit his lower lip. \u201cThere must\u2019ve been some gasoline on the ground or something, because it practically exploded. I tried to put it out, but I couldn\u2019t. Then I got scared. The flames were too hot, so I ran. I should\u2019ve stayed, should\u2019ve found a pay phone and called the fire department. There isn\u2019t one in the park.\u201d</p><p>Allison\u2019s heart pounded hard as she wrapped her arms around his shoulders. Anson had come to her; he needed her. They talked every day and hung out at school together. She was crazy about him, but her teachers, her friends, even Cecilia, thought he was wrong for her. Her parents were leery, too, but they\u2019d let Anson come to the house for dinner twice. She and Anson even went to the library and studied together. Allison didn\u2019t believe that caring about someone this much could be wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He hung his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>In that case, she did. \u201cI\u2019m going to wake up my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d His response was automatic.</p><p>\u201cMy dad will know what to do,\u201d she argued. \u201cHe won\u2019t come down on you if you\u2019re honest with him. He\u2019s fair, Anson.\u201d</p><p>He still looked uncertain. \u201cMaybe...maybe that fire wasn\u2019t as much of an accident as I said.\u201d</p><p>Shocked, Allison sat back on her heels. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He glanced away and she saw that his hands had started to tremble. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for it to get out of control like that,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou set the shed on fire on purpose? You mean it wasn\u2019t an accident?\u201d</p><p>His nod was barely perceptible. \u201cYour dad will want to take me to the sheriff\u2019s office. Allison, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m almost eighteen. The prosecutor might decide to try me as an adult.\u201d</p><p>A sick feeling invaded the pit of her stomach, but she\u2019d learned that the best way to attack a problem was head-on. She didn\u2019t have any reassurances to give him. \u201cThey might, but I\u2019ll be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad won\u2019t let you have anything to do with me if I tell him what I did.\u201d</p><p>Allison already knew this was a risk. \u201cI know, but that\u2019s a chance we have to take. My dad\u2019s fair and he\u2019ll respect you for being honest. He\u2019ll do what he can to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he?\u201d</p><p>Allison straightened her shoulders and brought her hand to his cheek. \u201cBecause his daughter cares what happens to you.\u201d</p><p>Anson\u2019s eyes locked onto hers. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot.\u201d Allison\u2019s heart swelled with the intensity of her emotions.</p><p>At her words, her touch, Anson\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever really cared about me before,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI care.\u201d And to prove how much, she leaned forward and kissed him. He smiled tentatively when she lifted her lips from his. Taking him by the hand, she led him out of her bedroom and into the kitchen. By the light of the moon, which shone coldly through the window, she urged him into a chair, instructing him to wait there while she woke her father.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure about this?\u201d</p><p>Allison wasn\u2019t sure of anything, but she trusted her father. He\u2019d know what to do and how best to help Anson. She had no other alternative.</p><p>Her dad was sitting up in bed even before Allison reached her parents\u2019 door. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d he asked. Her mother slept contentedly at his side, undisturbed.</p><p>\u201cAnson needs your help,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNow? In the middle of the night?\u201d</p><p>She met his stare as he folded back the covers. \u201cI trust you to do the right thing, Dad,\u201d she told him, her voice shaking. That was all she would say. All she could do was pray he didn\u2019t disappoint her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thirteen</p><p>\u201cThis is such a treat,\u201d Maryellen said, slipping into the booth across from her mother at the Wok and Roll, her favorite Chinese restaurant.</p><p>\u201cJust consider it an early birthday gift,\u201d Grace replied as she glanced up from the menu.</p><p>\u201cSo, how are things with you and Cliff?\u201d Maryellen asked. She didn\u2019t bother with the menu because she ordered the same thing every time. She really should try something other than the chicken hot sauce noodles, but couldn\u2019t make herself do it. The small family-owned restaurant ordered the thick rice noodles from the International District in Seattle. Maryellen could slurp up those noodles every day, she enjoyed them so much.</p> <p>Her mother set aside the menu and there was such a depressed look on her face that Maryellen was shocked. \u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>Smiling was clearly an effort. \u201cI\u2019ve given up on Cliff,\u201d Grace said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d Maryellen reached across the table and squeezed her mother\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cI do. In reality, I don\u2019t have any choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Maryellen couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cI thought you were going to fight for him. What happened?\u201d</p> <p>Grace told her about the night of their big dinner date. She\u2019d since learned from the veterinarian, who\u2019d come into the library, that Midnight had survived. Hearing this from someone other than Cliff only seemed to increase her mother\u2019s discontent with the on-again/off-again relationship.</p><p>Maryellen understood Grace\u2019s frustration. Her mother had been so hopeful about this dinner; it was going to be a new beginning for her and Cliff. And then the evening had turned out to be such a disappointment.</p><p>\u201cIt was more than Cliff dealing with Midnight. I understand the stallion was in a life-threatening situation. That I could have accepted. But Cliff had obviously forgotten he\u2019d even asked me out to the ranch. He seemed so...indifferent. My being there meant nothing to him. In fact, he seemed grateful to get out of having dinner with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff\u2019s not like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNormally I\u2019d agree with you,\u201d her mother said, \u201cbut I was there, Maryellen. I\u2019ve learned to trust my instincts and that was the way I felt. Much as I don\u2019t want to believe it, I know I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen hated to see this relationship end, especially since Grace had worked so hard to win Cliff back. Until now, Maryellen had found him to be thoughtful and sensitive to her mother\u2014far more than her own father had ever been. \u201cYou mean to say that after two weeks Cliff hasn\u2019t even tried to phone?\u201d she asked, incredulous.</p> <p>Her mother shrugged. \u201cHe left messages a couple of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Maryellen looked at her sternly. \u201cDid you return his calls?\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s smile was sad. \u201cOlivia thinks I should, too, but I can\u2019t.\u201d She sighed so dejectedly that Maryellen yearned to hug her and reassure her.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Maryellen really didn\u2019t understand this.</p><p>She recognized from the stubborn way her mother shook her head that Grace wouldn\u2019t call him. \u201cOlivia says I\u2019m a fool not to, but Maryellen, you have to realize how demeaning it was, how awful I felt\u2014it\u2019s hard to explain. Sad as it is to admit, I don\u2019t think Cliff\u2019s capable of getting beyond what happened with Will.\u201d She paused; she\u2019d never told her daughters the whole story, but Maryellen had pieced it together. \u201cAs far as he\u2019s concerned, I committed the one sin he can\u2019t forgive. He\u2019d like things to be different, he might even want us to be together, but something inside him is incapable of forgiving me for what I did.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen disagreed. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. He wouldn\u2019t have phoned if that was the case.\u201d</p><p>Grace shook her head again. \u201cI\u2019m sure Cliff regrets what happened, but there\u2019s no need to drag this out any longer. I doubt he\u2019ll phone again and after some soul-searching, I\u2019ve decided that\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>Her mother might have talked herself into that decision, but Maryellen didn\u2019t believe she was fine with it at all. The very first time she\u2019d met Cliff and seen him with her mother, Maryellen had felt they were meant to be together. \u201cDo you remember when I was pregnant with Katie?\u201d Maryellen asked.</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was convinced I didn\u2019t need Jon and that I could raise the baby on my own. Remember?\u201d</p><p>A smile touched her mother\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou were so determined to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well...It was easy enough to think I could do everything by myself before Katie was born, but afterward...it was a different story.\u201d Never would she have imagined that one tiny baby could be so demanding. Most nights Maryellen had only managed to sleep in twenty-or thirty-minute stretches\u2014if at all. A rash of ear infections kept Katie up at night screaming in pain. Thankfully Jon had insisted on being part of his daughter\u2019s life and wanted to share the responsibility of raising her. Maryellen had quickly seen that Katie needed him, and so did she. \u201cThe similarity, Mom, is that I was so sure about everything\u2014and I was wrong. Maybe you are, too.\u201d</p><p>As Grace began to reply, Elaine, the owner\u2019s wife, came for their order and predictably Maryellen chose her chicken hot sauce noodles. Grace asked for Wor Wonton Soup.</p><p>When Elaine had left their table and gone back to the kitchen, the restaurant door opened and in walked Cliff Harding.</p><p>Maryellen leaned toward her mother. \u201cDon\u2019t look now, but Cliff just came in.\u201d</p><p>Grace stiffened. \u201cDid he notice us?\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t time to answer. Cliff walked directly over to their table and smiled down at both women.</p><p>\u201cHi, there,\u201d Maryellen said, raising her hand. \u201cThis is a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>He acknowledged her, and removed his Stetson as he turned toward her mother. \u201cGrace,\u201d he said with a curt nod.</p><p>\u201cHello, Cliff.\u201d Her mother\u2019s voice was calm, and she kept her eyes trained straight ahead.</p><p>Maryellen admired her poise in this awkward situation. She watched as Grace slowly glanced up and offered Cliff the scantest of smiles.</p><p>\u201cThere must be a problem with your answering machine,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get in touch with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you care to join us?\u201d Maryellen asked, ignoring the daggers her mother was shooting at her.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d</p><p>Her mother hesitated only briefly. \u201cBy all means.\u201d She looked at her watch as if to gauge how much of her lunch hour was left. \u201cI\u2019ll need to leave in a few minutes, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Maryellen challenged. \u201cWe ordered no more than three minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>Cliff sat at the end of the booth, setting his cowboy hat on the empty space next to Grace.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little early for you to be having lunch, isn\u2019t it?\u201d her mother asked pointedly.</p><p>Cliff smiled wryly. \u201cThe truth is, I drove by and saw you and Maryellen in the window. I figured if you weren\u2019t going to answer my phone calls, the best thing to do was talk to you in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorrier than you know about that night,\u201d he said with sincerity.</p><p>So Maryellen was right. Cliff knew what he\u2019d done and was trying to make amends.</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d be willing to give me another opportunity.\u201d His eyes pleaded with Grace. \u201cI\u2019d still like you to come out to the ranch for dinner,\u201d he said in a rush.</p><p>Grace seemed to waver. \u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen wanted to shake her mother. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019d enjoy that very much,\u201d she said firmly and ignored the kick as her mother\u2019s shoe connected with her shin.</p><p>Maryellen nearly laughed aloud at the shuffling of their feet beneath the table.</p><p>In the meantime, Elaine brought Cliff a teacup and a menu. He accepted the tea, but declined lunch.</p><p>The small interruption was followed by an uncomfortable silence. \u201cWhen would you like Mom to come over?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen!\u201d Her mother\u2019s protest was accompanied by a glare. \u201cI\u2019m sure Cliff has more important things to attend to than making me dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to do it,\u201d he countered, a smile twitching at the edges of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat date were you thinking of?\u201d Maryellen was finding pleasure in this. It was a fitting turnabout, considering all the times Grace had tried to match her up after her divorce. She\u2019d resented it back then, never suspecting that the day would come when she\u2019d play matchmaker for her own mother.</p><p>\u201cThanksgiving,\u201d Cliff said.</p><p>That astonished them both, and they stared at him.</p><p>\u201cThanksgiving,\u201d Grace repeated softly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I already have an invitation.\u201d She sent a triumphant look in Maryellen\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cTo my house,\u201d Maryellen said. Feeling she needed to explain the situation to Cliff, she added, \u201cKelly\u2019s going to be at her in-laws\u2019, so Mom was planning to join Jon, Katie and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you flying out to be with Lisa?\u201d Grace asked.</p><p>\u201cLisa was here earlier in the year,\u201d Cliff said, and of course Grace knew that. \u201cI thought I\u2019d stay home. I don\u2019t pretend to be much of a cook, but I can probably manage a turkey and fixings.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen watched the lowering of her mother\u2019s guard. No matter how hard Grace tried to convince herself the relationship was over, she couldn\u2019t do it. In a matter of minutes, her resolve was visibly crumbling.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the invitation,\u201d her mother said, her eyes warm with longing, \u201cbut I\u2019m already committed to my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, it\u2019s all right, really. Jon and I won\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Cliff said quickly. \u201cI was hoping Maryellen, Jon and the baby would come, too.\u201d</p><p>Grace met Maryellen\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Maryellen felt a sense of satisfaction steal over her. \u201cI\u2019ll have to check with Jon, of course, but I imagine he\u2019d enjoy the opportunity not to cook this Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll both be joining Cal and me,\u201d Cliff said, as he got to his feet. He reached for his hat and when he smiled, it seemed to Maryellen that there was a new lightness in his expression. His habitual look was one of gravity and she\u2019d rarely seen this kind of...elation on his face before.</p><p>She noticed that her mother was smiling, too.</p><p>Fourteen</p><p>The ringing of the phone destroyed the calm of the afternoon. Corrie reached for it on the second ring. \u201cRoy McAfee\u2019s office,\u201d she said in her professional voice.</p><p>The lack of response caught her attention. \u201cThis is Roy McAfee\u2019s office,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>Silence again.</p><p>Sighing, she replaced the phone. When she looked up, Roy was standing in the doorway leading to his office, his arms crossed. He glowered at the phone as if it were guilty of some unspeakable crime.</p><p>\u201cHow many hang-ups have we had in the last couple of weeks?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Corrie hadn\u2019t counted them. \u201cTwo or three,\u201d she said, but she knew it was more. She shrugged, making light of it. \u201cI think the phone company must\u2019ve issued a number similar to ours to a pizza parlor or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow many hang-ups did we get in October?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honestly, Roy, you don\u2019t expect me to remember that, do you?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I do. I don\u2019t know anyone who has a better mind for details. How many, Corrie?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cNone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you think whoever\u2019s been mailing these postcards is switching to phone calls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny more postcards recently?\u201d Corrie hated to ask, but she needed to know. She hadn\u2019t seen any, and Roy hadn\u2019t mentioned getting even one in quite a while. Still, she was afraid he might be hiding them from her\u2014for her own protection, of course.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThe last card arrived on October sixth.\u201d</p> <p>Corrie smiled, not that she found it humorous. She did feel a little relieved, yes. But her amusement, such as it was, came from Roy\u2019s claim that she had a head for details, although he was the one who categorized every fact, no matter how minute. If it hadn\u2019t been for Roy, the murder at the Thyme and Tide might never have been solved. Little things like the date of the last postcard stayed in his mind\u2014and hers, too. Nothing, however, had been as troubling as this.</p><p>The phone rang again. Corrie looked at Roy before answering on the second ring. \u201cRoy McAfee\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Linnette cried, \u201cwhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ceremony for the clinic opening starts in fifteen minutes! I thought you were coming.\u201d</p><p>Corrie nearly laughed out loud. Only seconds earlier, she\u2019d been congratulating herself and Roy on their memories, and they\u2019d let the most important day of the month slip past them.</p> <p>\u201cDad and I will be there in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurry! You wouldn\u2019t believe all the people who are here. Besides, I want to introduce you to Dr. Timmons. Oh, Mom, he\u2019s just so cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re on our way now,\u201d Corrie said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even think of driving. There isn\u2019t a parking spot to be had for miles.\u201d</p><p>Corrie loved the joy and excitement in her daughter\u2019s voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right over.\u201d</p><p>Roy must\u2019ve heard, because he\u2019d already collected his jacket. He held Corrie\u2019s long wool coat for her. When she\u2019d pulled on her gloves and wrapped a hand-knit scarf around her neck, they walked out the door. Roy automatically stopped to check that it was locked.</p><p>The brisk cold wind off the cove was powerful enough to make Corrie\u2019s eyes water. She shivered and Roy tucked her hand in the crook of his arm as they set off at a brisk pace toward the newly constructed clinic across from City Hall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Linnette\u2019s living in Cedar Cove now,\u201d Roy murmured, surprising her. He didn\u2019t generally reveal his emotions; he was the kind of man who showed his love through the things he did, not the things he said. Corrie was pleased he had a good relationship with Linnette. But that reminded her of his conflicts with their son, which immediately saddened her.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad she\u2019s here, too.\u201d Corrie was more than glad, she was thrilled. Ecstatic. She just wished Mack and Roy would sort out their differences. She resisted the urge to remind her husband that Mack had helped his sister move from Seattle to Cedar Cove. Roy would see through that conversational ploy instantly.</p><p>By the time Corrie and Roy arrived at the medical complex, there was a crowd, just as Linnette had said, with more people gathering in front of the big red ribbon stretched across the sidewalk. Corrie spotted Mayor Benson with several other members of the council.</p><p>Charlotte and Ben Rhodes were there. That was fitting because it was through their determined efforts that Cedar Cove had a medical facility at all. Jack Griffin and a photographer from The Chronicle were interviewing a group of older people, while the sheriff and his deputies scanned the crowd.</p><p>Linnette smiled and waved when she saw Corrie and Roy. She motioned with her head at the good-looking man standing on her right. This must be Chad Timmons, the physician she\u2019d mentioned countless times.</p><p>A small podium had been erected and Mayor Benson finally stepped up to the microphone. \u201cWelcome, welcome,\u201d he called out, and a hush fell over the crowd. \u201cI\u2019m delighted to see such a large turnout for this afternoon\u2019s grand opening of Cedar Cove\u2019s brand-spanking-new medical facility.\u201d</p><p>Corrie was almost deafened by the resounding cheer that followed. \u201cThis has come about as a result of the cooperation between the private and public sectors. I\u2019m proud to have played a role in getting this facility off the drawing board.\u201d</p><p>Corrie glanced at her husband and saw that he was having a hard time squelching a smile. \u201cThe old windbag should be thanking Charlotte and Ben,\u201d he said, bending down to whisper in her ear.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Corrie whispered back. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the one who risked jail time.\u201d</p><p>Mayor Benson gestured expansively. \u201cNow, I\u2019d like to introduce our staff members.\u201d Several other men and women had joined Linnette and Dr. Timmons, and the mayor briefly introduced each one. When Linnette\u2019s name was announced, she gave a small wave. Corrie clapped as loudly as her gloved hands would allow.</p><p>After the introduction of the staff, Mayor Benson continued to elaborate on the role his office had played in establishing the clinic.</p><p>\u201cJust cut the ribbon,\u201d someone shouted from the back of the crowd when rain started to fall.</p><p>Mayor Benson reached for the big scissors. \u201cNormally it\u2019s my privilege, as mayor of Cedar Cove, to cut the ribbon, but I\u2019d like to defer in this instance.\u201d He turned to Charlotte and Ben. \u201cMr. and Mrs. Rhodes, would you kindly do the honors?\u201d</p><p>The crowd roared with approval.</p><p>Blushing, Charlotte stepped forward and with Ben at her side, cut the ribbon.</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019d like everyone to come in for a tour of the facility. And please, help yourself to refreshments.\u201d</p><p>The small podium was quickly moved and the double glass doors opened wide as a stream of visitors flowed in.</p><p>Corrie and Roy paused to chat with friends along the way. Jack\u2019s photographer took dozens of pictures, but Corrie was sure the photograph on the front page would be of Charlotte and Ben cutting the ribbon. She had to give the mayor credit. He was a savvy politician to surrender the honor to Charlotte and Ben Rhodes. That had probably earned him more votes than anything he might have said.</p><p>Corrie chatted with Peggy Beldon while she waited for the crowd to diminish so she could talk to her daughter. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Gloria Ashton, Linnette\u2019s neighbor, deep in conversation with Dr. Timmons. She\u2019d recently met her when she\u2019d visited Linnette to drop off a casserole. Corrie noticed the way Linnette\u2019s gaze followed her newfound friend, as if sizing up the competition. Oh, dear. That could be a problem. Although Corrie had only met Gloria the one time, she\u2019d liked her and hoped that Linnette and her neighbor would become good friends.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Roy asked, nodding toward Gloria.</p><p>Linnette had walked over to Gloria and Dr. Timmons and joined in the conversation. Corrie saw Dr. Timmons\u2019s quick frown, as if he resented the intrusion. This definitely wasn\u2019t a good sign.</p><p>\u201cDo you know her?\u201d Roy asked again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Linnette\u2019s neighbor. She works for the sheriff\u2019s office in Bremerton.\u201d</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cWhat makes you ask?\u201d she prodded.</p><p>\u201cNo reason.\u201d</p><p>Roy was probably thinking the same thing as Corrie. Their daughter had a major crush on this doctor. Corrie couldn\u2019t remember hearing Linnette more excited than the day she\u2019d learned the clinic had hired Chad Timmons.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Corrie said, taking her husband\u2019s hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go talk to Linnette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute,\u201d Roy said, frowning as he watched his daughter interact with the small group. \u201cWhat do you know about this guy she\u2019s so keen on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what she told me. Roy, good grief, give the girl a chance. She\u2019s got a mind of her own and she isn\u2019t going to appreciate your interference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Roy teased.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Roy smiled again. \u201cHow\u2019d her date go with that bachelor you paid top dollar for?\u201d</p><p>His comment hit its mark. \u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d she murmured. The dinner was a major disappointment in Corrie\u2019s view. Apparently Linnette\u2019s evening had been enjoyable enough; in fact, according to her daughter, it\u2019d been a better experience than she\u2019d expected. But as far as Corrie knew, Cal Washburn hadn\u2019t phoned her for a second date. Sadly, she wasn\u2019t entirely convinced Linnette would accept if he did.</p><p>\u201cThen I guess we should make this young doctor\u2019s acquaintance.\u201d With his hand at the small of her back, Roy steered Corrie toward the group.</p><p>The three stopped chatting when Corrie and Roy approached. \u201cMom, Dad,\u201d Linnette said, smiling broadly. All that was missing was a trumpet fanfare. \u201cThis is Dr. Timmons.\u201d</p><p>The physician exchanged handshakes with Roy and Corrie. \u201cPleased to meet you,\u201d he said politely.</p><p>\u201cI think Linnette\u2019s mentioned your name,\u201d Corrie told him, downplaying her daughter\u2019s interest. \u201cDid you attend classes together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Chad said. \u201cWe met at the hospital where Linnette did her practical training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is Gloria Ashton,\u201d Linnette inserted, smiling at her father. \u201cWe live in the same apartment complex. Gloria, meet my dad, Roy McAfee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure,\u201d Roy said.</p><p>Gloria nodded. \u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>After a moment\u2019s silence, Dr. Timmons said, \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019d better do some more mingling.\u201d He grinned at Gloria. \u201cI\u2019d be interested in following up on our conversation,\u201d he said, then glanced self-consciously at Linnette. \u201cCould I give you a call sometime?\u201d</p><p>His question went unanswered and there was an uncomfortable silence.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014yes, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Gloria said. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>Linnette\u2019s face fell, but she recovered quickly. With a strained smile, she ushered her parents toward the interior of the clinic. \u201cCome on, Mom and Dad. I\u2019ll give you a personal tour.\u201d</p><p>Corrie wasn\u2019t fooled. She could sense trouble brewing between Linnette and her new friend over the handsome Dr. Timmons.</p><p>Fifteen</p><p>Cecilia liked Rachel Pendergast right away. They talked for a few minutes before the beautician seated her and draped the plastic cape around her. Rachel had a friendly, down-to-earth manner that Cecilia found appealing. Ian had suggested she introduce herself to Warrant Officer Nate Olsen\u2019s girlfriend, so she\u2019d scheduled an appointment. Cecilia was due for a haircut, anyway, and wasn\u2019t opposed to trying out a new shop, especially one with such a good reputation.</p><p>Rachel turned the chair around so Cecilia faced the mirror. She combed through Cecilia\u2019s thick hair and ran her fingers from beginning to end. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow much would you like cut off?\u201d she asked, meeting Cecilia\u2019s gaze in the mirror.</p><p>\u201cAbout an inch,\u201d she said, \u201cand I\u2019d like you to trim my bangs.\u201d Cecilia guessed she and Rachel were close to the same age; perhaps Rachel was a few years older. It was hard to tell.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s your baby due?\u201d Rachel asked, leading Cecilia to the shampoo sink.</p><p>\u201cMarch fifteenth.\u201d The date was embossed in her mind as she mentally counted the days before she would hold her son in her arms.</p> <p>\u201cIs this your first baby?\u201d Rachel asked conversationally.</p><p>Cecilia hesitated. The question always stopped her cold. And it was always accompanied by pain as she faced the memory of losing Allison. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, trying to speak normally. \u201cOur daughter died shortly after she was born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Rachel placed a comforting hand on Cecilia\u2019s shoulder and squeezed gently.</p><p>Not wanting the other woman to think she\u2019d taken offense, Cecilia offered her a reassuring smile. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s a question I get asked often enough. You\u2019d think I\u2019d have a standard response by now. I should.\u201d Except Cecilia didn\u2019t know what that response should be. \u201cIt\u2019d be easier to tell everyone this is our first baby, I suppose,\u201d she said, thinking out loud, \u201cbut I can\u2019t make myself do it. Allison was part of me and Ian, and I refuse to pretend she never lived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said exactly the right thing,\u201d Rachel told her. She busied herself by turning on the water and leaning Cecilia back so that her neck rested in the curve of the shampoo bowl.</p> <p>Rachel worked the shampoo into Cecilia\u2019s wet hair with strong fingers, massaging her scalp. Her touch relaxed Cecilia as she lathered her hair, rinsed and then repeated the process.</p><p>By the time Rachel had washed out the cream rinse and placed a towel over her head, Cecilia had started to consider having her hair cut much shorter than she\u2019d been wearing it. Over the years she\u2019d had it styled a number of ways. Ian, however, preferred her hair shoulder-length, so that was how she kept it. Maybe she could have two inches cut off\u2014make the change in increments.</p><p>\u201cYou have wonderful hair,\u201d Rachel commented as she guided Cecilia back to her station.</p><p>\u201cIt must be the vitamins,\u201d Cecilia said lightly. \u201cThe only times I\u2019ve had hair and fingernails like this are when I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Rachel directed Cecilia into the chair. She combed out and sectioned her hair, twisting each section and securing it with a clip. \u201cDo you know if you\u2019re having a boy or a girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoy,\u201d Cecilia said, smiling at the thought of her husband\u2019s happiness when she\u2019d told him what she\u2019d learned. \u201cThe first ultrasound said a girl, but in the most recent one, the baby looked very much like a little boy. I know Ian will be thrilled with either\u2014I will, too.\u201d She rested her hand on her stomach, already loving this baby so much. She wanted the pregnancy to be perfect, her child to be healthy, and was doing everything she could to ensure that.</p> <p>They chatted while Rachel expertly cut her hair, going a little shorter than Cecilia had originally requested. Her hair would just touch her shoulders. \u201cSince you\u2019re a first-time customer, can you tell me who referred you?\u201d she asked, clipping away. \u201cI like to thank the person who gave me the referral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be difficult. My husband\u2019s the one who suggested I make an appointment with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Rachel paused as if trying to recall which of her male customers was married to Cecilia.</p><p>\u201cApparently, my husband is a friend of a friend of yours,\u201d Cecilia clarified. \u201cI understand Ian and\u2014I think Ian said his name\u2019s Nate\u2014are on the George Washington together.\u201d</p><p>Excitement lit Rachel\u2019s eyes. \u201cYour husband\u2019s in the Navy?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia nodded.</p><p>\u201cDid he have any news about Nate?\u201d There was no disguising Rachel\u2019s exhilaration now. \u201cWe write to each other, but the letters take so long, and I haven\u2019t heard from him in over a week. Everything\u2019s okay, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.... The last I heard, everything was going well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d Rachel smiled in obvious relief. \u201cI\u2019ve only known Nate for a few months,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cShe paid good money for him, too.\u201d This comment came from the dark-haired, slightly overweight woman in the station next to Rachel\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cTeri,\u201d Rachel said, scowling at her friend.</p><p>\u201cYou...paid for him?\u201d Cecilia asked, intrigued.</p><p>\u201cIn a manner of speaking, yes...\u201d</p><p>She was about to continue when Teri cut her off. \u201cShe bought him at the Dog and Bachelor Auction in July.\u201d Having said that, the other beautician turned back to her customer.</p><p>\u201cRach was the only one of us who plunked down her hard-earned cash for a man,\u201d the beautician across from Rachel said. \u201cThe guys were out of my price league.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine, too,\u201d Teri added.</p><p>\u201cFor that matter, he was out of mine,\u201d Rachel told her.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you bid on him?\u201d Cecilia asked curiously. She remembered reading an article about the auction in The Cedar Cove Chronicle. The piece had stated that the Dog and Bachelor Auction was by far the most successful fund-raising activity ever put on by the Animal Shelter. Cecilia thought it was certainly innovative.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say exactly what appealed to me about Nate,\u201d Rachel confessed. \u201cHe was one of the last bachelors available and not a single one of us girls had bought one yet.\u201d She paused. \u201cAlthough a girlfriend of mine did get a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all had high hopes for this event,\u201d Teri said. \u201cWe went thinking this might be a good way to meet men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we wanted to support the shelter,\u201d another girl chimed in. \u201cWe\u2019re all big animal-lovers here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to be working out for Rach,\u201d a young woman with spiked hair said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind admitting it was the best money I\u2019ve spent in ages,\u201d Rachel agreed.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Teri placed one hand on her hip. \u201cThen why are you still dating Bruce Payton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t dating,\u201d Rachel insisted, lowering her voice. \u201cWe really aren\u2019t,\u201d she told Cecilia. \u201cBruce is a widower and we sort of keep each other company now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJolene wants you to be her mom.\u201d Teri said this in a singsong voice as if she were forecasting trouble.</p><p>Rachel exhaled slowly. \u201cI know, and that\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><p>Confused, Cecilia glanced from one woman to the other. \u201cJolene is Bruce\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Rachel nodded. \u201cShe misses her mother. I try to do girl things with her. Bruce appreciates that, and Jolene and I have gotten to be close in the last couple of years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re interested in Nate?\u201d Cecilia wanted to be clear on that.</p><p>\u201cVery much.\u201d Rachel didn\u2019t bother to disguise her feelings for him.</p><p>\u201cI gather he feels the same way about you,\u201d Cecilia was happy to report. \u201cLike I said, my husband suggested I get in touch with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d Happiness radiated from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cUm...does Nate know you\u2019re seeing Bruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014no, but Bruce and I aren\u2019t actually seeing each other in the dating sense. We just do things together, mainly for the company. And for Jolene. There\u2019s nothing romantic between us.\u201d She hesitated for a moment. \u201cAt least on my end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Bruce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak for him, but...sometimes I think he\u2019d like the relationship to be more than it is. Please understand, I don\u2019t encourage him,\u201d Rachel said, looking a bit uncomfortable to be saying even this much. \u201cI haven\u2019t said anything to Nate about Bruce, because\u2014well, because it just isn\u2019t important enough to mention.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia understood perfectly. She believed in honesty between husband and wife, but there were some things best left unsaid. Some things that were just too hard to explain. Especially when communication was limited.</p><p>\u201cI felt terrible when I missed a phone call from Nate. I was with Jolene and had my cell turned off. We must\u2019ve been in the movie theater and then I got a message that he\u2019d called. I was sick about that. Apparently he only got one chance and he wasted his.\u201d Rachel\u2019s disappointment echoed in each word.</p><p>\u201cIan said you don\u2019t have a computer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Rachel said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m a real dunce when it comes to anything technological.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be willing to help you learn,\u201d Cecilia offered. \u201cIan asked me to get you up and running. The request is actually from Nate because he wants to talk to you on-line. Once you\u2019re familiar with how it works, you can use one of the computers at the library. That\u2019s what Ian and I did until we could afford our own. You\u2019d be surprised how easy it is.\u201d</p><p>Rachel beamed. \u201cThank you\u2014I really appreciate this. By the way...did your husband mention that I\u2019m a few years older than Nate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it didn\u2019t sound as if Nate cared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I guess he doesn\u2019t. I think about it sometimes and then I remember\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat she remembers,\u201d Teri inserted, \u201cis that Nate is one hell of a kisser.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia watched as Rachel\u2019s face grew pink. \u201cThis is the problem when you work with a group of women,\u201d she muttered, glaring across her station at Teri. \u201cThey don\u2019t know the meaning of the word discretion.\u201d</p><p>Teri laughed outright. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen Rachel blush before\u2014except when she told us about the night she and Nate sat on the beach until the wee hours of the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate was leaving that day,\u201d Rachel added for Cecilia\u2019s benefit.</p><p>Cecilia understood the need to be close for as long as possible. It happened with her and Ian every time he was due to ship out.</p><p>\u201cThere are a few of us Navy wives who have a small support group. You\u2019d be welcome to stop by the next evening we meet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would, but I\u2019m not a Navy wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could be,\u201d Teri said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d love to have you,\u201d Cecilia assured Rachel. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when we\u2019re planning to get together. Why don\u2019t you come to my apartment first so I can show you how to send Nate an e-mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Rachel whispered. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled about this.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia felt good about it herself. Not only that, her hair looked beautiful\u2014smooth and glossy\u2014and when she went to pay, Rachel told her it was on the house.</p><p>Sixteen</p><p>Grace didn\u2019t expect anything to come of this Thanksgiving dinner at Cliff\u2019s. When he\u2019d joined her and Maryellen at the Chinese restaurant, he\u2019d seemed genuine about wanting another chance, but she couldn\u2019t allow herself to believe there was hope for them. Couldn\u2019t risk another bout of disappointment. It was with this thought in mind that she drove to meet her daughter\u2019s family on Thanksgiving morning. They would all arrive at Cliff\u2019s house together. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Maryellen was certainly in high spirits, Grace noted as her daughter let her in. She loved Maryellen and Jon\u2019s home, which was built in a Northwest style and only a few miles from Cliff\u2019s property. With each visit, she marveled at Jon\u2019s ingenuity and skill. While he developed his artistic career, handling the management aspect as well as the photography itself, he also worked on his house and its grounds. Each and every day Grace was grateful her daughter had met Jon Bowman\u2014and that she\u2019d married him.</p><p>Katie took one look at her grandma and gleefully waddled toward her, small arms held wide.</p><p>Without hesitation, Grace squatted down and scooped her up, to cries of delight. \u201cHow\u2019s my Katie-girl?\u201d she asked, nuzzling the toddler\u2019s face.</p><p>Katie squealed and hugged her back, both arms locked around Grace\u2019s neck.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re ready, Mom,\u201d Maryellen said. She opened the refrigerator and took out a molded salad. It was a recipe that had been in the family for years, made from lime gelatin, cream cheese and melted marshmallows. Grace had always associated it with Thanksgiving dinner and apparently so did her daughter.</p><p>\u201cI made salad,\u201d Maryellen said unnecessarily. \u201cAnd Jon baked an apple pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI baked a pumpkin pie,\u201d Grace told her.</p><p>Maryellen laughed. \u201cCliff said we didn\u2019t have to bring a thing. It seems we decided he needed a little help, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s willing to prepare an entire turkey dinner by himself,\u201d Grace said, impressed that Cliff was taking this on. As far as she knew, he usually settled for sandwiches, canned soup or a simple grilled steak.</p> <p>\u201cMother, you don\u2019t honestly think Cliff is going to cook, do you?\u201d Maryellen looked at her incredulously.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said. Didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all these restaurants and grocery stores offering to provide an entire meal for a reasonable price?\u201d As if she\u2019d suddenly remembered something, she turned to her mother. \u201cWhat are Olivia and Jack doing for Thanksgiving?\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled. \u201cHow did we get from store-bought turkey dinners to the subject of Olivia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy way of Justine, of course.\u201d</p><p>Ah yes, it made sense now. Restaurants provided turkey dinners, and Justine and Seth owned The Lighthouse restaurant.</p> <p>\u201cOlivia and Jack went to Reno to be with Eric, Shelley and the twins,\u201d Grace explained, referring to Jack\u2019s son from his first marriage. According to Olivia, everyone was excited about the trip. They\u2019d flown out on Wednesday evening\u2014the night of the aerobics class Olivia and Grace usually attended. It was the first one Olivia had missed in months. Grace felt guilty for not going, but without the motivation of meeting her best friend, she\u2019d ended up staying home. If not for Olivia, Grace would have given up on the class years ago. Her knees often hurt afterward and any benefit she gained from repeatedly leaping up and down was wiped out by the pie and coffee they had after class.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, I seem to remember that you mentioned Olivia had plans,\u201d Maryellen said absently as Jon loaded the car. When everything was inside, including the portable high chair, he placed a bundled-up Katie in her car seat.</p><p>Grace sat in the back next to her granddaughter. Katie was a sweet child, with huge expressive eyes. She was talking now, gibberish mostly, but she seemed to enjoy carrying on long, one-sided conversations.</p><p>Grace couldn\u2019t help feeling bad that Jon\u2019s stepmother was missing out on all the stages of Katie\u2019s development. Grace knew it saddened Maryellen, but Jon had been unwilling to compromise in his attitude toward his parents\u2014even when he\u2019d learned of his father\u2019s stroke.</p><p>Katie was the Bowmans\u2019 only grandchild, and they\u2019d never even seen her, except in the photographs Maryellen had surreptitiously sent. It broke Grace\u2019s heart.</p><p>Cliff was standing in the open doorway when Jon pulled into the yard. A light rain had just begun, and he hurried out to the car to usher Grace into the house, returning to carry in some of Katie\u2019s paraphernalia.</p><p>Despite Maryellen\u2019s predictions, Grace expected to be greeted by the wonderful aroma of turkey and sage; she wasn\u2019t so much disappointed as amused when there was no such smell. A fire crackled in the fireplace and the house was warm and inviting, but Cliff was quite clearly taking advantage of a precooked Thanksgiving dinner.</p><p>While Maryellen and Jon got Katie out of her jacket and settled with some blocks and a teddy bear, Grace found Cal in the kitchen. He stood by the counter making a pot of coffee. He smiled when he saw Grace. \u201cHappppp-y Thanks...Turkey Day,\u201d he managed.</p> <p>\u201cYou, too, Cal.\u201d Grace admired the young man and liked him. \u201cSpeaking of turkey and turkey day,\u201d she said, glancing around. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look\u2014or smell\u2014like there\u2019s much cooking going on around here.\u201d</p><p>Cliff stepped into the room behind her. \u201cGuilty as charged. Cal and I opted for culinary assistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lighthouse?\u201d Jon asked, joining them.</p><p>Cliff nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re providing a full meal\u2014and they\u2019re going to deliver it, ready to go.\u201d He checked his watch. \u201cAnytime,\u201d he added.</p><p>No sooner were the words out of his mouth than the doorbell rang. Cal went to answer it, and both Seth and Justine walked in, carrying their dinner. Seth held the aluminum foil roasting pan with the turkey and Justine had two large bags. They set their bounty on the kitchen counter.</p><p>\u201cNeed help?\u201d Cal asked.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more in the car,\u201d Justine said, throwing off the hood of her rainproof jacket.</p><p>\u201cLet-t-t me.\u201d Cal disappeared to collect the remaining food.</p><p>Justine slipped her arm around her husband\u2019s waist. Seth was a big fisherman with a robust physique and hair so blond it was almost white. A few years ago, when the local fishing industry fell on troubled times, he\u2019d taken his savings and Justine\u2019s business sense and built The Lighthouse restaurant.</p><p>\u201cThis is our last stop,\u201d Justine explained. \u201cSeth and I decided to make this delivery ourselves so we could wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you off to next?\u201d Maryellen asked. \u201cThere\u2019s enough here to feed an army. We\u2019d love it if you joined us,\u201d she suggested, looking to Cliff for confirmation.</p><p>\u201cWe certainly would,\u201d Cliff said.</p><p>\u201cSeth\u2019s family is waiting for us,\u201d Justine told them. \u201cBut thanks for the invite.\u201d She smiled as Cal came in with another two bags. \u201cAnd thanks, Cal, for getting those.\u201d</p><p>Within minutes they were out the door and on their way.</p><p>Cliff and Cal set the table while Grace and Maryellen arranged the feast on platters and in serving bowls. Christmas music played softly in the background, coming from a Seattle radio station. The mood was festive and joyful as they gathered around the table.</p><p>Grace sat beside Cliff and across from Cal. When they all bowed their heads to say grace, Cliff reached for her hand as he whispered a simple heartfelt prayer. The sincerity of his words touched her. She had much to be thankful for. Three years ago, on her first Thanksgiving without Dan, she\u2019d battled depression and loneliness as she and Maryellen struggled to make the best of a painful situation. Now her daughter was married, with a family of her own. And Grace had grown in ways she\u2019d never expected. After a difficult time, she\u2019d been able to accept Dan\u2019s death, to find a measure of peace with it. She\u2019d begun to reinvent her life\u2014and Cliff had been part of that process.</p><p>There was a lot of joking and laughter as they served themselves, passing bowls and platters around the table. It felt, Grace thought, as if they were all part of the same family.</p><p>\u201cI think we should each give thanks for one thing,\u201d Maryellen suggested. \u201cLet\u2019s take a minute to do that.\u201d She cast her eyes down at the pristine linen tablecloth. \u201cI know I\u2019m grateful for so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am, too,\u201d Cliff said. He took Grace\u2019s hand again and smiled at her. \u201cI\u2019m most thankful that Grace is with me today. I\u2019m hoping we can spend more time together in the weeks and months to come.\u201d</p><p>Grace bit her lip to keep the emotion at bay. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYour turn, Mother.\u201d</p><p>Still holding Cliff\u2019s hand, Grace looked around the table. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for my family and friends and\u2014\u201d she paused, swallowing hard \u201c\u2014for this time with Cliff.\u201d She\u2019d thought the relationship was over and now hope had been revived. Hope that they\u2019d be able to see past their mistakes and move toward a future together.</p><p>Seeming to understand, Cliff squeezed her hand. For a long moment, his eyes held hers.</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d Jon said, gesturing toward Maryellen.</p><p>Maryellen waited until she had everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cToday I\u2019m most grateful for the new life growing inside me.\u201d</p><p>Shocked, Grace dropped her fork. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen\u2019s eyes were glistening. \u201cI found out last week. I can\u2019t tell you how hard it was not to say anything until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryellen?\u201d Jon whispered hoarsely. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant? But I thought...is it safe so soon?\u201d</p><p>Grace knew he was referring to the fact that she\u2019d so recently miscarried. Another pregnancy this close to the last one clearly worried him. It concerned Grace, too, but she wouldn\u2019t say anything to diminish her daughter\u2019s happiness.</p><p>Maryellen merely nodded. \u201cI feel fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI really do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d Cliff said, motioning to her husband at the other end of the table.</p><p>For a moment he seemed incapable of responding. He kept his eyes focused on Maryellen. \u201cI\u2019m most grateful for my wife,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>As if to protest being left out, Katie banged the high chair with her cup, making a loud noise.</p><p>\u201cAnd Katie,\u201d he added, to the accompaniment of delighted laughter.</p><p>After dinner Jon tracked down Grace, alone in the kitchen as she wrapped leftovers. Cliff and Cal had gone to the barn to take care of some afternoon chores. He didn\u2019t waste time leading up to the subject. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean that Maryellen\u2019s pregnant? No, and apparently you didn\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>His expression was tortured, his face haggard. \u201cGrace, I have to tell you, I\u2019m scared. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she reminded him gently, \u201cit seems to me you know what makes babies as well as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryellen seemed so sure nothing would happen....\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have any choice but to leave this in God\u2019s hands,\u201d Grace told him. It was the best reassurance she had to offer. She prayed Maryellen wouldn\u2019t lose this baby, too.</p><p>Seventeen</p><p>The word sale held a special meaning for Corrie McAfee, and that was buy. There was a very good reason the Friday after Thanksgiving was the biggest shopping day of the year. The sales were not to be missed. Corrie liked nothing better than to hit the stores early. The earlier the better, as far as she was concerned.</p><p>The alarm rang at five and she was dressed and out the door half an hour later, on her way to pick up Linnette. Linnette had been assigned duty on Thanksgiving Day, and in exchange, had today off. Corrie had waited until after her daughter\u2019s shift to serve the traditional turkey dinner, although it hadn\u2019t felt right. Putting dinner off until late had been worth it, however, since it meant Linnette could go shopping with her now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thanksgiving Day had been gloomy until their daughter arrived\u2014and not just because of the rain. Predictably, Mack had declined her invitation. He claimed he had other plans, none of which he\u2019d described. Corrie didn\u2019t argue with him. Her son\u2019s so-called plans, she supposed, were to avoid arguing with his father and therefore ruining everyone else\u2019s holiday. Corrie wished she could shake some sense into both of them. Roy had been annoyed that Mack hadn\u2019t come for dinner; he would\u2019ve been equally annoyed if his son had shown up. But at least Linnette\u2019s cheerful presence had rescued his mood...and the evening.</p><p>When she pulled into the apartment parking lot, Corrie saw that Linnette\u2019s lights were blazing. She didn\u2019t have to wait long for her daughter to walk outside and run down the stairs. Opening the passenger door, Linnette slipped into the front seat.</p><p>\u201cWhere first?\u201d she asked, her eyes bright with enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cWal-Mart\u2019s already open,\u201d Corrie said. \u201cThe entire store\u2019s probably been bought out by now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>Corrie laughed. \u201cI have much to teach you, my child.\u201d</p><p>This was the first time in years that they\u2019d been able to schedule a Friday-after-Thanksgiving shopping adventure. The last occasion had been when Linnette was still in high school.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go into Silverdale next,\u201d her daughter suggested after a quick sortie through the local Wal-Mart. \u201cThe sooner we get to the mall, the better our chances of locating a decent parking spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Corrie headed out of town. There was an unusual amount of traffic for six o\u2019clock on a holiday morning, but she knew from experience that lots of people had the same idea\u2014get to the stores early. Hoping to bring Cal into the conversation, she tried to think of a subtle way to introduce him. She wanted to encourage Linnette to confide in her\u2014yet she didn\u2019t want her daughter to feel manipulated. It was a tricky balance. In the end she decided not to mention Cal. She\u2019d see if Linnette brought up the subject herself.</p> <p>\u201cThanksgiving dinner was great, Mom,\u201d Linnette said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. Speaking of that, where was your doctor friend?\u201d</p><p>Linnette tugged at the seat belt as if it was suddenly too tight. \u201cWith his family, I guess. He didn\u2019t say anything to me.\u201d This was stated with disappointment.</p><p>Corrie suspected Chad wasn\u2019t interested in dating Linnette. The one time she\u2019d met him, at the clinic\u2019s official opening, he\u2019d seemed more interested in Gloria, her daughter\u2019s neighbor, than in Linnette.</p><p>\u201cI was worried for a while that he might have spent it with Gloria,\u201d Linnette continued.</p><p>\u201cDoes she have family in the area?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cApparently not. I invited her to come over and join us, but she couldn\u2019t. She had to work, too.\u201d Linnette paused. \u201cI like Gloria, but I have to admit the real reason I asked her was to make sure she wasn\u2019t spending the day with Chad.\u201d Linnette heaved a deep sigh. \u201cThat was insincere of me and I regret it. I wish Gloria had been able to come. Dinner with you and Dad was great, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I think she would\u2019ve enjoyed having it with us. Gloria and Dad would get along really well. They\u2019re both in police work and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s not in police work anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but it doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s such a cop.\u201d</p><p>Linnette certainly had her father pegged. \u201cIt was a cozy family dinner,\u201d Corrie murmured, paying attention to the road. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201d</p><p>She concentrated on her driving, and they didn\u2019t speak for the next few minutes.</p><p>The silence was broken by Linnette. \u201cAny further developments?\u201d</p><p>Her daughter didn\u2019t need to elaborate; Corrie understood what she meant. \u201cSome,\u201d she admitted reluctantly. Perhaps if she shared what was happening, Linnette would feel freer to talk about her own life.</p><p>Linnette waited for her to explain and then nudged her lightly when she didn\u2019t. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave it at that, Mom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Corrie disliked this subject in the extreme, but talking to Roy about it was impossible. He kept so many of his thoughts and feelings hidden inside. She knew this came from long habit, the natural caution of a cop. And it came from his deep-seated desire to protect her. Still, after all these years of married life, Corrie sometimes found her husband a stranger.</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Linnette whined. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, I was thinking.\u201d She sighed. \u201cAt work during the last few weeks I\u2019ve been getting an inordinate number of hang-ups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Linnette asked. \u201cYou pick up the phone and the person on the other end slams down the receiver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But he or she doesn\u2019t say anything and then disconnects as soon as I start to ask who\u2019s there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about caller ID?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s interesting. The calls are coming from pay phones in different parts of the county. There was even one from Seattle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPay phones,\u201d Linnette repeated slowly.</p><p>\u201cYour father isn\u2019t amused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that he is,\u201d her daughter murmured. \u201cWhoever\u2019s doing this certainly gets around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it seems. And then\u2014\u201d Corrie stopped abruptly. She hadn\u2019t meant to let this other part slip.</p><p>Linnette was too observant not to notice. \u201cThere\u2019s more, isn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>Hands clenching the steering wheel, Corrie nodded. \u201cWednesday afternoon, your father and I left the office early. Shortly after we got home, Willows, Weeds and Flowers made a delivery to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe local florist?\u201d</p><p>Corrie nodded. \u201cSomeone sent us a gorgeous floral arrangement for our Thanksgiving centerpiece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour guess is as good as mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t on the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know...Your father didn\u2019t want anything to do with it. We didn\u2019t have that arrangement one minute before he was on the phone, trying to find out who sent it. Apparently it came as an order from another florist. Your dad was out the door before I could stop him.\u201d He\u2019d left her to worry for nearly two hours while he tried to track down this lead.</p><p>\u201cDid he learn anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much. But I doubt your father will let it drop that easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he learn?\u201d</p><p>Corrie had been curious herself and it\u2019d taken a good hour to get the information out of him. In the end, he\u2019d told her. \u201cHe said whoever sent the flowers paid cash and apparently used a florist in another town. When he questioned the other shop, the person who\u2019d taken the order had already gone home. No one there remembered anyone not paying with a credit card.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably follow up tomorrow, if he can get hold of that employee.\u201d</p><p>Linnette took a moment to digest this information. \u201cWhat happened to the flowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father told me to get rid of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>Linnette smiled. \u201cSort of. I brought them down to the Cedar Cove Convalescent Center that night. They were thrilled to have them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a very considerate thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was either that or watch your father have a conniption.\u201d</p><p>As if the thought had just occurred to her, Linnette asked, \u201cWas there a card attached?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d The gift card had infuriated Roy even more than the delivery itself. The person sending the flowers was taunting them. One look and her husband had torn it in half and tossed it in the garbage. After he\u2019d left, Corrie retrieved the ripped card. \u201cIt said Guess Who?\u201d</p><p>Linnette let out a low whistle. \u201cI\u2019ll bet that infuriated Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure did,\u201d Corrie said grimly. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to expect next\u2014from our mysterious stalker or your father.\u201d</p><p>Eighteen</p><p>Cecilia had never seen Allison so nervous. She\u2019d been up and down a dozen times in the half hour since she\u2019d arrived at the office after school.</p><p>\u201cDid my dad tell you when he expected to be back?\u201d she asked Cecilia for the third time, jumping up from her chair again.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, he didn\u2019t.\u201d That, too, was unusual. If Mr. Cox was going to be away for an extended period, he always let Cecilia know. Judging by the way Allison was behaving, Cecilia figured that wherever her employer was, it concerned his teenage daughter. And that probably meant it had something to do with Anson.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it, anyway?\u201d Allison glared at her watch. \u201cHe should be back by now.\u201d She sat down again.</p><p>\u201cBack from where? Does this involve Anson?\u201d Cecilia asked quietly.</p><p>The color drained from Allison\u2019s face. \u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long have I known you, Allison? Two years? Three? You haven\u2019t been this anxious about anything in all that time. Do you want to tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d To Cecilia\u2019s shock, the girl covered her face with both hands and burst into tears.</p><p>Cecilia placed an arm around her shoulders. \u201cCome on,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLet\u2019s go into your father\u2019s office.\u201d She steered Allison inside, then shut the door.</p><p>Allison slumped into the chair in front of her dad\u2019s desk, and Cecilia dragged its twin close. Reaching into her pocket, she handed the girl a clean tissue, which Allison crumpled into a tight ball.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Allison admitted. \u201cThis does have to do with Anson. He got into\u2014he did something he shouldn\u2019t have. Afterward, he felt really bad about it and didn\u2019t know what to do, so he came to me.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia had suspected trouble the instant she\u2019d seen the boy, and the few things she\u2019d heard had only confirmed that opinion. Everything about Anson screamed attitude, from his street-length gunslinger black coat to the spiked bracelet. She hadn\u2019t liked the idea of Allison hanging around with him, but had kept her opinions to herself.</p><p>\u201cAnson came to you for help?\u201d Cecilia repeated, wanting to be sure she understood. She didn\u2019t press Allison with questions about what Anson had done, for fear she\u2019d stop confiding in her.</p><p>The girl nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat could you do?\u201d Cecilia was annoyed that the boy had expected Allison to solve his problems.</p><p>\u201cI took him to talk to my dad,\u201d Allison explained. \u201cI knew Dad would help and he has. Dad\u2019s been really wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your father do?\u201d</p><p>Allison swallowed hard. \u201cDad said Anson had to turn himself in to the police.\u201d She lifted her gaze to Cecilia\u2019s. \u201cI know you\u2019re probably wondering what Anson did, but...I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Turning himself in was a good start, in Cecilia\u2019s view. Her mother had drilled the concept of personal responsibility into her from a young age. Her father, on the other hand, tried to avoid it whenever he could. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDid Anson take your father\u2019s advice and go to the police?\u201d</p><p>Allison raised her chin slightly, as though proud of her juvenile delinquent boyfriend. \u201cIt was really hard, but he was willing to own up to what he\u2019d done. Dad called his attorney friend and then he drove Anson to the sheriff\u2019s department.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarry Creech?\u201d Cecilia asked. She knew the attorney was a client of Mr. Cox\u2019s and that seemed a logical guess.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Allison twisted the tissue in her fingers. \u201cDad said Mr. Creech specializes in juvenile offenses and he\u2019d know how to handle this.\u201d</p> <p>Cecilia had assumed Anson was already eighteen, but when she mentioned that, Allison shook her head. \u201cAnson turns eighteen next month, and we were afraid the court would want to try him as an adult because he\u2019s close to legal age.\u201d Sighing heavily, she gave Cecilia a weak smile. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like Anson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t like him...\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom doesn\u2019t, either\u2014but Cecilia, you\u2019re both wrong about him! Anson is a good person. He hasn\u2019t had an easy life, you know. His mother\u2019s awful...I don\u2019t even want to get into it about his mother. She\u2019s evil.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia didn\u2019t want to get into it, either. Abe Lincoln had a hard life, too, but he didn\u2019t go around committing crimes. \u201cDoes Anson have a police record?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Allison said irritably, which suggested this was a question she\u2019d answered more than once. \u201cHe\u2019s never done anything like this before.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, he\u2019d never gotten caught. \u201cWhat did Mr. Creech advise him to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said the same thing Dad did, that Anson should turn himself in to the authorities. He met Anson and talked to his mother, and she said he\u2019s on his own.\u201d Allison\u2019s pretty face tightened in a scowl. \u201cDad met Anson\u2019s mom, too, and after that he said he\u2019d go to court with Anson. The judge has to accept the plea agreement Mr. Creech worked out with the prosecutor. He has to.\u201d Her eyes brimmed with tears. \u201cHis own mother won\u2019t even be in court with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Cecilia said in a soothing voice, \u201cso Mr. Creech was able to get a plea agreement with the prosecutor.\u201d</p><p>Allison dabbed at her eyes with the shredded tissue. \u201cYes, and Dad says it\u2019s a good one. Mr. Creech got the prosecutor to try Anson as a juvenile. That means this won\u2019t be on his permanent record, as long as he maintains all the terms of the plea bargain.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia wasn\u2019t convinced that keeping his record clean was necessarily a good thing. She just hoped Anson appreciated everything Mr. Cox and Allison were doing for him. Somehow she doubted it.</p><p>\u201cThe prosecutor agreed to let Anson do community service hours, plus he has to pay restitution, stay in school and graduate on time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll need a job if he\u2019s going to pay restitution.\u201d She tried to figure out exactly what kind of mischief Anson had gotten into.</p><p>\u201cDad helped him there, too,\u201d Allison said with such pride her eyes shone. \u201cThe Gundersons own The Lighthouse restaurant, and Dad knows Mrs. Gunderson from when she worked at the bank. He called her, and she said they needed a dishwasher and they\u2019d be willing to hire Anson. It\u2019s only minimum wage, but Mr. Gunderson said if Anson worked hard and proved himself, he\u2019d consider training him for other positions when they become available.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnson\u2019s really excited. He doesn\u2019t have a car or anything, but he\u2019s willing to take the bus.\u201d</p><p>That sounded like a big concession on Anson\u2019s part, Cecilia thought cynically. Still this was a light sentence; having to get a job and do a few community service hours didn\u2019t seem all that harsh. \u201cDoes he have to do anything else?\u201d</p><p>Allison put the sodden tissue in her pocket. \u201cHe has to stay out of trouble for a year, comply with everything the court ordered and the fire won\u2019t appear on his record.\u201d</p><p>Fire. The word didn\u2019t escape Cecilia\u2019s notice. So Anson had started a fire. There\u2019d been a piece in The Chronicle recently about the tool shed at the community park burning down. According to the article, it had been the act of an arsonist. Cecilia wondered if that was Anson\u2019s handiwork, and guessed it was.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so worried now?\u201d Cecilia asked. As far as she could see, Mr. Cox had practically held the boy\u2019s hand through this entire process.</p> <p>\u201cThe judge has to agree to everything the prosecution suggests and...\u201d Allison looked up, and moist streaks glistened on her cheeks, again. \u201cIf the judge doesn\u2019t, then Anson will go to jail. And...and\u2014\u201d she began to sob \u201c\u2014Dad said, after today, I can\u2019t see him anymore.\u201d</p><p>That was the wisest thing Mr. Cox had done. None of this was any of Cecilia\u2019s business, but she didn\u2019t want Allison getting mixed up with a boy so obviously bent on self-destruction. She\u2019d met a dozen kids just like him while growing up and, thanks to her own instinct for self-preservation, had steered clear of them.</p><p>\u201cDad said Anson could stop by and talk to me for a few minutes after court this afternoon, and then that\u2019s it. We can\u2019t see each other again until Anson\u2019s fulfilled his obligations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he agree to that?\u201d</p><p>Allison swallowed hard. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Cecilia was outraged.</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t.\u201d How quick she was to defend him. \u201cHe can\u2019t agree to that. We go to the same school and we\u2019re in the same classes every day. It would be impossible not to see each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what your father meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but Anson\u2019s going to do everything by the book. He said not spending time with me will be the hardest thing of all. It\u2019s true, Cecilia. Anson loves me and I love him. He said he wants to prove to my parents that he\u2019s worthy of their faith in him. After the way my dad helped him, I think Anson would\u2019ve done anything he asked.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia couldn\u2019t comment. Easy enough for Anson to pay lip service now. The proof would come later, and they\u2019d see if he was capable of keeping his word. She didn\u2019t mean to sound heartless, but Cecilia doubted it.</p><p>Peering through the office window behind her, Allison sprang from her chair. \u201cThey\u2019re back!\u201d Without another word, she hurried out of her father\u2019s office.</p><p>Cecilia sat down at her own desk and waited. Mr. Cox greeted her absently as he walked past. He didn\u2019t say where he\u2019d been and when he entered his office, he closed the door.</p><p>Several minutes passed before Allison returned, her eyes swollen and red.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Cecilia asked, worried by the girl\u2019s continuing distress.</p><p>Allison sniffled and attempted a smile. \u201cThe judge went along with the plea agreement. Anson starts work this afternoon, so we didn\u2019t have any time to talk. Next spring, he has to help clean the park for his community service hours. He said he\u2019ll put almost all the money from his job toward restitution, and as soon as it\u2019s paid off we can see each other again. Oh, Cecilia, I don\u2019t know if I can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot be with Anson,\u201d she said impatiently. \u201cI love him so much. Mom and Dad keep saying I\u2019m too young to know about love, but I know what I feel. It\u2019s...it\u2019s like my heart\u2019s being ripped out.\u201d She shook her head angrily and declared, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Cecilia challenged. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s difficult for me when my husband\u2019s out at sea for six months?\u201d</p><p>Allison\u2019s gaze shot up. \u201cOh, Cecilia, I\u2019m sorry, of course it is. And you\u2019re pregnant, too. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to be insensitive.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia hugged the girl, just so Allison would realize there were no hard feelings. She remembered the intensity of her own emotions the first time she fell in love. That relationship had ended badly in her senior year of high school. She hoped Allison\u2019s experience wouldn\u2019t be nearly as traumatic as hers had been.</p><p>Nineteen</p><p>Linnette had accepted a second date with Cal Washburn, and she regretted it. In fact, she\u2019d regretted it from the moment she\u2019d said yes. He\u2019d phoned shortly after Thanksgiving and before she could think better of it, Linnette had agreed to see him again. Cal was nice enough. His only shortcoming was that he wasn\u2019t Chad Timmons. Besides, she felt guilty; she\u2019d been willing to see him a second time for just one reason\u2014to make Chad jealous. Not that she\u2019d seen any evidence her ploy had worked.</p><p>\u201cI should call and cancel this date right now,\u201d Linnette muttered to Gloria, who sat on the end of her bed. \u201cI feel awful.\u201d</p><p>Gloria was on her way home from work and had stopped by to invite Linnette out for dinner. Any other night Linnette would\u2019ve leapt at the offer. Being new in town, she was grateful to have a friend.</p><p>\u201cBet the sick feeling in the pit of your stomach has nothing to do with the flu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Linnette said. She slipped on her black boots and decided to add a black knitted vest over her red blouse. The vest, one of her favorites, was decorated with sequined Christmas trees. She\u2019d hoped to wear it when Chad asked her out, but so far that hadn\u2019t happened. If he didn\u2019t show any interest soon, the holidays would be over and it\u2019d be too late to wear the vest for another eleven months.</p><p>Linnette eyed her neighbor skeptically and wondered if Chad had called her. He\u2019d expressed an interest in Gloria, but judging by the little she\u2019d managed to pick up in conversation\u2014she didn\u2019t want to be too obvious\u2014Gloria hadn\u2019t heard from him. Well, maybe she had, but if so, she hadn\u2019t mentioned it.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going out to dinner alone? Does that happen often?\u201d she asked, hoping for more information about Gloria\u2019s social life.</p><p>Gloria shrugged. \u201cSince you\u2019re busy, I\u2019ll probably just order in. Maybe from Wok and Roll. I\u2019m in the mood for something hot and spicy.\u201d</p><p>Linnette sighed. \u201cOh,\u201d she murmured, genuinely disappointed. \u201cI love their food. I wish I could join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother time,\u201d Gloria said. Straightening, she glanced at her watch. \u201cI better get out of here before your date shows up.\u201d</p><p>Just then the doorbell chimed.</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d Linnette whispered, dreading the evening more with every minute.</p><p>\u201cJust remember what you said earlier,\u201d Gloria reminded her. \u201cYou want to let him down gently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, I do. He\u2019s a really nice person. Actually, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here so you can meet him. Then you\u2019ll understand my dilemma. He\u2019s charming and witty, but it can be hard to hold a conversation and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should answer the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d Linnette hurried into the other room and opened her door.</p><p>Cal stood there holding a small potted poinsettia. \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d he said without a hint of a stutter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou brought that for me?\u201d The answer was obvious and Linnette felt even more uncomfortable. Silently she vowed she\u2019d make sure he understood this was their last date. It was the right thing to do.</p><p>\u201cFor you.\u201d His gaze moved past her to Gloria, who stepped out of the other room.</p><p>\u201cCal, this is my friend and neighbor Gloria.\u201d As she spoke, she set the plant on her coffee table, where it provided a festive touch.</p><p>Gloria came forward with her hand extended. \u201cHello, Cal, I\u2019ve been hearing a lot about you.\u201d</p> <p>Cal\u2019s gaze shot to Linnette, and he seemed both pleased and surprised. \u201cMy p-pleas-sure,\u201d he said, shaking hands.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check in with you after the weekend,\u201d Gloria said as she moved past Cal on her way out the door. \u201cHave fun, you two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just grab my coat and gloves,\u201d Linnette said and momentarily left him. She opened the hall closet to retrieve what she needed, and for good measure, added a wool scarf. When she\u2019d agreed to go out with Cal, they hadn\u2019t decided what to do. She\u2019d suggested a movie. That sounded less demanding than attempting to carry on a conversation over dinner. Because she wasn\u2019t all that interested, she hadn\u2019t bothered to look at the movie listings.</p><p>When she returned, Cal\u2019s appreciative smile warmed her. He took her coat and as he held it, she slid her arms into the sleeves, almost wishing he didn\u2019t possess such impeccable manners. Not looking at him, she buttoned her coat, wrapped the scarf around her neck and put on her gloves. They left the apartment and she locked the door, testing the doorknob\u2014just like her father always did.</p><p>\u201cDid you decide which movie you want to see?\u201d she asked as they started down the staircase. The wind chilled her face immediately and it seemed about to snow.</p> <p>He shook his head. \u201cDid you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t really look. Should I go back to the apartment and get the paper?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head again. \u201cH-hungry?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNot very. I had a late lunch.\u201d</p><p>They continued walking, and Linnette had to admit that Cal was an attractive man. She liked the way his Stetson shaded his face, giving him a mysterious look. He wore a sheepskin coat and leather gloves, and he reminded her of a young Clint Eastwood, back in his spaghetti western days.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s...j-just walk,\u201d he suggested.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d</p><p>Cal tucked her hand in the crook of his elbow and they ambled down Harbor Street. Linnette thought the traffic\u2014both vehicle and foot traffic\u2014was particularly heavy for a Saturday night, but didn\u2019t comment. Several other observations occurred to her, but she resisted mentioning them, fearing Cal would feel obliged to respond. Conversation often seemed awkward for him. After a few minutes, she came to enjoy the companionable silence.</p><p>Then suddenly it was impossible to remain silent. \u201cIt\u2019s snowing!\u201d she cried when a fat, moist snowflake fell on her nose, surprising her. \u201cCal, look! It\u2019s actually snowing.\u201d</p><p>He laughed at her obvious delight. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never get snow....\u201d In the light of the street lamps, Linnette saw his face break into a broad smile. \u201cI mean, we get snow, but it\u2019s so rare, especially this close to the waterfront.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristmas,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cOh, I agree. It\u2019s absolutely perfect that it\u2019s December and Christmas is only about two weeks away.\u201d</p><p>They followed the sidewalk past the waterfront park and the marina and rounded the curve toward the clinic and City Hall. By that time, the snow was coming down fast and furious.</p> <p>Fascinated as she was by the snow, Linnette didn\u2019t immediately notice that all the traffic was going in the same direction they were. Everyone, it seemed, was headed toward a group of carolers who lined the steps of the City Hall building. They were dressed in Victorian costume for a Dickensian Christmas, their songbooks held open. They began with \u201cGod Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\u201d and followed that with \u201cDeck the Halls.\u201d</p><p>Caught up in the sheer wonder and joy of the season, Linnette could only listen raptly. She counted three- or possibly four-part harmony. The performance was lovely in every way. The carolers in their costumes, the large decorated tree, the snow\u2014it was about as idyllic a Christmas scene as Linnette could have imagined.</p><p>She watched the performance with Cal standing behind her, his hands resting on her shoulders, and she realized his body was blocking the wind. Once again she wished he wasn\u2019t so thoughtful.</p><p>Afterward, when the carolers had finished, and the Christmas tree was lit to an enthusiastic burst of applause, Cal suggested a cup of hot cocoa at the Potbelly Deli. Chilled to the bone, Linnette readily agreed. They were fortunate to find a table by the big potbellied stove in the middle of the restaurant. The heat radiating from it soon warmed her. She recognized several people and they exchanged smiles.</p><p>The hot chocolate was delicious and served with a candy cane, in honor of the season. She and Cal shared a plate of shortbread cookies cut in Christmas shapes\u2014trees and bells and snowmen. Then Linnette bundled herself up again and they walked toward her apartment. Once more, Cal tucked her arm in his elbow. This was the time to tell him it was over, but she couldn\u2019t make herself do it, knowing her announcement would destroy the festive mood.</p><p>\u201cThat was just wonderful,\u201d she said, her steps easily keeping pace with his.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cSo Christmassy.\u201d She hadn\u2019t felt much Christmas spirit yet. She blamed Chad for her lack of holiday cheer; she\u2019d assumed that once they were working at the same place, they\u2019d be spending a lot of time together. But that hadn\u2019t turned out to be true; they saw each other only in passing and hardly ever had a chance to talk. She wondered darkly if he\u2019d planned it that way.</p><p>As they neared her apartment complex, Linnette tried to decide whether it would be a good idea to invite Cal inside. Not to offer might be rude. On the other hand, if he accepted, he might want to kiss her and she couldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>As she knew he would, Cal walked up the stairs with her. When she removed the keys from the outside pocket of her purse, he took them from her hands and unlocked her front door\u2014another old-fashioned courtesy.</p><p>She found herself blurting out a rather awkward invitation. \u201cWould you like to come inside? Inside my apartment, I mean...for a few minutes?\u201d She knew she\u2019d suffer a sleepless night if she didn\u2019t tell him. It was completely unfair to lead him on.</p><p>Linnette stepped into the apartment and was greeted by a blast of warm air as the furnace kicked in. \u201cOh!\u201d she said, pointing toward the window that overlooked the marina. With the snow drifting down, the scene could\u2019ve been an illustration on a Christmas card. A number of the boats were gaily decorated with colorful lights strung on their masts. They bobbed almost rhythmically on the water, their lights reflected by its dark surface.</p><p>Cal stopped her when she moved to flick on a lamp. \u201cKeep them off,\u201d he said\u2014again with no sign of a stutter.</p><p>Oh, boy. Here it was. Just as she\u2019d feared, he was going to kiss her. He turned her in his embrace and slipped one arm around her waist and the other over her shoulder. As he bent forward, there was ample opportunity to stop him. But she didn\u2019t. Why, Linnette could only speculate. Curiosity, she supposed.</p><p>Without even a whimper of protest, she tilted her face toward his, closed her eyes and waited. She wasn\u2019t disappointed. His mouth was firm and moist and surprisingly smooth. That was what shook her most. Because Cal was a man\u2019s man. A horse trainer. Before she was even aware of it, he\u2019d coaxed her lips open. From that point on, the kiss quickly heated up. Everything did.</p><p>A few minutes earlier, they\u2019d been standing in the cold and snow. Now heat suffused her until it was all she could do to breathe. Gripping his coat, she welcomed the exploration of his tongue, meeting his with her own, shyly at first and them more boldly.</p><p>By the time Cal broke off the kiss, Linnette felt on the verge of collapse. They edged away from each other as though they were both in shock.</p><p>Linnette staggered into the kitchen and placed her hand on the kitchen counter in an effort to regain her balance. Long before she was ready, Cal was standing behind her, touching her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted, horrified that the word sounded more like a croak.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She turned, unsure how to handle this. Sliding her arms around his waist, she exhaled a long, drawn-out breath. Unable to resist, she kissed the underside of his jaw.</p><p>He purred as softly as a kitten. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo nice. This isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cSooner than you w-want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t it,\u201d she whispered, and because she was embarrassed and more than a little confused, she buried her face in his chest. \u201cI think very highly of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d He nuzzled her neck. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Shivers of desire shot down her spine as his lips explored the sensitive skin of her throat. She had to say something, and fast. \u201cIt would be wrong to let this go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong?\u201d He lifted his head and looked directly into her eyes. \u201cNo.\u201d As if to prove her incorrect, he slowly lowered his mouth to hers again. This kiss was as devastating as the first. More so. She felt herself weaken.</p><p>\u201cCal, please,\u201d she managed when she found her voice. \u201cThere\u2019s someone else I\u2019m interested in.\u201d</p><p>He froze and instantly released her.</p><p>Linnette lurched backward. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve known Chad Timmons for some time and well, I accepted this date to make him jealous. That was wrong. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>He stepped away from her as though in a daze. Because of his Stetson she couldn\u2019t see his eyes. She didn\u2019t need to. She felt his disappointment, his frustration\u2014his pain.</p><p>\u201cI feel dreadful.\u201d She shouldn\u2019t have told him about Chad. It was too hurtful, too cruel. \u201cWill you forgive me?\u201d</p><p>Without a word, he turned and strode out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said again. But his only response was the slamming of her door.</p><p>Cal was gone. So much for letting him down gently, for not wanting to mislead him. If Linnette had been feeling sick earlier, it was nothing compared to the knot in her stomach now.</p><p>Twenty</p><p>Charlotte wasn\u2019t sure she was doing the right thing, but she wanted Ben\u2019s children to accept her\u2014and to like her. She also wanted to reassure them that she had no intention of replacing their mother, and to convey to David and his older brother, Steven, whom she had yet to meet, how much she loved their father.</p><p>David had called her two days earlier, on Monday afternoon. That was when Ben had his monthly get-together with other Navy retirees, so he\u2019d been out of the house. It was one of the rare times they were apart. Charlotte had been baking sugar cookies for the Convalescent Center when David called. He was in Seattle on business again, and had invited her to lunch on Wednesday. But just her\u2014he\u2019d made that clear. He\u2019d asked her not to let Ben know about it. In spite of her natural honesty, she\u2019d agreed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Charlotte decided to meet David at The Lighthouse restaurant. She was so proud of Justine and Seth, and she felt that meeting them would prove to David that she had a good family, too. She hoped this would assuage any fears he might have about her.</p><p>When she\u2019d made the reservation, she\u2019d discovered that Justine was working on Tuesday afternoon and Charlotte was glad of it.</p><p>\u201cGrandma,\u201d Justine said hurrying toward her as Charlotte waited in the restaurant lobby. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see you!\u201d She smiled, apparently surprised that Charlotte was alone. \u201cWhere\u2019s Ben? Wasn\u2019t your reservation for two?\u201d</p><p>That was the uncomfortable part. Charlotte hated misleading Ben. She\u2019d said she was going Christmas shopping and it\u2019d be best if he didn\u2019t accompany her. Following lunch with David, she would indeed do some shopping. Her Christmas buying had been completed long ago, but she wouldn\u2019t outright lie to Ben. This was merely a sin of omission. Still, small as the lie might be, Charlotte felt guilty about it.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a young man meeting me here,\u201d Charlotte said, gesturing at the dining room.</p><p>\u201cAre you stepping out on Ben?\u201d Justine teased.</p><p>Charlotte giggled. \u201cOh, hardly. This is Ben\u2019s son and he asked to meet me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout Ben?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes. I have a feeling he wants to get to know me for myself, but...\u201d She hesitated, unsure how much information about this clandestine lunch she should reveal to her granddaughter. \u201cDavid must be afraid of offending his father because he didn\u2019t want Ben to know about this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you agreed?\u201d Justine\u2019s tone made Charlotte feel like a disobedient schoolgirl.</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d she said, somewhat defiantly. \u201cDavid\u2019s a fine young man, but he\u2019s had a falling out with his father.\u201d Charlotte didn\u2019t feel she was to blame for that. Their disagreement was over the money David wanted to borrow. As she spoke, she scanned the dining area. Sure enough, David sat at a table by the window overlooking the Cove. He stared into space, a drink in his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s him there.\u201d</p><p>Justine frowned, but said nothing. She escorted Charlotte to the table; David stood as she approached.</p><p>\u201cDavid, it\u2019s lovely to see you.\u201d Charlotte kissed his cheek and as she leaned close, she could smell the alcohol on his breath. Stepping back, she introduced him to her granddaughter. \u201cJustine and her husband own The Lighthouse,\u201d she boasted. \u201cThey\u2019ve made a wonderful success of it.\u201d</p><p>David exchanged an enthusiastic handshake with Justine, who then left them to their lunch. Knowing the menu as well as she did, Charlotte didn\u2019t bother to open it.</p><p>The waitress was by a few minutes later for their drink orders. David asked for another malt whiskey and Charlotte requested hot tea. It was barely noon yet, far too early to be drinking, in her opinion, but it wasn\u2019t her place to chastise him.</p> <p>After their drinks were delivered, they ordered lunch. Charlotte chose the Northwest Salad, a recent addition to the menu. This was a Caesar salad, heaped with saut\u00e9ed clams, shrimp and scallops. David decided on a rare roast beef sandwich.</p><p>The waitress left, and Charlotte poured her tea. David, she noticed, had quickly gulped down his second drink and seemed ready for a third.</p><p>\u201cI imagine you\u2019re wondering why I asked to see you,\u201d he said conversationally as he sought the waitress\u2019s eye. When he saw Justine, he raised his empty glass to indicate he\u2019d like another. \u201cMy glass seems to have developed a leak,\u201d he teased the waitress when she promptly returned.</p><p>The woman smiled, obviously charmed by his humor and good looks.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve figured out why you wanted to see me without Ben,\u201d Charlotte said, stirring her tea.</p><p>His gaze met hers.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted an opportunity to get to know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said, dazzling her with a smile. \u201cYou\u2019re the first woman to capture my father\u2019s heart since Mom died.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte blushed with pleasure. \u201cI was a widow for more than twenty-five years myself.\u201d</p><p>David nodded absently. \u201cThat just goes to show that you\u2019re never too old to fall in love.\u201d</p><p>That wasn\u2019t exactly how Charlotte would\u2019ve put it, but she did agree. \u201cI love your father,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>\u201cI know you do, and it shows. I\u2019ve never seen my father this happy.\u201d He gave her another warm smile. Oh, yes, this boy was a charmer, Charlotte thought. His eyes grew serious then, and he added, \u201cThere\u2019s also another reason I wanted to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte took a sip of tea and was about to respond when Justine brought David\u2019s drink personally.</p><p>\u201cIs everything all right here?\u201d she asked. Although the question was directed at them both, she looked at Charlotte.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes,\u201d Charlotte assured her. \u201cEverything\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>Justine eyed the whiskey glass, then reluctantly left the table. As she did, Charlotte noticed that David was frowning.</p><p>\u201cDoes she always involve herself in her diners\u2019 affairs?\u201d he asked. Charlotte could tell he wasn\u2019t taking kindly to Justine\u2019s barely disguised censure.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, Justine isn\u2019t like that,\u201d Charlotte insisted, feeling a little awkward. \u201cShe just wants to be sure the service is good. Justine and Seth pride themselves on excellent service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard what she wasn\u2019t saying,\u201d he muttered. \u201cShe\u2019s afraid her precious grandmother isn\u2019t safe with a man who enjoys a drink or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely sure you misconstrued the question.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s scowl darkened and then, as if by magic, relaxed. \u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. I was hoping for quality time to get to know you, Charlotte. Unfortunately that wasn\u2019t possible at our last meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did enjoy our dinner.\u201d It had been one of the best dining experiences she\u2019d ever had\u2014until the very end, when David left so abruptly.</p><p>\u201cI did, too,\u201d he agreed, \u201cbut I felt badly afterward.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte nodded. David\u2019s sudden departure had been unsettling to Ben, and to her, too.</p><p>\u201cI want to apologize for my behavior during our dinner. I was...distressed.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte patted his hand. \u201cI understood that.\u201d</p><p>David lowered his gaze and released a beleaguered sigh. \u201cI never did get the money I needed. I don\u2019t think my father appreciates how hard it was to turn to him for help. I have my pride, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry about your troubles, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than not being able to meet one\u2019s commitments. I was raised to be responsible, and now I\u2019ve found myself in a situation where my back is to the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is worrisome, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Charlotte had lived frugally her entire life. She\u2019d never had many luxuries but always managed to meet her needs.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d His face softened at her sympathy. \u201cWho would\u2019ve believed a measly five thousand dollars would do me in?\u201d</p><p>Five thousand wasn\u2019t all that measly to Charlotte. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find a way out of this.\u201d</p><p>David shook his head and his brow furrowed. \u201cNot this time.\u201d His voice seemed to crack with the strain.</p><p>\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>David shrugged. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this now. There\u2019s no need to concern yourself with my problems. You\u2019re a sweet, caring woman and I don\u2019t want to ruin our lunch by discussing my troubles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I think we should. Maybe I could help.\u201d She didn\u2019t know what she could possibly do, but perhaps...</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be willing to do that?\u201d David asked, relief shining from his face. \u201cHelp me, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can.\u201d An uneasy sensation settled in the pit of her stomach\u2014the same feeling she always got when she was in over her head. \u201cI could talk to your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d David insisted. \u201cHard as it was, I\u2019ve already gone to him and he refused. I don\u2019t have much left, Charlotte, except my pride. My father knows I\u2019m desperate, but that didn\u2019t make any difference to him. He\u2019s never given me much help.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said that. Forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d It wasn\u2019t true either, Charlotte knew. According to Ben, he\u2019d lent his son quite a bit of money through the years. Not once had David repaid him.</p><p>\u201cI need five thousand dollars, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>The sick sensation returned. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t disagree, even though he\u2019d considered it \u201cmeasly\u201d a few minutes earlier. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I have every intention of repaying you with interest. I explained this to my father, but he didn\u2019t want to hear it. I\u2019m due for a big Christmas bonus from my company. I know I\u2019ll be getting a check for five grand, probably more, and it\u2019ll come in two weeks. I only need the money until then. If I don\u2019t get some cash now...\u201d He sat back in his chair and sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t bear to think what will happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks is all?\u201d</p><p>David leaned forward, his eyes filled with hope. \u201cTwo weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA bank won\u2019t lend it to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve tried again and again, but with my credit rating, they refuse to even talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharlotte, if you could help me, I\u2019d be forever in your debt.\u201d He picked up his drink and drained the little that remained. \u201cIt could possibly save my life.\u201d</p><p>Their lunch arrived just then, but Charlotte\u2019s normally healthy appetite had vanished. She smiled her appreciation at their waitress and reached for her tea, needing to think carefully about this. \u201cSave your life?\u201d she asked, resuming their conversation.</p><p>David turned and looked out over the cove. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into the medical aspects,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cIt\u2019s rather complicated....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need this money so badly, I\u2019ve\u2014I\u2019ve considered\u2014\u201d he paused, dropping his head \u201c\u2014suicide.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte\u2019s hand flew to her heart and she gasped.</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t have the surgery...\u201d</p><p>Charlotte hadn\u2019t recovered from the first shock and now there was a second one. \u201cThe money is for surgery?\u201d</p><p>David nodded. \u201cFunny, isn\u2019t it? No one\u2019s ever asked me why I need the five thousand dollars. My father assumes it\u2019s to pay off gambling debts. That\u2019s just like him. Sad as it is to say, my own father chooses to think the worst of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need surgery?\u201d Her mind was reeling with this information. Surely Ben would have given him the money if he\u2019d known that.</p><p>David\u2019s eyes were weary. \u201cI won\u2019t humble myself any more than I have already. You know what hospitals are like. They want the money up front before they\u2019ll agree to do any kind of procedure.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut surely you have medical insurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut not enough. I need money to pay the balance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, David, your father would want to help you if he knew the reason you\u2019re so desperate for this loan.\u201d</p><p>He smiled as if she\u2019d made a joke. \u201cYou don\u2019t know my father as well as you think. I was never his favorite. Dad always saw the bad in me instead of the good. I suppose I gave him plenty of reason but...we\u2019ve never had much of a relationship.\u201d</p> <p>Charlotte could see that Ben\u2019s problems with his son were far more complex than she\u2019d realized. For one thing, this wasn\u2019t a recent falling-out, as she\u2019d assumed. She felt sad for them both. Considering the disappointment Will had been to her in the past few years, she understood far better than she cared to admit.</p><p>\u201cDad would be so angry if he knew you gave me the money,\u201d he said, dejection overtaking his voice once again. \u201cI can\u2019t let you do it, Charlotte.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to risk damaging your marriage to my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. Once I tell him, Ben will understand. Besides, it\u2019s my money and I can do with it as I please.\u201d</p> <p>David didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Charlotte bent down for her purse and pulled out her checkbook. She\u2019d finished writing the check and ripped it free when Justine stepped up to the table.</p><p>She glared at David. \u201cGrandma! What are you doing?\u201d</p><p>David raised his hand for the check. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this is any of your concern.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte had just given him the check when Justine jerked it out of his hand. When she saw the amount and the recipient, she scowled darkly.</p><p>David stood. \u201cGive me that,\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>Then Ben was there, storming across the dining room. What happened next was embarrassing to both Charlotte and her granddaughter. Everyone started talking at once, providing a spectacle for the entire restaurant. Before she could protest, Ben was escorting Charlotte outside, David trailing after them.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know I was here?\u201d she asked, her cheeks red with mortification. She drew her coat\u2014which Justine had sent after her, via one of the waitresses\u2014more closely around her.</p><p>\u201cJustine phoned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was worried. She said David had been drinking quite a bit. I knew immediately why he asked to see you and told her to make sure you didn\u2019t give him a check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Ben, he\u2019s ill! He needs medical treatment.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s eyes narrowed on his son. \u201cIt\u2019s a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDavid, for once in your life own up to what you\u2019ve done. Tell her the truth.\u201d</p><p>Eyes wide, Charlotte stared at Ben\u2019s son. After an awkward moment, David shrugged. \u201cYou can\u2019t blame me for trying.\u201d</p><p>Her face burned. Like they said, there was no fool like an old fool. \u201cOh, Ben,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, so very sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d he said, slowly shaking his head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t your fault. My son is a master manipulator. He fed you a lie, the same way he\u2019s been feeding me lies through the years. David is willing to say or do whatever it takes to get money. I\u2019m ashamed to call him my son and even more ashamed that he\u2019s involved you in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel so...so foolish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Ben ignored his son as David walked quickly away from them. \u201cYou\u2019re a warm, compassionate person, and he took advantage of that. Now, didn\u2019t you say something about Christmas shopping?\u201d</p><p>When Charlotte sniffled forlornly, he arranged her scarf around her neck, then took her hand in his.</p><p>Twenty-One</p><p>Justine Gunderson\u2019s composure still hadn\u2019t recovered from the unpleasant episode involving her grandmother when Warren Saget walked into the restaurant. The afternoon was going from bad to worse. The fact that she managed to greet him with a smile was a credit to her skills as hostess.</p><p>\u201cHello, Warren,\u201d she said, reaching for a menu to escort him to a table. She\u2019d dated Warren, a building contractor, for several years before marrying Seth. Warren, who was almost twenty years older than she, had pressured her to marry him. At the time, Justine was convinced she never wanted a husband or children. It had taken Seth and the love they shared to change her mind. Their three-year-old son was the joy of her life. And working with Seth to build this restaurant had been\u2014and continued to be\u2014immensely satisfying.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as beautiful as ever,\u201d Warren murmured as he slid into the chair by the window. She\u2019d given him one of the best tables in the house.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She set the menu on the table.</p><p>Warren\u2019s hand covered hers. \u201cStay a few minutes,\u201d he urged.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you can,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not busy now. It\u2019s almost two-thirty\u2014the lunch crowd is gone. We haven\u2019t talked in months.\u201d He lowered his voice. \u201cYou loved me once, Justine.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d thought she did, but Seth had shown her the real meaning of the word. What she\u2019d felt for Warren, she realized in retrospect, was a strange mixture of affection and pity. His ego required him to have a pretty woman on his arm at social functions, but it was all for show. Unable to perform sexually, he was tender and indulgent with her. She\u2019d needed his kindness and for a time, the relationship had suited her perfectly. Not only that, her willingness to keep his little secret had endeared her to him. Only when Seth came into the picture and Warren felt threatened had he wanted to marry her. For a while, when admitting the depth of her feelings for Seth had proved painful and difficult, Justine had actually considered marrying Warren.</p><p>That way Seth would leave her alone, she\u2019d believed\u2014and he had, but she wasn\u2019t free of him. Seth Gunderson was in her thoughts every minute of every day. There\u2019d been no escaping Seth or the love she felt for him. When she\u2019d finally agreed to marry him, she knew without a doubt that she\u2019d made the right decision.</p><p>\u201cPlease join me,\u201d Warren asked, his eyes pleading with her. \u201cFor just a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly Justine sat down. After the afternoon she\u2019d had, a few minutes\u2019 respite would do her good. It wasn\u2019t often that she encountered a man like David Rhodes. She felt a little guilty about calling Ben, but she couldn\u2019t tolerate the sight of David manipulating her grandmother like that. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Warren stood and pulled out the chair opposite him. His business dealings might be shady, but his manners could never be questioned.</p><p>When the waitress came for the drink order, Warren asked for two glasses of wine.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she protested, but he refused to listen.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you need to unwind.\u201d</p><p>This was something else about Warren. He seemed, at times\u2014like now\u2014to discern her feelings with astounding accuracy. Granted, at other times he could be incredibly insensitive. She decided just to enjoy the moment.</p><p>The chardonnay arrived, and despite herself, Justine relaxed and took a sip. This was one of those days when a glass of wine in the middle of the afternoon was exactly what she needed.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Warren asked, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and looked away. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you, Justine.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond. That period of her life was over.</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cVery much so.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and looked around. \u201cYou and Seth have done a wonderful job with this restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d No one really knew how much effort went into their business. Seth often worked fifteen-hour days and she served as a hostess and managed the books. The Lighthouse demanded attention to detail\u2014every kind of detail. Early that morning, Seth had been in the parking lot picking up litter and cigarette butts, and later he\u2019d had to clean out the grease trap in the kitchen. Both unpleasant tasks. People tended to see the glamour but not the work that went into running a successful business. Most nights when Justine got Leif from his daycare, she was exhausted. She worried that her son was being raised by strangers. She wanted a second child. Seth did, too, but the timing, he felt, was wrong. Justine worried that the timing might never be right. Much as she loved the restaurant, it had taken over their lives.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re frowning,\u201d Warren said, breaking into her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d She laughed, making light of it.</p><p>He leaned toward her and reached for her hand. \u201cThere\u2019s no use pretending. I want you back.\u201d</p><p>He seemed sincere and that touched her. \u201cWarren, I\u2019m married,\u201d she said gently.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s just that Seth is working so hard.\u201d She was, too, but she didn\u2019t mention that. \u201cI have a good marriage, and I love my husband and son.\u201d</p><p>Warren looked down at the open menu, but she doubted he was reading over the daily specials. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how difficult it is to live in the same town and see you practically every day. It\u2019s tearing me apart. We had something special and I haven\u2019t found it with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t kept tabs on his relationships, but it seemed to her that Warren had gone through a number of women in the last few years. The young ones didn\u2019t last long, she noticed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d he pressed. \u201cI refuse to believe that, Justine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren...\u201d</p><p>He looked up and over her shoulder. His eyes narrowed as Seth approached the table.</p><p>\u201cSeth,\u201d Justine said, flustered that he\u2019d found her with an old boyfriend. \u201cWarren invited me to sit down for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Her husband glanced at the two glasses of wine. He offered Warren a casual smile. \u201cHow are you, Warren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonely,\u201d he said, his gaze locking with Justine\u2019s. She swallowed uncomfortably.</p><p>Seth placed a possessive hand on Justine\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHas Susan taken your order yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recommend the oyster stew. It\u2019s the special of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarren doesn\u2019t like oysters,\u201d Justine said and immediately knew she should\u2019ve kept her mouth shut. Judging by Seth\u2019s expression, he didn\u2019t want to be reminded of her once-close relationship with Warren.</p><p>\u201cCan you come and see me once you\u2019re finished visiting with Warren?\u201d When she nodded, Seth went to his small office behind the hostess desk.</p><p>Justine stood. \u201cI need to get back to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth doesn\u2019t deserve you,\u201d Warren muttered. \u201cI\u2019d treat you like a queen if you came back to me.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even bother to reply. Justine was happy, if tired and overworked. Seth, too. They were both committed to this restaurant; Seth was determined to make good on their investment and pay back the money his father had lent him.</p><p>\u201cCircumstances change, Justine. I\u2019ll be waiting for you when you\u2019re ready. You won\u2019t be sorry,\u201d he promised her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Justine sincerely doubted that.</p><p>\u201cYou needed to see me?\u201d she asked when she stepped into her husband\u2019s office.</p><p>Seth sat behind his desk. \u201cWhat did Warren want?\u201d he asked her with a frown.</p><p>\u201cNot much.\u201d She gave him a quick shrug. \u201cJust to say hello.\u201d It was on the tip of her tongue to plead with him not to be angry. Having a glass of wine with an old friend meant little. Warren was nothing to her anymore and certainly no threat to Seth.</p> <p>Her husband regarded her a moment, then sighed. \u201cI guess I was rude to him\u2014and to you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t contradict him. Instead, she walked around the desk and sat on his lap. Slipping her arms around his neck, she rested her head on his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re the one I love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cI\u2019m a jealous fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both need a vacation.\u201d</p><p>Seth snorted a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen anytime soon.\u201d</p> <p>Justine knew that, but she could\u2019ve done without the reminder.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, as if he\u2019d suddenly remembered something. \u201cWhat happened earlier? I saw your grandmother and Ben leave, and then right afterward a younger man shot out of the restaurant in quite a huff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was Ben\u2019s son, and you wouldn\u2019t believe the afternoon I\u2019ve had.\u201d She described how she\u2019d snatched the check out of the other man\u2019s hand. When she\u2019d finished, Justine was surprised to find her husband smiling. \u201cYou think swindling my grandmother out of five thousand dollars is a laughing matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Seth assured her. \u201cWhat I find amusing is that David Rhodes took off out of the parking lot, tires squealing. He hadn\u2019t gone more than a block when I saw one of Cedar Cove\u2019s finest racing after him, siren blaring.\u201d</p><p>It seemed a fitting end to David\u2019s visit.</p><p>Twenty-Two</p> <p>Ever since Thanksgiving, when the floral arrangement had arrived, Corrie had been feeling uneasy. For the first time since the postcards had begun to show up, she felt she knew who was responsible. The postcards had so far been addressed to Roy. However, she suspected they should\u2019ve been addressed to her, too.</p><p>The person in question had nothing to do with Roy\u2019s police background, but everything to do with the two of them. Knowing this killed her Christmas spirit, but for Roy\u2019s sake and Linnette\u2019s, she\u2019d made the effort. The tree was up and the house decorated. She\u2019d even baked Roy\u2019s favorite cookies and given batches of fudge to Linnette and Mack.</p><p>On Saturday afternoon, Roy sat reading the paper and watching television at the same time, an ability Corrie didn\u2019t share.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to go to a movie?\u201d she asked. Today was unusual in that they didn\u2019t have weekend plans. Even more unusual, Roy wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to invite the Beldons to dinner?\u201d Corrie didn\u2019t feel like cooking, but she needed something to occupy her mind, otherwise she\u2019d sink into an abyss of memories.</p><p>Roy lowered the newspaper. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit last-minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p> <p>Her husband laid the paper on the floor. \u201cSomething\u2019s bothering you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, hesitant even now to mention her suspicions.</p><p>Roy stood, holding out his arms. Corrie didn\u2019t need a second invitation. He hugged her hard, and she sighed contentedly as they sat together on the sofa. She couldn\u2019t recall when they\u2019d last cuddled like this. Their lives were so busy and, with Linnette living in Cedar Cove, Corrie should be happy. But most of the time she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAre you thinking about those postcards again?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>\u201cA little...I\u2019ve been wondering about something. I realize we promised never to discuss it, but do you think\u2014could it possibly be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word was clipped, abrupt, shutting her out.</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like you said, Corrie, we promised never to talk about that again and we haven\u2019t. It isn\u2019t the person you think, so you can drop that idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know this for a fact?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Come on, Corrie, that was a lot of years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Like dusk, sadness settled over her and she leaned closer to her husband. Roy might not want to talk about it, but that didn\u2019t stop her from remembering. All these years she\u2019d struggled to forget and, for a while, she\u2019d succeeded. Now...now it seemed the memories wouldn\u2019t leave her alone.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go to that movie,\u201d he suggested, pulling Corrie to her feet.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She went to collect her coat and when she got back, she saw that Roy was ready, too. They drove to the sixplex cinema on the hill; because they hadn\u2019t bothered to check times, they chose the next available movie, which started in half an hour.</p><p>The theater was crammed; the foyer and concession stands had long lines. Everyone in Cedar Cove seemed to be out and about.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d she whispered as they stood in line for popcorn, \u201cGrace Sherman and Cliff Harding are here. Behind us.\u201d</p><p>Roy shrugged as if unconcerned.</p><p>\u201cThis is big news,\u201d she explained, linking her arm with his and bending toward him so as not to be overheard. \u201cThe last I heard they\u2019d split up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they married?\u201d He sounded puzzled.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said and elbowed him for being obtuse. \u201cBut close, I think. Everyone thought Cliff was going to give her an engagement ring. Then they broke up and no one knew why.\u201d</p><p>Roy seemed uninterested, but Corrie could tell he was listening. \u201cI saw them together one time since, and that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019ve had a change of heart. It happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happened with us,\u201d she told him.</p><p>From the way he looked at her, Corrie knew he didn\u2019t appreciate being reminded.</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope they\u2019re back together,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>After waiting in line, Roy and Corrie reached the concession counter and ordered drinks and popcorn. They exchanged greetings, then discovered they were attending the same movie.</p><p>\u201cOlivia and Jack were going to meet us here, but they canceled at the last minute,\u201d Grace explained. \u201cJack had to go into the office for some reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Know what you mean,\u201d Roy said as he paid for their popcorn. Corrie held the bucket and one drink. \u201cSee you two inside,\u201d he said. He returned his wallet to his back pocket and picked up the second drink.</p><p>\u201cSave us a couple of seats if you can,\u201d Cliff said, eyeing the crowd.</p><p>\u201cSure thing.\u201d</p><p>The movie had apparently received good reviews because the theater was filling up fast. Corrie and Roy found a place to sit near the back but didn\u2019t see four adjacent seats anywhere. Christmas was only a week away and amidst all the frantic preparations, people were obviously looking for a relaxed afternoon.</p><p>Grace and Cliff entered the theater, and Corrie pointed to the two seats directly ahead of them.</p><p>Cliff and Grace made their way past several other people and took the seats in front of Corrie and Roy.</p><p>\u201cThis is the best we could do,\u201d Roy said, leaning forward.</p><p>\u201cHey, I feel fortunate to get a seat at all,\u201d Cliff told him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Roy set the bucket of popcorn between him and Corrie, and they shared that while the music and advertisements played. Corrie noticed the loving way Grace rested her head on Cliff\u2019s shoulder. There was something so touching about this that Corrie couldn\u2019t help being affected. It had been the same way with her and Roy when they\u2019d first reunited.</p><p>She\u2019d been a college freshman when they met and they\u2019d quickly fallen in love. After a while, they were constantly together. Roy was a star athlete, the football team\u2019s quarterback. He was a campus hero, attractive to all the girls, admired by all the guys. There was even talk of his being drafted professionally. He had such promise, such ambitions.</p><p>They\u2019d broken up when she discovered he was seeing someone else. She\u2019d been devastated. To this day, he swore he hadn\u2019t slept with this other girl; he insisted one of their friends had lied to her. She believed him, but she also knew he\u2019d been under tremendous pressure. In the middle of the football season, when she needed to see him, he\u2019d made it clear he didn\u2019t have time for her. Apparently, Corrie just wasn\u2019t in his league anymore.</p><p>What she\u2019d wanted to tell him, what he hadn\u2019t been interested in hearing, was that she was pregnant.</p><p>Rejected and alone, Corrie didn\u2019t know what to do. She turned to her parents, who gave her unconditional support. At the end of the first term, they drove up to Washington and packed her things.</p><p>Corrie didn\u2019t contact Roy again. As far as she was concerned, he was out of her life. Without telling any of her friends why she was dropping out of college, she went home to Oregon. Her parents at her side, she\u2019d attended a series of counseling sessions. Together, as a family, they\u2019d decided she should give up her baby for adoption. That was the most difficult decision of her life.</p><p>Her mother had been in the labor room with her. At her own request, Corrie wasn\u2019t told whether she\u2019d had a boy or a girl. It was painful enough to sign the adoption papers, and she feared that if she knew the baby\u2019s sex she\u2019d envision him or her growing up. Not knowing was easier.</p><p>In September of the following year, when she\u2019d returned to college, Corrie was a different person. Her friends seemed childish and superficial. Nothing was the same. She studied hard and kept to herself. She knew that eventually she\u2019d see Roy on campus and was mentally prepared for it.</p><p>What she hadn\u2019t expected was that he\u2019d seek her out. In her junior year, Roy sat with her in the library one day and asked if they could talk. Even after all the time that had passed and everything that had happened, her feelings for him hadn\u2019t died. She still loved him. They\u2019d been foolish and immature, but they\u2019d both changed. That afternoon they\u2019d talked for hours. Roy noticed the difference in her and claimed he wasn\u2019t the same boy she knew, either.</p><p>A new star athlete had replaced him as quarterback, and overnight he\u2019d gone from being pro material to a has-been. It was hard on his ego for a few months, but he recovered. She\u2019d believed Roy was out of her life for good\u2014and then almost overnight he was back.</p><p>Not until Roy bought her an engagement ring did she tell him about the baby. At first Roy didn\u2019t believe her, then he was angry, and after that, overwhelmed by sadness. He wept with her, and held her and begged her forgiveness. He went to see her parents, and Corrie never knew what was said, but when she accepted his engagement ring, Roy was welcomed into the family. The night of their wedding, they\u2019d made a second vow to each other, and that was never to discuss their child again. Now Corrie couldn\u2019t help wondering if it was that child who\u2019d come to find them.</p><p>\u201cCorrie,\u201d Roy whispered, \u201care you asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinking,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>She might have been deep in thought but Cliff Harding was snoring up a storm. Grace woke him and he gave a start, then settled down to watch the movie. Ten minutes later, Cliff was snoring again. Two-thirds of the way through, Grace stood and led Cliff out of the theater. On her way to the aisle, she smiled apologetically at Corrie and Roy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Corrie had to admit she wasn\u2019t following the movie, either. Her thoughts weren\u2019t on the rather complicated caper plot but on the child she\u2019d never known. The child she\u2019d given up for adoption.</p><p>Twenty-Three</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ordering cheesecake,\u201d Grace said as she slid into a booth at the Pancake Palace. She and Olivia had finished their Wednesday night aerobics class and decided to talk over coffee and pie. Coconut cream, however, wasn\u2019t going to do it for Grace. She was disgruntled and unhappy, and one look told her Olivia felt the same way.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both ordering cheesecake,\u201d Olivia said as she took the seat across from Grace.</p> <p>\u201cYou first,\u201d Grace said. They\u2019d been best friends since grade school and were still as close as sisters. She kept almost nothing from Olivia and knew her friend trusted her unequivocally. Theirs was a special friendship.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Jack,\u201d Olivia said with a groan. \u201cDoes that surprise you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Goldie, their favorite waitress, came over, carrying a pot of decaf. \u201cThe usual?\u201d she asked, as she filled their mugs. Olivia and Grace were creatures of habit. Every Wednesday night, they attended their exercise class and afterward went directly to the Pancake Palace for pie and coffee.</p><p>Grace hesitated at the waitress\u2019s question and shrugged.</p> <p>Olivia did, too.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got mincemeat this week,\u201d Goldie told them in a tempting voice.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d Olivia said automatically.</p><p>Grace considered it for a second. \u201cCoconut cream,\u201d she muttered, half angry with herself for being so unwilling to venture from the tried and true. If she couldn\u2019t make such a small change, then how could she manage a truly significant one?</p><p>Goldie returned a moment later with one slice of coconut cream pie and the other of lemon meringue, plus the check.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re upset with Jack?\u201d Grace said, prompting Olivia to resume their conversation.</p> <p>\u201cDamn straight I am. Good grief, I hardly see him! I was so annoyed when he broke our movie date. I can\u2019t tell you how much I was looking forward to the four of us going out. We hardly ever do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was disappointed, too,\u201d Grace said. Who\u2019d believe that dinner and a movie would be the highlight of the Christmas season for them both?</p><p>Olivia seemed to rally. \u201cDid you and Cliff have a good time?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss that later. Finish telling me what happened between you and Jack.\u201d</p><p>To Grace\u2019s astonishment, Olivia\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cWe had an argument that night. Jack didn\u2019t get home until midnight\u2014okay, ten o\u2019clock, but it might as well have been midnight. He was at the office all day. You\u2019d think the sun rises and falls on The Chronicle. It\u2019s all he lives for, and frankly I hate it.\u201d Angrily she wiped the tears from her cheeks. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to get emotional. It\u2019s just that we seem to be at an impasse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not thinking...\u201d Grace couldn\u2019t bring herself to say the word divorce.</p><p>\u201cNo, but things have got to change. Jack works too hard, he eats mostly fast food and doesn\u2019t get any exercise. He\u2019s going to kill himself if he continues at this pace.\u201d She lowered her eyes. \u201cHe thinks this is all one big joke. He said the other day that if he keeled over, what I\u2019d miss most was regular sex.\u201d</p><p>Grace rolled her eyes. \u201cLeave it to a man to reduce everything to that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s promised his schedule will change after the first of the year, but I\u2019ve heard those promises before. I just don\u2019t want him to kill himself over a stupid newspaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves you, Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know and I love him, too. I bought him a treadmill for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Maybe Jack will take the hint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so stubborn, though.\u201d</p><p>Grace couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cWhat man isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Now Olivia smiled, too. She reached for her fork and cut into her lemon meringue. \u201cAll right, enough about me and Jack. What\u2019s going on with you and Cliff?\u201d</p><p>Grace sighed heavily. \u201cCliff fell asleep during the movie. I woke him up when he started snoring\u2014loudly.\u201d</p><p>Olivia burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cOlivia Lockhart Griffin, this is not funny.\u201d</p><p>Her friend made an effort to restrain her amusement.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes later, he was snoring again. I\u2019d had it, and we left the theater.\u201d In truth, Olivia should be grateful she\u2019d missed out on their evening. Cliff had been exhausted. He\u2019d been working with his horses all day and ended up feeling tired and cranky. Dinner after the movie had been dismal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so disappointed I could\u2019ve cried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with our men?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m sick of this,\u201d Grace said. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m married with none of the benefits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo regular sex?\u201d Olivia teased.</p><p>\u201cYou might be my best friend, but there are some things I will not divulge, even to you, and my love life is one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you don\u2019t have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed and it felt good. Christmas was four days away and she was supposed to spend Christmas Eve with her girls and then go to Cliff\u2019s late Christmas morning. But Grace found she was having second thoughts about seeing Cliff at all.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Olivia asked. \u201cJack will think it\u2019s very clever of me to buy him a treadmill, but I can\u2019t make him exercise. Nor can I keep him away from double bacon cheeseburgers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t make Cliff love me.\u201d</p><p>That comment obviously shook Olivia. \u201cCliff does love you,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>Grace used to believe that, too, but these days she wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cWe had a wonderful Thanksgiving, but now we\u2019re in a rut. Being with me seems more of a burden than a joy. Our date last Saturday was an obligation he felt he had to fulfill. I certainly didn\u2019t enjoy myself and I doubt he did, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>That was a question worth contemplating. \u201cI wish I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust promise me you won\u2019t do anything until after Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Grace made a wry face. \u201cHere\u2019s how Christmas will go. I\u2019ll arrive at Cliff\u2019s around noon, make dinner and then knit while he falls asleep in front of the television.\u201d She\u2019d wash the dinner dishes, kiss him goodbye and let herself out. She might as well stay home with her dog and cat; Buttercup and Sherlock were frequently better company. \u201cSome time the next morning,\u201d Grace concluded her scenario, \u201cCliff will phone and apologize and then we\u2019ll start all over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff needs his cage rattled,\u201d Olivia suggested, tapping her finger against her lips.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds ominous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel like you\u2019re married but don\u2019t have any of the benefits? Then tell him you want to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I should propose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cThat should wake him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to get Cliff\u2019s attention, not give him a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForce him to make a decision\u2014a commitment.\u201d</p><p>Grace could just imagine the look on his face, but maybe Olivia was right. It was time to either make that commitment or walk away. However, Grace didn\u2019t know if she had the courage to follow through on any kind of ultimatum.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Olivia pressed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to do something,\u201d Olivia said firmly, scraping up the last of her pie.</p><p>That was true enough, but suggesting marriage seemed rather drastic. \u201cI\u2019m afraid,\u201d she admitted after a thoughtful moment.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Grace set her fork aside and picked up her coffee, then put it down again. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d That wasn\u2019t the complete truth. She knew. Her biggest fear was that Cliff would tell her he had no marriage plans. Or none with her, anyway.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d Olivia stretched her arm across the table and squeezed her hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone pale.\u201d</p><p>She managed a shaky smile. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for the effects of that pie to kick in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to do it?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>Grace took a deep breath. \u201cI believe I will. It\u2019s time I learned where I stand with Cliff.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Four</p><p>Christmas morning Maryellen woke cozy and warm in bed with her husband\u2019s arms around her. She sighed happily and turned to face him.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d she whispered, and discovered that Jon had raised himself on one elbow, looking down at her. His eyes brimmed with love as he leaned over and kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d he echoed. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d She lifted her head tentatively and waited a moment. All seemed well. Her stomach hadn\u2019t immediately started to heave and that was a good sign. This pregnancy wasn\u2019t as difficult as the last, the infant son she\u2019d miscarried. This time, she\u2019d been experiencing some morning nausea but it wasn\u2019t debilitating.</p><p>Jon remained fearful that it\u2019d been a mistake to get pregnant so soon. That was irrelevant now. She hadn\u2019t tricked him; he knew she wasn\u2019t using birth control and it was bound to happen sooner or later. He\u2019d just assumed, as she did, that it would be later. When it turned out not to be, Maryellen was surprised herself\u2014and overjoyed. She wanted Katie to have a brother or sister and she didn\u2019t want to wait much longer. As it was, she was almost forty.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll notice Katie\u2019s still asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle wonder.\u201d They\u2019d gathered at Kelly and Paul\u2019s home with Maryellen\u2019s mother for Christmas Eve. Katie and Tyler had played together, racing around the Christmas tree, their laughter ringing through the house. It had been a late night, but Katie was too excited to fall asleep until almost midnight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking,\u201d Jon whispered as his warm hand closed over her breast, \u201cthat we have a good hour to ourselves.\u201d He pressed his erection against her and kissed her with an urgency that spoke of his need. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you say this is the perfect time to begin a new holiday tradition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds interesting,\u201d Maryellen murmured happily. She loved this man and knew that if she\u2019d let him walk out of her life, she would have lost herself, too\u2014lost the woman she was meant to be.</p><p>An hour later, they sat in the living room, each holding a mug of coffee, and gazed out at the view of Seattle. It was still dark, so the lights of the city shimmered in the distance. Jon settled his arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we should wake Katie?\u201d Maryellen asked.</p><p>\u201cIf we do, I have a feeling we\u2019ll live to regret it.\u201d</p><p>Jon was right. Katie tended to wake up whiny, especially after a late night. Besides, Maryellen cherished this private time with her husband and didn\u2019t want to squander it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s open our gifts,\u201d she suggested. Maryellen had spent her Christmas bonus from the Harbor Street Gallery on a high-end digital camera for Jon. He\u2019d been eyeing it for months, but couldn\u2019t justify the expense. She knew how badly he wanted it and her joy at being able to purchase it for him made her feel giddy with excitement.</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d he said. Getting up, he walked over to the tree and plucked off a small package dangling from one of the branches. Maryellen had noticed it there but hadn\u2019t touched it. Her main concern had been keeping Katie away from the gifts.</p><p>\u201cI hear good things come in small packages,\u201d she teased. They were on a limited budget, so she expected something inexpensive. A token. She tore off the wrapping and found a jeweler\u2019s embossed box. She stared at Jon, and her smile faded.</p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Her husband wasn\u2019t a man who smiled often. His delight at watching her open this gift was revealed by the way his eyes brightened and the edges of his mouth curved upward in anticipation.</p><p>Maryellen lifted the lid and gasped. It was a diamond wedding ring with a solitaire diamond that had to be a full carat in size. Tears instantly blurred her vision and speech became impossible. When they were married, all they\u2019d been able to afford was a simple gold band. Not once had Maryellen even hinted that she would\u2019ve preferred a diamond. Jon was her jewel, she\u2019d told him, and the love they shared was worth far more than any ring.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d he said urgently. \u201cDo you like it? Because if you don\u2019t, I can exchange it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it....\u201d She threw her arms around his neck and broke into sobs of joy. \u201cHow?\u201d She was sure he hadn\u2019t charged it. Jon was an excellent money manager and always paid cash. Their home didn\u2019t have a mortgage because her frugal husband had paid for each section as he built it. He hadn\u2019t finished yet, but that would happen in time.</p><p>\u201cI put aside money all year,\u201d Jon told her, using his thumbs to wipe the tears from her cheeks. \u201cI always intended for you to have a diamond, but it wasn\u2019t financially possible when we got married.\u201d</p> <p>Maryellen took the ring from its plush bed and slid it onto her finger. It was a perfect fit. She smiled up at him, then kissed him sweetly and whispered how much she loved him. Holding her hand out to admire the ring, she saw the diamond glittering in the light. \u201cI really do love it. But not as much as I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour turn,\u201d she insisted and pulled the box out from behind the tree. A large paper package tumbled out with it.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that from?\u201d Jon muttered.</p><p>He must have guessed, but still he asked. Maryellen sighed; she didn\u2019t want anything to ruin this Christmas. \u201cIt came last week from Oregon,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>The package had arrived at the gallery, addressed to the three of them, DON\u2019T OPEN UNTIL CHRISTMAS written in big block letters across the top. Without a word to Jon, Maryellen had brought it home and hidden it behind the tree.</p> <p>\u201cOpen your gift,\u201d she said, hoping to distract him.</p><p>\u201cWhen did that get here?\u201d he asked in a disgusted voice.</p><p>\u201cLast week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen sank into the chair. \u201cJon, please, don\u2019t. Katie is their only grandchild. They love her and want to be part of her life. You\u2019ve made your feelings abundantly clear, but your daughter deserves to know her grandparents.\u201d</p><p>He seemed about to argue, but after a moment his shoulders sagged and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow open your gift,\u201d she said, pushing the package toward him. It wasn\u2019t heavy, but she wanted to give him the impression that it was.</p><p>Jon eagerly ripped away the paper, and when he saw the camera box, he froze. Slowly he looked up, his eyes wide with shock. \u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d she announced gleefully.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t afford this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used my bonus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaryellen, that money is for you to buy yourself something you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. There\u2019s nothing I wanted more in this world than to give my husband the digital camera he\u2019s been salivating over for the last six months.\u201d</p><p>Jon walked to where she sat and knelt down in front of her. Taking her face between his hands, he kissed her. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen placed her arms around his neck. \u201cThis is the best Christmas of my life,\u201d she said and meant it. She had Jon and Katie, and another life was growing inside her, evidence of the love she and her husband shared.</p><p>Katie woke then, and dropping a last kiss on Maryellen\u2019s cheek, Jon ran upstairs to get his daughter. While he was busy with Katie, Maryellen poured the little girl her morning cup of orange juice.</p><p>Opening gifts with their daughter was a pleasure like no other. Katie wanted to play with each toy and examine each gift and\u2014like every young child\u2014was equally fascinated with the wrapping paper. Not surprisingly, the process took several hours. It was two in the afternoon and the turkey was in the oven before they reached the last gift\u2014the box mailed from Oregon.</p><p>Katie wasn\u2019t sure about this package without festive paper, so Maryellen helped her. Jon stood in the kitchen and watched, as if to stay as far away as possible from the gift his family had sent.</p><p>When she\u2019d carefully removed the outer packaging, Maryellen discovered three wrapped presents inside: one for Katie, another for her and the last for Jon. She sat back on her heels and glanced up at her husband.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer right away. \u201cHere, Katie,\u201d she said and handed her daughter the gift. It turned out to be a hand-crocheted white dress with a pink satin bow and it was breathtakingly beautiful. Maryellen could only imagine the time and effort that had gone into creating it.</p><p>Katie, being far more interested in her toys, quickly returned to the wooden puzzle Jon and Maryellen had purchased for her. She seemed intent on getting all the pieces back into their proper slots.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll open mine,\u201d Maryellen said. Her gift was homemade, too\u2014a knit poncho in a soft beige wool. \u201cOh, Jon, look what Ellen made for me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t comment. When Maryellen tried it on and modeled it for him, he nodded once, then moved away. Apparently something in the kitchen demanded his immediate attention.</p><p>Maryellen left his gift sitting on the coffee table. She wouldn\u2019t urge him to open it. That was his choice. The gift sat there through dinner, and it was only as she was readying for bed that she noticed Jon hadn\u2019t come upstairs yet. Katie was asleep and Maryellen had to work in the morning.</p><p>Looking down the stairway, she saw her husband sitting on the sofa, staring at the gift. After a while he seized the large package with its red-and-green wrap and tore it open. This was a step forward. So far, every gesture made by his family had been met with brutal rejection. Recognizing the significance of the moment, Maryellen covered her mouth. She didn\u2019t wait to see what Jon\u2019s parents had chosen for him. Afraid of giving herself away, she went quietly to bed and waited for him to join her.</p><p>A long time passed before he did. She\u2019d turned off the light and was lying on her side, half-asleep, when Jon climbed into the bed. He moved close to her and draped his arm over her waist, flattening his hand against her stomach.</p><p>Maryellen rested her hand on his.</p><p>\u201cYou awake?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She sighed sleepily in response. Because he was so still, she asked, \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d came his hoarse reply. \u201cMy father\u2019s a bastard. Knowing I was innocent, he sent me to rot in a jail cell. And now...now he gives me a fishing pole for Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen rolled onto her back so she could look into her husband\u2019s face and discovered Jon\u2019s eyes bright with unshed tears. Cradling his cheek with one hand, she kissed him, not sure how else to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cHe used to take me fishing when I was a kid, before my mother died. Those were the happiest memories of my childhood\u2014fishing with my dad.\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes, Maryellen wrapped both arms around him. She suspected Joseph Bowman had found the one way in which he could reach his son.</p><p>Twenty-Five</p><p>Cecilia knew Christmas Day without Ian was going to be difficult. She woke feeling melancholy, but was determined to have as merry a Christmas as possible. \u201cNext year your daddy will be with us,\u201d she assured her unborn son, rubbing her swollen belly.</p><p>As soon as she was dressed, she logged on to the computer and left her husband a long, detailed message. She sent him all her love on this most special of days and did her best to sound happy and confident. Achieving the right tone required careful thought. If she sounded too cheerful, Ian might think she didn\u2019t miss him. If she seemed depressed and miserable, he\u2019d worry. As a result, she spent almost an hour composing her message. She ended by mentioning the small get-together she was having with Cathy and Carol and added that they\u2019d invited Rachel Pendergast to join them.</p><p>A small Christmas tree sat in the window of her duplex, a smattering of gifts beneath. Ian had asked his mother to mail her a lovely gold locket; she\u2019d opened that the minute it arrived. Her in-laws had added a gift of their own\u2014a Pashmina shawl in a lovely shade of soft green. Her own mother had mailed a small box of gifts, mostly baby things, which Cecilia opened that morning. Sandra Merrick had recently married for the third time. Cecilia phoned to wish her a merry Christmas and was given the disappointing news that her mother wouldn\u2019t be able to visit her when the baby was due. She\u2019d used all her vacation time on her honeymoon. They talked for about thirty minutes and Cecilia hung up the phone with mixed feelings. Her mother was happy; Cecilia couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d felt that way after a conversation with her. She was genuinely delighted for Sandra and hoped to meet her new husband soon. Besides, she\u2019d do fine by herself when she was ready to deliver her baby; Cecilia had her friends.</p><p>At noon, she drove over to Cathy Lackey\u2019s for Christmas dinner. She saw Carol Greendale\u2019s vehicle parked outside Cathy\u2019s place\u2014Carol and her daughter, Amanda, had already arrived. Amanda had been born the same month as Allison. For a long time, Cecilia could barely look at the little girl without feeling overwhelmed by grief. But now, Cecilia felt only a twinge of pain when she saw Amanda.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d she sang out, letting herself into the apartment. She carried a special chicken pasta salad her mother made every Christmas. It had always been Cecilia\u2019s favorite. She also had a bag filled with small gifts; they\u2019d decided to exchange presents, setting a ten-dollar limit.</p><p>\u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d Cathy called from the kitchen. She wore a felt reindeer antler headpiece with bells that jingled as she walked. Cathy\u2019s son, Andy, was playing with Amanda in the living room. \u201cI\u2019ve got the bird in the oven and we should be eating in three hours\u2014if this oven holds up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblems?\u201d Carol asked. She had on a bright red sweater with three Christmas-tree bulbs in black, yellow and green decorating the front. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cProblems with the cook,\u201d Cathy answered, poking her head out of the kitchen. \u201cI should\u2019ve cleaned the oven after Thanksgiving and didn\u2019t, and then the minute I turned it on to preheat for the turkey, smoke started billowing out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom set off the smoke alarm!\u201d Andy shouted.</p><p>Carol\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could I do?\u201d Cathy joked. \u201cI shoved the bird inside and closed the door, hoping the alarm would stop\u2014which eventually it did.\u201d</p> <p>Cecilia laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I would have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cathy objected. \u201cYou would\u2019ve had a spotless oven, so this sort of disaster would never have happened. I, on the other hand, only cook when necessary and on holidays.\u201d</p><p>What Cathy had said about her was true, but Cecilia wasn\u2019t going to admit it. She did like a clean house and took pride in her homemaking skills.</p><p>\u201cRachel Pendergast is joining us for sure,\u201d Cecilia said, delighted that her new friend had agreed to come. Both Carol and Cathy had met Rachel at different times, and Cecilia had gotten to know her fairly well. Cathy and Carol were perfectly willing to invite her to their Christmas party, even if she wasn\u2019t officially a Navy wife. Nate Olsen was a friend of their husbands.</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d Cathy said, \u201cthe more the merrier.\u201d</p> <p>The doorbell chimed just as Cathy finished speaking. Carol answered, and Rachel walked in, her nose red from the cold, bearing a sweet potato casserole and a canvas bag with a few wrapped presents peaking out. \u201cMerry Christmas,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not late, am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, not at all,\u201d Cathy assured her. She took the casserole dish and set it on the kitchen counter.</p><p>\u201cWelcome,\u201d Cecilia said and they hugged. Rachel shrugged off her coat and hung it on the rack by the front door, then arranged her gifts by the tree.</p><p>\u201cI got delayed at Bruce\u2019s,\u201d she explained, glancing at her watch.</p><p>At first Cecilia assumed that Bruce was Rachel\u2019s brother or some other relation, until she remembered he was her widower friend.</p><p>\u201cJolene didn\u2019t want me to leave,\u201d Rachel was saying.</p> <p>Cathy brought out eggnog and they all sat down in the living room to open gifts. Cecilia had bought each of the other women a tube of luxurious hand cream, and puzzles for the kids; in return she received nail polish from Rachel, in a color called \u201cSanta\u2019s New Suit,\u201d a paperback from Carol, and, from Cathy, a pewter picture frame engraved with booties and other baby images. She suspected Cathy had gone over their price limit and felt tears well up as she caught her friend\u2019s eye and mouthed, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Soon after that, the two kids moved into the bedroom, where Amanda had convinced Andy to play house with her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make you dinner,\u201d the four-year-old said smartly.</p><p>Andy looked skeptical. \u201cWill the smoke alarm go off again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are Bruce and Jolene?\u201d Carol asked Rachel. \u201cI think I missed something here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Bruce is a...friend. A widower. His daughter, Jolene, is nine now. Her mother died when she was five. A while ago, she said she wants me to marry her dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did Bruce react to that?\u201d Carol asked.</p><p>\u201cForget her father, how did you handle it?\u201d Cathy wanted to know.</p> <p>Rachel grimaced slightly. \u201cIt was awkward for both of us. Bruce and I see each other on occasion. Mostly for companionship. For example, Bruce asked me to go Christmas shopping with him and I did.\u201d</p><p>Cathy exchanged a glance with Cecilia. \u201cDoes Nate know about this other guy?\u201d</p><p>Rachel nodded. \u201cBruce is just a friend. Nate knows that. Technically I\u2014I\u2019ve only gone out with Nate twice, and we\u2019ve stayed in touch.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia knew they\u2019d been in daily contact ever since she\u2019d shown Rachel how to log onto the Internet and send e-mail messages. Ian had recently mentioned how much happier Nate seemed to be now that he was able to communicate with Rachel on-line.</p><p>\u201cNate gave me a computer for Christmas,\u201d Rachel said shyly. \u201cI told him it was too much, but he wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Cathy murmured.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got the bucks,\u201d Carol said matter-of-factly. \u201cOr rather, his family does.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia, Cathy and Rachel all stared at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Cecilia asked when no one else did.</p><p>\u201cNate Olsen, right?\u201d Carol said, turning to Rachel, who nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy I thought you were talking about. His daddy\u2019s Nathaniel Olsen.\u201d</p><p>The name wasn\u2019t familiar to Cecilia, and she noticed the others looked just as blank.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Cathy asked.</p><p>\u201cNathaniel Olsen, as in Congressman Nathaniel Olsen from Pennsylvania.\u201d She glanced from one woman to the next. \u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>Rachel looked shocked, then confused. \u201cN-no, Nate never mentioned anything about his family being in politics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking money. Big money,\u201d Carol continued, clearly enjoying the role of expert. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where it all came from in the beginning\u2014probably coal\u2014but there\u2019s lots of it now and Daddy doesn\u2019t mind letting everyone know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate\u2019s an enlisted man,\u201d Cecilia said. It stood to reason that because of his father\u2019s name, he could\u2019ve gone into the Navy as an officer.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Carol agreed, sipping her eggnog. \u201cBut Nate and his father had a falling out a few years back. Then I heard that Nate dropped out of college and joined the Navy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m from Pennsylvania,\u201d she told them. \u201cIt was big news back home, and of course his daddy put a positive spin on it. He played up his family\u2019s patriotism for all it was worth at election time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet Nate hated that,\u201d Rachel said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he did, too,\u201d Carol concurred. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has much to do with his father these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Rachel had gone pale. \u201cI can just imagine what Nate\u2019s father would say if he found out his son was dating a hairdresser.\u201d</p><p>That was met with a moment\u2019s silence. \u201cIt seems to me Nate\u2019s his own person,\u201d Cecilia felt obliged to comment. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who sought you out, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I bid on him at the Dog and Bachelor Auction, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you two hit it off,\u201d Carol said.</p><p>\u201cNate doesn\u2019t have a problem with you working in a salon,\u201d Cathy added. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that, anyway? As soon as Carol and I found out you did hair, we were overjoyed. We\u2019ve been looking for a good hairdresser ever since we moved to Cedar Cove. The fact that you do nails too is a bonus.\u201d</p><p>Rachel relaxed a bit. \u201cI just wish Nate had said something\u2014about his background, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was waiting for the right time,\u201d Cecilia offered, wishing Carol hadn\u2019t said anything now. Rachel seemed so uncomfortable.</p><p>Carol must have regretted it herself, judging by her next words. \u201cCome to think of it, I\u2019m sure Nate wouldn\u2019t use family money to purchase your gift,\u201d she said. \u201cYou obviously mean a lot to him.\u201d</p><p>Rachel smiled and the color rose in her cheeks. \u201cHe means a lot to me.\u201d Her smile grew wider. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about his family, but I will tell you that Nate\u2019s one fine kisser.\u201d</p><p>Cathy shook her head. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about Nate, but I\u2019ll bet you hands down that Andrew can out-kiss him any day of the week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to get into comparisons,\u201d Cecilia began.</p><p>\u201cGirls, girls,\u201d Carol broke in, waving her arms. \u201cThis is a discussion we don\u2019t want to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Cecilia asked.</p><p>Carol looked at each one and then lowered her voice. \u201cExactly how long has it been since any of us had sex?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia and Cathy both giggled.</p><p>\u201cToo long,\u201d Cecilia said. \u201cWay too long.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Six</p><p>Corrie loved shopping at all the after-Christmas sales. Next to the Thanksgiving sales, this was her favorite shopping experience. She was delighted that Peggy Beldon had agreed to join her. They\u2019d gotten to know each other in the last year, while Roy worked on solving the murder that had taken place at Thyme and Tide, the bed-and-breakfast owned by Bob and Peggy.</p><p>\u201cI love it when I can buy Christmas wrap at seventy-five percent off,\u201d Peggy said as she loaded up her cart with half a dozen colorful rolls. \u201cOf course, Bob complains. He says I can\u2019t save money by spending money.\u201d</p><p>Corrie nodded. \u201cRoy says the same thing.\u201d This was a ritual lament\u2014the same conversation they\u2019d had on previous shopping expeditions.</p><p>\u201cMen are so unreasonable.\u201d Peggy added several strands of outdoor Christmas lights. \u201cLook at these,\u201d she said, holding up a box for Corrie to view. \u201cNext year when Bob goes to put up the outdoor display, he\u2019ll discover that a whole bunch of lights have burned out. Outdoor lights just aren\u2019t made to last more than a year. I\u2019m saving him the bother of racing down to the store for last-minute replacements. But will he thank me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d Corrie murmured. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re underappreciated.\u201d</p><p>They both laughed. Corrie was grateful she had a friend to share this kind of humor with, these small, amusing insights from daily life. She\u2019d missed that when she\u2019d first moved to Cedar Cove. She didn\u2019t make friends easily. Linnette was like that, too, and Corrie was glad her daughter had met Gloria. Linnette had made the transition from Seattle to small-town life much more smoothly, thanks to her neighbor.</p><p>When her cart was full, Corrie steered toward the checkout stands in the front of the store, with Peggy following directly behind.</p><p>After they\u2019d delivered their bounty to the car, Peggy suggested lunch. \u201cWe should spend some of the money we just saved,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d Corrie agreed happily. \u201cI haven\u2019t been to D.D.\u2019s on the Cove in months. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine with me.\u201d</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, they were sitting in a booth overlooking the marina. The Christmas decorations were still up but would be coming down after the first of January. When that happened, the town would look dull and drab, Corrie mused. Winter, the rainy season of the Pacific Northwest, was her least favorite time of year.</p><p>They both ordered hot tea and crab-melt sandwiches.</p><p>Once they were settled with their tea and waiting for their lunch, Peggy surprised her by asking, \u201cDid you get a Christmas postcard?\u201d</p><p>The Beldons had been with Roy and Corrie the night the fruit basket arrived. Peggy also knew about the mysterious postcards. So did Linnette, but only because she\u2019d accidentally found one. As far as Corrie knew, no one else in town was aware of the situation.</p><p>\u201cAn anonymous Christmas card came on the twenty-fourth,\u201d Corrie said reluctantly. This was the last thing she wanted to discuss, and yet the need to confide in someone burned in her chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAny idea who they\u2019re coming from?\u201d Peggy asked.</p><p>Corrie didn\u2019t answer right away. She swallowed the lump that formed in her throat. \u201cI do have an idea,\u201d she managed to whisper. It was all she\u2019d thought about since discussing their unknown child with Roy. He was adamant; they\u2019d vowed not to speak of it again and he was holding her to that.</p><p>Peggy, who was a sensitive woman, gave her a concerned look. \u201cIf you\u2019d rather not say anything...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...can\u2019t. I talked to Roy about it, but he won\u2019t listen. What I\u2019m thinking of happened a long time ago, and he feels it\u2019s best to leave it in the past.\u201d Corrie realized she\u2019d already said more than was advisable. \u201cHe\u2019s probably right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s drop the subject then.\u201d</p><p>Needing a diversion, Corrie reached for her tea. \u201cPerhaps that would be best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you answer one question?\u201d Peggy sounded mildly embarrassed. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t ask, but curiosity is getting the better of me. Was there a message on the Christmas card?\u201d</p><p>An involuntary smile came to Corrie. \u201cNothing cryptic, if that\u2019s what you mean. All it said was Merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of these messages have been threatening, have they?\u201d She held up her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t answer that. We\u2019re changing the subject.\u201d</p> <p>The waitress brought their lunch, a hot crab and cheese mixture spilling over both halves of the toasted English muffins. This was one of Corrie\u2019s favorite meals, a specialty at D.D.\u2019s. She wondered why she hadn\u2019t been here in so long. Mostly, she decided, because of her daughter\u2019s work schedule. They enjoyed meeting for lunch, but Linnette\u2019s shift changed every week and\u2014</p><p>Corrie\u2019s thoughts came to a grinding halt as she saw Linnette\u2019s neighbor in a booth across the restaurant. Gloria was sitting there with Chad Timmons.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d she whispered, setting her fork down.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Peggy asked, looking around for whatever had alarmed Corrie.</p><p>\u201cOver there,\u201d she whispered, bending toward her friend. \u201cSee that couple on the other side of the room?\u201d</p><p>Peggy\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIsn\u2019t that Dr. Timmons? Bob and I met him the day the clinic opened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe one and only,\u201d Corrie muttered. \u201cThe woman with him is my daughter\u2019s neighbor. Gloria something. I can\u2019t recall her last name.\u201d Corrie\u2019s heart raced with anxiety. \u201cLinnette really likes her, and I\u2019m pleased about that. A friend is exactly what she needed to feel comfortable in Cedar Cove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, Linnette has a crush on this doctor. She\u2019s turned a blind eye to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy anyone else, you mean Cal Washburn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Corrie said more loudly than she\u2019d intended. Heads turned. Unfortunately, some of the attention came from the other side of the room. Flustered, she immediately focussed on her meal, lowering her head and not looking up.</p><p>\u201cShe saw you,\u201d Peggy said.</p><p>\u201cOh, great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Corrie muttered. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like she\u2019s trying to hide the fact that she\u2019s having lunch with Dr. Timmons. Besides, Linnette has no hold on this man. In my opinion, she\u2019s being utterly foolish.\u201d What Corrie hated most was the possibility that Linnette\u2019s friendship with Gloria might be threatened by this. Corrie certainly wasn\u2019t planning to mention it to her daughter.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened with Linnette and the horse trainer?\u201d Peggy inquired.</p><p>Pinching her lips together in irritation, Corrie shook her head. \u201cShe told him she was interested in someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad.\u201d Even Peggy was disappointed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s her decision, of course. I just wish it had worked out. I like Cal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, too.\u201d</p><p>They were so involved in their conversation that Corrie didn\u2019t notice Gloria walking across the room. Not until her daughter\u2019s neighbor reached her table and spoke did Corrie glance up.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. McAfee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, uh, Gloria,\u201d she said, startled. She smiled brightly to compensate for her awkwardness. \u201cHave you met Peggy Beldon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>The three exchanged small talk for a few minutes. Corrie noticed that Dr. Timmons had already left.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to give you the wrong impression,\u201d Gloria said, after a brief silence. \u201cDr. Timmons and I aren\u2019t seeing each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would it matter?\u201d Corrie said blithely. This really wasn\u2019t any of her business.</p><p>\u201cHe had a question for me, about a police matter, and wanted to take me to lunch. I wouldn\u2019t have gone, but he insisted. I know how Linnette feels about him.\u201d</p><p>Half the town probably knew of Linnette\u2019s feelings toward the doctor, since she hadn\u2019t made the slightest effort to hide her attraction. But Corrie figured that if Chad Timmons was interested in her daughter, he would\u2019ve asked her out by now. He\u2019d obviously set his sights on Gloria, not Linnette.</p><p>\u201cLinnette is a good friend,\u201d Gloria went on to explain, \u201cand I don\u2019t want to do anything to put our friendship at risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very considerate, but I don\u2019t think you should worry about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not, but my friends are important to me, and I\u2019ve come to treasure Linnette.\u201d</p><p>Corrie just hoped her daughter appreciated what a good friend she had in her neighbor.</p><p>After a few words of farewell, Gloria departed.</p><p>\u201cShe really is very nice, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Peggy said when Gloria was gone.</p><p>\u201cShe is.\u201d Corrie nodded.</p><p>\u201cDid you see how they were looking at each other?\u201d Peggy asked. \u201cI could feel the electricity all the way over here.\u201d</p><p>Corrie frowned at her remark. This was even worse than she\u2019d thought. All she could do was hope that Linnette came to her senses and realized she was on a path that led to heartache.</p><p>Twenty-Seven</p><p>Grace Sherman had seriously considered Olivia\u2019s advice and decided to take a stand with Cliff. It was time to end this erratic relationship. She never seemed to know whether they were on or off, casual friends or practically engaged. It varied from one encounter to the next.</p><p>In her heart, she believed Cliff loved her. But he wasn\u2019t sure he could trust her, despite everything she\u2019d said and done since her Internet dalliance with Will Jefferson. Still, Grace was secure in her own feelings for Cliff. And she wanted to be with him, as his wife. She\u2019d seen the difference in Olivia since she\u2019d married Jack; she\u2019d seen the changes in Jack, too. Grace decided that if Cliff loved her, he\u2019d agree they should be married. If he didn\u2019t feel he could move forward in their relationship, then she needed to know that now. Yes, proposing might be outrageous, maybe risky, but Grace wanted to discover his feelings\u2014and his intentions\u2014once and for all.</p><p>Never having asked a man to marry her before, she wasn\u2019t sure how to go about it. Her first inclination was to invite him to a fancy restaurant, the way she\u2019d seen it done in the movies. That would create the requisite romantic setting, with champagne and classical music, but it wouldn\u2019t allow them much privacy. And if they went to The Lighthouse, elegant though it was, she\u2019d be sharing one of the most intimate moments of her life with far too many of her friends and neighbors.</p><p>So, no restaurant, which left one other option. Fortunately Grace loved to cook. She enjoyed every aspect of it\u2014choosing the recipes, the trip to the grocery store, the preparation itself. She didn\u2019t even mind washing the dishes. She felt comfortable in her kitchen. So\u2014in an effort to start the new year right\u2014she invited Cliff to dinner on Sunday.</p><p>\u201cAny particular reason?\u201d Cliff asked when she phoned him at the ranch. He seemed to guess that this wasn\u2019t an ordinary invitation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day.\u201d Grace couldn\u2019t very well admit she planned to propose to him. That would come over thick slices of homemade apple pie served with French vanilla ice cream, his favorite. Or maybe she\u2019d do it during a romantic champagne toast...</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a deal.\u201d</p><p>Grace just hoped he\u2019d be as easily persuaded when she asked that all-important question.</p><p>Not wanting to speak without forethought or reflection, she carefully wrote out what she intended to say. She wanted to review their relationship, starting with the early days when they\u2019d first begun seeing each other. They\u2019d met due to a credit card mix-up three years ago\u2014had it really been that long? After thirty-five years as Dan\u2019s wife, she\u2019d been nervous and uncertain about entering into a new relationship, and in some ways she still was.</p><p>She remembered how gentle Cliff had been with her. Following Dan\u2019s memorial service, she\u2019d collapsed from grief and fatigue, and Cliff was the one who\u2019d stayed with her, who\u2019d comforted her, who\u2019d encouraged her to grieve for her husband. She\u2019d buried Dan that day, and so much more\u2014all the memories, good and bad. Through it all, Cliff had been at her side, a constant support.</p><p>They\u2019d been separated for a while and during those long, lonely months Grace had understood how foolish she\u2019d been and how much she loved Cliff. She\u2019d made an error in judgment. She was sorry about it. Either Cliff accepted that or he didn\u2019t; it was time to find out.</p><p>For dinner Grace went all out. The most elaborate meal she could think of was individual Beef Wellingtons, along with a baked potato casserole and fresh young asparagus shoots. The salad was a special recipe from the Food Channel, with greens, blue cheese and roasted spiced pecans. She blew a good third of her monthly food budget on this meal alone, but it would be worth it.</p><p>Cliff was to arrive at six. The table was set with her mother\u2019s china, used only on the most momentous occasions. The wine\u2014a French Merlot that came highly recommended\u2014was open and breathing. She hadn\u2019t spared any expense on that, either. The candles were ready to light.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Buttercup?\u201d she asked the golden retriever, who lay on her dog bed in the kitchen. Buttercup wagged her tail enthusiastically\u2014approving, Grace was sure, of her plans. Sliding her hand inside her apron pocket, she fingered the half-dozen index cards she\u2019d placed there. These cards were her security and her talisman. On them she\u2019d written her feelings\u2014her love for Cliff, her hopes for them both.</p><p>At ten minutes after six, Grace stood in the living room looking out the window, waiting for Cliff\u2019s truck. Sherlock, her cat, lounged on the back of the couch, undisturbed by Grace\u2019s nervousness.</p><p>Every thirty seconds, she glanced at her watch, wondering what had held him up. When Cliff was twenty-five minutes late, she was convinced he\u2019d had an accident on his way into town. Black ice often covered the roads in the winter months; he could\u2019ve hit a patch and driven into a ditch.</p><p>At six-thirty, she couldn\u2019t stand it any longer and phoned the ranch. Cal picked up on the second ring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGrace?\u201d He sounded surprised.</p><p>\u201cCal, I\u2019m sorry to disturb you, but I\u2019m worried about Cliff. He isn\u2019t here yet. Can you tell me when he left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff is-s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t left yet?\u201d Her heart sank to her knees and stayed there.</p> <p>\u201cHere,\u201d Cal said, \u201ctalk-k-k to him.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she\u2019d talk to him, all right.</p><p>\u201cGrace?\u201d Cliff was on the other end of the line. \u201cDinner was tonight?\u201d</p><p>Closing her eyes she tried to quell her anger. \u201cDid you forget?\u201d she asked ever so sweetly. \u201cAgain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I did. I hope you didn\u2019t go to any trouble.\u201d</p> <p>She wouldn\u2019t lie. \u201cAs a matter of fact, I did.\u201d She restrained herself from telling him she\u2019d been cooking for two days, although she should probably let him know. \u201cWhen did you think dinner was?\u201d she asked instead.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d written it down, but apparently I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry, Grace. Is dinner ruined?\u201d</p><p>In more ways than the obvious. \u201cYes, I believe it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry?\u201d she repeated. \u201cSorry! That doesn\u2019t even begin to cover it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re angry and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m angry? What gave you that idea?\u201d The man was nothing if not perceptive.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive into town so we can talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d she said forcefully. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter...It just doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Unable to say anything more for fear she\u2019d burst into tears, she replaced the receiver.</p><p>She was too furious to sit still. Pacing helped. He\u2019d forgotten dinner on New Year\u2019s Day! That took effort on his part. Real effort. She\u2019d taken her stand and she had her answer.</p><p>Collapsing into a chair, she hid her face in her hands. Buttercup came to lie on the carpet next to her, gazing up piteously, as if she understood how Grace felt.</p><p>All at once, Grace was angry again\u2014only this time it was with Dan, the husband she\u2019d buried. She hated this, hated living alone, hated all the adjustments his death had forced her to accept. Her marriage had never been completely happy, but at least she\u2019d been contented. Over the years she\u2019d learned how to deal with Dan\u2019s mood swings because, underneath it all, she\u2019d recognized that he loved her and their daughters. In that moment she would\u2019ve given anything to have her husband back, anything for her life to return to the way it was before his year-long disappearance...before she found out he was dead.</p><p>The doorbell chimed and she glared accusingly at the front door. Cliff. He\u2019d made record time driving into town. Perhaps they should have this out now, face-to-face. It would be over then, and they could both go back to their own lives.</p><p>Grateful that she hadn\u2019t given in to the compulsion of tears, she walked to the door and opened it. As she\u2019d suspected, Cliff Harding was standing there.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk,\u201d he said. With a repentant look, he removed his Stetson, holding it in both hands.</p><p>\u201cYes, I think we should,\u201d Grace agreed, stepping aside to let him in.</p><p>Cliff surveyed the dining room table, set with china, crystal and candles, and exhaled slowly. \u201cI can see I messed up big-time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did,\u201d she said, \u201cbut the truth is, I\u2019m just as glad.\u201d She swept into the kitchen.</p><p>Cliff was right behind her. \u201cGlad?\u201d</p><p>Opening the oven door, she took out the Beef Wellingtons, warming on a cookie sheet, and unceremoniously dumped them in the garbage. Buttercup\u2019s big round eyes followed Grace\u2019s movements, silently pleading with her to consider the dog dish instead.</p><p>Cliff squatted down beside the golden retriever. \u201cI think I\u2019m in the doghouse now, girl,\u201d he whispered loudly enough for Grace to hear.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t amused.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to toss anything else? Because I was just thinking that dinner looks too good to waste.\u201d</p><p>Grace planted one hand on her hip. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be cajoled into forgetting this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Grace,\u201d he argued. \u201cIt\u2019s just a dinner. I blew it, but I\u2019m genuinely sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrong!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just a dinner. It was far more than that.\u201d Her throat was clogged with tears, and she paused in an effort to regain control. \u201cPerhaps you should sit down for a minute so I can explain.\u201d</p><p>He did as she suggested and chose the sofa. Grace sat in her favorite chair. Buttercup trailed them into the room, but seeming to sense their mood, she paused, then returned to her bed in the kitchen.</p><p>Grace knew what had to be said; inhaling, she tried to work out how to begin. Her index cards were no use now.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how sorry I am,\u201d Cliff said again.</p><p>She waved aside his apology. \u201cI know. I don\u2019t mean to be flippant but, Cliff, I\u2019m past that. This\u2014forgetting dinner with me, and not for the first time, either\u2014is very indicative of your true feelings.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI should\u2019ve written it down on my calendar. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t. I could kick myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to hear it. \u201cI had a lot of expectations for this dinner. But I guess that\u2019s my problem, not yours.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhat kind of expectations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might find this laughable.... I probably shouldn\u2019t tell you, but I planned to set the stage by serving you the dinner of your life. I was hoping to soften your heart toward me so I could\u2014propose.\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened. \u201cPropose...marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s rather comical, isn\u2019t it? Me cooking for two days, a nervous wreck, seeing to every detail, practicing how to tell the man I love that I\u2019d like to spend the rest of my life with him. I\u2019d hoped you\u2019d feel the same way, and we could set a date for the wedding.\u201d Her voice did crack then, and she struggled for composure.</p><p>\u201cGrace,\u201d Cliff whispered, his eyes warm, \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Afraid of embarrassing herself further, she swiped at the tears that were running down her cheeks. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m not going to propose.\u201d She pulled the index cards from her apron pocket. \u201cLook, I even made notes in case I got too nervous to speak. Funny, huh?\u201d She didn\u2019t give him time to respond. \u201cThere was no need for any of this. No need whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>Cliff\u2019s shoulders slumped forward. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cSomething occurred to me recently. You and Dan are actually more alike than I thought. He did this, too, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForgot dates?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She attempted a smile. \u201cHe had a way of letting me know how he felt without saying a word. A counselor once explained that it\u2019s passive-aggressive behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like that,\u201d Cliff insisted, stiffening at the implication.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten dinner dates. When we do manage to go out, you fall asleep during movies, and whenever I visit the ranch\u2014generally at your invitation\u2014you\u2019ve got more important things to do than talk to me. Okay, there was a real emergency that one night, but what about the other times? Except for Thanksgiving, you seemed completely indifferent to my being there. Well, I got your message, Cliff, loud and clear. You haven\u2019t forgiven me. And maybe you never will.\u201d She stood then, her heart heavy. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the courage to do this, so I\u2019m going to. I didn\u2019t lie when I said I love you, but for your sake as well as mine, it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>He looked stunned and remained speechless.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a ploy. It isn\u2019t a game. I\u2019m sincere when I say it would be best if we didn\u2019t see each other again.\u201d</p><p>He sat where he was for another few minutes. \u201cWill anything I say change your mind?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He reached for his hat.</p><p>\u201cI wish you nothing but good things, Cliff.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cGoodbye.\u201d She opened the door for him. He walked past, then stopped, bringing his finger to her cheek. She didn\u2019t close the door until he was off the porch and down the steps. A shudder went through her as she sagged against the wall and waited for the pain to pass.</p><p>Twenty-Eight</p><p>Roy McAfee said little to Corrie, but he knew she was right, felt it in his gut. These mysterious postcards had come from the child he\u2019d never known. It wasn\u2019t as if he\u2019d forgotten there was a baby. The fact that he had a third child was always with him, hidden in the back of his mind.</p><p>When Corrie had told him, all those years ago, that she\u2019d given birth to his baby, he\u2019d been shocked, then angry. Later, he\u2019d experienced deep sadness and a sense of bereavement. He felt that same emptiness now. He\u2019d never blamed Corrie, and he still didn\u2019t. His own insensitivity and arrogance had led to this, had forced Corrie to make the decision she had.</p><p>There was nothing she could tell him about the baby. Not even if they\u2019d had a son or a daughter.</p><p>He recalled the year after she\u2019d left him\u2014over a rumor about another girl, a rumor that was only half-true. Her loss, he\u2019d figured. And then there\u2019d been his sudden fall from favor, when the pros were no longer interested and the scouts stopped talking to him. His decline had been rapid and humbling.</p><p>Before their reconciliation, he\u2019d seen her in the library one day and remembered all the things he loved about her. Her honesty. Her warmth. Her beautiful dark-brown hair, falling thick and straight to her shoulders. The way she used to kiss him...</p><p>The next day he was back, hoping to see her again. If she happened to be there on two consecutive days, he decided, he\u2019d consider it fate.</p><p>Sure enough, at the same time as the day before, he saw her outside the library, walking with another girl. It took courage to follow her inside, to call out her name. Roy wondered if she\u2019d ever realized what it had cost him. He\u2019d put every bit of his remaining pride on the line that day. But whatever the price, it was nothing compared to the value she\u2019d given his life.</p><p>Roy recognized that he wasn\u2019t an easy man to love. He tended to be stubborn; admitting he was wrong didn\u2019t come easy. Not then and not now.</p><p>He\u2019d never forget the day Corrie told him about the baby. He\u2019d wanted to rant at her for withholding the information; he\u2019d had a right to know she was having his child. But he soon acknowledged that he hadn\u2019t given her much choice\u2014and that he wouldn\u2019t have had the maturity to deal with the situation.</p><p>Still, he hated the fact that she\u2019d been left to make these life-altering decisions on her own. When he thought about what Corrie and her family must have endured, it made him ashamed. The girl he\u2019d loved and used had given birth to his child alone because she knew, even if he didn\u2019t, that he couldn\u2019t cope with a pregnancy.</p><p>Having the baby had changed Corrie. She was as beautiful as before, perhaps more so. However, the changes had come about not in her appearance but in other subtle ways. She\u2019d matured. Already miles ahead of him in that area, she\u2019d developed a dignity and a gentle wisdom that made him yearn to be with her even more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t tell him about the baby until they were engaged. He used to wonder why she\u2019d waited. But now he understood that if she\u2019d told him before, she\u2019d never be sure whether his proposal had been offered out of love\u2014or guilt and regret. Waiting until she was utterly convinced of his love might have saved their marriage.</p><p>Roy leaned back in his chair and propped his feet on the desk. His best detective work was done in this old chair, a relic from his police days. The department had wanted to toss it, but Roy had saved it from a junkyard death, rolled it out to his car and brought it home. He\u2019d been sitting in this chair ever since. Corrie hated it, pleaded with him to get rid of it. He wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>The office door opened and then closed. \u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>Roy let his feet fall to the floor. \u201cIn here,\u201d he called out to his daughter.</p> <p>Linnette walked into his office and threw herself onto the chair opposite his desk. \u201cWhere\u2019s Mom?\u201d</p><p>Roy had exactly the same question. \u201cApparently she took an extended lunch hour. I guess that\u2019s what I get for hiring family,\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Linnette looked as if she wanted to weep.</p><p>\u201cYou need to talk to her?\u201d</p><p>His daughter nodded. \u201cDad,\u201d she said, straightening, \u201cdid you always love Mom? I mean, was there ever a time you had questions about the way you felt?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d he admitted, a little taken aback by the question, so close to his own recent thoughts. \u201cJust the other day,\u201d he teased, trying to lighten the mood. He wasn\u2019t much good at giving advice. That was Corrie\u2019s specialty.</p><p>\u201cDad, I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are,\u201d he said, somber now. \u201cRelationship problems?\u201d</p><p>Linnette shrugged. \u201cI screwed up.\u201d</p><p>Roy hated to turn his daughter away, but he wasn\u2019t comfortable with this heart-to-heart stuff. \u201cYou\u2019d better talk to your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t here. You are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn other words, it\u2019s any port in a storm?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a half smile. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He tried not to sigh. \u201cTell me what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d</p><p>Pulling off her gloves, Linnette stood up for a moment and removed her coat.</p><p>\u201cI did something I regret,\u201d she said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom bought me a date with this guy in that Dog and Bachelor Auction last summer. Cal, his name is, and he\u2019s a horse trainer. We went out, mainly because Mom pressured me into it. I didn\u2019t want to, but I finally agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it so bad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot at all. I enjoyed dinner and later, I went out with him again. I had an even better time, and then he kissed me and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on a minute.\u201d Roy raised one hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any of that. Otherwise, I might be tempted to bash his teeth in.\u201d</p><p>Linnette looked up and smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re such a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, can\u2019t help it. You\u2019re my baby girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I can say is wait until you have your own children and then decide.\u201d He gestured for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cI liked the way Cal kissed me\u2014don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to say any more about it, except that when he kissed me I got scared.\u201d</p><p>This got Roy\u2019s attention. \u201cDid he try any funny stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, nothing like that. He didn\u2019t scare me\u2014I\u2019m explaining this badly. What I mean is, I knew that if he kept on kissing me, I\u2019d want to see him again, and I couldn\u2019t because there was someone else I liked better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d That was about as profound a comment as he could make. He was finding all this a bit difficult to follow. So she liked this horse guy but she didn\u2019t? And who was the \u201csomeone else\u201d?</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be available for Chad,\u201d she elaborated, \u201cand I didn\u2019t want to get sidetracked.\u201d</p><p>Okay, now he got it. Sort of. \u201cThis is that doctor fellow?\u201d</p><p>Linnette nodded. \u201cThe problem is, it didn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean the doctor fellow isn\u2019t interested? Or you\u2019ve been thinking about Cal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth. But I was incredibly rude to Cal, and I keep wondering, you know, what would\u2019ve happened if we\u2019d continued dating. I wonder if I might\u2019ve let a wonderful man slip through my fingers\u2014and all for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening with Chad?\u201d Roy needed all the facts, logically presented.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo movement there. He\u2019s handsome and sophisticated, and at one time I would\u2019ve given my eyeteeth to go out with him, but he\u2019s never asked. I doubt he ever will, and you know what? That\u2019s fine. I\u2019m pretty much over him. It\u2019s Cal who interests me now. Except I\u2019m not sure what I should do.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Scratch the doctor. But Roy had no idea what he was supposed to say next. He was clean out of romantic advice.</p><p>\u201cI wonder if I should phone Cal and apologize or just let it go.\u201d She raised expectant eyes to him. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>That was the million-dollar question, all right. \u201cWhat do I think?\u201d he repeated slowly. \u201cYou may not know this,\u201d he began, \u201cbut your mother and I dated for a while and then split up.\u201d He paused. \u201cAfter almost two years, we met again. I\u2019ve always felt fate put her in my path that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, if it\u2019s meant to be, I\u2019ll see Cal again?\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>Linnette seemed to be mulling over his words. She stood up, her expression thoughtful, and reached for her coat. \u201cThanks, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He leaned back in his chair and placed his feet on the desk once again, crossing his ankles. \u201cAny other problems you want me to solve?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this afternoon. Tell Mom I came by, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>Linnette left and Roy was settling down to a short nap when the door opened and Corrie burst into his office. Roy took one look at his wife and dropped his feet to the carpet for the second time. \u201cCorrie? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Tears shone in her eyes as she sat in the chair just vacated by their daughter. \u201cI\u2014\u201d She swallowed hard, fidgeting with a tissue.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou refused to listen. You refused to consider what I said, so I took matters into my own hands.\u201d She was so pale, he felt suddenly terrified.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he asked, frowning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014you aren\u2019t the only one in this family capable of doing detective work. I have my own resources.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrie? What did you do?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She finally met his gaze. \u201cWe had a daughter, Roy. I gave birth to a little girl.\u201d</p><p>Roy came around from his side of the desk and placed his hand on her shoulder. Bending down, he looked into his wife\u2019s eyes, loving her so intensely he felt a physical pull toward her. \u201cI know,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found out, too.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-Nine</p><p>Rachel tried, but she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about what she\u2019d learned from Carol Greendale on Christmas Day. Nate was the son of a powerful East Coast politician. She was living in a dream world if she had any hopes for this relationship. The sooner she cut her losses, the better. And she decided to do just that, sending Nate a terse but perfectly polite e-mail. She hadn\u2019t turned on her computer since.</p><p>Friday night, Bruce phoned her at the salon and suggested they get together. Rachel\u2019s first inclination was to decline. She wasn\u2019t in the mood to be sociable, but on second thought, she didn\u2019t go out that often. Bruce was usually good company.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He didn\u2019t seem full of enthusiasm, either.</p><p>Half the time Rachel figured the only reason he called her was that he didn\u2019t know any other women. But that wasn\u2019t true; he knew plenty of women. She suspected he had an irrational fear of unmarried females trying to trap him into marriage. That wasn\u2019t an issue with her and he knew he was safe.</p><p>\u201cWant to go to a movie?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Jolene going to be?\u201d She tried to think of something that might appeal to both of them.</p><p>\u201cSlumber party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDinner?\u201d Rachel suggested.</p><p>They didn\u2019t even talk in full sentences anymore. They were like an old married couple so attuned to each other that their communication was a form of shorthand.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>That was fine with Rachel, too. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou choose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaco Shack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeet you there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Six?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>By the time she left the salon and drove out to the Taco Shack, Bruce had arrived and scouted out a table. The Taco Shack was a popular Friday-night spot. The food was good and plentiful and, best of all, cheap.</p><p>\u201cI already ordered for you,\u201d he said when she joined him.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know what I wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheese enchiladas. That\u2019s what you order every time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do?\u201d Rachel hadn\u2019t realized that. As a matter of fact, she read the entire wall-mounted menu on each visit. Apparently she was even more predictable than she\u2019d known.</p><p>She got herself a Diet Coke\u2014Bruce had a bottle of water\u2014and their dinner was delivered two minutes later. If she ordered the same thing every time, then so did Bruce. Without instructions, the server set the cheese plate in front of her and the chicken enchiladas in front of Bruce.</p><p>As though synchronized, they both reached for their forks. \u201cDo you want to watch a DVD later?\u201d Rachel asked between bites.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you got?\u201d</p><p>She named a few movies that had been going around the salon. The girls at Get Nailed had a better system than most rental places, and if a DVD didn\u2019t get returned in a timely manner, the teasing was ruthless. Rachel had borrowed several for the weekend, a couple of comedies and an emotional drama, reputedly a tearjerker.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any of those.\u201d</p><p>They decided on one of the comedies, then ate in silence for a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard from lover boy?\u201d Bruce asked, picking up his water.</p><p>\u201cIf you mean Nate, then no, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d This seemed to surprise Bruce.</p><p>\u201cI ended it.\u201d</p><p>Bruce set down his water and studied her. \u201cThis is news. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that. You didn\u2019t write this guy a Dear John letter for no reason. That\u2019s not like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI e-mailed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, a Dear John e-mail. Tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Bruce was right; she hadn\u2019t done this lightly. She\u2019d thought about the situation for almost two weeks and concluded that it couldn\u2019t work. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather not discuss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rachel\u2019s appetite was gone, and she pushed her food around while Bruce finished his. He moved his empty plate aside. \u201cThis is bothering you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Bruce was stating the obvious, a typical male trait in her experience. Because she found it impossible to conceal her emotions, she simply nodded.</p><p>They left, and he followed her back to her rental house, parking at the curb. She unlocked the front door and let him inside. The first thing she noticed in the dark foyer was the red light flashing on her answering machine. Instead of listening to her messages, she turned on the house lights and drew the living room drapes, then brought out the DVD they\u2019d selected.</p><p>While he put the disk in the slot, she poured them each a glass of wine. He liked the reds, especially merlot, and so did she. Tucking her legs under her, Rachel sat on the sofa. Bruce sat next to her.</p> <p>The previews had just started when the phone rang. Unfolding her legs and setting her wineglass on the coffee table with a sigh, she hurried into the hallway to answer it. She wasn\u2019t expecting any calls, but there was always the possibility that Jolene might be trying to get in touch with her father.</p><p>Using the remote, Bruce sped ahead to the movie portion and hit the pause button.</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d she said, slightly out of breath.</p><p>\u201cRachel, it\u2019s Nate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate?\u201d</p> <p>Bruce\u2019s eyes flew to hers and she whirled around, unable to look at him while talking to another man. She instantly felt guilty, although she told herself there wasn\u2019t a single reason she should.</p><p>\u201cThank heaven you\u2019re home. I\u2019ve been trying for the last half hour. Where were you? Damn, I wish you\u2019d turn on your cell phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you call to yell at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I just want to know what the hell is going on.\u201d His words were followed by a slight echo. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you answer my e-mails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already said everything I feel is necessary. I think we should end this right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, whatever, but the least you can do is tell me why.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel didn\u2019t want to talk about this now, especially with Bruce listening to every word.</p><p>\u201cIs there someone else? It\u2019s that Bruce guy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I do anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She twisted the cord around her elbow.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to play a guessing game with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...I found out you\u2019re Congressman Olsen\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>Her announcement was met with a brief hesitation. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes!\u201d she cried. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big problem.\u201d He needed to understand what that information had done to her. And if it wasn\u2019t a problem, why hadn\u2019t he told her himself, instead of leaving her to discover it on her own?</p><p>\u201cDoes this change who I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she acknowledged reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re a congressman\u2019s son and I work in a salon doing nails and hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t know, then I can\u2019t explain it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Nate Olsen, a Warrant Officer in the United States Navy. Why can\u2019t you accept that and that alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t tell me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you enlist?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Her question seemed to take him off guard. \u201cI had something to prove.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same with me, isn\u2019t it? You\u2019re using me in the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just one more stone to throw at your father. I can just imagine what he\u2019d think if he learned about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t give a damn what he thinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do,\u201d she said forcefully.</p><p>\u201cThen you aren\u2019t the woman I thought you were.\u201d</p><p>She braced herself against the wall. \u201cNo, I guess I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t have anything more to add, it seemed. She heard a soft goodbye, followed by a click. He\u2019d disconnected. The phone droned in her ear, and a long moment passed before she replaced the receiver.</p><p>When she turned around, Bruce was standing in the doorway. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She was going to lie, to shrug it off, but couldn\u2019t. \u201cNo, not really,\u201d she finally said.</p><p>He slipped his arms around her for a gentle hug and she rested her head against his shoulder.</p><p>Thirty</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d Olivia complained, sitting on the end of their bed. \u201cWhen are you going to start using that treadmill?\u201d She hated to nag, but he\u2019d been procrastinating ever since Christmas morning, when she\u2019d unveiled her gift. Although he\u2019d made an effort to look pleased, she\u2019d seen the disappointment in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d he said, sauntering out from the bathroom in his underwear. \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou promised to start last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know.\u201d He had the resigned look of a convicted man on his way out of the courtroom and into jail. His eyes brightened. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to wear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, you know darned well that I got you a pair of sweats. Don\u2019t tell me you forgot, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t forget,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut I don\u2019t feel right sweating in brand-new clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Griffin, that\u2019s the most ridiculous excuse I\u2019ve ever heard. Enough. Exercise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cNow!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve got to get to the office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you\u2019ve walked a mile, minimum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be too tired tonight after work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might not be,\u201d he said hopefully, looking more than a little ridiculous as he pouted while standing in their bedroom wearing only his underwear and dark socks.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re walking, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Olivia was through listening to his excuses. The week following Christmas was too soon, Jack had said, but right after New Year\u2019s, he\u2019d be on that treadmill every morning. Olivia had foolishly believed him. It was already the second week of January and he had yet to plug it in. Olivia wasn\u2019t leaving this room until he began walking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually not feeling that well.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes.</p><p>Grumbling under his breath, Jack opened his bottom drawer and pulled out the gray sweatpants and shirt. \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy,\u201d he muttered as he returned to the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel much better when you finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d she said. \u201cStart slow and increase your speed gradually. Don\u2019t overdo it,\u201d she advised. He refused to look at her, but Olivia felt only mildly guilty when she followed him into the bathroom. \u201cGrace and I complain every week about aerobics class, but we both feel good afterward. You will, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d Jack sat on the edge of the bathtub to lace up his sneakers.</p><p>\u201cTell you what,\u201d Olivia said. \u201cI\u2019ll make you breakfast while you\u2019re walking.\u201d</p><p>Jack smiled for the first time that morning. \u201cBacon, eggs, two slices of toast. Wheat,\u201d he added, knowing she disapproved of white bread.</p><p>\u201cOatmeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOatmeal,\u201d he spewed back.</p><p>\u201cWith raisins, but only if you stop your complaining.\u201d</p><p>The grumbling was back and, despite herself, Olivia laughed. He was being so childish about this.</p><p>\u201cCall the office for me, would you?\u201d he said as he walked back into the bedroom, giving her a list of instructions. One would think he was going to be away for a week instead of an hour. Standing in front of the treadmill, he stared at it, as if searching for one last chance to avoid this.</p><p>After a moment, he apparently reached a decision and plugged it in, then stepped onto the flatbed. Frowning at the display panel, he began pushing buttons.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to read the instruction book first?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>He ignored her. The machine made a loud humming noise and started moving, nearly throwing Jack off his feet. Olivia swallowed a hoot of laughter, knowing he wouldn\u2019t appreciate her reaction.</p><p>Given no option but to move with the machine, he began walking. But after a few minutes, he was huffing and puffing, reconfirming the fact that he was in terrible shape. Olivia wanted to tell him to slow down, but she could see Jack wasn\u2019t in a listening frame of mind.</p><p>Retreating to the kitchen, she heard the hum of the treadmill in the background as she put water on the stove to boil for his oatmeal. He might complain, but she noticed that he\u2019d finished the entire bowl the last time she\u2019d made it.</p><p>Next, she reached for the phone and called the newspaper office. When Steve Fullerton, the assistant editor, answered, she rattled off the instructions Jack had given her. By then, the water was bubbling and she added the oats and turned off the burner to let them cook slowly.</p><p>Wondering how Jack was doing, she went back to the bedroom. As she rounded the corner, she realized he\u2019d quit already. He\u2019d only been at it for fifteen minutes. She hoped that in time he\u2019d increase his stamina. She also hoped it wouldn\u2019t be a battle every morning the way it had been today.</p><p>When she entered the bedroom, Olivia found Jack sitting on the treadmill, dragging in deep breaths. His color was a sickly gray and he was sweating profusely.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d she whispered and hurried toward him. \u201cJack? Jack, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>He pressed his hand over his heart, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling 9-1-1.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he gasped. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right. In a minute.\u201d</p><p>Olivia wouldn\u2019t chance that. She ran into the kitchen and grabbed the phone. She punched out the three numbers.</p><p>\u201c9-1-1 Emergency,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice answered.</p><p>\u201cThis is Judge Olivia Lockhart,\u201d she said as authoritatively as she could. \u201cI need an aid car at 16 Lighthouse Road. My husband is having a heart attack.\u201d She heard the panic in her own voice but couldn\u2019t restrain it. It felt as if her own heart was in danger of failing.</p><p>\u201cJudge Lockhart, please stay on the line.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014my husband needs me. Just hurry! In the name of God, please hurry.\u201d She dropped the phone, remembering something she\u2019d read months ago\u2014that an aspirin might help a heart attack victim.</p><p>Her hands trembled as she took the aspirin bottle from the kitchen cabinet and shook it into the palm of her hand. Several tablets tumbled out and in her panic, she flung what she didn\u2019t need onto the floor.</p><p>Jack looked bad when she returned, lying prone and gasping for air. \u201cJack, oh, Jack,\u201d she sobbed. She managed to get him to swallow the aspirin. A siren wailed in the distance, and she ran to unlock the front door.</p><p>An aid car parked outside the house and two EMTs dashed toward the front steps, carrying their equipment. Olivia\u2019s relief was so great she nearly sank to her knees.</p><p>From that point on, events blurred in her mind. Both men worked on Jack for the first few minutes. He was unconscious by then and for one horrifying second she thought he\u2019d died. Terror gripped her. She couldn\u2019t breathe. Before she\u2019d even noticed what was happening, Jack had been loaded onto a gurney and transported to the aid car. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re losing him!\u201d one of the technicians shouted.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Olivia screamed as she stood in the middle of her yard. \u201cNo\u2014\u201d Unable to watch, she covered her face. The aid car sped off.</p><p>She went back into the house, found her car keys and realized how badly she was shaking. In this condition, she\u2019d be incapable of driving. It took three tries to dial Grace\u2019s home number correctly.</p><p>\u201cOlivia,\u201d her best friend said when she answered. \u201cI was almost out the door. You\u2019re lucky you caught me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJack\u2014heart attack.\u201d The three words fought their way through the tightness in her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>It was the longest five minutes of Olivia\u2019s life. All she could think about was the day her son Jordan had drowned. She remembered what a lovely August afternoon it had been when the sheriff\u2019s deputy came to the house. At first she didn\u2019t believe him\u2014didn\u2019t want to believe him. Then she\u2019d wanted her husband with her as quickly as possible.</p> <p>The officer had called Stan, but her husband worked in Seattle. It took him nearly two hours to get home. Two hellish hours as the reality of their son\u2019s death started to set in. Olivia remembered how she\u2019d gathered Justine and James around her. The three of them had sobbed and clung to one another. Grace had been the first person Olivia had phoned that day, too. She\u2019d come over and sat with her and the children until Stan arrived.</p><p>Olivia would never forget the wrenching ache in her stomach that horrible day in August and now she experienced it all over again. She didn\u2019t know if Jack was dead or alive.</p><p>Jack hadn\u2019t wanted to get on the treadmill. He\u2019d tried every excuse, but she wouldn\u2019t hear of it. Oh, no, she knew best and she wasn\u2019t going to let him off. Then she remembered that he\u2019d claimed he wasn\u2019t feeling well. She\u2019d insisted despite that. In fact, she\u2019d badgered him into it.</p><p>Grace pulled up, and the moment Olivia saw her friend, she sprinted across the lawn, weeping and nearly hysterical.</p><p>\u201cGet in,\u201d Grace said. \u201cWe can talk on the way to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t think he made it,\u201d she sobbed.</p> <p>\u201cWe won\u2019t know until we get there.\u201d</p><p>Her dearest friend was the voice of reason, but Olivia was afraid to hope, afraid to believe that Jack would be given a second chance. Losing him now, so soon after finding love again, was unthinkable. Surely God wouldn\u2019t be so cruel to her.</p><p>\u201cDid they take him to Harrison?\u201d Grace asked as she negotiated the curves on the winding road at well above the speed limit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014no, the new medical clinic, I think.\u201d All of a sudden she didn\u2019t know. The Emergency Medical Technicians must have told her, but at that point she\u2019d been beyond comprehension.</p><p>Sure enough, the aid car was parked outside the new Cedar Cove facility. Olivia hurried inside and to the front desk. \u201cMy husband is here\u2014Jack Griffin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mrs. Griffin, the doctors are working on him now. If you\u2019ll have a seat, they\u2019ll be with you as soon as they can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Olivia argued. This woman didn\u2019t seem to understand that the man behind those closed doors was her husband. Damn the rules and regulations! Jack could be dying and it was her right as his wife to be with him. In all the years she\u2019d served as a family court judge, Olivia had never used her position for personal gain. In this instance, however, she didn\u2019t care. She refused to remain silent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a judge. And I need to be with my husband.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we can\u2019t allow that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said, her voice raised and nearly hysterical. \u201cI need to be with my husband!\u201d</p><p>Grace stepped up to the counter and placed her arms around Olivia. \u201cThe doctors will be out shortly,\u201d she said.</p><p>Olivia stood her ground. \u201cI want to be with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will be,\u201d Grace promised in soothing tones.</p><p>\u201cHe needs me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now he needs those doctors more. It won\u2019t be long, Olivia.\u201d Grace led her back to the waiting area and with only a token protest, Olivia sat down.</p><p>An eternity passed. Two eternities.</p><p>Charlotte and Ben arrived.</p><p>\u201cBen has a police scanner,\u201d Charlotte explained. \u201cWhen we heard the dispatcher say 16 Lighthouse Road, we knew it must be Jack.\u201d</p><p>Charlotte sat next to her on one side, Grace on the other. Each held her hand.</p><p>When the physician finally emerged, Olivia saw that his name tag said Dr. Timmons. He walked over to her.</p><p>She stood, mentally preparing herself for the worst.</p><p>But Dr. Timmons gave her a reassuring smile. \u201cWe have him stabilized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d Her relief was so great she felt her knees buckle. Thankfully Grace was there to support her.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fortunate man. Another five or ten minutes, and there would\u2019ve been no saving him.\u201d</p><p>Olivia stared at the physician blankly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout the medical clinic here in Cedar Cove, your husband would have died on his way to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Olivia was only beginning to grasp the implications of what he was telling her.</p><p>Dr. Timmons continued. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to transport him to Harrison Hospital, where he can be examined by a heart specialist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be some paperwork for you to sign before we do that.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and remembered how embarrassed she\u2019d been when her mother and Ben and their friends from the Senior Center had been arrested for unlawful assembly after demonstrating for a medical clinic.</p><p>Little did Olivia realize that her mother\u2019s demand for a medical facility in town would one day save Jack\u2019s life.</p><p>Thirty-One</p><p>Corrie had been melancholy all day, but she didn\u2019t want to mention it to Roy. Telling him the reason for her sadness wouldn\u2019t help. On this date in 1975, she\u2019d sat in the office of her father\u2019s attorney and signed the adoption papers for her baby. In those days it wasn\u2019t necessary to get the father\u2019s permission to release the child; if it had been, Corrie would\u2019ve been forced to lie and list the child\u2019s father as unknown. That would have mortified her in front of her family and her father\u2019s friend, but she would\u2019ve done it rather than involve Roy.</p><p>Holding a just-brewed mug of coffee, Corrie watched her husband as he sorted efficiently through the mail, setting aside bills. Roy was so used to her presence at work that he usually didn\u2019t pay much attention to her when she came into his office. This time, he looked up and frowned.</p><p>\u201cYou coming down with the flu?\u201d he surprised her by asking.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Why?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged off the question. \u201cYou\u2019re pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou also seem mighty quiet all of a sudden. That\u2019s not like you,\u201d he said, trying again.</p><p>\u201cCount your blessings.\u201d</p><p>A half smile came and went in the blink of an eye. \u201cPerhaps I should, but if you\u2019re not feeling well, go home. It\u2019s a slow day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I will,\u201d she said, thinking about it as she returned to the front office. Roy had been hired to do a background check for a Seattle friend, Joe Landry. Joe had recently hired a new assistant and suspected the woman had lied about her employment history. He\u2019d asked Roy to check her out, which he\u2019d been doing for the last couple of days. These small jobs were their bread and butter.</p><p>After about half an hour, Roy came out of his office and sat on the corner of her desk. \u201cYou\u2019re still here. Corrie, if you\u2019re not feeling well, go home.\u201d When she merely shrugged, he asked, \u201cYou talk to Linnette lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d Corrie had assumed that with her daughter living in Cedar Cove, they\u2019d spend a lot of time together. That hadn\u2019t been the case. They both led busy lives and sometimes a week went by before they saw each other or even spoke.</p><p>Her answer seemed to astonish her husband. \u201cShe was by recently and had a couple of questions regarding a, uh, dating situation. That horse guy you were so keen on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave our daughter romantic advice?\u201d This was frightening.</p><p>Roy bristled. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to, but she needed help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything about this.\u201d</p><p>Roy rubbed the side of his face. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, it slipped my mind until just now. You might want to talk to her.\u201d</p><p>Corrie agreed and reached for the phone. Checking the time, she hoped she wasn\u2019t waking Linnette. Because of her changing shifts at the clinic, it was difficult to remember the hours she worked.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take her to lunch today? Do that mother-daughter thing?\u201d</p><p>Corrie removed her hand from the phone. It occurred to her that her husband seemed awfully eager to get her out of the office. First he\u2019d urged her to go home for the rest of the day. Now he was more or less telling her to take an extended lunch break. Something was going on and she wanted to know what.</p><p>Crossing her arms, she stared at him. \u201cAll right, what are you up to?\u201d</p><p>His look of bemused innocence might have fooled some, but she\u2019d been married to the man for nearly twenty-seven years.</p><p>\u201cNothing!\u201d he declared, apparently shocked that she\u2019d suggest otherwise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better tell me, Roy McAfee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m up to anything?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to talk his way out of this. \u201cBecause I know you.\u201d</p><p>He frowned and then shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re a suspicious woman.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t arguing with him. \u201cThat\u2019s what being married to you has done for me.\u201d</p><p>Roy slid off the edge of her desk and sauntered back into his office, as if he didn\u2019t have a care in the world.</p><p>Corrie followed him and sat in the chair normally reserved for clients. \u201cDo you remember what the first postcard said?\u201d</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t bother to pull it out. He\u2019d apparently read it so many times that he was able to quote it verbatim. \u201cEVERYONE HAS REGRETS. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU\u2019VE DONE YOU WISH YOU COULD DO OVER? THINK ABOUT IT.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve both been doing a lot of thinking the last few weeks,\u201d she said softly. Her heart was filled with love and, yes, regrets. She\u2019d never even held her baby but she\u2019d loved her. Signing those adoption papers, she\u2019d felt she was giving away a piece of her soul. Her parents would\u2019ve helped her, had she decided to raise the child on her own. But young though she was, Corrie had understood that it would\u2019ve been unfair to them, unfair to her and unfair to her child. A loving family had been waiting, eager for a child, and as emotionally painful as it had been, she\u2019d signed her name and released her baby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to tell you that if I\u2019d been told about the pregnancy, I would\u2019ve stepped forward and done the honorable thing. But I just don\u2019t know....\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Corrie didn\u2019t, either, which was the main reason she hadn\u2019t informed him.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time we were honest with each other,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her husband\u2019s eyes flared. \u201cI\u2019ve never been dishonest with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not openly, but it\u2019s clear you were trying to get me out of the office this afternoon and I need to know why.\u201d</p> <p>Roy sighed deeply. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said with resignation. \u201cI wanted to make a few calls and find out what I could about our...other daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout telling me?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI was going to let you know what I found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually,\u201d she said.</p><p>He hesitated, then admitted it. \u201cEventually,\u201d he echoed.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. But why? Do you think I\u2019m emotionally unstable? Did you assume I couldn\u2019t deal with whatever information you unearthed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he denied hotly. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what possible reason is there for keeping me in the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a daughter who\u2019s thirty years old,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cA daughter we know nothing about.\u201d</p><p>She stopped herself from reminding him that, until recently, they hadn\u2019t even known their first child was female.</p><p>\u201cAll these years, I worked hard at pushing every thought of her\u2014the baby\u2014from my mind. I was comfortable doing it. I didn\u2019t want to know\u2014and yet I did. We\u2019d vowed never to mention it again but now...now she\u2019s out there and she refuses to be ignored.\u201d</p> <p>That was painfully obvious to Corrie, as well. \u201cYou wanted to find her yourself. Contact her and then bring me in on what you\u2019d done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to find her,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI\u2019ve gone into the adoption registries and entered our names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy exclude me?\u201d Corrie blurted out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain that in a moment. Like I said, I went on the Internet.\u201d</p><p>Confession time for her, too. \u201cI did the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Her husband\u2019s eyes connected with hers. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t registered.\u201d</p><p>Corrie knew that. She didn\u2019t understand it. By whatever means, their daughter had been able to track them down without any of the adoption advocacy groups. And yet...</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve kept me out of it,\u201d Corrie murmured. \u201cBecause you\u2019re not sure of her motives.\u201d</p> <p>Roy nodded. \u201cIf she wanted us to find her, she would\u2019ve registered, but she didn\u2019t. That tells me all of this isn\u2019t as innocent as it might seem. She found me, but doesn\u2019t want to be found herself. She\u2019s content to mail anonymous postcards, send flowers. She\u2019s taunting me. This is all one big game to her, and for some reason she seems to have more of a problem with me than with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder why,\u201d Corrie mused aloud, \u201cbut I think you may be right.\u201d Her husband had always been cautious, and perhaps more importantly, suspicious. He considered every angle of a situation, methodically catalogued each detail. The way he worked reminded her of people who did jigsaw puzzles, carefully studying every piece.</p><p>\u201cThe adoption laws in California are different from those in Washington,\u201d Roy added. \u201cI was thinking\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalifornia?\u201d Corrie broke in.</p><p>Immediately Roy had that chagrined look\u2014he\u2019d said more than he\u2019d meant to. \u201cYes, California. That\u2019s where the final adoption took place.\u201d</p><p>Corrie hadn\u2019t noticed where the baby\u2019s home would be as she signed her name. Perhaps the attorney had told her, but if so, she had no recollection of it. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you happened to notice the date, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, why?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard and shook her head. \u201cNo reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrie?\u201d</p><p>She glanced down, forcing back emotion, unwilling to say.</p><p>\u201cI was wrong not to tell you everything I found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s more?\u201d she snapped. She felt angry that Roy had gone about this investigation and left her out. Yes, she was guilty of the same thing. But she had a good reason. Roy had claimed he didn\u2019t want to know; he\u2019d refused to discuss the subject, so she\u2019d had to learn what she could on her own.</p><p>\u201cNo. I couldn\u2019t find anything else. I\u2019ve hit a brick wall with the California records. Only Alabama, Alaska, Kansas and Oregon are \u2018open records states.\u2019 The reason I was able to find out as much as I did was through an old friend who works for the California state government.\u201d Looking at Corrie, he narrowed his eyes. \u201cHow did you discover we had a daughter?\u201d</p><p>She gazed down at her folded hands. \u201cMy mother\u2019s diaries. I have them and I looked up the year and month. She knew. She never said a word to me, but she knew we\u2019d had a daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find her, sweetheart, and when we do we\u2019ll explain everything.\u201d</p><p>Corrie just hoped it was enough for this child to know she was loved and always had been, despite the fact that she\u2019d sent her out of their lives.</p><p>Thirty-Two</p><p>Allison Cox marched into the living room and sat down across from her father, who was in his recliner reading the paper. She waited patiently for him to lower it, which he did after a few minutes.</p><p>\u201cIs there something you want to say?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She nodded, and looked down at her hands, struggling to find a way to broach the subject of Anson. He wasn\u2019t her first boyfriend, but he was special, and she needed, somehow, to convey that to her father.</p><p>\u201cDoes this have anything to do with Anson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She wondered how he\u2019d figured that out. Or maybe she was more obvious than she thought.</p><p>Her father frowned darkly. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t broken his word, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d</p><p>Her mother stepped out from the kitchen and her parents exchanged glances. They did that a lot lately. Maybe it\u2019d been going on a long time and Allison hadn\u2019t noticed. She did now, because she and Anson communicated in the same way. He hadn\u2019t talked to her since his court date, not even once, but they spoke with their eyes each and every day in French class.</p><p>His gaze told her he loved her, and Allison wanted him to know she shared his feelings. Not that she\u2019d ever let her parents find out. They\u2019d say she was too young and insist Anson wasn\u2019t right for her. They\u2019d be wrong, but it was a waste of breath to argue. She knew she loved Anson and would for the rest of her life.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me in here, too?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>Allison had never intended this to be such a big deal. \u201cAh, sure.\u201d</p><p>At least her little brother was in his bedroom. Eddie was mostly a pest, but he had his uses.</p><p>Rosie sat on the arm of the recliner and placed her hand on Zach\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou were saying?\u201d her mother gestured toward Allison.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t really started,\u201d she explained. \u201cDad asked if Anson\u2019s been talking to me.\u201d Righteously, she added, \u201cHe hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy, you know.\u201d Both her parents seemed to take it for granted that she\u2019d kept her promise. She had, but it\u2019d been the hardest thing she\u2019d ever done. The temptation was so strong because she loved Anson so much. He was the resolute one, not her, and she wanted her parents to appreciate him.</p><p>The next part was important. \u201cDad, I know you helped him get the job at The Lighthouse and I\u2019d like to thank you.\u201d</p><p>Her father shrugged, as if it was a small thing. \u201cI checked with Seth Gunderson, and Anson appears to be a good employee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Allison was sure this was true. She felt it in her heart, but having her father verify it made everything seem better.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her dad smiled slightly. \u201cAccording to Seth, Anson shows up early and works hard. He doesn\u2019t drive, so he walks to the restaurant after school and pitches in until his shift starts. The only problem Anson had was with another kid who works there named Tony.\u201d</p><p>Allison bit her lower lip. \u201cWhat kind of problem?\u201d</p><p>Her father shrugged. \u201cSeth didn\u2019t really say, but I got the impression that this Tony seems to think Anson makes the other employees look bad because he\u2019s so eager to do a good job.\u201d</p><p>Anson\u2019s attitude pleased her. \u201cIf he walks from school to work, how does he get home?\u201d</p><p>Her father shook his head. \u201cSeth didn\u2019t say, but I suspect one of the other crew drops him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Tony,\u201d she said, musing out loud.</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d her father agreed.</p><p>Allison hoped someone was giving Anson a ride. It had to be two miles between The Lighthouse restaurant and the trailer court where his mother lived. She knew for a fact that his mother wouldn\u2019t come and get him. Anson had said enough for Allison to know the woman possessed virtually no maternal instincts.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should tell her what the attorney said,\u201d Rosie advised, sharing another of those looks with Allison\u2019s father.</p><p>Zach nodded. \u201cAnson\u2019s turned every paycheck over to the city as reimbursement for the shed that was destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful.\u201d Allison clasped her hands. She was so pleased, it was difficult to hold still. \u201cAs soon as it\u2019s paid for, he can see me again, right?\u201d</p><p>Her father grinned. \u201cThat was our agreement.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang, and before anyone could move, Eddie tore out of his bedroom and raced to the front door. They could hear him talking as he stood with the door open for a minute or two. Then he closed it and came into the family room. He looked around and saw everyone watching him.</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d Rosie asked.</p><p>\u201cAllison\u2019s boyfriend. He says he wants to talk to Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnson?\u201d Allison was immediately on her feet. \u201cYou left him standing out there in the cold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that\u2019s where he wants to wait, so don\u2019t get all bent out of shape.\u201d</p><p>Zach set aside the newspaper and stood. He exchanged yet another glance with Rosie, arching his brows in obvious surprise. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a moment.\u201d He pointed his finger at Allison. \u201cAnd no, I\u2019m not letting him in the house. A deal is a deal.\u201d</p><p>Allison felt the room close in on her as her father stepped outside. \u201cMom?\u201d she cried, hardly knowing what she wanted. She found it torture to sit in the same classroom with Anson five days a week and not be allowed to speak. Now this. It killed her to know that the boy she loved was on the other side of the front door, talking to her father. She had no idea what their conversation could possibly be about, and that made it even worse.</p><p>\u201cEverything will be fine,\u201d her mother assured her as Allison sat down again.</p><p>\u201cDad\u2019s not going to do anything, is he?\u201d So far, her father had been cool. He\u2019d been the only one willing to stand up with Anson in court, and he\u2019d helped get him a job, too.</p><p>It seemed forever before her father came back in. The instant he did, Allison jumped up and hurried over to him. \u201cWhat did Anson say?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her mother joined Allison and slid an arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIt was man to man,\u201d Zach said.</p><p>\u201cDad!\u201d she cried in frustration.</p><p>He smiled then, and she knew he was teasing her.</p> <p>\u201cAnson wanted to give you a Valentine card,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Allison pressed her hand to her heart. This was so incredibly sweet and romantic she could hardly believe it.</p><p>\u201cHe felt he should talk to me first. He did promise not to have any contact with you and didn\u2019t want to go back on his word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can have it, can\u2019t I?\u201d She\u2019d die, simply die, if her father said no.</p><p>Her father hesitated. \u201cI was impressed that he\u2019d come and ask my permission.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe respects you, Dad.\u201d She knew that just from the way Anson had said her father\u2019s name after they\u2019d gone to court. \u201cYou told him I could have the card, didn\u2019t you? Oh please, it would mean so much.\u201d She hated to plead, but this was quite possibly the most important moment of her life.</p><p>Her father pulled a thick envelope from inside his jacket and held it out.</p><p>\u201cOh, Daddy, thank you! Thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said I could read it.\u201d</p><p>Allison\u2019s gaze flew to her father\u2019s. \u201cHe didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZach,\u201d her mother said. \u201cDon\u2019t tease.\u201d</p> <p>Her father grinned and handed Allison the envelope. She needed every ounce of restraint not to rip it open right then and there. Instead, she took it to her room. She sat on the end of her bed and very carefully opened the envelope. The card was expensive and romantic, and the second she caught the word love, she thought she might cry.</p><p>Inside the card was a letter, consisting of four sheets of paper, folded into fourths. Before she read it, she studied the inside verse and blinked back tears at the sentiment.</p><p>\u201cSoon,\u201d Anson had written at the bottom of the card, \u201cwe\u2019ll be together again.\u201d Then he\u2019d signed his name.</p><p>Allison devoured the letter, reading it as fast as she could. When she\u2019d finished she went back and read it all the way through a second time.</p><p>Anson told her about his job and how hard he was working to make a good impression. Being a dishwasher wasn\u2019t as easy as it sounded, and he struggled to keep up with the demand. He liked his boss. Seth Gunderson was a big Swedish guy who didn\u2019t put up with any nonsense. Anson claimed he didn\u2019t mind that, because he knew where he stood.</p><p>He also told her that if he continued to work extra hours, he could have the reimbursement monies paid by the middle of the summer. As soon as that happened, they could see each other again. She noticed he didn\u2019t refer to any of his troubles with this other guy, Tony.</p><p>Six months, Allison reflected. It would be six very long months, but she could wait.</p><p>The last part of the letter was the best. Anson wrote how difficult it was to see her every day and not be able to talk to her. In French class, he said, he found it almost impossible to keep his promise to her father. But he\u2019d do it because of everything her father had done for him. He told her that some nights he dreamed about her and always woke with a happy feeling inside.</p> <p>She dreamed of Anson, too. She hated knowing it would be another six months before they could see each other. Anson was of legal age now and she would be soon. All of this seemed so junior high and yet, at the same time, it was the only way they could be together and not alienate her parents.</p><p>She sighed heavily as she folded the letter and slipped it back inside the card. She ran her finger over the embossed image\u2014an old-fashioned picture of cupids and flowers. It was an expensive card bought at a specialty store.</p><p>Even when he was putting aside almost every penny he earned in order to pay restitution to the town, he\u2019d bought her a lovely Valentine card. There\u2019d been no need to purchase the best one available, but that was what he\u2019d done.</p><p>Her heart was so full of love for him that she wanted to weep. Then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw a sudden movement, a flash of darkness. She rose from her bed and hurried to the window.</p><p>Anson.</p><p>He wore his long black coat and a black knit hat that covered his ears.</p><p>Anson walked across the yard and stood on the other side of the window.</p><p>She smiled and he smiled back, her eyes looking into his.</p><p>He pressed his bare hand to the cold glass. She pressed her hand to his. Through the glass they mouthed \u201cI love you\u201d to each other. Seeing him, reading his card and letter\u2014it was the best Valentine\u2019s gift she\u2019d ever received.</p><p>Thirty-Three</p><p>Maryellen Bowman sang a soft lullaby as she finished bathing Katie and dressed her daughter for bed. Katie stuck her feet in her footed pajamas, chattering happily, the volume of her comments rising when Jon walked into her room. He wrapped his arms around Maryellen\u2019s waist, resting his palm against her still-flat stomach. It was a sweet gesture acknowledging the baby nestled in her womb.</p><p>\u201cLet me read to Katie tonight,\u201d he offered.</p><p>Maryellen agreed. She\u2019d had a busy day at the gallery and was exhausted. She\u2019d experienced this same fatigue when she was pregnant with Katie\u2014and the baby she\u2019d miscarried, too. She felt as though all her energy was used up by eight o\u2019clock. Jon never complained, but she worried that she wasn\u2019t giving her husband enough attention.</p><p>\u201cCome to bed early tonight,\u201d she suggested, caressing the side of his face. \u201cI miss spending time with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be if you wake me up.\u201d</p><p>Jon slowly grinned. He knew exactly what she meant and what she wanted. They hadn\u2019t made love since Christmas morning, and Maryellen craved the intimacy. She was well aware of the reason Jon so often delayed coming to bed. He was afraid their lovemaking might distress the pregnancy, but there was no indication of any problem. She felt fine, and other than the fatigue, she was perfectly healthy.</p><p>\u201cIs it...safe? I mean, are you farther along now than you were with the other baby?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she nodded. She\u2019d miscarried at nine weeks and was currently entering her fourth month. Jon took over with Katie, letting their daughter choose her favorite book\u2014Goodnight, Moon at the moment\u2014and then settling in the rocking chair with her on his lap. In the meantime, Maryellen prepared for bed. She fell asleep almost immediately and woke some hours later, when her husband joined her. She\u2019d chosen a low-cut, silk gown that he\u2019d given her a year ago on Valentine\u2019s Day.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d she asked, rolling onto her back.</p><p>\u201cEleven,\u201d he whispered, moving closer to her.</p><p>She yawned sleepily. Slipping her arms around his neck, she brought his mouth down to hers. His kisses were deep and probing, and his lips devoured hers with urgency.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she sighed softly. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d she whispered, excited by the way her nipples hardened at his touch.</p><p>Their lovemaking was exquisite, painstakingly slow and filled with passion and tenderness. Afterward, Jon held her and kissed the tears from her face. Her emotions seemed so close to the surface; that was another effect pregnancy had on her. She felt everything more intensely. In the aftermath of their lovemaking, she was so moved by Jon\u2019s devotion to her and their family that she began to cry.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d he asked between kisses. He followed one stray tear to the edge of her mouth and kissed her again.</p><p>She was breathless when he finished. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too...and Katie. And this baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d she whispered, but that didn\u2019t stop the flow of tears. Jon held her in his embrace and with her arm draped over him, she returned to sleep.</p><p>At some point during the night, she felt Jon get out of bed. He often stole away for an hour or two and then came back. Most of the time she was only vaguely aware that he\u2019d left. One night, his leaving had stirred her awake and she\u2019d climbed out of bed and gone to see if he was ill. Maryellen had found him sitting in the living room, reading the Christmas card that had accompanied the gift from his father. He\u2019d turned on only one small lamp. Deep in thought, he hadn\u2019t noticed she was there, and rather than disturb him, she\u2019d returned to bed alone. A small crack had developed in the wall Jon had built blocking out his parents. One tiny fissure. She prayed that eventually the relationship would be restored.</p><p>The next morning, Jon was whistling and in a cheerful mood. Come to think of it, Maryellen was in a good mood, too. A very good mood. Jon had a cup of herbal spice tea waiting for her when she came downstairs, dressed for work. Katie sat in her high chair banging her cup and looking pleased with herself.</p><p>\u201cWhat time will you be home tonight?\u201d Jon asked as he walked them to the car.</p><p>He asked this same question every morning; it was part of their ritual and the answer never changed. \u201cSame as usual,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Jon placed Katie in her carrier and buckled her in, kissing the top of her head before climbing out of the rear seat. \u201cHave a good day,\u201d he said and she saw the reluctance in his step as he rounded the car to kiss her, too. \u201cI wish you didn\u2019t have to go into town.\u201d This was a familiar complaint.</p><p>\u201cI wish I didn\u2019t, either.\u201d</p><p>Jon kissed her, but rather than giving her a token peck on the cheek, he kissed her passionately.</p><p>\u201cWow, what was that for?\u201d she asked, fluttering her eyes, hardly able to catch her breath.</p><p>Jon chuckled. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d he responded. \u201cI guess it\u2019s because I\u2019m a satisfied husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan on keeping you that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d She got inside the car and watched as Jon walked back to the house, his steps lighter now.</p><p>By one o\u2019clock Maryellen hadn\u2019t had a chance to eat her lunch. The gallery was doing a robust business, much to her delight. Fortunately, Lois showed up to relieve her, and she went into the back room to warm the soup delivered by the Potbelly Deli nearly an hour earlier. While the soup du jour, beef barley, heated in the microwave, she took a washroom break. That was when her happy world went into a downward spiral. She was spotting.</p><p>For a minute or more she sat there, her head spinning. This couldn\u2019t be happening. Not again. Perhaps it was the lovemaking, but the doctor had reassured her on that score. Terror clawed at her as tears sprang to her eyes.</p><p>Not wanting to alarm Jon prematurely, she called her mother at the library. \u201cMom,\u201d she said fervently, \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>Her mother seemed to know instantly what was wrong. \u201cIs it the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I don\u2019t think I can drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to take you to the medical center?\u201d</p><p>The tears came in earnest now. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>At that point, Grace took over the decision-making and decided Maryellen should see her regular physician. Dr. DeGroot\u2019s office was nearby and the receptionist promised to get them in as soon as Maryellen arrived.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve called Jon,\u201d Grace told her when she picked up Maryellen at the gallery.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried. She didn\u2019t want him to worry unnecessarily. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSweetheart, this is his baby, too. He\u2019s on his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he upset?\u201d Maryellen knew he\u2019d blame himself for this, although she felt certain their lovemaking had nothing to do with it.</p><p>\u201cJon\u2019s only concern was for you and the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told him I was fine, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course I did.\u201d</p><p>Her mother walked her into the physician\u2019s office and Maryellen was quickly ushered into a cubicle. Grace stayed with her until Jon got there and then announced that she\u2019d be out in the waiting room.</p><p>Before her mother left, Maryellen hugged her. \u201cI love you, Mom.\u201d She feared she didn\u2019t say it often enough. She\u2019d been blessed with a wonderful mother, and she knew this was a difficult time for Grace because of the breakup with Cliff.</p><p>Grace returned her hug. \u201cLove you, too, sweetie.\u201d</p><p>Once her mother had left, Jon sat next to Maryellen and held her hand.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said, trying not to break into sobs.</p><p>Her husband drew her close. She knew he was struggling with emotion, too. If she lost the pregnancy, Maryellen was afraid there wouldn\u2019t be another. Jon would refuse to risk it. She wasn\u2019t sure she could go through this again, either.</p><p>Reading her chart, Dr. DeGroot stepped into the cubicle, and smiled at the two of them, holding hands, clinging to each other physically and emotionally.</p><p>With his nurse at his side, he examined her carefully.</p><p>\u201cAm I losing the baby?\u201d Maryellen cried, unable to keep silent.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIf you mean are you miscarrying, the answer is no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs the baby safe?\u201d Jon asked.</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen didn\u2019t like the sound of this. Involuntarily she stiffened and tightened her hold on Jon\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYour cervix is weak and there\u2019s a danger you\u2019ll lose the child unless you have complete bed rest for the next five months.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen gasped. \u201cBut how can I?\u201d Katie demanded constant care and like a typical two-year-old was into everything. In addition, Maryellen had a job and with her employment came an insurance package that covered medical care. Jon was self-employed and had no benefits.</p><p>\u201cIf you want your baby to live, you\u2019ll find a way,\u201d Dr. DeGroot insisted. \u201cI can stitch up the cervix and that\u2019ll offer some protection, but you\u2019ll need to stay in bed and off your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my fault,\u201d Jon said. \u201cI...we made love last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know for sure, but frankly I doubt that\u2019s the cause,\u201d Dr. DeGroot told him. \u201cHowever, you\u2019ll need to abstain from lovemaking until after we deliver your baby.\u201d</p> <p>Maryellen nodded and so did Jon. He raised her hand to his lips and kissed the back of it.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he assured both the physician and Maryellen.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how that could be true.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure Lois is ready to take over the gallery,\u201d she lamented after Dr. DeGroot had left.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Jon said, unwilling to yield.</p><p>Maryellen knew he was right, but she couldn\u2019t help worrying. How was Jon going to be able to work, take care of her and look after Katie, too?</p><p>Jon kissed her forehead. \u201cAll you need to think about,\u201d he whispered, \u201cis taking care of yourself and our baby.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen attempted a smile. He was trying to set her mind at ease, and she was grateful for that, but even his loving words weren\u2019t proof against her doubts and fears.</p><p>Thirty-Four</p><p>Linnette could hardly imagine Cedar Cove without a medical clinic. She hadn\u2019t worked a shift yet during which she wasn\u2019t on her feet for the full eight hours. She loved her job and was responsible for a variety of cases.</p><p>She\u2019d adjusted to life in Cedar Cove surprisingly well. Naturally, it helped that she was familiar with the town, since her parents had lived there for six years. And making friends with Gloria Ashton had boosted her sense of welcome.</p><p>Thursday afternoon, Dr. Timmons walked into a cubicle, passing within inches of her. He nodded politely and she smiled back. They worked side by side nearly every day and he\u2019d been guarded but friendly. He always treated her with respect. But not once\u2014not even one time\u2014in all the weeks they\u2019d worked together had he given any indication that he\u2019d be interested in seeing her outside the clinic. Linnette had finally accepted the truth, finally stopped deluding herself. It was all too apparent that Chad had no romantic interest in her.</p><p>Linnette wanted to kick herself for being so coldhearted and callous toward Cal Washburn. Despite the fact that her mother had arranged their initial meeting, she liked him. His stuttering didn\u2019t bother her. What did bother her was how much she enjoyed his company\u2014and his kisses. She was still thinking about it. In the weeks since their last date, she hadn\u2019t stopped thinking about Cal and where their relationship might have headed if she hadn\u2019t been so eager to cast him aside.</p><p>Her behavior upset her so much that she\u2019d talked to her father about the strong attraction she felt for Cal. In retrospect, Linnette was happy to get advice from her dad; her mother would\u2019ve said I told you so a dozen times.</p><p>Her father\u2019s advice, however, had left her slightly confused. He\u2019d said something about fate stepping in, putting Cal in her path. When she did see him she\u2019d apologize, which she wanted to do anyway\u2014she just wasn\u2019t sure how or when. She hoped he\u2019d ask her out again. The only alternative would be to make the first overture. She didn\u2019t know if she could.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a man who needs stitches in the surgery,\u201d Sally Lynch, the LPN, said.</p><p>Linnette grabbed the man\u2019s chart. She\u2019d taken one step into the small surgery when she read Cal\u2019s name on the computer printout. Just a few seconds earlier, he\u2019d been foremost in her mind. She remembered what her father had said, and her heart started to beat fast. If it was meant to be, Cal would come back into her life.</p><p>And here he was!</p><p>Maintaining a calm facade, she pulled the curtain aside and discovered that the palm of his left hand had been sliced open. The wound had been prepped and was ready to be sutured. It was an ugly cut and no doubt painful.</p><p>\u201cHello, Cal,\u201d she said, moving into the room.</p><p>He closed his eyes and turned his head; he didn\u2019t acknowledge her greeting.</p><p>Ignoring his lack of warmth, she sat down on the stool to examine the cut. \u201cI think we\u2019re looking at ten or eleven stitches here.\u201d She glanced at his face. \u201cDo you want to tell me how you did this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Linnette had the feeling that, given the opportunity, he would gladly have walked out the door. She wasn\u2019t about to let that happen.</p><p>\u201cActually, I was hoping I\u2019d run into you,\u201d she said, reaching for the needle to numb his hand.</p><p>\u201cI b-bet,\u201d he muttered from between clenched teeth.</p><p>Linnette waited until she\u2019d finished giving him the Novocaine. \u201cI feel I owe you an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone n-n-necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were nothing but kind to me and I was exceedingly rude.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t comment one way or the other.</p><p>The first suture went in without a problem. \u201cI\u2019ve felt badly about it ever since,\u201d she said, tying off the second stitch.</p><p>He remained uncommunicative while she continued to speak in even tones that belied her physical response to him. She wasn\u2019t sure how to tell a man who worked in a barn how badly she missed his scent. She didn\u2019t realize it until she caught a whiff of fresh alfalfa and what she suspected was a combination of man and horse.</p><p>Neither of them spoke during the next three sutures. Linnette wanted to ask if he\u2019d thought of her at all, but she feared the answer even more than the question. After the cold way she\u2019d treated him, he didn\u2019t want anything more to do with her; she was convinced of it. Still, she felt she had to say something else.</p><p>\u201cI, uh, wondered if I\u2019d see you again,\u201d she said as she tied off the last of the sutures.</p><p>Once more he left her comment hanging. She wrapped the wound and gave him instructions on taking care of it. Cal worked with his hands so he\u2019d have to be extra careful to keep the cut clean and protected.</p><p>In his eagerness to escape, he all but vaulted out of his seat when she stopped speaking.</p><p>\u201cCal,\u201d she said sternly before he could bolt.</p><p>Exasperated, he turned back. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need a follow-up appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to remove those stitches and inspect the cut.\u201d</p><p>He whirled away, prepared to leave again.</p><p>This time Linnette stepped in front of the door, blocking his exit. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have that looked at in about a week.\u201d He stood no more than a foot away. His presence nearly overwhelmed her and she thought her heart might stop beating. He seemed to be staring straight through her. She hoped he was; then he\u2019d know she was sincere. If her eyes told him anything, she wanted it to be an apology\u2014wanted him to know she regretted the things she\u2019d said and done at their last meeting.</p><p>Neither moved until it became apparent that there was someone on the other side of the door. Linnette shifted as Sally came into the room and nearly collided with Cal.</p><p>\u201cSally, Mr. Washburn will need a follow-up appointment,\u201d she said, her throat so tight the words came out sounding strangled.</p><p>\u201cUh, sure thing.\u201d Sally regarded her closely. She knew as well as Linnette did that such appointments were handled by the receptionist and not the nursing staff. \u201cCome with me, Mr. Washburn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d Linnette forced out the words as Cal walked past her.</p><p>Again he didn\u2019t respond to her or the unspoken plea evident in her remark.</p><p>When Cal strode into the waiting area, with Sally trotting behind him, Linnette felt she needed to sit down. Strangely, she yearned to run after him and demand to know if he\u2019d kissed other women the way he\u2019d kissed her. It was a ridiculous question and since she\u2019d already made a fool of herself once today, she figured that was her limit.</p><p>Once she regained her composure, she walked out to the receptionist\u2019s desk and looked over Marilyn\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDid Cal Washburn make a follow-up appointment?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe man who came in with the cut hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him. He didn\u2019t, did he?\u201d Linnette wasn\u2019t sure why she bothered to ask. She would\u2019ve been shocked if he had. Cal had made it as plain as possible; he wasn\u2019t interested in seeing her again.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Marilyn said. \u201cSally tried to talk him into it, but he said he could take the stitches out himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinnette.\u201d</p><p>Chad called her and, surprised, she turned to face him. \u201cI was hoping to see you when you\u2019ve got a free moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now is fine,\u201d she said and even managed to sound professional.</p><p>Chad touched her shoulder, guiding her to the side of the hallway that led to the cubicles and the surgery. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to talk to you for a while now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t quite meet her eyes, which told her this wasn\u2019t going to be a pleasant conversation.</p><p>\u201cIs there a problem with my work?\u201d This was her immediate concern, although she couldn\u2019t think of a single incident in which her ability as a P.A. might be questioned.</p><p>\u201cNo, no, nothing like that.\u201d Still he hesitated. \u201cPerhaps we could get a cup of coffee after work.\u201d</p><p>Had he asked her this as little as three weeks ago, she would\u2019ve leapt at the suggestion.</p> <p>\u201cIs tonight convenient?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cAh...I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, you can\u2019t go back there.\u201d Sally\u2019s voice rang down the hallway.</p><p>Linnette spun around and saw Cal.</p><p>His eyes narrowed as he read the physician\u2019s name tag.</p> <p>Linnette straightened. Chad had kept his voice low in order to talk privately and she\u2019d leaned close so she could hear him. Anyone happening upon them would\u2019ve assumed they were deep in conversation\u2014a confidential, perhaps even intimate, conversation.</p><p>\u201cNo p-problem,\u201d Cal said, and with that he wheeled around and walked out the door.</p><p>Once more Linnette resisted the urge to run after him. She hated to let this relationship go, but no longer felt she had any other choice.</p><p>Thirty-Five</p><p>On Valentine\u2019s Day, Grace drove out to visit Olivia rather than head home to an empty house. Jack had recently returned from the hospital where he\u2019d had bypass surgery, and poor Olivia had her hands full. Apparently Jack wasn\u2019t a good patient, which came as no surprise to Grace. Or Olivia either, Grace assumed.</p><p>She rang the doorbell and waited a few minutes before Olivia answered, flustered and unkempt, which was completely unlike her. She stared at Grace and her small bouquet of red carnations and seemed about to burst into tears.</p> <p>\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve had a rough day,\u201d Grace said sympathetically.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it,\u201d Olivia muttered under her breath.</p><p>Jack sat in the living room, arms crossed and eyes flashing defiance.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Grace said, glancing from one to the other. \u201cDid I come at a bad time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Olivia insisted.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jack countered.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should come back later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Olivia said, glaring at her husband.</p> <p>Jack sighed his capitulation. \u201cYou might as well stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack Griffin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Grace.\u201d He rolled his eyes. \u201cI just wonder if you know how stubborn your best friend can be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d Grace feigned shock. \u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEt tu, Brute!\u201d Olivia muttered.</p><p>Grace handed her the flowers and while her friend retreated to the kitchen to find a vase, she sat down across from Jack. \u201cA little overprotective, is she?\u201d</p><p>He snickered softly. \u201cHow\u2019d you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Olivia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s become my shadow. I can\u2019t even take a\u2014use the bathroom without her running after me to make sure I\u2019m not going to keel over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a natural reaction, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Grace asked. \u201cShe nearly lost you, in case you\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s suffocating me.\u201d</p><p>Olivia poked her head around the kitchen door. \u201cAre you talking about me behind my back?\u201d</p><p>Grace wasn\u2019t about to lie. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Olivia frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him. Jack\u2019s trying to do too much too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m following doctor\u2019s orders,\u201d Jack shouted. He turned his attention to Grace again. \u201cTell her to go back to work. I need some breathing space.\u201d</p><p>Grace disagreed. \u201cLet her fuss over you. She needs to do that.\u201d</p><p>Jack regarded her, then slowly shook his head. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace, would you like a cup of tea?\u201d Olivia called.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take coffee,\u201d Jack said.</p><p>\u201cGreen tea is better for you.\u201d</p><p>He started to argue but apparently changed his mind. \u201cWhatever you think, dear.\u201d</p><p>This time Olivia came all the way out of the kitchen. She pointed at Grace. \u201cWhat did you say to him?\u201d</p><p>Holding back a smile, Grace said airily, \u201cOh, just that you love him.\u201d</p><p>Olivia\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m reconsidering that. In all my born days, I\u2019ve never known a man as pigheaded as Jack Griffin.\u201d</p><p>Grace would hear none of it. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy about this man. You love him\u2014you can\u2019t help loving him.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, Olivia laughed. \u201cI do, and he knows it.\u201d</p><p>A smug look came over Jack. \u201cThe thing is, I love her, too.\u201d He held out his hand to Olivia, who clasped it firmly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d She sniffled, then abruptly went back to the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWe argue,\u201d Jack said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s used to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t,\u201d Grace told him. Her friend, the judge, liked order and control; she rarely raised her voice or lost her cool. Marrying Jack had changed all that.</p><p>\u201cBut we make up, too,\u201d Jack added. \u201cThat\u2019s the best part.\u201d He jiggled his eyebrows for effect.</p><p>Grace smiled. Her friend\u2019s marriage might not be perfect, but she\u2019d never seen Olivia happier. Jack was exactly the kind of man she needed in her life\u2014irreverent, confrontational and fun.</p><p>\u201cThe tea will be ready in a minute,\u201d Olivia said from the kitchen.</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes softened and he seemed to have forgotten that Grace was in the room. After a moment, he said, \u201cI was sorry to hear about you and Cliff.\u201d</p><p>Rather than comment, Grace nodded. It still hurt to think about Cliff. Much as she wanted to, she couldn\u2019t dismiss him completely from her thoughts. In time, she reasoned, that would get easier.</p><p>\u201cThings just didn\u2019t work out,\u201d she said as if it were a minor occurrence.</p><p>Olivia returned then, carrying a tray with three filled cups and a plate of oatmeal cookies.</p><p>\u201cNone for you,\u201d she announced to Jack the instant his eyes widened with delight.</p><p>\u201cThis is cruel and unusual punishment,\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor wants you down twenty-five pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho made you the diet police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. Do you want to argue some more?\u201d she asked as she passed him a cup of tea.</p><p>\u201cNo, but it\u2019s downright mean of you to tempt me.\u201d</p><p>Olivia sighed. \u201cAll right, you can have one cookie.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Jack set down the tea, he grabbed Olivia about the waist and pulled her onto his lap.</p><p>She let out a squeal of protest, then threw her arms around his neck. \u201cDo I need to remind you we have company?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAm I embarrassing you?\u201d Jack asked his wife.</p><p>\u201cTerribly.\u201d</p><p>He grinned as if that had been his purpose all along. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Olivia struggled into an upright position, patted her hair and then gave Grace her tea with an air of refinement.</p><p>Grace stayed long enough to drink her tea and have a cookie and then left. On her way home, she fought a deepening depression. This was Valentine\u2019s Day, and she was alone again. She\u2019d been alone for the last four years, but this year it felt a hundred times worse. Dan had never been much of a gift-giver. He\u2019d made a few attempts over the years but she couldn\u2019t recall a single Valentine card he\u2019d given her, or flowers.</p><p>Buttercup and Sherlock were at the door to greet her. They always showed great enthusiasm about having her home and she rewarded them both with lots of praise and attention. After filling their dishes, she turned on the television. She wasn\u2019t interested in any of the programs, but the TV provided company, the sound of people talking and laughing.</p><p>When the doorbell chimed an hour or so later, she didn\u2019t know who it could be. She wasn\u2019t expecting anyone. Opening the front door, she saw Cliff, and her breath caught. After a slight hesitation, while she fortified her resolve, she opened the door.</p><p>He waited on her porch, a bouquet of red roses in hand. At this time of year, Grace knew those flowers must have cost a fortune.</p><p>Without a word, he opened the screen door and stepped into the house. He held out the roses. \u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>The desire to welcome him back into her life felt like an undertow, about to drag her beneath the waves. She took a deep breath as they just stood there, inside her front door. \u201cI love you, Cliff\u2014but no.\u201d</p><p>Her answer appeared to shock him. \u201cYou won\u2019t even talk to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? So you can apologize and then two weeks or two months down the road repeat the same behavior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen again. You have my word on that.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to believe him, but she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>He must have felt her indecision. \u201cI love you, Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you do, but you don\u2019t trust me.\u201d</p><p>Cliff removed his Stetson and studied the floor. \u201cI told you what my marriage was like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve told you I\u2019m not Susan. I made a mistake and I\u2019ve paid dearly for it. I\u2019m sorry, Cliff, truly sorry, but I think you should leave.\u201d Her voice faltered, but her determination didn\u2019t.</p><p>He nodded, replacing his hat. \u201cWhen you said we were through, I thought breaking it off completely might be for the best. What you said was right on target. The way I treated you wasn\u2019t intentional\u2014but in a sense it was. I see that now. I suppose I was hoping you\u2019d put an end to the relationship....\u201d</p><p>His honesty hurt, but she kept her chin high and didn\u2019t comment. He confirmed everything she\u2019d suspected.</p><p>\u201cThen you were out of my life, and I was more miserable than before. Every day I found myself missing you so much. I had a hole in my heart and in my life. I realized I was the biggest fool on earth to let you go.\u201d He paused, shaking his head. \u201cLisa and I talk every week. Sometimes she knows me better than I do myself. She said if I let you walk away, I\u2019d regret it the rest of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Lisa prompted this?\u201d Cliff loved his daughter and listened to her when he would listen to no one else.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cShe was just telling me what I already knew.\u201d Before Grace could speak, he told her, \u201cLisa isn\u2019t the only one. Cal said either I patch things up with you or he\u2019s quitting.\u201d</p><p>Grace managed a half smile. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it. If you turn down my proposal, Grace, I might as well not go home.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her eyes. If Cliff Harding was proposing to her on Valentine\u2019s Day, she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever forgive him for being so romantic. He made it almost impossible to say no.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Grace,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t live without you any longer. I tried, but nothing seemed any good. I\u2019m working hard\u2014and for what? I don\u2019t need the money. At the end of the day, I walk in from the cold and the house is dark and lonely. That\u2019s the way I feel without you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grace closed her eyes rather than look at him.</p><p>\u201cI want to love you, live with you, travel with you.\u201d</p><p>She longed to say yes, she really did, but she was afraid....</p><p>\u201cYou said, when you made dinner on New Year\u2019s Day, that you were going to ask me to marry you. I\u2019d give anything to have been here. I\u2019d give anything to have the chance to hear that proposal because, my darling, the answer is yes.\u201d</p> <p>His reminder was the dash of reality she needed. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to ask you, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, and I\u2019m sorry every day for being such a jackass. Then again, I\u2019m just old-fashioned enough to do the asking. Grace Sherman, I love you and I want to marry you. Will you be my wife?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her hand to her mouth and blinked rapidly. Loneliness had been her constant companion since Dan\u2019s disappearance. Here was the opportunity to end that. Without his saying it, she knew that if she refused, she\u2019d never see Cliff again. He\u2019d leave, and it truly would be over.</p><p>\u201cWill you?\u201d he asked, his eyes pleading with her.</p><p>Grace sobbed once and nodded. \u201cYes, oh, yes.\u201d Before she could draw another breath, she was in Cliff\u2019s embrace, crushing the roses between them. He kissed her until she was weak in his arms, and then whispered in her ear, \u201cI hope you don\u2019t believe in long engagements.\u201d</p> <p>She laughed and hugged him tight. \u201cI was thinking the very same thing.\u201d</p><p>Thirty-Six</p><p>Cecilia met her friend Cathy for lunch on Saturday afternoon at the Pancake Palace. They served a really nice meal for a reasonable price. Cecilia had been feeling low all week and was badly in need of a pep talk.</p><p>Cathy was waiting for her when Cecilia walked in. She sat toward the back of the room in a booth, waving vigorously. Her four-year-old son wasn\u2019t with her, which surprised Cecilia.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Andy?\u201d she asked as she slid into the booth. Seven months into her pregnancy, there was no disguising the fact any longer. There wasn\u2019t an inch to spare between her protruding belly and the table. In another few weeks, it\u2019d be too tight a squeeze and she wouldn\u2019t be able to sit in a booth anymore.</p><p>\u201cAndy\u2019s with friends on a play date,\u201d Cathy explained. \u201cI have all afternoon free, so after lunch we can do something fun.\u201d She seemed almost giddy at the thought.</p> <p>Cecilia wished she shared her excitement. To hide her mood, she reached for the menu tucked behind the napkin canister. Nothing looked appetizing but she made a decision.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Cathy asked. \u201cShopping? A movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither would be great,\u201d she said, forcing some enthusiasm into her voice. \u201cYou decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShopping then,\u201d Cathy announced.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds perfect.\u201d Already Cecilia felt better. \u201cThe mall or the commissary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mall,\u201d Cathy decided. \u201cWe won\u2019t be as likely to run into someone who\u2019ll want to tag along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind, you know.\u201d Cathy was such a cheerful person to be around that she naturally attracted people.</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d her friend said. \u201cYou and I need quality time together. That\u2019s what Andrew always says about him and me\u2014but most of our quality time is spent in the bedroom.\u201d She smiled as she said it.</p> <p>The waitress came for their order; Cathy asked for the seafood salad and Cecilia ordered the turkey wrap with a cup of vegetable beef soup. As soon as the woman had brought their drinks\u2014sparkling water for both\u2014Cathy folded her hands on the table and leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think anything\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Cathy studied her carefully. \u201cI can see it in your eyes. Besides, when you phoned, you didn\u2019t sound very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Cecilia confessed.</p><p>\u201cIan and the baby again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe refuses to decide on a name,\u201d Cecilia blurted out. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, and oh\u2014he\u2019s just so frustrating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows the baby\u2019s a boy. So what\u2019s his problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been after him for weeks to give me suggestions for names and he just ignores me. Finally I sent him a list of my favorites and he ignored that, too.\u201d This was the one thing Cecilia disliked about e-mail. Whatever he didn\u2019t want to answer, he simply ignored.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Cathy asked. \u201cWait until after the baby arrives? You can\u2019t call him Baby Randall for the rest of his life, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know. I told Ian he had his opportunity and if he wasn\u2019t going to make any suggestions, I\u2019d choose the name I liked best without him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Cathy said, her eyes sparkling with curiosity, \u201cwhat name have you chosen?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia placed her hand on her belly. \u201cAaron. Aaron Randall has a good sound, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like it,\u201d Cathy said, testing the name on her tongue. \u201cAaron Randall. Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan\u2019s middle name is Jacob and I thought we\u2019d use that for the baby\u2019s middle name, too.\u201d</p><p>Cathy nodded her approval. \u201cDoes Ian have a problem with Aaron Jacob?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cFor weeks he refused to discuss names and when I told him fine, I\u2019d do it without him, he didn\u2019t respond. But the minute he heard the name Aaron he went nuts. I told him about it when he called last week,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he like the name?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia was embarrassed to repeat what he\u2019d said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want a name that begins with the letter A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Cathy muttered, and then her eyes widened. \u201cOh. He\u2019s upset because Allison\u2019s name began with A?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d The waitress delivered their meals and Cecilia thanked her with a smile.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that being a little superstitious?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s so afraid, and it\u2019s really starting to bother me. I like the name Aaron. When I first went back to school, I had a teacher at Olympic College who encouraged me. If it hadn\u2019t been for Mr. Cavanaugh, I would\u2019ve dropped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis first name was Aaron?\u201d Cathy guessed.</p><p>Cecilia took a bite of her wrap, which was actually quite tasty. \u201cHe became my advisor and steered me toward the bookkeeping classes. I think he must be a friend of Mr. Cox\u2019s, too, because I was hired after Mr. Cavanaugh suggested I apply for the position.\u201d The math professor had been more of a father to Cecilia than her own, and she wanted him to know how much his encouragement had meant to her. She kept in touch with him, sending a Christmas card each year. She\u2019d mail him a baby announcement and thank him again for his kindness.</p><p>\u201cIan had his chance to name the baby.\u201d Cecilia tried a spoonful of soup. \u201cI tried and tried to get him to discuss names and the only reaction I got was that he didn\u2019t like Aaron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, like you said, he\u2019s afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be fine,\u201d she insisted, as though she had to convince herself as well as Cathy. \u201cThe baby will, too.\u201d She\u2019d already begun to think of the baby as Aaron, and the name was a perfectly good one.</p><p>Half an hour later, Cecilia and Cathy left the Pancake Palace and drove to Silverdale, to the Kitsap Mall. Neither of them had much extra money, so they just browsed in the baby departments. Cecilia did buy some little undershirts that were on sale.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m concerned about Allison Cox,\u201d Cecilia said as they passed a record store and saw a display of DVDs. \u201cI think I told you. She\u2019s fallen for this kid who looks like he\u2019s stepped right out of The Matrix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something highly attractive about a bad boy,\u201d Cathy said and although she was teasing, Cecilia knew it was true. The attraction was certainly there for Allison.</p><p>\u201cI thought you told me they aren\u2019t allowed to see each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t, and it\u2019s killing Allison. She comes in after school and moans on and on about how hard this is. I listen and try to be sympathetic, but that boy is bad news. I\u2019m just grateful Mr. Cox put his foot down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your concern?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia swung her small plastic bag. \u201cMr. Cox and Anson have an agreement and, when that\u2019s fulfilled, Anson can see Allison again. The poor girl\u2019s living for that day. I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s setting herself up for a big disappointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re borrowing trouble,\u201d Cathy told her as they strolled past a display of baby furniture. \u201cBut on another subject, what do you hear from Rachel Pendergast these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much,\u201d Cecilia said. As soon as Rachel had learned that Nate\u2019s father was a United States Congressman, she\u2019d broken off the relationship. Cecilia still planned to go to Rachel for her haircuts, but it\u2019d been two or three weeks since she\u2019d talked to her.</p><p>\u201cI take it she\u2019s running scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Cecilia paused to run her hand over the side of the display crib. She already had Aaron\u2019s room set up and had purchased a used crib from a secondhand store. Everything was prepared and waiting for her son, although she hadn\u2019t bought many new things.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you wonder how young parents can afford all this?\u201d she mused aloud.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t. This is for grandmas to buy,\u201d Cathy said with a smile. \u201cAfter Andy was born, Andrew and I flew home to visit my parents, and they\u2019d bought a crib for him to sleep in while we were there. A brand-new one! Andrew and I bought a secondhand crib that he painted white. I did the best I could with decals, but it didn\u2019t look half as good as any of these. We got a real kick out of the fact that my parents had a brand-new crib and we had a used one.\u201d</p><p>They left the mall after a couple of hours and no other purchases. Cathy needed to get back to pick up Andy. Cecilia headed home, then changed her mind and drove to the cemetery where Allison was buried.</p><p>Cecilia made sure the grave site was always well maintained. In the first year, she\u2019d visited at least once a week and brought flowers. These days she didn\u2019t come as frequently, but her daughter was never far from her thoughts.</p><p>Cecilia stooped down and with her gloved hands brushed some wet leaves from the grave marker. \u201cHello, sweetheart,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s Mommy and your little brother.\u201d The baby moved inside her as if to add his own greeting. \u201cYour daddy\u2019s being stubborn again.\u201d She nearly choked on the words, surprised by the emotion that rose inside her whenever she talked to Allison. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, though,\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe\u2019ll be all right.\u201d She straightened, placing both hands on her lower back. A moment later, she returned to the car, her head bent against the February wind.</p><p>Thirty-Seven</p><p>Jack rolled his leather chair up to his desk and sighed at the sheer pleasure of getting back to work. Damn, this was where he belonged. He inhaled a deep breath, glancing around the busy newsroom.</p><p>Olivia had made a real stink about his returning to the office. He\u2019d placated her as best he could and promised he\u2019d work only a half day. If he wasn\u2019t home by noon, he was afraid she\u2019d send the sheriff after him. Troy Davis would do it, too. He\u2019d probably delight in hauling Jack out of the office in full sight of any and all onlookers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His assistant editor, Steve Fullerton, came up to his desk, carrying an insulated coffee cup. \u201cListen, Jack. I need to talk to you about the Lifestyle feature. We couldn\u2019t get the photos and...\u201d He grinned widely. \u201cHey, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Jack was embarrassed by the fuss his staff had made. His desk was covered with flowers and cards, and they\u2019d hung a banner overhead with gold letters that said Welcome Back. It was nice to know he\u2019d been missed.</p><p>By ten, he was completely immersed in the routine of getting out a daily paper. It seemed as if he\u2019d never been away. He wrote an editorial and praised the quick response of the local EMTs who\u2019d saved his life. His fingers flew on the keyboard. He\u2019d always composed his best editorials under time constraints; in fact, Jack had spent most of his career under the gun and thrived with the pressure\u2014or so he\u2019d once believed. This recent scare made him rethink that assumption.</p><p>At noon, the Lifestyle article had to be dumped, they needed to come up with something new and there was a one o\u2019clock deadline. Olivia would be furious if he stayed longer than he\u2019d promised. He weighed her anger against his inclination to pitch in with everyone else. Jack was still trying to decide what to do when Bob Beldon strolled in.</p> <p>\u201cJack,\u201d Bob said, heading straight for Jack\u2019s desk. \u201cI was in the neighborhood and thought I\u2019d stop by, see how you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned. Bob just happened to be in the neighborhood. Not likely. He knew this visit was no accident. \u201cOlivia sent you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>A chagrined look spread over Bob\u2019s face and he nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I figured.\u201d Leave it to his wife.</p><p>\u201cShe said I was to drag you out of here kicking and screaming if necessary. You aren\u2019t going to make me do that, are you?\u201d</p> <p>Jack groaned in protest, but Bob was the best friend he\u2019d ever have in this life. He knew when he was beat. Grumbling under his breath, he turned off his computer, then stood and reached for his jacket. He just hoped his wife and his friend knew how hard it was for him to walk away in the middle of a crisis.</p><p>The staff looked on in disbelief. He\u2019d never abandoned them, never left before every deadline was met, every detail attended to. Steve Fullerton actually started a round of applause, and Jack gave a mock bow, waving on his way out the door.</p><p>\u201cSee you tomorrow, old man,\u201d Steve called. \u201cTry to stay alive for another few days.\u201d</p><p>Jack wouldn\u2019t admit it, but he was exhausted. During his recovery, Olivia had insisted he take a nap every afternoon. In the beginning he\u2019d defied her because he resented being \u201cordered around like a kid.\u201d Little good that did him, since he fell asleep anyway, and always slept at least an hour.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do with myself now?\u201d Jack muttered as he and Bob went to the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d invite myself over so the two of us could play a few games of cribbage. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p> <p>The last comment was a reminder that Jack had been working too hard for too long. The job hadn\u2019t started out like that, and yet within five years he\u2019d managed to work himself into a heart attack.</p><p>\u201cCribbage sounds like a fine idea,\u201d Jack said. \u201cJust promise to be gentle with me. My skills are pretty rusty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo mercy,\u201d Bob teased. \u201cFor once, I have the advantage and I\u2019m taking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be.\u201d Jack laughed. It felt good to be with his friend, who was also his AA sponsor and all-around mentor.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, the crisis at the office was forgotten as Jack stared at the cards in his hand, deciding which two to discard. He chewed on the end of a toothpick, a habit Olivia detested, and set aside the six and the three.</p><p>The phone interrupted his concentration. \u201cTen bucks says that\u2019s Olivia checking to see if I\u2019m home,\u201d Jack muttered, glancing over the top of his cards.</p><p>Bob chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>Jack grabbed for the receiver. \u201cYes, sweetheart?\u201d</p> <p>Olivia gave a small gasp. \u201cHow\u2019d you know it was me?\u201d</p><p>Jack held out his palm to his friend, indicating that Bob should pay up. \u201cLucky guess,\u201d he answered his wife. \u201cI\u2019m home, and my babysitter\u2019s doing a fine job of looking after me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBob is not your babysitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I required to nap this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>She ignored the question. \u201cHow did it go at the office?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat, really great.\u201d He dared not let her know how much he loved being back at work. The frantic pace stimulated him. Afternoon naps\u2014even if he needed them\u2014didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cAre you tired?\u201d</p><p>He smothered a yawn. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m sitting here in the middle of the day playing cutthroat cribbage with Bob Beldon. There\u2019s nothing else I\u2019d rather be doing.\u201d</p><p>Not true. He\u2019d rather be at work\u2014or making love to his wife\u2014but that was another area that appeared to be taboo since his surgery. The only time he\u2019d mentioned the possibility, Olivia was the one who damn near had a heart attack. Absolutely no sex. Apparently even talking about it was off limits. As far as he could figure, he\u2019d been cut off for the rest of his natural life. Sex wasn\u2019t all, either. He hadn\u2019t seen a piece of red meat in weeks.</p><p>\u201cSee how you feel after Bob leaves,\u201d she suggested. \u201cYou sound a little cranky.\u201d</p><p>There she went again, treating him like a five-year-old. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you get back to work?\u201d he asked, hoping to get her off the phone before he lost his temper.</p><p>\u201cNot really\u2014I\u2019m on my lunch hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re interrupting our game,\u201d he said. He suspected Olivia had given Bob instructions on how long he should stay. Although Olivia\u2019s actions were prompted by love, everything she\u2019d said and done since the surgery felt like a noose being tightened around his neck.</p><p>\u201cHave a good afternoon, sweetheart, and I\u2019ll be home soon after five.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to tell her not to rush on his account, but it wouldn\u2019t do any good. Olivia was on a mission and unfortunately that mission was to save him from himself.</p><p>Jack replaced the receiver, closed his eyes a moment in an effort to reduce his blood pressure, then picked up his cribbage hand.</p><p>\u201cSo how\u2019d you know it was Olivia?\u201d Bob asked, placing a ten-dollar bill on the coffee table.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s smothering me with attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Bob returned with a skeptical look. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind Peggy giving me a little extra TLC.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d mind this.\u201d That was all Jack was willing to say on the subject.</p><p>True to her word, Olivia was home at twelve minutes past five. Jack knew for a fact that the drive from the courthouse to Lighthouse Road took exactly eleven minutes. That meant she was out the door at the stroke of five, in her car and racing away from the office.</p><p>Jack sat in front of the television. He found daytime TV asinine. It seemed largely populated by the stupid and the shameless. One more talk show or courtroom program and he was going to leap off a bridge.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, coming through the front door. Studying him for any signs of\u2014what?\u2014she removed her gloves and hung up her coat. \u201cDid you have your nap?\u201d</p><p>Jack clamped his jaw rather than comment.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can get you?\u201d she asked next.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His response was automatic. \u201cI want a kiss. A real kiss.\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for only a moment. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that peck-on-the-cheek stuff, either. I want\u2014no, I need\u2014a kiss from my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack...I don\u2019t think this is a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to believe it\u2019s a mighty fine one.\u201d Slowly he got up from the chair. If she wouldn\u2019t come to him, he\u2019d go to her.</p><p>Olivia must have recognized the determination in his eyes because she backed away from him until she could go no farther. Pressed against the wall, her eyes wide with alarm, she whispered, \u201cJack...\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t allow her to finish. She stiffened when he brought his mouth to hers and kissed her for all he was worth. Her lips were soft and pliant, and it wasn\u2019t long before he felt her relax. She sighed; soon her arms were around his neck and they were completely caught up in each other.</p><p>Jack was just beginning to wonder how difficult it would be to unfasten her blouse and free her breasts. He loved the feel of Olivia\u2019s breasts; the weight of them in his hands was about as close to heaven as he figured he\u2019d get. Suddenly the oddest thing happened.</p><p>Olivia started to weep.</p><p>These weren\u2019t ordinary tears, either. Her shoulders heaved with sobs as she clung to him, kissing him as though she couldn\u2019t stop. A moment later, she was crying so hard she had to pull away in order to breathe. With her head against his chest, her arms circling his middle, she continued to weep.</p><p>\u201cOlivia?\u201d he asked anxiously. He\u2019d never seen her cry like this, never known her capable of this heart-wrenching kind of grief. His hands were in her hair as he tried to comfort her.</p><p>\u201cI almost lost you,\u201d she managed to say between hiccuping sobs. \u201cJack, oh Jack, please, please, don\u2019t ever do that to me again.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and tightened his hold on her.</p><p>\u201cAll I could think about was losing you...I kept remembering the day Jordan drowned and...don\u2019t leave me, Jack! Don\u2019t leave me, I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never leave you,\u201d he assured her, still stroking her hair.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d he promised. \u201cI\u2019ll never leave you, Olivia.\u201d And, God willing, he\u2019d keep his word.</p><p>Thirty-Eight</p><p>\u201cRoy, would you fill the water glasses?\u201d Corrie called from the kitchen. Their company was due any minute, and she was decidedly flustered.</p><p>They were having the Beldons over, and cooking for someone like Peggy Beldon was a challenge. Peggy\u2019s skill in the kitchen was worthy of her own cooking show on the Food Network. What did one serve a culinary virtuoso?</p><p>After days of flipping through cookbooks, Corrie chose baked halibut with wild rice and fresh green beans. Dessert was coconut cake, using Charlotte Jefferson\u2019s recipe. With this cake, Charlotte had apparently won the blue ribbon in the Kitsap County Fair five years running. Corrie didn\u2019t doubt it. If the cake tasted half as divine as it looked and smelled, even Peggy would be impressed.</p><p>\u201cDone,\u201d Roy said, holding an empty water pitcher in his hand. \u201cAnything else you need me to do?\u201d</p><p>Corrie stepped back and surveyed the dining room. The presentation was elegant, if she did say so herself. A fresh flower arrangement sat in the middle of the mahogany table, which was covered with a pale-yellow linen cloth. Matching napkins were folded into the shape of birds about to take flight. Corrie had picked up this neat trick watching a Martha Stewart show a few years back. The simplicity of it had attracted her. Their very best china and silverware were laid out for their guests. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The doorbell chimed, and Corrie drew in a calming breath. She didn\u2019t know why she\u2019d worried so much. It wasn\u2019t a competition, and Peggy wasn\u2019t critical. She supposed her own perfectionism was the culprit; that and her desire to make sure their friends had a wonderful time.</p><p>Roy welcomed the Beldons. After he\u2019d taken Bob and Peggy\u2019s coats, they all gathered in the living room and Corrie brought out an appetizer. It was an easy recipe she\u2019d gotten off a package of cream cheese. You started with fresh Oregon shrimp mixed with cocktail sauce and heaped it all on a block of the softened cream cheese. Small crisp crackers were arranged around it.</p><p>Roy took a bottle of white wine from the refrigerator and poured three glasses. Bob had a soda. It didn\u2019t seem to bother him that wine was served, although Corrie was sensitive to the fact that their friend was a recovering alcoholic. Bob had assured them it wasn\u2019t a problem the last time they\u2019d had the Beldons to dinner, which was\u2014oh, she was embarrassed by how long it\u2019d been. The night of the fruit basket, as she always thought of it now. Last October...</p><p>They toasted one another and made small talk for a while, just catching up on life.</p> <p>\u201cDo you ever hear from Hannah Russell?\u201d Roy asked. He sat next to Corrie, his arm draped around her shoulders.</p><p>Hannah was a young woman who\u2019d lived with the Beldons the previous year. Her father had died two years earlier at the Thyme and Tide, and his death had shaken the entire community\u2014especially when it was revealed to be no accident, no natural death. Max Russell had been murdered. No one was more shaken than Bob, who appeared to be a suspect at the beginning.</p><p>Even now Corrie didn\u2019t understand all the connections. She knew Max and Bob had served together in Vietnam; Dan Sherman had been with their unit, too. So was a fourth man, now a colonel. The men had held on to a terrible secret\u2014a massacre in a remote village. They\u2019d all been involved and, needless to say, none of them had ever gotten over it. They\u2019d handled that unbearable memory in different ways. With Bob it had been drinking....</p><p>Dan was the first to die. His death, however, had been a suicide. Then Max was murdered, and there were all sorts of questions and misconceptions regarding his death.</p><p>The shocking truth about Max\u2019s death came later, when it was learned that his own daughter had killed him. No one had been more stunned than Peggy, who\u2019d befriended the girl and welcomed her into their home. The Beldons had let Hannah live with them, helped her find employment, encouraged and supported her.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to Hannah in months,\u201d Peggy said, and her words rang with sadness. \u201cI\u2019ve written her any number of times, but she never answers. The last I heard, she\u2019d been taken to California to await sentencing for her mother\u2019s death.\u201d Hannah had initially tried to engineer her father\u2019s death by having a friend tamper with his car, but it was her mother who\u2019d died.</p><p>\u201cPeggy was in court when Hannah accepted the plea agreement.\u201d Bob shook his head in confusion. \u201cSomehow Hannah blames us for her arrest.\u201d</p><p>Peggy bit her lip. \u201cI still find it hard to believe that Hannah could murder her parents.\u201d</p><p>Roy didn\u2019t respond, and Corrie knew why. Her husband was the one who\u2019d long suspected the girl\u2019s involvement in the murder. The only reason Hannah had come to Cedar Cove was to keep track of the investigation. Meanwhile, she\u2019d fooled people by acting timid and vulnerable, a little girl lost.</p><p>\u201cMax\u2019s death wasn\u2019t the only mystery in this town,\u201d Bob commented, sipping his soda. \u201cAs I recall, the last time we were at dinner here, someone left a package at your front door.\u201d</p><p>Peggy brought her hand to her throat. \u201cYou frightened us because you thought that fruit basket might contain a bomb or something.\u201d</p> <p>Roy\u2019s smile was forced. \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever find out who was responsible?\u201d</p><p>Corrie looked at her husband.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d was all Roy would say.</p><p>\u201cI hope this wasn\u2019t confidential, but Corrie told Peggy you\u2019d been receiving anonymous postcards,\u201d Bob said. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that\u2019s still going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe most recent one arrived on Valentine\u2019s Day,\u201d Corrie answered when it seemed that Roy wouldn\u2019t. The subject made them both uncomfortable. The card had actually been a valentine and the message inside had read: ROSES ARE RED, VIOLETS ARE BLUE, I KNOW WHO I AM\u2014DON\u2019T YOU?</p><p>Bob frowned and shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a clue who\u2019s doing this?\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded. \u201cWe have an idea.\u201d</p> <p>Just then the oven timer buzzed. The timing couldn\u2019t have been better as far as Corrie was concerned. \u201cI believe that\u2019s our cue to move into the dining room.\u201d</p><p>The evening was enjoyable and they lingered over drinks until Bob suggested cards. Roy set up the card table while Corrie got out the deck. They played pinochle, the women against the men. After the first game they paused for coffee and dessert, and Corrie promised to write out the coconut cake recipe for Peggy. They were just finishing when Linnette arrived.</p><p>Their daughter seemed surprised that her parents had guests. \u201cOh, sorry,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cHi, Peggy, Bob. I didn\u2019t realize Mom and Dad had company.\u201d</p><p>Corrie immediately knew that something had upset her. \u201cShould I call you later?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d Peggy said, reading the situation perfectly. She carried her empty cake plate and cup to the kitchen. \u201cIt\u2019s time Bob and I went home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is?\u201d Bob glanced longingly at the card table.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Peggy said pointedly. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>Corrie had to smile. The men were finding it difficult to end the evening with the women having won the first round. They\u2019d soundly beaten her and Peggy last time, so she considered this poetic justice.</p><p>Roy and Corrie walked their guests to the front door while Linnette helped herself to a slice of cake. Whatever was troubling her must be serious if her diet-conscious daughter had resorted to cake.</p><p>After heartfelt farewells, Corrie returned to the kitchen.</p><p>Roy faked a yawn. \u201cI\u2019ll go up to bed and leave you women to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad, this involves you, too.\u201d Linnette gestured with her fork to the empty chairs across from her.</p><p>Roy pulled one of them out and stretched his long legs. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloria Ashton.\u201d</p><p>Roy turned to his wife. \u201cWho\u2019s she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLinnette\u2019s neighbor,\u201d Corrie reminded him.</p><p>\u201cAnd friend,\u201d her daughter added. \u201cA good friend, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d Roy asked, his voice impatient. He was a lot more accommodating with his clients than his children, Corrie thought, and she resisted the urge to kick him under the table.</p><p>\u201cDoes it have to do with Chad?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, the doctor fellow,\u201d Roy muttered.</p><p>Linnette lowered her head and nodded. \u201cHe asked me to have coffee with him after work a week ago, and I agreed.\u201d She frowned and then shrugged her shoulders. \u201cBasically, he wanted to tell me he\u2019s dating Gloria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour neighbor,\u201d Roy put in, although by this point, he knew darn well who Gloria was. \u201cWhy should he have to ask your permission? It\u2019s none of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is exactly what I told him.\u201d</p><p>Now Corrie was getting confused. \u201cI must\u2019ve missed something here. Last I heard, you\u2019d decided pining after Chad was a waste of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig waste,\u201d Linnette concurred. \u201cI told Chad if he wanted my permission to date Gloria, he had it. I felt that his asking me was junior-high stuff. Then Chad explained that Gloria\u2019s refused to go out with him because she and I are friends.\u201d</p><p>It sounded like the kind of thing that happened in high school, all right. \u201cWhy would she do that?\u201d Roy demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I tried to talk to her,\u201d Linnette said, \u201cbut she wouldn\u2019t listen. She said men are a dime a dozen.\u201d Their daughter sent her father a tentative glance. \u201cSorry, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cContinue,\u201d Roy urged, waving off her apology.</p><p>\u201cGloria said good friends aren\u2019t that easy to come by, and I agree. I told her it doesn\u2019t matter to me that she\u2019s interested in Chad, but she said she didn\u2019t want to risk losing my friendship over a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Chad blames you?\u201d</p><p>Linnette sighed. \u201cI feel guilty about it and yet why should I? I went so far as to tell Gloria that if she didn\u2019t go out with Chad, I would\u2014and that was the worst thing I could\u2019ve said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Chad get a say in this?\u201d Roy murmured.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Linnette said. \u201cOkay, he does, but I don\u2019t care if he asks me out or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you care if Cal did?\u201d Corrie inserted triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cCal?\u201d Roy repeated. \u201cDoes every man you date have a name that starts with the letter C?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCute, Dad, very cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question,\u201d Corrie said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted with another deep sigh.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen him since he was at the clinic?\u201d</p><p>Linnette shook her head. \u201cI doubt I will, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you need to take out those sutures?\u201d In Corrie\u2019s opinion, this was the perfect excuse.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cSomeone needs to. Either Cal will do it himself or Cliff Harding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could always go to him,\u201d Corrie suggested.</p><p>\u201cIs there a reason my presence is necessary here?\u201d Roy asked in a bored voice.</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad, there is. When I asked you about Cal, you said if I was supposed to see him again, fate would send him back into my life. That\u2019s what happened with you and Mom, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Roy agreed.</p><p>\u201cFate did bring him back, and this time I refuse to make the same mistake. I don\u2019t know what\u2019ll come of it, but I\u2019m willing to find out. He isn\u2019t a doctor with a lot of degrees, and I doubt he has a large income, but he\u2019s about all the man I can handle.\u201d</p><p>Delighted, Corrie smiled, but when she looked at Roy, she noticed that her husband wasn\u2019t quite as pleased.</p><p>Thirty-Nine</p><p>Maryellen was at her wits\u2019 end. Jon had set up a makeshift bed for her downstairs. Now, what had once been their living room had become the center of her universe\u2014and her prison. The doctor didn\u2019t even want her climbing stairs. Worse, Maryellen couldn\u2019t lift anything that weighed more than a few pounds, which meant she was unable to hold her own daughter.</p><p>Fortunately, her sister was looking after Katie during the day, and Maryellen didn\u2019t know what they\u2019d do without Kelly\u2019s help. Jon handled all the childcare plus most of the housework at night, and that was difficult enough.</p><p>Every morning he drove Katie into town and then he drove back in the afternoons to pick her up. In the meantime, Maryellen was trapped in the house, restless, bored and desperately afraid any unnecessary movement would bring on premature labor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her life assumed an unsettling routine. Jon woke by seven, came downstairs and put on coffee, then went back upstairs to dress Katie. After giving Katie her cereal, he brought Maryellen a cup of herbal tea. They tried to spend a few minutes together with Katie before he took her to Kelly\u2019s. It was early spring, so ferns and early flowers were starting to emerge, and the opportunity for interesting nature shots was at its prime. Jon was often away from the house for hours. He needed to work in order to earn the money they desperately needed.</p><p>Maryellen knew he didn\u2019t want her to worry about finances\u2014as if that could be avoided. Naturally she was concerned. Without her working, they were forced to live on a single income. Jon\u2019s sales increased every year, but he wasn\u2019t yet at the level where he could support himself, let alone a wife and two children. Maryellen had encouraged him to quit as chef for The Lighthouse restaurant and devote himself to his career. Her plan had worked well until now.</p><p>The front door opened and Maryellen set aside the novel she was reading. Her attention had been wandering all morning; the hours dragged on endlessly. Jon walked into the house carrying the backpack in which he kept his camera equipment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d</p> <p>She tried to smile.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he asked as he slipped off his boots.</p><p>\u201cCranky,\u201d she moaned. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how awful it is to stay in bed like this.\u201d Every place she looked, there was something that needed to be cleaned or finished, folded or put away. Jon tried, but he couldn\u2019t manage everything on his own.</p><p>\u201cHow about if I make lunch?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d She appreciated the offer and knew Jon was trying to please her. The fact was, she didn\u2019t have much of an appetite these days. Why would she? The most exercise she got was walking to the downstairs bathroom and Dr. DeGroot had suggested she cut back on those visits as much as possible.</p> <p>\u201cYou barely touched your breakfast,\u201d Jon reminded her. He sat on the edge of her bed, his eyes revealing tenderness and care. \u201cI\u2019ll make your favorite\u2014a toasted cheese sandwich and tomato soup.\u201d</p><p>She smiled; for his sake she\u2019d try to take a few bites.</p><p>Jon kissed her cheek and moved into the kitchen. \u201cDid anyone phone while I was out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Maryellen crossed her arms. For the first couple of weeks, she\u2019d received daily calls from Lois, needing advice or guidance. Those calls had stopped. Apparently her assistant, or one-time assistant, was comfortable as manager of the gallery now. Her mother usually tried to call during her lunch hour, and Maryellen was thankful for the distraction. But the library was often hectic around noon and her calls had dwindled down to maybe three a week.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear from your mom?\u201d Jon asked as if reading her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cNot today.\u201d Grace helped Maryellen as much as possible. Her mother, however, had a life of her own. Now that she was engaged to Cliff, Grace spent every spare minute with him. Maryellen wasn\u2019t sure when the wedding was scheduled to take place. Soon, she suspected. It was doubtful she\u2019d be able to attend, which depressed her further.</p> <p>\u201cMy vacation pay is up this week,\u201d she said as Jon came back five minutes later with a tray. She didn\u2019t want to be the bearer of bad news, but it was important her husband realize there\u2019d be no more checks. She worried constantly about the fact that they were about to take a financial freefall. Worse, they\u2019d have to pay the medical insurance premiums, which were hefty. Maryellen felt grateful to have some continuing coverage from her job, but the benefits were limited.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jon said as if it meant nothing. \u201cWe\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d She gazed at the diamond ring he\u2019d given her for Christmas. How she wished he\u2019d put that money in the bank, instead. They were on the brink of financial ruin, and here she was, sporting a huge diamond ring.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your faith, Maryellen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy faith?\u201d she repeated. \u201cIn you? In God?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn both,\u201d he stated calmly. He rested the tray of soup and sandwiches on her lap and sat next to her. \u201cI know this is hard, sweetheart, but we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen had taken over the bill-paying and she wasn\u2019t sure Jon grasped how tight things really were. How close they\u2019d already come to not meeting their obligations\u2014and now with the insurance premiums to pay...</p><p>\u201cOnly thirteen more weeks until the baby\u2019s born.\u201d</p> <p>If he meant that to be encouraging, it had the opposite effect. Thirteen weeks sounded like forever.</p><p>\u201cEat,\u201d he said, pushing the cheese sandwich toward her.</p><p>For the baby\u2019s sake, Maryellen took one small bite. Then another. Jon had to coax her every time. She didn\u2019t mean to be such a problem, and sighed, feeling wretched. Caught up in her own miseries, she hadn\u2019t noticed that Jon\u2019s mood wasn\u2019t any better than her own.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay, honey?\u201d she asked anxiously.</p><p>His face immediately relaxed as if to reassure her. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d tell me if it wasn\u2019t, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d he promised.</p><p>But Maryellen had to wonder. And the more she did, the guiltier she felt. \u201cI\u2019ve been horrible all day, haven\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d He dismissed her question with a shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cI have, and don\u2019t tell me otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Jon grinned, but Maryellen could tell it was forced.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhy? So you\u2019ll be more depressed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJon,\u201d she cried. \u201cWe\u2019re a couple\u2014a team. We shouldn\u2019t hide the way we feel from each other. Communication is the key. You\u2019re the one who told me that, remember?\u201d</p><p>She set the tray aside, unable to eat any more.</p><p>Jon looked away from her and into the distance. \u201cI went to see Seth Gunderson about working part-time. We could use the money, and I don\u2019t care what hours he gives me.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen hated the thought of Jon postponing his photography, but they were going to need a steady income.</p><p>\u201cSeth was pleased to see me. He said he\u2019d take me back anytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good news, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was\u2014until I found out the only hours available were at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Maryellen couldn\u2019t cope with Katie alone.</p><p>\u201cSeth understands I need daytime hours, and he said he\u2019d talk to the day chef and see if he\u2019d be willing to trade shifts for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be wonderful.\u201d Maryellen tried to sound positive. At the same time, she realized that if Jon worked all day he wouldn\u2019t have a chance to continue his commercial photography business. It was a lose-lose proposition.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be just fine,\u201d he said again, but the comment fell flat.</p><p>Maryellen swallowed hard. \u201cWould you hold me for just a moment?\u201d she asked. Everything seemed better when she was in her husband\u2019s arms. There she found comfort and peace. With her head against his shoulder, she could anticipate the future and remember that at the end of this enforced rest, they\u2019d have a second child. Katie would have a little brother or sister. A little more than three months from now, this would all be over. What she needed to do was keep her gaze focused on the future and not their present circumstances.</p><p>Jon\u2019s hand caressed her back, and she sighed, content for the first time that day. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d she murmured, carefully broaching the subject.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous sign.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen felt her husband\u2019s smile. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to come up with another way. We need help, Jon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m managing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she agreed, \u201cand you\u2019re doing a wonderful job. But it\u2019s only been three weeks, and you\u2019re already exhausted. Taking care of Katie and me, cleaning the house, shopping, cooking, plus trying to work and sell your photographs. You\u2019re worn out.\u201d She couldn\u2019t begin to imagine what would happen if he added a forty-hour week at The Lighthouse to his schedule.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m tired, do you?\u201d He nuzzled her neck, but it was more affectionate than provocative. Anything remotely sexual was off limits until six weeks after the birth.</p><p>Maryellen hugged him close. \u201cYou are tired. I am, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do know people who could help.\u201d</p><p>He knew immediately who she meant. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to suggest what I assume you are, then save your breath.\u201d Jon broke away from her and stood up.</p><p>\u201cJon, would you please be reasonable about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to call my parents.\u201d</p><p>That was exactly what she wanted. \u201cThey\u2019d leap at the opportunity to spend some time with us.\u201d His father and stepmother were desperate to win back his love and would do anything to help if the chance arose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking them for a damn thing,\u201d Jon said forcefully, \u201cand I absolutely forbid you to contact them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForbid?\u201d she repeated, raising her eyebrows. \u201cForbid?\u201d The temptation to retaliate in anger nearly overwhelmed her, but she maintained a calm facade. When she spoke, Maryellen chose her words carefully. \u201cI\u2019m going to ask you to rephrase that, Jon, because I have to believe you didn\u2019t mean it the way it sounded.\u201d</p><p>Her husband started pacing. \u201cForbid wasn\u2019t a good word. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He hesitated, then walked to the picture window that overlooked Puget Sound. \u201cBut knowing how I feel about them, I would hope you\u2019d take that into consideration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have.\u201d</p><p>His back was to her, his hands in his pockets. \u201cHave you been in touch with them?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen sighed. \u201cI mailed the last photos you took of Katie and included a note that said I was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Christmas.\u201d Then she remembered she\u2019d also sent a thank-you note. \u201cI...I wrote after Christmas, too\u2014a short note to thank them for the gifts.\u201d Even then she\u2019d felt guilty, as though with this small act of kindness she was somehow betraying her husband.</p><p>Jon turned to face her. \u201cAt one time I needed my parents and they failed me. I vowed I\u2019d never ask them for help again.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen knew what was coming.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m sorry, Maryellen. I\u2019d rather work twenty hours a day than ask my parents to lift a finger to help me. I simply won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>The decision was his, and nothing she could say would change his mind. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He eyed her skeptically. \u201cAre you angry with me?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, you said it earlier\u2014we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t go behind my back?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d done that once and regretted it. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jon came back and sat down next to her. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder I love you as much as I do. You and Katie are the best thing that ever happened to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Despite what he said she\u2019d done for him, Maryellen knew it was Jon\u2019s love that had redeemed her life.</p><p>Forty</p><p>Friday evening Grace arrived at Cliff\u2019s an hour later than she\u2019d planned. She felt exhausted and worried and guilty all at once. Maryellen needed her; Cliff wanted to set the date for the wedding and she was scheduled to leave for a library conference first thing Monday morning. With all these demands, she didn\u2019t feel she was much help to anyone.</p><p>Cliff walked out to the car to meet her, and Grace swore if he said one word about her being late, she\u2019d burst into tears.</p> <p>He opened the car door and instantly sensed something was wrong. \u201cBad day?\u201d</p><p>She nodded as she climbed out. \u201cI drove to Maryellen\u2019s to see what I could do for her,\u201d she said. The house was a disaster, her daughter\u2019s spirits were low, and Jon seemed about to collapse under the burden of his responsibilities. He was cooking again, too, whenever The Lighthouse needed him to cover a shift. To top everything, Katie had the flu, which meant the little girl needed constant care. She clung to Maryellen and wouldn\u2019t allow Grace to hold or comfort her. \u201cI stayed and did a couple loads of wash, and cleaned up a bit, but Cliff, they\u2019re in bad shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>He was sweet to offer. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Offhand, I can\u2019t think of anything.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cPerhaps bring them dinner one night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it done.\u201d</p> <p>Grace was seriously thinking about not going to the conference and spending the time with her daughter, instead. She\u2019d hate to cancel; the money for her to attend had come out of their tight library budget and no one else could take her place on such short notice. The thought of wasting the round-trip ticket to San Francisco, plus the conference fee, depressed her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Grace said as she slid her arm around Cliff\u2019s waist. Together they walked toward the house.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose now would be a good time to ask you to elope, would it?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t possibly know how tempting that was. \u201cMaryellen and Kelly would never forgive me.\u201d Olivia wouldn\u2019t, either, but she didn\u2019t mention her best friend. Of the three, Olivia would be the most sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cLisa would feel the same way,\u201d he admitted grudgingly. \u201cI had no idea it was so difficult to schedule a wedding. I hate this waiting. I can see us six months from now, still searching for the perfect date, working around everyone else\u2019s schedule.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should do it,\u201d she said, thinking out loud. \u201cElope, I mean.\u201d</p> <p>Cliff came to an abrupt halt and dropped his arm from around her waist. \u201cYou aren\u2019t just saying that, are you?\u201d</p><p>Grace supposed she\u2019d meant it more as a comment than a suggestion, but then realized how badly she wanted to end this craziness and\u2014just marry him. \u201cOlivia could perform the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can get the license Monday morning.\u201d</p><p>Then she remembered she was flying out on Monday. \u201cOh, no\u2014I\u2019ve got that conference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSan Francisco.\u201d</p><p>Cliff smiled. \u201cAll the better. We\u2019ll be married there.\u201d</p><p>That sounded perfectly wonderful, if not for one minor detail. \u201cCliff, I\u2019m attending a huge library conference.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go on a real honeymoon later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d He studied her as if he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cI...I was just thinking I might have to forget about the conference altogether. Maryellen and Jon need my help, and I\u2019m feeling guilty about not doing more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you cancel out at this late date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, although it\u2019s a problem. And, Cliff, I want to go. I have workshops scheduled each day, plus there\u2019s a banquet one night and I\u2019m even on a panel about literacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should go. Why don\u2019t we hire a housecleaning service to help Maryellen out? We\u2019ll arrange it for Monday. And we\u2019ll have The Lighthouse send out a few meals. Then there\u2019s no need for you to feel guilty\u2014and you and I will go to San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>Grace stared at him. \u201cYou are a miracle worker,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAw, shucks, ma\u2019am,\u201d he muttered with fake modesty.</p><p>When she laughed, he said, \u201cYou do have some free time during the conference, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. On Wednesday afternoon.\u201d She\u2019d hoped to steal away and do a little sightseeing.</p><p>\u201cSome is enough. We won\u2019t need much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you looking for an excuse to get out of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, because I\u2019m going to make it happen. Wednesday afternoon it is, March eighth. Don\u2019t you worry about a thing.\u201d</p><p>They weren\u2019t even inside the house yet, but she threw her arms around his neck and kissed him hard. \u201cWe\u2019re running away to get married!\u201d Cliff lifted her off the ground and with a shout of jubilation, whirled her around and around.</p><p>Cal came out of the barn and gave them an odd look. He stood there, apparently waiting for an explanation.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting married,\u201d Grace told him when Cliff set her feet back on the ground.</p><p>Cal grinned. \u201cI...th-th\u2014figured as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week,\u201d Cliff added.</p><p>Cal straightened his hat. \u201cYou got that m-m-mare coming from Ken-tuck-ky.\u201d</p><p>Cliff\u2019s smile slowly faded, but then he shook his head. \u201cYou can handle her. You\u2019ll have to, because I\u2019ll be in San Francisco with my bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-yes!\u201d Cal laughed and nodded. \u201cGo!\u201d he yelled, waving them off.</p><p>Cliff wrapped his arm around her waist. \u201cIf we waited for the perfect time, it could take years. I, for one, am not willing to wait a minute longer than necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we going to tell anyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd risk the wrath of the entire universe?\u201d he teased. \u201cLisa will probably hire a hit man and I know your daughters won\u2019t be thrilled with us, either. That\u2019s the risk we\u2019ll have to take. As far as I\u2019m concerned, no one needs to know we\u2019re married until we decide to tell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if we don\u2019t tell everyone we\u2019re married, I won\u2019t be able to move in with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let my family assume we\u2019re living together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I had my say, you\u2019d be living with me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d he said, opening the front door to let her into the house. The fire in the fireplace warmed the room, welcoming her, and she glanced around at the log walls, the simple, solid furniture, the old-fashioned braided rug. This would be her home....</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll announce that we\u2019re married when we return and let the chips fall where they may,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d That solved that. \u201cWe\u2019ll schedule a wedding reception at a date convenient to all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll be years from now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she amended, smiling. \u201cWe\u2019ll schedule the reception when it\u2019s convenient to most.\u201d Then, because it was impossible to contain her excitement, Grace turned into Cliff\u2019s arms and kissed him again.</p><p>\u201cWednesday can\u2019t come soon enough for me,\u201d he murmured, his voice husky against her ear.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how long the waiting period is in California?\u201d she asked. It was three days in Washington State, and she didn\u2019t want any last-minute problems if it happened to be longer in California.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cliff said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll find out. Now don\u2019t worry\u2014we\u2019re getting married, come hell or high water.\u201d</p><p>Dinner\u2014a beef stew\u2014was warming in the Crock-Pot, and Grace set the table. She felt as if she was walking on air. Every now and then, she\u2019d catch Cliff\u2019s eye and they\u2019d share a smile. Once, Grace broke into giggles of delight. She felt so lighthearted, so...happy.</p><p>Cliff disappeared into his office after dinner and returned about twenty minutes later. \u201cI went online and there\u2019s no waiting period in California.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat!\u201d All their plans were coming together.</p><p>\u201cAnd while I was at it, I booked my flight.\u201d His eyes shone. \u201cIt\u2019s the same one as yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy. You told me when your flight was leaving, so all I had to do was check the airlines for that departure time.\u201d</p><p>Cliff said he\u2019d ask Cal to drive them to the airport early Monday morning. That meant everything was settled. \u201cHave I told you lately how brilliant you are?\u201d she asked in an admiring voice.</p><p>\u201cI am, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he said, sounding smug. \u201cIf it means I can marry you next week, you\u2019d be amazed at how smart I can get.\u201d</p><p>Cliff put in a DVD; she hardly noticed what, nor did she care. They sat together in front of the television. Cliff\u2019s legs were stretched out, his boots propped on the coffee table. He\u2019d slipped his arm around her shoulders and her fingers were linked with his. In a matter of days, she would be this man\u2019s wife....</p><p>Cliff leaned down and rested his cheek against her hair. Sighing, he asked, \u201cAre you enjoying the movie?\u201d</p><p>She had a vague impression of car chases and lots of action. What she enjoyed wasn\u2019t the movie, but being with him. \u201cNot really. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need help reorganizing the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight as well, since you\u2019re moving in with me the minute we get back from San Francisco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my house?\u201d All of a sudden she realized that their decision to elope brought immediate consequences.</p><p>Cliff shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s up to you and the girls. Keep it, sell it, rent it\u2014do whatever you want as long as you promise you won\u2019t live anywhere but with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCliff, what about Buttercup and Sherlock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll adjust to a new home.\u201d He seemed so confident. \u201cHey,\u201d he muttered, \u201cyou\u2019re not having second thoughts, are you?\u201d</p><p>When he was looking at her like this, his eyes intense with love, there wasn\u2019t a thing in the world that concerned her.</p><p>\u201cNo\u2014but I don\u2019t know anything about horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you enjoy working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen keep your job.\u201d He frowned. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Grace grabbed his shirt collar and brought his mouth down to hers. Then she kissed him with everything she had. \u201cDoes that answer your question?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Forty-One</p><p>Linnette pulled onto the side of the road and looked at her MapQuest printout. According to the directions, Cliff Harding\u2019s ranch, where Cal Washburn was employed as a trainer, was right here. She wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d expected, but it wasn\u2019t this massive piece of property. The field in front was bordered by a white fence that stretched as far as the eye could see. There were a dozen horses grazing, their bodies sleek and beautiful. Linnette could tell they were valuable. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The barn was huge, with what appeared to be an apartment above it, and the house, set back at the end of the drive, was a two-story log building with plenty of windows for light.</p><p>Stopping to check the address was just an excuse, a stalling tactic. Linnette knew she\u2019d taken a big risk in coming out here to talk to Cal. A very big risk. He could slam the door in her face or tell her to get out. She didn\u2019t think that would happen, though. More likely he\u2019d be completely indifferent to her. That was, after all, what she deserved. But it didn\u2019t matter; she had to do this, had to explain.</p><p>Even now, on the verge of seeing him, she wasn\u2019t sure what she\u2019d say. She hoped inspiration would strike when she needed it, because this was probably the most difficult conversation she\u2019d ever had. She didn\u2019t want to be attracted to Cal, but she hadn\u2019t been able to get him out of her mind. She refused to accept that he didn\u2019t feel the same way about her. He couldn\u2019t kiss her like that and feel nothing.</p><p>Sitting by the side of the road wasn\u2019t going to accomplish anything, so she started the engine and entered the driveway that led to the house. Linnette had expected some sort of activity but the house looked deserted. The only vehicle in sight was a battered pickup. Just her luck to get up her courage to come all this way and find Cal wasn\u2019t home.</p> <p>Deciding to explore, she parked close to the house and, dropping her keys in her coat pocket, walked to the barn. The doors were open and, as she approached, she heard Cal talking. Apparently there was someone with him.</p><p>Linnette suddenly realized he wasn\u2019t stuttering. The hair on the back of her neck went up. Was his speech impediment some kind of stunt? If so, she was not amused.</p><p>Hands swinging at her sides, Linnette marched into the barn.</p><p>Once she\u2019d gone all the way inside, she saw that Cal was alone. He crouched beside a huge horse\u2014a stallion, judging by certain obvious signs\u2014and was examining the beast\u2019s hoof, talking all the while. His back was to Linnette, so he didn\u2019t see her.</p><p>The stallion, however, did and reared his head, alerting Cal to the fact that someone else was present.</p> <p>Cal straightened and glanced over his shoulder. When he saw her, he dropped the horse\u2019s foot. The stallion didn\u2019t take kindly to such neglectful treatment; he snorted and pawed the ground.</p><p>As if to apologize, Cal removed his glove and stroked the animal\u2019s nose.</p><p>Linnette noticed that the bandage was off, and she grimaced at the risk of infection.</p><p>Without a word, he grasped the stallion\u2019s halter and led him into a stall.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t stuttering,\u201d she said when he came out.</p><p>He stared at her. \u201cI d-d-don\u2019t with a-a-animals.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust people?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, then shrugged, suggesting he didn\u2019t understand it himself.</p><p>For a moment she\u2019d nearly forgotten the true purpose of her visit. \u201cHow\u2019s the hand?\u201d she asked in a concerned voice.</p><p>Cal looked at it as if he\u2019d forgotten, and again answered with a shrug, a quick lift of his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat about those stitches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI t-took care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can check it, if you like.\u201d The moment she said that, she knew giving him a choice was a mistake. \u201cYou\u2019ve kept it clean, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help.\u201d</p> <p>He felt strongly enough about that to be able to speak without a single hesitation.</p><p>\u201cI know, but I was in the area and thought I\u2019d stop by.\u201d He\u2019d probably see through that weak explanation, but it was the best she could do.</p><p>\u201cUn-in-n-n-vited?\u201d</p><p>Linnette gestured carelessly, as though she often stopped by people\u2019s homes unannounced, welcome or not. Refusing to give him an opportunity to argue, she stepped forward. \u201cLet me see your hand.\u201d</p><p>At first he seemed about to refuse. She peered around the dimly lit space. The inside of a barn wasn\u2019t the best place to examine a cut. \u201cIs there someplace else we could go so I could take a look at this in the light?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He nodded reluctantly, then led her to the stairs and without a word, headed up to what must be his apartment. When she reached the top, he let her inside. The apartment was surprisingly spacious and modern. However, it was badly in need of a woman\u2019s touch. The windows had no blinds or curtains; the furniture was bulky and dark. The only photographs were of horses, the only decoration a pillow at the end of the sofa.</p><p>Cal pulled out a kitchen chair for her and went to the sink. He lathered his hands with soap, drying them on a kitchen towel. Then he sat down in the chair next to hers and laid his hand on the table, palm up. He smelled of fresh hay and leather\u2014the scent she\u2019d noticed on him the night he\u2019d kissed her. It had acted like a powerful aphrodisiac then. It did now.</p><p>To disguise her attraction, Linnette examined her handiwork. The cut had healed nicely. \u201cYou took good care of it,\u201d she said, and smoothly ran her fingers over his palm. At the feel of her skin against his, Cal bristled. She chose to ignore his revulsion at her touch. \u201cI don\u2019t see any infection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-none,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>She looked up long enough to smile. Long enough to let him read the message in her eyes. The regret, the fear of rejection, the apology. He had to understand that she hadn\u2019t found it easy to come to him like this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m enjoying my work at the medical clinic,\u201d she said casually, disregarding his impatience. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a variety of cases. It\u2019s something different every day.\u201d</p><p>Cal didn\u2019t comment.</p><p>\u201cWorking with Dr. Timmons has been interesting.\u201d</p><p>Cal seemed to tense at the mention of the other man.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever done anything you regret?\u201d she asked. She didn\u2019t give him the opportunity to answer, for fear of what he\u2019d say. Perhaps he regretted having kissed her.</p><p>\u201cI met Chad at the hospital while I was training in Seattle,\u201d she said. \u201cI was attracted to him then, and I felt elated when I discovered he was going to work at the clinic, too.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t react, didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cI know now that my attraction to him was a schoolgirl crush. His interests lie elsewhere and\u2014and as a matter of fact, so do mine.\u201d She held his gaze for an extra-long moment. \u201cCal,\u201d she said, her voice dropping to a whisper. \u201cI am so sorry for the way I treated you\u2014so very sorry.\u201d</p><p>He still didn\u2019t respond, and she read the indecision in his eyes, as if he wasn\u2019t convinced he should trust her.</p><p>\u201cI knew almost immediately,\u201d she continued, bending her head. \u201cYou kissed me and I was afraid. I know that sounds idiotic, but I was. I didn\u2019t want to be attracted to you. I didn\u2019t want to feel the things I did when you touched me.\u201d She exhaled and hoped he sensed how much it had cost her to be this honest. \u201cI even went to my dad and talked to him about you. He said I should let it rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-he\u2019s a w-w-wise man.\u201d</p><p>Linnette pretended not to hear him. \u201cDad said I should wait to see if you came back into my life. A couple of weeks after that, you were in the clinic with this cut.\u201d She didn\u2019t add how absolutely delighted she was to see him, despite his injury. That injury had been the working of fate, the fate her father had alluded to.</p><p>\u201cTimmons?\u201d he asked, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what he wanted to know. \u201cOh, you\u2019re asking about Chad and me?\u201d</p><p>Cal nodded.</p><p>\u201cChad did ask me to have coffee with him that one time\u2014the day you were in the clinic.\u201d She emphasized that this had happened only once. \u201cHe\u2019s dating a friend of mine now. Well, actually, that\u2019s a problem, too. Gloria\u2019s apparently told him she\u2019s not interested, but I know she is.\u201d Linnette sighed. \u201cSometimes relationships get rather convoluted.\u201d</p><p>He snorted softly.</p><p>Having said everything she could think of, she met his eyes and smiled boldly. \u201cNow that I\u2019ve explained, what are you doing tonight?\u201d She felt a bit like Indiana Jones stepping into thin air.</p><p>\u201cW-working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Friday night, then?\u201d She was working late, which meant they wouldn\u2019t have dinner until most people were in bed, but she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cC-can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She was beginning to get the message. \u201cI see.\u201d That was pretty much what she\u2019d expected. Linnette had given this her best shot and it hadn\u2019t worked. She stood up, prepared to leave. But then...Linnette didn\u2019t have a single excuse for her brazen behavior. Cal had more or less told her to go; he couldn\u2019t have made it plainer. He wasn\u2019t interested in seeing her again. So what did she do? What could she do?</p><p>She kissed him.</p><p>Judging by his reaction, Cal was as shocked as she was. At first he kept his mouth tightly closed and seemed about to push her away. But he didn\u2019t. Instead he moaned in welcome and parted his lips as he settled his arms around her waist and brought her onto his lap. Then he gave himself over to the kiss. His hands were in her hair and a moment later they were sliding beneath her sweater. Linnette moaned between kisses at the way her nipples instantly tightened at his touch. He continued kissing her as he found the clasp to her bra and unfastened it, groaning as his hands cupped her breasts.</p><p>Breathing hard, Linnette broke off the kiss and raised her head. Her mind took a few seconds to clear. When it did, she saw Cal watching her. His eyes were warm with desire\u2014no doubt a reflection of the desire in her own.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSh-h,\u201d he whispered back. He was still caressing her breasts. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. I knew you would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, too.\u201d</p><p>Cal grinned and kissed the side of her jaw. \u201cYou can apologize anytime you want.\u201d His words were gentle and coaxing and fell sweetly on her ears.</p><p>\u201cIt would be very easy to let you take me to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be easy for me, too.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t ready to make this commitment. Her body was, though, and she felt a little alarmed at how quickly he could lower her inhibitions.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and nodded. \u201cWe know one thing,\u201d he said after a while. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly compatible in some areas.\u201d</p><p>Linnette smiled to herself as he refastened her bra and tugged down her sweater. That was when she realized that Cal didn\u2019t stutter when he talked to horses\u2014or when he made love to a woman.</p><p>Forty-Two</p><p>Cecilia looked up from the computer screen, blinked and then reread Ian\u2019s e-mail. According to her husband, the USS George Washington was coming back to Bremerton shipyard a full two months ahead of schedule. This was too good to be true!</p><p>All at once Cecilia couldn\u2019t sit still. In her joy and excitement she hurried to the phone and dialed Cathy\u2019s number. The line was busy but a computer voice informed her that for a mere seventy-five cents, it would ring through when her friend was off the line. Cecilia didn\u2019t have the patience to wait nor was she willing to squander a single penny.</p><p>She paced and tried again five minutes later. The line was still busy. Because she needed to talk to someone and soon, she dialed Rachel Pendergast\u2019s home number. It rang twice and then Rachel answered. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, hi, Cecilia,\u201d she said. She sounded pleased to hear from her. \u201cHave you had the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re due soon, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>The answer to that was pregnant. Very pregnant. But what she said was, \u201cI feel great, better than great. I\u2019m feeling fabulous. Do you know why? Ian\u2019s coming home!\u201d</p><p>This news was greeted by a short silence. \u201cJust Ian? I mean, he isn\u2019t arriving by himself, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe entire aircraft carrier is on its way back to base.\u201d Ian hadn\u2019t told her why, Cecilia explained, but he probably couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cIn other words, Nate will be back, too.\u201d Rachel had kept in touch with Cecilia, Carol and Cathy, even though she\u2019d broken off her relationship with Nate Olsen.</p> <p>\u201cI thought I should give you a heads-up,\u201d Cecilia said. She suspected from everything Ian had told her that Nate wasn\u2019t going to drop this relationship without a fight.</p><p>Rachel sighed. \u201cThanks for letting me know, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a problem. I doubt I\u2019ll be seeing Nate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe might change your mind.\u201d Cecilia hoped he did. She liked Rachel, and she\u2019d only heard about Nate through her husband, but Ian spoke highly of the warrant officer. It was a shame that Rachel had let her insecurities come between them.</p><p>\u201cNate\u2019s a wonderful man, but I\u2019m not the right woman for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t he be the one to decide that?\u201d Cecilia asked and then sighed. \u201cSorry, that\u2019s none of my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is really good news for you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Rachel said, ignoring Cecilia\u2019s comment. \u201cThis means Ian might be home when your baby\u2019s born.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, if he hurries.\u201d She didn\u2019t know the exact day and time the George Washington was scheduled to dock.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re feeling all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d True, she was extra-tired at night and tended to go to bed earlier than she did when Ian was home. The baby was constantly active, kicking and stretching. She rubbed her hand over her belly, communicating her love to her son.</p><p>\u201cKeep me informed,\u201d Rachel said.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>They said their farewells and as soon as they\u2019d ended the call, Cecilia dialed Cathy\u2019s number again. This time the phone rang, and Cathy picked up on the first ring.</p><p>\u201cCathy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCecilia!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you hear?\u201d they cried simultaneously and then burst into peals of laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d Cathy said.</p><p>\u201cI got an e-mail from Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAndrew sent me one, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have the strongest feeling Ian will be with me when Aaron\u2019s born,\u201d Cecilia said happily.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re keeping the name?\u201d This had been a silent battle of wills between Cecilia and her husband. He hadn\u2019t agreed to the A-name. At the same time\u2014once he\u2019d retracted his original objections\u2014he hadn\u2019t disagreed, either.</p><p>\u201cAfter all these weeks, the name\u2019s comfortable to me.\u201d The last thing Cecilia wanted was to argue with Ian over a name when he finally got home. Suddenly another thought struck her.</p><p>\u201cCathy,\u201d she cried. \u201cOh, my goodness, Ian\u2019s never seen me pregnant before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true,\u201d her friend insisted. \u201cAnd if you recall, he\u2019s the one who got you in this condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but really pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnant is pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia smiled at Cathy\u2019s teasing. \u201cYou know what I mean. He\u2019s never seen me this big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to love it, seeing your belly swollen with his baby. Andrew was so loving with me before I delivered Andy. He hardly let me go to the bathroom by myself.\u201d</p><p>Cathy had miscarried two babies before Andy. None of the doctors had been able to tell her what had gone wrong with those first pregnancies and she\u2019d lived in fear that she\u2019d miscarry the third one, too. But she\u2019d successfully carried Andy to term.</p><p>\u201cEverything will be different this time,\u201d Cathy said confidently, answering Cecilia\u2019s unasked question. \u201cJust you wait and see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy due date\u2019s only a few days away. I couldn\u2019t bear it if Ian was so close and couldn\u2019t be with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he can\u2019t, you know I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia whispered her thanks, more grateful than ever for Cathy\u2019s friendship. \u201cHold tight, Aaron, hold tight,\u201d she told her unborn baby after she\u2019d hung up the phone.</p><p>Three hours later, as Cecilia got ready for bed, her back began to ache. Rubbing it as she walked into her bedroom, she had a feeling that her son had decided he wasn\u2019t going to wait for his daddy.</p><p>By midnight, there was no doubt she was in labor. Logging onto the computer, she sent her husband an e-mail to let him know. She timed the contractions, pacing through the apartment as she did. When they were five minutes apart, Cecilia phoned Cathy.</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d Cathy screamed, so excited she woke Andy. \u201cI\u2019ll be right over. Don\u2019t move, breathe deeply and don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d Without a pause, phone pressed to her ear, she shouted instructions to her son to get his suitcase and his teddy bear. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in twenty minutes,\u201d she promised Cecilia.</p><p>Sure enough, Cathy rolled up in front of the duplex precisely twenty-two minutes later, after dropping off her son at Carol\u2019s place. She had a basket of soothing musical CDs, lotions and fruit chews. There were snacks, too, in case Cathy got hungry during the labor.</p><p>Shortly after her arrival at the hospital, Cecilia was prepped and brought to the labor room. Cathy was with her, wielding a stopwatch and clutching the CD player. Roy Orbison crooned softly from the side of Cecilia\u2019s bed.</p><p>She raised her head and laughed. \u201cSomehow, I don\u2019t think this is a good time to hear \u2018Pretty Woman,\u2019\u201d she joked.</p><p>\u201cI disagree. If Ian was here he\u2019d say you\u2019re beautiful, and he\u2019d be right. You are, Cecilia, and you\u2019re about to have your baby.\u201d Cathy squealed with delight and Cecilia smiled.</p><p>But she stopped smiling as the pain overcame her. She lay back on the pillow and closed her eyes, trying hard to let her body flow with the contraction instead of fighting it. Cathy started counting off the seconds in a slow, even tone.</p><p>With Allison, Cecilia had labored for nearly fifteen hours in a room by herself, with only a nurse to check on her from time to time. When Allison was born, her cry had been weak and barely audible.</p><p>By contrast, Aaron Jacob Randall made his appearance ten hours after Cecilia had entered the hospital. He gave a loud, lusty squall as he was born, pink and perfect. He didn\u2019t like the bright lights and made sure everyone in the room heard about it. Nor did he appreciate having a suction tube stuck up his nose.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s certainly got a good set of lungs,\u201d Cathy said, squeezing Cecilia\u2019s hand. Tears streamed down her face and Cecilia\u2019s, too\u2014tears of joy. She strained to see her son.</p><p>\u201cWhat about his heart?\u201d she pleaded. \u201cIs his heart okay?\u201d</p><p>The attending physician smiled over at her. \u201cHe looks just fine, but we\u2019ll run all the tests and let you know right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, exhausted.</p><p>\u201cYou did so well,\u201d Cathy said, brushing the wet tendrils from Cecilia\u2019s forehead. \u201cYou were incredible\u2014no epidural or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep,\u201d Cathy urged. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of letting everyone at your office know. Plus Carol and Rachel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Sleeping certainly won\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Already her eyes were drifting shut. After a few minutes, Cecilia was hardly aware of the activity going on around her. She knew Aaron had been placed in a tiny bed in her room and was sleeping at her side, swaddled in a pale blue blanket with a blue knit cap on his head.</p><p>Cecilia wasn\u2019t sure what time it was when she woke. Her first thought was that she\u2019d given birth to her son. She\u2019d so badly wanted Ian with her, but that hadn\u2019t been possible. Slowly she opened her eyes and discovered that her son\u2019s tiny crib was empty. Half-raising herself, braced on one elbow, she saw her husband sitting beside the bed, cradling Aaron in his arms.</p><p>Cecilia blinked, afraid her imagination and desire had conjured him up. \u201cIan?\u201d she tried tentatively.</p><p>He glanced at her and Cecilia saw that his eyes were bright with tears.</p><p>\u201cIt is you. Oh, Ian, Ian, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here. How...when?\u201d Her tongue kept tripping over itself in her happiness.</p><p>Her husband gave her the brightest smile she\u2019d ever seen. \u201cThe George Washington had a transport that was headed home. The chaplain talked to my CO after I learned you\u2019d gone into labor. I don\u2019t know what he said or did, but he got me on that transport.\u201d</p><p>One day Cecilia would personally thank him.</p><p>\u201cSo this is our son,\u201d Ian said, gazing at Aaron. The baby wrapped his tiny hand around Ian\u2019s finger and held on. \u201cHe\u2019s perfect,\u201d Ian whispered, nearly overcome with emotion. \u201cI talked to the pediatrician and she put Aaron through a test they do on newborns\u2014the Apgar, it\u2019s called\u2014and he scored a ten.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia sighed, relieved and grateful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding our baby,\u201d her husband said in awe. \u201cOur Aaron.\u201d</p><p>Ian had never gotten the opportunity to hold Allison. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I didn\u2019t make it for the labor,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>Ian\u2019s head came up. \u201cNext time?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cAaron needs a little sister, but we\u2019ll talk about that later.\u201d</p><p>Her husband grinned. \u201cAye, aye, Captain. At your service.\u201d</p><p>Forty-Three</p><p>It was Saturday afternoon. Allison Cox walked out of the JCPenney store in the Silverdale Mall with two of her best friends, Kaci and Alicia. The St. Patrick\u2019s Day displays were still up and the entire mall was decorated with an Irish theme. She was joking and laughing with her friends, having a good time, when she heard her name.</p><p>\u201cHey, Allison.\u201d</p><p>She stopped abruptly when she saw Anson, shocked that he\u2019d spoken to her. He wore the same long black coat, noticeably shabbier now. His hair was messy and his boots untied. He didn\u2019t look good. And normally he worked on Saturdays. Why was he here?</p><p>Without a word to her friends, Allison joined him. She knew something was terribly wrong even before he spoke.</p><p>\u201cDitch your friends,\u201d he said, eyeing Kaci and Alicia, who were a few paces behind her.</p><p>She sucked in a breath. \u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He turned and walked away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Kaci said, hugging Allison briefly. \u201cGo. Meet us at Waldenbooks at three.\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded gratefully and hurried after Anson. He was walking through the mall at such speed that she had to run in order to catch up with him.</p><p>\u201cAnson, stop!\u201d she called. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned around but didn\u2019t smile when he saw her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked. Clearly something had, otherwise he would never have spoken to her. He\u2019d kept his word to her father. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see you. Eddie told me you\u2019d gone to the mall. I took the bus.\u201d He looked past her, his eyes hard as flint. \u201cI lost my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Lighthouse laid you off?\u201d That didn\u2019t make sense. Her father had checked on how he was doing, and Seth Gunderson had said Anson was conscientious and diligent in his work habits. There was even talk of promoting him from dishwasher to working as a prep cook. Her father seemed pleased that his faith in Anson had been well placed.</p> <p>\u201cDoes this have anything to do with Tony?\u201d</p><p>Anson frowned. \u201cWho told you about him and me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad. Mr. Gunderson mentioned that the two of you weren\u2019t getting along. Is he involved in...in getting you fired?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they give you a reason?\u201d she said, her hand on his sleeve. Anson was so cold and angry and with his whole Goth regalia, including the heavy pewter cross he wore around his neck, people obviously found him menacing. Shoppers gave them a wide berth as they stood outside the food court.</p> <p>Anson refused to meet her gaze. \u201cThey said it was reduction in force.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe business slacked off,\u201d she said, thinking quickly. \u201cThat happens, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was an excuse.\u201d His eyes narrowed as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cDo you think there was another reason?\u201d she asked softly, her hand still on his arm.</p><p>For the first time he looked directly at her. But this boy wasn\u2019t the Anson she knew. He was irate and resentful, and she felt as though every bit of his fury was directed at her. Allison nearly dropped her hand and stepped back.</p><p>\u201cMr. Gunderson thinks I took something that didn\u2019t belong to me. He thinks I took cash out of his office.\u201d</p> <p>Allison had the sudden urge to sit down. She walked over to an empty table and pulled out a chair. Anson followed.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do that.\u201d She refused to believe Anson was guilty of such a thing.</p><p>Pain flashed from his eyes but was immediately shielded. \u201cThat\u2019s not what Seth Gunderson believes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe talked to you?\u201d</p><p>Anson nodded. \u201cHe talked to everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he have any proof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could he?\u201d Anson asked hotly. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Allison reached for his hand, curling her fingers around his. She needed to touch him, to reassure him. At first he resisted and tried to pull away. Then he entwined their fingers, holding onto her as if she were the only solid thing in a world that was crumbling. Allison didn\u2019t know what to say that could make this better.</p> <p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d she asked after a while.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said and swore. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t go back there if they begged me to. I worked my butt off for that restaurant and then they treat me like\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t finish. He didn\u2019t need to; Allison knew what he intended to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to my dad,\u201d she suggested. Her father had been willing to help Anson before. Once she explained the situation, he would again. She hoped.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His voice was harsh. \u201cNot this time.\u201d He laughed. \u201cYour father can\u2019t do a damn thing for me. I was the obvious suspect, you know. Mr. Gunderson knows I was responsible for setting the park shed on fire. If they were going to accuse anyone, it would be me\u2014and why not? I\u2019ve been in trouble. I was a convenient scapegoat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything is right, Allison. You live in this comfortable world where everything turns out perfectly. It isn\u2019t like that for everyone. You\u2019ve got parents who care about you. You\u2019ve got a home and a future. Some of us don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a future. We all do.\u201d Her fingers tightened around his. \u201cWe each make our own.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met hers as he digested her words. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the options you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know who did it\u2014stole the money, I mean?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. \u201cNo, but I have my suspicions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Tony?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony said I made everyone look bad because I worked hard and put in extra time. He was hired before me and then Mr. Gunderson talked to the chef about training me to be a prep cook. Tony didn\u2019t think that was fair.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d report this to her father and have him talk to Mr. Gunderson. \u201cMy dad and Mr. Gunderson are friends.\u201d</p><p>Anson shook his head. \u201cNo. I\u2019ll take care of this in my own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d she asked, afraid of what he might do in this state of mind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>He had a wild, disheveled look and she suspected he hadn\u2019t slept in a long time. \u201cHave you been home?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cMom\u2019s brought home a new friend.\u201d His lips curled in a half snarl. \u201cWe don\u2019t get along. To put it mildly.\u201d</p><p>Anson didn\u2019t need to spell it out for her; his home life was dreadful. Allison frowned. His problems seemed huge, overwhelming. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Like I said, some of us were dealt a lousy hand.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to take away his burdens. She knew that was impossible, and the ache in her heart increased.</p><p>Allison glanced at her watch. Kaci had to be to work by four and Allison didn\u2019t want to make her late.</p><p>Anson stood abruptly and checked his watch, too. \u201cI gotta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, his gaze focused elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cWhen will I see you again?\u201d</p><p>That, too, was answered with a shrug, as if he didn\u2019t know. As if it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Allison tried to brush aside her disappointment. \u201cI need to know,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI care more than you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said starkly. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d she told him. \u201cJust promise me you won\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Anything. Please, Anson, this is too important. Everything will work out in the end. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>He snickered as though he found her attitude amusing. \u201cThings like this don\u2019t work out for people like me. It\u2019s time you learned that.\u201d</p><p>He walked away without looking at her again.</p><p>She had a sick feeling in her stomach. But as much as she wanted to run after Anson, she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>That evening, Allison could barely eat dinner. As soon as the meal was over, she escaped inside her room. Twice now, Anson had come to her bedroom window and she hoped he would again. They needed to talk.</p><p>Sitting on her bed, writing in her journal, Allison poured out everything that was in her heart. She was terrified for Anson and angry about what had happened. She wanted to help him. If she spoke to her father, he might be angry that they\u2019d broken their word. And Anson didn\u2019t want him to find out he\u2019d been fired....</p><p>At nine her mother tapped on her door.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d Allison said. She thrust her journal under a pillow and sat cross-legged.</p><p>Rosie Cox walked into the room and sat on the end of the bed. She touched Allison\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve been very quiet this evening. Is something bothering you?\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded and stared down at her pale-pink comforter. \u201cIt\u2019s Anson,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAre you sad because you two can\u2019t see each other yet?\u201d</p><p>She nodded rather than confess that she\u2019d seen him and, more than that, spoken to him. All at once Anson\u2019s burden became too much for her and silent tears began to course down her face.</p><p>Her mother held her close, murmuring soothing words, and Allison remembered that Anson had said some kids were dealt a better hand in life than others. He was right; she had been. Until she\u2019d gotten to know Anson, she hadn\u2019t realized how lucky she was to have two parents who loved her.</p><p>Her mother gently stroked her hair. \u201cIs there something you want to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be upset with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll risk that,\u201d her mother whispered softly.</p><p>\u201cAnson and I talked.\u201d She waited a moment, fearing a reaction. Her mother didn\u2019t comment, so Allison continued. \u201cHe got laid off from his job. Mr. Gunderson thinks Anson took some money, but he didn\u2019t! He wouldn\u2019t. He tried so hard to do everything right, and now he\u2019s been treated unfairly. He\u2019s so hurt and angry.\u201d She swallowed hard. \u201cI\u2019m afraid of what he\u2019s going to do.\u201d</p><p>Her mother didn\u2019t say anything for a long time. \u201cDo you want your father to talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I suggested talking to Dad, but Anson wouldn\u2019t hear of it. I tried to tell him everything\u2019ll work out.\u201d She lifted her head and looked at her mother. \u201cHe laughed at me. He said that wouldn\u2019t happen for him. He won\u2019t ask Dad for help because he doesn\u2019t want Dad to be disappointed in him. Mom, he didn\u2019t do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d her mother whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to help him.\u201d</p><p>Her mother sighed. \u201cUnfortunately I don\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to do something. You can ground me, take away my computer privileges, not let me drive, do anything you want. I don\u2019t care how you punish me\u2014I\u2019m talking to Anson.\u201d Allison was willing to make any sacrifice. \u201cHe needs me, and he needs you and Dad, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. I...I love him. Go ahead and laugh if you want, but I mean it with every fiber of my being.\u201d</p><p>Her mother sighed. She didn\u2019t say Allison was being melodramatic, as she often did. Instead, she drew Allison close. \u201cI know you have feelings for this young man. I\u2019ll talk to your father and see if there\u2019s anything we can do.\u201d</p><p>Allison felt hope suddenly rise in her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not making any promises,\u201d her mother added.</p><p>Allison understood. But now, at least, Anson had someone who\u2019d stand up for him.</p><p>Forty-Four</p><p>Olivia, who\u2019d finished court for the day, sat at her desk, finishing up some paperwork. She squinted at the computer screen and decided it was time to update the prescription for her reading glasses.</p><p>Jack phoned to tell her he was home from the office; he was working eight-hour days, with no overtime. He\u2019d promised to make dinner, which should be interesting. He almost always got to the house before her these days and had taken an unexpected interest in cooking. He favored salads with lots of fresh vegetables and an occasional surprise such as dried cranberries or chopped pecans.</p><p>Grace and Cliff were married now and Olivia was delighted for her dearest friend. They\u2019d snuck away without even hinting that they intended to elope. When she\u2019d first heard the news, Olivia had been disappointed. Had she known, she would have found a way to join Grace in San Francisco. But given time, Olivia saw the wisdom of Grace and Cliff\u2019s decision. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her friend had moved in with Cliff, bringing Buttercup and Sherlock, who seemed to be adjusting nicely to their new quarters.</p><p>As she began to read her next brief, a knock sounded at her office door. It was Deputy Mike Lusk. \u201cThere\u2019s a man asking to see you, name of David Rhodes. Says he\u2019s your stepbrother. Should I bring him over?\u201d</p><p>Olivia hesitated briefly, then said, \u201cPlease. Show him in.\u201d</p><p>The deputy nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll wait outside until you\u2019re through.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>Soon, an attractive man, probably in his midforties, was escorted into her chambers. He smiled widely when he saw her. \u201cJudge Olivia Griffin?\u201d he asked, extending his hand.</p><p>She nodded and they exchanged brisk handshakes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m David Rhodes, Ben\u2019s son. It appears we\u2019re related!\u201d</p><p>Olivia remembered hearing some story about David; however, whatever it was didn\u2019t immediately come to mind. She did recall that her mother and Ben had joined him in Seattle for dinner. Her mother had raved about the restaurant and the wonderful meal they\u2019d had. Olivia also had a vague memory of something Justine had said; apparently she\u2019d met him, too.</p> <p>\u201cI was hoping for a few minutes of your time, if that would be possible.\u201d He didn\u2019t wait for a response but walked into her office and immediately sat down in the guest chair.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, her tone a little ironic. \u201cMake yourself comfortable.\u201d She glanced at her watch. \u201cI told my husband I\u2019d be home by five-forty-five, so we can talk for ten or fifteen minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d He leaned back, crossing his legs, and surveyed the room. The cut of his suit told Olivia it was expensive, possibly cashmere. The polished loafers, the silk tie\u2014this was a man who liked to spend money.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d she asked, getting directly to the point.</p><p>\u201cAh, a woman who prefers to skip the small talk.\u201d He smiled approvingly. \u201cI like a no-nonsense attitude.\u201d</p><p>His charm left her cold, although she could see why some people were swayed by it. David Rhodes was probably an experienced manipulator who relied on good looks and superficial wiles. \u201cAs I explained, I have an appointment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it\u2019s with your husband.\u201d</p><p>He sounded as if he thought she didn\u2019t need to worry, since it was only Jack. Olivia was almost sure she didn\u2019t like Ben\u2019s son and tried to remember what she\u2019d heard. With Jack\u2019s heart attack, she\u2019d missed a lot of details during the last two months.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been to Cedar Cove twice now,\u201d David said conversationally. \u201cThis is a tight community, isn\u2019t it? People know people, neighbors talk to neighbors. It\u2019s that sort of town.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think of ourselves as the kind of place anyone would like to call home.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cA good PR line,\u201d he said, but before she could respond to his cynicism, he forged ahead. \u201cI imagine you know the other judges fairly well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d she said hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cThe police, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re proud of our low crime rate.\u201d Cedar Cove had its share of crime; no community was immune. But Olivia liked to think she didn\u2019t need to lock her door when she left for the day. As a matter of habit she did, but often wondered if it was necessary.</p> <p>David clasped his hands loosely together. \u201cI can understand why Dad enjoys life in Cedar Cove as much as he does. We had no connections to this town when he moved here, so my brother and I were both surprised. We assumed he\u2019d want to live in Seattle, but Cedar Cove seems to have all the benefits of the big city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re only a ferry ride away.\u201d It was the best of both worlds, in Olivia\u2019s opinion. She enjoyed small-town life and yet she could take advantage of the cultural opportunities Seattle provided.</p><p>\u201cDad has certainly fallen for Cedar Cove\u2014and your mother,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cWe love your father. He\u2019s given my mother a new lease on life,\u201d Olivia murmured.</p><p>David gestured toward her. \u201cThat brings up another matter,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cMy father married your mother, which makes the two of us stepbrother and sister, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess it does.\u201d Olivia wished he\u2019d get to the point. She\u2019d worked with enough attorneys to recognize that this wasn\u2019t a social visit. David Rhodes wanted something.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had a sister before,\u201d he said, and there was a quality of wonderment in his voice that got on her nerves. This guy should be in community theater.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll meet Steve later on,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I will.\u201d She glanced at her watch again, hoping he\u2019d take the hint.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking we should all get together for Easter,\u201d David suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to arrange a full family gathering this year,\u201d he added quickly. \u201cBut maybe next year. We could invite both sides, get to know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep it in mind.\u201d Olivia was fast losing her patience. \u201cIs there something I can do for you?\u201d she asked pointedly.</p><p>David took an audible breath. \u201cAs it happens, there is,\u201d he said in a confidential tone. \u201cI was in town a few weeks back and due to a misunderstanding\u2014well, it\u2019s not important to discuss the details.\u201d He shook his head, implying that he found all of this distressing. \u201cI ended up leaving in a rush, and I\u2019m afraid I was driving above the speed limit.\u201d He laughed, as though embarrassed to trouble her. \u201cI was pulled over by a police officer. Unfortunately I must\u2019ve given him the wrong impression.\u201d</p><p>That meant his problem was more than a speeding offense. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Olivia asked.</p><p>\u201cThe officer\u2014now, I\u2019m sure he was only doing what he thought was his duty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe gave you a ticket.\u201d She\u2019d leave him to fill in the blank. At least now she knew what this was about. David Rhodes wanted her to fix the mess he\u2019d gotten himself into.</p><p>\u201cActually, this must\u2019ve been one of your junior officers,\u201d David said. \u201cHe was a little too eager to get his quota, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have ticket quotas in Cedar Cove.\u201d She didn\u2019t work in traffic court, but she knew the system.</p><p>\u201cThe officer apparently took a dislike to me, I\u2019m sorry to say. I didn\u2019t help matters, I suppose,\u201d David admitted with a look of chagrin. \u201cI thought he had a bad attitude. Anyhow, one thing led to another\u2014and now it\u2019s a bit of a disaster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the ticket for?\u201d Olivia asked, tired of having to ferret out each kernel of information.</p><p>\u201cSpeeding\u2014but I wasn\u2019t speeding,\u201d David insisted. \u201cI have a signed statement here from a mechanic that states my speedometer was faulty.\u201d He extracted a folded sheet of paper from inside his jacket and held it out.</p><p>\u201cDavid,\u201d she warned, \u201cput that away. I don\u2019t want to see it. Just tell me what else you were charged with.\u201d</p><p>He heaved a sigh. \u201cNegligent driving,\u201d he confessed. \u201cIt was a simple misunderstanding that got out of hand. I can\u2019t even begin to tell you what this\u2019ll do to my car insurance rates. Normally I\u2019d just pay for the ticket and be done with it. But it\u2019s going to be more difficult than that. My insurance company is threatening to cancel my policy and then I\u2019ll have to find another one, and my rates will skyrocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t paid the ticket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You see, I\u2019m experiencing a bit of a cash flow problem at the moment. I figured it\u2019d be fifty bucks or so and if it was, I\u2019d pay it and write off the entire matter. Unfortunately, the fine is more than three hundred dollars\u2014and then there\u2019s this dilemma with my insurance company. I need this whole thing to go away. The best way to make that happen is to throw myself on the mercy of the court.\u201d He laughed lightly. \u201cThen I learned that my very own sister is an influential member of the Kitsap County Court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Boy, did she.</p><p>David shook his head, as though embarrassed to trouble her with anything this trivial. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d help me out. A brief conversation with the Traffic Court judges...\u201d</p><p>Olivia relaxed in her chair and crossed her arms. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said you were friendly with the other judges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014on a social basis. It doesn\u2019t mean I can or will involve myself in any situation that would contravene the law. My relationship with my fellow judges can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it can,\u201d he argued. \u201cYou talk to them, and my little issue with the Cedar Cove police will go away.\u201d He leaned close and lowered his voice to a whisper. \u201cAll you have to do is snap your fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I can\u2019t do it.\u201d She spoke slowly, deliberately. Olivia couldn\u2019t make her position any plainer than that.</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cIn other words, you won\u2019t help me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no other words about it. I don\u2019t know how the judicial system works wherever you live, but we don\u2019t fix traffic tickets here in Cedar Cove. If you broke the law, I suggest you step forward and deal with the consequences of your actions.\u201d</p><p>Olivia found her stepbrother to be a decidedly unpleasant man, despite his glib and rather overstated charm. Then it clicked. \u201cJust a minute here,\u201d she said, bolting to her feet. \u201cYou\u2019re the one my daughter was telling me about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, hey,\u201d he said, raising both hands. \u201cI haven\u2019t dated any women in this town\u2014and definitely not your daughter. Who is she, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJustine Gunderson. You were at her restaurant.\u201d</p><p>His smile faded. \u201cYour daughter owns The Lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter and son-in-law.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s eyes went hard with a look that set Olivia\u2019s heart pounding. \u201cYour daughter took that check right out of my hand,\u201d he said from between gritted teeth. \u201cShe interfered in something that was none of her damned business.\u201d</p><p>She suddenly remembered exactly what she\u2019d heard about David Rhodes. She rose from her chair. \u201cYou were trying to cheat my mother out of five thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>David leapt to his feet. \u201cIt was a loan,\u201d he insisted, his eyes on fire. \u201cI fully intended to pay her back in two or three weeks. She\u2019s a lovely woman, kindhearted and generous. Apparently none of those traits were handed down to anyone else in the family.\u201d</p><p>Olivia wasn\u2019t going to allow him to insult her in her own office. \u201cI think it\u2019s time you left, Mr. Rhodes.\u201d She walked around her desk and opened the door. \u201cOfficer Lusk,\u201d she called.</p><p>Mike Lusk walked purposefully in her direction. \u201cWould you kindly escort Mr. Rhodes out of this building?\u201d</p><p>Mike stepped forward and planted his hands on his wide belt. \u201cThis way, Mr. Rhodes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell of a way to start off our relationship,\u201d David snarled as he moved past her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI sincerely hope, Mr. Rhodes, that we never have a relationship. Now kindly leave me and my family alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to regret this.\u201d</p><p>Olivia smiled. \u201cYou know what? I doubt it. Oh, a word of warning\u2014if you show up in my office or my courtroom again, I\u2019m going to throw the book at you.\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s eyes widened and Olivia realized she\u2019d probably divulged too much. \u201cThank you, Officer Lusk,\u201d she said formally.</p> <p>Olivia shut down her computer and reached for her coat and purse. Once she got home\u2014late\u2014she\u2019d tell Jack everything that had happened.</p><p>Forty-Five</p><p>Roy hadn\u2019t shared his suspicions with Corrie. He needed to deal with this in his own way. After all, the postcards had been addressed to him and him alone; only with the fruit basket had the messages started coming to Corrie, as well. But all communication had ceased after Valentine\u2019s Day. There\u2019d been nothing in any form for weeks now.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter; he knew. Furthermore, she knew that he knew, which was, he suspected, why he hadn\u2019t received any further postcards or anything else.</p><p>He\u2019d discovered she had been adopted and raised in California. Then he\u2019d run into a dead end. But her recent actions in the Puget Sound area had given her away. His first break had come when he\u2019d finally talked to the florist who\u2019d taken her order; from then on, things began to fall into place.</p> <p>\u201cRoy?\u201d Corrie interrupted his thoughts Saturday morning as he sat at the breakfast table. \u201cYou\u2019re very quiet.\u201d</p><p>Roy set aside the morning newspaper and reached for his coffee as Corrie slid a plate of scrambled eggs in front of him. \u201cI was reading the paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsidering how long we\u2019ve been married, do you seriously believe I don\u2019t know when something\u2019s bothering you?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. She could always tell.</p><p>Corrie sat across from him, placing her elbows on the table. \u201cHow long have you known?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA while,\u201d he returned casually.</p> <p>\u201cThen what are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I hate to admit this, but I\u2019m a little nervous. It\u2019s me she\u2019s angry with, you know.\u201d He was sure of this. And much as he wanted to take responsibility, wanted a relationship with his unknown daughter, he had trouble accepting the changes that would come into his life. Linnette and Mack would need to be told and that worried him. He hated the fact that his children might think poorly of him or their mother.</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is guilt,\u201d Corrie whispered, her voice shaky. \u201cI feel it, too, although intellectually I know I shouldn\u2019t. Giving this child up to a loving family was the very best choice I could\u2019ve made. I loved her, but at the same time, I knew I wasn\u2019t capable of caring for her on my own.\u201d</p><p>What bothered Roy wasn\u2019t simply guilt about the adoption. It was his own failures. \u201cCorrie\u2014\u201d</p><p>She cut him off. \u201cI\u2019m the one who made the decision, the one who signed the adoption papers. I don\u2019t know why she singled you out. She has no reason to be upset with you.\u201d</p><p>Roy made a pretense of eating, acting as though this was a normal morning conversation. \u201cBefore we seek her out, we have to discuss it with Linnette and Mack.\u201d</p><p>Corrie scooped up a forkful of egg, but didn\u2019t take a bite. She lowered her head. \u201cI agree.\u201d Then she glanced up and smiled. \u201cI called Mack last week.\u201d She raised her head to look at the kitchen clock. \u201cHe should be here in an hour.\u201d</p><p>After all these years, Roy shouldn\u2019t be surprised by anything his wife did. In this instance, however, her sense of timing was uncanny. \u201cWhat about Linnette?\u201d He\u2019d always been close to his daughter, and confessing his failures to Linnette, and Mack, too, wasn\u2019t going to be easy.</p> <p>\u201cI thought we should tell them one at a time.\u201d She met his eyes. \u201cIs that the way you\u2019d like to do it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. Telling his children...This, above everything else, would be the most difficult part of the whole situation.</p><p>Mack arrived at nine. Roy didn\u2019t know what Corrie had said to persuade him to drive from south Seattle to Cedar Cove this early in the morning. Generally, Mack avoided his father. And thinking back over the last few years, Roy accepted the blame for their estrangement.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t completely sure when this rift between them had started\u2014when Mack was in high school probably. Roy had wanted his son to play football the way he had; Mack chose soccer. In his disappointment, Roy had refused to attend any of Mack\u2019s games. That had been childish, and he regretted it deeply. From then on, their relationship had degenerated into a clash of wills. It almost seemed as if Mack had made a point of provoking his father. Corrie\u2019s heartbreak was something else Roy laid at his own door.</p><p>Mack stood awkwardly in the living room, hands tucked in his pockets. \u201cMom. Dad.\u201d He acknowledged each one with a curt nod. \u201cYou wanted to talk to me?\u201d</p><p>Corrie nodded and indicated he should sit down. Mack did, perching on the outer edge of the chair, presumably in case he needed to make a fast getaway. He was a fine-looking young man, Roy thought, studying his son as though he were a stranger. As tall as Roy was himself, he had curly hair, which he wore longer than Roy liked\u2014no doubt why Mack had chosen that style.</p><p>Roy looked at Corrie and she looked at him. They should have discussed the best way to broach the subject beforehand. He understood why they hadn\u2019t. Talking about their first daughter was just too painful.</p><p>\u201cYour mother and I have something to tell you,\u201d Roy announced, sitting beside Corrie on the sofa.</p><p>She reached for a tissue and wadded it tightly.</p><p>Mack went very still. He frowned. \u201cAre you two...splitting?\u201d</p><p>Roy shook his head. \u201cNever,\u201d he said, taking Corrie\u2019s hand. \u201cYour mother\u2019s stuck with me for the rest of our natural lives.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to reassure their son, who smiled briefly.</p><p>\u201cBefore we explain why we asked you to come over this morning, there\u2019s something I need to say first.\u201d Roy cleared his throat. This seemed to be the day for difficult conversations. \u201cI love my wife and I love my children.\u201d</p><p>Mack shrugged, seemingly indifferent.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m attempting to tell you, Mack, is that I love you. You\u2019re my son. My only son. I know we\u2019ve had our differences over the years, and I blame myself for those. From the time you were a teenager, I gave you the impression that you were a disappointment to me. You weren\u2019t. And you aren\u2019t. I expected you to live up to what I felt was your potential\u2014not that it was my right to determine what you should be or do. But despite everything, you followed your own path. That took grit and character.\u201d He paused and looked away. \u201cI\u2019m proud to call you my son.\u201d</p><p>Mack stared at him hard, as if he wasn\u2019t sure what to say.</p><p>Roy stood, extending his hand. Mack met him halfway but it wasn\u2019t a handshake they shared, it was a hug. By the time Roy sat next to Corrie again, his eyes were moist, and he saw that Mack\u2019s were, too.</p><p>Corrie didn\u2019t pretend to hide her own tears, which streamed down her face unchecked. \u201cThere\u2019s...more,\u201d she said after a few moments.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d Mack glanced at Roy, who nodded.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else you need to know,\u201d Roy said, studying his hands. \u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to say this.\u201d</p><p>Mack leapt to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019ve got cancer!\u201d</p><p>When Roy shook his head, Mack subsided into his chair but still looked apprehensive.</p><p>\u201cYou mean this father-son thing doesn\u2019t have anything to do with...why you asked me to come over this morning?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but what I\u2019m about to tell you will come as a shock.\u201d And he launched into the whole story.</p><p>Their news did astound Mack. He held up his hand and stopped Roy halfway through. \u201cYou mean to say you got Mom pregnant when you were in college?\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know,\u201d Corrie explained hurriedly. \u201cI never told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t.\u201d Roy wasn\u2019t willing to let Corrie take all the responsibility for this. \u201cAnd that was my fault. But it doesn\u2019t matter now. We want you to know you have a sister who was given up for adoption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Once again Mack was on his feet. He clutched his head with both hands, as if to hold all his thoughts inside. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who\u2019s been sending you those postcards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe believe so,\u201d Corrie said quietly.</p><p>\u201cAnother sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have two older sisters,\u201d he whispered, obviously finding this hard to take in. \u201cDoes Linnette know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Mack continued to gaze at them in astonishment. \u201cWhen do you plan on telling her?\u201d</p><p>The relief Roy felt at revealing this part of his past with Mack made him want to finish what they\u2019d started. \u201cLet\u2019s do it now,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll phone Linnette,\u201d Corrie said, sharing his eagerness.</p><p>While she was in the kitchen, Roy and Mack sat in the living room, still a bit awkward with each other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been doing some hiking in the Olympic rain forest,\u201d Mack remarked.</p><p>\u201cI always enjoyed hiking myself,\u201d Roy said, and then added tentatively, \u201cperhaps one weekend the two of us could do a day hike. There are some great ones in this area.\u201d</p><p>Mack grinned. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>Corrie returned from the kitchen. \u201cLinnette has some kind of arrangement with a friend this morning. But she said if we came right away, she\u2019s got half an hour.\u201d</p><p>They piled into Roy\u2019s car and he drove to the apartment complex on the Cedar Cove waterfront. Their daughter met them at her front door.</p><p>Linnette noticed the changed relationship between Roy and Mack immediately. \u201cHey, you guys,\u201d she said as the three of them gathered in her living room. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrepare to be surprised,\u201d Mack said, exchanging a grin with Roy. \u201cYou\u2019d better sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be good news,\u201d she said, glancing from one to the other with a puzzled frown.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful news,\u201d Mack said.</p><p>Linnette spread her hands wide. \u201cThen tell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a sister,\u201d Mack blurted out.</p><p>Reacting the same way as her brother, Linnette was instantly on her feet. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, refusing to omit any detail, Corrie and Roy told their story for the second time that morning.</p><p>Linnette sat dumbfounded, hardly able to ask questions. \u201cI have a sister?\u201d she repeated. \u201cWe have a sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell you,\u201d Corrie said. \u201cA dozen times, at least, I tried. But you always seemed to have something going on in your own life and I didn\u2019t want to burden you with more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mom, I can\u2019t imagine you going through this alone. You were so young....\u201d</p><p>That sufficiently elevated Roy\u2019s guilt. When Corrie answered their daughter, she didn\u2019t blame him, nor did she discount how agonizing a time it had been. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI was fortunate to have supportive parents,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey never pressured me one way or the other when it came to deciding my baby\u2019s future.

He was closest to the front door.</p><p>Gloria\u2019s eyes widened when Roy let her into the apartment. \u201cI believe we\u2019ve met,\u201d he said, extending his hand. \u201cI\u2019m Linnette\u2019s father\u2014and yours.\u201d He heard the gasp behind him as his family took in what he\u2019d just said.</p> <p>Gloria gave him a slow smile. \u201cI wondered when you\u2019d figure it out.\u201d</p><p>Roy hugged her, nearly choking on emotion. Then he turned to face his family, one arm around Gloria\u2019s waist. \u201cCorrie, this is our daughter.\u201d</p><p>Corrie rushed forward, tears flowing down her face, and threw her arms around Gloria. \u201cOh, baby,\u201d she murmured. \u201cMy baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGloria,\u201d Linnette said in a shocked voice. \u201cYou? It\u2019s you?\u201d</p><p>Gloria, who was weeping now, nodded. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how excited I was when I discovered you were my new neighbor. It seemed like fate when you moved in practically next door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI felt a bond with you from the beginning,\u201d Linnette told her.</p><p>Gloria wiped the tears from her cheeks. \u201cNow you know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you find us?\u201d Corrie asked.</p><p>\u201cThrough my grandmother. Apparently she knew your mother and, when Gran heard Corrie was pregnant, she approached your mother on behalf of her daughter and son-in-law. It was a private adoption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should\u2019ve known that,\u201d Corrie whispered, \u201cbut I was so lost in my own pain I didn\u2019t pay much attention.\u201d</p><p>Roy reached for her hand and gripped it hard.</p> <p>\u201cMy mother never said a word,\u201d Corrie said, frowning, \u201cnot even in her journals. Perhaps she was afraid I\u2019d read them one day\u2014which I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat made you come and look for us?\u201d Mack wanted to know.</p><p>Gloria looked at him, then stared out the window, unseeing. \u201cMy parents were killed five years ago in a small-plane accident. Dad loved to fly, and the three of us had scheduled a day trip to Fresno, where Dad was hoping to buy property. I had to cancel at the last minute, not knowing I\u2019d never see my family again.\u201d Fresh tears gleamed in her eyes. \u201cMy grandmother, who was my only surviving relative, helped me bury them.\u201d She swallowed hard and waited before continuing her story. \u201cLosing her daughter devastated Gran. When she knew she was dying, she told me I had another family and that I should look them up. She couldn\u2019t bear the thought of me being alone.\u201d There was another pause. \u201cShe died a week after telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were able to track us down easily enough. But why did you address the postcards to me?\u201d Roy asked.</p><p>Gloria glanced down. \u201cI was hurt and angry. I saw my original birth certificate and realized you hadn\u2019t signed off on the adoption. My grandmother said you weren\u2019t in the picture. I felt you\u2019d abandoned my mother, so I wanted you to wonder\u2014and worry.\u201d She paused, swallowing hard. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that way anymore.\u201d Her gaze slid to Corrie. \u201cYou love her and\u2014your children. I see that now. I know I should\u2019ve gone about this differently. But once I started mailing the postcards and everything, I didn\u2019t feel I could stop until you found me. Do you understand what I mean?\u201d At Roy\u2019s silent nod, she said, \u201cIt was wrong and I apologize for that.\u201d</p><p>Linnette stood and walked over to Gloria, placing both arms around her. \u201cRight or wrong, I\u2019m so grateful you found us,\u201d she breathed. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how much I\u2019ve always wanted a sister. Do you remember, Mom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Corrie whispered, still fighting her emotions.</p><p>\u201cAt first I wasn\u2019t going to do it,\u201d Gloria said, facing Corrie. \u201cI figured you hadn\u2019t wanted me, so I didn\u2019t want you\u2014which wasn\u2019t true. However, I wasn\u2019t planning to intrude on your life. But then I learned you\u2019d married my father and that I had two full siblings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt took me a while to work it all out,\u201d Roy said. \u201cStill, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Mack interrupted. \u201cAren\u2019t you in police work? Just the way Dad used to be?\u201d</p><p>Gloria nodded.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad,\u201d Mack said. \u201cYou finally got your wish. One of us followed in your footsteps.\u201d</p><p>Roy smiled. He had his family with him. His whole family.</p><p>Forty-Six</p><p>Grace stopped at the house on Rosewood Lane on her way home from the library. It was the Monday following Easter. Little by little, she\u2019d moved most of her possessions to Cliff\u2019s house\u2014clothes, books, important papers. Saturday morning, Cliff had brought his truck and they\u2019d packed up the last of her things, except for the larger pieces of furniture. He wanted her completely moved into his home. However, Cliff had suggested she not leave the house vacant much longer, fearing it would invite vandalism. Grace thought that was unlikely, since there wasn\u2019t much crime in Cedar Cove\u2014but then she remembered that incident of arson in the park.</p><p>Her husband\u2014she wondered if she\u2019d ever grow accustomed to thinking of Cliff as her husband\u2014was right. It was time to reach a decision, hard though that would be. The small house on Rosewood had been her home for more than thirty years, and she found placing it on the market a painful and difficult prospect. But Grace was afraid that renting it out would be too much extra work for her and Cliff, and she didn\u2019t want that.</p><p>Kelly had been born while she and Dan lived in this house. Both Maryellen and Kelly had attended elementary school around the corner. The girls had gone through the traumatic teen years here. When they\u2019d grown up and moved away, Grace and Dan had briefly experienced the empty-nest syndrome.</p><p>The neighbors on Rosewood Lane were her friends. When Grace had gone back to school for her degree in library science, Mrs. Vessey across the street used to babysit the girls after class until Dan got home from work. Mrs. Jennings down the road had two daughters the same age as Grace\u2019s. They still compared notes. These days their conversations were mostly about gardening.</p><p>Her rose garden. That was something else Grace didn\u2019t feel she could leave. Working on her roses had brought her such comfort in those early months after Dan\u2019s disappearance.</p><p>At the thought of her dead husband, Grace grew teary-eyed and sad. Kelly and Paul had recently announced that they were expecting another child. Dan would have loved his grandchildren. He\u2019d loved both girls; she\u2019d never doubted that, although he\u2019d felt closer to Kelly. He\u2019d been alive when their youngest daughter learned she was pregnant with Tyler. Until Dan\u2019s body was found, Kelly had refused to let go of her belief that he\u2019d return, with a perfectly logical explanation of where he\u2019d gone and why.</p><p>That was never to be. The demons that haunted Dan had been merciless and unforgiving. How she wished he could have talked to her about his ordeal in Vietnam. Perhaps then, the outcome might have been different.</p><p>His suicide was her life\u2019s greatest tragedy.</p><p>Because Dan was on her mind, Grace went out to the garage, which had been her husband\u2019s domain. She missed not having Buttercup at her side.</p><p>As she walked through the garage, turning on the lights, Grace remembered the day she\u2019d discovered that Dan had destroyed the last Christmas gifts she and the girls had given him. At the time she\u2019d been filled with rage and grief, incapable of understanding why he\u2019d done something so cruel. She\u2019d assumed he hated her, hated his life with her. She\u2019d assumed wrong. The person Dan hated was himself. She understood now that Dan hadn\u2019t considered himself worthy of those gifts. Because of that, he\u2019d repeatedly turned his back on any good thing life had to offer.</p><p>Most of what was in the garage had belonged to Dan. Grace didn\u2019t know what to do with his tools or the expensive tree-cutting equipment. Sell it, she supposed. Other than a few photographs\u2014and her memories\u2014this was all that was left of her dead husband. Kneeling on the cold concrete, she peeked inside a couple of the cartons and saw books and old magazines. How sad that Dan\u2019s legacy to his family was reduced to a few cardboard boxes.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d find you here.\u201d Cliff\u2019s gentle voice came to her.</p><p>Startled, she glanced up, surprised to find it dark outside. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAlmost eight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d been in the garage so long. It felt like only a few minutes. Unable to resist checking her watch, she confirmed that Cliff was right.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything you need to take back to the house?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThis was Dan\u2019s stuff.\u201d</p><p>Cliff stepped into the garage. \u201cYou\u2019re wondering what to do with it now?\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled, grateful her husband understood. \u201cI could always give it to the girls, I suppose.\u201d Although what Maryellen and Kelly would do with it was another question.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t really the problem, is it?\u201d Cliff said softly. He looked around, although she was sure he\u2019d been here a dozen times. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to let go of the house, do you?\u201d</p><p>When he said this, she recognized her reluctance for what it was. \u201cNo,\u201d she confessed. \u201cNo...I can\u2019t. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen keep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind if we rent it? Even though dealing with tenants is a bother...\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrace, no. Of course I don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s your home to do with as you wish. And if we choose the right tenants, it won\u2019t be much bother.\u201d</p><p>She felt a great sense of relief and slipped her arms around Cliff\u2019s waist, hugging him close. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d He sounded amused.</p><p>\u201cFor loving me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, my dear,\u201d he said, lifting her chin so she could look into his eyes, \u201cis the easy part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you so much.\u201d Her feelings for him, and her lingering grief over Dan, brought her close to tears.</p><p>His arms circled her. \u201cI know you do.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cAre you ready to come home now?\u201d</p><p>Grace nodded. Home, she told herself, was wherever Cliff was.</p><p>With his arm about her waist, he led her out of the garage. \u201cYou haven\u2019t had dinner, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Now that he mentioned it, she realized how hungry she was. At that very moment, her stomach growled as if to verify the fact.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to stop somewhere in town and eat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She smiled gratefully. \u201cThat\u2019s a wonderful idea.\u201d</p><p>Despite not having reservations, they decided to try The Lighthouse, which was doing good business for a Monday night, if the packed parking lot was any indication. When they got inside, Justine seated them immediately\u2014to Grace\u2019s pleasure and gratitude. As they ordered a glass of wine, she noticed Cal and Linnette McAfee. They sat not far away, their heads close together. This was definitely a romance in the making. Grace wasn\u2019t sure what had happened, but all at once those two seemed to be a real couple. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on between Cal and the McAfees\u2019daughter?\u201d Grace asked in a low voice, leaning toward her husband.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Cliff answered. Their eyes met above the menu and Cliff raised his eyebrows. \u201cI asked Cal the other day and he pretended not to hear. I guess he doesn\u2019t want to tell me. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed he\u2019s a very private person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he wasn\u2019t interested in Linnette.\u201d</p><p>Cliff shrugged. \u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s been saying for months, but from all appearances, his feelings have changed\u2014a lot.\u201d</p> <p>Grace didn\u2019t see much of Cal these days. By the time she left the ranch to drive into Cedar Cove, he was already busy with the horses, either in the barn or one of the pastures. In the evenings, Cal gave the newlyweds their privacy. Grace hadn\u2019t said more than a few words to him in the two and a half weeks since they\u2019d returned to the ranch.</p><p>\u201cJudging by the way he\u2019s acting, I\u2019d say he\u2019s in love,\u201d Cliff said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d Grace asked, although she shared his suspicion.</p><p>Cliff\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cCal Washburn walks around with a dopey look most of the time.\u201d He hesitated, and a smile lit up his face. \u201cAs a matter of fact, so do I.\u201d</p><p>Her husband\u2019s words warmed her heart. \u201cMe, too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMe, too, Cliff.\u201d</p> <p>Cliff set aside his menu and reached across the table for her hand. She was grateful he\u2019d read her mood so accurately. She needed this time just for them, in a place that was neutral, that wasn\u2019t her house or his.</p><p>Seeing that they were ready to order, the waitress hurried to the table, pad in hand. Grace chose the halibut in shrimp curry sauce, and Cliff asked for a T-bone steak.</p><p>Both dishes were excellent. Grace was thrilled that Cedar Cove had such an outstanding restaurant. She was proud of Justine and Seth and the success they\u2019d made of this enterprise. Having worked as a commercial fisherman, Seth knew good fish and seafood, and served only the freshest. She could see that owning a restaurant was demanding, but so far the couple\u2019s marriage seemed to be withstanding the pressures. Grace hoped that wouldn\u2019t change.</p><p>When they\u2019d finished, Cliff paid their bill. \u201cReady to leave?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Grace told him she was. While Cliff retrieved her coat, she saw that Cal and Linnette were lingering over coffee; Grace smiled at them but they were completely absorbed in each other.</p><p>In the parking lot, where she and Cliff had both left their vehicles, he insisted on checking her car. She followed him home, arriving a minute or two after him. He waited for her outside the house while she parked in the space he\u2019d cleared in the garage. When she joined him, Cliff placed one arm around her shoulders. Yawning, he covered his mouth with the other hand.</p> <p>\u201cIs that a hint, Cliff Harding?\u201d she teased and playfully elbowed him in the ribs. He had a vigorous sexual appetite, although they were still a bit shy with each other. She knew exactly what he meant\u2014he wanted to go to bed...and not because he was tired.</p><p>\u201cWell, I guess you could say so.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and slipped her arm around him, resting her head on his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s late, isn\u2019t it? We should\u2019ve been in bed hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014extremely late. So we\u2019d better get a move on.\u201d</p><p>Grace smiled to herself. After all, she wanted the same thing her husband did.</p><p>Forty-Seven</p><p>Cecilia woke from a sound sleep at Aaron\u2019s first cry. She groaned inwardly and glanced at the clock-radio on the nightstand\u20144:10 a.m. It\u2019d been four hours since she\u2019d last nursed. Aaron was hungry again and he wouldn\u2019t return to sleep until he\u2019d been fed.</p><p>Ian rolled over when she climbed out of bed. \u201cNeed any help?\u201d he asked sleepily.</p> <p>\u201cNo thanks, sweetheart.\u201d It wasn\u2019t as if her husband could give Aaron his breakfast. Breast-feeding was a new experience; she\u2019d never had the opportunity to nurse Allison. She\u2019d pumped her breasts, wanting to believe that her milk would somehow provide the sustenance to pull Allison through her medical crisis. Sadly, it hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Carefully lifting Aaron from his crib, she shushed the newborn, who was crying hard enough to wake the neighbors. Cecilia soothed him with gentle whispers as she changed his diaper and settled in the living room rocker. Singing softly to him, she unbuttoned the front of her nightgown and gave a slight gasp when her hungry son latched onto her nipple.</p><p>Ian\u2019s barely discernible laugh caught her attention. \u201cI have a strong son,\u201d he said, walking into the room. He was barefoot and wore only the bottom half of his pajamas.</p><p>While Cecilia rocked and nursed the baby, Ian sat across from her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to get out of bed for this,\u201d she felt obliged to tell him.</p><p>\u201cI know. I wanted to. It\u2019s been two weeks now, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get tired of watching you nurse our son.\u201d</p><p>She brushed the tiny wisps of hair away from Aaron\u2019s sweet face and gazed down at him in utter amazement as tiny milk bubbles formed at his mouth.</p><p>\u201cFrom the first moment I saw you, I thought you were beautiful,\u201d Ian whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, stop.\u201d His compliments embarrassed her.</p><p>\u201cYou were,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cBut you\u2019ve never looked more beautiful than you do right this minute.\u201d</p><p>His words filled her heart. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He seemed about to say something else, but paused, as if caught up in the emotion of the moment. After a while he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about us finding a house to rent. Maybe with an option to buy.\u201d</p><p>She smiled at him quickly. \u201cI\u2019d like that. Where?\u201d</p><p>Ian shrugged. \u201cCedar Cove. I want our son to have a real yard to play in and a neighborhood with other families, other kids. Living in a duplex is fine for you and me, but we have a baby now who\u2019ll need room to grow. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s start looking today!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check with a rental agent to see what we can find.\u201d</p><p>Cecilia nodded, excited by the idea.</p><p>As soon as Aaron was satisfied, he fell asleep. Holding him over her shoulder, Cecilia rocked for several minutes until she felt she could place him in his crib again without fear of waking him.</p><p>Ian crawled into bed and pulled aside the covers so she could join him. Cecilia curled up against her husband, but after a few minutes, she shifted away in an effort to get comfortable. Ten minutes later she was back.</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d Ian suggested when her restlessness didn\u2019t end.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to keep you awake,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either you talk or you wake me every time you roll from one side to the other. I might be on leave, but I still need my sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Allison Cox,\u201d Cecilia said reluctantly. She hadn\u2019t intended to mention this to Ian, but the girl had been in her thoughts ever since yesterday afternoon, when she\u2019d stopped by the house to visit Aaron. Allison had confided in her and spent the better part of the afternoon unburdening her woes.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re not too keen on this new boyfriend of hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cecilia murmured. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe isn\u2019t planning to run away and marry him, is she?\u201d Ian asked in a sleepy voice.</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d But Cecilia was afraid that whatever Anson requested, Allison would do.</p><p>\u201cThen it can\u2019t be too serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bet on it.\u201d Cecilia nestled more comfortably in the crook of her husband\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, Ian\u2014this kid is trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he hanging around Allison a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not. He had some sort of confrontation with her recently and she hasn\u2019t seen him since.\u201d Cecilia paused, biting her lip. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t shown up for school, either, which worries her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she try to find out where he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked her, and she started to cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Ian pressed when she didn\u2019t immediately continue.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Allison, Anson\u2019s mother claims she hadn\u2019t seen him for a few days, which she doesn\u2019t happen to think is any big deal. Can you imagine that? Anson\u2019s eighteen now, but it shouldn\u2019t matter what age he is. If he\u2019s living at home and he disappears, then the woman should be concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely he has friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison says he runs with a rough crowd.\u201d This didn\u2019t surprise Cecilia; kids like Anson and his buddies weren\u2019t the type of friends she wanted Allison to have, but she dared not let the girl know that.</p><p>\u201cHasn\u2019t anyone checked with these guys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect Allison has. But if she found out anything, she didn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>Ian was silent after that.</p><p>\u201cAllison\u2019s really worried, and I don\u2019t blame her. She asked her father to talk to Seth Gunderson.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia realized she\u2019d never filled in this part of the story for Ian. \u201cBack in December, Mr. Cox spoke to Seth on Anson\u2019s behalf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was good of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Cox was the one who recommended Anson for the job, so he feels responsible for what happened. He wanted to hear what Seth had to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he learn?\u201d</p><p>This was where it became confusing for Cecilia. \u201cWell, Mr. Gunderson said he wasn\u2019t a hundred percent positive that it was Anson who took the money, and because he couldn\u2019t be sure, he laid off another of the kitchen staff, too. Both had opportunity. Naturally, Allison believes the other guy did it. She says this Tony was out to get Anson because he made Tony look bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>Cecilia gave a small shrug. \u201cSupposedly because Anson was such a hard worker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat certainly gave Tony a motive, didn\u2019t it? And Anson, too\u2014if he thinks Tony\u2019s been on his case, maybe spreading rumors about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I figured,\u201d Cecilia agreed. She couldn\u2019t blame Seth Gunderson for laying off Anson. He had the motive, the opportunity and the reputation.</p><p>Her husband was quiet for several minutes. \u201cThat\u2019s all true,\u201d he finally said, \u201cand I wouldn\u2019t totally rule him out, but in my opinion, the kid\u2019s gotten a bad break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t right for Allison,\u201d Cecilia insisted.</p><p>Ian was quiet again, and then he said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t listen to the people who told you it was a mistake to go out with a Navy guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ian.\u201d She turned into his embrace. \u201cI\u2019m glad, too.\u201d</p><p>She was. Not only that, her husband had given her something to think about.</p><p>Forty-Eight</p><p>Rachel laughed at Jane\u2019s joke as they walked out to the parking lot after work on Saturday. It was the shop\u2019s busiest day and she\u2019d been on her feet for almost ten hours; she was exhausted. Laughter was a good release, even if the joke had been silly and a little off-color. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The parking lot was dark, only fitfully illuminated by nearby streetlights. Approaching her car, keys in hand, Rachel stopped abruptly when a tall, lean man came out of the shadows. Terrified, she couldn\u2019t move.</p><p>Until the man spoke.</p><p>\u201cRachel, it\u2019s Nate.\u201d</p><p>She felt instantly weak until the anger kicked in, rescuing her. \u201cYou scared me out of ten years of my life,\u201d she snapped. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing, hiding in the shadows like that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be!\u201d</p><p>He held up both hands. \u201cAll I wanted to do was talk. I wasn\u2019t interested in starting World War Three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve thought of that before you came sneaking up on me.\u201d Just then, Jane drove by and slowed down as if to check out the situation. As soon as she recognized Nate, a gigantic smile formed and with a wave, she drove off.</p><p>Undeterred, Rachel went on. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t gouge out your eyes with my car key.\u201d The anger concealed her elation. Rachel didn\u2019t want to be this happy, and that made her feel even angrier at herself for reacting to him. \u201cFurthermore,\u201d she added in a flustered voice, \u201cwhy are you lurking in the shadows like...like some stalker?\u201d She inserted her key in the lock and yanked open the door.</p> <p>\u201cLike I said, I came to talk to you.\u201d He didn\u2019t back down. They stood several feet apart\u2014which was too close. Far too close.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Rachel. I can\u2019t help it. I was going to let you have your own way, but I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>She wished he hadn\u2019t said that. Every time he opened his mouth she weakened a little more. \u201cThis is not a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI happen to think it\u2019s an excellent idea.\u201d He advanced one small step toward her.</p><p>Heart pounding, Rachel held out her arm. \u201cStop right where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll call for a security guard.\u201d</p><p>Still he came. \u201cYou do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate...no.\u201d But he reached her and gently took her by the shoulders and brought her toward him. She couldn\u2019t fight him. Instead, the minute he touched her, she swayed into his arms as if she belonged there. When he kissed her, she had to grab his shirt collar just to remain upright.</p><p>\u201cRachel, Rachel,\u201d he murmured between kisses that left her clinging and breathless. \u201cWhy did you shut me out of your life?\u201d</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t said anything, she might have forgotten, at least for the length of another kiss. But, no, he had to go and remind her why a relationship was impossible.</p><p>She forced herself to pull away, then dragged in a deep breath and prayed she could get enough oxygen into her brain to think clearly.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t,\u201d he protested. \u201cI\u2019m not letting you go that easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNate\u2014it won\u2019t work.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho says?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re wrong. I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know me.\u201d He was making this more difficult than it had to be. \u201cI\u2019m just another way to thumb your nose at your family. I...refuse\u2014don\u2019t you dare kiss me again! Oh...Oh.\u201d The fight went out of her as his mouth found hers. His kisses were hungry and demanding and each seemed more potent than the one before. Her knees wobbled and her heart fluttered and if she didn\u2019t do something soon, they\u2019d end up at her house, in her bed....</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Nate said, his breathing uneven.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Where she found the strength to deny him anything, she didn\u2019t know. \u201cI told you, this won\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>He gripped her shoulders and his eyes bore into hers. \u201cI\u2019m only going to say this once, so listen carefully.\u201d</p><p>At his touch she was dumbfounded.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand me?\u201d</p><p>Somehow, she managed to nod.</p><p>\u201cGood. Rachel Pendergast, I love you. I am my own person. I always have been. I love my parents, but I won\u2019t allow them to dictate my life. My father is a congressman. I\u2019m a Warrant Officer in the United States Navy. It\u2019s a job I enjoy and a rank I earned by my own merit. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Again she nodded.</p><p>\u201cMy father doesn\u2019t tell me what to do\u2014or who to love. I make my own decisions. Got it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo buts. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Rachel hung her head. \u201cDon\u2019t love me. Please, don\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her chin so she couldn\u2019t avoid meeting his gaze. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to argue with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...oh, Nate.\u201d She threw her arms around him. \u201cI missed you, too\u2014so much.\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply, and slipped both arms about her waist, lifting her off the ground. \u201cIt took you long enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m frightened,\u201d she whispered. And she was. If they permitted this relationship to continue, the time would come when she\u2019d have to meet his family. It went without saying that they wouldn\u2019t approve; there was absolutely nothing to endear her to his parents. No status, no wealth, no education to speak of. She\u2019d been raised by an aunt who\u2019d died when she was nineteen, and she\u2019d been on her own from that point forward. Dogs at the pound had a better pedigree than she did.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any family,\u201d she said, ashamed to admit this to a man who had such an important one.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d She sighed. \u201cWhy do you make this so hard? Why won\u2019t you just let me go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re worth keeping. Now, no more arguing. We\u2019re going to talk.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly she agreed. He drove them to the Pancake Palace, where they sat in one of the old-fashioned booths. They couldn\u2019t stop staring at each other. When the waitress came, they both ordered coffee and banana splits, but the ice cream melted and the coffee grew cold before they even noticed it.</p><p>Finally Rachel reached for her spoon, then put it down again. \u201cAll right. Seeing that you\u2019re the one with the big ideas, where do we go from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight where we left off when I shipped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were dating. You were my girl, and I was your bachelor prize.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cNate, that sounds like something out of a 1950s movie. I should be wearing saddle shoes and a poodle skirt, and we should be listening to Bobby Darrin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure they have some Bobby Darrin on the jukebox here,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Bruce?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI think it might be a good idea if you told him you won\u2019t be seeing him anymore.\u201d Nate leaned all the way over and pressed his lips to hers. \u201cYou\u2019ve already got one steady,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need two.\u201d</p><p>Steady? Sandra Dee and Frankie Avalon were going to waltz in here any minute.</p><p>Still, she knew what Nate meant\u2014and she knew he was right. Jolene would be unhappy, but Rachel\u2019s confused relationship with Bruce simply couldn\u2019t go on.</p><p>Forty-Nine</p><p>Allison woke to the sound of a light tap on her bedroom window. Her heart flew to her throat and she gasped. It could only be Anson. She didn\u2019t care what time of day or night it was, she had to talk to him. In her eagerness to get to the window, she nearly fell out of bed.</p><p>Sure enough, Anson stood there in the yard, his shoulders hunched against the cold March wind. In the faint moonlight she could see that he wore his black coat and watch cap and was peering into the darkened room. When she approached the window, he stepped back. Without question Allison opened it for him.</p><p>\u201cAnson,\u201d she cried. \u201cWhere have you been? I\u2019ve been worried sick about you.\u201d It was two weeks since she\u2019d seen him, that day in the mall. He hadn\u2019t been to school. None of his friends seemed to know where he was. He\u2019d vanished; no one had seen him anywhere. When she broke down and phoned his mother, Mrs. Butler didn\u2019t show any interest or concern.</p><p>Anson didn\u2019t answer nor did he climb inside her bedroom, as he had the last time he\u2019d visited her in the middle of the night.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d she urged. \u201cIt\u2019s cold.\u201d She moved aside, but he remained out in the wind and the cold. \u201cAnson,\u201d she said, \u201cget in here! You must be half frozen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He shook his head wildly. \u201cThe only reason I\u2019m here is to say goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodbye?\u201d Her mind was spinning. \u201cWhy? Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged as if that was of no significance. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201d</p><p>Allison rubbed her hands up and down her arms, shivering with cold. \u201cCome in. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Again Anson refused. If anything, he moved back another step.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she added softly.</p><p>He considered it for a moment. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he finally muttered. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to steel himself against her. \u201cLike I said, the only reason I\u2019m here is to tell you I won\u2019t be seeing you anymore.\u201d</p><p>The shock of his words felt like a slap across her face. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that! You can\u2019t mean that.\u201d She swallowed down the hurt and disappointment. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t,\u201d he said sharply, as if her confession had angered him. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t figured it out yet, I\u2019m a loser. I\u2019m not going anyplace but down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d But Anson wasn\u2019t listening.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to drag you down, too,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d she argued hotly, furious that he\u2019d say it about himself. \u201cYou\u2019re not a loser. You\u2019re not.\u201d She suspected he was just repeating what his mother had told him all his life.</p><p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s a good guy,\u201d he said. \u201cThank him for me, all right?\u201d He started to turn away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d She leaned out of the window and grabbed for him. She would\u2019ve fallen onto the ground if Anson hadn\u2019t caught her. Once she was in his embrace, practically dangling from the window, she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. At first he resisted and attempted to shove her away. But soon he was returning her kisses. Then, apparently reaching some decision, he tore his mouth from hers and pulled back.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged. \u201cCome in so we can talk about this properly. Don\u2019t walk away from me\u2014not like this.\u201d</p><p>Reluctantly he nodded. While he climbed in through the bedroom window, Allison found her thick fleece housecoat and put it on. Shivering, still shaking with cold, she tied the sash around her waist.</p><p>Anson sat on the end of her bed, his head lowered. \u201cNothing you say is going to change my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love me,\u201d she whispered, kneeling on the floor in front of him. \u201cDon\u2019t deny it, because I know it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, a tortured expression on his face. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come,\u201d he muttered. She suspected he said it more for his own benefit than hers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She placed her hands over his. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful you did. You can\u2019t leave me. I won\u2019t let you.\u201d She got to her feet. \u201cIf you go, then I\u2019m going with you.\u201d There was no alternative, she decided, no other choice. \u201cWherever you go, that\u2019s where I want to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word was chilling in its intensity.</p><p>\u201cAnson, you\u2019ve got to listen to me. This is all because of what happened at The Lighthouse, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He refused to answer, refused to look at her.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad believes you. I believe you. Doesn\u2019t that mean anything?\u201d</p><p>He seemed to think about it, then shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? This is how it is\u2014everything I touch turns to dust. I thought it\u2019d be different with you, but it\u2019s not. I\u2019m getting out of here before I screw up your life, too.\u201d He scrambled to his feet and started for the window.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going,\u201d she said in a hoarse whisper. Then she remembered something else. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou\u2019ll be breaking the terms of your plea bargain. You have to stay in school, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was supposed to have a job, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Anson shook his head again. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to worry about that. If they find me now, I\u2019ll probably get jail time. I\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p><p>A dozen questions rose at his response. She didn\u2019t ask a single one because she was afraid of the answers. \u201cWhat will you do for money?\u201d</p><p>He turned back and gave a harsh laugh.</p><p>\u201cAnson?\u201d She\u2019d never heard him sound like that before, and it frightened her. Her stomach knotted as she realized there was a reason Anson had chosen to leave Cedar Cove tonight. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s better if you don\u2019t know.\u201d His eyes softened as he looked at her one last time. \u201cGoodbye,\u201d he whispered, stretching out his hand to touch her face.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She hurried to the window, but he was too fast. He moved with an agility that belied his size. \u201cHow will I know where to reach you?\u201d she called out as he walked across the grass.</p> <p>Anson didn\u2019t answer. His hands were buried deep inside his pockets, his shoulders bent. She stayed where she was until she lost sight of him, and in her heart she knew she\u2019d never see him again. Eventually the tears came, flooding her eyes and rolling down her cheeks. She closed the window and crawled back into bed.</p><p>Allison didn\u2019t fall asleep for hours. Her pillow was damp with tears when she woke Saturday morning, again to the sound of knocking\u2014but this time it was someone pounding at her bedroom door.</p><p>\u201cAllison,\u201d her mother said, opening the door. \u201cIt\u2019s after ten.\u201d</p><p>She sat up in bed and rubbed her eyes. She often slept in on the weekends.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone here who wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Her first thought was that it might be Anson, but she realized that it wouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Sheriff Davis.\u201d Her mother\u2019s expression was serious, and Allison\u2019s stomach immediately tensed.</p> <p>\u201cWhy does he want to see me?\u201d Even though she asked, she knew the answer. This had to do with Anson.</p><p>\u201cYour father\u2019s talking to the sheriff now. I suggest you get dressed right away and join us.\u201d</p><p>Allison nodded and although she appeared outwardly calm, her heart clamored hard. This was what she\u2019d feared most\u2014that Anson would get into trouble again.</p><p>By the time she\u2019d put on jeans and a sweatshirt and brushed her hair, Allison was shaking. Whatever Anson had done, if he was caught, it would mean the fire in the park would now be part of his permanent record. It also meant her father would never allow her to see him again.</p><p>The sheriff set down his coffee mug when Allison entered the kitchen. He sat at the table with both her parents.</p><p>\u201cThis is our daughter, Allison,\u201d her father said, motioning that she should sit down. \u201cAllison,\u201d he said, looking straight at her. \u201cSheriff Davis has some questions for you. It\u2019s important that you answer him honestly and directly. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>She lowered her head and whispered, \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Allison,\u201d Sheriff Davis said pleasantly. \u201cI hear you\u2019re friends with Anson Butler.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m wondering when you last saw him,\u201d the sheriff said next.</p><p>The minute Anson left, she knew he\u2019d done something he shouldn\u2019t have. He\u2019d as much as said so. His chilling laugh echoed in her mind.</p><p>Her father leaned toward her. \u201cPlease tell Sheriff Davis the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night,\u201d she whispered, knowing her parents would be outraged that she\u2019d let him into her bedroom in the middle of the night.</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout two this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou snuck out of the house?\u201d This outburst was from her mother, who was clearly upset.</p><p>Allison shook her head. \u201cNo. Anson came to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the house?\u201d her father clarified without apparent censure. But his eyes let her know he wasn\u2019t pleased, although he kept his voice even.</p><p>Allison sighed. \u201cHe tapped on my window and woke me up. He\u2014he came to say goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he say where he was going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He said he didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea where he is now?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head a second time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure he ran away, though?\u201d her father said, pressuring her for more information.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been at home or at school. I asked around and no one\u2019s seen him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s he been keeping himself?\u201d This came from the sheriff.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Allison wished she did. All week she\u2019d wondered and waited to hear from him. The thought of Anson living on the streets made her want to weep all over again. His mother wasn\u2019t any help; she didn\u2019t even seem to care.</p><p>\u201cDo you know whether he had any money?\u201d the sheriff asked.</p><p>She hesitated, but for only a second. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say.\u201d</p><p>Sheriff Davis exchanged a look with her father.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do?\u201d Allison had to find out.</p><p>\u201cAt this point we don\u2019t know that Anson did anything,\u201d Sheriff Davis said, his words measured and flat. \u201cHe\u2019s what we consider a person of interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterest in what?\u201d</p><p>Again her father and the sheriff exchanged that ambiguous glance.</p><p>\u201cAbout one this morning, The Lighthouse restaurant burned to the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it arson?\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d the sheriff said, \u201cbut the indication from the fire chief is that the fire appears to have been purposely set.\u201d</p><p>Allison gasped. \u201cAnson would never do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe burned down the shed in the park,\u201d her father reminded her. He placed his hand on her shoulder as if to lend her strength.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d she said, shrugging off his comfort and leaping to her feet. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeth Gunderson laid him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Gunderson thought Anson had taken some money from his office, but he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnson was angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would be, too,\u201d Allison shouted, \u201cif you were unjustly accused of\u2014something.\u201d Her voice broke. She couldn\u2019t believe The Lighthouse was gone. It\u2019d become a Cedar Cove landmark.</p><p>\u201cAs I mentioned, we\u2019re not certain that the fire was arson,\u201d Sheriff Davis said in an obvious attempt to calm her.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re already trying to frame Anson!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAllison.\u201d Her mother spoke her name softly. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to frame him for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I want to do right now is talk to Anson,\u201d the sheriff assured her.</p><p>Allison didn\u2019t believe him. She was convinced the sheriff and her parents considered him guilty. She recognized that he must have done something, but he hadn\u2019t burned down The Lighthouse. Despite any evidence or suspicion to the contrary, she knew one thing: Anson was innocent.</p><p>Justine Gunderson stared at what had once been their restaurant, her arms tight around her son to ward off the cold wind gusting from the cove. Leif was peacefully asleep, thumb in his mouth. Seth stood a few feet apart from her, answering the fire chief\u2019s questions. The stench of fire invaded her nostrils, clung to her clothes and hair. Smoke wafted up from the ashes of what had once been their dream\u2014their restaurant, their investment and sole source of income. Even now, staring at the charred remains, it was hard to believe The Lighthouse was no more. All that survived of the structure was a blackened skeleton and a pile of rubble. With a jolt she recognized the twisted metal frame of a photograph\u2014the picture Jon Bowman had given them when they opened the restaurant.</p><p>After a few minutes, Seth returned to her side and took Leif from her arms. Their son was still asleep so he\u2019d be spared seeing this. Justine felt numb with shock. She couldn\u2019t cry, could barely think.</p><p>\u201cIt was arson,\u201d Seth whispered.</p><p>This was as unbelievable as the fire itself. \u201cWho...who would do such a thing to us?\u201d</p><p>Seth shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fire chief says it was started near the kitchen. We were supposed to think it was a grease fire.\u201d</p><p>This whole situation was becoming more unreal by the minute.</p><p>\u201cWhoever did it was stupid,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cOr else they wanted to be caught.\u201d</p><p>That, at least, was encouraging. Justine wanted whoever had done this to be caught, too. Wanted that person to face his\u2014or her\u2014day in court, to receive the maximum sentence.</p><p>\u201cThe fire chief asked if we had any disgruntled employees,\u201d Seth murmured. He, too, seemed to be in shock.</p><p>\u201cDo we?\u201d Seth was the one who handled the hiring and firing, plus the scheduling of staff. Justine had enough to do working as a hostess and keeping their financial records straight.</p><p>\u201cAnson Butler was pretty angry when I laid him off.\u201d Seth\u2019s voice was hoarse, and he hardly sounded like himself.</p><p>Justine remembered now that Seth had laid off two employees recently. \u201cWhat about the other kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTony Philpott,\u201d Seth told her. \u201cHe seemed to take it in stride. I hear he\u2019s already got another job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe police want to question Anson. He\u2019s missing. They\u2019re looking for him now.\u201d</p><p>Justine leaned close to her husband. \u201cI hope they find him.\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded. He placed his free arm around her shoulders, and pulled her against him. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we will,\u201d Justine said. She just didn\u2019t know how.</p><p>Fifty</p><p>With a heavy heart, Maryellen set down the phone after talking to Kelly. She felt like weeping. Nothing was going right. Bedridden and miserable during this difficult pregnancy, she counted the days until she could get on with her life again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With Maryellen unable to work and contribute to their finances, their budget was stretched to the breaking point. Jon was working as hard as he could to fill orders and make new photographs available. It was tax season, though, and sales of nonessential items were notoriously bad at this time of year.</p><p>When Jon wasn\u2019t developing and printing his photographs, he\u2019d been cooking whatever hours Seth Gunderson could give him at The Lighthouse. Until last weekend, when it burned to the ground in the biggest fire in Cedar Cove\u2019s history. Everyone in town was sick about losing The Lighthouse. The money from Jon\u2019s job at the restaurant was gone now, too. They were back to first base financially.</p><p>As it was, Jon was working constantly to support the family, plus taking care of her, Katie and the upkeep on the house. Her husband was worn out, and Maryellen didn\u2019t know how much longer he could continue this killing pace. The baby, the fire and now this problem with her sister.</p><p>Kelly was pregnant, too, but unfortunately she\u2019d been experiencing terrible bouts of morning sickness. She spent the first half of every day bent over a toilet. Paul had put his foot down; taking care of Katie was simply too much for her, he\u2019d said. Maryellen understood. Her sister wanted to help and felt dreadful about letting everyone down, but she just couldn\u2019t look after Katie anymore.</p> <p>Now Maryellen had to tell her husband that, in addition to everything else, he\u2019d have to supervise their two-year-old daughter. At best, he\u2019d have a ninety-minute reprieve when Katie went down for her nap. Most afternoons she only slept an hour.</p><p>As Jon walked downstairs from his small office, he entered the living room\u2014and obviously realized that something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen patted the empty space next to her on the bed.</p><p>\u201cThat bad?\u201d he said as though this was a joke.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d better sit down,\u201d she said, trying to smile. She suspected the effort was unconvincing. \u201cThat was Kelly on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie\u2019s all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie\u2019s fine.\u201d It was everything else that wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Jon sank down on the foot of her makeshift bed. \u201cThe baby?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen rested her hand on her stomach. \u201cIf all the kicking is any indication, I\u2019d say this baby has more energy than the two of us combined.\u201d</p><p>Jon relaxed and reached for her hand. She\u2019d seen little of him while she was pregnant with Katie, and they both wanted him to share as much of this pregnancy as possible. Maryellen wished it could be a more positive experience.</p> <p>\u201cThings will improve soon,\u201d he reassured her.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she whispered, struggling with what she had to tell him.</p><p>He took her gently in his arms. \u201cDo I need to remind you how much I love you? Without you and Katie, I\u2019m nothing.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen leaned back and took in a deep breath. \u201cKelly\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Jon said, his voice puzzled. They\u2019d talked about the two cousins being born within a few months of each other. Paul and Kelly were ecstatic about this second pregnancy. She\u2019d had difficulty getting pregnant the first time and there would be almost six years between the two children.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been suffering from severe morning sickness again.\u201d Kelly had the same problem when she was pregnant with Tyler. \u201cSo...\u201d</p><p>Jon tensed, as if he knew what was coming. \u201cShe can\u2019t watch Katie anymore.\u201d</p><p>Maryellen nodded wearily. \u201cShe hated to tell me. Kelly feels terrible about this. But chasing after a two-year-old while she\u2019s feeling so sick\u2014she just can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <p>Silently Jon stared into the distance. This was one more burden. Maryellen didn\u2019t dare make the obvious suggestion. In their last letter, his father and stepmother had offered to help. Yet the one time she\u2019d brought up the subject, Jon had rejected the idea in no uncertain terms. She couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, do that again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to think of what we can do,\u201d she whispered, attempting to focus on a solution. \u201cI could keep an eye on Katie in the mornings. It won\u2019t be easy, but I\u2019ll manage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatie is walking and exploring and into everything,\u201d Jon muttered. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can watch her and protect this pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her with me. I used to do that, remember?\u201d</p><p>Maryellen nodded, but they both knew Katie had been an infant in those days. He\u2019d had a special backpack to carry their daughter when he went on his photographic excursions, and young as she was, Katie had loved those times with her daddy. Maryellen could still picture it.</p><p>\u201cMy mother can help.\u201d Even as she spoke, Maryellen knew that wasn\u2019t possible. Grace was a newlywed with a demanding job. Her mother already came to the house two or three times a week. It was the best she could do, but it wasn\u2019t enough. She and Cliff had arranged for a cleaning crew one day the previous month, plus some prepared meals, and Maryellen had been so grateful. But they couldn\u2019t expect that kind of gift again. Cliff and especially Grace had done enough for them.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t ask Grace to do any more than she already is.\u201d Jon said aloud what Maryellen had been thinking.</p><p>\u201cI know....\u201d Tears filled her eyes. The worry and stress were more than she could handle.</p><p>\u201cMaryellen...\u201d</p><p>She covered her face with both hands and bent her head.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, it\u2019ll be all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get a mortgage on the land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she insisted. This land, an inheritance from his grandfather, was everything to Jon. If they lost it, he\u2019d be devastated.</p><p>Her husband was silent for a long time. Finally he stood up and walked away.</p><p>\u201cJon?\u201d she said when she saw that he was returning upstairs. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo make a phone call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo whom?\u201d</p><p>He turned and looked over his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll contact my family, Maryellen. It\u2019s what you want me to do, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer him.</p><p>\u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d she choked out. \u201cBut it\u2019s not my fault\u2014I didn\u2019t make any of this happen, so don\u2019t be angry with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what you want, though, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he persisted.</p><p>It was, but only because it made sense to give his father and stepmother an opportunity to rebuild their relationship with Jon, their only living child. And because Maryellen needed the help. Jon did, too.</p><p>He sighed and wiped a hand down his face. \u201cThey can\u2019t stay with us, understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re only welcome until the baby\u2019s born.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cYou\u2019re going to tell them that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight I am. I don\u2019t want them anywhere near me. This isn\u2019t for me, Maryellen. The only reason I\u2019m doing it is for you, and for our daughter and our baby.\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed down Maryellen\u2019s cheeks. She hated being this emotional. \u201cCall them if you want,\u201d she managed to say between sobs. \u201cOnly don\u2019t be upset with me. I can\u2019t bear it if you\u2019re angry. I just can\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>Jon came back downstairs and was immediately at her side. He gathered her in his arms and let his shoulder absorb her tears. \u201cI\u2019m not mad at you,\u201d he whispered into her hair. \u201cI\u2019m furious with myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly because I can\u2019t be the man you need me to be. You think I should forgive them for what they did. Hard as I try, Maryellen, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her arms went around him and they clung to each other. Somehow, they\u2019d get through this time, with or without his parents\u2019 help.</p><p>Roy McAfee stood in front of the charred rubble that had once been The Lighthouse restaurant. It made him sick to his stomach. His son stood on one side and Gloria on the other.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Davis told me the arson investigator says the fire was deliberately set,\u201d Gloria said, hands on her hips as she surveyed the damage. Slowly she shook her head, as if it was difficult to take in the scene before her. Roy felt the same way.</p><p>Arson. Roy hated to hear that. This wasn\u2019t the sort of thing you expected to find in a quiet community like Cedar Cove. The article in The Chronicle reported that the Gundersons were in shock and that no decisions had been made yet. They didn\u2019t know at this point whether or not they were going to rebuild.</p><p>\u201cIs there a suspect?\u201d Roy asked his daughter.</p><p>Gloria nodded. \u201cA person of interest\u2014a high school boy. He started a fire a few months back and was recently let go from the restaurant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shed in the park?\u201d Roy remembered reading about that, but the boy\u2019s name had been kept out of the paper.</p><p>Gloria nodded again.</p><p>\u201cDoes he have a motive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSheriff Davis seems to think so. The money box is missing, too.\u201d</p><p>Roy tried to remember what he\u2019d heard about the toolshed fire. \u201cWhat does the kid have to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a runaway,\u201d Gloria informed him.</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Mack said, \u201cdidn\u2019t you have a teenager visit the office last Monday?\u201d</p><p>Roy nodded. His son had connected the dots even before he had. \u201cThe Coxes\u2019 daughter wanted to hire me,\u201d he murmured thoughtfully, \u201cto find her boyfriend.\u201d The high school girl had been saving for a vehicle, but was willing to lay down every penny if Roy could locate the missing boy. Roy had been touched by her devotion\u2014but not once had she mentioned that this boyfriend was in a heap of trouble. Well, she should save her money. The law had far better resources than he did. If she insisted on spending her money, he\u2019d suggest a good attorney.</p><p>\u201cThe kid\u2019s name was Anson Butler,\u201d he said.</p><p>That got Gloria\u2019s attention fast. \u201cButler came in to see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, his girlfriend. He\u2019s the one who\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>She held his look. \u201cHe\u2019s also the one who\u2019s wanted for questioning about the fire.\u201d</p><p>Raising his eyebrows, Mack kicked at the ashes. \u201cI suppose now\u2019s as good a time as any to let you know I\u2019ve been a volunteer with the Kent Fire Department for the last couple of years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d It was Gloria who showed the most interest.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Mack said with a careless shrug. \u201cI enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear the Cedar Cove fire department has two paid openings,\u201d Gloria said. \u201cYou might want to apply.\u201d</p><p>Mack looked at Roy, as if seeking his approval.</p><p>Roy nodded solemnly. \u201cI wish you would.\u201d</p><p>His son grinned. \u201cIn that case, I will.\u201d</p><p>Roy squatted down and picked up a handful of ashes. He had his family with him now. Gloria, the daughter he\u2019d never known, and Mack, his formerly estranged son. Linnette had already moved to Cedar Cove and if Mack got a job with the fire department, he\u2019d be living here, too.</p><p>He let the ashes run through his fingers and wondered if Anson knew that Allison was prepared to give up everything she owned in order to find him. He hoped that, one day, the kid appreciated what she\u2019d been willing to sacrifice on his behalf. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Straightening, Roy looked over the scene one last time.
