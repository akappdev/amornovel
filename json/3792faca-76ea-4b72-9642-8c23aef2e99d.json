With steel weapons strapped to their chests and burnished armor glistening like shards of glass in the midday sun, they marched in pairs for as far as the eye could see. They did not ask permission nor care that they trespassed. Nay, they were on a quest, and nothing would get in their way. Crossing our fair land, they took our horses and our food, trampled our crops, used our women, and killed many of our fine men. They left destruction in their wake...all in the name of God.</p><p>They called themselves Crusaders. They fervently believed that their mission was holy and good because they had been told so by the pope, who blessed them and commanded them to journey to the other side of the world. They were to vanquish the infidels and force them to embrace their God and their religion. If the heathens refused, the soldiers were to kill them with their holy and blessed swords.</p><p>The pass through our mountains was the only route that would take the Crusaders forward on their quest, so they marched across it in legions, and once they reached the harbor on the other side of the mountains, they stole our ships to sail across the sea toward their destination.</p> <p>Our small country was then called Monchanceux. We were ruled by our uncle, the benevolent King Grenier. He was a man who loved his homeland and wanted to protect it. We were not a rich country, but we were content. We had enough. When the invading horde stole from us, our king was enraged, but he did not allow anger to guide his hand. Because he was such a clever ruler, King Grenier came upon a solution.</p><p>He would make the next group of invaders pay a toll to cross over the mountain. Since the pass was so narrow, it could easily be defended. Our soldiers were conditioned to the cold and the snow and the bitter night winds. They could protect the ridge for months at a time, and winter fast approached.</p><p>The leader of these righteous invaders was outraged at the notion of paying for anything. He and his men were on a holy mission. He threatened to kill every soul in Monchanceux, including women and children, if he and his men were denied passage. Were King Grenier and his subjects in the good graces of the church, or were they heathens standing in the way of the Lord\u2019s work? The answer would determine their fate.</p><p>It was at that very moment that our good and wise king embraced religion. He told the leader of the army that he and all his subjects were just as holy, and he would prove it beyond any doubt.</p><p>He called forth the people of Monchanceux and addressed them from the balcony of the palace. The leader of the crusading army stood behind him.</p> <p>\u201cFrom this day forward our country will be called St. Biel in honor of my family\u2019s patron saint. He is the protector of the innocent,\u201d King Grenier announced. \u201cWe will build statues of St. Biel and paint his image on the doors to our cathedral so that anyone who comes to our shores will know of his goodness, and we will send tribute to the pope to show our sincerity and our humility. The toll I collect will pay for this tribute.\u201d</p><p>The leader of the traveling throng found himself in a predicament. If he refused to pay the toll\u2014in gold, of course, for the king would accept nothing less\u2014then wouldn\u2019t he be refusing to allow the king to give tribute to the pope? And if the pope got wind that the Crusader had refused, what would the pontiff do? Excommunicate him? Execute him?</p><p>After a long night of contemplation and a good deal of ranting and raving, the military leader decided to pay the toll. It was a momentous occasion, for a precedent was set, and from that moment on, every Crusader desiring passage through our lands paid the toll without question.</p><p>Our king was true to his word. He had the gold melted down and made into coins, and upon each one was the image of St. Biel, a halo above his head.</p><p>The royal treasury had to be expanded to make room for all the gold coins, and a ship was prepared for the voyage to deliver the offering to the Holy Father. One day huge, heavy crates were loaded into the ship\u2019s cargo hold, and a crowd of citizens gathered at the harbor to watch the vessel depart for Rome. Shortly after that historic day, rumors began to spread. No one could verify that he had actually seen the gold or could estimate how much was sent. Several ambassadors claimed that only a pittance reached the pope. The talk of our king\u2019s vast fortune swelled and then receded like the tide lapping at our shores.</p><p>Eventually a quicker route to the Holy Land was discovered, and the Crusaders no longer tramped through our country. We were grateful for the solitude.</p> <p>We were not, however, left in peace. Every few years someone arrived looking for the now-legendary gold. A baron from England came, for his king had heard the rumor, but after our ruler allowed him to make a thorough search of the palace and the grounds, the baron told him that he would return to England with the news: there was no treasure to be found. Because King Grenier had been so hospitable, the baron warned him that Prince John of England was considering invading St. Biel. John, the baron explained, wanted to rule the world and was impatiently waiting to take over England\u2019s crown. The baron had no doubt that St. Biel would soon become yet another possession of England.</p><p>The invasion came one year later. Once St. Biel officially belonged to England, the search for the hidden gold resumed. Witnesses swore there was no rock left unturned.</p><p>If there had ever been a treasure, it had vanished.</p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>WELLINGSHIRE, ENGLAND</p><p>P RINCESS GABRIELLE WAS BARELY SIX YEARS OLD WHEN SHE was summoned to her mother\u2019s deathbed. Escorting her was her faithful guard, two soldiers on either side, their gait slow so she could keep up with them as they solemnly made their way down the long corridor. The only sound was their boots clicking against the cold stone floor.</p><p>Gabrielle had been called to her mother\u2019s deathbed so many times she\u2019d lost count.</p><p>As she walked, she kept her head bowed, staring intently at the shiny rock she\u2019d found. Mother was going to love it. It was black with a tiny white streak zigzagging all around it. One side was as smooth as her mother\u2019s hand when she stroked the side of Gabrielle\u2019s face. The rock\u2019s other side was as rough as her papa\u2019s whiskers.</p> <p>Every day at sunset Gabrielle brought her mother a different treasure. Two days ago she\u2019d captured a butterfly. It had such pretty wings, gold with purple splotches. Mother declared it was the most beautiful butterfly she\u2019d ever seen. She praised Gabrielle for being so gentle with one of God\u2019s creatures as she walked to the window and let it fly away.</p><p>Yesterday Gabrielle had gathered flowers from the hill outside the castle walls. The scent of heather and honey had surrounded her, and she thought the lovely aroma even more pleasing than her mother\u2019s special oils and perfumes. Gabrielle had tied a pretty ribbon around the stems and tried to fashion a nice bow, but she didn\u2019t know how and she\u2019d made a mess of it. The ribbon had come undone before she handed the bouquet to her mother.</p><p>Rocks were Mother\u2019s favorite treasures. She kept a basketful that Gabrielle had collected for her on a table next to her bed, and she would love this rock most of all.</p><p>Gabrielle wasn\u2019t worried about today\u2019s visit. Her mother had promised that she wouldn\u2019t go away to heaven any time soon, and she never broke her promises.</p><p>The sun cast shadows along the stone walls and floor. If Gabrielle hadn\u2019t been on an errand with her rock, she would have liked to chase the shadows and try to capture one. The long corridor was one of her favorite places to play. She loved to hop on one foot from one stone to another and see how far she could get before falling. She hadn\u2019t made it to the second arched window yet, and there were five more windows to go.</p><p>Sometimes she closed her eyes, stretched her arms out wide, and spun and spun until she lost her balance and tumbled to the floor, so dizzy the walls seemed to fly about her head.</p><p>Most of all, she loved to run down the corridor, especially when her father was home. He was such a big, grand man, taller than any of the pillars in the church. Her papa would call to her and wait until she reached him. Then he scooped her up into his arms and lifted her high above his head. If they were in the courtyard, she raised her hands to the sky, certain she could almost touch a cloud. Papa always pretended to lose his grip so that she would think he was about to drop her. She knew he never would, but she squealed with delight over the possibility. She wrapped her arms around his neck and held tight as he strode toward her mother\u2019s rooms. When he was in an especially happy mood he would sing. Papa had a terrible singing voice, and sometimes Gabrielle giggled and covered her ears it was so awful, but she never really laughed. She didn\u2019t want to hurt his tender feelings.</p><p>Papa wasn\u2019t at home today. He had left Wellingshire to visit his uncle Morgan in northern England, and he wouldn\u2019t be home for several days. Gabrielle wasn\u2019t concerned. Mother wouldn\u2019t die without him by her side.</p><p>Stephen, the leader of the guards, opened the door to her mother\u2019s chamber and coaxed Gabrielle to enter by giving her a gentle little nudge between her shoulder blades. \u201cGo on, Princess,\u201d he urged.</p><p>She turned around with a disgruntled frown. \u201cPapa says you\u2019re to call my mama Princess Genevieve, and you\u2019re supposed to call me Lady Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere in England, you are Lady Gabrielle,\u201d He tapped the crest emblazoned on his tunic, \u201cBut in St. Biel, you are our princess. Now go, your mother is waiting.\u201d</p><p>Seeing Gabrielle, her mother called out. Her voice was weak, and she looked terribly pale. For as long as Gabrielle could remember, her mother had stayed in bed. Her legs had forgotten how to walk, she\u2019d explained to Gabrielle, but she was hopeful, praying that they would one day remember. If that miracle were to happen, she promised Gabrielle that she would stand barefoot in the clear stream to gather stones with her daughter.</p><p>And she would dance with Papa, too.</p><p>The chamber was crowded with people. They made a narrow path for her. The priest, Father Gartner, was chanting his prayer in a low whisper near the alcove, and the royal physician, who always frowned and liked to make her mother bleed with his black, slimy bugs, was also in attendance. Gabrielle was thankful he hadn\u2019t put any bugs on her mother\u2019s arms today.</p><p>The maids, the stewards, and the housekeeper hovered beside the bed. Mother put down her tapestry and needle, shooed the servants away, and motioned to Gabrielle.</p><p>\u201cCome and sit with me,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>Gabrielle ran across the room, climbed up onto the platform, and thrust the rock at her mother.</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she whispered as she took the rock and carefully examined it. \u201cThis is the best one yet,\u201d she added with a nod.</p><p>\u201cMother, you say that every time I bring you a rock. It\u2019s always the best one.\u201d</p><p>Her mother patted a spot next to her. Gabrielle scooted closer and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t die today. Remember? You promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPapa will be awful angry, too, so you better not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLean closer, Gabrielle,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI have need to whisper.\u201d</p><p>The sparkle in her eyes told Gabrielle she was playing her game again.</p><p>\u201cA secret? Are you going to tell me a secret?\u201d</p><p>The crowd moved forward. All were eager to hear what she would say.</p><p>Gabrielle looked around the room. \u201cMother, why are all these people here? Why?\u201d</p><p>Her mother kissed her cheek. \u201cThey think that I know where a great treasure is hidden, and they hope that I will tell you where it is.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle giggled. She liked this game. \u201cAre you going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cNot today,\u201d Gabrielle repeated so that the curious onlookers would hear.</p><p>Her mother struggled to sit up. The housekeeper rushed forward to place pillows behind her back. A moment later the physician announced that her color was improving.</p><p>\u201cI am feeling much better,\u201d she said. \u201cLeave us now,\u201d she ordered, her voice growing stronger with each word. \u201cI would like a moment alone with my daughter.\u201d</p><p>The physician looked as though he wanted to protest, but he kept silent as he ushered the group from the chamber. He motioned for two maids to stay behind. The women waited by the door to do their mistress\u2019s bidding.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling so much better you can tell me a story today?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d she replied. \u201cWhich story would you like to hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe princess story,\u201d she eagerly answered.</p><p>Her mother wasn\u2019t surprised. Gabrielle always asked for the same story.</p><p>\u201cThere once was a princess who lived in a faraway land called St. Biel,\u201d her mother began. \u201cHer home was a magnificent white castle high on the top of a mountain. Her uncle was the king. He was very kind to the princess, and she was very happy.\u201d</p><p>When her mother paused, Gabrielle blurted impatiently, \u201cYou\u2019re the princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, you know that I am and that this story is about your father and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I like to hear you tell it.\u201d</p><p>Her mother continued. \u201cWhen the princess was of age, a bargain was struck with Baron Geoffrey of Wellingshire. The princess was to marry the baron and live with him in England.\u201d</p><p>Because she knew that her daughter loved to hear about the wedding ceremony, the gowns, and the music, she went into great detail. The little girl clapped her hands with delight when she heard about the banquet feast, especially the description of the fruit tarts and honey cakes. By the end of the story, the mother\u2019s narrative had become slow and labored. Exhaustion was catching up with her. The little girl took notice and, as was her ritual, she again made her mother promise she wouldn\u2019t die today.</p><p>\u201cI promise. Now it is your turn to tell me the story I taught you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery word just like you taught me, Mother? And just like your mother taught you?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cEvery word. And you will remember it and tell your daughters one day so they will know of their family and St. Biel.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle grew solemn and closed her eyes to concentrate. She knew she must not forget a word of the story. This was her heritage, and her mother assured her that one day she would understand what that meant. She folded her hands in her lap and then opened her eyes again. Focusing on her mother\u2019s encouraging smile, she began.</p><p>\u201cOnce upon a time in the year of the violent storms that tore in from the sea...\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>E VERYONE WHO WAS ANYONE IN ENGLAND KNEW ABOUT THE feud. Baron Coswold of Axholm, one of King John\u2019s closest advisers, and Baron Percy of Werke, also called friend and confidant by the king, had spent the last ten years trying to destroy each other. The competition between the two men was fierce. Each wanted more wealth than the other, more power, more prestige, and certainly more favoritism from the king. They fought bitterly over everything, and they coveted one prize most of all: Princess Gabrielle. At the mere mention of her name they became as rabid as mad dogs. Both barons were determined to marry this prized beauty. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The king was amused by their fits of jealousy. At every opportunity, he pitted one against the other. In his mind, they were his pets who would do any trick he requested just to please him. He knew about their obsession with Baron Geoffrey\u2019s daughter, Gabrielle, but he had no intention of giving her to either. She was far too valuable. He preferred, instead, whenever it suited his needs, to dangle the possibility that each man might still have a chance to win her hand in marriage.</p><p>Everyone who was anyone in England knew who Gabrielle was. Her beauty was legendary. She had grown up in Wellingshire not far from the king\u2019s palace. Her life there was quiet and relatively secluded until she came of age and was presented to the court. With her protective father, Baron Geoffrey of Wellingshire, at her side, she had endured an audience with King John that lasted no more than ten minutes at the most, yet that was all it took for the king to become completely enchanted.</p><p>John was in the habit of taking what he wanted when he wanted it. His reputation for lechery was well known. It wasn\u2019t unusual for him to seduce the willing\u2014and the unwilling\u2014wives and daughters of his barons, and then, the morning after, boast of his conquest. However, he didn\u2019t touch Gabrielle, for her father was one of the most powerful and influential barons in England.</p><p>John had enough conflicts on his hands. He didn\u2019t need another. He was being assaulted from all sides, and he believed that none of the conflicts were of his doing. His problems with Pope Innocent III had recently increased tenfold. Because John refused to accept the pope\u2019s choice of Stephen Langton as archbishop of Canterbury, the pope had placed an interdict on England. All church services were banned except for baptisms and confessions, and since bishops and priests had fled their churches to get away from John\u2019s wrath, finding one to perform either of those two sacraments was nearly impossible.</p> <p>The interdict infuriated King John, and he had responded by confiscating all church property.</p><p>The pope\u2019s reaction was severe. He excommunicated John, thereby undermining his ability to rule his country. Not only did the excommunication damn John\u2019s already black soul to the eternal fires of Hell, but it also absolved his subjects from their oaths of allegiance. In effect, the barons no longer had to be loyal.</p><p>Through reliable sources John knew that the king of France had his eye on the English throne and was being urged by some of the traitorous barons to prepare an invasion. While King John believed he had the men and the resources to meet this threat, it was still an expensive undertaking and one that would require his full attention.</p><p>There were minor problems plaguing him as well. The out-bursts in Wales and in Scotland were becoming more and more organized. King William of Scotland wasn\u2019t a problem. He had already pledged his fealty to John. Nay, it was the Highlanders who were out for blood. Though King William believed he had them under his control, the chieftains didn\u2019t much care about answering to anyone but their own clansmen. The farther north one traveled, the more violent and ruthless the clans became. There were so many feuds going on it was impossible to keep track of them all.</p><p>There was only one laird in the northern Highlands who wasn\u2019t a threat to the others and who actually garnered a bit of respect: Laird Alan Monroe. He was an older man, soft-spoken, with an easy disposition, traits that were unheard of in a Highland chieftain. He was content with his life and didn\u2019t have any designs to increase his holdings. Perhaps that was why he was somewhat liked.</p> <p>In a surprising attempt to appease some of his more influential barons, and taking to heart a suggestion from Scotland\u2019s King William, King John ordered a marriage between Lady Gabrielle and Laird Monroe. Though he had no need to, he sweetened her dowry with a large piece of land in the Highlands called Finney\u2019s Flat, which he had acquired years ago. Laird Monroe\u2019s home was at the southeast corner of this coveted property.</p><p>John\u2019s worries about a gathering army from the Highlands with many of the border lairds wishing to join in, all bent on attacking England, would be put to rest for the time being, and King William would no longer have to worry about a possible insurrection. Already restless and sympathetic to their northern neighbors, there was a fear that some of the lowlanders would add to the rebellion.</p><p>When the proposition to marry Gabrielle was put to Laird Monroe, he eagerly agreed. He also believed that with John\u2019s royal edict the fight among the lairds for control of Finney\u2019s Flat would end, and there would be peace in the area.</p><p>Only two would raise their voices against the marriage, Percy and Coswold, but John would ignore the pathetic pleas and protests by the two barons.</p><p>Gabrielle\u2019s father, Baron Geoffrey, was also in favor of the marriage. As much as he would have liked for his daughter to marry a proper English baron and live in England where he would occasionally see her, and his future grandchildren as well, he knew that Gabrielle wouldn\u2019t be safe as long as John was king. Baron Geoffrey had seen the lust in the king\u2019s eyes as he watched Gabrielle. He\u2019d acted very much like a spider patiently waiting to ensnare and devour his prey. And from what Geoffrey had heard from his distant relatives in Scotland, the Buchanans, Gabrielle\u2019s intended was a good man who would treat her kindly. This was high praise indeed for Laird Monroe, as the Buchanans didn\u2019t much like anyone outside of their own clan. Baron Geoffrey and Laird Buchanan were related by marriage, but the laird could barely tolerate Gabrielle\u2019s father, though ironically, Laird Buchanan, who hated all things English, had married an English lady.</p><p>With King John\u2019s blessing and Baron Geoffrey\u2019s approval, the wedding was scheduled. The only person who didn\u2019t have a say in the matter and the last one to hear about the upcoming ceremony was Princess Gabrielle.</p> <p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>T HE DAY BEFORE BARON COSWOLD WAS SCHEDULED TO leave St. Biel, he became a believer.</p><p>King John had sent him on this fool\u2019s errand, and Coswold was determined to get the task done as quickly as possible, for the king had finally promised him that, when he returned to England, Gabrielle would be his. And while Gabrielle\u2019s father despised Coswold, the king had assured him that he wouldn\u2019t have any trouble forcing Baron Geoffrey to accept the marriage.</p><p>Coswold also knew that the king had sent his rival, Baron Percy, on an errand into the northern wilderness to meet with Scotland\u2019s King William. His duties would take some time, and Coswold hoped to get back to England and quickly marry Gabrielle before Percy found out about it.</p><p>Coswold\u2019s orders were specific. He was to check on and verify that the steward King John had placed in charge of St. Biel, a whiny little man named Emerly, wasn\u2019t stealing from him.</p><p>John had invaded the country several years ago, and in the fierce battle for possession had nearly destroyed it. As soon as St. Biel was under his control, he set about looting the palace and the churches. If there was anything of value left, John wanted to know about it. The king didn\u2019t trust anyone, even the man he had personally chosen to oversee the country that now belonged to the crown.</p><p>The king was still intrigued by the rumors of hidden gold, though when pressed, he admitted he thought they were all nonsense; still, on the off chance there was a fragment of truth in them, he wanted Coswold to investigate. John didn\u2019t have faith in Emerly\u2019s report.</p><p>When Emerly had first arrived at the port of St. Biel, he had dragged forth each man and woman over the age of twenty who might have heard something about hidden treasure. Every single one admitted to having heard the rumors, and all of them thought the treasure probably had existed. Some thought the gold had gone to the pope, others that King John had stolen it. Nothing was conclusive, and after his own inquiry, Coswold\u2019s findings were no different.</p> <p>It was late afternoon, and there was a decided chill in the air as Coswold strolled across St. Biel\u2019s palace grounds to stretch his legs. The path led down a gentle slope to the harbor, and he could see his men moving his possessions onto the ship that would take him back to England. Before nightfall he would be in his cabin awaiting the tide.</p><p>Coswold wrapped his heavy cloak tighter around his shoulders and pulled the hood over his ears. He couldn\u2019t wait to be away from this godforsaken place.</p><p>He was walking past one of the thatched cottages when he spotted an old man carrying branches in his arms, no doubt for tonight\u2019s fire.</p><p>The stranger noticed the shivering Coswold and said, \u201cOnly men without blood would think this mild weather be cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are impertinent,\u201d Coswold snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t you know who I am?\u201d Evidently the man was unaware that Coswold wielded the power of King John, and with just one word could end his life. \u201cEven the steward, Emerly, would do well to fear me,\u201d Coswold boasted.</p><p>The old man looked unimpressed. \u201c\u2019Tis the truth, I don\u2019t know you,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut I\u2019ve been near the top of the mountain tending to the ill. I\u2019ve only just returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a physician?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, I\u2019m a priest. I look after the souls here, and I\u2019m one of the few priests left in St. Biel. My name is Father Alphonse.\u201d</p><p>The baron cocked his head and studied the priest\u2019s face. His skin had been ravaged by age and climate, but his eyes shone like those of a young man.</p><p>Coswold walked over to face the man, blocking his way. \u201cAs a priest you cannot tell a lie, can you?\u201d</p><p>If the clergyman thought the question peculiar, he didn\u2019t let on. \u201cNo, I certainly cannot. It is a sin to lie.\u201d</p><p>Coswold nodded, pleased with the answer. \u201cPut those branches down and walk with me. I have questions to put to you.\u201d</p><p>The priest didn\u2019t argue. Dropping the branches by the door of the closest cottage, he clasped his hands behind his back and fell into step beside the baron.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been assigned to St. Biel?\u201d Coswold asked.</p><p>\u201cOh my, it\u2019s been so long now I can\u2019t recall the exact number of years. I am most content. St. Biel has become my home, and I would be sorry to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you were here during the upheaval?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you call English soldiers ripping our country apart, killing our beloved King Grenier II, and destroying the monarchy? \u2018An upheaval\u2019?\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>\u201cGuard your words and your manner with me, priest, and answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know King Grenier before he died?\u201d</p><p>Father Alphonse let his anger show. \u201cDon\u2019t you mean before he was killed?\u201d Before Coswold could respond, he said, \u201cYes, I knew him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever speak to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know Princess Genevieve?\u201d</p><p>The priest\u2019s expression softened. \u201cYes, I knew her. She was the king\u2019s niece...his younger brother\u2019s daughter. The people of St. Biel loved her so. They didn\u2019t like the English baron taking her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaron Geoffrey of Wellingshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wedding was here, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, it was, and everyone in St. Biel was invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know that Princess Genevieve had a daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone here knows. We are not so isolated. News travels here just as quickly as everywhere else. Her name is Gabrielle, and she is our royalty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKing John is your royalty,\u201d Coswold reminded him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you asking me all of these questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever you mind. Living here all this time you must have heard the rumors of hidden gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so that is what this is about,\u201d the priest muttered.</p><p>\u201cAnswer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard the rumor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any truth in it?\u201d</p><p>The holy man considered his answer carefully. \u201cI can tell you there once was a large sum of gold in the king\u2019s treasury.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this already. Your countrymen have told me of the heavy toll your king collected from those who traveled over your mountains, and they also told me about his homage to St. Biel and his offering to the pope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, St. Biel.\u201d The old man nodded. \u201cOur patron and our protector. We have a great love for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is apparent,\u201d Coswold answered mockingly. He swept his hand around in a wide gesture. \u201cLook at the place,\u201d he sneered in disgust. \u201cYour saint is everywhere. One cannot step foot on the soil of this wretched land without being followed by those prying eyes and that smug expression. If the pope were to hear that this country worships a saint, he would excommunicate all of you.\u201d</p><p>Father Alphonse slowly shook his head. \u201cWe don\u2019t worship any saint. We pray to God; we honor the pope, but we believe we owe St. Biel a great debt. He is our patron saint. He has watched over us through many adversities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then,\u201d he muttered. \u201cIn honor of your patron saint, was all the gold sent to the pope?\u201d</p><p>The priest didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d he demanded, \u201cdid you ever see the gold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver the years I\u2019ve seen several gold coins. Princess Genevieve had one.\u201d</p><p>He was deliberately being vague, but Coswold pressed on. \u201cDid you see the gold in the treasury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly once,\u201d Father Alphonse said.</p><p>\u201cWas this before or after the donation to the pope?\u201d</p><p>The priest paused for several seconds. \u201cIt has been so many years. My mind is not as clear as it once was.\u201d</p><p>Coswold\u2019s curiosity was piqued by the evasive response. \u201cYour mind is clear enough, old man. I demand in the name of John, your king, to tell me. When did you see the gold?\u201d</p><p>Father Alphonse didn\u2019t answer quickly enough. Coswold grabbed the neck of the priest\u2019s robe and yanked him forward.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me,\u201d he snarled, \u201cI swear you will not see another day in your beloved country, and I\u2019ll have every image of your holy saint destroyed and dumped into the sea.\u201d</p><p>Father Alphonse gasped for air. The look in Coswold\u2019s eyes told him that he would carry out his threat.</p><p>\u201cI saw the gold coins in the treasury after a donation had been sent to the pope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would hear the details,\u201d he said.</p><p>The priest sighed. \u201cI had only been here a short while when I was given an audience with King Grenier I. He was a kind and clever man. He showed me his palace and the grounds\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe showed you the treasury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I believe it was by accident. I don\u2019t think the king meant for me to see it. As we strolled down the hall conversing quite pleasantly, we passed the treasury. The doors were open and two men were stacking bags of gold on top of other bags. The gold coins filled the shelves and the floor with only a narrow path to the door. Neither the king nor I acknowledged what we had seen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd? Get on with it. Tell me more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime passed, and I was called to the king\u2019s bedside to administer the sacrament of the last rites, for he was dying. His son was by his side and had spent the last hours with him, receiving instructions for the care of his kingdom. Again, the treasury doors were open as I happened by on my way to the chapel. But now the room was empty. There wasn\u2019t any gold, not even one coin, anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much was hidden away?\u2019</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGuess,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cThere is speculation that there was enough to win a war. Gold is power. It can buy anything...even a kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo where is the gold now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It just...disappeared. Perhaps it was all sent to the pope.\u201d He backed away from Coswold and bowed. \u201cIf there aren\u2019t other questions, I would like to go home and rest these weary bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Coswold said. \u201cBut keep this conversation to yourself.\u201d</p> <p>The priest nodded his agreement and started back up the hill.</p><p>Coswold let out a scornful chuckle. How could a treasure so large just vanish with no one to account for it? He shouted after the old man, \u201cSo this stupid king of yours hid his gold away and told no one. He took his secret to his grave. How cunning was that?\u201d</p><p>Father Alphonse turned around, barely controlling his anger. \u201cWhy would you think he didn\u2019t tell anyone?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>B ARON COSWOLD WAS OUTRAGED. HE HAD ONLY JUST RETURNED from St. Biel when he was given the news by one of the king\u2019s messengers that Lady Gabrielle was to be married to Laird Monroe at Arbane Abbey in just three months\u2019 time. How could this be? The news stunned him. The royal messenger also had orders to give Coswold from King John, but the baron found it nearly impossible to concentrate. He asked the messenger several times to repeat himself.</p><p>The baron barely managed to control his anger until he returned home. Then he let loose. He was furious with the king for once again breaking his promise. He stormed into the great hall, picked up a pitcher and a bowl, and hurled both into the hearth.</p> <p>Isla, his sister\u2019s daughter, was there to greet him. She was a timid creature who had idolized Coswold and had hung on his every word since the day he\u2019d taken her in. Isla had witnessed several of her uncle\u2019s tantrums in the past and knew to cower in the corner of the hall until he was finished.</p><p>In his fury he forgot she was even in the room. He paced about, kicking and throwing anything in his path, acting like a spoiled child who wasn\u2019t getting his way. He swept a goblet and pitcher from the top of a chest and smirked with perverse satisfaction as it shattered against the wall.</p><p>\u201cI have no one to blame but myself,\u201d he ranted. \u201cI\u2019m the fool here for believing that lying son of a whore. Why did I think this time would be any different? When has the bastard pretender king ever told the truth? When?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Isla nervously tugged on her bliaut and took a timid step away from the wall. Dare she answer him? Did he even want her to? She nibbled on her lower lip while she thought about it. If she made a wrong decision, her uncle might turn his wrath on her. It had happened once before, and for nearly a month she\u2019d carried the bruises on her arms where he grabbed her and shook her. That memory helped her make up her mind. Isla remained silent until Coswold calmed down.</p><p>Ten minutes later he collapsed into a chair at the table and demanded wine. A servant rushed into the hall with a goblet and a pitcher to replace the ones he\u2019d broken. The goblet was filled to the rim with the bloodred liquid. Some of it sloshed over the side as she placed it on the table. She quickly wiped the spill with a cloth, bowed low, and backed away from the baron.</p><p>He took a long gulp, leaned back in his chair, and let out a loud sigh. \u201cThere are no honest men in England these days. None at all.\u201d</p><p>Spent now, he turned, noticed Isla, and called out to her. \u201cCome, sit with me. Tell me what news you have collected while I\u2019ve been away. What of Percy? What has that bastard been up to?\u201d</p><p>A plain woman, Isla was happy for the attention. She rushed to the table and took her seat at the opposite end facing her uncle.</p> <p>\u201cBaron Percy was sent to the Highlands just as you left for St. Biel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already knew that,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cIs he back yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, he is,\u201d she answered. \u201cBut I have heard from his squire that he is preparing to leave for Arbane Abbey within the next few weeks. He was most unhappy about Lady Gabrielle\u2019s coming marriage and was said to carry on something terrible. The squire told me he cried.\u201d</p><p>It was the first bit of good news he\u2019d heard since Coswold stepped off the miserable ship. He chuckled as he thought about Percy weeping like an old woman. \u201cHe truly did cry? Did anyone see him? Tell me more.\u201d</p><p>Isla was about to tell him that she had heard that Percy had kicked and screamed and thrown things when he had heard that the lady was to wed Laird Monroe, but then she realized Coswold had just finished doing the very same thing. He might not take kindly to the comparison.</p><p>\u201cHe vowed that he would marry her with or without the king\u2019s permission and with or without her father\u2019s permission.\u201d</p><p>Coswold snorted with laughter. \u201cHe has always had lofty dreams.\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head. \u201cI wish that he would lower his expectations of a wife.\u201d</p><p>He paid no attention to her remark. Coswold gulped down the rest of the wine from his goblet, used his sleeve to wipe the drips from his chin, then poured himself more. \u201cDid Percy tell anyone how he planned to accomplish such an amazing feat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean how he plans to marry Lady Gabrielle without gaining permission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Before he could chastise her for letting her mind wander and not paying attention, she blurted, \u201cNay, he didn\u2019t explain to anyone. The same squire told me that if the king does not attend the ceremony, then Baron Percy will represent him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo King John is planning to go to Arbane Abbey?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBut the baron doesn\u2019t believe the king will make it there in time, for His Highness told him he has many other commitments he must see to first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Percy\u2019s hoping John won\u2019t attend, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d He scowled as he asked the question.</p><p>Once again Isla nodded. \u201cPercy boasted that the king has given him full power to speak in his name and make decisions with his blessings as well.\u201d</p><p>Coswold\u2019s good mood was dampered by the news. \u201cBaron Percy can make any decision he wishes?\u201d he muttered. \u201cThis is true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is what I\u2019ve been told.\u201d Isla dropped her folded hands on the table and cried out, \u201cYou must marry Gabrielle, Uncle. For even though it is wrong, I have feelings for Baron Percy. You know this well. Do you not see how I suffer?\u201d</p><p>Coswold rubbed his jaw. \u201cHe flatters you, Isla, because he sees how a kind word will turn your head and win your loyalty.\u201d</p><p>Her hand flew to her heart. \u201cI shall always be loyal to you. When my father died, you took me in and made certain that all my needs were met. I love you, and I would never ever be disloyal to you.\u201d In a rush, she added, \u201cBut I know how much you want Lady Gabrielle, and if you were to marry her, then perhaps Baron Percy will look to me for a wife. I know that I\u2019m not as pretty as most, but if you are married, then I will also be related to her, won\u2019t I? And won\u2019t that count for something with Percy?\u201d</p><p>He hardly knew how to answer. He almost felt sorry for her, because she had such impossible dreams. Percy would never marry the likes of her. Coswold doubted that any man would give her the time of day, for she was most unattractive. Her skin was sallow and pockmarked, and her lips were but thin lines that seemed to disappear when she spoke. She had made Coswold a good servant and a companion now that she was grown, and he wouldn\u2019t be averse to keeping her in his home until he or she died. But if Isla longed for marriage, who could Coswold find to marry her? She didn\u2019t have much of a dowry unless he added to what her father had left her. He knew that if the dowry were large enough, she would have many suitors, but he was unwilling to give up any of what he had. Now that her parents were dead, Coswold was Isla\u2019s only family. When she realized her uncle wouldn\u2019t increase her dowry, she would get upset, of course, but it would pass, and she would eventually accept her lowly lot. She had nowhere else to go.</p><p>\u201cOne must always have hope,\u201d he muttered for lack of anything better to say. \u201cRemember, Percy and I are enemies. I don\u2019t think he will forget our animosity, especially if I should marry Gabrielle. It seems, however, that Laird Monroe will be winning that prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could change that,\u201d Isla said. \u201cYou\u2019re cunning and so clever. You could find a way to marry her. I\u2019ve been told she doesn\u2019t even know she\u2019s to marry the laird yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think perhaps you have false hope, but I won\u2019t discourage you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I should win Percy\u2019s heart, you would give him permission to wed me?\u201d she asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cI would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Uncle,\u201d she whispered. Content now that she had gained his promise, she remembered her manners. \u201cHow was your journey? Did it go well?\u201d</p><p>Coswold loosened the belt around his waist and, stretching his feet out in front of him, slouched back in his chair. \u201cSt. Biel is a miserable place. It\u2019s cold when it should be warm and burning hot when it should be cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you find the treasure for the king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it exist?\u201d</p><p>His answer was immediate. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>There was no point in telling her what he really thought. As besotted as she was with Percy, Isla could very well let anything he said slip out at the wrong moment. Love made women foolish.</p><p>Coswold wasn\u2019t telling anyone that he believed the treasure existed. He planned to find it and keep it all for himself. He certainly wasn\u2019t going to share a single gold coin with King John, who had lied to him for the last time. With such a vast fortune at his fingertips, Coswold could build an army and take whatever he wanted when he wanted it. Ah, the thought of such freedom made his head spin.</p><p>To achieve his dreams, he had to be practical. Gabrielle held the key to the whereabouts of the gold. He was certain the secret of the hidden treasure had been passed down from one generation to the next. If he couldn\u2019t have her, in order to glean the information from her, then he would make certain Gabrielle was given to someone he could manipulate. And he had the perfect man in mind.</p><p>\u201cIn a few days I must go on another long journey,\u201d Coswold remarked.</p><p>\u201cMust you go far?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAll the way to the Highlands.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cYou\u2019re going to Arbane Abbey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must first meet with King John to answer his questions about St. Biel. Fortunately, he\u2019s in the north now, and when we are finished with our meeting, I\u2019ll continue on to the Highlands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the abbey.\u201d She nodded as she made the statement.</p><p>\u201cI have another destination in mind, but when I\u2019m finished there, I will head to the abbey. I should arrive in plenty of time for the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Isla took a deep breath to summon her courage. \u201cI know it\u2019s wrong for me to ask for anything more, but is there a chance I might go with you? I would love to see the princess marry. I\u2019m certain it will be a grand ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Now she was lying to him. She wasn\u2019t interested in seeing Lady Gabrielle wed. Percy would be there, and she wanted to see him. Coswold was about to refuse her request, then changed his mind. His niece might be of help to him.</p><p>She lowered her head in dejection, accepting his refusal before he had even given it.</p><p>\u201cAye, you may come.\u201d</p><p>Her head snapped up. Overjoyed, tears immediately welled in her eyes. Soon she would see the love of her life, and perhaps she would find a way to make him love her. Anything was possible. And Isla would do anything to marry Baron Percy.</p><p>Anything.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>T HEY WERE GOING TO BURY THE MACHUGH\u2019S BROTHER IN the center of the battlefield, and to amuse themselves, they decided to bury him alive.</p><p>The field chosen for his execution was called Finney\u2019s Flat, hallowed ground for the MacKennas. The clan was now calling the valley Glen MacKenna, for so many of their own fine soldiers had been slaughtered there. When the last battle had ended, the ground was stained black with MacKenna blood.</p><p>Laird Colm MacHugh had been responsible for the carnage. The mighty chieftain and his fierce warriors had poured down the mountain like a cauldron of oil boiling over, their scalding fury destroying everything in their path. Their gleaming swords raised, their united battle cry vibrated the jagged rocks. To the MacKenna soldiers waiting below to do battle, it had been a terrifying sight.</p><p>MacHugh was the most spine-chilling sight of all. Until that day some of the MacKenna soldiers had refused to believe the laird actually existed, for the tales of his ruthlessness in battle and his feats of Herculean strength couldn\u2019t possibly be accurate...unless, as some of the whispered rumors alleged, the MacHugh was in fact more beast than man.</p><p>Some who had gotten a glimpse of him swore he was half lion, half man: his chiseled face, his golden hair similar in color to a lion\u2019s mane, and his ferocity in battle like that of an animal. Invisible one second, he pounced the next, methodically ripping his prey apart limb by limb.</p><p>Or so it was told.</p><p>The more enlightened warriors scoffed at such a fanciful notion. The MacHugh was but a shadow with supernatural power, they argued. He disappeared at will, but when his shadow approached, a poor soul could ward off death only by dropping to his knees and praying for mercy. The MacHugh was invincible, impossible to grasp or capture. The only warning that he was about to strike was the music that came before. Shadow music. His battle cry blended in perfect harmony with the whistle of his blade as his sword sliced through the air. When a soldier heard that sound, he was already dead.</p><p>Laird Owen MacKenna knew all too well that Colm MacHugh was flesh and bone. Twice in the past year MacKenna had stood in the same great hall with him and twenty other lairds. They had gathered for meetings at the request of Scotland\u2019s king. The mighty MacHugh hadn\u2019t directly spoken to him either time, but MacKenna felt the sting of his words just the same. When matters affecting their adjoining lands were brought forth, the king and the other lairds turned to MacHugh for direction, as though his land and his strength held more importance than MacKenna\u2019s. And always in contention was Finney\u2019s Flat. The valley ran adjacent to both the MacHugh and the MacKenna holdings. The land was fertile with nary a rock in sight, perfect for their sheep to graze and perhaps a bit of barley planting, but neither clan could claim it. It belonged to John, king of England, granted to him years earlier by the king of Scotland as a conciliatory gesture. Each time MacKenna tried to take a piece of the land for himself, MacHugh saw to it that he was pushed back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, MacKenna despised this man. With every breath he took, his hatred grew until it threatened to consume him. Not one day passed without at least one dark thought about the laird, and what was most galling for Owen was the knowledge that MacHugh wasted not one minute thinking about any of the MacKennas. They weren\u2019t even important enough to hate.</p><p>Owen recognized this sin of jealousy. Envy was eating him alive, and he felt powerless to do anything about it. He dreamed of destroying MacHugh, and though he wouldn\u2019t dare admit his sin to his confessor, he would gladly sell his soul to the devil to get what he wanted.</p><p>His list of wants was long. He wanted MacHugh\u2019s power. He wanted his allies: the Buchanans, the Maitlands, and the Sinclairs. He wanted his strength and his discipline. He wanted the fear the laird instilled in his enemies; he wanted the loyalty he commanded from his friends. He wanted his lands and everything else MacHugh controlled. Most of all, Owen craved revenge.</p><p>Today was the day he would finally rid himself of his jealousy. Today was the day he would get justice.</p> <p>And what a glorious day it was for an execution...or many executions if all went well and a large number of MacHughs were killed. Pity he couldn\u2019t watch, but he had to separate himself from the executioners so that when he was accused of the crime, he could protest his innocence and have holy witnesses at Arbane Abbey to vouch for his presence.</p><p>Owen had carefully thought out the plan and had handpicked the soldier who would oversee the burial.</p><p>\u201cTiming,\u201d he had explained, \u201cis most important. You must wait until you see Laird MacHugh up on the ridge overlooking the flat before you bury his brother. He\u2019ll know who it is, but he won\u2019t be able to stop it. Have no worries. His arrows cannot travel such a distance, and his steed cannot fly. By the time he reaches his fallen brother\u2019s side, it will be too late, and you and your good men, will have gone into hiding.</p><p>\u201cA contingent of soldiers will be waiting to the west behind the line of trees. As soon as MacHugh gets close enough, they\u2019ll circle and attack.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his hands with malicious glee as he added, \u201cIf all goes well, Laird Colm MacHugh and his brother Liam will both be in the ground before nightfall.\u201d</p> <p>The soldier Owen had placed in charge of the burial was a thick-shouldered, thick-headed man named Gordon. Owen had made him repeat his orders to make certain he fully appreciated the importance of timing the burial just right.</p><p>The warriors had little trouble capturing Liam MacHugh. They ambushed him just as he passed through a thick grove of trees. They beat him severely and removed his boots, tied a thick rope around his ankles, and dragged him behind his horse to the deep narrow hole they\u2019d dug in preparation.</p><p>While they nervously waited for MacHugh to reach the ridge and also waited for Liam to regain consciousness so he would know what was going to happen, six of the seven soldiers got into a discussion regarding the burial.</p><p>The discussion turned into an argument. Three soldiers wanted MacHugh\u2019s brother buried headfirst with only his feet above the ground. When his toes stopped wiggling, they would know for a certainty that he was dead. Three other soldiers were in favor of dropping him into the hole feetfirst. They wanted to hear him scream and beg for mercy until the last shovel of dirt was thrown across the top of his head.</p><p>\u201cHe might not wake up,\u201d a soldier argued. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of stuffing his head in first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t even give up a whimper while we were beating him. Why do you think he\u2019d start in screaming now?\u201d another asked.</p> <p>\u201cLook at the mist coming on. It\u2019s already covering the ground and creeping up my boots. You won\u2019t be able to see his head anyway if this muck gets any thicker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPull that hood off and toss some water on his face and he\u2019ll wake up,\u201d yet another suggested.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going in headfirst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeetfirst,\u201d a soldier shouted, shoving one of the men who had disagreed with him.</p><p>Gordon knew the argument would soon turn physical. He kept his eye on the top of the ridge and announced that he would be the deciding vote.</p><p>Liam MacHugh would go to his grave feetfirst.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>I T WASN\u2019T UNUSUAL FOR A BRIDE TO MEET HER GROOM FOR the first time at their wedding ceremony, but Gabrielle hoped to at least get a glimpse of the man before then. The only piece of information she had about Laird Monroe was that he was an older man. No one had told her how much older, though, and she was filled with trepidation. What if he turned out to be an ogre? Or so old he couldn\u2019t stand straight? Or had no teeth and could only eat mush? She knew that his age and appearance shouldn\u2019t be important to her, but what if his manners were atrocious? Or worse, what if he was cruel to those around him? Could she live with someone who mistreated the men and women who depended on him?</p> <p>Her mother had often told her that she worried too much, but wasn\u2019t the unknown always a worry? To Gabrielle it was. Oh, how she wished her mother were here to offer advice now. She would calm Gabrielle\u2019s fears. But her mother had died in the winter two years ago. While Gabrielle knew that she had been blessed to have her in her life for so many years, there were times when she physically ached to talk to her. Today was one of those times, for Gabrielle was on her way to her wedding.</p><p>Twenty soldiers along with staff and servants accompanied Gabrielle and her father to the Highlands of Scotland. Their destination was Arbane Abbey, where her wedding ceremony would take place in one week. Rooms would be provided at the abbey for the travel-weary group.</p><p>The procession up the mountain was slow and arduous. The closer they came to their destination, the more withdrawn Gabrielle became.</p><p>The trail was narrow and broken, but her father was able to ride by her side once they had rounded a sharp turn. Baron Geoffrey tried to think of a way to lighten her concerns about the future.</p><p>He motioned to the lush valley below. \u201cDo you notice how green everything is here, Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Father, I do,\u201d she replied without enthusiasm.</p><p>\u201cAnd do you notice how invigorating the brisk air is in the Highlands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d she said.</p><p>The good baron was determined to raise his daughter\u2019s spirits. \u201cThere are those Highlanders who believe that we are high enough to touch heaven. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like Gabrielle\u2019s father to be so fanciful. Her mother had been the fanciful one, full of dreams that she had passed on to her daughter. But her father wasn\u2019t a dreamer. He was a leader of men, a protector, and a terribly practical man.</p><p>\u201cI would think they were mistaken,\u201d she answered. \u201cWe aren\u2019t high enough to touch heaven here. Only in St. Biel would that be possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how would you know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d she answered.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Baron Geoffrey said with a melancholy smile. \u201cAnd what exactly did she tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe always said the same thing, that when she stood next to the statue of St. Biel that overlooks the harbor, she was as close to heaven as she could be on earth.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle\u2019s fingers brushed across the gold medallion she wore on a chain around her neck. It had been fashioned from a coin and bore the likeness of St. Biel. She\u2019d had it for as long as she could remember. Her mother had been buried with one just like it.</p><p>He noticed the gesture. \u201cI miss her, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut she will always be in our hearts.\u201d Then with a sigh he said, \u201cDo you notice how blue the sky is? As blue as your mother\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do notice,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I have also noticed how you have pointed out again and again how lovely this land is. Could you possibly have a motive?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cI want you to appreciate your surroundings, and I want you to be content here and content in your marriage as well, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to argue. Was contentment the ultimate to be wished for? Were passion and love and excitement only for dreams? Was it ever possible to have it all? She longed to pose these questions to her father, but she could not. She held her tongue. As they continued on, she made up her mind to be more practical, like her father. She was a grown woman, soon to become a wife. It was time for her to put her childish dreams away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try to be content,\u201d she promised.</p><p>Their pace was slowed once again because of the rocky incline. Her father saw the look on her face and the sadness in her eyes. \u201cDaughter,\u201d he said in exasperation, \u201cyou are not going to a funeral. It\u2019s your wedding. Try to be joyful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will try,\u201d she promised.</p><p>An hour later when the caravan stopped so that the horses could rest and they could stretch their legs, her father asked Gabrielle to walk with him.</p><p>Neither said a word until they stopped to rest beneath a clump of birch trees near a flowing brook.</p><p>\u201cI have met Laird Monroe and some of his family. He will be kind to you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to talk about her future husband, but her father seemed determined.</p><p>\u201cThen I shall be kind to him,\u201d she said.</p><p>The baron shook his head. \u201cYou are a willful daughter.\u201d</p><p>She turned to face him. \u201cFather, what is it you\u2019re finding so difficult to tell me?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYour life is going to change when you become a wife. You won\u2019t be equal in your marriage, and you must accept this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother was your equal, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThat she was,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut she was the exception.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I will be the exception, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn time perhaps you will,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry about your future husband. I have been assured that he will never raise a hand against you, and as you know, there are husbands who would be cruel to their wives.\u201d There was disgust in his voice when he added that fact.</p><p>\u201cFather, I think you\u2019re more concerned about this marriage than I am. Do you actually wonder what I would do if my husband, or any man for that matter, were to raise a hand against me?\u201d</p><p>Somewhat chagrined, he replied, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t wonder. I know exactly what you would do because I saw to your training.\u201d</p><p>Before she could interrupt, he continued, \u201cHowever, there will be changes when you marry. You\u2019ll no longer be free to do what you wish. You\u2019ll have to take your husband\u2019s feelings and needs into consideration. You have been self-reliant in many ways, but now you must learn restraint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you telling me I must give up my freedom?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. His daughter sounded appalled by the notion. \u201cOf a sort,\u201d he hedged.</p><p>\u201cOf a sort?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when you are married,\u201d Baron Geoffrey continued, \u201cyou will share your husband\u2019s bed and\u2014\u201d Too late he realized where he\u2019d taken the conversation. He stopped, then coughed to cover his embarrassment. What had he been thinking to bring up this topic? Talking about the marriage bed with his daughter was impossible for him. After a moment\u2019s consideration he decided that he would ask one of the older women to explain what would happen on her wedding night. He simply wasn\u2019t up to the task.</p><p>\u201cYou were saying?\u201d she prodded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re close to the abbey now,\u201d he stammered. \u201cJust an hour or so away I\u2019d wager, and just as close to Finney\u2019s Flat if we were to ride in the opposite direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s early in the day. There\u2019s time before dark for us to look at the flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten that I must pay my respects to Laird Buchanan?\u201d He nodded to the west. \u201cWhen we reach the next rise, I\u2019ll leave you. It will be going on darkness by the time I reach his home. You and the others will continue on to the abbey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould it be possible for my guard and me to go to the flat while the others continue on? I\u2019m certain it won\u2019t take us any time at all to catch up with them. I am most curious to see this dowry that King John has given me.\u201d</p><p>He considered her request a long minute before agreeing. \u201cAs long as you take all four guards with you, and as long as you carry your bow and arrows, and as long as you are cautious to a fault. And you must promise me that you will not let the time get away from you and that it will be an uneventful ride. Then I will allow it.\u201d</p><p>She held her smile. \u201cUneventful, Father?\u201d</p><p>Seeing the sparkle in her eyes, Baron Geoffrey was suddenly feeling quite in awe of his daughter. With her black hair and her violet blue eyes, so like her mother\u2019s, Gabrielle had grown into a beautiful and delightful young lady. His chest swelled with pride as he thought of her many accomplishments. She could read and write, speak four languages, and speak them well. Her mother had seen that Gabrielle was well-versed in the feminine pursuits, and he had seen that she was well-trained in more practical matters. She could sit her horse as well as any man, and she wasn\u2019t squeamish with her bow and arrows. Truth be told, she was more accurate with her targets than he was.</p><p>\u201cUneventful, Father?\u201d Gabrielle repeated, wondering why he was so distracted.</p><p>He shook himself out of his contemplations. \u201cYou know what I mean. Do not play the innocent with me. You\u2019re prone to mischief.\u201d</p><p>She protested. \u201cI cannot imagine why you would think\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted. \u201cPromise me it will be an uneventful ride and that there will be no mischief. I\u2019ll have your word on this, Daughter.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI promise. There will be no mischief, and it will be an uneventful afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Uncomfortable with showing affection, Baron Geoffrey awkwardly patted her on her shoulder and then headed back to the horses.</p><p>Gabrielle hurried to catch up. \u201cFather, you worry too much. I\u2019ll be careful as I have promised, so please quit your frown. Nothing\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Two hours later she had to kill a man.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>G ABRIELLE INTERRUPTED A MURDER.</p><p>She had wanted a bit of excitement to take her mind off her worries, but she most certainly hadn\u2019t wanted to witness anything this horrifying.</p><p>The ride began quite pleasantly, invigorating in fact. After she had dutifully kissed her father on his whiskered cheek and bid him a safe journey to the Buchanans to pay his respects, she forced herself to walk, not run, to her horse, Rogue. She even allowed the soldier Stephen to assist her into her saddle. Rogue pranced in anticipation, sensing that he would soon be allowed to soar into the wind.</p><p>Certain that Baron Geoffrey was watching, Gabrielle played the meek maiden and wouldn\u2019t allow Rogue to break into a gallop as was the spirited horse\u2019s custom. She forced him to start out at a much slower gait. She had the feeling that her father knew exactly what she was doing, and so she held her smile as she turned and waved to him one last time before she was out of sight. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she was free to do as she pleased, Gabrielle loosened the grip on the reins and gently nudged Rogue. The horse lunged into a full gallop, and by the time they reached the top of the nearest hill, Gabrielle felt as though she were flying. She laughed over the sheer joy she felt at that very moment. The burdens pressing down on her began to drift away.</p><p>As usual, Stephen took the lead. Christien and Lucien flanked her sides, and Faust, the youngest, rode last, protecting her back. The four soldiers could have been brothers, so alike in appearance were they with their white-blond hair, blue eyes, and deeply tanned, weathered skin. They dressed alike as well, in a soldier\u2019s uniform, all in black, but with a small, barely noticeable emblem of the royal house of St. Biel just above their hearts.</p><p>Their personalities were quite different, though. Perhaps because he was the oldest and the commander over the other three guards, Stephen was the most serious and rarely smiled. Christien spoke his mind more often and was the easiest to rile; Lucien had a wonderful sense of humor, and Faust was the quiet one.</p><p>All spoke in their native tongue. Like Gabrielle, they could understand and speak Gaelic, though they preferred not to.</p> <p>Gabrielle knew how fortunate she was to have the loyalty of these four men. They had been her protectors most of her life. They had shielded her when her adventurous nature took her into precarious situations, and had kept her secrets\u2014even from her father when she didn\u2019t want him to find out about some of her escapades. Her safety was always their primary objective, but she valued their confidence as well. On numerous occasions they had saved her from peril, even at the risk of their own lives.</p><p>Just last month Faust came to her defense at the village market. She was making her way among the stalls when two drunken men began to follow her, their smirks divulging their lascivious intentions. The minute they moved in her direction, Faust stepped in front of her and laid the men on the ground before they knew what happened.</p><p>She also recalled an incident that occurred last year. She was heading toward her father\u2019s stables to see the new foal that had been born. Just as she was rounding the corner of the stable, the hitch on the grain wagon at the top of the hill broke, sending the cart careening down at her with ferocious speed. She had barely turned to see it coming before Christien grabbed her shoulders and threw her out of its path, taking the impact of the wheel on his leg. His ankle was so bruised and swollen, he couldn\u2019t walk on it for weeks.</p><p>She cringed at the thought of the trouble she had caused these steadfast men, but then she smiled thinking about some of the other times they had been there to look after her. There were the nights when she was a little girl that Stephen kept watch so that she could sneak out of her chamber and listen to the musicians in the courtyard. She also remembered the afternoon that, despite her father\u2019s warnings, she and her friend Elizabeth climbed a willow tree by the river and fell into the muddy waters. Lucien had rushed the little girls to the cook to be washed and given clean clothes before Baron Geoffrey was ever the wiser. And she could never forget when she was nine years old and the band of ragged wanderers made camp in the meadow next to her father\u2019s castle. She had been cautioned to stay away from them, but she indignantly felt that all visitors were guests and should be treated as such. The cook had been baking berry tarts for the evening meal, and so Gabrielle waited until they were placed in the open window to cool and then gathered them in her skirts. She was happy to see the guests gobble down the treats with great relish, and she would have lingered to visit, and might even have accepted their invitation to ride with them for a while, had she not turned to see Christien and Lucien standing ten feet behind her with their arms crossed and scowls on their faces. When her maidservant questioned the unusual stains on Gabriel\u2019s skirt that night, the guards did not mention her disobedience, but later when they were alone with the little girl, they warned her about the harsh ways of the world.</p><p>Christien and Faust were the newest members of her guard, but Stephen and Lucien had been with her for as long as she could remember. Through all of the important, as well as the trivial, events of her life, one or more of them had been by her side. Even in her lowest moments, they were there. When her mother took a turn for the worse and Gabrielle was once again summoned to her bed, Gabriel knew in her heart that this would be her final visit. For two long, sad days, she and her father sat with the dying woman, holding her hand and stroking her brow. Many servants and physicians came and went during that time, but outside the chamber door, for every minute of those two days, all four of Gabrielle\u2019s guards stood watch. Not one would leave his post.</p> <p>As Gabrielle now rode with them toward Finney\u2019s Flat thinking of all that they had done for her, she said a prayer of thanksgiving for these dear friends.</p><p>Stephen pulled her attention from her thoughts when he veered to the east. Gabrielle followed. After the horses had a good run, she slowed the pace. The rugged landscape surrounding her was craggy and covered with a dazzling green blanket. There were spills of bright purple heather, white chickweed, and milkwort dripping down the hills. Her father had told her that all of Scotland was lovely, but Gabrielle, looking over the vast landscape, thought the Highlands were stunning.</p><p>The higher they rode, the colder the air became. The scent of pine was thick, and the cold wind felt wonderful against her face.</p><p>They had been climbing almost two hours when they suddenly reached the tip of a plateau. Stephen had already scouted the area and explained to Gabrielle that there was really only one way to get to their destination.</p><p>\u201cSince we\u2019re coming from the south, the direct route would be straight ahead, but as you can see, the way is thick with trees, and it might be difficult to get our horses through. We could probably manage it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if we can\u2019t manage it?\u201d Christien asked.</p> <p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll go another way,\u201d Lucien answered.</p><p>\u201cFinney\u2019s Flat is on the other side of those trees?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, Princess.\u201d</p><p>She blocked the sun from her eyes with her hand and looked to the east and then the west. The line of trees seemed to extend for as far as the eye could see. The plateau was massive.</p><p>\u201cHow deep are the trees?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t try to go all the way through,\u201d Stephen said. He glanced up at the sky to note the position of the sun and then said, \u201cWe have quite enough daylight to find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf the closeness of the trees is a concern, could we approach Finney\u2019s Flat from the east or the west? Would that be quicker?\u201d Lucien posed the question.</p><p>Christien answered. \u201cPrincess Gabrielle\u2019s father told us that there were woods on the east side of the flats, and beyond those woods is Loch Kaenich. There are also thick woods lining the west side of Finney\u2019s Flat, and beyond those woods live the wild Buchanans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWild Buchanans?\u201d Lucien was curious about Christien\u2019s description of the clan.</p><p>\u201cThat is what Baron Geoffrey calls them, and from some of the stories he\u2019s told, I don\u2019t think the name\u2019s an exaggeration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that none of the clans allow trespassers,\u201d Faust interjected.</p><p>Gabrielle frowned as she turned to look at the soft-spoken guard. \u201cFaust, we\u2019re on MacKenna land now, and no one has tried to stop us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, Princess,\u201d he answered. \u201cWe aren\u2019t on MacKenna land. \u2019Tis true that their holding does border Finney\u2019s Flat on the south, but we\u2019re on the southeast tip, and that little piece of land is controlled by Laird Monroe, your future husband. That is why we have been left alone.\u201d</p><p>She slowly scanned the horizon. The area looked completely deserted to her. Since they had begun their long journey across the Highlands, she hadn\u2019t seen another soul. Were the people who lived in this vast wilderness in hiding so they wouldn\u2019t have to interact with outsiders, or were they simply few and far between?</p><p>\u201cStephen, what if we were to try to cut through the east and approach Finney\u2019s Flat from the north side?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPrincess, do you not see the mountain straight north of us?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe Buchanan laird told your father that toward the bottom of the mountain there is a limey cliff with a wide stone overhang above Finney\u2019s Flat...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father, the baron, told us that the path winding down from the overhang is the only way to get to the bottom, and it is heavily guarded. If you squint against the sun, you can see it,\u201d Lucien explained.</p><p>\u201cThe mountain from the base of the trail to the land above is controlled by the clan MacHugh, and they do not suffer trespassers.\u201d Faust made this comment.</p><p>\u201cSuffer trespassers?\u201d She smiled as she repeated his words.</p><p>\u201cThey are...quick to rile,\u201d Christien said. \u201cAnd quick to react.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could not allow you to go there,\u201d Stephen said.</p><p>\u201cLaird MacHugh is a dangerous man,\u201d Faust said.</p><p>\u201cAye, we have heard the MacHugh clan is quite fierce, and their leader is a savage,\u201d Christien told her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI would not be so quick to judge a man because someone has spoken ill of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is your pleasure then, Princess?\u201d Stephen asked. \u201cHow would you have us proceed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll walk through the forest directly ahead of us,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the fastest route, is it not? And it will be good for us to stretch our legs.\u201d</p><p>Stephen bowed his head. \u201cAs you wish, Princess. I would suggest that we ride as far as we can into the woods so that our horses will be hidden from the curious who happen by. Faust, you will stay with the mounts when we are forced to walk.\u201d</p><p>As it happened, they were able to ride a fair distance into the woods, though there were a few tight squeezes through prickly brush. Twice they had to backtrack to find another way around, but once they had crossed a narrow creek, they were able to gather speed. When they reached the last crush of trees, they dismounted. Handing over the reins of her horse to Faust, Gabrielle followed Stephen who parted the brush ahead of them.</p><p>The clearing was only a few yards away when Stephen suddenly stopped and put his arm out to block Gabrielle from going any farther. She stood beside him, straining to hear the sounds of the forest. As she waited, she silently adjusted the strap holding her pouch of arrows over her shoulder and shifted her bow to her left hand in preparation. A few seconds later she heard a harsh bellow of laughter followed by a loud blasphemy.</p><p>She stayed perfectly still. She heard men talking, but their voices were muffled and it was impossible to understand the conversation.</p><p>Raising her hand to her guards so that she would get no argument, she slowly crept forward. She was well-hidden by the trees, but when she shifted ever so slightly to the left, she had an unobstructed view of the flat land beyond. She spied seven men, all dressed in monks\u2019 garb with their brown hoods pulled up over their heads.</p><p>For a moment she thought they were standing over one of their own, praying for his soul before they buried him. They were clustered together near what appeared to be a pit. Near the hole was a fresh mound of dirt. When their true intentions became clear, she nearly gasped. An eighth man was on the ground. He wasn\u2019t dressed as a monk but wore a muted plaid. His hands and feet were bound, and he was covered in blood.</p><p>Gabrielle moved closer. She felt Stephen\u2019s hand on her shoulder, but she shook her head and continued on. Still shielded by the trees, she watched and listened to the discussion under way.</p><p>The men were arguing over which way to drop the bound man into the hole. Three wanted him to go in headfirst. Others vehemently disagreed, wanting the captive tossed in feetfirst. The one who had been silent, most likely their leader, made the final decision.</p><p>All were in agreement on one issue: they wanted their captive to wake up so that he would know what they were about to do to him.</p><p>Gabrielle was sickened and appalled by the snippets of conversation the wind brought her. What sin was their captive guilty of? What was his transgression? She decided that it didn\u2019t matter what he had done, for no crime, no matter how heinous, deserved such a sadistic punishment. It was inhuman.</p><p>As she listened to their escalating argument, she discovered the truth. The only sin their captive was guilty of was one of association. He was Laird Colm MacHugh\u2019s brother.</p><p>The leader finally spoke. \u201cHamish, keep your eyes on that ledge. We can\u2019t put Liam MacHugh in the ground until we see his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGordon, I ain\u2019t deaf. You already told me what to do, and I\u2019m doing it. I got my eyes peeled on that ledge. I\u2019m still wanting to know what we\u2019re supposed to do if Laird MacHugh don\u2019t come to save his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be coming all right,\u201d one of the others answered. \u201cAnd when he makes the turn at the lookout, he\u2019ll see what\u2019s happening, but no matter how fast he rides, he won\u2019t get here in time. His brother will be long dead, and we\u2019ll be long gone back to the border.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how will he be able to tell it\u2019s his brother going in the ground?\u201d yet another asked.</p><p>Gordon answered. \u201cWord\u2019s reached him by now that his brother\u2019s in trouble. He won\u2019t be able to see his face from such a distance, but he\u2019ll recognize the plaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he don\u2019t recognize the plaid from so far away?\u201d Hamish asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll still see us dumping Liam into the hole and burying him. He\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he can\u2019t see his face, then he can\u2019t be seeing our faces, either. So how come we have to wear these robes? They\u2019re scratching my skin. I feel like I got bugs crawling on me. It smells, too, like pig swill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit your complaining, Kenneth,\u201d Gordon ordered. \u201cWe\u2019re wearing the robes we stole because we aren\u2019t going to take any chances MacHugh might see our faces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he ever finds out we did this...\u201d Hamish visibly shivered. \u201cHe\u2019ll do worse than bury us alive.\u201d</p><p>There was a grumble of agreement. \u201cMaybe we ought to just leave him and take off now,\u201d Kenneth said. He was nervously backing away from the hole.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk stupid,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cLaird MacHugh is never going to find out who we are. Why do you think we were brought up from the lowlands?\u201d He added in a rush before there could be another complaint, \u201cAnd paid handsomely. Are you willing to give that up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but\u2014\u201d Hamish began.</p><p>\u201cEnough talk of running away,\u201d he snapped. He turned to the soldier standing over the unconscious warrior and said, \u201cKick him, Roger. See if he stirs. I want him awake when he goes in the hole.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roger did as ordered, swiftly kicking him in his side. Liam didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to wake up this time,\u201d Kenneth said. \u201cI\u2019m guessing he\u2019s dying now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have beat him so hard, Gordon,\u201d Hamish muttered.</p><p>\u201cWe all took a turn,\u201d Roger reminded him.</p> <p>\u201cWe only did what we were told to do,\u201d another interjected.</p><p>Gordon nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. We were only following orders, like the good soldiers we are.\u201d</p><p>Kenneth pushed the hood on his robe back, scratching his ear. \u201cTell me again. What did Liam MacHugh do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you ten times already,\u201d Gordon shouted as he gave Kenneth a mighty shove, nearly knocking him into the hole.</p><p>The soldier scrambled to regain his balance. \u201cTell me again,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe caught Liam, and we\u2019re killing him to bring his brother down off the mountain so the soldiers hiding in the east woods can catch him unawares.\u201d</p><p>Kenneth scratched his ear again as though to remove a pesky bug. \u201cWhat are they gonna do with him when they catch him?\u201d</p><p>Gordon shook his head. \u201cKill him, you simpleton, and bury him next to his brother.\u201d</p><p>Kenneth wasn\u2019t offended by the name calling. \u201cWhat clan are the soldiers from? You know, the ones hiding over there.\u201d He waved his hand toward the east, squinting to see if he could spy any of them.</p><p>\u201cNever you mind what clan they belong to,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe less you know, the better for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook! Liam might be waking up,\u201d another soldier announced, nudging their captive with his foot.</p> <p>Roger cackled with delight. \u201cGood. He\u2019ll be knowing what\u2019s happening when we dump him into the hole. Have any more water to throw on his face, Manus? Get him good and awake.\u201d</p><p>Before he could get an answer, Kenneth said, \u201cHe never waked up. I\u2019ve been watching his face, and his eyes haven\u2019t even fluttered open once. He\u2019s as good as dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut maybe like Gordon said, if we threw water on his face...\u201d another soldier suggested.</p><p>\u201cI used up the last of it,\u201d Manus said. \u201cWe could spit on his face.\u201d</p><p>The men thought that was a fine idea and began to laugh. Gabrielle heard the last two names as they pushed and shoved one another, acting like they were at a festival. Fergus and Cuthbert. She knew it was important for her to remember all seven names, for one day there would be retribution.</p><p>Hamish\u2019s snorts of laughter stopped when he happened to look up and spot Laird MacHugh.</p><p>\u201cThere he is! There he is!\u201d Hamish shouted as he struggled to get his hood up over his head. \u201cThere\u2019s the MacHugh!\u201d</p><p>Everyone, including Gabrielle, looked to the ledge. A silhouette of a warrior on horseback moved like a golden blur against the sun.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got plenty of time,\u201d Kenneth said. \u201cThe MacHugh can\u2019t fly down here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at all the men following him. I\u2019m counting up to twenty already,\u201d Manus shouted, his voice trembling with fear.</p><p>Gordon was getting jumpy. He thought he\u2019d heard a noise behind him. He whirled around, his hand poised on the hilt of his sword. When he couldn\u2019t see a threat, he turned again to look to the east and then the west. Nothing.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve wasted enough time,\u201d he said. \u201cGet him in the hole. We\u2019ve got to cover him with dirt and be on our way.\u201d</p><p>Roger and Cuthbert rushed to Liam and hauled him to his feet. The captive\u2019s head dropped forward. Fergus grabbed him by his hair and jerked his head back. \u201cHis eyes are closed again,\u201d he said, obviously disappointed.</p><p>\u201cHis eyes were never open,\u201d Kenneth replied.</p><p>They were dragging Liam to the hole when a far-off rumble caught their attention. In unison all seven turned just as warriors on horseback broke through the trees at the far end of the glen. Their horses pounded the ground as they closed the distance. So far away, they were but dots on the horizon.</p><p>\u201cIt could be the Buchanans,\u201d Manus shouted. \u201cCan\u2019t see them good at all yet, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll kill us! They\u2019ll kill us all!\u201d Hamish screamed. He twirled in a circle like a cornered wood mouse trying to decide which way to scurry. \u201cWhere can we hide? Where?\u201d</p><p>Cuthbert and Manus dropped Liam\u2019s limp body. Urgency cracked Gordon\u2019s voice when he ordered, \u201cGet him up. Hurry, damn you. Get him up. When I was pulling him off his horse, his eyes opened, so I\u2019m the only one he\u2019s seen. I\u2019ve got to kill him before he goes into the hole. There isn\u2019t time to bury him and let him suffocate.\u201d</p><p>Cuthbert and Manus didn\u2019t obey the order. Neither did Roger or Kenneth or Hamish or Fergus, for all of them had already run for cover.</p><p>Gordon drew his sword. At the same time, Gabrielle reached for an arrow and notched it to her bow in anticipation.</p><p>The Buchanan warriors were still too far away for their arrows to reach the seven men, and the MacHugh warriors racing down the mountain were also too far away to save one of their own.</p><p>Suddenly, there was another commotion. Soldiers waiting to ambush the MacHugh broke through the trees and headed across the flats toward the Buchanans. A full-scale battle was about to erupt. If they didn\u2019t hurry, Gabrielle and her guards would soon find themselves in the thick of it.</p><p>Gabrielle kept her gaze locked on Gordon, the leader of this pack of rats. His captive wasn\u2019t moving. Liam was down on the ground, lying on his side, and Gordon kept nervously glancing to the north. He took a couple of steps back, hesitated, and then moved forward again. Gabrielle knew Gordon couldn\u2019t run away and leave Liam, who had seen his face.</p><p>\u201cStephen,\u201d she whispered. \u201cIf I miss\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I do...be ready.\u201d</p><p>Gordon made up his mind. Turning in her direction, he swung his sword back, his intent to slice Liam in half.</p><p>Gabrielle\u2019s arrow stopped him. Her aim was true, and the tip of the arrow cut through flesh and rib, piercing his black heart.</p><p>Seconds later the ground seemed to buckle beneath her feet as the Buchanans and their enemies clashed on the battlefield. The sound of metal slamming into metal was earsplitting. The killing had begun.</p><p>The pandemonium moved toward her. Gabrielle prayed that Liam MacHugh wouldn\u2019t be trampled by horses or men before she could get to him. Blessedly, Christien and Faust made quick time and arrived at her side with the horses. Gabrielle climbed onto Rogue\u2019s back and started toward the open field, pulling her cape over her head, hoping in the chaos that no one would see her.</p><p>Stephen blocked her. He knew what she wanted done. \u201cChristien and I will see to the task. Lucien and Faust will take you back to the stream we crossed. Hurry, Princess. You must get away from here.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t waste time arguing. She prodded Rogue with her foot and headed back through the forest. Moments later at the stream, Stephen and Christien caught up with them. Gabrielle thanked God they hadn\u2019t gotten trapped by the battle.</p><p>\u201cIs he alive?\u201d She dismounted and rushed to Stephen\u2019s side. Liam MacHugh was draped over his steed\u2019s saddle.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still breathing,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cHurry then. I know where we can get help.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>A NOTHER GRISLY BATTLE CRY RENT THE AIR. TORTURED screams followed.</p><p>The MacHughs had joined the fight. Forming an impenetrable line, they advanced. The Buchanans followed their lead, and within minutes the two clans had trapped the enemy between them. They showed no mercy. It was an eye for an eye, and when it was over, the field was littered with bodies.</p><p>The frantic search for Liam MacHugh began then. Colm MacHugh leapt from his horse and ran to the hole the enemies had prepared for his brother. His relief was great when he saw the hole was empty. There was only one body on the ground near the mound of dirt. Colm didn\u2019t recognize him. He was studying the unusual markings on the arrow embedded in the man\u2019s chest when Laird Brodick Buchanan joined him.</p><p>\u201cWho the hell is he?\u201d Colm asked.</p><p>Brodick shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him before.\u201d</p><p>Colm jerked the arrow from the dead man\u2019s chest. \u201cIs this a Buchanan arrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I thought it was yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacKenna\u2019s behind this,\u201d he said.</p><p>Brodick shook his head. \u201cThose aren\u2019t his soldiers on the ground, and this isn\u2019t one of their arrows. The markings...I\u2019ve never seen one like this before. There\u2019s no sign of MacKenna here.\u201d He picked up a piece of rope. There was blood on it. \u201cThey tied your brother with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still think this is somehow MacKenna\u2019s doing,\u201d Colm insisted.</p><p>\u201cWithout proof, you cannot accuse him,\u201d Brodick reasoned.</p><p>\u201cLiam couldn\u2019t have gotten far.\u201d Colm scanned the woods surrounding them. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep looking until we find him and whoever has him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Buchanans are with you,\u201d Brodick pledged. \u201cAs long as it takes to avenge this black-hearted deed.\u201d</p><p>The two lairds divided their men into smaller units to scour the area, but after hours of searching, each group reported that they had thoroughly covered the flats and the forests, but to no avail.</p><p>Liam MacHugh had vanished into thin air.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>L IAM MACHUGH WAS IN SORRY SHAPE. SOMEONE HAD TAKEN a whip to his back, and his skin had been shredded into bloody ribbons. His legs and the bottoms of his feet had also taken a beating, and blood dripped from the deep gash on the right side of his head.</p><p>Gabrielle knew she could get help for the warrior at Arbane Abbey, and though she was in a hurry to get there, the injured man\u2019s immediate needs came first.</p><p>They rode along the bank of the stream until they were far enough away from the fighting to stop. Stephen lifted the lifeless body of Liam MacHugh from his horse and placed him on the ground next to Gabrielle. She gently laid his head in her lap and pressed a cloth to the wound at his temple, trying to stop the bleeding, and then she quickly cleaned the other cuts as best she could with a strip of linen she\u2019d torn from her undergarment and dipped in cold water. The man needed medicine to ward off infection and a soothing salve for his back. He also needed someone to put a needle and thread to him to pull together the ragged edges of skin around the gash. She didn\u2019t want to be the one to sew him back together, for she didn\u2019t wish to cause him any more pain.</p><p>The turn of the stream was tucked in between the pines a fair distance away from Finney\u2019s Flat. They were isolated and she hoped safe from intruders. While Lucien and Faust guarded the area, Stephen and Christien stayed close to her. Just as she was about to call for her guards to move him, Liam\u2019s head wound started bleeding again.</p><p>\u201cPrincess, you\u2019ve got blood all over your gown,\u201d Stephen remarked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not bothered by it,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut I worry about this poor man. He\u2019s lost so much blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to make it,\u201d Christien said. \u201cAnd we should be prepared for that possibility. What would you have us do with the body?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle wasn\u2019t shocked by Christien\u2019s bluntness. He wasn\u2019t being callous. He was a compassionate man, but he was also the most pragmatic of the four guards.</p><p>\u201cIf he dies, then it is God\u2019s will, but I will do everything in my power to help him survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs will we,\u201d Stephen assured her. \u201cHowever, Christien has made a valid point. This MacHugh warrior has not seen you.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was gentle. \u201cHow could he? He has yet to open his eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand our meaning,\u201d Christien said. \u201cYou could be in great danger.\u201d</p><p>Stephen agreed. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who these people are or if any of them may have seen us. Your arrow killed the leader of the men at the grave, but the others got away. If they find out you\u2019re responsible for his death, they might seek revenge. No one must ever know you were there.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle glanced around at the somber faces of her four guards and realized Stephen was right. But it wasn\u2019t for her safety alone that she was concerned. If the men at Finney\u2019s Flat found out she had killed one of their own, they wouldn\u2019t just come after her; they would retaliate against her guards as well. She couldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you propose I do?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhen we get closer to Arbane Abbey, Lucien and Faust will accompany you inside and escort you to your quarters,\u201d Stephen suggested.</p><p>\u201cYou could use your cloak to hide the blood on your gown,\u201d Christien said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what of this injured man?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll find another way to get him into the abbey. The monks will surely have the medicine he needs.\u201d</p><p>Christien nodded. \u201cIf he dies, there is the possibility that Laird MacHugh might blame you. You heard what those cowards said about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey called him ruthless,\u201d she said. \u201cYet they were going to bury an innocent man alive. Why would I believe a word any of them said?\u201d</p><p>She stopped them before they could argue. \u201cThis man is now our responsibility. I won\u2019t hand him over to anyone. We will all find a way into the abbey that will not draw attention. Only when I am assured that he is well cared for will I leave his side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Princess\u2014\u201d Christien began.</p><p>She continued. \u201cThese monks are men of God, are they not? I will simply ask them to keep silent as to how Liam came to be at the abbey. If I can get them to promise, they cannot and will not break their word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are other ramifications,\u201d Stephen said. \u201cYou cannot get in the middle of a war.\u201d</p><p>She knew they weren\u2019t going to let up. \u201cWe shall compromise. Once Liam is safe and looked after, I will separate myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you will tell no one what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell no one.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>I T WAS SURPRISINGLY EASY TO GET INSIDE THE ABBEY UNSEEN. Not only was the door on the south end of the curtain wall that surrounded the monastic buildings unlatched, but it was also propped open. A priest had placed a stone in front of the door so that it would be easier for him to carry in bags of grain from the wagon across the path.</p><p>Gabrielle and her guards watched him from the cover of the trees behind the abbey. She thought the bags looked like they weighed more than the priest did. He wasn\u2019t quite an old man yet, possibly still in his early forties, she guessed, but he didn\u2019t have much muscle. He first tried to put the bag on one shoulder, nearly toppled over, and ended up wrapping his arms around the middle of the bag and letting the bottom drag between his legs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reining her horse into the open, she called out to him. \u201cFather, would you allow some help?\u201d</p><p>He was at first startled, and then he nodded vigorously. \u201cI would be most thankful for assistance,\u201d he called out.</p><p>Lucien and Faust had already dismounted and were headed to the wagon. Lucien noticed how the priest struggled under the weight of the bag and took it from him. \u201cWhere would you like this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJust inside the door on the left is a storage building. If you stack the grain there, I would be most appreciative.\u201d He pulled a cloth from the belt of his robes and mopped the sweat from the back of his neck. Smiling, he started toward Gabrielle. \u201cWelcome, I\u2019m Father Gelroy.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d just crossed the path when he noticed the injured man draped across Stephen\u2019s saddle.</p><p>\u201cWhat have we here?\u201d he demanded. He rushed to Stephen\u2019s side to get a better look, and he was so shocked by the man\u2019s condition he made a hasty sign of the cross. \u201cWhat happened to this poor fellow? Is he alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is,\u201d Christien answered.</p><p>Stephen dismounted and lifted Liam into his arms. \u201cThis man is in need of assistance as you can clearly see. Is there a healer here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, there is, and more than one,\u201d he answered in a rush. \u201cCome. Follow me.\u201d</p> <p>Lucien and Faust made quick work of unloading the grain. Gabrielle dismounted and handed the reins to Lucien.</p><p>The priest hurried to the door ahead of them. \u201cDoes this man have a name?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle answered. \u201cHis name is Liam MacHugh.\u201d</p><p>Father Gelroy\u2019s reaction was swift. He came to such an abrupt stop he actually swayed, then whirled around. His expression was one of disbelief, and the color had disappeared from his face.</p><p>\u201cDid I hear you say MacHugh?\u201d He was so rattled, he\u2019d shouted the question. \u201cTell me I didn\u2019t, but did I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather, please, lower your voice,\u201d Stephen instructed.</p> <p>The priest put his hand to his forehead. Gabrielle noticed it trembled.</p><p>\u201cMy God. You\u2019ve got Liam MacHugh and he\u2019s barely alive. If he dies...\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle stepped forward. \u201cWe are hopeful with the healer\u2019s help he won\u2019t die,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Father Gelroy forced himself to calm down. \u201cYes, yes, we must all be hopeful,\u201d he stammered. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this. There will be hell to pay if he dies. Quickly now. Inside with him. The room next to mine is empty. We\u2019ll put him in there. Once I\u2019ve shown you the way I\u2019ll go in search of Father Franklin. He\u2019s more skilled, I believe, than the others.\u201d</p><p>Lucien and Faust stayed with the horses while Stephen and Christien, carrying Liam, followed Gabrielle and the priest into the abbey. The corridor he led them down was dark, narrow, and smelled like the inside of a wet cave. All the doors were of dry splintered wood in arched frames. Father nodded to one as he rushed past and said, \u201cThat\u2019s my room.\u201d</p><p>He stopped in front of the next door, gently rapped on it with his knuckles to make certain it was still unoccupied, and then lifted the latch. He pushed the door, stepped inside, and held it open for them.</p><p>The room was tiny, with a small window set high above a wooden pallet that served as a bed. A gray wool blanket covered the straw mattress. A stool and a small chest were the room\u2019s only other pieces of furniture. A water bowl and pitcher flanked by two candles sat on top of the chest.</p><p>\u201cPut him on the bed. Gently now,\u201d the priest said. \u201cLet him sleep on his side so his back...good Lord, his poor back...\u201d He took a breath and slowly let it out. \u201cI believe Father Franklin is at vespers. I\u2019ll tell him to bring his medicines. When I come back, I\u2019ll fetch my stole and oils and give Liam MacHugh the last rites.\u201d</p> <p>Gabrielle protested. \u201cBut that sacrament is only for those who are dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you tell me he isn\u2019t dying?\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head. \u201cNay, I cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he must have the sacrament of Extreme Unction so that he can go to heaven unblemished.\u201d</p><p>He turned to leave, but Christien stepped in front of the door, blocking his exit.</p><p>\u201cFather, it would be for the better if no one knew how this man came to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I must first know if any of you had anything to do with his injuries. It\u2019s a foul question, but I must have an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was in this condition when we came upon him,\u201d Christien told him.</p><p>\u201cI thought as much, for why else would you carry such a burden?\u201d the priest returned. \u201cI promise you I won\u2019t be saying a word to anyone about Laird MacHugh\u2019s brother, but I would like to know what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you keep our confidence as well?\u201d Christien asked. \u201cIt would be for the better if you don\u2019t know who we are.\u201d</p><p>The priest shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too late for that. The second I saw this beautiful lady I knew who she was. There have been whispers of her coming for weeks now.\u201d</p><p>He turned to her and bowed low. \u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you, Lady Gabrielle. Have no worries, for if I am introduced to you in the future, I will be pleased to meet you then as though for the first time. Your secrets are safe with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Father,\u201d she said, but she doubted he heard her, for he had already rushed out of the room.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to leave, Princess,\u201d Stephen said.</p><p>Christien nodded agreement. \u201cAye, it\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>The two guards looked worried, and she was sorry to disappoint them.</p><p>\u201cI cannot leave him just yet. He\u2019s too vulnerable. Someone must watch over him while he is in this weakened state. Before I go, I must be certain that he is in capable hands and that he has the proper medicines.\u201d</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t be swayed. The argument that Father Franklin would be one more man they would have to trust to keep their confidence wasn\u2019t valid in her opinion. Father Franklin was also a man of God and would not break the promise they would get from him.</p><p>\u201cThe more people who know, the better the chance of the trail leading back to the man you killed...\u201d Stephen began.</p><p>\u201cThis man\u2019s life is more important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe cannot agree, Princess,\u201d Christien said, \u201cbut we will do your bidding.\u201d</p><p>Liam still hadn\u2019t opened his eyes or made any sounds at all, not even a groan when Father Franklin, who Gabrielle had to admit was quite capable, sewed his skin together. He\u2019d wanted to forgo the stitches and sear the wound with a hot poker, but she wouldn\u2019t allow it. There seemed no need since the bleeding had stopped at last. There was another reason. Though she doubted the warrior would care about appearance, he was quite handsome, and a scar from stitches wouldn\u2019t be as terrible as a burn scar.</p><p>Once she was assured that nothing more could be done for the wounded man, Gabrielle finally consented to trust his care to the two priests.</p><p>The sun was setting when Gabrielle finally left Liam\u2019s side.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>G ABRIELLE\u2019S ARRIVAL AT THE FRONT GATES OF ARBANE Abbey was met with great jubilation.</p><p>The abbot had given orders to summon him the minute she appeared, and he now hurriedly rushed forward, tying his cincture around his rotund stomach and breathlessly calling out for food and drink.</p><p>With a grand bow, he stammered, \u201cSuch an honor. It is such an honor to offer you our humble hospitality, milady. Yes, we\u2019re truly, truly honored.\u201d</p><p>He clasped her hand and squeezed. He didn\u2019t let go until she forcefully pulled her hand back.</p><p>She introduced her guards to the abbot and said, \u201cWe thank you for opening your rooms to us, and I thank you for allowing my wedding to take place here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are thrilled to have the honor. Everyone has been making preparations for the holy sacrament for some time, and now, to think it\u2019s only a week away. This union will surely secure a peaceful and lasting bond between our two noble countries.\u201d Snapping his fingers, he motioned for a servant to hurry and make preparations. \u201cYou must be hungry and thirsty. Come inside. We have refreshments for you and your soldiers. I understand they do not leave your side when you are away from home. Is that not true?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is true, but I am happy for their company.\u201d</p><p>A pretty young woman rushed forward and thrust a bouquet of flowers in Gabrielle\u2019s face. Gabrielle took them and thanked her, smiling when the woman made a quick and awkward curtsy.</p><p>\u201cThese are lovely,\u201d she called out as the woman scurried away.</p><p>\u201cWas your journey pleasant?\u201d the abbot asked.</p><p>Gabrielle didn\u2019t laugh, but she wanted to, wondering what he would think if she blurted the truth about their journey. They had been inside the abbey for hours now, but the abbot couldn\u2019t know that. Gabrielle and her guards had gotten back on their horses and had circled through the forest so they could approach Arbane Abbey by its front gate. Their trip had taken a few minutes at the most, but since they were keeping silent about Liam MacHugh, she could only say, \u201cIt was most pleasant, but I would like to change my gown before I have refreshments.\u201d</p><p>The cloak hid the stains from Liam\u2019s blood. Since the weather was still warm, the abbot must have thought she was ill to be wearing such a heavy garment.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course. Brother Anselm waits inside to show you the way to your rooms. I pray they meet with your satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain I will be most comfortable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe began to worry when the time passed and you hadn\u2019t arrived. We expected you hours ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to have caused you concern. Your countryside is so lovely I lost track of the time.\u201d</p><p>The abbot seemed satisfied with her answer. He took her arm and started walking.</p><p>\u201cGuests have been arriving and setting up their camps outside of our monastery for days. Most are from England as one would expect, but some came from as far away as France and Spain, all bearing gifts to mark this auspicious occasion. The contingent from your family\u2019s homeland of St. Biel brought the most wonderful gift of all, I believe. It is a lovely sculpture of your patron saint. They have asked us to hold it in our chapel\u2019s sacristy for safekeeping until the wedding, and I\u2019m sure Laird Monroe will want to set it in a sacred place of honor in his own chapel. You\u2019ll see some of the other offerings at the banquet...\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle smiled and nodded as the abbot continued to chatter on about the gifts and the visitors and the feasts. It was apparent the abbey had never seen such a celebration, and she was happy to indulge his enthusiasm.</p><p>They\u2019d just entered the commons when the abbot stopped and motioned to a man crossing their path.</p><p>\u201cYou must meet Laird MacKenna. He, too, is a guest, but he\u2019s leaving shortly. Laird,\u201d he called out, \u201ccome and meet Lady Gabrielle. She has finally arrived.\u201d</p><p>The man turned and walked toward them with a smile that seemed genuine and warm. His stride was long, and he carried himself proudly. His wavy black hair was swept back from his high forehead, and there wasn\u2019t a single scar on his flawless features. He must lead a charmed life, she decided.</p><p>He bowed to her. \u201cI have heard it said that you are a beauty, and I must say it was not an exaggeration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you for the compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are aware that Lady Gabrielle is to be married here to Laird Monroe,\u201d the abbot said.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I know,\u201d Laird MacKenna answered. \u201cHe\u2019s my friend,\u201d he said to Gabrielle, \u201cand I will attend the celebration at his request. It will be a great day for both of our countries. Returning the glen...I mean Finney\u2019s Flat...to a Highlander will bring peace among the clans, for Laird Monroe will see that it is used wisely. I look forward to the ceremony.\u201d He bowed again. \u201cUntil then...\u201d he said and took his leave.</p><p>The abbot waited until he was out of sight and then said, \u201cLaird MacKenna surprised us with such an act of kindness. He brought us a wagon full of grain from his fields. He\u2019s never been so generous before, and we were quite stunned and pleased. The laird has become a thoughtful man. Ah, here is Brother Anselm. He will show you the way.\u201d</p><p>The two rooms assigned to Gabrielle were in the largest wing of the abbey. They were surprisingly spacious and had connecting doors on either side. Servants were busy unpacking her clothes in preparation for the festivities ahead. Gabrielle kept her cloak wrapped around her until she was alone in her room. She wasn\u2019t sure what to do about the blood on her cream-colored bliaut, and she couldn\u2019t come up with a plausible explanation as to why it was there. She ended up folding the garment and hiding it in the bottom of one of her trunks.</p><p>Later that evening, after her maids had gone to bed, Faust and Lucien led Gabrielle to Liam\u2019s room to check on him. Father Franklin and Father Gelroy were both there and in the middle of a heated argument.</p><p>\u201cHas he awakened yet?\u201d she asked in a whisper so as not to disturb the patient.</p><p>Franklin smiled at her. \u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t, but he\u2019s done some moaning, and I\u2019ve a good feeling he\u2019ll wake up soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr he won\u2019t,\u201d Gelroy said, scowling. \u201cHe isn\u2019t out of danger, now is he, Franklin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne must have hope, Gelroy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he dies, Colm MacHugh will tear this place apart, sacred or not. It won\u2019t matter to him. He needs to be told that his brother is here. Hopefully he\u2019ll come to fetch him before Liam dies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he dies,\u201d Franklin snapped. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he will. I do agree that Laird MacHugh should be told Liam is here. I think you should leave with morning light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be happy to take over your duties while you make the trip to the MacHugh holding,\u201d Gelroy responded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too old and feeble to make this journey,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Gelroy snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re neither too old nor too feeble. What you are is afraid, Franklin. Aye, that\u2019s what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m afraid. In fact, I\u2019m more afraid than you are,\u201d he boasted in a low voice. \u201cAnd older by two years, which is why you should go on this errand, and I should stay. My heart couldn\u2019t take Laird MacHugh\u2019s disappointment.\u201d</p><p>Before Franklin could work up a rebuttal, Gelroy turned to Gabrielle. \u201cWe\u2019ve been bickering about this for over an hour now.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand your hesitance. I would think that Laird MacHugh would be overjoyed to learn that his brother is alive.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Franklin allowed. \u201cBut what if Liam were to die before Colm MacHugh could get here? And after Gelroy has told him Liam\u2019s alive. What then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean to say after you tell him Liam\u2019s alive,\u201d Gelroy snapped.</p><p>\u201cI believe you\u2019re borrowing trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this Colm MacHugh must be told. He\u2019s surely frantic by now. If someone I loved disappeared, I don\u2019t know what I would do.\u201d</p><p>Though they had been discussing the issue in low voices, Gabrielle felt they should move into the hallway so they wouldn\u2019t disturb Liam.</p> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t hear us,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cHe\u2019s still in a deep sleep.\u201d</p><p>Gelroy followed Gabrielle into the hall and closed the door behind him. \u201cI promise you, milady, that Franklin and I will work this out. Have no worries. One of us will make certain Colm MacHugh is informed of his brother\u2019s whereabouts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy guards have asked me to inquire if you would like their assistance sitting with Liam during the nights ahead. He shouldn\u2019t be left alone.\u201d</p><p>Gelroy was both pleased and relieved by the offer. \u201cI would be most appreciative for their help. Franklin and I promised you that we wouldn\u2019t tell anyone how this poor soul came to be here, but we have also decided that it would be for the best if we didn\u2019t mention Liam at all. There would be too many questions and speculations. We\u2019ll keep his presence secret for as long as possible. So you see, we cannot ask any of the others to sit with him because the secret will then be out.\u201d</p><p>Franklin stepped forward. \u201cGelroy told me that he doesn\u2019t know what happened to Liam or who inflicted the severe beating, but he and I promise you, whoever it was won\u2019t get another opportunity to do him harm while he is a guest here. With the help of your guards we will all make certain he remains safe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish I could be more helpful and take a turn sitting with him, but I realize\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucien interrupted. \u201cYou cannot, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be proper for you to be in a man\u2019s room, no matter if he were sleeping or not,\u201d Franklin told her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t argue, for she knew he was right.</p><p>Turning to Gelroy, she said, \u201cAnd one of you will go to the MacHugh holding?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders slumped. \u201cAye. One of us will go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou understand, milady. Whoever goes won\u2019t be coming back,\u201d Franklin said matter-of-factly.</p><p>Gelroy was nodding agreement when Franklin patted him on his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll miss you, Gelroy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a dangerous journey?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot particularly,\u201d Franklin answered.</p><p>\u201cWill it take long to get there then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot overly long,\u201d Gelroy answered.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t the getting there that\u2019s the worry, milady. It\u2019s the getting out of there that has us worried.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle was certain their fears of the MacHughs were exaggerated. They couldn\u2019t be as fearsome as the priests were insinuating.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go soon?\u201d she pressed.</p><p>\u201cVery soon,\u201d Gelroy promised.</p><p>The priest\u2019s definition of very soon was different from Gabrielle\u2019s. It took him three full days and nights to gather his courage to head out. By that time Liam had improved enough that Gelroy could feel confident he would survive, but the priest was still apprehensive. Even though he knew he must carry the news to Laird MacHugh, he still had his doubts that he would be returning to Arbane Abbey.</p><p>Father Gelroy finally rode out on a borrowed mount, but his destination wasn\u2019t the MacHugh holding. After putting considerable thought into the matter, he decided instead to go to MacHugh\u2019s loyal ally, Laird Buchanan. Gelroy foolishly believed that Brodick Buchanan would be easier to talk to and less likely to physically react to the news that Laird MacHugh\u2019s brother had been severely beaten.</p><p>The closer he got to the Buchanan land, the more violent his trembling became until he feared he would shake himself off his horse. But God took mercy on him. As he was resting under a huge oak tree just below the Buchanan holding, he spotted a horse and rider coming down the broken trail.</p><p>Now he had a dilemma on his hands. He didn\u2019t know if the rider was friend or foe. Should he try to hide? No, the rider had already spotted him. Gelroy said a prayer and decided to hope for the best.</p><p>Lo and behold, it was Baron Geoffrey riding toward him. He made the sign of the cross in thanksgiving, and as soon as the baron was within shouting distance, Gelroy called out to him. He reminded him that they had met before at the abbey, nearly two years ago. Without mentioning the baron\u2019s daughter, Gelroy asked the baron if he had been with the Buchanans. \u201cIt seemed to me you were coming from their land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was,\u201d Baron Geoffrey answered.</p><p>\u201cDo you know the Buchanans well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are distantly related, and though I had thought to pay my respects and not linger more than one night, a tragedy occurred. A warrior was missing. The men were out searching for him and were expected to come back to the holding yesterday but were delayed by a terrible rainstorm the night before. I had to wait for Laird Buchanan to return home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould the warrior\u2019s name be Liam MacHugh?\u201d he asked mildly.</p><p>\u201cAye. So you have heard what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen him,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was brought to the abbey, the poor soul.\u201d</p><p>The baron was rendered speechless. Gelroy took advantage of his condition.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be getting a high place in heaven, even though you\u2019re English, if you\u2019ll go back and tell Laird Buchanan this news so that he can tell Laird MacHugh.\u201d</p><p>While Baron Geoffrey was reeling from the information given so casually, Father Gelroy turned around and nudged his mount into a trot down the mountain.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d the baron shouted. \u201cYou cannot go without\u2014Is Liam still alive?\u201d</p><p>Gelroy slapped his horse\u2019s hindquarters to get it to speed up. Without glancing back, he called over his shoulder, \u201cOh God, I hope so.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>T HE LAIRDS WHO LIVED IN THE NORTHERN HIGHLANDS were a prickly group. They were known to be unpredictable, unreasonable, and ungracious. They were also known to be savages upon occasion. Yet if Baron Geoffrey were to accuse any of them of these flaws, they would believe he was flattering them.</p><p>Aye, they were a peculiar lot, and no one, Geoffrey believed, was more peculiar or hardheaded than Laird Brodick Buchanan. Brodick didn\u2019t have any problem letting Geoffrey know that, even though they were related, he still disliked him intensely because he was English. Since Brodick\u2019s wife also happened to be from England and was Geoffrey\u2019s cousin, Brodick explained very bluntly that he couldn\u2019t come right out and say that he hated all the English, just some.</p><p>The rude laird also told Geoffrey that he didn\u2019t want him stepping foot on his land, yet Geoffrey knew that if he honored the laird\u2019s wishes and didn\u2019t pay his respects when he was in the area\u2014and every laird in the Highlands would know that he was\u2014then Brodick would consider the slight a grave insult and would have no choice but to retaliate.</p><p>The baron had only visited once before, just after Brodick married Lady Gillian. He had been asked by his uncle Morgan to check on Gillian\u2019s well-being. Morgan, Geoffrey\u2019s father\u2019s youngest brother, was a cranky, reclusive old man, who couldn\u2019t believe that Gillian would be content living in the Highlands among the wild Buchanans. To Geoffrey\u2019s surprise, he found Gillian not only content but quite happy. She could not have been more gracious to him, and her kindness more than made up for her husband\u2019s hostility.</p><p>Although he would never admit it to Brodick, Geoffrey was impressed with him and his wife. They didn\u2019t live in a fine castle but rather a small cottage no bigger than Geoffrey\u2019s steward\u2019s home. It was apparent that neither Brodick nor Gillian cared about impressing outsiders but, rather, concentrated on more important issues. Brodick\u2019s sole duty was to protect his wife and his clan. Gillian\u2019s duty, at the moment anyway, was to protect her unborn child. She wanted to attend Gabrielle\u2019s wedding, of course, but from the moment she had informed Brodick that he was going to become a father, leaving their holding was out of the question.</p><p>The priest who had intercepted Geoffrey and given him the news about Liam MacHugh acted as though he had a pack of wild dogs on his tail. As soon as he had blurted out the news, he had turned and urged his mount into a full gallop and had disappeared into the trees.</p><p>Geoffrey headed back to the Buchanan holding, but Brodick wasn\u2019t happy to see him again so soon. He certainly wasn\u2019t in the mood to put up with another social call.</p><p>The laird was an intimidating sight as he stormed toward Geoffrey. Tall and muscular, he was fair-haired and battle-scarred, and he wore a scowl as black as night. His first in command, a fierce warrior named Dylan, followed in his laird\u2019s wake. Then two more warriors joined the procession.</p><p>Geoffrey rested his hands on the pommel of his saddle and waited for Brodick to reach him. The laird\u2019s greeting wasn\u2019t pleasant, but then Geoffrey didn\u2019t expect it to be.</p><p>\u201cI thought I was rid of you, Baron.\u201d</p><p>Geoffrey ignored the insult. \u201cLiam MacHugh is at Arbane Abbey.\u201d</p><p>His announcement took the scowl off Brodick\u2019s face. \u201cIs he alive?\u201d</p><p>The baron quickly recounted what the priest had told him, and when he was finished, Brodick asked, \u201cWhat in thunder does \u2018I hope so\u2019 mean? Liam\u2019s either alive or he isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must have meant that Liam was alive the last time he saw him,\u201d Geoffrey suggested. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell Laird MacHugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>Brodick turned around and walked away from Geoffrey, dismissing him. He was barking orders to his men. He would go with MacHugh to the abbey. There was no doubt in his mind that Colm MacHugh would stop at nothing to find out who had done this to his brother. If God was merciful, Liam MacHugh would be alive when they got there.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>W HILE GELROY HAD BEEN WORKING UP THE COURAGE to make the trip to inform Liam\u2019s family of his whereabouts, Gabrielle had been filling her days with social obligations and preparations for the wedding. In the late of night she would leave her chamber to look in on Liam while he slept. Her guards stood watch at his door. Father Franklin explained to his patient when he finally opened his eyes that, even though the abbey was a sanctuary and was therefore considered holy ground by all good, God-fearing men and women, he wasn\u2019t going to take any chances that a heathen might sneak in and do Liam further injury. He told Liam that Lady Gabrielle had arrived for her wedding with a contingent of guards, and he had asked for their help. In his weakened condition, Liam didn\u2019t protest. He was aware that they were watching over him, but he didn\u2019t speak to them, and when they spoke to one another, it was in a language that Liam had never heard and couldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>ONCE LIAM WAS CONSCIOUS, Father Gelroy announced that he would be leaving to deliver his message, and he set out the following dawn. He returned at nightfall. When he knocked on Gabrielle\u2019s door, she was happy to see him, but she was surprised that he had returned from his important errand so quickly. She made him comfortable in a chair on the balcony, offered him refreshment, and then took her seat across from him.</p><p>\u201cYou are well, Father?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd you, milady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am most well,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut I am quite curious. May I ask, how were you able to complete your errand in such a short time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rode hard and fast,\u201d he boasted.</p><p>A servant stood in the doorway with a tray. Gabrielle motioned to her, and she offered a goblet of cool water to the priest. Father Gelroy thanked her with a smile and a nod and then took a hefty drink.</p><p>\u201cWas Laird MacHugh overjoyed with the news about his brother? Was he relieved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine he was overjoyed and relieved,\u201d he answered. \u201cYou see, I didn\u2019t go to the MacHugh holding. I thought it would be more prudent...yes, prudent,\u201d he repeated, \u201cto go to the Buchanan holding and give Laird Buchanan the news so that he could have the honor of telling Laird MacHugh. The Buchanans are allies of the MacHughs, and their holding is much closer to the abbey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Gabrielle folded her hands in her lap and asked, \u201cAnd was Laird Buchanan overjoyed and relieved with the news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine he was,\u201d he said a bit sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d she asked, thoroughly confused.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cAs it turned out, I didn\u2019t need to go all the way to the Buchanan holding. Your father was just leaving their land by the only safe route, and I was able to intercept the baron and give him the joyful news. I\u2019m certain he was happy to tell Laird Buchanan.\u201d</p><p>It seemed to Gabrielle that the priest had made a simple errand quite complicated. His fear of Laird MacHugh was most unreasonable. After all, the priest had good news to relay to the laird. Why would he worry that the man would do him harm?</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m certain he was,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYour father should be here soon now,\u201d he remarked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be happy to see him. Perhaps he will go riding with me in the countryside. I don\u2019t wish to complain, but I would love to leave the abbey for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe countryside is crowded these days,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are envoys from many countries who have arrived for the wedding. Several barons from England have set up camp here. And as you know, when they travel, they bring all the comforts of home. I have heard that one tent is as big as our church. Your wedding to Laird Monroe promises to be a grand occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m amazed they would travel this long distance for the ceremony,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cThis is an important event for many people,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Father Franklin interrupted with a hard knock on the door. As soon as the servant bid him enter, the priest rushed into the chamber. When he saw Gelroy, he came to a quick stop and motioned for him to join him.</p><p>\u201cIt appears Franklin\u2019s wanting a private word with me. I think I know what this is about. I missed noon prayers,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd I imagine he\u2019s wanting to give me a good lecture.\u201d</p><p>A moment later the two priests were in deep discussion, whispering back and forth. Gabrielle\u2019s attention was drawn to the commons below. She leaned over the railing and saw a priest running and shouting to two others coming out of the chapel, but she couldn\u2019t make out what he was saying. The commons quickly filled with men, and all of them seemed highly agitated, waving their arms and shaking their heads. A few priests made the sign of the cross, knelt down, and began to pray. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something terrible had happened.</p><p>\u201cLady Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>Father Gelroy begged her attention.

He cannot marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he can\u2019t marry her,\u201d Franklin muttered.</p><p>\u201cHe cannot?\u201d she asked, trying to understand.</p> <p>\u201cNo, milady, he cannot,\u201d Gelroy blurted. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>I T WAS A PITY HE DIDN\u2019T HAVE TIME TO MAKE THE MURDER look like an accident. It would have made his life so much easier. He had considered the possibility of suffocating Monroe, but a dying man could very well summon the strength of ten when he was fighting for his life. No, suffocation was too risky.</p><p>And so was drowning. What if he were a stronger swimmer? Or a screamer? One loud shout could bring him help. Drowning, he had decided, was also out of the question.</p><p>He had considered several other methods that would pass for accidents, but he eventually ruled all of them out. Some were too complicated, others relied too heavily on strength and timing.</p><p>In the end he had settled on using a knife. A sharp blade was a quick and easy kill. Unfortunately, no one would ever believe it was an accident. How could anyone accidentally fall on a knife five or six times? It took several good thrusts to kill Laird Monroe.</p> <p>He had killed before, but never like this. Because of his position of power he would usually give such an unpleasant duty to someone else. But this was different. He didn\u2019t dare trust anyone else with this onerous task. He had to do it alone. It was the only way to make certain the trail wouldn\u2019t lead back to him.</p><p>Fortunately Monroe had become complacent in recent years. He didn\u2019t take care like he should, and his followers had become just as lax in their guard. They didn\u2019t expect trouble because their laird didn\u2019t have enemies. How could he? He never took sides with one clan against another, and he never wanted more than what he already had. The laird had absolutely no ambition and was as lukewarm as old bathwater.</p><p>The laird never varied his routine. Every night just before sundown he took a long stroll, no matter what the weather, no matter where he was staying. He always walked alone.</p><p>Crouching in the darkness and waiting for Monroe had been uncomfortable and tedious, but once the rustle of leaves told him Monroe was coming, he gripped his knife tightly and patiently waited for the perfect time to spring.</p><p>It was unfortunate, but it was unavoidable. Laird Monroe had experienced a very unpleasant death.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>T HE FUNERAL MASS WAS SAID IN THE ABBEY\u2019S NORTH chapel. Many of the Monroe clan had been on their way to the wedding when they received news of the laird\u2019s sudden demise, and their happy journey of celebration had turned into a mournful and somber procession instead. Several Highland lairds attended the funeral, but many more would have ridden the distance to pay their last respects had they known about Monroe\u2019s death. The ritual\u2014one day after his death\u2014had to be hurried due to the unusually warm weather and the rapidly deteriorating condition of the body.</p><p>The English weren\u2019t welcome, though it was doubtful that any of the barons would have wanted to sit and listen to the priest extol the virtues of the dead man. He was, after all, a Highlander, which in their view made him inferior and not worthy of their prayers.</p> <p>Baron Geoffrey of Wellingshire and his daughter, Lady Gabrielle, were the only exceptions. The Monroe family allowed their presence because the lady had been pledged to marry their laird. She was allowed to hear mass with them, but she and her father were seated in the last row. Although there was plenty of room, no one would sit next to them.</p><p>Gabrielle didn\u2019t expect special consideration. She was thankful that she was given the chance to pray for Laird Monroe\u2019s soul. Her father and others held the laird in such high regard and praised him because he was such a good and kind man. Why would anyone want to harm him? His murder didn\u2019t make any sense. Robbery wasn\u2019t the motive, for nothing had been taken from his body. His gold ring and jeweled dirk were still on him when he was found. Was he killed just for the sport of it?</p><p>Her mind wandered, and she thought about Liam MacHugh and the terrible men who had made him suffer so. How could one man treat another with such depravity?</p><p>Mass ended and Monroe\u2019s body, wrapped in white linen, was carried out. Gabrielle kept her head bowed as the procession of mourners filed from the chapel. She happened to glance up once and noticed that most of them were glaring at her as they walked by.</p><p>When the last couple, a young man with an older woman, reached her, they stopped. Gabrielle could feel the woman\u2019s piercing eyes, and she raised her head.</p><p>\u201cGo home. You have no place here,\u201d the woman hissed. Her words spewed out like poisonous venom.</p><p>The young man quickly took the woman\u2019s shoulder and gently turned her toward the procession. \u201cCome, Mother, my uncle wouldn\u2019t want anger.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle\u2019s face burned. She had never heard such contempt before.</p><p>As they slowly made their way down the aisle, the man turned to give Gabrielle a sympathetic smile.</p><p>Her father laid his hand on her arm to keep her from standing to leave. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait until the Monroes are gone,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cThat woman was Laird Monroe\u2019s sister. I think it would be best that we not follow them. There could be other insults.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would they want to insult me?\u201d she asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cThe Monroe clan has decided that you are the reason their laird is dead.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him as though he was speaking nonsense.</p><p>\u201cThey hold you responsible for their laird\u2019s death,\u201d her father restated.</p><p>She was appalled. \u201cThey think I killed him? How could they think such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou misunderstand, Gabrielle. They don\u2019t think you stabbed him, but they do believe that if their laird had stayed home and hadn\u2019t agreed to marry you, he would still be alive. Monroe and his followers were camped in a nearby glen the night he was murdered, and since he was on his way here to the abbey to marry you, they believe you caused his death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>He patted her hand. \u201cYes, it is. Don\u2019t let their foolishness bother you.\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cI can withstand their insults. I\u2019m not so weak that I would fall apart over a cruel word or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have tender feelings, daughter, whether you will admit it or not.\u201d</p><p>The door opened behind them, and Stephen stepped inside. \u201cIt\u2019s safe now. The Monroe mourners have left, and the baron who was waiting at the door has returned to his camp.\u201d</p><p>Her father nodded. \u201cThen we can go. Come, Gabrielle. Your guards will escort you back to your rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStephen, what baron was at the door?\u201d</p><p>Her father answered her. \u201cPercy.\u201d He stepped into the aisle and moved back so Gabrielle could walk in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand why he came for the wedding? He isn\u2019t your friend or ally, and I doubt he knew Laird Monroe,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her father sighed. \u201cI should have explained this a long time ago. Percy says he was sent by the king\u2019s command to witness the ceremony, but I\u2019m sure he had other motives. I had thought to shield you. Baron Percy and Baron Coswold are two very manipulative men who will stop at nothing to get what they want. I had hoped that once you were married they would give up their obsession.\u201d</p><p>He motioned for Stephen to open the doors.</p><p>\u201cWas I right, Stephen?\u201d he asked as they walked down the steps. \u201cWas Percy waiting for a chance to speak with Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Baron. He was lurking by the side of the chapel, and he had his friends with him. I haven\u2019t seen Baron Coswold yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoswold traveled to Scotland. I\u2019m sure of that. But God only knows what he\u2019s up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would either one of them want to speak to me?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cI will explain what needs be told later,\u201d her father said. \u201cGo now and have your servants pack your things. You\u2019ll be going back to England tomorrow morning. If it were not so late in the day, I would have you leave now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut aren\u2019t you going with me, Father?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I must go to the king first. He has been told of Monroe\u2019s death by now, and I will need to get his approval for our return to England. I will catch up with you in a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre Coswold and Percy the reason you\u2019re so anxious to go home?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, they are the reason,\u201d he answered grimly.</p><p>They entered the commons, walking side by side, with Stephen and Faust trailing behind.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t told you what I have learned about these two and their obscene competition, but it appears that whatever one baron wants, the other must also have. Everything becomes a game to them to see who will win and who will lose.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head in disgust. \u201cI thought you would be rid of them once you married Laird Monroe, and I cannot tell you how stunned I was to find that Percy had arrived here for the wedding and had set up camp outside the abbey. I expect Coswold will appear at any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDead men can\u2019t marry,\u201d Faust remarked. \u201cHow fortuitous for them that Laird Monroe was murdered.\u201d</p><p>Stephen nodded. \u201c\u2019Tis most convenient, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Baron Geoffrey turned to him. \u201cI was thinking the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting...\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cYou have been sheltered from the evil in this world, and so you cannot imagine what men are capable of. Let me tell you what I encountered when I arrived at the Buchanans. Laird Buchanan and many of his soldiers were with their allies, the MacHughs, searching for Laird MacHugh\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>Her father didn\u2019t spare the details when he explained what the monsters who had captured Liam had wanted to do.</p><p>\u201cI was told there was blood on the rope they bound him with and a hole was dug to bury him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they know who these men were, my lord?\u201d Stephen asked.</p><p>\u201cNay, they do not. Brodick and Laird MacHugh found one of them on the ground near the hole, but no one recognized him. He didn\u2019t wear the colors of any clan to identify him. Brodick returned home for a short while. I was waiting for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you search with him, Father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeavens no. He would never allow it, but as it turned out, MacHugh\u2019s brother was found. As I was leaving Brodick\u2019s land, out of the forest came a priest with joyful news. He asked me to tell Laird Buchanan that Liam MacHugh was here at the abbey.\u201d</p><p>Her father smiled. \u201cThe poor priest couldn\u2019t get away fast enough, and he wouldn\u2019t answer my questions. I imagine the MacHugh clan will be overjoyed to hear that Liam is alive and safe. Has the abbot mentioned anything about this poor injured soul being here?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle cast a furtive glance over her father\u2019s shoulder at Stephen before answering. \u201cNo, the abbot has told us nothing of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just as well,\u201d her father said. \u201cThe less of this brutality you see, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI choose to believe that there is more good than evil in this world,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou have your mother\u2019s kind heart, Gabrielle.\u201d Baron Geoffrey kissed her lightly on the cheek before he left her. \u201cI must make haste and speak to my soldiers. There\u2019s much to be done before I leave, but I will make certain to say farewell to the abbot.\u201d</p><p>As soon as her father had turned the corner, she looked at Stephen. \u201cI feel as though I have deceived my father by not telling him how we found Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou protect the baron by not telling him. None of us could know the ramifications of killing one man and saving another. They are both strangers to us. Your father should not be put in the middle, and that could very well happen. It is best that we are going home.\u201d</p><p>She agreed. \u201cThis has been a sad journey.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p><p>G ABRIELLE WAS ABOUT TO GO INTO HER ROOM WHEN Father Gelroy called to her.</p><p>\u201cMilady, a word, please?\u201d</p><p>He ran toward her, robes flapping against his ankles. His face was bright red, and he was frowning intently.</p><p>She didn\u2019t think she could handle more bad news. Bracing herself, she walked toward him. \u201cYes, Father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d He was panting so rapidly, he could barely get the words out.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe MacHugh laird and the Buchanan laird. Both have their warriors with them. They\u2019re at the top of the hill overlooking the abbey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is good news, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no. I mean yes,\u201d he stuttered. \u201cThey\u2019ve come for Liam, and that\u2019s very good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should go and greet them, shouldn\u2019t you? And take Laird MacHugh to his brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Gelroy answered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Of course it\u2019s necessary. Laird MacHugh has come all this way, and he should be taken to see his brother,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cOh, he\u2019ll see him. I\u2019m sure of that,\u201d Gelroy asserted. \u201cBut the laird won\u2019t be taken to him.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle was more confused than ever. \u201cThen how will he see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiam\u2019s waiting outside the gates,\u201d the priest blurted.</p><p>Shocked, Gabrielle said, \u201cThat poor man hasn\u2019t been able to rise from his bed since he got here. How could he possibly get outside the gates of the abbey?\u201d</p><p>Gelroy couldn\u2019t look her in the eye when he answered. \u201cFather Franklin and I carried him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just left him there?\u201d She couldn\u2019t believe what the priest was telling her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. Laird MacHugh is a mighty warrior. Everyone has heard of his amazing strength...and his amazing temper.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly the situation became clear to her. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a fool is unafraid of Laird MacHugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut just abandoning the poor man\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Gelroy said. \u201cI think you\u2019ll understand when you see for yourself. Don\u2019t worry. They won\u2019t be able to see you. We\u2019ll climb the wall and peek out. I\u2019ll show you the way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The priest led Gabrielle outside and up the narrow steps to an opening carved out of the thick stone wall.</p><p>Gelroy pointed to the hill. \u201cCan you see them?\u201d</p><p>Her sharply indrawn breath answered his question. The sight of the warriors had rendered her speechless, and she could only summon a quick nod.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any trouble locating the lairds. The two men were in front of their followers, each atop a magnificent horse, one black, the other gray. Both men looked as though they\u2019d been fashioned by a god of ancient times. She knew that Zeus never actually existed, but when she looked at these giants, she couldn\u2019t help but think that maybe...</p> <p>\u201cThe one on the right is Laird MacHugh,\u201d Gelroy said.</p><p>Was he real? She closed her eyes, opened them again, and he was still there.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s quite...large, isn\u2019t he? They both are actually,\u201d she said, glancing from MacHugh to Buchanan.</p><p>The priest laughed. \u201cThey\u2019re Highlanders,\u201d he said, as though that explained everything. \u201cThey are not as civilized as the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have come here for one of their own, which tells me they are capable of brotherly love. They are human, Father,\u201d she said with a hint of disapproval at the priest\u2019s negative judgment.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s Liam,\u201d he whispered, even though he surely knew they couldn\u2019t possibly hear him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get to see their joyful reunion,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it wrong of us to intrude?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe so. Besides, they\u2019ll never know.\u201d</p><p>They watched another minute or two, and then she whispered, \u201cLiam\u2019s having trouble walking. Do you see how he\u2019s trying not to limp? He\u2019s favoring his right foot, isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s slowing down, too. How will he ever climb the hill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPride will get him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut pride is a sin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot to a Highlander.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle stared at Laird MacHugh. His expression was rigid. There was no trace of feeling in his eyes as he watched his brother struggle to move forward.</p><p>Barbarian, she decided. MacHugh was a barbarian. Had he no feelings for his own brother? He\u2019d come this far for him. Why wouldn\u2019t he help him now? Why wouldn\u2019t any of them help poor Liam?</p><p>They were all barbarians, she decided. Every last one of them.</p><p>Liam tried to stand erect, but when he moved his foot forward to take a step, he swayed and stumbled backward. Laird MacHugh immediately swung down from his horse and handed the reins to Laird Buchanan.</p><p>\u201cMy faith has been restored,\u201d she said. \u201cI was wrong to think ill of the laird. He\u2019s going to help Liam after all.\u201d Gabrielle smiled as she added, \u201c\u2019Tis brotherly love.\u201d</p><p>She watched in anticipation as the laird strode toward the weakened man. He didn\u2019t stop to speak to him; he didn\u2019t smile at him, and he certainly didn\u2019t embrace him.</p><p>What he did do was give his brother the full force of his fist.</p> <p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>B RODICK COULDN\u2019T BELIEVE HE WAS THE VOICE OF REASON. He was usually the hot-tempered one. But not today.</p><p>Today his duty was clear: to keep Colm from doing anything reckless, and that was no easy task. It had taken a great deal of talking for Brodick to convince him not to storm into the abbey and tear it apart room by room in order to find out what had happened to his brother.</p><p>Colm had been resistant, but managed to control his anger on the ride to the abbey. Then he saw Liam leaning against the abbey gate, and he began to burn with fury.</p><p>\u201cGood God,\u201d Brodick whispered when he saw Liam. He took a breath, remembered he had to be the rational one, and added, \u201cHe\u2019s alive.\u201d</p><p>Colm didn\u2019t respond. He could only watch Liam\u2019s faltering attempts to walk for one agonizing minute before he swung down from his mount and headed to fetch him. With one blow to his jaw, Liam teetered and collapsed across his brother\u2019s waiting shoulder.</p><p>Once Colm had situated his brother on the back of a horse, he motioned for two riders to flank his sides and sent them ahead.</p><p>\u201cSomeone knows what happened to my brother, Brodick. Whoever brought him to the abbey had to have witnessed something. There\u2019s no way in hell that Liam got up and walked away from that field. He had to be carried. Look at him, Brodick.\u201d The MacHugh nodded to the abbey and added, \u201cLiam didn\u2019t get there on his own. He had help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have been left at the gate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr he could have been taken inside. If someone in the abbey knows what happened, I\u2019ll find him, and I\u2019ll make him tell me what he knows, no matter how much force I have to use.\u201d</p><p>Brodick motioned to the tents set up outside the walls. \u201cWith all of these people around, you need to use your head. You can\u2019t just force your way inside the abbey. It\u2019s sacred, for God\u2019s sake. You can\u2019t even carry your sword or any other weapon with you when you walk through those gates.\u201d</p><p>Colm didn\u2019t appreciate being told what he could and could not do. He glanced at Brodick. \u201cSince when do you pay attention to rules? Marriage has made you weak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife would not be married to a weak man.\u201d</p><p>Colm swung up on his horse, grabbed the reins, and started back up the hill.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she\u2019s turned you into a weakling because she\u2019s weak. Most women are.\u201d</p><p>The insult amused Brodick. \u201cYou have met my wife, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Colm shrugged. \u201cAye, we\u2019ve met.\u201d There was a hint of a smile in his voice when he added, \u201cShe\u2019s a strong woman. A rarity, that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, she is strong, and trying to antagonize me won\u2019t work. I\u2019m not going to help you wage war on a group of old men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of waging war on the priests. I\u2019m simply going to find out what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore you do anything, perhaps you should talk to your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m headed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably shouldn\u2019t have hit him so hard. How long do you think it will take him to wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome water on his face will bring him around.\u201d</p><p>As the column of riders slowly made their way down the other side of the hill, Colm said, \u201cDid you see what was done to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw,\u201d Brodick answered quietly.</p><p>It would be a long time before Colm would be able to let go of the memory of his brother trying to walk toward him. It appeared that almost every inch of skin on his brother\u2019s back and legs had been torn or ripped off of him.</p><p>No, he would not soon forget that godawful sight.</p><p>\u201cYour men should take Liam to Kevin Drummond\u2019s cottage. His wife has a way with healing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, they\u2019re taking him home. He\u2019ll get the care he needs there. I want you to understand, after I\u2019ve questioned him, I\u2019m going into the abbey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m going with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. I\u2019m already in your debt. Those bastards would have buried Liam if you and your men hadn\u2019t shown up when you did. I never would have gotten to him in time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dead one near the hole with the arrow in his chest...that wasn\u2019t done by one of ours,\u201d Brodick reminded him.</p><p>\u201cI still owe you a tremendous debt.\u201d</p><p>Brodick smiled. \u201cAye, you do.\u201d</p><p>They caught up with the others. Dylan, Brodick\u2019s first in command, trailed behind MacHugh\u2019s soldiers. He heard Brodick\u2019s shrill whistle and stopped the procession.</p><p>There were a dozen from the MacHugh clan and almost as many Buchanans surrounding Liam.</p><p>Since they were so close to Duncan\u2019s Bluffs, they decided to let Liam rest for a few minutes before continuing on. Colm\u2019s brother was still groggy from the blow he took to the jaw. He refused assistance as he dismounted and nearly fell to his knees. Everyone saw that the bottoms of his feet were caked with blood, but no one rushed forward to help him. They waited for him to straighten himself and follow Colm to the flat rocks overlooking the valley.</p><p>Liam tried not to wince with each slow and painful step. When he finally reached the bluff, he dropped to the ground and leaned his shoulder against a smooth rock.</p><p>Colm\u2019s greeting to his brother was blunt. \u201cWho did this to you?\u201d He stepped in front of Liam and folded his arms across his chest as he waited for him to answer.</p><p>\u201cIf I knew who did this, I would have killed them by now,\u201d Liam answered.</p><p>It was an empty boast, and both of them knew it. His brother wasn\u2019t in any condition to kill anyone. His face was so gray, Colm thought he might pass out again. But Liam\u2019s pride was at issue, and for that reason Colm went along with his arrogant claim.</p><p>\u201cAye, you would have,\u201d he agreed. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember much,\u201d he said. \u201cI was leaving Monroe\u2019s holding, heading for home across the flats, but I stayed to the east by the water. I know I was still on Monroe\u2019s land. Yes, I\u2019m sure I was. Something struck me on the side of my head, and I think maybe I was hit again in the back. The blows stunned me, and when I came to my senses, my hands and feet were bound. There was a hood over my head.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes for a moment, trying to reclaim his memory. \u201cThere were at least four of them. I came to for a while, but I had to let them think I was still unconscious. I heard them talking before I passed out again. I\u2019m certain there were four distinct voices...no, wait.\u201d He sighed then, his frustration mounting. \u201cThere could have been more.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck and closed his eyes again.</p><p>\u201cDid any of them speak directly to you?\u201d Braeden, Colm\u2019s first in command, asked as he and some of the others circled.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Liam\u2019s voice grew hoarse and more difficult to understand with each answer he gave. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I remember? It\u2019s damned irritating.\u201d</p><p>To Colm, it was obvious why Liam\u2019s memory was so spotty. He\u2019d taken several blows to the head.</p><p>\u201cYou said you heard them talking. What were they saying?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>\u201cThat they hoped to kill as many MacHughs as they could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf there were only four or so captors, how could they possibly kill seasoned MacHugh warriors?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>Braeden handed Liam his leather water pouch. Liam took a long drink, nodded his appreciation to the commander, and then answered. \u201cThere were men hiding in the woods, waiting to attack. They\u2019d been told to get as many MacHughs as they could. The more they killed, the higher the reward.\u201d</p><p>He took another swallow before continuing. \u201cAnother one of them worried that there really weren\u2019t troops waiting in the woods to help them, and they would be all alone to face Colm\u2019s wrath. He wanted to kill me and be done with it, but the one in charge kept telling him they had to wait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait for what?\u201d Colm asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you hear any of their names?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>\u201cIf I did, I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>Colm continued to question his brother, hoping for some clue as to who was behind this atrocity, but Liam wasn\u2019t much help.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember being taken to the abbey?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, but I remember waking up there. I was in a little room. Two priests were with me. One was a healer, and the other wore his stole and prayed over me. I think he thought I was dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were these priests?\u201d Braeden asked.</p><p>\u201cFather Franklin was the healer. I asked him how I\u2019d gotten there, and he said he didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you believe him?\u201d Colm asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did, after he explained. He told me that Father Gelroy came to him and asked him for his help. Gelroy was the priest praying over me,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cAnd Father Franklin wasn\u2019t curious to know how you\u2019d gotten there?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>\u201cAye, he was curious. He asked me how I\u2019d been injured, and I told him I couldn\u2019t remember. I heard him ask Gelroy the same question, and Gelroy told him it was best if he didn\u2019t know the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this priest Gelroy? What did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he was outside unloading a wagon of grain when he happened to look up, and there I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you were? That\u2019s it? No one was with you?\u201d Colm asked.</p><p>\u201cI asked Gelroy that very question, and he couldn\u2019t give me an exact answer. When I asked him to explain what he meant, he said that he couldn\u2019t say yes and he couldn\u2019t say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe speaks in riddles,\u201d Colm snapped.</p><p>Liam tried to stand. Bracing his hand against the rock, he made it to his knees before falling back. Cursing his weakness, he rested another moment before trying again.</p><p>\u201cThis priest Gelroy will not speak in riddles to me,\u201d Colm said. \u201cHe will tell me what I wish to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColm, you need to understand. Gelroy sought to protect me. He was concerned that whoever had injured me might come inside the abbey\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo kill you.\u201d Brodick nodded as he finished Liam\u2019s thought.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cGelroy believed that the demons, as he called the men who attacked me, would not respect sanctuary. He and Franklin agreed to keep my presence secret as a safety measure until you arrived, Colm, but there was a problem. The two of them could not stand guard over me day and night without raising suspicion, and neither would be very effective against an intruder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how was this problem solved?\u201d Colm asked.</p><p>\u201cGelroy enlisted the help of a few good men he knew to protect me while I slept. He explained to me that he wanted men who understood the ways of fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPriests would have no such training,\u201d Braeden interjected.</p><p>\u201cNo, they wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Colm agreed.</p><p>He stopped pacing in front of his brother. \u201cWho did this priest find to watch over you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked soldiers who were there for Laird Monroe\u2019s wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat clan were these men from?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>Before Liam could answer, Colm asked, \u201cWere these men Highlanders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they were not, but Gelroy trusted them completely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they had to be Highlanders,\u201d Brodick reasoned.</p><p>All of the warriors listening to the conversation immediately nodded their agreement. Only Highlanders were to be trusted, and even then with caution.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you they were not Highlanders. I don\u2019t know where they came from, but Gelroy must have known them well to trust them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Colm knew he had to hurry with his questions, for he wanted to get as much information as he could from his weary brother before exhaustion caught up with him. Liam was already drowsy. He could barely keep his eyes open, and he was having trouble concentrating.</p><p>\u201cHow many were there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cHow many what?\u201d Liam asked wearily.</p><p>Colm held his patience. \u201cSoldiers, Liam. How many soldiers watched over you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFour. There were always two either inside the room with me or just outside my door.\u201d</p><p>Brodick glanced at Colm when he asked, \u201cAnd these men carried weapons?\u201d</p><p>Liam actually smiled. \u201cNo, they did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question amuses you?\u201d Brodick asked, trying to understand Liam\u2019s reaction.</p><p>\u201cAye, it does. When you see these men, you will understand why. But I will assure you of this, Laird Buchanan. They do not need weapons.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey are invincible? Is that what you suggest?\u201d Braeden asked as though the notion of such praise of an outsider\u2019s strength should be taken as a personal affront to his own might.</p><p>\u201cNo man is invincible,\u201d Colm snapped. \u201cWhat did these soldiers tell you, Liam? Did they explain how you came to the abbey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They talked to one another, but they wouldn\u2019t talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Both Colm and Brodick waited for Liam to explain further. When he didn\u2019t, Brodick asked, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they talk to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think they understood me,\u201d he said finally. \u201cAnd I certainly didn\u2019t understand them. They spoke a language I\u2019ve never heard before.\u201d</p><p>Colm was becoming even more frustrated. \u201cGelroy must have understood them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure he did. I never heard him speak to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did he\u2014\u201d Colm stopped. It was pointless to continue questioning his brother. Liam needed rest, and Colm hoped that when his brother grew stronger, he would be able to remember more about the men who had taken him captive.</p><p>Besides, he reasoned, Gelroy would tell him what he wanted to know.</p><p>He removed his sword and sheath and handed both to Braeden. \u201cTake Liam home,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>He went to his horse to get his bow and arrows and gave those to Braeden as well. \u201cAnd send the Buchanans home.\u201d With a glance at Brodick, he added, \u201cAll the Buchanans.\u201d</p><p>Before Colm could argue, Brodick swung up onto his mount and said, \u201cI am going back to the abbey with you.\u201d</p><p>Braeden nodded. \u201cDo you want any of us to go inside the abbey with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not.\u201d Colm\u2019s voice was unyielding.</p> <p>Braeden was used to his laird\u2019s gruff ways. \u201cThen may I suggest that half of our men take Liam home, and I and the others will wait outside the gates with your weapons, Laird.\u201d</p><p>Brodick\u2019s commander stepped forward to stand beside Braeden. \u201cAnd since my Laird Buchanan is going with you, I suggest that I also wait with our laird\u2019s weapons outside the gates. The other Buchanan soldiers will see Liam safely home.\u201d</p><p>Brodick agreed. \u201cIt would be to our advantage to take our swords should we have the good fortune to run into the men who tortured your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to use my hands,\u201d Colm said.</p><p>\u201cEven if others have swords?\u201d</p><p>Colm gave him a hard look. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Brodick shook his head. \u201cI think you\u2019re just itching to kill someone, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am going to kill whoever did this to my brother,\u201d Colm answered.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a hope or a promise. It was a solemn vow.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>T HE COMPETITION BETWEEN BARON COSWOLD AND BARON Percy had turned deadly. Or so it seemed.</p><p>Each man went to great lengths to find out what devious schemes the other was plotting. Spies were everywhere. Certainly not all of Baron Percy\u2019s companions were loyal to him. One\u2014William, his herald in fact\u2014was secretly in the employ of Baron Coswold. The herald was a well-compensated informer who committed to memory every word said and every action taken by Percy and his conspirators, and reported back to Coswold.</p><p>When word of Laird Monroe\u2019s murder reached Percy\u2019s camp, the traitorous herald left the abbey on a false errand and rushed to give Coswold the news. The baron had made certain that William knew where he would be at all times, and the informer was therefore able to catch up with him just as he sat down to supper with Laird MacKenna in MacKenna\u2019s palatial great hall.</p><p>The terrible news didn\u2019t get the reaction William expected. Neither Coswold nor MacKenna seemed the least surprised. Coswold merely shrugged indifference and MacKenna, apparently just as unaffected, looked bored as he reached for a chunk of black bread and popped a wedge into his mouth.</p><p>Baron Percy had seemed just as uninterested when he\u2019d heard the news. Had both barons expected this to happen? Had they anticipated Monroe\u2019s death, or had they simply wished for it? And why was Laird MacKenna also indifferent? One of his own countrymen had been murdered; the herald had thought there might have been at least a hint of remorse.</p><p>Coswold pushed the chair back from the table and motioned for the herald to follow him outside. When they were alone, he ordered him to return to Percy\u2019s camp to keep his eyes and ears open for further developments.</p><p>\u201cGo now, while there is still light to guide you. You can make some of the distance back before darkness falls. I\u2019ll arrive at the abbey tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The herald watched Coswold strut back inside and then stood there a long moment scratching his head in confusion. Although he\u2019d wanted to, he didn\u2019t dare ask the baron the question plaguing him. Monroe had been a powerful, and from all accounts a well-liked, laird who was shockingly murdered in the night.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t anyone surprised?</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>B RODICK WAS IN WHOLEHEARTED AGREEMENT WITH COLM. If given the opportunity, he, too, would kill the bastards who had attacked Liam. The MacHughs were the Buchanans\u2019 allies, and their enemies were, therefore, the Buchanans\u2019 enemies as well. Over a year ago, Brodick had ventured into dangerous English territory on a mission to help his wife. The MacHughs had come to the Buchanans\u2019 aid then, and it was now the Buchanans\u2019 turn to reciprocate.</p><p>The MacHugh was a loner, though. He refused to acknowledge the benefit of having anyone other than his own clan fight by his side. Brodick used to feel the same way, and it had nearly taken a war with England to change his attitude. He now recognized the value of these ties, and he considered not only MacHugh but the Maitlands and the Sinclairs, two of the most powerful clans in the Highlands, his closest allies. These lairds had also become Brodick\u2019s good friends.</p><p>The two men did not speak for most of the ride back to the abbey. Then, urging his horse alongside Colm\u2019s, Brodick asked, \u201cDo you know how I met my wife?\u201d</p><p>An odd question, Colm thought. \u201cShe was bringing Laird Ramsey Sinclair\u2019s brother home to him,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. The boy was only five or six at the time. One of the men in the Sinclair clan thought he should have been named laird over Ramsey. He conspired to take over the clan, and he used the boy to draw Ramsey into the open with the intent of killing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you bringing this up now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps Liam was taken for the same purpose. To draw you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, twice now in the past month my soldiers protecting my border have been ambushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you lose any men?\u201d</p><p>MacHugh was insulted by the question. \u201cOf course not. My warriors are trained to expect the unexpected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the men who attacked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, none lived long enough to tell me who sent them, but they were not Highlanders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOutcasts then? Looking to steal what they could?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou heard what Liam told us. The orders were to kill as many MacHughs as possible. Outcasts would not be so organized. They thrive on chaos, and like rats they steal and run.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Tis the truth you speak,\u201d Brodick said. \u201cRamsey\u2019s brother was but a child, but Liam is a grown man. He is nearly as old as you are, is he not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive years younger but still full-grown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t he expect the unexpected? He has been trained as well as the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be asking my brother that very question as soon as he recovers his wits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoever is behind these attacks wants to be rid of all the MacHughs, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinney\u2019s Flat. That\u2019s what these attacks are about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Colm answered. \u201cMacKenna\u2019s behind this. I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have no proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacKenna is a greedy man. He wants the land for himself, and I\u2019m not going to let him have it. I could not abide having any of the MacKennas any closer to my border. The flats have always been our planting fields, and also a buffer between the MacKennas and us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKing John was gifted the land by our king years ago. He owns it until the woman he has chosen marries Laird Monroe. She brings Finney\u2019s Flat as her dowry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am aware of this pact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but are you aware that this woman is from my wife\u2019s family. Her father is Baron Geoffrey of Wellingshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou admit to having English relatives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReluctantly, I admit it. I have become more lenient in my opinions, for if you will remember, my wife used to be English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me what she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you abide having the Monroe clan to look down on from your mountain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Colm countered. \u201cCan you abide having them so close? The Buchanans border Finney\u2019s Flat on the west.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, but we have a forest of trees between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no grudge against the Monroes. As long as their laird doesn\u2019t interfere when we plant the fields on the north end of the flat, I won\u2019t mind his presence.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d reached the top of the hill above the abbey and could see the crowd of tents to the south.</p><p>\u201cThose tents belong to the English,\u201d Brodick said.</p><p>\u201cThey cannot all be here for Monroe\u2019s wedding, unless your English relatives invited them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this number,\u201d Brodick answered. \u201cMonroe wouldn\u2019t want them here, either. Nay, there must be another celebration at the abbey.\u201d</p><p>Once down the hill, they passed off their horses to Braeden and Dylan.</p><p>\u201cBe on guard,\u201d Colm said as they walked to the gates.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m always on guard,\u201d Brodick assured him. He pulled the rope to ring the bell. A moment later, a priest opened the massive wooden door.</p><p>The abbot, a shiny little man, who from the size of his belly never missed a meal, motioned them forward. He had already jumped to his own conclusions as to why the two were there.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come to offer your condolences, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Before either laird could respond, the abbot continued, \u201cYou must be terribly disappointed to have missed the funeral mass, but with the unusually mild weather it was necessary for his family to take him home and put him in the ground as quickly as possible. Did you think you might speak to the family? A pity you missed them. Shall I show you to the chapel so you might pray for his soul?\u201d</p><p>Colm and Brodick looked at each other, and then Colm turned to the abbot. Though addressing a man of God, he didn\u2019t guard his words.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>The abbot took a quick step back and patted his chest in an attempt to calm himself. He had lived a quiet, contemplative life in the monastery for years, and the excitement and turmoil of the last few days was taking its toll on his nerves.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know? I just assumed...it\u2019s Laird Monroe,\u201d he rushed on when he saw the mean look in Laird MacHugh\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s dead. Isn\u2019t that why you came here? To express your sympathy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonroe\u2019s dead?\u201d Brodick was staggered by the priest\u2019s announcement.</p><p>\u201cHow did he die?\u201d Colm wanted to know.</p><p>The abbot lowered his voice when he answered. \u201cHe was murdered.\u201d He paused to make the sign of the cross before adding, \u201cMurdered he was, and in the black of night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did this happen?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>\u201cHow was he murdered?\u201d Colm asked at the same time.</p><p>The look in the lairds\u2019 eyes frightened the abbot. Laird MacHugh seemed the more threatening of the two, angrier as well. The priest\u2019s voice trembled as he gave his answers, but he could barely keep up with the rapidly fired questions from the two giants.</p><p>Colm noticed that every time he moved, the abbot flinched. He clasped his hands behind his back as a sign of trust, so the meek abbot would know he meant him no harm.</p><p>The abbot rushed to explain. \u201cHere I was thinking you came all this way to pay your last respects, and it\u2019s apparent you didn\u2019t know about Laird Monroe\u2019s tragic death. Now I see what has happened. I\u2019ve misunderstood, haven\u2019t I? I\u2019m so sorry I greeted you with such sad news when it is clearly evident you have come here for a much more joyful occasion, the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can there be a wedding if the groom has been murdered?\u201d Brodick asked. He was beginning to think the abbot was missing part of his mind.</p><p>\u201cLaird Monroe is no longer the groom...since he\u2019s been murdered,\u201d he hastily concluded.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not here about any wedding\u2014or any funeral for that matter,\u201d Colm said. \u201cWe\u2019re here about my brother.\u201d</p><p>The abbot responded with a quizzical look. \u201cYour brother?\u201d</p><p>Colm considered grabbing the man by his neck and shaking him but knew it wouldn\u2019t be prudent to attack a man of God. From the abbot\u2019s blank stare, it was apparent he knew nothing of Liam.</p><p>The abbot was sweating profusely. He wiped his wet hands down the sides of his robe. The laird\u2019s eyes had turned a dark gray, the color of a brewing storm.</p><p>\u201cThings have been happening so fast. We\u2019re not used to this much activity in our monastery. Another match for Lady Gabrielle is just now being decided upon. It\u2019s chaos.\u201d He lowered his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. \u201cTwo barons from England are now in the great hall, each claiming to be speaking on King John\u2019s behalf. A crowd of English is gathering in the commons. I recommend that you wait upstairs if you don\u2019t want to become involved.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are the barons fighting about?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>\u201cWe need not concern ourselves with their petty squabbles,\u201d Colm said. \u201cRemember the reason we are here.\u201d He addressed the abbot once again. \u201cYou have a priest here named Gelroy. I wish to speak to him as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I inquire as to your reason for speaking to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may not.\u201d</p> <p>The abbot was taken aback by the blunt denial. Then he nodded, thinking he understood why the laird had refused to explain. \u201cOh, I see. You wish to say your confession. I apologize. I shouldn\u2019t have asked. Why don\u2019t you go on upstairs, and I\u2019ll send Father Gelroy to you. I believe I know just where he is. He\u2019ll show you the way to the chapel so that you may rid yourself of your sins.\u201d</p><p>Yet again the abbot had jumped to the wrong conclusion, but neither laird set him straight.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take any time at all,\u201d he remarked, turning to lead them to the steps.</p><p>Brodick nodded his head toward Colm. \u201cWith his number of sins, I wouldn\u2019t count on it.\u201d</p><p>Colm was not amused. He shoved Brodick out of his way. \u201cI\u2019m not here for confession. I\u2019m here for some answers about my brother. I just want to get this over and done with and get out of here. Perhaps I can convince Father Gelroy to come with us. I can\u2019t think or breathe with this many English surrounding me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt Gelroy will want to leave with us. But you can ask,\u201d Brodick said.</p><p>\u201cAsk? Why would I ask?\u201d</p><p>Brodick shrugged. Colm would do what he wanted regardless of how Brodick felt. Besides, Brodick may well have done the same had it been his own brother. Still, dragging a priest out of his sanctuary for the sole purpose of browbeating him into telling what he knew about Liam\u2019s captors...and saviors...was probably going to blacken their battered souls a little more.</p><p>The abbot was so intent on overhearing their conversation he didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d reached the top of the wall surrounding the commons. Out of breath, he pointed. \u201cHere we are.\u201d</p><p>The abbot turned to go back downstairs and fetch Gelroy, but Brodick stopped him with a question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious, Abbot. Are Baron Geoffrey and his daughter still here, or have they started back to England?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBaron Geoffrey? You know these English?\u201d</p><p>Brodick sighed. \u201cIt is an embarrassment to admit they are related...on my wife\u2019s side,\u201d he hastily added.</p><p>\u201cIt is still an embarrassment,\u201d Colm remarked.</p><p>Brodick silently reminded himself that Colm was his ally. \u201cI\u2019ve never met the daughter,\u201d he told the abbot.</p><p>The abbot replied, \u201cThe baron has left on a journey to meet with his king, and his daughter has been preparing to leave for England, but I believe she will be detained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy will she be detained?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d the abbot said. \u201cAll this chaos concerns the lady and whom she is to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs her father aware of this?\u201d Brodick wondered.</p> <p>\u201cNo. He left before the two barons came together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when is Baron Geoffrey expected to return?\u201d Though the future of Lady Gabrielle was of no concern to Brodick, he felt a gnawing obligation.</p><p>\u201cI doubt anyone has had time to send a messenger to her father. It\u2019s as though the barons deliberately waited until he was away from the abbey before springing this marriage on his daughter. They\u2019re both acting as though this is a most urgent matter. From what I\u2019ve heard of their argument, they want her married before her father finds out and causes an upset.\u201d Darting a glance to the left and then to the right he said, \u201cTrickery. Aye, it\u2019s trickery if you ask me. But the lady is protected by her guards and she is safe in our monastery. No harm will come to her while she is here.\u201d</p><p>The na\u00efve belief irritated Colm. The abbey was overrun with strangers, and most were English. How could he believe the likes of them would honor sanctuary? Even the priest Gelroy had had his doubts, for he had asked soldiers to guard Liam while he slept. Colm wondered what this jumpy abbot would think if he found out that Liam had been a guest here.</p><p>\u201cIs Lady Gabrielle agreeable to a new match?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t know yet. They\u2019ll call for her soon.\u201d Shaking his head, the abbot sighed. \u201cShe\u2019ll find out about this mischief when she answers their summons.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>B ARON COSWOLD HAD STORMED INTO THE ABBEY THAT AFTERNOON with his coterie of drones. He had quite an assemblage of sycophants trailing behind him, twenty-three in all. The large number was deliberate, for Coswold hoped to intimidate and overwhelm Percy.</p><p>Coswold felt incredibly powerful. He carried a writ proclaiming that he and he alone spoke on the king\u2019s behalf.</p><p>But Percy was neither intimidated nor overwhelmed. Like Coswold, he, too, had his spies, and although he didn\u2019t yet know about the new writ, Percy had learned that his enemy was going to try to take charge of Finney\u2019s Flat and Lady Gabrielle\u2019s future. He believed that Coswold planned to use force to get what he wanted.</p><p>Percy was ready for him. His own horde of mindless miscreants followed him as he rushed into the hall to confront Coswold. Percy wasn\u2019t about to back down or be pushed aside, and he wasn\u2019t the least concerned that he might not get what he wanted. He had a writ signed by the king that he and he alone could act on John\u2019s behalf. The king had sent him to the abbey to witness the wedding between Monroe and Gabrielle, but now that the groom was out of the way, Percy was confident that he could decide Gabrielle\u2019s future.</p><p>Each power-hungry man had a trick or two up his sleeve.</p><p>The two barons met in the center of the visitors\u2019 hall. The doors to the courtyard had been thrown open. This was not to be a private fight. Each wanted witnesses to hear.</p><p>Percy attacked first. Stabbing the air between them with a long bony finger, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare try to interfere in my decisions here or I\u2019ll have you thrown out. I speak on King John\u2019s behalf, and I am going to decide Lady Gabrielle\u2019s future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer future with you?\u201d Coswold scoffed. \u201cAnd Finney\u2019s Flat becomes yours as well? Is that what you think will happen, you fool? You most certainly will not have her. I will see to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no power, Coswold. I am going to escort the lady back to England. Aye, she goes with me.\u201d Percy didn\u2019t bother to add the important fact that he planned to force her to marry him first.</p><p>Coswold took a step closer. \u201cYou no longer speak on the king\u2019s behalf, for I have a writ signed by John giving me full power here. I will speak and act in his stead.\u201d</p><p>Percy was outraged. The veins on his forehead bulged when he responded. \u201cNay, I have the writ, and it was truly signed by King John. You cannot dupe me. I know what you want, and you will not get her.\u201d</p><p>The verbal sparring increased until both barons were ceaselessly shouting at each other. The fight moved outdoors as more and more of the curious joined the crowd.</p><p>The dividing line between the two camps was marked by a stone cross in the middle of the open lawn: Percy and his followers on one side, and Coswold and his supporters on the other.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see the writ?\u201d Coswold asked. \u201cThe king\u2019s seal is there, and so is the date, Percy. If you do not step aside, I will have you thrown out.\u201d</p><p>Percy snorted. \u201cWhen was this writ signed?\u201d he demanded, and before Coswold could answer, he added, \u201cI know where you\u2019ve been, and I know all about the dark bargain you\u2019ve struck with the laird.\u201d</p><p>Coswold ignored this comment. He snapped his fingers toward one of his supporters, and the scroll was promptly produced. He snatched it from his hands and waved it in Percy\u2019s face. \u201cHere it is. King John has assigned power to me.\u201d</p><p>Colm and Brodick rested their arms on top of a parapet, watching and listening to the debacle taking place beneath them. Colm was simply biding his time until Father Gelroy arrived. The abbot had indicated to them that it wouldn\u2019t take long to locate him, but obviously he\u2019d been mistaken.</p><p>Impatient to grab the priest and get away from these foul English barons, Colm muttered, \u201cWhere is that blasted priest Gelroy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely he\u2019s on his way,\u201d Brodick replied.</p><p>Colm scanned the crowd below. He noticed the number of ordained men in robes and said, \u201cThere are so many of them. If I knew what Gelroy looked like, I\u2019d drag him out of here.\u201d</p><p>Brodick grinned. \u201cYou know how I mentioned you can\u2019t start a war against a priest? Well, you also cannot drag one of them out of here, unless the priest is willing to go, and I doubt Gelroy would be. You and I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to my wife, we tend to frighten people.\u201d</p><p>Another shout drew their attention. \u201cThe English, they\u2019re loud, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Brodick commented. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity we don\u2019t have our bows and arrows. We could rid the world of a few of them.\u201d</p><p>Colm smiled. \u201cAye, we could.\u201d</p><p>At that moment Coswold clapped his hands for attention and bellowed, \u201cBring Lady Gabrielle to me. We will settle this here and now.\u201d He turned to the group behind him, gave a quick nod, and then turned back to face Percy. \u201cI have made my decision. By this day\u2019s end, she will be married.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>T HE ABBOT FOUND GABRIELLE STROLLING WITH FATHER Gelroy in the garden. She had already expressed her gratitude to Father Franklin and was about to give her thanks to Gelroy for keeping her confidence when the abbot rushed into the garden calling to her.</p><p>\u201cLady Gabrielle, there\u2019s a furor.\u201d Panting for breath from the exertion of running, he could barely breathe and speak at the same time.</p><p>Gabrielle led him to a stone bench and suggested that he sit for a moment.</p><p>Nodding, he plopped himself down and wheezed, \u201cAh, that\u2019s better.\u201d</p><p>Gelroy clasped his hands behind his back. \u201cYou mentioned a furor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. You have been summoned to the courtyard. Father Gelroy, perhaps you should accompany her. Such fighting. Terrible, just terrible the way they\u2019re carrying on. And inside this holy monastery of all places. Shame upon their souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is fighting?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cTwo barons from England. One is named Coswold I believe, and the other\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right, milady. Baron Percy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd these two barons have called for Gabrielle?\u201d Gelroy asked.</p><p>\u201cBaron Coswold made the demand.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle was indignant. \u201cI answer to neither of them, and I have no wish to see or speak to them. I\u2019m ready to leave for home now, and I see no reason to delay my departure.\u201d</p><p>Gelroy agreed with a quick nod. \u201cHer guards are even now bringing the horses to the front gate, for Gabrielle is planning to leave the abbey momentarily. Her possessions have already been packed.\u201d</p><p>The abbot shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think the barons will allow her to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to this than meets the eye, isn\u2019t there?\u201d Gelroy asked.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThere is. Each baron carries a writ proclaiming to be speaking and acting on the king\u2019s behalf. Coswold\u2019s writ is more current if you believe the date written down. The king\u2019s seal is on both writs, or so I\u2019ve been told.\u201d All of a sudden the abbot bounded to his feet. \u201cOh, Lord, I forgot. With all the commotion and the shouting, my errand completely slipped my mind. And how could it? With the worry about those two\u2014Father Gelroy, I was on my way to search for you when Baron Coswold called out to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were you searching for me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI promised to send you to the top of the wall. You see, there are two...\u201d He paused.</p><p>\u201cTwo? Two what?\u201d Gelroy asked.</p><p>\u201cLairds,\u201d he answered reluctantly. \u201cBuchanan and MacHugh. They didn\u2019t say why they need to speak to you, but Laird MacHugh mentioned something about his brother. Do you know anything about this?\u201d</p><p>Panic and dread flashed across Gelroy\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ve a fair idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will hear your explanation later as the lairds have been kept waiting long enough. They don\u2019t look the patient sort.\u201d He smiled as he added, \u201cI also heard one of them\u2014I believe it was MacHugh, but I can\u2019t be certain\u2014mention something about taking you away with him.\u201d</p><p>Gelroy swallowed loudly. \u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps one of them will offer you the chance to join his clan as a spiritual leader. I know you want to have your own church one day, is that not so? And you also wish to save as many souls as possible. Is that not also so?\u201d</p><p>Gelroy frantically nodded agreement. He did want his own church and his own flock\u2014what priest wouldn\u2019t?\u2014but not among these brutal lairds and their unruly clans. He didn\u2019t want to live the rest of his life in the state of perpetual terror.</p><p>\u201cI am content to pray for lost souls here, Abbot,\u201d he said in a whisper. \u201cDo you want me to escort Lady Gabrielle to face the barons, or do you want me to speak to the lairds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will go with her, and you hurry to the lairds. More and more of their clansmen have come inside. The sooner you talk to them, the better.\u201d</p><p>There was no getting out of it, Gelroy knew. \u201cBest get it done,\u201d he said.</p><p>He said his good-bye to Gabrielle one last time and left on his dreaded mission.</p><p>Gabrielle was going to continue to refuse to meet with the barons, but she abruptly changed her mind. She didn\u2019t want to put the abbot in the awkward position of having to explain why she ignored the summons.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see what the barons want, and then I\u2019ll leave the abbey with all possible haste. Abbot, I would like to thank you once again for your hospitality and your kindness to my father and me. We are most appreciative.\u201d</p><p>She began to walk around the abbot to go to the commons, but he blocked her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to escort you, milady, but shouldn\u2019t we wait for your guards? They would certainly want to stand by your side when you speak to these barons.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cMy guards are too busy to be bothered with this nonsense, and I\u2019m certain the meeting won\u2019t take any time at all.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t dissuade her. Gabrielle had another reason for keeping her guards away from the barons. Her father didn\u2019t trust these men, and neither would she. She was concerned that Coswold and Percy might have their underlings provoke a fight, and though her guards were well-trained, they could be overwhelmed by the sheer number of men attacking. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She did wish her father was by her side, though. He knew what these men were capable of, and he would know what to expect. She tried to think of the worst that could happen so that she would be prepared, but never in her wildest thoughts could she have imagined what was coming.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</p><p>G ELROY DRAGGED HIS FEET AND PRAYED HIS WAY UP THE stairs. When he reached the last step and took a good look around, his knees buckled. He had to lean against the wall to keep from tumbling backward.</p><p>Good Lord, there were so many of them! And all were watching him.</p> <p>His voice sounded like the squeak of a rusty door hinge when he called out, \u201cDid someone wish to speak to me?\u201d</p><p>Two Highlanders were coming his way. Their long strides quickly consumed the distance between them. Gelroy clung to the wall and waited. Someone gave him a push from the rear. Startled, the priest turned. Another Highlander was standing on the stairs behind him. How had the man gotten there so quickly?</p><p>\u201cYou are the priest Gelroy?\u201d a booming voice at the top of the stairs asked.</p><p>He looked up again. The two giants stood side by side. They were of equal height, and both wore the scars of their past. Gelroy took a tentative step toward them. \u201cI am Father Gelroy.\u201d</p><p>Brodick noticed the priest was twitching and rapidly losing the color in his face. \u201cWe mean you no harm, priest,\u201d he said in an attempt to help Gelroy get over his scare.</p> <p>\u201cI am Laird MacHugh,\u201d Colm said.</p><p>Gelroy nodded. \u201cYes, you resemble your brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I am Laird Buchanan.\u201d</p><p>The priest managed a bit of a smile as he looked up at Brodick. \u201cYes, I know. You are the wild Buchanan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d He was too surprised to be angry.</p><p>\u201cShe calls you the wild Buchanan.\u201d</p> <p>Brodick raised an eyebrow. \u201cWho calls me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Gabrielle,\u201d he answered. \u201cDon\u2019t you know who she is?\u201d He rushed on, \u201cShe\u2019s the daughter of Baron Geoffrey of Wellingshire, and they are your family through your wife.\u201d</p><p>Brodick\u2019s pleasant mood was ruined. He felt as though he was constantly being reminded that he had English relatives. It was damned humiliating.</p><p>\u201cI have questions to put to you,\u201d Colm said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my understanding that you tended to my brother when he was brought here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t tend to him, for I have never learned the ways of healing. It was Father Franklin who tended to Liam, but I helped as much as I could. His injuries were severe, and for a time, I\u2019m ashamed to admit, I didn\u2019t think he would survive.\u201d</p><p>Colm nodded. \u201cWho brought him here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI cannot say.\u201d</p><p>Colm tilted his head and stared at Gelroy for several seconds. \u201cYou cannot or you will not?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cCannot.\u201d Gelroy was able to look directly into the laird\u2019s eyes because he was telling the truth. He couldn\u2019t say. He had promised Lady Gabrielle that he would hold her secret, and he could not break his word to her. He didn\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t want anyone to know that she and her guards had helped Liam, but he would respect her wishes.</p><p>The questions continued, but Gelroy knew that Laird MacHugh didn\u2019t believe he was telling him everything because he kept circling back to the same question: How had Liam gotten to the abbey?</p><p>\u201cDid anyone else see Liam being carried inside?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t believe so, and I did my best to keep his presence secret.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you lift him and carry him in, priest?\u201d Colm folded his arms across his chest and waited for his answer.</p><p>Gelroy was feeling sick to his stomach. What was he going to do? In order to protect the promise he\u2019d made, he would have to lie to the laird. What a mess. He wished he had time to talk to his confessor, for he didn\u2019t have any idea what kind of sin he was about to commit. Was it a mild infraction that would be considered a venial sin, or was it far more damning because a priest was telling the lie? Could it be a mortal sin then? No, surely not. Gelroy thought he would have to do something much more serious, like kill a man, to make a mortal spot on his soul. Still, a sin was a sin.</p><p>Gelroy was sinking in a quagmire, and he saw no way out.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you say if I told you I might have lifted him and carried him inside?\u201d</p><p>Colm looked at Brodick. \u201cIs he jesting?\u201d</p><p>Brodick shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Gelroy asked, \u201cWhat if I were to tell you I cannot remember?\u201d</p><p>Colm let the priest see his annoyance. \u201cYou cannot remember lifting a man who weighs at least twice as much as you do? You cannot remember that amazing feat?\u201d</p><p>Gelroy bowed his head. He gave up trying to be clever. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Laird, but I cannot tell you anything more. I have given my word to keep silent, and I must keep it.\u201d</p><p>Colm was furious. \u201cDid you give your word to the men who tried to kill my brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not, and I have no idea who those terrible men are. I would not hold their secrets unless they came to me in confession.\u201d He hastily put his hands up. \u201cAnd none of them did confess to me. I swear to you I know nothing about them. I don\u2019t even know what happened to your brother. I only saw the result of the punishment they inflicted.\u201d</p><p>Brodick was distracted by the noise from the courtyard. A Buchanan warrior called to him. \u201cThere\u2019s trouble below.\u201d</p><p>One of MacHugh\u2019s men looked down at the people assembled below. \u201cYou should see this,\u201d he told Colm.</p><p>\u201cWhy do I care about the English and their troubles?\u201d Brodick asked as he strode to the parapet.</p><p>\u201cBaron Geoffrey\u2019s daughter is at the heart of the trouble.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</p><p>G ABRIELLE LED THE WAY TO THE COMMONS. SHE WAS DETERMINED to end this meeting and be on her way home as quickly as possible. The abbot followed as she hurried up the small knoll past the monks\u2019 sleeping quarters and around the smaller chapel adjacent to the baking house. She was about to enter the commons through an archway when she noticed a woman standing in the shadows watching her. Gabrielle instinctively smiled and nodded a greeting, but the woman did not respond in kind. There was loathing in her expression, and her ferretlike eyes glowed with hatred.</p><p>Gabrielle was so taken aback, she abruptly stopped. Although she had never met the woman before, she had a fair idea who she was. Such a vile reaction could only come from a Monroe. Her father had told her that most of the Monroe clan blamed her for their laird\u2019s death. The ridiculous idea made no sense to her, and she considered saying something to the woman and pointing out that her attitude was most unreasonable, but before she could speak, the strange woman picked up her skirts and ran away.</p><p>The abbot caught up with Gabrielle in time to see what had happened. \u201cDo you know that woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she replied. \u201cShe seemed most upset, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, she did. Upset with you from the look she was wearing on her face.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle nodded. \u201cShe must be a Monroe because the Monroes dislike me intensely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Lady Gabrielle, that isn\u2019t so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d she asked, a bit relieved. The idea of an entire clan hating her was upsetting. \u201cThe Monroes don\u2019t hate me?\u201d she asked eagerly.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, they do. They most certainly do,\u201d he answered matter-of-factly, sounding almost cheerful. \u201cBut you see, that woman isn\u2019t a Monroe. I can\u2019t recall her name, but I remember being introduced to her, and I believe she\u2019s related to one of the barons. With all the strangers I\u2019ve met in the past few days, I can\u2019t keep all of them straight in my head. These English all tend to look alike.\u201d</p><p>Lovely, she thought. The Monroes\u2019 hatred had spilled all the way down to England.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t allow myself to be concerned about their foolish opinions.\u201d</p><p>The abbot gestured toward the passage into the courtyard. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we continue on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Gabrielle agreed. \u201cBut you needn\u2019t come with me. I\u2019m certain you have more important matters to attend to, and I don\u2019t want you to waste another minute worrying about me. I prefer to face the barons alone.\u201d</p><p>She stepped through a short hallway and found herself in the middle of a dogfight. It was difficult for her to locate the two barons because the area was filled with people, everyone in the assembled crowd trying to shout louder than everyone else. It was pandemonium. Something urgent must be happening, she thought, to provoke such vehement arguing. She drew back into the shadows, waiting for the noise to die down.</p><p>She searched the crowd for the two barons, and when she happened to look up, her breath caught in her throat and she nearly lost her balance. Liam\u2019s brother stood looking down from the top of the wall. He now appeared even larger and more menacing than the first time she had seen him on the hill. It wasn\u2019t just his size that made Colm MacHugh so intimidating but his rigid stance and his stony expression. He was the most fearsome man she had ever seen.</p><p>The laird next to him was also a daunting figure. She recognized him as well. This was the wild Buchanan.</p><p>Concerned that she would lose what courage she had if she continued to stare at the two Highlanders, she turned her attention back to the fighting throng in front of her.</p><p>Suddenly one man noticed her, then another and another, and within seconds a hush had fallen over the crowd.</p><p>Baron Coswold spotted her before Percy did. He bowed low and held out his hand to bid her to come forward.</p><p>\u201cLady Gabrielle, it is so good of you to join us. We\u2019ve met before in King John\u2019s court. I\u2019m sure you remember me, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle didn\u2019t acknowledge Coswold\u2019s question. She simply looked at him and waited for him to explain the purpose of the meeting.</p><p>\u201cI speak on the king\u2019s behalf,\u201d he stammered, unnerved by her silence.</p><p>She walked toward him, and the baron silently cursed himself for the devil pact he had made with MacKenna. What had he been thinking? How could he give her to another man? Since he\u2019d last seen her, she\u2019d grown even more beautiful.</p><p>Everyone remained quiet as the lady made her way to the center of the courtyard.</p><p>Colm MacHugh had been watching the melee unfolding below him with both amusement and disgust. What asses the English were, arguing over who had the right to speak. When the screaming suddenly subsided, he wondered what could have quieted their absurd tirade. And then he saw her. She moved through the crowd with her head held high and her hands at her sides.</p><p>Baron Percy broke the silence. \u201cMy lady, I can see you don\u2019t remember Coswold,\u201d he said, a snicker in his voice. \u201cWe have also met before, when you were presented to King John.\u201d</p><p>Percy knew better than to ask her if she remembered meeting him, for he had the feeling that he would get the same cold, silent response she\u2019d given Coswold.</p><p>\u201cAnd Coswold is mistaken,\u201d Percy continued. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t speak on the king\u2019s behalf. I do.\u201d</p><p>The statement was the spark that once again ignited the fiery argument.</p><p>Coswold waved a document in the air. \u201cI have a writ signed by King John giving me his power to decide your future. Percy\u2019s writ is no longer valid. The date marked by the king, later than Percy\u2019s worthless paper, proves that I am in charge.\u201d</p><p>Percy wasn\u2019t about to let the woman slip through his fingers. \u201cAs is his habit, Baron Coswold speaks nonsense. I have already decided that since Laird Monroe is dead, you will return to England with me. We shall let King John decide your future.\u201d</p><p>Coswold turned to Percy. \u201cEveryone here knows what you\u2019re planning. You plan to wed the lady before you leave the abbey, but she isn\u2019t going anywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will have her!\u201d Percy screamed.</p><p>Gabrielle could hardly believe her ears. Were they both mad? They sickened her. How dare they fight over her as though she were a piece of meat thrown to ravenous dogs? She knew she couldn\u2019t be that important to either of them. Nay, it was Finney\u2019s Flat they were after. Both barons wanted the valuable land.</p><p>Several MacHugh and Buchanan men joined their lairds at the wall to observe the commotion in the courtyard, but Colm\u2019s gaze was fixed on the woman at the center of the storm. He wondered what was going on inside her mind. Gabrielle hid her feelings well. Her regal bearing and her composure impressed him.</p><p>Coswold clapped his hands to regain everyone\u2019s attention. He then turned to the group of men behind him, gave a quick nod, and said, \u201cI\u2019ll settle this here and now.\u201d</p><p>The crowd parted, and Laird Owen MacKenna stepped forward. He nodded to several men as he passed them. Looking up at the top of the wall, he saw MacHugh and Buchanan watching him, and stiffened in reaction.</p><p>\u201cLook who just crawled out from under his rock,\u201d Brodick said. \u201cIt\u2019s our old friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe arrogant swine,\u201d Colm scoffed.</p><p>Baron Percy did not know Laird MacKenna. \u201cWho is this man who dares to interrupt this proceeding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Laird MacKenna, and I have agreed to marry Lady Gabrielle and accept her dowry. From this day forward, Finney\u2019s Flat will be called Glen MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>Coswold wore a smug look. \u201cAye, Finney\u2019s Flat will be yours.\u201d</p><p>Up above, Colm reacted with a start. \u201cThe hell it will.\u201d</p><p>Brodick straightened. \u201cNo, we can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d He looked at Gabrielle and wondered why she hadn\u2019t protested the barons\u2019 high-handed methods. Was she flattered or insulted? If she were anything like her father, she was railing inside, Brodick thought.</p><p>MacKenna approached Gabrielle with a warm smile. She didn\u2019t return the smile. She seemed to be looking through him, and MacKenna thought she must be overwhelmed by all the attention she was receiving. After all, she was about to be married to a powerful laird. Aye, far more powerful than poor dead Monroe could have hoped to be. And MacKenna was much more handsome. Women liked attractive men. Perhaps her good fortune just hadn\u2019t sunk in yet.</p><p>\u201cLaird MacKenna and Lady Gabrielle will be married before this day ends,\u201d Coswold called out.</p><p>Another shout from behind the throng of people interrupted his proclamation. \u201cMacKenna, you have no right to her. I am Harold Monroe, and I will soon become laird of the Monroe clan. It is my duty and my right to marry this woman. My right by primogeniture.\u201d</p><p>The throng stepped aside to let him through. Gabrielle recognized the man. He had been with the spiteful woman at the funeral. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As Monroe made his way to them, MacKenna challenged him. \u201cYou are not the firstborn son of Laird Monroe. He had no sons. You, therefore, cannot claim primogeniture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am his brother\u2019s firstborn son,\u201d he shouted. \u201cAnd since my uncle is now deceased, I claim Lady Gabrielle and Finney\u2019s Flat for myself. From this day forward, the land will be called Glen Monroe.\u201d</p><p>Coswold was determined to take control again. \u201cYou can demand all you want, but you aren\u2019t getting her, nor are you getting Finney\u2019s Flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlen MacKenna,\u201d MacKenna corrected. \u201cAs of today, it\u2019s Glen MacKenna.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat deceit is this?\u201d Percy hissed at Coswold. \u201cWhat kind of a pact have you made with this man? Does he know you want her for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a fool, Percy, a damn fool.\u201d</p><p>Neither one was going to get her, Coswold had realized. He\u2019d given up the possibility of marrying Gabrielle. The king had put one obstacle after another in his path, and as lustful as Coswold was for Gabrielle, he wanted the gold every bit as much. Aye, he lusted after the treasure. And so he had made his deal with MacKenna. The laird would get her and the land, and in return Coswold would have access to her. He was convinced she had knowledge of St. Biel\u2019s treasure, and, whether with charm or with torture, he would get it out of her.</p><p>Fortunately for him, Percy didn\u2019t even know the treasure existed and neither did MacKenna or King John. MacKenna was such a greedy pig, he hadn\u2019t shown any curiosity when Coswold insisted that he be able to see Gabrielle whenever he wanted. All the laird was interested in was controlling Finney\u2019s Flat.</p><p>Coswold wasn\u2019t worried that MacKenna might not live up to his part of the bargain. If necessary, Coswold could summon enough soldiers to destroy the entire MacKenna clan.</p> <p>Harold Monroe wasn\u2019t about to go away quietly. He had to scream to be heard over the chaos that had erupted. \u201cI claim the right to marry the lady and be given Glen Monroe!\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the crowd seemed to have an opinion and decided to express it.</p><p>Coswold raised his hand for silence. The command was ignored.</p><p>\u201cQuiet, everyone! Baron Coswold wants quiet now so he can be heard.\u201d In an attempt to be helpful, Henry Willis, one of Coswold\u2019s henchmen, shouted the demand from directly behind Coswold\u2019s back. He added several obscene curses as well when the crowd didn\u2019t immediately obey.</p><p>At the sound of Henry\u2019s voice, Coswold flinched, then whirled around to glare at the offender.</p><p>\u201cDo not scream in my ear,\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>Henry gritted his teeth. He didn\u2019t like being corrected in front of an audience, and he especially didn\u2019t like disappointing the baron. Coswold was his liberator. He\u2019d liberated him from a trip to the gallows, and Henry idolized him, for the baron had given him an identity and made him an important man.</p><p>Henry knew what he was. In appearance he certainly wasn\u2019t much to look at. He was a wide-necked brute of a man with a flat face, small ears, and thick lips. His eyes were no bigger than two beads of perspiration. His hands were big though. Big and strong. Perhaps because he knew he was so unattractive, he wore a perpetual sneer.</p><p>He made up for his unpleasant appearance with his special talents. He could snap a man\u2019s neck quicker than he could drop to his knees, and he would do so without any provocation or a moment\u2019s remorse. There were only a handful of men in the world he feared, and Coswold was one. Henry knew that Coswold used him and his cohorts, Cyril and Malcolm, to do his unpleasant work, but they were well-paid and given respect by the baron\u2019s peers.</p><p>Henry heard Malcolm snicker and shoved an elbow in his side. Since Coswold was still glaring at him, Henry said, \u201cI won\u2019t be yelling again, but Baron,\u201d he continued in a rush to redeem himself, \u201cmaybe if you used force, you\u2019d get them to do what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>Coswold was exasperated. \u201cWe had to leave our weapons outside the gates, remember? Oh, to have my sword now. I\u2019d run it through Percy just to shut him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be honored to run him through for you,\u201d Malcolm blurted. The hireling only came to Henry\u2019s shoulder and had to push his way to the front so he could be seen by the baron.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you were to bring more of your people inside the abbey? Even without weapons they\u2019d be giving Percy a message of how powerful you are. Besides, look at those Highlanders strolling in here as if they owned the place. I lost count, there are so many of them,\u201d Henry said.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t important and have no interest in this proceeding. I certainly have no interest in them. Now both of you be quiet while I finish this. I have no need for more of your suggestions.\u201d</p> <p>Both Malcolm and Henry bowed their heads. \u201cAye, Baron.\u201d</p><p>Percy strained to hear the conversation between Coswold and his men, but the clamor of voices surrounding him drowned them out. When Coswold turned back to him, he screamed, \u201cYou will not decide anything!\u201d</p><p>Percy screeched like a trapped bird, Coswold thought. \u201cI have already decided her future.\u201d</p><p>Percy\u2019s face turned bloodred. \u201cI want her and I will have her.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle had had enough. She couldn\u2019t bear to hear another word from either of these repulsive men.</p><p>\u201cMay I have your attention?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle had not raised her voice, and only a few men standing near her heard what she said. One of them yelled, \u201cThe lady is wanting your attention, Baron.\u201d</p><p>Coswold and Percy both turned to her. MacKenna stood between them. All three smiled at her like starry-eyed suitors.</p><p>\u201cWhich baron do you wish to address?\u201d Percy cooed.</p><p>\u201cBoth.\u201d</p><p>Everyone eagerly waited for her to speak. She would surely choose one over the other, and Coswold was confident that she would obey the king\u2019s writ and abide by his decisions. Percy held the same view, confident she would place her future in his hands.</p><p>\u201cYes, Lady Gabrielle?\u201d Coswold said.</p><p>\u201cThere seems to be some confusion here,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cAye, with all the shouting Percy\u2019s doing,\u201d Coswold interrupted.</p><p>\u201cLet her speak!\u201d someone from the crowd shouted.</p><p>\u201cAll right. All right.\u201d Coswold nodded. \u201cYou were saying, milady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe I can settle this dispute. You see, I will not marry anyone today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have agreed to marry you,\u201d MacKenna said, staggered by her refusal.</p><p>\u201cYes, but I have not agreed to marry you.\u201d</p><p>His mouth dropped open. He was astounded and turned to Coswold for help. \u201cCan she refuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe cannot,\u201d he snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t be difficult, Gabrielle, for I speak on King John\u2019s behalf...\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle was weary of their pompous declarations. \u201cYes, you\u2019ve mentioned that fact several times now.\u201d</p><p>Did she mock him? Coswold\u2019s eyes narrowed. He couldn\u2019t be certain. She looked so angelic, and there was no bite to her voice.</p><p>\u201cBaron Coswold is mistaken. I speak for the king,\u201d Percy insisted.</p><p>She turned her attention to him. \u201cSo you have also said countless times. May I ask both of you a question? Where was my father while all of these decisions were being made?\u201d</p><p>No one would answer.</p><p>\u201cDid you wait for my father to leave to carry out this obscenity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObscenity?\u201d Coswold roared. \u201cHow dare you speak to me in such a way.\u201d</p><p>Percy was just as outraged by her attitude, and MacKenna looked like he wanted to strike her, but she held her ground and budged not one inch.</p><p>MacKenna considered grabbing Gabrielle by her arm and forcing her to his side, but he looked up and saw MacHugh and Buchanan still watching. Best not touch her, he decided, for he had no wish to make a scene. For the time being, he was forced to treat her with courtesy. Later, he promised himself, when he had Gabrielle alone, he would show her how to be respectful.</p><p>\u201cLady Gabrielle, I am afraid this isn\u2019t your decision to make,\u201d Percy told her.</p><p>\u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>Coswold and Percy glanced at each other. \u201cYou agree?\u201d Coswold said. \u201cThen why this fuss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t my decision. It\u2019s my father\u2019s. It\u2019s his right to decide my future, certainly not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you refusing...\u201d MacKenna began.</p><p>Lord, he was as thickheaded as both barons appeared to be. She held herself even straighter. \u201cLet me make my position clear so that there will be no more confusion. My father will decide my future.\u201d</p><p>How many times would she have to say it before they believed she meant every word? She wasn\u2019t going to marry anyone today.</p><p>\u201cYou would go against your king\u2019s wishes?\u201d Percy demanded.</p><p>She looked him in the eye. \u201cI know not what my king\u2019s wishes are. He has yet to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just told you that I speak on his behalf,\u201d Percy cried.</p><p>\u201cYes, you have, but then so has Baron Coswold. Who am I to believe? I think I must wait for my father to decide.\u201d</p><p>She bowed to the barons and had every intention of leaving, but a woman\u2019s sudden shout stopped her.</p><p>\u201cThis is a mockery. A mockery! She\u2019s making fools of all of you. This cannot go on.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle turned to see the woman who had glared at her outside the commons make her way toward them.</p><p>Isla ran to Coswold. He looked horrified by the intrusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he hissed under his breath.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look at him. Lowering her head, Isla cried out, \u201cPray forgive me for not speaking out sooner, but I couldn\u2019t...it\u2019s...it\u2019s so horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is this woman?\u201d a man in Percy\u2019s group asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Baron Coswold\u2019s niece,\u201d Percy answered.</p><p>\u201cIsla, what\u2019s come over you?\u201d Appalled by her behavior, Coswold grabbed Isla\u2019s arm, squeezing as hard as he could. What was she thinking to make such a scene?</p><p>\u201cUncle, I\u2019m so sorry to upset you, but the truth must come out before you or Baron Percy decide her future. I will not let her humiliate you.\u201d Although there were no tears in evidence, Isla let out a loud dramatic sob. \u201cIt would be blasphemy for an honorable man to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What are you saying?\u201d Percy demanded. He sounded more confused than angry. \u201cWhat blasphemy do you speak of?\u201d</p><p>Isla pointed to Gabrielle and screamed, \u201cShe\u2019s unclean. She\u2019s...she\u2019s a whore!\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</p><p>T HE DAMNING SILENCE THAT FOLLOWED ISLA\u2019S HORRIBLE accusation lasted only as long as it took for everyone in the commons to draw a deep, gasping breath. Then the crowd erupted into bursts of anger and outrage. Within minutes, sides were taken, those for and those against Gabrielle.</p><p>Gabrielle couldn\u2019t move. How could she respond to such an absurdity? It was preposterous.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hear what she has to say.\u201d Percy waved his arms and demanded the crowd quiet down.</p><p>Coswold\u2019s voice shook with fury. \u201cYes, everyone be silent now. I would hear what Isla has to say for herself.\u201d His niece was ruining all of his carefully thought out plans, but all eyes were on her now, and he couldn\u2019t ignore her. \u201cIsla, why would you call the Lady Gabrielle such a foul name?\u201d</p><p>Isla timidly glanced up and saw that everyone was closing in on her. \u201cBecause it\u2019s true,\u201d she answered in a meek voice.</p><p>\u201cSpeak up,\u201d Percy said. \u201cTell us why you made this outrageous claim.\u201d</p><p>Isla raised her voice slightly and repeated, \u201cBecause it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Murmurs spread through the crowd.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know this?\u201d Percy demanded.</p><p>\u201cI saw her,\u201d Isla said.</p><p>The murmurs grew louder.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Coswold ordered. \u201cTell us what you saw.\u201d</p><p>It was easy for Isla to cry real tears now. Her uncle had such a tight grip on her arm, her skin was burning.</p><p>\u201cIt was the middle of the night three nights ago, and I was awakened by a noise in the hall. I opened my door to see what it was.\u201d She pointed to Gabrielle. \u201cShe was sneaking around the corner. I knew I shouldn\u2019t, but I was curious and decided to follow her. I stayed well behind her because I didn\u2019t want her to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you see where you were going in the dark? Did the lady carry a candle?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for the barest of seconds and then blurted, \u201cThe moon was bright. There was no need for a candle.\u201d</p><p>She struggled to get away from her uncle, but he wouldn\u2019t release her. In fact, he tightened his hold.</p><p>\u201cWhere did Lady Gabrielle lead you?\u201d MacKenna asked the question.</p><p>\u201cShe stopped in front of a door and tapped lightly. I hid behind a pillar. The door opened, and after looking both ways, she went inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see who opened the door?\u201d Percy asked.</p><p>Isla dropped her gaze to the ground again. \u201cIt was a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you know this man?\u201d her uncle asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Isla said, \u201cbut I had seen him at the banquet that night. I believe he was the envoy from France.\u201d</p><p>Percy called to his followers. \u201cFind him. Bring him to us.\u201d</p><p>One of them answered immediately. \u201cHe\u2019s no longer here. He and his companions left yesterday.\u201d</p><p>MacKenna grew impatient. \u201cIf it was dark, how could you recognize the man?\u201d he asked Isla. \u201cPerhaps it was her father. Perhaps it wasn\u2019t a man at all, but a maidservant.\u201d He was grasping for an explanation. If Isla\u2019s accusations were taken seriously, his entire scheme would be destroyed. He could feel Glen MacKenna slipping through his fingers.</p><p>Isla\u2019s courage was gaining strength. \u201cIt was a man,\u201d she stated emphatically. Pointing at Gabrielle again, she said, \u201cAnd what she was doing makes her unclean.\u201d</p><p>MacKenna scanned the crowd as everyone reacted to the shocking news. When he looked up, he saw MacHugh and Buchanan watching with scowls on their faces. His mind raced. How much had they heard? Once again, his reputation and his authority were at stake. If he was going to emerge from this situation with his dignity and his plan intact, he had to think fast.</p><p>He looked at Isla with mock compassion when he said, \u201cI\u2019m sure your intentions are noble, but perhaps you are mistaken, my dear. Is it possible that you could have confused what you saw for something innocent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was no mistake,\u201d Isla said defiantly. \u201cI saw her when she came out of the room. Her hair was down and her gown was unlaced. The man came to the door, and he wore no tunic or shirt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gabrielle was so shocked by the woman\u2019s absurd claims, she was speechless. At this last hideous allegation, however, she could remain silent no longer.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lie!\u201d she shouted. \u201cI don\u2019t know why this woman is saying these things, but nothing she\u2019s told you is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is true!\u201d Isla shouted back. \u201cI saw you, and you were giving yourself to a man.\u201d</p><p>An uproar swelled among the onlookers. It took MacKenna several minutes to get them to calm down so that he could be heard.</p> <p>\u201cIt appears,\u201d he said to Isla, \u201cthat this is your word against Lady Gabrielle\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Almost everyone in the crowd nodded agreement. Only a few people knew Baron Coswold\u2019s niece, so her words held little credence with most.</p><p>Suddenly, a man standing behind Laird MacKenna spoke up. \u201cThe woman speaks the truth.\u201d</p><p>Everyone turned toward the voice. A young monk with his head covered by his hood and his arms folded inside the sleeves of his robe slowly moved forward.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d MacKenna questioned. \u201cWho is telling the truth? What do you know of this?\u201d</p> <p>Unaccustomed to having so much attention paid to him, the monk hesitated a moment before answering, then said, \u201cLady Isla is being truthful. I know this because I, too, saw Lady Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>The circle at the stone cross expanded so that everyone could see and hear the monk. He took a tentative step forward then halted as though he suddenly realized the magnitude of his actions.</p><p>\u201cI saw the lady...\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Percy demanded impatiently.</p><p>\u201cI had just come out of the chapel at midnight after my hour of adoration and I saw someone hurrying toward the sleeping quarters where a few of the guests were staying. At first I saw only a dark figure, but as she passed under the candlelight shining from the chapel window, I recognized Lady Gabrielle.\u201d He looked over at the astonished Isla and said, \u201cLady Isla is not lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a whore!\u201d someone behind Percy shouted.</p> <p>\u201cUnfit to marry anyone!\u201d a member of the Monroe clan yelled.</p><p>Before long, dozens of angry voices joined together in condemning her.</p><p>Gabrielle was numb. She felt as though she\u2019d just been thrown over a cliff and the wolves were waiting at the bottom to tear her apart. She had been judged and damned.</p><p>She tried to make sense out of the insanity. How could this be happening? How could people be saying such vile things about her? Isla had to be demented to be making such ludicrous accusations. But what of the monk? Why did he agree with Isla? What could possibly make him confirm that Gabrielle had done these wicked deeds?</p><p>Liam. Dear God, it was Liam. Maybe the monk had seen her on her way to look in on the sick man. But she was never alone when she left her rooms. At least one guard accompanied her, but if he had stepped ahead and the monk happened to look up just as she was walking past, he might have assumed she was alone. That could be the only explanation.</p><p>If she tried to defend herself, tried to tell the truth, no one would believe she was simply visiting a sick man and nothing improper had happened.</p><p>Two people had accused her. And that was enough to prove her guilt.</p><p>\u201cHave you nothing to say for yourself?\u201d Coswold shouted at Gabrielle.</p> <p>She refused to answer. The incensed crowd had already passed judgment.</p><p>She had given her word that she would tell no one about her part in saving Liam, and even if she hadn\u2019t promised, what would the reaction of the mob be if they knew that she was responsible for killing a man at Finney\u2019s Flat? Who would turn against her and her guards then? She could neither do nor say anything that would end this nightmare. Tears flooded her eyes, but she would not let them spill down her cheeks. She would not respond to the slurs these people were hurling at her.</p><p>Baron Coswold\u2019s anger toward his niece subsided, and he released his grip on her arm. Isla\u2019s motives for coming forward were now clear to him. She was only trying to save him from the humiliation that would surely come when the truth about Lady Gabrielle was revealed, for inevitably it would be known. Even if the monk stayed silent and never uttered a word about her sin, surely Baron MacKenna would be enraged when he discovered his new bride was not a virgin. No, Isla may not have chosen the most appropriate time to speak up, but she was only trying to protect him.</p><p>The turmoil over Gabrielle\u2019s future had suddenly shifted. Just moments ago four men had been vying for her hand, but with this revelation everything had changed. For who among them would step forward to accept her now? Who would take a harlot as a wife?</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</p><p>C OSWOLD WAS ENRAGED. IT WAS TRUE. IT WAS ALL TRUE. Gabrielle was a whore. She had tricked him. She\u2019d tricked them all into believing she was pure. Her appearance made it so easy for her to dupe men. Her angelic face and those eyes, those bewitching violet eyes...she was so beautiful. What man would even consider that she might be anything but innocent?</p><p>What a fool he had been to want her. How many men had she given herself to? It made him sick to think about it.</p><p>Coswold looked at Percy to see how he was taking the news. A look of horror seemed frozen on his face. His mouth was open as though he were about to speak, but he uttered not one word.</p><p>Even if he had said something, he wouldn\u2019t have been heard over MacKenna\u2019s roar. The laird was ranting about his good name and the shame Gabrielle would have brought to it. With each statement in his tirade, he\u2019d look up at the wall. Did he expect the Highlanders watching to applaud his refusal to marry Gabrielle?</p><p>\u201cShe has no value now,\u201d Percy said when MacKenna paused to take a breath. \u201cKing John won\u2019t give her a dowry. Finney\u2019s Flat is no longer yours for the taking, MacKenna. The same goes for you, Monroe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I still want her?\u201d Monroe spat on the ground in front of Gabrielle. \u201cThe devil take her.\u201d He turned and walked away. As he passed MacKenna, he said, \u201cShe\u2019s all yours, MacKenna, as long as you don\u2019t mind the mocking behind your back. You heard the baron. You can have the whore, but you won\u2019t be getting Finney\u2019s Flat.\u201d</p><p>MacKenna had never felt so humiliated. His wrath turned on Coswold. \u201cDid you know she was a whore when you struck your bargain with me? You did, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Indignant, Coswold responded, \u201cI most certainly did not. I believed her to be innocent, as everyone else did. I knew you wanted Finney\u2019s Flat. You were already calling the land Glen MacKenna before I even suggested the bargain, and I wanted\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped in the middle of his sentence before he accidentally blurted out the promise he\u2019d forced MacKenna to give to seal the bargain.</p><p>MacKenna didn\u2019t want anyone to know the particulars of their agreement. He pulled Coswold aside and turned his back to the others. \u201cYou demanded that I agree to let you see her whenever you wanted, but you refused to explain why. Tell me, were you one of the men she\u2019d already given herself to? Were you planning to continue to bed her? Was she your mistress?\u201d</p><p>With each question he posed, his complexion turned a darker shade of purple.</p><p>Coswold had almost forgotten about the gold. Gabrielle\u2019s shocking conduct had pushed every other thought aside. Coswold didn\u2019t want her any longer, but he was still determined to get the treasure. His mind raced for a solution. If he was ever going to find out where the treasure was hidden, he needed access to Gabrielle, but if he took her back to King John, she would be lost to him. The king would probably be so furious he\u2019d order her execution, and if he were in one of his rare forgiving moods, he would most likely use her until he became bored and then pass her on to his favored underlings. Either way, Coswold wouldn\u2019t be able to see her.</p><p>Percy wasn\u2019t as worried. While he would have preferred to have Gabrielle in marriage, he was prepared to take her as his mistress. His obsession did not require a public ceremony. If Gabrielle were banished, she would be free for the taking, and he could have her whenever and however he wanted. All he had to do was wait until Coswold washed his hands of her.</p><p>Coswold had devised a plan, too, and knew exactly what he would do. He had to act quickly because Gabrielle was still in a state of shock. He feared that she would react with a vengeance and perhaps even try to escape to her father for protection. He couldn\u2019t let that happen.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a waste of my time to take the woman back to England and wait for King John to return. Since I speak on his behalf, I will decide her fate this very minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not kill her,\u201d Percy shouted.</p><p>Isla\u2019s hand flew to her chest. \u201cWhy do you care what happens to her?\u201d she cried. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly still want her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you shut her up, Coswold? No one wants to hear anything more from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe silent,\u201d Coswold ordered as he shoved Isla away from him. \u201cPercy\u2019s right. You\u2019ve said enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean what I say, Coswold,\u201d Percy warned. \u201cYou cannot kill Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>Coswold sneered at his adversary. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t kill her. I want her to suffer for the rest of her life, however short that might be.\u201d</p><p>He turned his full attention to Gabrielle then and took a step toward her. The crowd gave him a wide berth.</p><p>\u201cWith the power bestowed on me by King John, I hereby banish you.\u201d</p><p>The assemblage cheered the punishment. Some clapped, others shouted approval. \u201cGood riddance.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s getting what she deserves.\u201d</p><p>Coswold waited for everyone to settle down before he continued.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand what this means, Gabrielle? From this moment on, you are an outcast. You have no home, no country, no king, and no title. King John and his faithful subjects no longer acknowledge your existence. You are nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she answer to the king?\u201d someone shouted.</p><p>\u201cShe does not, for she has no king,\u201d Coswold answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Baron Geoffrey?\u201d Percy asked. \u201cDon\u2019t you wonder what he\u2019ll do when he hears his daughter has been banished?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the time he finds out, it will be too late.\u201d</p><p>Percy was desperately trying not to show his joy. Gabrielle would be forced outside the walls, and he planned to follow her. Once she was far enough away from the abbey and no one could see her, Percy would take her. He had enough men to ambush her guards and overwhelm them. No one would even know or care what happened to her, and if Percy wanted to, he could lock her in the bowels of his castle and keep her there for as long as he wished.</p><p>Coswold had the same intention. \u201cIsla, go and tell my servants to prepare to leave,\u201d he commanded in a whisper.</p><p>She nodded and hurried to do his bidding. But as she passed the scorned woman, she slowed her pace and turned her head so that only Gabrielle could witness her sly smile.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</p><p>W HAT MALICIOUS REASON DID THE WOMAN HAVE TO lie? What was her purpose? And what about the monk? Why did he substantiate her lies? What did he have to gain?</p><p>Brodick didn\u2019t have any answers. The only fact he knew to be true was that in less than ten minutes\u2019 time the two of them had destroyed Gabrielle\u2019s life. They had disgraced and dishonored her, snatched her future from her, and shamed and humiliated her father. Both Baron Geoffrey and his daughter would no doubt suffer King John\u2019s displeasure, for she was no longer of any value to him. Brodick knew there was a good chance that the baron\u2019s lands would be confiscated\u2014John was notorious for taking what belonged to others, including wives and daughters\u2014and with his twisted mind and his unpredictable temper, there was also a possibility that he would have Baron Geoffrey executed to make an example of him.</p><p>And Gabrielle? What would he do to her?</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the English in all their depravity,\u201d Colm said with disgust.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle is innocent.\u201d Father Gelroy had tears in his eyes, so great was his distress. \u201cShe\u2019s kind and gentle,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIf only you knew...\u201d</p><p>The priest stopped in the nick of time. He was about to blurt out that, if Colm and Brodick were aware of the lengths Gabrielle had gone to to protect Liam and save his life, they would know for a certainty that she would never do anything to disgrace her family\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cIf we only knew what?\u201d Colm asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you only knew her,\u201d he hastily said. \u201cShe is innocent of these terrible accusations.\u201d</p><p>Colm turned to the priest. \u201cWe already know she\u2019s innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, we do,\u201d Brodick agreed.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>Brodick sighed. \u201cWe do,\u201d he repeated. \u201cBut at the moment, that doesn\u2019t matter, does it? Look at them. They have all condemned her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they have.\u201d Gelroy was wringing his hands. He stared at Gabrielle as he whispered, \u201cTerrible things will happen to her if they take her back to England and hand her over to King John. That lecherous man is capable of vile deeds, and I will tell you this, when he is finished with her, he\u2019ll...\u201d He couldn\u2019t go on. Gabrielle\u2019s future was too horrible to speak of.</p><p>\u201cThe woman who accused her...\u201d Brodick began.</p><p>\u201cIsla,\u201d Gelroy said. \u201cI heard them say her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe lies,\u201d Colm said.</p><p>Gelroy agreed with a nod. \u201cShe will have to answer to God for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about the monk?\u201d Brodick asked. \u201cWhy did he confirm her lies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know this monk?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>\u201cI do. He\u2019s young and eager to serve, and I believe him to be an honest man. I can\u2019t imagine why he would say that he had seen Gabrielle. It has to be a mistake, and I\u2019ll seek him out and ask him to tell me exactly what he thinks he saw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe damage is already done,\u201d Brodick said.</p><p>Gelroy\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cYes it is. They have ruined Lady Gabrielle\u2019s life. Shame to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPriest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Laird MacHugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I leave the abbey, you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>Gelroy had the sudden urge to throw himself over the parapet. He took a step back, judged the distance to the steps, and then found a bit of courage. He wouldn\u2019t run. He would politely decline.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re inviting me to serve your clan...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you choose to think of it as an invitation, you may.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I decline?\u201d the priest gulped.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The lump in Gelroy\u2019s throat made it difficult for him to speak, and it took every ounce of self-control he possessed to stand before the MacHugh. Praying that the laird had indeed come to the abbey to seek a priest, and not, as Gelroy feared, to exact revenge for his brother, he rasped, \u201cI will be happy to go with you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Brodick laughed. \u201cNow who\u2019s telling lies? Your face gives you away.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassed, Gelroy admitted, \u201cI do have trepidation, but I will do my best to minister to the MacHugh clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo and gather what you wish to take with you,\u201d MacHugh ordered.</p><p>Brodick waited until the priest was out of sight before speaking. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it said that once a priest finds a home with any clan, it\u2019s impossible to get rid of him. I\u2019ve a feeling you\u2019re going to be stuck with Gelroy for the rest of your days.\u201d</p> <p>Had Gelroy heard Brodick\u2019s prediction, he wouldn\u2019t have agreed. The sooner he could complete his duty and be away from the MacHughs, the better.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wish to irritate the laird by dragging his feet, and so he ran all the way back to his quarters to pack his holy water and oils, his stole, and the rest of his possessions. Laird MacHugh had ordered one of his younger soldiers to accompany the priest, and Gelroy thought the laird did so to make certain he wouldn\u2019t try to run away.</p><p>God only knew Gelroy wanted to flee, but with Lady Gabrielle in such need, he had to put his own fears aside. All he could think about was finding a way to help her.</p><p>He thought she would be worried about her guards waiting for her. It wouldn\u2019t do for them to join in this monstrous persecution. Four guards and one woman standing against a hundred incensed men...no, no. The guards must stay outside the gates until this dreadful drama was over. Then, God willing, they could help Gabrielle find shelter away from these terrible people.</p><p>Gelroy headed for the front gates. The warrior blocked him. \u201cYou\u2019re to go back to Laird MacHugh,\u201d he said as he took the two bags filled with Gelroy\u2019s things. \u201cI\u2019ll see that these get tied to one of our saddles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPray be patient with me,\u201d Gelroy replied. \u201cI must give Gabrielle\u2019s guards orders to continue to wait. She would not want them to come inside the abbey, for there is danger here. It will take but a minute.\u201d</p><p>The warrior agreed with a quick nod.</p><p>Stephen stood with Gabrielle\u2019s horse just north of the gate. He came forward when he spotted Gelroy with the Highlander.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle will be joining you soon. Do you have her clothes and other necessaries with you?\u201d Father Gelroy asked.</p><p>Stephen shook his head. \u201cWe have some of her things. Her maids packed her trunks. We plan to catch up to them by late this afternoon. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>He hated to lie, but Gelroy excused the sin by telling God he was only protecting the guards and Gabrielle from a mob wanting blood.</p> <p>\u201cShe wanted me to make certain because her plans have changed. She will tell you in just a few minutes when she joins you. She bids you stay and wait for her here.\u201d</p><p>Stephen had no reason to doubt the priest, for he knew that Gelroy had become a friend to Gabrielle.</p><p>As Gelroy hurried back to the wall, the MacHugh clansman accompanying him remarked, \u201cYou lied to that man. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo protect him and the others. The lady would want it so,\u201d he added. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t wish for them to try to interfere in this debacle, as they would be sorely outnumbered.\u201d</p><p>His escort continued to follow Gelroy and wouldn\u2019t leave his side until the priest was halfway up the stairs. Gelroy knew that the man was also suspicious that he might decide to hide. When he reached the top step, he stopped and waited for one of the lairds to bid him to come forward. Brodick noticed him and motioned to him.</p><p>Gelroy cleared his throat to get MacHugh\u2019s attention and said, \u201cLaird, I cannot leave until I know that Lady Gabrielle will be safe from these monsters. With your permission, I\u2019ll go and stand by her side.\u201d</p><p>Before MacHugh could respond, Gelroy straightened his shoulders and turned to Brodick. \u201cLaird Buchanan, Gabrielle\u2019s father isn\u2019t here to defend her honor, and you are her only relative. You must help her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not tell me my duty, priest.\u201d Brodick\u2019s voice was harsh. \u201cI know it well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course you do,\u201d he said, nodding vigorously.</p><p>Dismissing Gelroy, Brodick watched the crowd below. They were being whipped into a frenzy by Coswold and Percy.</p><p>\u201cColm, I\u2019ll take her home with me. I can protect her there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeping her safe won\u2019t restore her honor,\u201d Colm said grimly.</p><p>Brodick agreed. \u201cShe deserves better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father...he isn\u2019t like those barons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t allow him on my land if he were,\u201d he replied. \u201cI know him to be a righteous man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend word to him that his daughter is staying with you, and he\u2019ll come and get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that simple. Baron Geoffrey will have to gather his vassals and prepare for war. If the king confiscates his property\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be powerless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. \u201cGabrielle needs a strong protector. She\u2019s my wife\u2019s cousin. It\u2019s expected that I would shield her, but that wouldn\u2019t prove she is innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care what others think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he countered, \u201cbut if Gabrielle were my wife, I would kill any man who would dare attack her honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs would I,\u201d Colm said.</p><p>\u201cBut she has no husband to defend her honor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think perhaps you should take her home with you.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, Colm said, \u201cAnd what would that accomplish? What difference would it make if I offered her my protection instead of you? You\u2019re as strong as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot marry her.\u201d</p><p>The statement lay between them for a long moment before Colm responded. He knew exactly what Brodick wanted. \u201cYou ask too much of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a debt to repay. I ask what you can give.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage? No. It\u2019s out of the question.\u201d</p><p>Brodick shrugged. \u201cIt makes sense to me. If you marry her, everyone will know you believe her to be innocent. You would not marry a whore. You\u2019re respected and feared by most of the other clans. You could restore her honor by giving her your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You will have to come up with another solution,\u201d Colm answered emphatically.</p><p>Brodick wasn\u2019t deterred. He knew Colm MacHugh would eventually do the honorable thing.</p><p>\u201cDo you suggest there might be another laird more powerful than you who hasn\u2019t taken a wife yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not suggesting anything, Buchanan. This is your problem to solve, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wife for a brother. You save her life as I helped save your brother.\u201d</p><p>Colm\u2019s jaw was clenched tight.</p><p>A Buchanan called out. \u201cLairds, Lady Gabrielle is leaving. They\u2019ve opened the gates.\u201d</p><p>Brodick looked at the commons just as a man stepped forward and spit on the ground in front of Gabrielle.</p><p>Colm saw another man pushing his way through the throng as Gabrielle was walking toward the gates. The man called out to her, but she ignored him and continued on. He grabbed her arm then, swung her around, and hit her face with his fist. Had he not had a firm grip on her, she would have dropped to the ground.</p><p>Colm was already heading for the stairs with Brodick right behind him as he called out to one of his men, \u201cFind out who he is.\u201d</p><p>All the warriors, both Buchanans and MacHughs, understood the command. Gelroy didn\u2019t. He hadn\u2019t seen what happened below.</p><p>\u201cWho is he talking about? What does he want?\u201d the priest asked one of the men who was pushing his way past.</p><p>The man didn\u2019t slow his descent. \u201cHe wants to know who struck Lady Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone struck her? Oh dear Lord,\u201d Gelroy replied. He pivoted on the step and rushed behind the others. \u201cBut why does he\u2014\u201d</p><p>The last warrior to leave answered. \u201cThe MacHugh wants to know the name of the man he\u2019s going to kill.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</p><p>S HE WAS TRAPPED IN A NIGHTMARE.</p><p>An hour ago she was Lady Gabrielle, daughter of Baron Geoffrey of Wellingshire and Princess Genevieve of St. Biel. She had been loved, happy, and hopeful for her future. Now Gabrielle was hated, treated like a leper, and she had no future.</p><p>It was too much to take in. Survival was what mattered right now. She had to find a safe place for her and her guards. And though she didn\u2019t have a destination in mind, she wanted to get as far away as possible from the heinous barons and their henchmen. Then perhaps she would be able to make sense out of what had just happened.</p><p>First, however, she needed time to calm down and quiet her racing heart. She could barely breathe. Strangers screamed foul names at her as she passed them on the long, seemingly endless walk to the front gates.</p><p>The humiliation and shame were unbearable. It took all of her concentration to show no emotion. She didn\u2019t hurry her pace\u2014though God knows she wanted to run\u2014and she didn\u2019t allow a single tear to fall, for to do either would have given the rabid crowd satisfaction. Pride was all she had left. She would not let them take that from her.</p><p>The side of her face throbbed from the hit she\u2019d taken. She\u2019d seen the fist coming and tried to step back from her attacker, a brute of a man with hatred smeared all over his ugly face, but he latched on to her and wouldn\u2019t let her retreat. Fortunately, she was able to twist away and lessen the impact. He was more than twice her size and weight. If she hadn\u2019t moved, his fist surely would have broken her jaw.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t damage her,\u201d Coswold had bellowed a scant second before the attacker\u2019s fist slammed into her face.</p><p>The blow had stunned her, and she had staggered back just as a stone struck her from behind. She quickly righted herself and kept walking. Another stone and then another hit her. Though dazed, she still heard the baron\u2019s shout. Damage her? What a ludicrous command. Coswold, Isla, and Percy had already destroyed her reputation and attacked her character. She had been stripped of everything. In the eyes of her countrymen, she no longer existed, and she belonged nowhere. What difference did it make if they disfigured her as well?</p><p>The abbot was waiting for her at the gate. He pulled it open, bowed his head, and whispered, \u201cGod be with you.\u201d</p><p>Did he believe the lies? There were tears in his eyes, but she couldn\u2019t tell if they were tears of sympathy or shame.</p><p>She stepped outside, heard the huge door shut behind her, and then the harsh sound of the bolt slipping into place.</p><p>Stephen let out a shout when he saw her. He leaped from his horse and ran to her while Faust, Lucien, and Christien all drew their swords in preparation for a fight.</p><p>She knew she must look awful. A stone had cut her skin just below her right eye, and she felt blood trickling down her cheek. Her jaw was sore and probably already beginning to swell and bruise.</p><p>\u201cPrincess, what happened to you?\u201d Stephen asked, appalled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d she answered, her voice surprisingly strong, \u201cbut we must leave. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re bleeding!\u201d Christien\u2019s face was red with anger as he swung toward the closed gates. \u201cWho did this to you? We will kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you will not go back into the abbey,\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Faust pulled his tunic over his head and doused it with water from his leather pouch. Leaning down from his saddle, he handed the wet cloth to Gabrielle. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she assured him, quickly wiping the blood from her cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything, but please, we must be away from here with all possible haste.\u201d</p><p>They heard the urgency in her voice and didn\u2019t question the command. Stephen lifted her onto Rogue\u2019s back, handed her the reins, then swung up on his mount. Assuming she wanted to catch up with her father\u2019s staff, he turned south.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she cried out. \u201cWe must go north.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t your father\u2014\u201d Lucien began.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. If the barons change their minds and decide to take me to the king\u2014their King John,\u201d she corrected, \u201cthey will look for us to the south. They\u2019ll never find us hidden in the forest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why\u2014\u201d Stephen began.</p><p>\u201cNo questions now,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we are away from here, I will explain.\u201d</p><p>Stephen nodded. \u201cWe go north.\u201d</p><p>Christien was the last in the procession and the first to feel the ground shake beneath him. The Highlanders approached from the hill below. He called to the others riding ahead of him.</p><p>When she turned and saw the approaching horde, Gabrielle panicked, thinking her enemies were in pursuit. But as they drew closer, she recognized the two men leading them: Buchanan and MacHugh. They looked wild and ferocious and proud...and dangerous. A magnificent sight: like a bolt of lightning, beautiful to observe from a distance but terrifying up close.</p><p>The sound of the pounding hooves was deafening.</p><p>\u201cLet them pass,\u201d she shouted to her guards. She guided Rogue to the left to give the charging Highlanders room, but they didn\u2019t go around. They fanned out. Gabrielle urged Rogue into a full gallop, yet they gained on her, surrounding her and her guards and swallowing them into their midst. Enclosed in this thick circle of warriors, they rolled over one hill and climbed the next.</p><p>Anyone looking out from the abbey would have seen only the clansmen heading back to their homes. Gabrielle and her guards were completely hidden from view.</p><p>Was that their intent? She was so relieved and thankful to be getting farther and farther away from the barons, she wasn\u2019t going to worry about the Highlanders\u2019 motives. Besides, she\u2019d already spotted Father Gelroy bouncing along on his mount. A grimace on his face, the poor priest appeared to be hanging on to the pommel of his saddle for dear life. If any of them meant to do harm, would they have brought a priest along to witness their dark deeds?</p><p>They veered to the northwest. When they reached the edge of Finney\u2019s Flat, a good two hours\u2019 ride from the abbey, she heard one of the men shout that they were on Buchanan land. Rogue was more than ready to rest, and Gabrielle wasn\u2019t going to push her horse any farther without a respite.</p><p>She was surprised the Highlanders didn\u2019t trample her when she abruptly pulled up. They stopped with her, but before she even had time to dismount, they were on the ground, surrounding her.</p><p>Her guards stood at attention, ready for what might come. Their hands were at their sides, but their stance wasn\u2019t relaxed. They knew that if they even looked as though they were going to reach for their swords, it would be their last earthly act. The Highland warriors would kill to protect their lairds, just as the guards would fight to the death for their princess. As long as the Highlanders didn\u2019t press in on them, they would stand their ground. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Knowing her guards wouldn\u2019t back down, no matter how many men they were up against, Gabrielle worried for their lives. She heard one of the Highlanders give the command to fall back. She hoped it was the wild Buchanan she\u2019d heard, but when the soldiers parted, she saw that it wasn\u2019t her cousin who had spoken. It was the other laird, the ruthless man who had greeted his long-lost brother with his fist.</p><p>He was as big and ferocious-looking as she remembered, but there was something else surprising about him. One might even say he was actually handsome, if one liked the rugged, flawed, somewhat scarred type. She didn\u2019t. But if there was anything she did like about his appearance, it was the color of his hair. It was blond, with a hint of red. It framed a face stern and rigid, reminding her of a Viking from the stories of times past. Most likely he was just as mean and barbaric.</p><p>Colm MacHugh stopped when he was barely a foot away from Stephen. The two men sized each other up, then Colm ordered, \u201cGet out of my way.\u201d</p><p>Stephen moved not an inch. Colm was at least a head taller and much more muscular, but the guard didn\u2019t give. He took orders from no one but Princess Gabrielle. The same went for his fellow guards. Faust and Christien moved to stand with Stephen, while Lucien stood with his back to hers.</p> <p>Brodick joined Colm as Gabrielle said, \u201cThey mean us no harm.\u201d</p><p>A part of her actually believed that to be true, that the Highlanders had followed them to help, not hurt. Still, after today\u2019s horror, anything was possible.</p><p>\u201cStep aside and let me speak to them,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>Her guards moved away, cautiously keeping an eye on the Highlanders.</p><p>\u201cWhat language are you speaking?\u201d Brodick asked the question in Gaelic.</p> <p>She responded in kind. \u201cIt is the language of my mother\u2019s homeland, St. Biel.\u201d</p><p>Her command of their language was excellent. Brodick assumed her father had taught her. His wife, Gillian, would do well to take a lesson from Gabrielle. His men still occasionally winced when she spoke to them.</p><p>Turning to Colm, he remarked, \u201cShe isn\u2019t all English, just half.\u201d</p><p>Why Brodick thought that fact would matter was beyond Colm. Half English was the same as all English to him. Colm\u2019s response was a noncommittal shrug.</p><p>Brodick stepped toward Gabrielle. When her guards reacted, he glared at them. His followers also took offense and moved forward.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Gabrielle called out. She raised her hand and repeated the command: \u201cEnough.\u201d</p> <p>Since she\u2019d spoken Gaelic, it was obvious to Brodick and Colm that she hadn\u2019t given the order to her guards but to their soldiers. Her assertiveness amused Brodick, but it irritated Colm.</p><p>Only after a signal from their lairds did the men move back, but all intently watched her protectors. Gabrielle thought perhaps they were waiting for an opportunity to pounce.</p><p>\u201cDo you know who we are?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re the wild\u2014that is to say, you\u2019re my cousin, Laird Buchanan. I\u2019ve heard stories about you.\u201d The comment didn\u2019t remove his scowl. \u201cThey were most impressive stories about your cunning and your strength.\u201d</p><p>He clasped his hands behind his back. \u201cWho told you these stories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father, Baron Geoffrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the stories are true. He would not lie.\u201d</p><p>She knew she was going to have to acknowledge the other laird, and a shiver of dread rushed through her when she finally turned and met MacHugh\u2019s piercing eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI also know who you are.\u201d</p><p>His response was a slightly raised eyebrow. She wasn\u2019t deterred. \u201cYou\u2019re Laird MacHugh, and you have a most peculiar way of greeting your brother.\u201d</p><p>Colm didn\u2019t understand her meaning. \u201cHow do I greet him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith your fist.\u201d</p><p>Ah. So she\u2019d been watching Liam leave the abbey.</p><p>For the briefest of seconds Gabrielle saw a hint of warmth in his eyes. It was long enough for her to realize he wasn\u2019t a complete ogre.</p><p>Father Gelroy pushed his way through the clansmen. He bowed to Gabrielle and then turned to address Colm. \u201cLaird MacHugh, these are the good men who protected your brother while he was recovering from his injuries at the abbey. I mentioned them to you before, but I wanted to make certain you hadn\u2019t forgotten.\u201d</p><p>The priest had a little courage deep inside him after all, Colm thought. Gelroy dared to remind him that he owed these men his gratitude. Colm hated owing anyone anything. The debt always weighed heavily until it was repaid.</p><p>He didn\u2019t thank the guards, but nodded in acknowledgment of what they had done. The other Buchanans and MacHughs, hearing what the priest had said, also relaxed their positions.</p><p>\u201cDid anyone try to get to my brother while you were guarding him?\u201d he asked the four.</p><p>Gabrielle started to answer no, but decided she should let them speak for themselves.</p><p>\u201cStephen, did anyone try to hurt Liam while you or the others were protecting him?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated before answering, then gave a quick nod. \u201cTwo men came that first night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Brodick asked Gabrielle.</p><p>Gabrielle was so surprised by the guard\u2019s answer she ignored Brodick. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t feel it necessary to tell you,\u201d Lucien said.</p><p>\u201cYou asked us to guard him, and that\u2019s what we did,\u201d Stephen said.</p><p>\u201cWe took care of the matter,\u201d Faust added.</p><p>Brodick and Colm had waited long enough to get an answer.</p><p>\u201cYou will tell us what they said,\u201d Colm ordered.</p><p>She quickly apologized and asked Stephen and the others to speak directly to the lairds.</p><p>Stephen turned to Colm and in Gaelic said, \u201cLaird MacHugh, two men came for your brother the first night we guarded him.\u201d</p><p>If the lairds were surprised that Gabrielle\u2019s guards were also proficient in their language, they didn\u2019t show it. Colm folded his arms and waited for further explanation.</p><p>\u201cThey were dressed as monks, but carried knives in their sleeves,\u201d Lucien said.</p><p>\u201cLucien and I were on watch,\u201d Christien explained.</p><p>\u201cWe waited until we were certain they meant to murder your brother before we acted,\u201d Lucien said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what did you do when you realized what they were about?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>\u201cWe killed them,\u201d Christien answered frankly.</p><p>Colm nodded approval. \u201cDid they speak? Did you hear their names?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDid they mention where they were from or who sent them?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucien answered. \u201cThey spoke your language, but differently from the way you speak it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDescribe these men,\u201d Brodick ordered.</p><p>Lucien told of two men with long hair and beards who were burly but not exceptionally tall.</p><p>After he had finished, Christien added, \u201cThey were ordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo marks on their skin or their weapons,\u201d Lucien explained.</p><p>\u201cMy brother slept through this fight?\u201d Colm asked.</p><p>Christien was offended by the question. \u201cThere was no fight. We didn\u2019t give them time to fight us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA surprise attack then,\u201d Brodick said, nodding approval.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Lucien said, \u201cthey saw us coming.\u201d</p><p>Colm admired their conceit. \u201cWhat did you do with the bodies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t leave Liam unprotected, so we kept the bodies in the corner of his room until Stephen and Faust arrived to relieve us,\u201d Christien said. \u201cThen, Lucien and I carried the bodies outside the abbey and threw them in the ravine. It was still dark; I\u2019m certain no one saw us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe tossed dirt over them, but by now the animals have probably gotten to them.\u201d</p><p>The questions continued, but Gabrielle wasn\u2019t paying attention. She was still reeling from the casual admission that her guards had killed two intruders. Honest to heaven, she didn\u2019t think she could take any more shocks. She was worn out; all she wanted to do was find a quiet spot and sit for a few minutes. Her world was crashing down around her, and she needed time to sort out the horrific events of the day before she tried to make plans.</p><p>Understanding these horrific events would take much, much longer.</p><p>When it appeared that the lairds\u2019 questions were at last finished, she called to Stephen. \u201cMay I have a word?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Gabrielle led Stephen away from the others so she wouldn\u2019t be overheard, but just to be absolutely certain, she spoke the language of St. Biel.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about these attackers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Princess, but I felt that if their bodies were found, you would be safer having no knowledge of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you recognize them? Could they have been at Finney\u2019s Flat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all got a good look at them, but none of us thought so. Remember, Princess, you are the only one who saw all of their faces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe description I just heard Lucien give the lairds didn\u2019t sound like any of the men I saw. Still, I thought perhaps they had followed us to the abbey.\u201d</p><p>Stephen shook his head. \u201cThat isn\u2019t possible. Christien kept backtracking to make certain we weren\u2019t being followed. He would have seen them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did those men know Liam was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone must have seen him, or seen us carrying him inside. It\u2019s difficult to keep secrets in such a large place with so many strangers coming and going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that is so, but he\u2019s safe now, isn\u2019t he? And that is all that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, Princess? From the cuts and bruises I see, I must assume you are not safe. Will you tell me what happened?\u201d</p><p>Dreading the task, she confessed to Stephen what had transpired in the commons. She couldn\u2019t look at him as she repeated the foul names she\u2019d been called, and her voice broke when she spoke of the monk who had confirmed Isla\u2019s story.</p><p>Stephen came to the same conclusion that she had, saying, \u201cHe must have seen you when you were on your way to look in on Liam.\u201d</p><p>Of the four guards, Stephen was the most pragmatic, and in a crisis, the most unruffled, but he could not contain his ire. \u201cIt is our duty to keep you safe, Princess, and you deliberately kept us in the dark. Had we known what was happening inside the abbey\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted. \u201cYou would have been killed because you and the others would have tried to defend me. I couldn\u2019t let that happen.\u201d</p><p>Frustrated, he answered sharply. \u201cIt is our responsibility to defend you.\u201d</p><p>Christien, Lucien, and Faust came running. Faust looked horrified when he said, \u201cStephen, you raised your voice to Princess Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you hear what she has just told me, you\u2019ll share my anger. Men dared to throw stones at her!\u201d he railed.</p><p>Gabrielle was saved from having to relive the nightmare once again when an unhappy Laird MacHugh approached.</p><p>\u201cI have yet to find out how my brother came to be at the abbey. In the time you were there, did you hear anything?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle answered, \u201cPlease keep in mind, Laird, very few people knew he was in the monks\u2019 quarters. Perhaps Liam will remember something. I suggest you ask him.\u201d</p><p>Colm turned his attention to her four guards. \u201cMy brother said he tried to talk to you. Why didn\u2019t any of you answer? Liam thought you didn\u2019t understand him, but since you clearly understand Gaelic, I want to know why you wouldn\u2019t speak to him.\u201d</p><p>Faust looked to Stephen. Receiving his permission with a quick nod, he said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</p><p>G ABRIELLE\u2019S GUARDS WERE ARROGANT, RUDE, INSULTING, blunt, and brutally honest. Colm couldn\u2019t help but like them. Had he not known better, he would have thought they were born and bred Highlanders. And since he didn\u2019t consider any of these traits flaws, there was no need to shove his fist down Faust\u2019s throat because of his insolent attitude.</p><p>There was much he wanted to know about their involvement with Liam, but he decided to put that matter aside for a moment and concentrate on Gabrielle. The sooner he explained what was going to happen to her, the better. He had a debt to repay, and by all that was holy, he would see it done.</p><p>While the others prepared to resume their journey, he waited for the guards to return to their horses before he addressed her. \u201cGabrielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Laird MacHugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will walk with me.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a request. It was an order, given in a harsh voice.</p><p>\u201cI will?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAye, you will.\u201d</p><p>The laird was used to getting his way. And why not? Gabrielle thought. He looked strong enough to lift a horse and not break a sweat. She could see the power in the way he moved, in his arrogant swagger, but she didn\u2019t feel threatened or frightened by it. His strength somehow made her feel secure. And what sense did that make?</p><p>But then, today had been one of the worst days of her life. Nothing made any sense to her.</p><p>\u201cYou will speak only Gaelic when you are with me,\u201d Colm ordered.</p><p>She tried not to take exception to his biting command. The laird was accustomed to his clan following his orders without question, but had he forgotten she wasn\u2019t a MacHugh? If he continued to be so abrasive, she would remind him of that fact.</p><p>Without a word, she walked across the small clearing to the shade of a bank of trees. She felt the soldiers\u2019 eyes on her.</p><p>She stopped and turned to face the laird.</p><p>Standing just a few feet from her, Colm gave her his full attention. He tried not to react physically, but that proved to be impossible. She was beautiful: long, softly curling hair the color of midnight, skin as pure as cream, eyes so violet and expressive they seemed to sparkle, and that mouth, dear God, that mouth could give any man fantasies. Even with the bruised jaw and the bloody cut on her cheek, she was irresistible.</p><p>Colm could not let his mind digress like this. The last thing he needed was a woman confusing his thoughts. In time, he was certain he would get used to her appearance, but he wasn\u2019t as certain about his followers. Even now his men were gawking. He turned to signal his disapproval, but none would spare him a glance; they were fully occupied watching her. If they were closer, he would slam some heads together\u2014that would get their attention.</p><p>Gabrielle waited patiently for Laird MacHugh to speak. The way he was staring so intently at her made her feel uneasy.</p><p>She attempted a smile and said, \u201cWhat is it you wish to say?\u201d</p><p>He saw no reason to ease into the topic. \u201cYou are going home with me.\u201d</p><p>She was certain she hadn\u2019t heard correctly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Would you mind repeating what you just said?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going home with me.\u201d</p><p>Totally bewildered, she asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Frowning, he said, \u201cBecause I have decided so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why would you want to take me home with you?\u201d she asked again.</p> <p>He let out a long, drawn-out sigh. He should have known it wouldn\u2019t be easy. Things having to do with the Buchanans always ended up being complicated, and this obviously wasn\u2019t going to be any different.</p><p>\u201cIt has been suggested by your cousin...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wild Buchanan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly did he suggest?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStop interrupting me.\u201d</p><p>She was immediately contrite. \u201cI apologize, Laird. Your announcement took me by surprise, and I\u2014\u201d She stopped. \u201cI make no excuses.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassment made her cheeks flush, and Colm knew that if he didn\u2019t stop noticing such things, he would never get through this. Clasping his hands behind his back, he scowled and tried once again.</p><p>\u201cBrodick suggested that you would be safe living with my clan under my protection.\u201d</p><p>She folded her arms and waited a few seconds before responding. \u201cWhy would Laird Buchanan make any suggestions regarding my welfare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour father wasn\u2019t at the abbey, and because Brodick is related, the duty to protect you fell on his shoulders.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrodick isn\u2019t my guardian. My father is.\u201d</p><p>Colm nodded. \u201cYes, that is so,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cBut he wasn\u2019t there, was he?\u201d Before she could answer, he added, \u201cWe were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know you were. When I walked into the commons, I looked up and I saw you, but I thought...that is to say, I assumed you were leaving just then.\u201d Suddenly completely rattled, she took a step back and shook her head. \u201cWhy did I think that? Why did I assume you were leaving? I never even looked up at the wall again once the shouting started.\u201d Frantic now, she whispered, \u201cWhen did you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you did.\u201d</p><p>She felt sick. \u201cThen you witnessed...\u201d She couldn\u2019t finish the question.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She took another step back. Had all the men with the lairds also heard and seen her humiliation? Yes, of course they had. That was why they were all staring at her now. Did they think she was a whore? A Jezebel? Why weren\u2019t they shouting obscenities at her like the others?</p><p>She stopped retreating and straightened her shoulders. She decided she wouldn\u2019t defend herself or protest her innocence. She wouldn\u2019t cower, either. If, like the mob hurling insults and stones, they wanted to think the worst of her, so be it. She summoned every last ounce of courage she possessed, but there was so little left. She was once again overwhelmed with shame for something she hadn\u2019t done.</p> <p>Colm saw the sadness enter her eyes and the color drain from her face. He had the crazy urge to try to make her feel better. \u201cYou are a confusing woman,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Gabrielle could not argue with his opinion, for her thoughts whirled in every direction. Why would this man offer her his home? What could he possibly gain from this? Nothing made sense.</p><p>She and her guards certainly needed a safe haven while she planned for their future. Living with the MacHughs would be a sound, but temporary solution, providing she understood the laird\u2019s reasons for offering. In her present state of mind, she didn\u2019t dare trust anyone to do the right thing. Was MacHugh honorable, or did he have twisted motives of his own?</p><p>\u201cI think you must be a good man and an honorable leader\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cHow could you possibly know what I am?\u201d</p><p>It was the opening she was looking for. \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd since I couldn\u2019t possibly know, you cannot take offense to my demand to understand your true motives. I ask you again, Laird, \u2018Why do you want me\u2014\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you. Wanting has nothing to do with this. I\u2019m paying a debt to Brodick Buchanan, and that is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She didn\u2019t know whether to be relieved or offended. Things had been happening so fast, she hadn\u2019t had time to think. \u201cYou don\u2019t want...that is to say, you\u2019re paying a debt?\u201d</p><p>Hadn\u2019t he just said as much? The woman was the most confounding creature Colm had ever met. Her emotions had gone from mortification to fear and despair, and now, damned if the woman didn\u2019t look disgruntled. He had assumed she wouldn\u2019t act favorably to being told she was to live with him, but he hadn\u2019t suspected such a bizarre reaction. This was proving even more difficult than he had anticipated.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Laird, for offering your home. Have no worries, you won\u2019t have to put up with the inconvenience for more than a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not offering temporary lodging, and you won\u2019t be leaving in a few days. You\u2019re coming home with me to stay.\u201d</p><p>One of his men called to him. Colm answered by putting his hand up for silence and responding to the man, \u201cYou will wait to speak until I\u2019ve finished with this.\u201d</p><p>Finished with this? Apparently, Gabrielle thought, she was the \u201cthis\u201d he was referring to.</p><p>\u201cI thank you for your offer of hospitality,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I cannot go with you.\u201d</p><p>Declining his invitation seemed the logical thing to do because she had just come up with another destination. She and her guards would go home with Laird Buchanan. The Buchanans could keep her just as safe as the MacHughs.</p><p>But why hadn\u2019t Buchanan offered?</p><p>Colm wasn\u2019t certain how to proceed. In truth, he was astonished that she would turn down his protection. Didn\u2019t the daft woman realize the danger she was in? Did she understand what being an outcast meant?</p><p>He decided to enlighten her, but before he could explain how precarious and bleak her situation was, she asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Laird Buchanan offer his home and his protection? I am related to him.\u201d</p><p>Colm glanced over his shoulder, found Brodick in the crowd of men straining to overhear the conversation, and tilted his head toward Gabrielle.</p><p>From the look on Colm\u2019s face, Brodick knew the discussion wasn\u2019t going well. He crossed the clearing, and with his gaze locked on Gabrielle, he asked, \u201cWhy is this taking so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s being difficult,\u201d Colm told him.</p><p>She immediately protested. \u201cI must disagree, Laird. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m being in the least bit difficult.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem?\u201d Brodick asked Colm. \u201cDid you tell her what\u2019s going to happen?\u201d</p><p>Ah, that\u2019s where he went wrong. He\u2019d told her Brodick\u2019s suggestion instead of commanding her obedience.</p><p>\u201cLaird MacHugh kindly offered\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI what?\u201d he roared.</p><p>\u201cYou kindly...\u201d she began again.</p><p>When his eyes narrowed and the creases in his brow deepened, she understood. Using the word \u201ckindly\u201d was obviously some sort of an insult. What a strange group of men these Highlanders were. She would be relieved to be rid of them.</p><p>She didn\u2019t dare smile. \u201cLaird MacHugh offered me his protection, and I declined. I politely declined,\u201d she stressed.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to know why you didn\u2019t offer her your home and your protection, Brodick,\u201d Colm said.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t fully explain the plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never got that far. This woman is prone to interrupting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabrielle,\u201d Brodick began, using what he believed was his most reasonable tone of voice. \u201cI could offer you my home and my protection\u2014and I\u2019ll admit my wife would be happy for your company. You would be safe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be pleased to accept your offer as long as you understand that it will be only for a few days. Is that agreeable?\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t given him time to tell her that MacHugh could do more than protect her; he could give her his name. Instead, she had accepted an invitation he hadn\u2019t extended.</p><p>\u201cThe woman\u2019s hell-bent on refusing help,\u201d Colm said.</p><p>Brodick nodded agreement.</p><p>Colm addressed Gabrielle. \u201cWhat happens in a few days? What is it you plan to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, I must find my father and warn him of the danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind him? You don\u2019t know where he is?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe was going to King John to give his account of what happened to Monroe, and he was going to catch up with me on my way back to England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think to roam the land until you happen upon him?\u201d Colm asked.</p><p>\u201cEven if you do find him, you wouldn\u2019t be able to follow him into England. You\u2019ve been exiled,\u201d Brodick reminded her. \u201cIf you\u2019re caught, you\u2019ll be executed, and if you\u2019re captured with your father, he\u2019ll also pay a high price.\u201d</p><p>They were forcing her to face reality, but she still couldn\u2019t abide the idea of anyone having to rescue her for something she hadn\u2019t done.</p><p>\u201cMy father must be told what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably hearing about it even now,\u201d Brodick suggested. \u201cOr he will hear soon. Bad news travels fast. He\u2019ll also hear that we were there,\u201d he added with a nod toward Colm, \u201cand I would wager he\u2019ll come to me looking for you.\u201d</p><p>This made sense to her. \u201cYes, that is what he would do, and that is yet another reason I should go home with you.\u201d</p><p>Brodick sighed in frustration. He didn\u2019t know how to make her understand.</p><p>\u201cYou know, in a dire, dire situation...where there is no other possible solution\u2014none at all\u2014and it is life-threatening,\u201d he stressed, \u201cyou can come to my home, for you are my wife\u2019s cousin. However\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colm interrupted him. \u201cWe\u2019ve wasted enough time here, Brodick. If you don\u2019t tell her, I will.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, she asked Colm, \u201cTell me what, Laird?\u201d</p><p>Brodick answered. \u201cIf you go near your father, you\u2019ll put him in harm\u2019s way. Is that what you want, Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, of course not, but I...\u201d</p><p>And then it struck her. The enormity of the situation finally penetrated. Dear God, what was she going to do? No one was safe with her. Even the Buchanans and the MacHughs were at risk.</p><p>MacHugh\u2019s first in command, Braeden, called out to him. Colm turned and saw another of his soldiers talking to Braeden, and both were staring at Gabrielle. Then Brodick\u2019s commander, Dylan, joined their discussion.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Colm shouted.</p><p>Braeden explained as he walked toward him. \u201cThe English.\u201d He glanced at Gabrielle before he continued. \u201cBoth barons are searching for her, and both have small armies with them.\u201d</p><p>Brodick asked, \u201cAre they heading this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Laird,\u201d he answered. \u201cOne of the barons leads his men to the south, and the other is heading toward the Monroes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually, when they can\u2019t find Gabrielle, they\u2019ll backtrack and come this way,\u201d Brodick said.</p><p>Colm agreed. He took Braeden aside to give him orders and finally turned back to her.</p><p>\u201cNow do you understand?\u201d He asked irritably.</p><p>Apparently she didn\u2019t. \u201cWhy would they be looking for me? You were there. You heard what they called me, and you surely heard that I was condemned in King John\u2019s name. Didn\u2019t they say that in their eyes I no longer exist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re now vulnerable,\u201d Brodick explained.</p><p>Colm was going to have to be more direct. \u201cAny man who is strong enough to fight off the others can have you now. Need I be more explicit?\u201d</p><p>Horrified, she frantically shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSince you no longer answer to any king nor belong to any country, you have no one to protect you from predators,\u201d Brodick explained, his voice much kinder than Colm\u2019s had been.</p><p>She bowed her head while fighting the terror inside. \u201cHow will I protect my father and my guards? They\u2019ll kill them.\u201d She whispered her fears.</p><p>\u201cYou worry about others instead of yourself?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. Instead, she took a deep breath and looked at the lairds. \u201cYou must leave immediately. Yes, that\u2019s what you must do.\u201d Her voice was strong now, determined. \u201cAll of you are in danger as long as you are with me. Go. Leave me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she just dismiss us?\u201d Colm looked incredulous.</p><p>\u201cAye, she did,\u201d Brodick said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she knows any better.\u201d</p><p>After a moment\u2019s thought, Colm decided Gabrielle hadn\u2019t realized she was insulting them by suggesting that they would run at the first hint of trouble. Both he and Brodick welcomed the opportunity to fight with the English, but neither would give in to the temptation as long as Gabrielle was in their care.</p><p>Exasperated, Colm said, \u201cGabrielle, you will not question my authority in the future.\u201d</p><p>She was slow to catch on. \u201cIn the future? What future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour future as my wife.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</p><p>T HERE WAS NO DISCUSSION. MACHUGH SIMPLY TOLD HER what was going to happen and then walked away.</p><p>All things considered, Gabrielle thought she handled herself quite well. She didn\u2019t scream or faint when the laird calmly announced that she would be spending the rest of her life with him. She might have paled, but she did not faint.</p><p>She took solace in one certainty: no way in Hell would she marry Laird MacHugh. She didn\u2019t like the man, and she knew he didn\u2019t like her. The debt he had to pay to Brodick must be staggering, for why else would he ruin his life by marrying a woman he barely knew and had heard such terrible lies about? As far as she knew, MacHugh thought she was a whore.</p><p>No, marriage was out of the question.</p><p>How terrible would it be if, just for a little while, Gabrielle let MacHugh think she was agreeable? This small deception would give her time to work on a plan for her future. After two or three days, she would tell him the truth...as she was leaving, of course.</p><p>She weighed the good against the bad. On the one hand, she and her guards would be safe from the barons. They would have shelter and protection. If the barons found out where she was staying, they wouldn\u2019t dare ride onto MacHugh land, for they would surely know they wouldn\u2019t come out alive.</p><p>On the other hand, she would be living with...him.</p><p>Laird Buchanan seemed most pleased with his friend\u2019s decision. Smiling and in good cheer, he motioned to his men that it was now time to leave. Gabrielle tapped on his shoulder. She was about to ruin his good mood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCousin Brodick?\u201d</p><p>His smile vanished. \u201cIt isn\u2019t necessary for you to call me cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a moment to answer a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked warily.</p> <p>\u201cI understand why you would feel responsible for me, since I\u2019m your cousin.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle wondered why he grimaced at her reference to their relationship. Did he need to be reminded that he had married a woman from England? Did he grimace every time his wife spoke to him?</p><p>She decided to get right to the heart of her question. \u201cWhat debt is he paying that he must be responsible for me? He doesn\u2019t even know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut the question to him,\u201d he suggested. \u201cIf he wants to explain, he will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Laird,\u201d she continued, \u201cif you should hear from my father, will you please tell him not to come after me?\u201d</p> <p>Brodick started to turn away, then changed his mind. \u201cGabrielle, MacHugh won\u2019t let anything happen to you. He protects what belongs to him.\u201d</p><p>That said, he went on his way, leaving Gabrielle aghast. Belongs to him? She was now a possession?</p><p>Despite the sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach, she told herself to stay strong. She would keep an open mind about MacHugh. If she didn\u2019t draw attention to herself, maybe he would pay no attention to her or her guards, and if she stayed out of his way, perhaps he would stay away.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, it\u2019s time to leave.\u201d MacHugh spoke from directly behind her. She nearly fell into his arms when she whirled around.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear you approach,\u201d she stammered. \u201cYou move like a lion.\u201d</p><p>Amused, he asked, \u201cHave you ever seen a lion?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs a matter of fact, I have. In St. Biel, my father once showed me two lions. They were quite beautiful.\u201d</p><p>And fierce, she silently qualified. Much like you.</p><p>Gabrielle followed him to the horses. \u201cLaird, I want you to know that I will not defend myself. I don\u2019t care if you believe what the barons said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do care,\u201d he replied as he kept walking. \u201cWe know the woman lied.\u201d</p><p>Her hand flew to her heart, and she stopped. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I knew she was lying from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Apparently he was finished talking about it. Before she realized what he was going to do, he picked her up and all but tossed her onto Rogue\u2019s back. Braeden handed her the reins.</p><p>\u201cYour guards will be allowed to accompany you,\u201d Colm said.</p> <p>Did he honestly believe she would go with him if her guards were not allowed to go with her? He had already swung onto his horse and ridden away before she could ask.</p><p>The others fell into formation behind him. Riding hard through the valleys, their pace slowed once they reached the hills. The riders formed a single line to climb the narrow, treacherous trail ahead of them. After making one harrowing turn, she discovered they were on a bluff overlooking Finney\u2019s Flat. This was the spot the scoundrels who were holding Liam had watched as they waited for MacHugh to show himself. She squinted against the sun to see if she would be able to recognize anyone from such a distance. Impossible, she thought. Only an eagle could have seen Liam\u2019s face.</p><p>Realizing she was holding up the procession, she continued on. Rogue faltered near the first crevice, and stones rumbled down the steep cliff on the right. Gabrielle looked over the side and cringed. It was a sheer drop to the bottom of an abyss. Her horse continued to have trouble finding his footing. She let him go at his own pace, but still he stumbled twice more before the path finally widened and leveled. By then, her heart was racing.</p><p>When they reached a grassy slope she leaned down and whispered praise to Rogue as she patted him. When she straightened, she saw MacHugh watching her with a puzzled expression.</p><p>And on they continued. The weather turned damp and cold, and Gabrielle felt it in her bones. Without her heavy cloak, she was shivering in no time at all. She didn\u2019t think anyone noticed how miserable she was until MacHugh ordered Lucien to move out of his way so he could ride next to Gabrielle. Her guard had no choice in the matter. MacHugh\u2019s stallion would have trampled him if he hadn\u2019t moved back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold,\u201d he stated.</p><p>Was it an accusation? She couldn\u2019t tell. \u201cYes, I\u2019m cold.\u201d She added, \u201cGlaring at me won\u2019t make the shivers go away, Laird. Perhaps\u2014\u201d</p><p>She might have yelped. She couldn\u2019t be certain. It all happened so fast. One second he was listening to her, and the next he was lifting her from Rogue, settling her on his lap, and wrapping her in his plaid.</p><p>His chest was like a rock, a warm rock. So were his thighs. The heat radiating from him warmed her. Exhausted, she let herself relax against him. His scent was pleasant, like heather and the woods. The barons who had come for the wedding at the abbey drenched themselves in perfumes and oils, thinking the heavy fragrances would cover the foul stench of not bathing. Gabrielle found it nauseating to be in the same room with them. MacHugh was nothing like the barons.</p><p>She was suddenly plagued with guilt. It was wrong to deceive him, no matter what her reasons were.</p><p>\u201cI have deceived you,\u201d she blurted. \u201cI will only be staying with you for two or three days, Laird, and I have no intention of ever marrying you. I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you threw me off your horse this very minute. I hope you won\u2019t, but I wouldn\u2019t blame you.\u201d</p><p>His response wasn\u2019t what she expected. He pulled the plaid over her face and ignored her.</p><p>Lucien rode up next to the laird\u2019s horse and with a threatening look at Colm said, \u201cPrincess Gabrielle, do you need my help?\u201d</p><p>She pushed the plaid away from her face. \u201cI\u2019m warm now, Lucien. There is no cause to be concerned.\u201d She gave Colm a glance that was cross and reproachful, but when she turned back toward Lucien, there was a faint smile on her lips.</p><p>MacHugh tightened his hold. The woman had gone through Hell today, and still she could smile. If she was afraid of what tomorrow would bring, she wasn\u2019t letting it show.</p><p>Colm had lost his train of thought for a second or two, but he quickly regained his stern composure and said, \u201cI don\u2019t need your guard\u2019s permission to touch you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d she agreed. \u201cYou need mine.\u201d</p><p>Her comment obviously wasn\u2019t worthy of a response, she decided, unless a grunt meant something.</p><p>They rounded another hill, and suddenly his fortress loomed ahead of them. The watchtower was so tall it seemed to disappear in a cloud. A stone wall surrounded his holding, and a wooden drawbridge crossed a wide moat filled with water, black from the river stones deep in its bed.</p><p>Colm motioned for her guards to follow his soldiers inside. It was his ritual to be the last to cross the bridge. As soon as he had cleared the wooden planks, he signaled by raising his fist, and the drawbridge was lifted. The clanking sound of metal scraping against metal gave Gabrielle the feeling of being sealed inside a dungeon. She closed her eyes and forced the dark image from her mind. This was her sanctuary, not a prison.</p><p>The sun was setting as they crossed the lower bailey and started up the incline to the castle. The cottages they passed were dappled gold by the sun, and the grass on the slope ahead of them took on a fiery hue.</p><p>Clansmen stopped their chores and came outside to call to their laird and to stare at her. Children ran after them. Some of the women smiled. That would soon change, she thought, when they found out what she\u2019d been condemned for. Hopefully, she would be gone before then.</p><p>His home was not impressive by St. Biel\u2019s standards, or her father\u2019s, for that matter. The square structure wasn\u2019t large, but an addition was being constructed. Three sides were built of stone, and the remaining side, made of wood, was in the process of being reinforced with massive rocks. Scaffolding had been erected next to the keep with a winch and a treadmill to haul the stones up to the top floor.</p><p>\u201cYour fortress is different from the ones in England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is it different?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe castles in England usually have two walls. The outer wall surrounds the bailey, but then there\u2019s another defensive wall between the lower and the upper bailey. Sometimes there is even a drawbridge to further separate the lord\u2019s home from all the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no need for two walls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have only one watchtower,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI have need for only one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019m criticizing your home. I was just pointing out the differences. I\u2019m certain I shall be most content here.\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t agree, she assumed he had his mind on more important matters. Father Gelroy waved to her as he passed, and if her arms hadn\u2019t been trapped inside MacHugh\u2019s plaid, she would have waved back.</p><p>The stables were halfway between the lower and the upper bailey, and they passed the garrison on the way to the laird\u2019s courtyard. There wasn\u2019t anyone waiting at his door to greet him. Did he have other family besides Liam? She hadn\u2019t thought to ask that question. She\u2019d find out soon enough, she supposed.</p><p>MacHugh dismounted with her in his arms. The second he let go of her, she stepped back to put some distance between them.</p><p>\u201cWhere will my guards and I have rooms? Inside your home with you? Or do you want us to take two of the empty cottages? Are there any empty?\u201d Dear God, she was nervous. She couldn\u2019t stop talking. \u201cThat is to say, I\u2019d like to rest. I just need to know where I am to stay.\u201d</p><p>Father Gelroy saved her from continuing to ramble. \u201cPrincess Gabrielle, are you as tired and hungry as I am?\u201d</p><p>She latched on to his arm as though it was her lifeline. \u201cYes, I am,\u201d she said much more enthusiastically than necessary. \u201cI was just asking the laird where we should take our shelter for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll sleep inside,\u201d Colm said as soon as he could get a word in.</p><p>Braeden rushed ahead to the tall door made of oak timbers and thrust it open. Gabrielle thanked him as she walked past, but she came to a quick stop on the threshold. It was so dark inside, she couldn\u2019t see her way. Colm took her hand and pulled her along.</p><p>The wooden floor sagged under his weight, and the men\u2019s boots made a clatter in the cavernous space. Light filtered in through the open door. As Gabrielle\u2019s eyes adjusted to the darkness, she made out a room with a low ceiling. There was a large storeroom on her right. Shelves were filled with sacks of grain and barley, and there were barrels of wine stacked high. From the number of bags, it looked as though the MacHugh clan could hold off a siege for a good six months, perhaps more, though Gabrielle doubted their enemies would get all the way to the castle with the treacherous trail they would have to climb.</p><p>An opening in the wall on her left led to stairs, the steps surprisingly wide and deep. On the second level was the great hall. It was spacious, and a fireplace with a huge hearth took up much of the far wall. A welcoming fire warmed the room.</p><p>The housekeeper\u2014a stout, older woman named Maurna\u2014made them welcome and bid them to rest by the fire. After giving instructions, Colm left the hall. Stephen and Lucien went with him to see to the horses.</p><p>Another set of steps continued up to a third level, which, Maurna explained, held the armory. Laird MacHugh had ordered that her guards should sleep there and so could Father Gelroy until further arrangements could be made. Gabrielle was to be given the room next to it.</p><p>Gabrielle wouldn\u2019t have cared if she was given a stall in the stables. The day had caught up with her. Tired and hungry and dusty from the journey, a room next to the armory sounded like a blissful refuge. When Maurna announced that she had prepared a meal and would show them where they could wash their hands and faces, Gabrielle thanked her profusely.</p><p>At supper, Father Gelroy sat next to her and seemed agitated.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a chapel here,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t see one on the ride up to the courtyard, so I asked the housekeeper, and she told me there isn\u2019t one. I worry they may all be heathens. If that is the situation, I have my work cut out for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be a challenge, but I believe you\u2019ll do well here,\u201d she assured him.</p><p>He leaned closer and whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t think the laird brought me here to look after his followers\u2019 souls. I think he\u2019s wanting me to explain how Liam came to be in the abbey. He knows I didn\u2019t tell him everything about his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely he won\u2019t coerce you.\u201d</p><p>Maurna interrupted their discussion. \u201cIs there something wrong with the food, milady? You\u2019ve barely taken a bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe food is excellent,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just not as hungry as I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep is what you\u2019re needing, if I may be so bold to suggest. Would you like me to show you to your chamber?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle nodded. Saying good night to Father Gelroy and to Christien and Faust, she followed Maurna upstairs. Lucien caught up with her. He carried her satchel, which held two changes of clothes and the other essentials she had needed for her trip back to England.</p><p>\u201cIs the laird\u2019s brother here?\u201d he asked Maurna.</p><p>\u201cHe is indeed. And sleeping soundly since his return. Our healer is watching over him.\u201d</p><p>The first door they passed was the laird\u2019s chamber, Maurna pointed out.</p><p>The room Gabrielle was assigned had been used for storage. It was damp and musty. Maurna rushed ahead to light several more candles and placed them on the table across from the bed.</p><p>\u201cI tried to air the room for you, but it seems all I\u2019ve done is make it colder in here. Would you like me to pull the tapestry down over the window?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the bed ready for you and put extra blankets on top. There\u2019s water to wash with on the chest behind the door, and if you\u2019ll give me a few mintues, I\u2019ll see to lighting a fire in the hearth. My man, Danal, already carried up dry wood and put it in the box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll light the fire later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut milady, should you be doing common work?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cOf course I should.\u201d</p><p>Maurna was frowning intently. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not my place to mention it, but I couldn\u2019t help but notice you\u2019ve got blood on the back of your gown up high by your shoulder. Did you cut yourself?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle wondered what the woman would say if she told her the truth, that the stones the mob had thrown at her had caused the bleeding.</p><p>\u201cI must have,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Maurna wiped her hands on the cloth she had tucked into her belt and walked toward Gabrielle. \u201cSince you don\u2019t have a maid to assist you, I\u2019ll be doing it. Let me help you get that gown off so I can see the damage.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was no talking her out of it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a bother,\u201d Gabrielle protested. \u201cI can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how are you going to do that?\u201d Maurna asked as she tugged the bliaut over Gabrielle\u2019s head. \u201cHow are you going to reach behind you and clean your cut?\u201d</p><p>She stopped arguing. \u201cThank you, Maurna.\u201d</p><p>When the housekeeper saw Gabrielle\u2019s back, she clucked like a mother hen. \u201cYou poor dear. Your back is one big bruise.\u201d She rushed to the basin and dabbed a clean cloth into the water. She hurried back to Gabrielle. \u201cHow did this happen? Did you take a spill?\u201d Deciding that was exactly what must have happened, she went on, \u201cOf course you did. You sit down and wait while I go get some healing salve to put on those cuts. Wrap yourself in a blanket so you won\u2019t catch cold. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p> <p>Letting someone else take care of her was nice, Gabrielle admitted. It reminded her of home.</p><p>Homesickness and worry for her father suddenly overwhelmed her. She said a quick prayer to God to watch over him, and then, exhausted, she sat on the bed, closed her eyes, and waited for the housekeeper to return. It was quiet at last, and since there weren\u2019t any distractions, Gabrielle could replay in her mind the events of the day. Maybe she could sort them out and make sense of them.</p><p>Impossible. It was simply impossible to understand\u2014as though she was missing an important piece of a very bizarre puzzle. The barons had been so quick to condemn her. It couldn\u2019t all be about Finney\u2019s Flat, could it? Yet what more was there that the greedy pigs would want?</p><p>Maurna returned with the salve, and after she\u2019d tended to Gabrielle\u2019s back, she insisted on washing her face as though she were a child. Dabbing a bit of the salve on the cut under her eye, Maurna said, \u201cYou hit your face when you fell, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle nodded.</p> <p>\u201cDoes it pain you?\u201d Her voice was filled with sympathy.</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Gabrielle insisted. It did hurt, but she didn\u2019t want the housekeeper to worry over her. Or hover.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything more I can do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you, Maurna. You\u2019ve been most kind.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s blush was as bright red as her hair. \u201cI\u2019m only doing what I was told to do, milady. Our laird wants you to be comfortable here. Might I ask a question that\u2019s been nagging me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat am I to call you? I heard the soldiers who came with you and the priest address you as \u2018princess.\u2019 Are you a princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to be, but no longer.\u201d</p><p>The answer didn\u2019t make a lick of sense to the housekeeper, and she fretted that perhaps milady had struck her head in the fall.</p><p>\u201cAre you seeing two of me, milady?\u201d</p><p>Though Gabrielle thought the question was odd, she didn\u2019t laugh, for the housekeeper\u2019s expression showed her concern. \u201cNo,\u201d she assured her. \u201cJust one of you.\u201d</p><p>Maurna looked relieved. \u201cYou\u2019re plain worn out, aren\u2019t you? You rest well, milady.\u201d</p><p>The second the door closed, Gabrielle went to the window to pull the tapestry down. She usually loved cold weather, but tonight she wanted to bury herself under the covers and sleep. It was pitch black outside with nary a star in sight. She could see tiny golden lights glowing from the cottages dotting the hillside. Families preparing for bed, no doubt, tired from the day\u2019s labors, but content. She tried to picture the ideal family. There would be children, a healthy mother and father, and laughter. Aye, they would be happy and safe.</p><p>Again, her thoughts raced back to her father. Was he safe? Had he heard what the barons had done?</p> <p>Only when the chill became unbearable did she pull the drape and climb into bed. Too tired to light the fire, she snuggled under the MacHugh plaid and fell asleep saying her nightly prayers.</p><p>She awakened once during the night. The room was warm. A fire blazed in the hearth. How had that happened? She rolled over and drifted back into a deep slumber.</p><p>The following morning, Stephen was waiting for Gabrielle in the great hall. She greeted him and then asked him if he or one of the other guards had come into her room during the night.</p><p>\u201cLaird MacHugh asked the housekeeper to look in on you before she went to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently Maurna went into great detail about the bruises and cuts on your back. Perhaps the laird was worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Maurna started the fire?\u201d</p><p>Stephen shook his head. \u201cShe reported to the laird that your room was near to freezing, so he went in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came into my room?\u201d She couldn\u2019t hide her shock.</p><p>\u201cYes, he did,\u201d he replied. \u201cHe started the fire in the hearth. Faust couldn\u2019t stop him, and so he went with him and stood with his back to your bed, blocking the laird\u2019s view, though he reported that you were so hidden under the covers, no one could see anything.\u201d</p><p>Stephen sounded unconcerned about the matter. \u201cHow did Faust try to stop him?\u201d she asked as she crossed the great hall to sit at the table.</p><p>\u201cHe told me he got in the laird\u2019s way.\u201d</p><p>Hesitantly she asked, \u201cAnd what did the laird do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Faust, the laird got him out of his way. He didn\u2019t explain how.\u201d Stephens lips curled slightly in an uncharacteristic grin.</p><p>\u201cWarming the room was a thoughtful act,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cBut improper,\u201d he said disapprovingly. \u201cIf you will excuse me, I\u2019ll see to the other guards. The laird wishes to speak to you after you\u2019ve had your breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Princess. He asked that you wait here.\u201d</p><p>And wait she did, for over an hour, before the laird joined her. Gabrielle was standing with Maurna and the cook, a sweet-tempered woman named Willa, as the two women discussed the advantages of boiling a pheasant over roasting it on a fire\u2014a subject Gabrielle knew absolutely nothing about\u2014when she heard a door slam. A few seconds later, she heard men talking and then footsteps on the stone.</p><p>\u201cThat should be our laird,\u201d Maurna said. \u201cWilla and I will be about our chores so that you two can have your privacy.\u201d</p><p>Braeden and another soldier accompanied their laird. They bowed as they crossed the hall and continued on to the buttery.</p><p>MacHugh stood on the top step observing her. She was a fair sight. Her hair gently curled around her angelic face and fell in silky waves across her shoulders. His eyes moved down. It was impossible not to notice the soft curves of her body.</p><p>He wanted her, and the acknowledgment didn\u2019t please him. Gabrielle was a complication and a nuisance he didn\u2019t need in his life.</p><p>Gabrielle took a step toward him when he entered the great hall. Even though he was frowning\u2014his usual expression, she decided\u2014she smiled and bid him good morning.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t much for pleasantries. \u201cSit down, Gabrielle, while I talk to you about your future.\u201d</p><p>Why would he want to talk to her about her future? She had explained to him that she would be a guest for only two more nights. Had he forgotten?</p><p>She pulled a chair out from the table, sat down, and demurely folded her hands in her lap. He\u2019d sounded so serious, she began to worry that he\u2019d changed his mind and wasn\u2019t going to let her and her guards stay another night.</p><p>Colm wasn\u2019t fooled by the serene expression she\u2019d plastered on her face. He could tell she was nervous. Her folded hands were turning white, she was gripping them so tightly. And she sat rigidly straight and wouldn\u2019t look him in the eye.</p><p>He stood at the hearth with his arms folded in front of him while he considered her.</p><p>\u201cDo you wish to say something to me, Laird?\u201d she asked after a long silence.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. Gabrielle, no matter how I try to stop it, the clan will hear about your situation.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t think it was possible, but her back straightened even more. He expected her to snap at any second.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean to say that they\u2019ll hear I\u2019m a harlot?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou will not say that word again.\u201d He waited for her agreement before continuing. \u201cThere is a way to stop the rumors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you care what people say about me? I\u2019ll only be here for a short time. Unless you would prefer that I leave today. Is that it? Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you will go to the Buchanans,\u201d he said in exasperation.</p><p>\u201cYes, but only for one night or two. I\u2019m rested now, and I have already decided upon a plan for my future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that right? And what might that plan be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to St. Biel.\u201d</p><p>His sigh was long and drawn out. \u201cThe English control St. Biel, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but in the mountains I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t let her finish. \u201cAnd how are you planning to get there? Will you swim across the ocean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not. I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you even know how to swim?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t swim across.\u201d In frustration, she raised her voice. \u201cI\u2019ll go by ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat ship\u2019s commander would allow you passage?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf caught, the penalty would be his death...and yours and your guards,\u201d he thought to add. \u201cAnd if you were able to convince someone to take you, how could you trust him? Have you considered the possibility that he might have your guards killed, and then he and his men would spend the voyage taking turns with you?\u201d</p><p>Noticing how the blood had drained from her face, he said, \u201cHave I shocked you? Men are capable of such behavior. Have you forgotten the look in those barons\u2019 eyes when they watched you? What do you think they would have done if they\u2019d gotten hold of you?\u201d</p><p>He continued to fire questions at her, determined to make her realize it was a fool\u2019s dream to think she could live in peace in St. Biel.</p><p>\u201cThere are good people who would help me,\u201d she protested.</p><p>\u201cYou would put those good people in jeopardy? You would let them risk their lives for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>Colm destroyed every argument she gave, and within minutes any hope of leaving was gone.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to marry me, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders dropped and she sank back in her chair. \u201cIs there something in the air up here that is making every man I meet talk of marriage? In the past two days, I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m to marry two obscene barons, one Monroe upstart, and a despicable laird named MacHenley.\u201d</p><p>He flashed a smile. \u201cThe despicable laird you speak of is named MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged indifference. \u201cSince I\u2019m not ever going to speak to the vile man again, I don\u2019t care what his name is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is decided,\u201d he announced. \u201cYou will marry me, and no one will dare call you anything but Lady Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t asking me.\u201d</p><p>He looked affronted. \u201cOf course not. I\u2019m telling you.\u201d</p><p>His audacity was outrageous. Gabrielle felt the blood rushing back to her face, and it was difficult not to shout at him, though the urge was nearly overwhelming.</p><p>Colm could tell she was furious with him. Her hands were in fists in her lap now, and he knew it was only a matter of time before she lost her temper. He wondered if she realized how easy she was to read. Probably not, he decided, or else she wouldn\u2019t go to such lengths to try to hide her feelings.</p><p>Braeden interrupted. \u201cLaird, they\u2019re waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>Colm nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Giving Gabrielle his undivided attention once again, he asked impatiently, \u201cAre there any other questions?\u201d</p><p>Was he serious? Of course she had questions. Hundreds of them.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a dowry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need or want a dowry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes you different from the others. All they wanted was Finney\u2019s Flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t compare me to those bastards.\u201d Anger flashed across his face.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t intimidated. \u201cTo pay a debt to Laird Buchanan, you\u2019re willing to give up your future. I don\u2019t understand why you would do this.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what misconception to address first. \u201cDo you think Finney\u2019s Flat is the only reason those men wanted you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat more could there be?\u201d</p><p>Her question, though na\u00efve, was an innocent one. She really didn\u2019t know her own appeal, and therefore had obviously never used her beauty to get her way.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t waste time discussing their twisted motives,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you? You would ruin your life\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, I would never allow any woman to have that kind of power over me,\u201d he said unequivocally.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how the barons in England treat their wives, but I have a suspicion that most misuse them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot most,\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cWe do not mistreat our women here. I will never hurt you, and you will be well-protected.\u201d</p><p>She believed him. And suddenly marriage didn\u2019t sound so terrible after all. Perhaps because she had nowhere else to go.</p><p>\u201cDid you have a date in mind for this marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a choice,\u201d he said as he once again glanced toward the entrance. He was becoming more impatient to get this discussion over and done.</p><p>\u201cExplain this choice, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll marry now or in six months. However, if we marry now, we won\u2019t live as man and wife until six months have passed.\u201d</p><p>Thoroughly confused, she asked, \u201cWhy six months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that the clan will know the only child you carry is mine.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d rendered her speechless. When she found her voice again, she said, \u201cYou told me you didn\u2019t believe the lies\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted. \u201cThe suggestion came from Brodick. He doesn\u2019t want anyone to question who the father is if you were to be with child right after we\u2019re wed.\u201d</p><p>Appalled and embarrassed by his bluntness, she could only shake her head when he asked if there were any other questions he needed to answer before he took his leave.</p><p>Halfway to the stairs he remembered the other matter he wanted to talk to her about.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, I allowed your guards to accompany you here so that you would know that you are safe. But they cannot stay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She bounded to her feet. \u201cThey must stay.\u201d</p><p>He was astounded by her outburst. She\u2019d been so cooperative when he explained her future, but now she was belligerent and combative.</p><p>\u201cNo, they cannot stay,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cIt\u2019s my duty and the duty of my soldiers to protect you now that you are to live here, and it would be an insult for an outsider to interfere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. You must\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t open for discussion,\u201d he snapped. \u201cYour guards will be handsomely rewarded because they protected my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReward them by letting them stay here with me.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cShouting at me won\u2019t change my mind. I have another duty that is far more pressing, but when I return, I will talk to your guards. I\u2019m not in the habit of justifying my decisions, but in this instance, I will. Once I\u2019ve made my position clear, my men will escort them down the mountain. You\u2019ll have until then to say your good-bye.\u201d</p><p>He walked down two steps, turned around, and commanded, \u201cI will have your acquiescence.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him for several seconds, then affected a perfect curtsy.</p> <p>\u201cAs you say.\u201d</p><p>Relieved that there hadn\u2019t been any tears, Colm was in good spirits when he left the holding. Three hours later, upon his return, he was informed that Lady Gabrielle was gone.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY</p><p>M ACHUGH CAUGHT UP WITH HER NEAR THE BASE OF HIS mountain. She was still on his land, though just barely. Had he returned to his holding an hour later to hear of her departure, Gabrielle would have already started across Finney\u2019s Flat and been a fair target for the predators who waited for the cover of nightfall to crawl out from their holes.</p><p>What in God\u2019s name was the daft woman thinking to go out into the wilderness with but four men for protection? Didn\u2019t she realize what a temptation she was?</p><p>But she was safe, he told himself as he rode toward her. Safe from everyone but him, he qualified, for in his present mood, he was thinking hard about throwing her over his shoulder and carrying her back to his keep. Dragging her back didn\u2019t sound all that unappealing, either.</p> <p>Gabrielle heard his horse thundering toward her. She had stopped to water the horse and had walked far enough away from Rogue to know she couldn\u2019t get back to her horse before Colm caught up with her.</p><p>There was no guessing what his mood might be. The man was angry all right. The fire in his eyes and the clenched jaw were obvious indicators. He leaped from his horse before the animal had fully stopped, and though she had a strong desire to back away, she stood her ground and held her chin up as he stomped toward her.</p><p>Her guards naturally took a defensive position to block the laird, but Gabrielle knew MacHugh wouldn\u2019t retreat. She\u2019d been in his company long enough to learn that much about him. But then her guards wouldn\u2019t retreat, either. It was up to her to stop the confrontation before it started.</p><p>\u201cPlease move out of my way. I wish to speak to the laird.\u201d</p><p>Faust was worried. \u201cPrincess,\u201d he whispered, \u201cit is our duty to make certain he won\u2019t harm you.\u201d</p><p>Stephen, like Gabrielle, was a good judge of character, and he\u2019d already determined what the laird was all about. He had noticed the way MacHugh\u2019s clan had greeted him when the laird returned home. They were genuinely happy to see him, not afraid. Their homes were sturdy, there was firewood outside each door, and children didn\u2019t run away and hide when MacHugh and his soldiers came up the hill. MacHugh protected those he cared about, and the relief Stephen saw in the laird\u2019s eyes as he now spotted Gabrielle told the guard that he cared, even if just a little, about her.</p><p>Stephen prodded his friends\u2019 shoulders and ordered, \u201cGet out of the laird\u2019s way. Our princess is safe with him.\u201d</p><p>Colm paid no attention to her guards. His gaze was locked on Gabrielle, and he stopped just an arm\u2019s length from her. \u201cI would have a word with you, Gabrielle.\u201d His voice had a noticeable bite to it.</p> <p>The laird towered over her, and she retreated several steps so she would not have to crane her neck to look at him. \u201cWhat is it you wish to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part of our discussion this morning didn\u2019t you understand? I would like to know so that I may clarify it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiscussion? I don\u2019t believe it was much of a discussion. You gave orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich I expected you to obey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Her question sounded impudent, but he didn\u2019t believe that to be her intent. She really didn\u2019t understand, and though it had been a long while since anyone had asked him to explain himself, he allowed it.</p><p>\u201cBecause I have said so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t a sufficient answer. Why would you think I should obey your commands? I\u2019m not a member of your clan.\u201d</p><p>He was determined not to lose his patience with her. \u201cYou are to obey my commands because you will soon become my wife and, therefore, soon become a MacHugh.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t have been any more clear or concise, and she couldn\u2019t possibly have any more questions or arguments, for there was nothing more to argue about.</p><p>\u201cBut Laird, I never agreed to become your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a frustrating and aggravating woman,\u201d he snapped, \u201cand I suspect more stubborn than all the women here combined.\u201d</p><p>His insults were meant to make her realize that he was in charge, not she, and he was totally nonplussed by her response.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no prize, either, Laird. But unlike you, I don\u2019t feel it necessary to list your many faults.\u201d</p><p>She had the gall to smile at him. He damned near laughed, he was so stunned by her insolent behavior. The woman gave as good as she got. He guessed he was going to have to drag her back to his keep after all. He took a threatening step toward her and she didn\u2019t back away. She looked him right in the eye and waited to see what he would do.</p><p>She didn\u2019t cower, and that pleased him considerably. He decided he would try to gain her cooperation one last time before he resorted to carrying her back to his home to do his bidding.</p><p>\u201cWhile I understand that not wishing to marry me was your reason for leaving my home, I want you to understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted. \u201cThat isn\u2019t why I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what in God\u2019s name was your reason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ordered my guards to leave, and I couldn\u2019t allow that to happen. I tried to explain why they must stay with me, but you didn\u2019t want to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I left. What other choice did I have?\u201d she replied, and before he could start in on her again, she added, \u201cAnd yes, I was going to the Buchanans with the intent of pleading with my cousin to release you from your promise. My hope is that he will find something else for you to do to pay your debt to him, whatever that might be.\u201d</p><p>Speaking to the Buchanan on his behalf? Unthinkable...and appalling.</p><p>\u201cYou will not speak to anyone on my behalf. Is that understood?\u201d</p><p>She supposed she\u2019d inadvertently insulted him. She quelled his anger with a quick nod. \u201cI promise. In fact, I won\u2019t even mention you. I\u2019ll simply explain that my guards weren\u2019t allowed to stay, and so I left your holding.\u201d She turned and walked away from him.</p><p>He followed. \u201cNot speaking to him at all will satisfy me.\u201d</p><p>Then he wasn\u2019t going to be satisfied, she decided as she quickened her pace.</p><p>\u201cYou said I refused to listen to your explanation as to why your guards must stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that is so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hear your reasons now,\u201d he announced. \u201cBut I will tell you this, Gabrielle. English soldiers living with my men will not work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t English soldiers, and they would be highly insulted to hear you think they are. They\u2019re from St. Biel, and the emblem they wear over their hearts signifies that they are part of the royal guard.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle was so intent on making the laird understand, she didn\u2019t realize she was heading into a thick woods. Colm stayed right behind her, and twice he reached over her head to lift a branch out of her way.</p><p>\u201cMy mother was Lady Genevieve, princess of the royal house of St. Biel. When she married my father, guards accompanied her to her new home in England, and only when they became convinced that she was well-protected by her husband did they return to their country. My mother told me that at first Father wasn\u2019t happy to have them in his home, but in time he not only accepted them, he came to depend on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did it take for her guards to become convinced that your mother was well-protected?\u201d</p><p>She turned around to answer.</p><p>\u201cThree years. They stayed three years.\u201d Colm flinched. Irritated by his response, she was about to poke him in his chest, but thought better of it and stopped herself in time\u2014though he had to wonder why she was pointing her finger at him.</p><p>She put her hand behind her back. \u201cMy father was sorry to see them go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think perhaps you exaggerate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather trusted them,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cYou said that the guards returned to St. Biel after three years with your mother, yet now there are four guards with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month after I was born, four guards arrived at Wellingshire. They had been sent by my uncle, who was still the king. Their duty was clear. They were to protect me. Over time the guards have changed. Stephen has been with me the longest. Then Lucien came. Christien and Faust arrived a few years later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho sent them? England has ruled their country for many years now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe people of St. Biel. The English may occupy their land, but the people are still very loyal to my mother\u2019s family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStephen has called your mother Lady Genevieve, but you are called Princess Gabrielle. Was she not also a princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn St. Biel a princess isn\u2019t addressed as such. I should be called Lady Gabrielle. When I was a child, the guards called me Little Princess. The name has stayed with me. It doesn\u2019t matter now, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he agreed before moving on to another question.</p><p>\u201cWhy did it take four guards to look after one little girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne guard would have been enough,\u201d she said. \u201cThough my father would disagree. He insists that I liked to get into mischief, and it took all four of them to watch over me. I wasn\u2019t willful,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI was just curious.\u201d</p><p>She waited for him to comment, and when he remained silent, she continued. \u201cFather never worried about me as long as my guards were with me. They saved my life too many times to count.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle only just then realized she had no idea where she was. The forest was closing in on her.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if I refuse to let them stay? What will they do?\u201d Colm asked.</p><p>\u201cStay anyway. They\u2019ve taken an oath, and they are honor-bound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if staying means their death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven then,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut they would die with honor, and whoever kills them would have no honor at all.\u201d</p><p>Hell, he was going to be stuck with them. \u201cThey can stay, but they damn well better not take three years to figure out I can protect you.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle was overjoyed. Colm MacHugh was a good and reasonable man. \u201cThen I shall marry you, Laird, in six months\u2019 time. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>She leaned up on tiptoes to seal her promise with a kiss. Her lips barely brushed over his, but his surprise was evident in his expression. \u201cIt isn\u2019t appropriate to kiss like this?\u201d she asked. She could feel her face burning. She had acted impulsively and had obviously overstepped the bounds of propriety. She should have made a curtsy to seal her promise.</p><p>\u201cIt is appropriate,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cBut I prefer to kiss like this.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t grab her or wrap her in his arms. Nay, he simply lowered his head and kissed her senseless. His mouth covered hers completely. His warm lips parted and when she imitated him and parted her lips, he deepened the kiss. His tongue stroked hers, sending shivers through her. It was shocking and thrilling at the same time. And sinfully arousing.</p><p>One kiss was all it was, yet when he lifted his head, her heart was thundering in her ears and her legs were trembling so, she was afraid she was going to fall on her face. She had never been kissed like this before.</p><p>Gabrielle tried to read his eyes. Evidently, the kiss didn\u2019t have the same effect on him.</p><p>She lowered her head. \u201cIt is a good thing that we are alone. It isn\u2019t seemly to kiss as we just did without being married. It\u2019s probably a sin.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t sound too worried about it, he noticed. \u201cWe\u2019re soon to be married, so it isn\u2019t a sin, and we aren\u2019t alone.\u201d Without turning around, he called, \u201cStephen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Laird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many soldiers are watching us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI count seven.\u201d</p><p>Colm was disappointed. He expected the experienced guard to be more observant. \u201cNay. There are eight.\u201d</p><p>Stephen stepped forward. \u201cThere were eight watching. Seven now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to the eighth?\u201d</p><p>There was satisfaction in Stephen\u2019s voice when he answered. \u201cChristien happened to him. Your soldier wanted to follow our princess too closely. Christien didn\u2019t think he should, so he stopped him. He didn\u2019t kill him,\u201d he added. \u201cHe just put him to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Colm muttered something under his breath and strode back to the horses. Gabrielle would have had to run to keep up with him. When he noticed she wasn\u2019t behind him, he waited for her, then took hold of her hand and pulled her along, forcing her to keep up.</p><p>\u201cLaird, if you knew your men were watching, why did you kiss me so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoundly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is my right,\u201d he answered. \u201cAnd Gabrielle, since we are to be married, you may call me Colm.\u201d He didn\u2019t look back at her as he continued, \u201cAnd another thing, when we return to my home, you will not ever argue with me again. You and I have come to an agreement regarding your guards, but that is all I will concede. I cannot spend my days chasing after a stubborn wife. I have more important duties to see to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am never to argue or disagree with you?\u201d</p><p>That sounded good to him. He nodded. \u201cI will have your agreement now, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head. \u201cAs you say.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</p><p>T O SARAH TOBIAS, GOSSIP WAS AS ADDICTIVE AS SWEET BUTTER biscuits. She craved it. She loved being the first to spread the latest rumors and didn\u2019t care if the stories she repeated were true or false. The telling was all that mattered to her. By the time she reached the end of her tales, Sarah felt such a rush that her face was flushed, the palms of her hands were sweating, and her breath came in short gasps. Gossip, she had discovered, was every bit as good as sex. Sometimes even better. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sarah rarely spread stories about anyone\u2019s good works or good fortune. What was the point? There was nothing exciting about that. Sin was always much more fulfilling, and when the sin was one of lust, it became titillating as well.</p><p>One evening during supper her brother Niall happened to mention what he had heard about the incident at Arbane Abbey.</p><p>Sarah ate two biscuits listening to the tale, then gobbled down three more while she whittled every possible detail out of him. When Niall had finished relating what he had heard, Sarah was dizzy with excitement and stuffing the last biscuit into her mouth.</p><p>Before noon the following day everyone in the Dunbar clan knew about Gabrielle. Then Sarah, giddy with power, branched out. After baking a double batch of her sweet biscuits, she took them to her second cousin Hilda, who was married to a Boswell. She didn\u2019t leave the Boswell holding until she had made certain everyone in the clan knew about the infamous incident.</p> <p>Besides spreading vicious gossip, Sarah\u2019s other weakness was that she liked to embellish. After telling the story thirty or forty times, she no longer felt the same rush. Her heart didn\u2019t race, and her palms didn\u2019t sweat. The gossip had become old news, and so she began to add a few extra little lies of her own. Nothing outrageous, of course. Just enough to spice up the telling. What harm was there in that?</p><p>Two weeks later the lies had spread to the MacHugh clan.</p><p>Gabrielle felt the difference in the atmosphere. Women who usually smiled as they walked past now avoided looking at her. They turned their heads and scurried away. Before anyone told her, she knew that they had heard the horrible lies. And from the way they were behaving, she also knew they believed them to be true.</p><p>Colm returned home from a long day of hunting to find Braeden waiting for him in front of the stables. The look on his commander\u2019s face told Colm the news wasn\u2019t good. His first thought was for Gabrielle. Had something happened to her?</p><p>He hadn\u2019t even dismounted when he asked, \u201cIs Gabrielle all right?\u201d</p> <p>Braeden knew his laird didn\u2019t realize how telling the question was. \u201cShe\u2019s fine. No harm has come to her.\u201d</p><p>Colm\u2019s second question was just as revealing. \u201cWhat\u2019s she done now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing that I know of,\u201d he assured him.</p><p>Colm swung down from his horse and tossed the reins to the stablemaster as he addressed Braeden. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t tried to leave again?\u201d</p><p>Braeden smiled. \u201cNo, at least not today, anyway.\u201d He looked to the sky before adding, \u201cThe sun\u2019s still out, though. She still has time.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle was having trouble adjusting to her new home. Every day it was something new. In the past week she\u2019d tried to leave the holding twice, and twice Colm had had to bring her back. She\u2019d insisted she wasn\u2019t running away. Her first excuse was that she wanted to go riding across Finney\u2019s Flat. The second excuse was that she wanted to do a \u201cspot\u201d of hunting, whatever that meant.</p> <p>\u201cLady Gabrielle just needs time to understand the rules we live by here,\u201d Braeden said, trying to defend her.</p><p>Colm scoffed at the notion. \u201cShe knows the rules. She just doesn\u2019t pay any attention to them, which is why twice now I\u2019ve had to stop what I was doing to chase after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I point out that I offered to go after her, as did several other soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my responsibility and therefore my problem. I won\u2019t foist her on anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Braeden knew that wasn\u2019t the reason. Although Gabrielle had only been with them fourteen days, Colm had already become quite possessive of her. He didn\u2019t like anyone else near her. He barely tolerated her guards. As far as he was concerned, they were useless. They only answered to Gabrielle and only obeyed her commands. Colm believed he\u2019d put up with their behavior long enough, even though he grudgingly had to admit they did guard her well.</p><p>\u201cNone of us consider Lady Gabrielle a problem. The men are infatuated with her, and the women like her as well, for she has a kind word and a smile for everyone she meets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she distract the men from their duties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe does,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThough not deliberately. Have you had a chance, Colm, to notice how pretty she is?\u201d</p> <p>Exasperated, he answered, \u201cOf course I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe men have also noticed. They like looking at her.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cThen I\u2019ll double their duties. If they train from sun up to sun down, they won\u2019t have time to stare at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou speak like a jealous man.\u201d</p><p>From the dark look Colm shot him, Braeden realized he shouldn\u2019t have spoken the thought out loud.</p><p>\u201cI am your friend for many years,\u201d Braeden reminded him. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to rile you, only to speak truthfully. Word has spread that you are going to marry her, but if I could suggest, I think you should make the announcement to the entire clan soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a busy man,\u201d he barked.</p><p>Colm knew it was a poor excuse. He should have told his followers of his intention to take Gabrielle for his wife the day he had brought her home with him, but instead he had spent the last two weeks trying to stay away from her, telling himself that he had other duties that were far more important.</p><p>He could have made time for her. Colm wasn\u2019t one to avoid unpleasant tasks. He had a debt hanging over his head, and it would be paid as soon as he married her. And since he hated being in debt to anyone, he should have been eager to wed her. Why, then, wasn\u2019t he?</p><p>This morning he finally admitted the truth: Gabrielle was a dangerous woman. He didn\u2019t like the way she made him feel, turning his mind upside down. It started with a kiss. The damned kiss had awakened emotions he thought were long dead. The way she smiled at him only made it worse. She would turn him into a besotted fool if he let her, and no way in hell was he ever going to let another woman make him vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cI hope you will make the announcement soon, Laird.\u201d</p><p>Colm responded sharply. \u201cWhat is it you have to report?\u201d</p><p>As he asked the question, he noticed two horses tethered to a tree branch, and from the markings on their hindquarters he knew who they belonged to.</p><p>\u201cWhat in thunder are the Boswells doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpreading lies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat say you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lies about Lady Gabrielle have reached our clan, and two men from the Boswell clan are responsible. Kinnon Boswell claimed that he needed to speak to his cousin Rebecca, who as you know is married to one of our soldiers. He told the guards manning the tower that the matter was urgent, yet when he was allowed entrance, he didn\u2019t bother to go to her cottage. It seems both he and his friend Edward were determined to see Lady Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>Furious, Colm demanded, \u201cDid they see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they did not,\u201d he assured him.</p><p>Colm relaxed. \u201cThen they just might get out of here alive.\u201d</p><p>Braeden continued with his report. \u201cI was in the west field training the younger soldiers when one of Lady Gabrielle\u2019s guards came to me and told me there was a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucien.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least one of them is learning to follow the chain of command,\u201d he said drily. \u201cWhat did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked me if we were allies with the Boswells, and when I asked him why he wanted to know, he explained that he was about to kill two of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you let him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I swear to you, Laird, when I heard what they were saying about Lady Gabrielle, I wanted to. I was about to throw them out when you returned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Gabrielle now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the great hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind the Boswells,\u201d he ordered, \u201cand bring them to me. I want them to tell me what they\u2019ve been saying about Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>After giving the command, Colm continued on. He was in a hurry to get to Gabrielle before she heard about the Boswells. Gabrielle had been through enough heartache. She didn\u2019t need any more.</p><p>Damn it all, this was his fault. He should already have married her. That was the only sure way to stop this slander. No one would dare say a word against his wife...unless, of course, he had a death wish.</p><p>As he approached the courtyard, Colm spotted Gabrielle. Her back was to him and she was talking to someone. A few steps farther, Colm saw the Boswells facing her. He cursed as he quickened his step. The young men seemed so intent on what they were telling her, they didn\u2019t notice him. Nor did they hear Lucien and Faust coming up behind them. The guards were running toward the two men, but stopped when Gabrielle raised her hand slightly to signal them.</p><p>The action was noticed by Kinnon. He took a step toward her and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she answered. \u201cSaving your life.\u201d</p><p>Edward was slow to catch on, but Kinnon was more astute. He whirled around and came face-to-face with Lucien. Instantly he turned back to Gabrielle and with a shaky voice said, \u201cI was only telling you what everyone else was saying about you. I thought you would want to know. They can\u2019t kill us for that, can they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t, but I can,\u201d said Colm. Had he not been so angry, he probably would have thought their reaction to his voice comical. They jerked back and bumped into each other looking for a way to escape.</p><p>Gabrielle feared Colm might actually carry through on his threat and kill the Boswells, and she didn\u2019t want that to happen. Kinnon and Edward were stupid young men with nothing better to do with their time than to come all this way just to see her reaction to their stories, but they should not have to die because of their ignorance.</p><p>They should have to do some squirming, though.</p><p>\u201cLaird, I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re home,\u201d she said ever so sweetly. \u201cCome and listen to the stories the Boswells are telling me. You\u2019re certain to be amused.\u201d</p><p>Kinnon\u2019s face looked like it had been scorched by the sun, while Edward\u2019s appeared to have lost all color. He resembled a corpse. \u2019Twas the truth, he smelled like one, too.</p><p>\u201cI doubt I\u2019ll be amused,\u201d Colm said.</p><p>He threw his arm around her, pulled her to his side, and kissed her while the Boswells watched with wide eyes and gaping mouths. Then he turned and gave them his full attention.</p><p>\u201cI will hear what you have said to Lady Gabrielle, soon to be my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon to be...\u201d Kinnon swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cYour wife?\u201d Edward said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know. We never would have...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would not have slandered Lady Gabrielle? Is that what you mean to say?\u201d Colm asked.</p><p>He was so furious he could barely keep from strangling the fools. He was inadvertently squeezing Gabrielle instead, and only when she pinched him did he realize what he was doing and loosen his grip.</p><p>\u201cWe wanted to see what she looked like. We had heard she bewitches men and we wanted to see for ourselves,\u201d Kinnon explained.</p><p>\u201cWe were only repeating the stories we heard,\u201d Edward said, his voice so high-pitched it neared a screech.</p><p>Lucien and Faust moved closer to Kinnon and Edward, who surely felt them breathing down their necks. Both guards were watching Colm, hoping that he would give the signal to dispose of the pests.</p><p>Gabrielle felt the Boswells had been sufficiently punished. \u201cKinnon and Edward have both convinced me that I am an amazing woman. It seems that I have given birth to four children, out of wedlock of course, and all in the span of one year,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd with four different men.\u201d She laughed before adding, \u201cI must be very affectionate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stories are falsehoods,\u201d Kinnon stammered. \u201cWe realize that now. Don\u2019t we, Edward?\u201d</p><p>His friend nodded vigorously. \u201cWe do. Yes, we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we are allowed to leave, we promise never to say another word about Lady Gabrielle. Except praise,\u201d he hastened to add. \u201cWe will praise her. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucien, Faust, step back. Gabrielle, go inside,\u201d Colm ordered.</p><p>Gabrielle wanted to ask him what he was going to do, but knew it would be improper to question him in front of outsiders. He wasn\u2019t going to kill them, was he?</p><p>She took her time walking away. The Boswells had said terrible things, even repeating words she knew had to be foul because of their leers and dark laughter. She shouldn\u2019t feel sorry for them, but she did.</p><p>Colm noticed she was dragging her feet and decided he would have to have a word with her about her obedience. When he gave an order, he expected it to be followed immediately. And quickly. She obviously didn\u2019t know that. She was half English, he reminded himself, and perhaps that was why she was so headstrong.</p><p>He turned his attention to the Boswells, shaking in their boots.</p><p>\u201cWhen you wake up, you will go to your laird, and you will tell him what happened here today. I will know if you don\u2019t tell him every word you said to Lady Gabrielle. You will also tell him that the only reason I let you live was because you made my future wife laugh.\u201d</p><p>Edward nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell our laird every word,\u201d he vowed.</p><p>Kinnon scratched his chin. \u201cLaird, did you say when we wake up? Are we to stay\u2014\u201d</p><p>He never finished his question. Colm moved so fast, neither Kinnon nor Edward had time to react. One second they were standing, and the next they were crumpled on the ground.</p><p>Lucien nodded approval while Faust grinned.</p><p>Colm stared down at the Boswells as he ordered, \u201cTie them to their horses and get them the hell off my land.\u201d</p><p>Walking toward the forge a few minutes later, Colm was still furious. How dare the Boswells, or anyone for that matter, say slanderous things about Gabrielle? Anyone who met her knew she was an innocent, sweet, kind woman. He should have killed them, he decided. Gabrielle may have been upset, but it certainly would have lightened his mood.</p><p>He stopped abruptly. When had that happened? When had her feelings become important to him?</p><p>Colm tried to put Gabrielle out of his thoughts. He had work to do. He reached the forge and spent an hour with the smith discussing modifications he wanted made to the sword blades and then walked up to the crest overlooking the field where the men were sparring. The younger warriors were training. They held shields, but none of them were using them properly. A few were actually using them as weapons while their swords hung idly at their sides.</p><p>They shouldn\u2019t be training with any weapon yet, Colm concluded. They were too inexperienced. Braeden was bellowing at them, but wasn\u2019t getting the results he wanted. When one of the younger ones made the mistake of grinning, Braeden promptly knocked him to the ground. Why was it that the inexperienced were the most arrogant? On a battlefield they would be a hindrance, and the seasoned warriors would have to protect them as well as fight the enemy. The distraction could prove deadly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stephen and Christien walked over to stand beside Colm.</p><p>\u201cLucien told us what happened to the men from the Boswell clan,\u201d Stephen said.</p><p>Colm didn\u2019t acknowledge the comment. Then Christien said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill them? I would have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur princess would have been unhappy if they were killed,\u201d Stephen explained. \u201cI think that is why they\u2019re still alive.\u201d</p> <p>The three remained quiet as they watched the exercises on the field. One young soldier dropped his sword.</p><p>\u201cFor the love of God,\u201d Colm muttered. \u201cI should let them kill each other and be done with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should first learn to fight with their bare hands. They shouldn\u2019t be fighting with weapons.\u201d Christien voiced the criticism.</p><p>Colm nodded. Weapons could become crutches, and if disarmed, the warrior would be powerless against his enemy unless he possessed other skills. What in God\u2019s name was Braeden thinking to let them use swords? By day\u2019s end there would be severed limbs everywhere.</p><p>There were over a hundred clansmen on the field now, and that number didn\u2019t include the unskilled beginners. Braeden couldn\u2019t be in five places at the same time, and Colm realized he needed to delegate more responsibility to other worthy, seasoned warriors. No one would want to take on the beginners. Colm started back down the hill when an unexpected solution presented itself.</p> <p>\u201cStephen, I think it\u2019s time for you and the other guards to earn your keep here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve yet to see your skill on the field. Tomorrow you will spar with some of my warriors. If I think you\u2019re up to the duty, you will help train the young ones.\u201d</p><p>Colm didn\u2019t have to look at Christien to know he was smiling. Come morning he would knock some of that arrogance out of him.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</p><p>G ABRIELLE HAD BEEN IN A FINE MOOD UNTIL SHE STEPPED outside to get a bit of fresh air and met the Boswells. Kinnon and Edward had taken delight in sharing the stories they\u2019d heard about her. The tales were so outrageous she couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p> <p>The humor of the situation eluded her now. How could anyone get joy from saying terrible things about another person? There was no excuse for such cruelty. She pondered the sad fact as she climbed the stairs and entered the great hall. Her frame of mind had turned quite gloomy.</p><p>Though it wasn\u2019t logical, she decided to place the blame for her misery on Colm. She had been living with the MacHughs for two weeks, and if their laird had bothered to tell his clan that he was planning to marry her, word would have spread to the other clans by now, and the Boswells wouldn\u2019t have dared to taunt her.</p><p>But he hadn\u2019t told anyone, had he? There was only one conclusion she could draw from his silence. He didn\u2019t want to marry her, and he was so dreading it, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to say the words. He didn\u2019t even like being in the same room with her. Aside from lecturing her every now and then about something he felt she\u2019d done wrong, he hadn\u2019t had a decent conversation with her.</p><p>On one of her many walks with Father Gelroy she had discussed her concern about Colm. The priest suggested that she try to be more understanding. Colm\u2019s responsibilities as laird of his clan were sizable.</p><p>\u201cI do realize his clan comes first,\u201d she told him, \u201cand I am an outsider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey will come to love you,\u201d he assured her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t as certain. Patience wasn\u2019t one of her virtues. She decided she would give Colm one more week to make a formal announcement.</p><p>\u201cOne week. Then I\u2019ll leave this place and go where he will never find me.\u201d</p> <p>Voicing her thoughts made her feel better and more in control. She straightened her shoulders and walked across the hall to the bench where she\u2019d left her needlework.</p><p>\u201cDid you say something?\u201d Liam MacHugh asked the question.</p><p>Gabrielle was so surprised and pleased to see him, she didn\u2019t mind that he had heard her mumbling to herself.</p><p>\u201cGood day to you, Liam,\u201d she called out.</p><p>Colm\u2019s brother had been sprawled in one of two tall chairs flanking the fireplace. He stood as she crossed the room.</p><p>\u201cLady Gabrielle. Please, come and sit with me.\u201d</p><p>She took the chair on the other side of the hearth and noticed that Liam didn\u2019t grimace when he sat down. The cuts on the backs of his legs had obviously healed. There were a few wounds still visible just below his knees, but she didn\u2019t think he would carry the marks the rest of his life. The deep cuts on his back, however, would surely leave scars. Lucky for Liam, his face had been untouched. He actually looked quite fit.</p><p>\u201cFather Gelroy has told me all about you,\u201d he said, smiling.</p><p>\u201cHow is it that I have been here two weeks, and this is the first I\u2019ve seen you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to see anyone until I was stronger. I\u2019ve been up and about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling better?\u201d</p><p>Her concern seemed genuine to him. \u201cYes,\u201d he assured her. He studied her face for several seconds and then asked, \u201cAnd how is it that you seem so familiar to me? I know we have never met, for I would remember such a beautiful woman. Perhaps I dreamed of you. The guards who traveled with you watched over me while I slept. I must thank you for allowing them to do so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t need my permission, and they are the ones who should hear your gratitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re right,\u201d he agreed. He then repeated what the priest had told him about the royal guard and was curious to hear more. He was also interested in hearing about St. Biel, and Gabrielle was happy to answer his questions.</p><p>She liked him. Unlike his brother, Liam was easy to talk to and quite charming. Women must flock to him, she thought, because of his easy smile and his good looks. He also had a roguish sense of humor. He made her laugh telling stories about pranks he and Colm pulled when they were boys. Spending the afternoon with Liam was the most pleasant time she\u2019d had since arriving at the MacHugh holding. Best of all, Liam never mentioned the reason she was there, and for that she was most thankful.</p><p>GABRIELLE WAS ACCUSTOMED to eating her meals alone. That evening both Colm and Liam joined her. Colm, sitting at the head of the table, and Liam, sitting at the opposite end, stood when she entered the hall with Father Gelroy trailing behind. Liam beckoned to her while Colm, stone-faced as always, simply waited for her to sit down. She made a choice without giving it much thought. She smiled at Liam as she walked to Colm and took the seat adjacent to him.</p><p>Father Gelroy glanced in both directions before taking a chair next to Liam.</p><p>The room was quiet until Maurna carried in trenchers fashioned from day-old bread and filled with herring, salt cod, mutton, and salt beef. Last to be placed on the table were fat loaves of fresh brown bread. Still hot from the oven, the bread\u2019s aroma filled the hall.</p><p>Determined to engage Colm in conversation, she asked, \u201cLaird, how did your hunting go today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs expected.\u201d</p><p>She waited for him to elaborate, but he didn\u2019t seem inclined. She took the wedge of bread Father Gelroy offered her and tore off a piece as she tried to think of something else to talk about.</p><p>The men ate their meal in silence, while, occupied in thought, she continued to tear the bread into shreds.</p><p>Finally, Gabrielle spoke. \u201cWhat are your plans for tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was but curious.\u201d</p><p>Father Gelroy began to tell an amusing story, and Gabrielle looked down at the table. She\u2019d torn the bread into a million crumbs and made a mess. Thinking no one had noticed, she scooped up the crumbs and dropped handfuls onto the trencher.</p><p>Once the priest had finished his story, she turned to Colm and asked, \u201cIs the weather unusually mild this time of year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle was frustrated. Nothing was working. Surely there was a topic that would get his attention. She moved on to a question about the new addition being built.</p><p>Liam was talking quietly to the priest, but he heard what she asked and leaned forward to answer.</p><p>Gabrielle sighed and reached for another wedge of bread, but Colm stopped her by putting his hand on top of hers. His voice was whisper soft. \u201cWhy are you so nervous with me tonight?\u201d</p><p>Tonight? She was always nervous when she was with him. But why? There was no reason for this feeling, unless, of course, it was a purely physical reaction, which didn\u2019t make any sense at all. Of the two brothers, Liam was the good-looking one. He was the complete opposite in appearance and temperament from his brother, and yet it was Colm she was attracted to. There had to be something wrong with her, she decided, to prefer such a flawed and rude man.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, answer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I give you one-word answers like you\u2019ve been giving me? I have been trying to have a decent conversation with you.\u201d</p><p>Liam interrupted them. \u201cColm, did you find out anything about Monroe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are rumors but nothing of substance yet.\u201d</p><p>Liam looked from the priest to Gabrielle as he explained. \u201cLaird Monroe was murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know,\u201d Father Gelroy said. \u201cLady Gabrielle was supposed to marry the laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, she was. I heard about the marriage before I left the Monroe holding, not long before I was ambushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I ask why you were there?\u201d Gelroy said.</p><p>Liam smiled. \u201cI was meeting someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Gelroy prodded.</p><p>\u201cJust someone.\u201d</p><p>The priest was about to ask another question, but Liam stopped him when he said, \u201cA woman, Father. I was meeting a woman. I won\u2019t give you her name.\u201d</p><p>Gelroy blushed. \u201cIf only there was a chapel, you could go to confession.\u201d</p><p>Liam shrugged. \u201cDid you hear that the Monroes are fighting over who will be the next laird? Braeden believes there will be war among them.\u201d</p><p>For the next ten minutes the brothers debated who should take over leadership of the clan.</p><p>\u201cDo you think they will ever find out who killed the laird?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t rest until we find the culprit,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Father Gelroy inquired.</p><p>\u201cLairds Buchanan, Sinclair, Maitland, and MacHugh,\u201d he answered. \u201cThey have already come together to share information.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle hoped there would be justice for Laird Monroe. \u201cNo man should die from a knife in his back,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt is a cowardly act,\u201d Colm agreed.</p><p>She stared at his hand resting on top of hers. It was twice the size of hers and warm, wonderfully warm. How could a simple touch please her so? Was she so starved for affection that his nearness would evoke such a reaction? He probably wasn\u2019t even aware of what he was doing. Disgusted with herself, she turned away from him and listened to Fathery Gelroy telling about life at the abbey.</p><p>At every opportunity, Gelroy would make a comment or two about the benefits of having a chapel for the clan. He gave several examples, thinking he was being subtle.</p><p>\u201cA chapel would provide a holy and proper place to hear Liam\u2019s confession and to absolve him of any sins he may have committed with the Monroe woman,\u201d he assured Colm. \u201cAnd you, Laird,\u201d he continued, \u201cI could hear your confession anytime you wished...even twice a day if necessary.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle burst into laughter. \u201cFather, I think perhaps you should just ask our laird to build you a chapel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur laird?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>She lifted her shoulders and looked at Colm. \u201cIt would seem that you are Father Gelroy\u2019s laird now...and mine as well. Is that not so?\u201d</p><p>His expression was inscrutable when he answered. \u201cIt is so.\u201d</p><p>Liam frowned. \u201cAm I missing something here? Why is it so?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd are you thinking about building the priest a church?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he allowed.</p><p>\u201cThere are souls in need of saving here,\u201d Gelroy said with a pointed look at Liam.</p><p>\u201cBuilding a church will save our souls?\u201d Colm asked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cIt would be a step in the right direction. Your clan would have to be encouraged to go inside, get down on their knees, and pray God\u2019s forgiveness for their past sins.\u201d Wagging his finger at Liam, he added, \u201cAnd mean it...with a sincere heart. After what happened to you, I would think you would want to be in God\u2019s good graces.\u201d</p><p>In the blink of an eye the conversation turned serious. \u201cColm, Father has not been able to tell me how I got from Finney\u2019s Flat to the abbey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have walked,\u201d Gelroy suggested.</p><p>\u201cNo, I could not.\u201d</p><p>Gelroy sighed. \u201cI have already explained that I cannot tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know, don\u2019t you?\u201d Colm asked.</p><p>\u201cHave you found the men who hurt Liam?\u201d Gabrielle asked in a rush.</p><p>\u201cYou would know if I had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t give up searching, will you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve still to answer my question, Father,\u201d Liam said. \u201cYou do know how I got to the abbey, don\u2019t you? Were you perchance near Finney\u2019s Flat when I was there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot think this dear priest had anything to do with\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colm squeezed her hand. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t think he was involved. It\u2019s our hope that he might have seen the men who tried to kill Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was at the abbey before Liam came to us,\u201d Gelroy said.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re holding something back, and I want to know what it is,\u201d Colm demanded.</p><p>Gabrielle\u2019s mind raced. She had hoped to have a private moment with Colm to tell him that she was the one who shot Liam\u2019s attacker and that her guards had carried him to Arbane Abbey, but now he was forcing the issue.</p><p>\u201cI must tell you\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>He shot her a daunting look that stopped her from continuing. \u201cI\u2019m talking to the priest, Gabrielle. It\u2019s time for the truth.\u201d</p><p>Father Gelroy seemed to shrink in his chair, recoiling from the laird\u2019s anger.</p><p>\u201cWell, Father, what is it? Are you going to tell us, or do we have to resort to more forceful measures?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>Gabrielle bolted to her feet, upsetting her chair in her haste.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you would ask Father Gelroy to tell you what he cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCannot? Or will not?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cCannot,\u201d she snapped, glaring at him. \u201cI will not allow you to bully Father Gelroy. He\u2019s a man of the cloth. He has explained more than once that he cannot tell you. Leave him alone, or you will have to answer to me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Before anyone could respond to her outburst, Braeden appeared at the stairs and called out. \u201cThey\u2019re ready, Laird.\u201d</p><p>Colm reached down and picked up Gabrielle\u2019s chair and moved it to the side.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, Gabrielle,\u201d he ordered as he took her hand and pulled her behind him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t explain where he was leading her, but she was happy to oblige. A moment alone with him would give her the opportunity to explain what had happened at Finney\u2019s Flat.</p> <p>They were halfway to the entrance when Colm called over his shoulder, \u201cLiam, I\u2019m marrying Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>Liam was stunned. \u201cYou\u2019re getting married?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle\u2019s reaction was more intense. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even tell your brother? I\u2019ve been here two weeks, and you couldn\u2019t make time\u2014\u201d</p><p>He was all but dragging her toward the steps now. \u201cI have seen my brother as often as you have in the past two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t an acceptable excuse,\u201d she muttered.</p> <p>Exasperated, he pulled her along down the stairs. \u201cI don\u2019t make excuses.\u201d</p><p>A soldier stood at the door. When he saw them coming, he bowed to Gabrielle and pulled the door open. She thought his action most peculiar. He should have shown deference to his laird, not her.</p><p>A blast of cold air brushed over her face. Colm let go of her and walked outside. He stopped on the top step and beckoned her to come to him.</p><p>The golden light of sunset spilled over a sea of faces watching her. The courtyard was filled with his clan, and more of them covered the hills beyond.</p><p>Gabrielle was so shocked, she could barely keep her wits about her. There seemed to be a thousand men and women staring at her. She tried to catch her breath. No one was smiling. She noticed that right away. Oh, no, had the Boswells gotten to all of these people? She pushed the horrid thought aside. But why did they all look so somber? Since they were crowded together, she couldn\u2019t see if they were holding anything in their hands.</p><p>She moved closer to Colm. Her arm brushed his. She looked up and whispered, \u201cAm I about to be stoned again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor the love of...\u201d He stopped. He couldn\u2019t be angry with her. Of course she would expect the worst. He hadn\u2019t told her what was going to happen, and God knows, after what she\u2019d been through in the last few weeks, why wouldn\u2019t she be frightened?</p><p>\u201cDo you think I would let anyone harm you? You belong to me now, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>Colm turned to his followers, raised one hand high into the air, and said, \u201cAfter much deliberation, Lady Gabrielle has finally agreed to become my wife. I am fortunate to marry such a passionate and spirited, beautiful and innocent lady. You will welcome her and honor her as you honor me.\u201d</p><p>The crowd erupted into cheers and shouts. All of them were smiling now. Colm pulled her into his arms, tilted her chin up, and kissed her.</p><p>She was overwhelmed. He only kissed her long enough for her to want more, and when he lifted his head, she trembled. The noise swirled around her, and there was but one thought in her mind: there weren\u2019t any stones.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</p><p>C OLM HADN\u2019T GIVEN HER ANY WARNING. HAD GABRIELLE known he was going to call his clan together to make his announcement, she would have changed her gown and brushed her hair. She didn\u2019t even have time to pinch her cheeks to give them color. The door opened, and there they all were, staring at her.</p><p>An astonished Liam had followed them outside and stood on Colm\u2019s right as he spoke to the clan. Liam seemed pleased by what he called \u201cremarkable news.\u201d Once the cheering had died down and the crowd had dispersed, he slapped his brother on the shoulder and hugged Gabrielle.</p> <p>\u201cI thought Gabrielle was our guest because of the help her guards gave me at the abbey, but it appears there\u2019s much more to this visit.\u201d He laughed and gave Colm a shove as they headed back inside. \u201cYou\u2019ve been holding out on me, brother. Just how long did I sleep? Evidently I\u2019ve been missing a great deal. I must hear the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain another time,\u201d Colm said.</p><p>Liam took Gabrielle\u2019s hand and with a wink said, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019ve chosen the right MacHugh, Gabrielle? Colm can be a bear to live with, you know. Perhaps you should reconsider.\u201d</p><p>Colm answered. \u201cThere is nothing to reconsider, Liam. Gabrielle is quite happy.\u201d He turned to her. \u201cAren\u2019t you, Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy...I...\u201d How could she answer him? Happy? With all that had occurred in the past two weeks, thoughts of happiness had not entered her mind.</p><p>Liam saved her from coming up with an answer. \u201cNeed I pester Lady Gabrielle for details?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you need not,\u201d Colm replied firmly.</p><p>Gabrielle was relieved when Liam bid them good night and went upstairs. She didn\u2019t want to answer any questions. There was a more pressing matter on her mind. The time had come for her to face Colm with the truth. She needed to be alone with him. Her heart started pounding.</p><p>\u201cColm...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look exhausted, Gabrielle. Get some rest.\u201d Dismissing her, he headed for the door.</p><p>She followed him. \u201cMay I have a word with you? There is something I must tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan it wait?\u201d He pulled a torch from its wall bracket to take outside.</p><p>The door swung open and Braeden and Stephen entered. She hoped they would pass through, but neither did. They waited to speak to Colm. He was a busy man with many responsibilities and burdens, she reminded herself.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to...that is to say...I suppose I could wait until tomorrow. Perhaps early in the morning?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Colm nodded, and Gabrielle, feeling weak with relief because she wouldn\u2019t have to tell him tonight, hurried up the steps.</p><p>Father Gelroy was waiting to offer his congratulations, but she didn\u2019t give him the chance. She motioned for him to come closer and then whispered, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I haven\u2019t told Colm yet. I have twice tried to explain that I and my guards brought Liam to the abbey, but both times we have been interrupted. I think it best if I tell him in private. You had to suffer his anger, and Liam\u2019s, too, because of the promise I forced on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe longer you wait, the harder the telling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know, but I do dread it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaird MacHugh will be pleased to know that you found his brother and sought help for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is more to the telling than you know, but have no worries. By tomorrow night, Colm will know everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs will I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She had hoped to tell him in confession, but if she did, she would have to say she was sorry for taking a man\u2019s life, and God would know she wasn\u2019t sincere.</p><p>That man had really needed killing.</p><p>MAURNA WAS THRILLED that Gabrielle was going to marry their laird and told her so several times while serving breakfast.</p><p>\u201cNo one believed that foolishness the Boswell boys were spouting, and we were right not to pay them any mind since our laird is making you his wife. He declared you innocent, milady, but we already knew it. Didn\u2019t we, Willa?\u201d she called over her shoulder.</p><p>The cook peeked out from the buttery. \u201cWe did. We surely did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thank you both for your faith in me.\u201d Gabrielle stared down at a bowl of what appeared to be a thick gray paste.</p><p>\u201cNo lady as holy as you are would commit such terrible sins, and besides, our laird wouldn\u2019t be marrying you if those sins were true...which they aren\u2019t,\u201d she hastened to add.</p><p>Willa brought out bread and put it next to the paste. \u201cYou eat up now. You could stand to put some fat on those bones.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle didn\u2019t want to hurt the cook\u2019s feelings, but she had to ask what the paste was before she put any of it in her mouth. It would be more hurtful, she thought, if she started gagging.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you call this, Willa?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBreakfast.\u201d</p><p>Maurna brushed some crumbs from the table onto her open hand. \u201cYou take your bread, and you dab it in the mush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMush?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good for you, milady,\u201d Willa insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s made with cooked oats and some of my special spices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave you alone so you can eat while it\u2019s warm,\u201d Maurna said.</p><p>Gabrielle reluctantly picked up her spoon and dipped it into the thick goo. \u201cMaurna, could you explain what you meant when you said no one was as holy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think I was holy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just me, milady. Everyone thinks it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it,\u201d Willa said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposing it\u2019s because you spend so much of your time walking with Father Gelroy. You\u2019re praying with him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cGoodness, no. Father has been rather lonely, and that is why I\u2019ve been walking with him, but we\u2019re both getting accustomed to our new surroundings and feeling more comfortable now. Everyone is so friendly.\u201d</p><p>The two women beamed at her praise for their clan.</p><p>\u201cYour breakfast is getting cold on you,\u201d Willa warned.</p><p>\u201cI thought I might wait for our laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been up and gone quite some time now.\u201d</p><p>When the women left her alone to eat the mush, Gabrielle forced herself to try it and was surprised that it wasn\u2019t vile. In fact, it didn\u2019t have much taste at all.</p><p>She finished quickly and then went looking for Colm. The man must get up at the crack of dawn, she thought.</p><p>Faust caught up with her as she was heading to the stables. \u201cWhere are you going, Princess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for Colm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in the fields with his soldiers. Would you like to sit on the hill and watch the sparring?\u201d he asked eagerly.</p><p>Faust obviously wanted to watch, and since she couldn\u2019t talk to Colm until later, she decided to accommodate her guard.</p><p>\u201cLead the way, Faust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you will enjoy watching, Princess. I know I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand your enthusiasm. You\u2019ve seen my father\u2019s men training nearly every day at Wellingshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey did train almost every day, and for good reason, for they, like all good vassals, must keep their skills sharpened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, in England, a knight\u2019s primary duty is to protect his liege lord. I think it must be the same here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s different. I think as long as they win, most barons don\u2019t care how many men die fighting for them, but MacHugh would take it as a personal affront if he lost one man or twenty.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her skirts and quickened her step to keep up with him. \u201cDo you think you will learn new techniques by watching today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but that isn\u2019t the reason for my eagerness. You will understand soon enough. We\u2019ll sit high on the hill between the two fields where we\u2019ll have a good view.\u201d</p><p>Faust led her up a worn path winding through the trees; it was a steep incline. When she reached the ridge, a panoramic view of the fields opened up below her.</p><p>There were two fields almost of equal dimension and separated by mounded stacks of hay. On one side the archers practiced accuracy. Their targets were so far away it was difficult to see the center. Next to them men were throwing axes at targets. As far as she was from the field, Gabrielle could still hear the whistle of the heavy weapons slicing through the air. On the other field, men sparred with swords and shields. Circling them were rows of clansmen, young and old, waiting for their chance to demonstrate their skills.</p><p>There were at least a hundred men on the field, yet she easily spotted Colm. He was by far the most impressive warrior there. He stood at the far end of the circle, arms across his chest and feet braced apart. Even from her vantage point, Gabrielle saw his scowl, indicating he didn\u2019t like what he was seeing.</p><p>She stared in fascination. His bronzed skin glistened with sweat, and the bulging muscles in his upper arms and legs exuded raw power. While she knew it was indecent for her to notice such things, she couldn\u2019t make herself look away.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to fetch a blanket for you to sit on? Or do you think you will not want to stay that long?\u201d Faust asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a blanket,\u201d she replied, sitting down. She tucked her legs under her and adjusted her skirt; all the while her violet blue eyes were fixed on Colm.</p><p>\u201cDo you see Stephen? He stands next to the laird.\u201d Faust pointed him out.</p><p>\u201cI see him. What\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s watching Lucien spar.\u201d</p><p>She searched the field and located her guard. \u201cAnd why is Lucien sparring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe laird invited him to,\u201d Faust answered. \u201cIf he thinks we are capable, he will have us train the beginners. His seasoned warriors find it all beneath them, though of course they would do whatever their laird ordered them to. Stephen says the laird wants us to earn our keep, and we are happy to oblige.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle watched Lucien. Her guard\u2019s movements were fluid and graceful. He held his own against the MacHugh soldier without seeming to exert much effort. Neither gained an advantage.</p><p>\u201cStephen bested all the others with bow and arrow. The laird wouldn\u2019t give him time to fetch his own, so he had to use Braeden\u2019s. I think you could best them all, too, Princess.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYour faith in me is misplaced. Tell me this, Faust, what did the laird and his commander think of Stephen defeating their soldiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were impressed with his skill. Braeden and Stephen aren\u2019t adversaries. They respect each other\u2019s ability and have, in fact, become friends of a sort. The laird has placed Stephen in charge of training the young ones with bow and arrow under Braeden\u2019s watchful eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cI will spar tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t sit here with me. You will know I\u2019m safe. You can see me from either field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe distance is too great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can see Colm\u2019s frown, you\u2019ll certainly be able to see me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow will be soon enough to take my turn. Besides, Christien will be fighting soon, and I don\u2019t want to miss that. Lucien\u2019s almost finished,\u201d he added with a nod toward the guard. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to let the MacHugh soldier best him this day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe should have finished him by now. He\u2019s holding back because the man he fights is older by at least fifteen or more years. Lucien won\u2019t humiliate him in front of his laird. It\u2019s what I would do.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Next to the combatants, Stephen had made the same observation. He stepped back and spoke to Braeden. A few minutes later, Colm stopped the match. New opponents moved forward to take their places on the field.</p><p>\u201cLucien, come here,\u201d Colm commanded.</p><p>The guard ran to him. \u201cYes, Laird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStephen has suggested that you didn\u2019t put your full strength in your fight. Is that true?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>Colm expected to hear an excuse and was surprised by his honesty. \u201cGive me your reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is my elder by many years. I didn\u2019t want to embarrass him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is the most ridiculous reason I\u2019ve yet to hear. Am I to assume that if an old man were to attack Gabrielle, you would be considerate of his age as you try to protect her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I would kill him if he tried to harm my princess, no matter what his age.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou insult my clansmen when you do not give your best. Tomorrow I will see that you do.\u201d</p><p>Colm gave the command, and the swords and shields were put aside. There would be hand-to-hand combat now. Groups of experienced warriors took the field. Each man\u2019s goal was to pin the other to the ground. Cunning as well as raw strength were required, and several times during the challenges Colm intervened to show the combatants their mistakes.</p><p>Christien joined Stephen to watch. \u201cThey don\u2019t fight like us.\u201d</p><p>Colm heard his remark and called to him. \u201cShow me the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Laird, but I must decline.\u201d He sounded disheartened when he added, \u201cI cannot fight you.\u201d</p><p>Astounded by the guard\u2019s refusal, Colm asked, \u201cWhy is it you think you have a choice?\u201d</p> <p>Stephen stepped forward to explain. \u201cNow that you are betrothed to marry our princess Gabrielle, none of her guard can fight you.\u201d</p><p>Christien nodded. \u201cWe must protect you now just as we protect our princess.\u201d</p><p>Braeden took offense. \u201cThe laird\u2019s warriors protect him.\u201d</p><p>Stephen nodded. \u201cYes, and we protect the man who will marry Princess Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>Christien glanced up at the crest of the hill where Gabrielle was sitting. \u201cBesides, she would not like to see us sparring with you. She is beginning to have affection for you.\u201d</p><p>Colm looked up and saw Gabrielle watching. She was beginning to care for him? Not likely. The guard was wrong. A woman who cared about a man didn\u2019t run him in circles and ignore his every command.</p><p>He pushed his thoughts aside. \u201cIf you cannot fight me, Christien, then you will fight someone else.\u201d</p><p>He motioned to one of his clansmen. A thick-necked warrior immediately stepped forward.</p> <p>\u201cEwen, tell Christien how old you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaird?\u201d</p><p>Colm repeated the command. Ewen, though puzzled by the odd order, quickly obeyed. He and Christien were only months apart in age.</p><p>\u201cI trust Ewen isn\u2019t too old for you to fight,\u201d Colm said sardonically.</p><p>The two men went to opposite sides of the field. Braeden gave the signal, and Ewen, head down, charged. Christien met him in the center, and before the MacHugh soldier could get in a punch, Christien spun on one foot and used the flat of his other foot to slam him to the ground.</p><p>Christien waited several seconds to see if Ewen was going to get up. When he didn\u2019t, the guard walked over to him and offered him his hand. Ewen pushed his hand aside, stood, and shook his head to clear it. He charged again. And again. It was painful to watch, and irritating as hell for Colm. After Ewen had been knocked to the ground for a fourth time, Colm strode onto the field, hauled the battered man to his feet with one hand, and gave him a good shove.</p><p>\u201cFour times Christen has flattened you the very same way. Haven\u2019t you figured out that you need to come up with another way to attack?\u201d</p><p>Ewen frowned. \u201cI knew he was going to kick me with his foot again, but I thought I could be quicker.\u201d</p><p>Colm shoved him again. \u201cObviously you were not quicker, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you try to block the attack?\u201d</p><p>Colm showed him how it could be done, but Ewen was a slow learner, and twice more Christien knocked him down using the same method.</p><p>Three other soldiers met Ewen\u2019s fate. Then the more experienced clansmen challenged Christien. The second man not only blocked his attack, but he landed a good punch to the guard\u2019s middle. Christien fell to the ground. The next time Christien changed his maneuver and felled this worthier opponent.</p><p>Colm ordered Christien to try both techniques on him so that he could show his soldiers how to block the attack and gain the advantage. The laird was much quicker than Christien. The third time Colm sent the guard flying backward, Christien landed on his stomach, rolled over, and sat up. Blood trickled from the corner of his mouth. He wiped it away, looked up at Colm, and began to laugh.</p><p>\u201cAgain, Laird?\u201d he asked as in one motion he gained his feet.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game, Christien,\u201d he snapped. \u201cTomorrow you will help train the younger soldiers.\u201d He pointed a finger at him and added, \u201cBefore then, I suggest you rid yourself of your arrogance. In battle, these men won\u2019t get second chances. It\u2019s your duty to teach them how to survive. When they\u2019re ready, Braeden and I will teach them how to win.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</p><p>A FTER THE TRAINING SESSION, COLM WENT TO THE LAKE and washed the sweat from his body, then headed toward the great hall. He was walking past the stables just as Gabrielle led her horse out of a stall. The steed was already saddled.</p><p>He stopped outside the gate and watched her. She brushed a loose strand of hair from her face as she closed the gate behind Rogue.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Colm asked.</p><p>Startled, Gabrielle glanced in his direction. \u201cGood day to you, Colm.\u201d</p><p>If she was trying to get him to waste his time on pleasantries, she was in for a disappointment.</p><p>\u201cI asked you a question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going riding. Rogue needs to stretch his legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where exactly are you planning to ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere and there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAcross Finney\u2019s Flat perchance?\u201d</p><p>It seemed he could read her mind. \u201cYes. I thought I would pay Laird Buchanan a visit. I would like to meet his wife. I am related to her, if you\u2019ll remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not to leave this holding. You can ride in the hills here, but you will not leave the mountain.\u201d Clasping his hands behind his back, he said, \u201cI will have your word.\u201d</p><p>She bowed her head. \u201cAs you say.\u201d</p><p>Colm turned away from the stables and started toward the courtyard, then stopped. He turned and looked at his betrothed. She stood next to the horse, holding Rogue\u2019s reins and waiting for Colm to walk away. He knew exactly what she was doing. Once he was out of sight, she would head to Finney\u2019s Flat.</p><p>\u201cOh no, Gabrielle. You\u2019re not pulling that on me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>He walked back to her. \u201cDon\u2019t play the innocent with me. I know that \u2018as you say\u2019 means that you\u2019re going to do whatever you damn well want to do. You will now give me your promise. You will say \u2018I give you my word,\u2019 and you will mean it.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle was not about to let him intimidate her. He wasn\u2019t the only one who had something to be cross about. She took a bold step toward him.</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to set aside a moment of your time this morning, for I have something important to tell you, but when I came downstairs, you were gone. Did you wait at all?\u201d</p><p>He stepped in her direction.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t spend half my morning waiting for you to wake up. Get up earlier, and I\u2019ll listen to what you have to say.\u201d</p><p>Stubbornly, she moved forward. \u201cYou are an aggravating man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you have yet to give me your promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise,\u201d she said with a hint of defiance.</p><p>They were now so close she felt his warm breath. \u201cI want your promise to set aside some time tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cI must speak to you in private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t private.\u201d</p><p>He put his hands on her shoulders and pulled her toward him. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I will ever get along with such a stubborn woman.\u201d</p><p>His mouth brushed hers when she whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>He meant to give her only a brief kiss, but once his mouth covered hers, his intentions changed. Her lips were so soft and warm. At his insistence, she opened her mouth for him, and the kiss deepened as he wrapped his arms around her and pressed her tightly against him.</p><p>For Gabrielle, the world ceased to exist. There was only Colm\u2019s magical touch. She returned his kiss with a passion she hadn\u2019t known she possessed.</p><p>He came to his senses before she did and abruptly ended the kiss. He took a deep shuddering breath. She was so dazed she didn\u2019t realize she was clinging to him until he gently pulled away.</p><p>Colm had to put some distance between them before he gave in to temptation and kissed her again. He knew exactly where that would lead, and he wasn\u2019t about to dishonor Gabrielle and take her to his bed before their marriage, but she wasn\u2019t making it easy for him to walk away. No woman had ever affected him so deeply.</p><p>He grabbed her horse\u2019s reins, pulling Rogue closer to lift Gabrielle onto the saddle. With a slap on the horse\u2019s hindquarters, Colm sent her on her way.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</p><p>C OSWOLD\u2019S SEARCH FOR GABRIELLE BEGAN THE MOMENT she was banished. He spent several days canvassing the area around the abbey, but she was nowhere to be found.</p><p>His spies told him that Percy was also in pursuit, but it wasn\u2019t long before he gave up. No surprise there, Coswold thought. Percy was, and always would be, a quitter. He had, no doubt, returned to King John to whine about how unjustly he\u2019d been treated.</p><p>Coswold was not that easily discouraged. Thinking that Gabrielle had no alternative but to go home, he headed south, speeding in the direction her servants had taken. He intercepted their caravan near the English border where they had made camp for the night. After hours of threats and bullying, Coswold was finally convinced they knew nothing. He allowed the frightened band of travelers to continue on their journey, but not before he confiscated Gabrielle\u2019s trunks, claiming that they should be held at Arbane Abbey until such time that Gabrielle would come to fetch them.</p><p>Frustrated but not deterred, he returned to the Highlands. Gabrielle was hiding somewhere in this uncivilized, godforsaken land, and Baron Coswold would find her.</p><p>In the week that followed, he spent most of his time watching and listening. The rumors were many, and with each scrap of information Coswold became more convinced that Gabrielle had remained in the Highlands.</p><p>One rumor persisted. Coswold heard thirdhand that Gabrielle had been taken in by the MacHugh clan, but he was unsure how to make certain the information was correct. The Highlanders were a close-knit group, and Coswold knew that if he sent out inquiries on her whereabouts, word would reach Laird MacHugh in no time at all, and the laird would hide Gabrielle away where no one could find her. The risk was too great. The baron had spent a good deal of time coming up with a plan to lure Gabrielle into the open.</p><p>He was ready for his next step: verifying that Gabrielle was indeed with the MacHughs. For this, he called on Laird MacKenna. The laird knew men who would not be recognized in this part of the Highlands and who would do anything for money. Once MacKenna\u2019s men were gathered in front of him, Coswold explained what he wanted done.</p><p>\u201cThe plan is simple,\u201d he told the men. \u201cYou will carry Gabrielle\u2019s things to the MacHugh holding. You will insist on seeing Gabrielle before handing them over. Explain that you must be certain she receives them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if they won\u2019t let us see her?\u201d one of the men asked.</p><p>\u201cTell them the order came from the abbot. That her trunks had been returned to the abbey and that he had been holding them in safekeeping until he knew where she was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do when we\u2019ve seen her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do nothing,\u201d Coswold stressed. \u201cLeave her things with her, return to me, and receive your payment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPayment of gold and women?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if she ain\u2019t there?\u201d another asked.</p><p>\u201cThen you will bring her things back to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill we still get paid in coin and women?\u201d</p><p>Coswold assured them that they would, and sent them on their way. He didn\u2019t anticipate any problems. His plan was flawless.</p><p>Nothing could go wrong.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</p><p>T WO MORE DAYS PASSED WITHOUT THE PROMISED MEETING, and Gabrielle still hadn\u2019t had an opportunity to speak to Colm in private. No matter how early she got up in the morning, he was already gone. And when he came in late at night, he took his meals alone, then disappeared.</p><p>She was beginning to think he never went to bed, but he didn\u2019t look as if he lacked sleep\u2014unless she considered his mood an indicator. In the brief encounters they\u2019d had in passing, he\u2019d either ignored her or had grumbled about something she had done to displease him.</p><p>She had convinced herself that he was deliberately avoiding her, but then Maurna changed her mind. The housekeeper was in a chatty mood as she swept the hall on that third morning.</p><p>\u201cThe laird has not had a minute\u2019s peace since Liam was taken,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cHe says he won\u2019t rest until he finds the men responsible. He\u2019s led men out every day looking for anyone who knows something.\u201d Maurna moved a stool aside as she continued. \u201cAnd then word came three days ago that thieves had stolen cattle from Seamus MacAlister\u2019s valley, so the laird and his men have been out searching for those culprits as well. He didn\u2019t find them until yesterday...and if those worries aren\u2019t enough, he arrived home last night to find a war brewing between Heckert, the smith, and Edwin, the butcher. Those two are always at odds about something...\u201d</p><p>She chattered on and on about various incidents involving the laird, and Gabrielle listened patiently. She was tremendously relieved to discover that she was not the reason he was absent, but she was also anxious to find a time to talk to him. Gabrielle was becoming desperate to unburden her conscience.</p><p>She felt so alone. There was no one she could confide in or share her problems with. Most nights she would have supper with Liam, and spend the evening playing a table game. His favorite was Fox and Geese, and he would rush to get the board and pegs the minute the trenchers had been cleared away. Gabrielle enjoyed his company, but their conversation never turned to serious matters. She couldn\u2019t tell him about her role in his rescue. Colm was the laird, the man who had taken her in, the man who would marry her. She should first tell him her startling news. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t want to burden Father Gelroy with her worries. There wasn\u2019t anything he could do about it anyway, except worry with her, and what would that accomplish? She had not spent much time with the priest these last few days. Now that he was trusted by the clan, he was invited into their homes to eat with the families and to bless their children. He was kept very busy and seemed to thrive on the new demands on his time.</p><p>Nor could she talk with her guards. It wouldn\u2019t be proper to pour her heart out to them. She would never burden them with her problems.</p><p>She fretted in silence.</p><p>Her main concern was for her father. Was he safe? Or had the king already imprisoned him? Oh God, she prayed, please keep him from harm. Had Baron Geoffrey had time to gather his vassals, and if he did, would they fight against the king\u2019s favored barons and their armies? Brodick had suggested that once her father heard that Gabrielle was still in the Highlands, he would rush to the Buchanans. But she had heard nothing from them. If her father was safe, why hadn\u2019t he sent word?</p> <p>Gabrielle couldn\u2019t wait any longer. Tomorrow she would go to the Buchanans. Brodick knew her father, and he might offer some suggestions to help find him.</p><p>She didn\u2019t worry that Colm would deny her permission to leave the holding because she wasn\u2019t going to ask him.</p><p>Gabrielle strolled toward the fields as she formulated her plan. Cheers coming from the hill drew her attention. She looked to its crest. Several people\u2014some old, some young\u2014were gathered under the tree where she had recently sat with Faust, watching Colm and his soldiers\u2019 exercises.</p><p>A girl running to join her friends paused long enough to curtsy to Gabrielle, then dashed away as her friend called to her. \u201cLiam is back in training today,\u201d she announced. \u201cHe\u2019s feeling ever so much better.\u201d</p><p>And he was looking ever so much better to the girls, too, Gabrielle thought. Eventually Liam would settle down, and God help the woman he chose for his wife. Most certainly she would have her hands full with his mischief.</p> <p>Gabrielle hurried down the hill. Her stomach grumbled, reminding her that it was the noon hour. Maurna had served her that paste for breakfast again, and Gabrielle had been unable to make herself eat more than two bites. Willa had urged Gabrielle to eat it all, claiming it would stick to her ribs. Why Gabrielle would want that to happen was beyond her. She thought the very idea disgusting.</p><p>She had almost reached the courtyard when a woman approached from behind and tapped her on her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cLady Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle turned. \u201cYes?\u201d There was a time when she would have had a ready smile, but no longer. She had since learned caution and was now wary meeting anyone new.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to meet you,\u201d the pretty woman said. \u201cMy name is Fiona, and I come from the Dunbar clan. My father is Laird Dunbar. I was recently married. Devin, my husband, is one of Laird MacHugh\u2019s most trusted clansmen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is my pleasure to meet you.\u201d Gabrielle was polite but tentative with her response.</p> <p>Fiona didn\u2019t smile. She was a hearty woman, with a ruddy complexion, freckles, and green eyes the color of new grass. Her long, red, curly hair was, without a doubt, her best feature. Her eyes slanted down at the corners, giving her a look of overwhelming sadness.</p><p>\u201cBy now I\u2019m sure you know who my sister is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe so. Is she also married to a MacHugh?\u201d</p><p>Fiona acted surprised, though Gabrielle could see through her pretense. \u201cWhat is it you wish to say to me?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cMy sister Joan is betrothed to Laird MacHugh.\u201d</p><p>Had the woman wanted to shock Gabrielle, she\u2019d accomplished her goal.</p><p>But Gabrielle recovered quickly. \u201cBe sure to give your sister my congratulations.\u201d</p><p>Fiona\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYes...I will.\u201d</p> <p>As Gabrielle walked away, Fiona called out to her, \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to meet her yourself soon. Joan will be here in a few days.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle pretended not to hear. She saw Lucien waiting for her in the courtyard and rushed toward him.</p><p>\u201cPrincess, your face is bright red, but it isn\u2019t warm enough today for the sun to burn you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wind makes my face red,\u201d she explained, surprised at how calm she sounded. Inside she was seething. \u201cDo you happen to know where Laird MacHugh is?\u201d I wish to kill him, she silently added.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Would you like me to find him for you?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll let him live a little longer.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t realize she had spoken the thought out loud until Lucien asked her to repeat it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find him later,\u201d she said. Then I\u2019ll kill him.</p><p>\u201cDid you want to go riding this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll stay inside and finish my needlework. It\u2019s relaxing and gives me something useful to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t need me, I\u2019ll go help Faust. He\u2019s making arrows and fashioning them like the MacHughs\u2019. Theirs are so much stronger and thinner, which allows for more distance and speed. You\u2019ll have to try one, Princess. You\u2019re sure to be impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that much difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get one of mine and one of theirs to show you.\u201d</p><p>A short time later Lucien came into the hall carrying two arrows. He placed them on the table. Gabrielle had just finished eating a wedge of coarse brown bread with honey. She pushed her trencher aside and took the MacHugh arrow in her hands to feel the weight.</p><p>\u201cThe shaft is thinner, but seems to be strong. The fletchings are strange to me.\u201d</p><p>Maurna heard her mistress\u2019s comment. She hurried to the table to clear away the food, and leaning over Gabrielle\u2019s shoulder said, \u201cLooks to be from a goose to me.\u201d</p><p>Their attention was drawn to the stairs, as Colm and Liam entered the hall together. Gabrielle placed the arrow on the table and turned to the brothers.</p><p>\u201cThere is good news,\u201d Liam said. \u201cYour clothes and much more will arrive shortly. There is quite a procession of men carrying the goods. Surely they can\u2019t all be garments, can they?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle was puzzled and directed her questions to Colm. \u201cHow is that possible? The staff took my possessions back to Wellingshire. How can they be here now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey came from the abbey,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\u201cDid my father send them back? Is there word from him?\u201d Her face lit up with excitement over the possibility.</p><p>Colm hated to disappoint her. \u201cNo, there is no word from your father.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes quickly filled with tears. \u201cI had hoped...\u201d</p><p>Liam elbowed Colm and tilted his head toward Gabrielle.</p><p>\u201cCome here, Gabrielle,\u201d Colm commanded.</p><p>She blinked her tears away, straightened her shoulders, and crossed the room to face him. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you will hear something from your father tomorrow,\u201d Liam suggested when Colm stayed silent.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said softly. And perhaps the sun will turn black tomorrow, too, she thought.</p><p>Colm tilted her chin up. \u201cBrodick and I are both trying to find out where he is. I know it is difficult, but you must be patient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could still be at Wellingshire.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI have sent a messenger into England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have?\u201d</p><p>She was so surprised by his thoughtfulness, she didn\u2019t know what to say or think about him. Had she been wrong to judge him so harshly? Maybe he wasn\u2019t such an ogre after all.</p><p>Then she remembered Joan.</p><p>When Gabrielle\u2019s tear-filled eyes squinted into a frown, Colm was perplexed. Now what was wrong? He would never understand her. He had thought she would be happy to hear that he was trying to find her father. Aye, she should be damned pleased. She certainly shouldn\u2019t be looking like she wanted to strangle him.</p><p>Gabrielle decided that now wasn\u2019t the time to talk to him about Joan. She would need privacy for that discussion as well.</p><p>\u201cColm, do you remember I asked for a moment alone with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to need a lot more time.\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded to Lucien, then went to the table and poured himself a goblet of water. He noticed the arrows. \u201cWhat are those doing here?\u201d</p><p>Lucien answered. \u201cI wanted to show the differences between the two. Princess, if you don\u2019t mind, I will go help Faust now.\u201d Her loyal guard bowed to her and left the hall.</p><p>Colm picked up both arrows. \u201cWho do these belong to?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat color is the marking on the fletching?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He turned an arrow over in his hand examining it.</p><p>Thinking he didn\u2019t understand what she meant, she walked over to him, leaned into his side, and pointed to the color in the center of each feather. \u201cSaffron. See? Saffron is Lucien\u2019s color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he mark it?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cSo that he would know it belonged to him. When we practice, sometimes our arrows are so close together on the target, the only way to know who is dead center is by the color.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou use a bow?\u201d Colm asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I don\u2019t always practice with my guards, just sometimes. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019d like to go upstairs and find my needlework. I seem to have misplaced it.\u201d</p><p>She was halfway across the floor when Colm ordered her to stop.</p><p>\u201cWhat color does Faust mark his arrows with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristien?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Stephen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPurple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yours?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBlue. I mark mine blue.\u201d</p><p>Colm stood watching the stairs for a long minute after she had left. Then he went to the stone mantel and picked up the broken arrow he\u2019d pulled from the dead man at Finney\u2019s Flat.</p><p>The marking was blue.</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</p><p>C OLM HELD THE PROOF IN HIS HANDS, AND YET HE STILL couldn\u2019t believe it. Was it possible? Had Gabrielle been at Finney\u2019s Flat, and had she witnessed the atrocity?</p><p>His sweet and gentle Gabrielle had taken one of her arrows, notched it to her bow, and shot the bastard in the chest.</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t have done it. She didn\u2019t have the stomach for killing.</p><p>Yet the proof was in his hands.</p><p>\u201cColm, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Liam asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve been staring at that broken arrow for a good long while.\u201d</p><p>His mind racing, he didn\u2019t answer his brother. He remembered how Gabrielle had jumped to her feet to defend the priest when he\u2019d been prodded to tell them how Liam had gotten to the abbey.</p><p>She was there...and so were her guards. Had Stephen or one of the others used one of her arrows to make the kill? Aye, that\u2019s what must have happened. Gabrielle didn\u2019t have the mettle to take a life.</p><p>Colm called to Maurna, asking her to tell Gabrielle he wanted to speak to her. The housekeeper saw the look in her laird\u2019s eyes and hurried to do his bidding. Something had riled his temper, and she hoped to heaven Lady Gabrielle wasn\u2019t the cause. The genteel lady would be most upset if the laird raised his voice to her.</p><p>Maurna tapped on Gabrielle\u2019s door. \u201cThe laird\u2019s waiting to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>The housekeeper opened the door and peeked in. Gabrielle sat on the bed with her needlework in her lap.</p><p>\u201cMilady, I think there\u2019s some trouble brewing. The laird\u2019s unhappy about something. I wouldn\u2019t make him wait on you.\u201d</p><p>Maurna continued to whisper advice as she followed her mistress down the stairs. \u201cIf he shouts, don\u2019t you pay any mind. He won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he ever shouted at you, Maurna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he hasn\u2019t, but there\u2019s always the worry that he might. I\u2019d probably faint dead away.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle thought the housekeeper\u2019s concern for her was sweet. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t faint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven so, you might want to sit down while he tells you what\u2019s bothering him, just in case you get lightheaded. I don\u2019t want you bumping your head falling down. \u2019Course our laird is quick. He\u2019ll probably catch you.\u201d</p><p>Maurna didn\u2019t follow Gabrielle into the hall. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not about you, milady. Maybe he\u2019s displeased about something else.\u201d</p><p>Colm was talking to his brother when Gabrielle walked in. Liam stood and smiled at her, and she could see how tired he was. Getting back his strength was an arduous task. She then turned her attention to Colm. He wasn\u2019t smiling.</p><p>\u201cDid you wish to speak to me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cCome closer. I have something to show you.\u201d He held up the broken arrow. He expected an immediate reaction, but she looked only mildly curious. \u201cDo you recognize this, Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>She moved closer, saw the markings, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s one of my arrows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s broken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that it is,\u201d she agreed. \u201cWhere did you find it? I haven\u2019t hunted with my bow and arrows since I came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found it at Finney\u2019s Flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Finney\u2019s...\u201d Her eyes widened, and she took a step back. \u201cAt Finney\u2019s Flat, you say. How did it get there I wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought perhaps you could tell me. Would you like to know exactly where and when I found it?\u201d</p><p>She already knew. \u201cIt\u2019s broken, Colm. You might as well throw it away.\u201d</p><p>Liam leaned back against the table, desperately trying to follow the tense conversation.</p><p>\u201cWill one of you tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cThis is the arrow I pulled out of the dead man at Finney\u2019s Flat, Liam. He was on the ground by the hole the bastards had dug for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying...\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle glanced at Liam and said, \u201cIt\u2019s my arrow. That is what Colm is saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will now answer my questions without hesitation,\u201d Colm ordered. \u201cWere you at Finney\u2019s Flat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was there?\u201d Liam sounded like he was choking.</p><p>Impatience made her voice sharp. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Liam, try to keep up. Yes, I was there when you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one of your guards killed the bastard with your arrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of them did. I killed him.\u201d</p><p>Hearing a loud gasp, Gabrielle saw Maurna and Willa peeking out from the buttery.</p><p>She leaned around Colm and called out, \u201cThe man really did need killing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Willa\u2019s head was bobbing up and down, and Maurna\u2019s mouth was gaping open.</p><p>Colm threaded his fingers through his hair in agitation. \u201cAll this while I\u2019ve been trying to find out...why in God\u2019s name didn\u2019t you tell...\u201d He shook his head in a futile attempt to clear it and said, \u201cWere you ever going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been trying. I\u2019ve asked you over and over again for a moment of your time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a difference between sweetly asking me for time and telling me the matter was of the utmost importance.\u201d</p> <p>She poked him in his chest. \u201cHow was I to know which magical words I should use to get your attention?\u201d</p><p>She was aware that she sounded like a shrew. Maurna had worried how Gabrielle would react if the laird shouted at her, and now she was raising her voice to him.</p><p>Stephen took this most inopportune time to enter the hall. \u201cPrincess, is there a problem?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. Colm did. \u201cDamn right, there is.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle turned to Stephen. \u201cHe knows,\u201d she said on a sigh.</p> <p>\u201cAh.\u201d Her guard looked at Colm as he asked her, \u201cDid you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe figured it out. It was my arrow, Stephen. We forgot to remove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe arrow. Of course. I never thought about the markings. I cannot believe I was so careless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were busy carrying Liam from the field. Do not fault yourself. Colm was bound to find out eventually, and I had already decided it was time for me to tell him the truth.\u201d</p><p>Colm eyed both of them skeptically. \u201cAnd just why did you keep this a secret?\u201d</p><p>Stephen answered. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know who the men were or where they came from, and therefore we didn\u2019t know what the repercussions would be once the body was found.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were concerned about the ramifications because you killed the man?\u201d Colm asked Stephen.</p><p>\u201cNo, because I killed the man,\u201d Gabrielle answered.</p><p>\u201cIs this true?\u201d he asked Stephen.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. His pride was evident when he added, \u201cPrincess Gabrielle is more accurate with her bow than we are. There was no time to waste or consider consequences. The coward had raised his sword and fully intended to cut Liam in half. She stopped him.\u201d Nodding, Stephen said, \u201cIt was a clean, quick kill.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle watched Colm\u2019s face intently as he mulled over what they were telling him. What must he be thinking of her now? Since he\u2019d met her, she had gone from a whore to a cold-blooded killer. What lovely words to describe the woman he was to marry. She almost felt sorry for him.</p><p>Colm put his hands on Gabrielle\u2019s shoulders and forced her to stand in front of him. \u201cYou will explain everything that happened. And when you are finished, Stephen will give me his accounting.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle was relieved to finally get it all out in the open. She quickly recounted what she could remember, beginning with her goal to see Finney\u2019s Flat.</p><p>\u201cAs we approached the clearing, we heard voices, so we hid and didn\u2019t make ourselves known.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you see any faces?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at first. They wore robes with hoods. But a couple of them pulled the hoods back, and we did see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they were arguing with one another, and they used their given names, but we didn\u2019t hear any names of clans or families. The leader\u2019s name was Gordon. He\u2019s the man I killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were they arguing about?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle glanced sympathetically at Colm\u2019s brother before answering. \u201cThey wanted Liam to wake up so he would know he was being buried alive, and they argued over how they would put him in the grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they weren\u2019t going to bury him until they saw you on the ridge, Laird,\u201d Stephen interjected.</p><p>Colm clasped his hands behind his back and paced to the hearth. Deep in thought, he stared at the fire. \u201cDid they say why they needed to see me there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Laird,\u201d Stephen answered. \u201cLiam was the bait. They were using him to get to you.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</p><p>C OLM VOWED HE WOULD FIND THE BASTARDS. HE DIDN\u2019T care how long it took\u2014one year, ten, or a lifetime\u2014he would keep hunting until he had killed every last one of them. And before they died, they would tell him the name of the man who gave them their orders, for surely such a deliberate attack by strangers was masterminded by someone with something to gain. By all that was holy, there would be justice.</p><p>As it turned out, it didn\u2019t take a lifetime or even a year. Just one afternoon. And Colm didn\u2019t have to hunt them down. They came to him.</p><p>AFTER STEPHEN AND GABRIELLE had reported what they had heard at Finney\u2019s Flat, Liam paced back and forth venting his fury.</p><p>\u201cYou heard what Stephen said. They spoke our language, but their accent was different, more guttural. They must have come from the lowlands or the border. I say we call together all of our men and our allies and tear apart every inch of land from here to the border until we find them. Bury me alive? Cut me in half? Son of a whore!\u201d Liam\u2019s anger and his impatience for reprisal spilled out in every word.</p><p>Arms folded, Colm stood quietly in front of the hearth. He allowed his brother to voice his rage until Liam began describing how he thought each of his attackers should die.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle doesn\u2019t need to hear this, Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll suffer. I swear to God, they\u2019ll scream for mercy,\u201d he vowed. Spent now from his tirade, Liam dropped into a chair.</p><p>\u201cYou know we\u2019ll find them,\u201d Colm said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Liam answered. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>With tempers at last under control, the two brothers began to formulate plans.</p><p>Since Colm was occupied with Stephen and Liam, Gabrielle thought this might be the perfect time for her to slip away. Twice she had tried to leave the hall, and twice Colm had pulled her back. He finally anchored her to his side by putting his arm around her. She wasn\u2019t going anywhere until he allowed it.</p><p>Poor Father Gelroy strolled into the hall seeking his noon meal and was immediately stopped and questioned at length. The priest looked relieved that the truth was out at last, then looked appalled when he found out Gabrielle had taken a man\u2019s life.</p><p>Gabrielle felt worn thin, but she was also relieved that it was all finally out in the open. Telling Colm the truth had been exhausting work. She leaned against him and relaxed. The terrible burden had been lifted and given to him. She didn\u2019t doubt that he would find the men who hurt Liam and was thankful he had stopped his brother from describing the gruesome manner in which they would die.</p><p>When Colm let Stephen return to the field and Father Gelroy was allowed to go to the kitchens in search of food, Gabrielle was finally alone with him, but not for long.</p><p>He let go of her. \u201cGabrielle\u2014\u201d he began.</p><p>Maurna interrupted. \u201cBegging your pardon, Laird, but they\u2019re here. If you don\u2019t have time now, I could stand them in the corner and let them squirm until you\u2019re ready to punish them.\u201d</p><p>Following on Maurna\u2019s heels was another servant. \u201cThe winch is broken, and the men can\u2019t get the big stones up to the top. They\u2019re thinking you should look at it.\u201d</p><p>Colm nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in just a minute, Emmett.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle could have taken her leave then, but she stayed where she was and watched as Maurna half dragged, half pushed two little boys into the hall. Both had their heads down. Colm dismissed Maurna and ordered the boys to tell him what they had done.</p><p>He towered over them, and Gabrielle could only imagine what they must be thinking when they looked up at such a giant. Neither seemed afraid, though, as each tried to outtalk the other.</p><p>Colm raised his hand. \u201cOne at a time. Ethan, you will go first, and Tom, you will stop staring at Lady Gabrielle and pay attention to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Laird, but is she your lady?\u201d Tom asked.</p><p>\u201cYes she is, now be silent while I hear what Ethan has to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Laird, but are you going to marry with her?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>Colm showed remarkable patience. His expression was stern, but the boys felt comfortable with him or they wouldn\u2019t have asked so many questions.</p><p>Gabrielle thought they were the most adorable boys. They couldn\u2019t have been more than five years old, and though they weren\u2019t identical, it was apparent they were twins. Both had freckles and big brown eyes with a bit of the devil in them.</p><p>Three times Colm had to remind them why they were there, and finally Ethan told his story.</p><p>\u201cSee, Laird, what we did was...\u201d he began.</p><p>Those were the only words Gabrielle understood. Tom kept interrupting and correcting, and the story became so convoluted that by the time they finished, she didn\u2019t have the faintest idea what their transgression was.</p><p>Then Tom, a bit more precocious than Ethan, felt he should have a turn. His explanation was just as nonsensical.</p><p>The boys were in constant motion, rocking back and forth and side to side, elbowing each other and peeking at her.</p><p>Apparently Colm understood what they had told him. \u201cYou will not go into the kitchens unless you are invited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Laird, but could we go inside when we want to play with the cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you may not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Laird,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cBut could we maybe look inside sometimes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may go into the kitchen only when you are invited by Willa. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Laird,\u201d Tom said. \u201cBut could we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you could not. Now you will go to Willa and you will apologize to her.\u201d</p><p>The boys nodded their heads. \u201cYes, Laird,\u201d they recited in unison.</p><p>\u201cAnd then you will go to your aunt and apologize to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Laird, but we didn\u2019t spill her flour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will apologize for getting into mischief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Laird, but could we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Tom.\u201d His tone was deliberately harsher, and he got just the reaction he wanted. Their eyes widened, and they nodded again. Liam coughed to cover his laughter.</p><p>Colm said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear any arguments. I will decide what your punishment will be. Come back to me tomorrow, and I will tell you what you must do.\u201d</p><p>The boys ran toward the buttery and then made a detour to the table, where Liam was sitting.</p><p>\u201cLiam, are you better now?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I am better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we see your back?\u201d Tom asked. \u201cWhere you got hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Liam, but could we see\u2014\u201d</p><p>Liam smiled at the boys and tousled their hair. \u201cYou have done something very good today.\u201d</p><p>The boys beamed at the unexpected praise.</p><p>\u201cWe have?\u201d Ethan asked in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cYes, you have,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cWhat did we do?\u201d Tom wondered.</p><p>\u201cYou have shown me that there is still innocence in the world,\u201d Liam explained. \u201cNow leave before the laird decides what your punishment is.\u201d As soon as they were out of sight, he said, \u201cThey lighten my mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do not seem overly contrite,\u201d Gabrielle remarked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because they aren\u2019t,\u201d Colm answered.</p><p>\u201cWhat punishment will you give them?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m open to suggestions. So far they\u2019ve been banned from the stables, the fields, the hills beyond, the armory, and now the kitchens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is their father?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cGone.\u201d</p><p>She assumed that meant the man had died and didn\u2019t ask for further explanation.</p><p>\u201cBegging your indulgence, Laird, but about that winch...\u201d Emmett, who had been waiting patiently in the corner, said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d Colm answered.</p><p>Liam pushed himself up from the chair and walked over to Gabrielle. Colm was heading for the stairs, but stopped cold when Liam pulled Gabrielle into his arms and hugged her.</p><p>Gabrielle was so startled she stiffened for a few seconds.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Colm demanded.</p><p>\u201cShowing Lady Gabrielle my appreciation.\u201d</p><p>Colm felt a rush of possessiveness. No man had the right to touch what belonged to him, not even his brother.</p><p>\u201cLet go of her.\u201d</p><p>Liam ignored him. He kissed Gabrielle\u2019s forehead, leaned down close to her ear, and whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Just as Colm was about to rip Liam away from Gabrielle, his brother let go and walked out of the hall.</p><p>At first, Gabrielle was taken by surprise by Liam\u2019s sudden gesture, but as he left, she realized that showing his gratitude was actually a sweet, thoughtful thing to do. He had been quite gentle when he pulled her to him.</p><p>Colm was far from gentle when he grabbed her and wrapped his arms around her. He started to say something, then changed his mind and kissed her instead. His mouth took absolute possession in a kiss meant to melt any resistance she might have had.</p><p>Each kiss was more wonderful than the one before, but what happened after remained the same. Colm walked away without sparing her a backward glance, leaving her dazed. Gabrielle stared after him as he disappeared from view. She didn\u2019t think she was ever going to understand him.</p><p>With the weight of a heavy burden lifted from her shoulders and most of the afternoon still ahead of her, she decided to get some fresh air and walked to the stable to give Rogue a sweet treat. Then she went in search of Faust and Lucien. She found them sitting on a knoll behind the keep, working on their arrows. Lucien was using a rag to oil the shaft of an arrow while Faust attached the fletching to another arrow. She sat next to Faust and helped with the feathers. The two men spoke in their native tongue, and she listened while Faust told Lucien that Colm now knew that they\u2019d been at Finney\u2019s Flat. After a pleasant hour had passed, Gabrielle asked the two guards if they would ride with her outside the holding. Lucien wanted to keep working, so Faust saddled two horses for them.</p><p>Gabrielle could tell Rogue was eager to run. As soon as they were past the fortress wall, she turned north, gave him his head, and let him race to the top of the first hill, then she slowed his gait as she rode beside Faust into the open countryside.</p><p>\u201cShould we head back?\u201d Faust asked after a few minutes passed. \u201cThe caravan with your trunks should be here soon. I wonder if the abbot remembered to send the statue of St. Biel. Father Gelroy will want to put it in front of the chapel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe chapel that doesn\u2019t exist yet,\u201d she said. \u201cIt can stay in the storage room until one is built.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe someday your father will send the larger statue of our saint, the one that stood in the courtyard outside your mother\u2019s room. It was a gift from your grandfather before she left St. Biel.\u201d A fleeting look of sadness passed over his eyes when he added, \u201cThere should be snow in the mountains of St. Biel by now.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle could see that the guard was becoming nostalgic and perhaps a little homesick, and she felt a pang of guilt for pulling him even farther from his homeland.</p><p>\u201cYou will return soon, I think,\u201d she said.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThat is what Stephen says, but you must be married before we leave...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you must know that I will be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe already have faith that your laird won\u2019t let any harm come to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon then you will be complaining about the bitter cold and snow.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>They rode down the hills and continued on to the ridge overlooking Finney\u2019s Flat. Gabrielle knew the sentries wouldn\u2019t allow her to go farther. She slowed the pace to accommodate the curve in the trail. They rounded a hill to where the path straightened, and Gabrielle suddenly pulled hard on the reins. A procession was heading in their direction. Three narrow carts laden with trunks and bundles led by a half dozen men on horses were less than a stone\u2019s throw away.</p> <p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Before Faust could ask what was wrong, she jerked on the reins to turn Rogue around and goaded him into a gallop.</p><p>Faust raced to keep up. When they were almost back to the holding, he called to her, \u201cPrincess, what is wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose men...they\u2019re here. I cannot believe my eyes. Call the others. Hurry, Faust.\u201d</p><p>When they reached the stables, Gabrielle jumped down and handed Rogue\u2019s reins over to a stable boy. Had she had her wits about her, she would have ridden to the courtyard, but she ran instead. Questions raced through her head. She had to be sure. Were these the same men? And if they were, what were they doing at the MacHugh holding? This didn\u2019t make sense.</p><p>Gabrielle had to be certain before she condemned them. Faust hadn\u2019t recognized them because he had stayed with the horses in the forest, but the others had gone with her to the clearing at Finney\u2019s Flat. They had seen some of the men, but not as clearly as she had. If only she could hear them speak, then she could know for certain. She would recognize their voices.</p> <p>Faust called the other guards with two long piercing whistles. Stephen was instructing the young MacHugh warriors and had just notched an arrow to his bow when he heard the whistles. Without a word of explanation, he dropped the bow and arrow and ran.</p><p>Christien was just about to show a soldier how to use leverage against an opponent in hand-to-hand combat. When he heard the whistle, he tossed the young man to the ground and leaped over him on his way toward the sound.</p><p>Lucien and Faust were with Gabrielle by the time Stephen and Christien arrived. With her guards surrounding her, she told what she had seen.</p><p>Stephen agreed that she must be certain before she told the laird.</p><p>\u201cThey would be fools to come here,\u201d Lucien said.</p><p>\u201cThat is exactly what I was thinking,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut Princess, why would they be afraid to come here? They don\u2019t know we saw them,\u201d Christien pointed out.</p><p>\u201cDid any of you see their faces clearly?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see them. I stayed with the horses,\u201d Faust said.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see all of them,\u201d Stephen replied. \u201cI remember moving behind you so you could have a clear shot with your arrow. The hoods of their capes still covered them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I would remember what they looked like,\u201d Lucien admitted.</p><p>\u201cThe princess saw all of them, and she will remember,\u201d Christien said. \u201cTrust yourself,\u201d he told Gabrielle.</p><p>\u201cWhen I hear their voices, I will be certain.\u201d</p><p>The sound of the horses\u2019 hooves on the drawbridge drew their attention. The caravan had arrived. Sentries stopped them at the gate. Only the horses pulling the carts were allowed to cross, and the men riding their own mounts were ordered to leave them outside the walls and walk the rest of the way. The men on foot walked ahead of the carts and made their way up the incline toward Gabrielle and her guards. The closer they came, the faster Gabrielle\u2019s heart raced. When they were close enough for her to see their faces clearly, fear gripped her.</p><p>Unaware that they were walking to their doom, the men laughed and talked to one another. Gabrielle heard their voices, but she already knew: they were indeed the same men.</p><p>Stephen didn\u2019t take his eyes off them as he asked, \u201cPrincess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, now I\u2019m certain,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>The guards moved protectively closer to her.</p><p>\u201cFaust, go and find the laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat be her?\u201d one of the men asked.</p><p>\u201cThey told us she\u2019s got black hair and is fair to look at,\u201d another said. \u201cIf those men would move away from her, I could get a good look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t give over the trunks until we know for sure it\u2019s her.\u201d</p><p>One man dropped his voice to a whisper. \u201cLet\u2019s get this over with quick. I ain\u2019t stayin\u2019 around to meet the laird.\u201d</p><p>Colm had been working with the stonemasons on the winch at the side of the keep. He rounded the corner with a frayed rope in his hands just as Faust called to him.</p><p>The visitors formed a line in front of the first cart. The tallest stepped forward and with an air of importance announced, \u201cWe brung the Lady Gabrielle\u2019s trunks. We\u2019ll leave them if you will tell us if that woman be her.\u201d He pointed to Gabrielle.</p><p>No one answered him.</p><p>Colm walked over to Gabrielle. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked.</p><p>His nearness gave her strength, but she couldn\u2019t stop her hand from trembling when she touched his arm. \u201cI would like you to meet the men who have brought my things to me.\u201d She took a step forward, but Stephen stopped her from taking another. \u201cI am Lady Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>The spokesman eyed MacHugh nervously as he said to Gabrielle, \u201cThen these be your trunks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe brung them from the abbey.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle turned to Colm. \u201cThese men will be of interest to you.\u201d</p><p>Colm looked them over. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>With her back to the infidels, she whispered, \u201cThey like to dig holes.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</p><p>\u201cY OU\u2019RE CERTAIN OF THIS, GABRIELLE?\u201d COLM ASKED.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle couldn\u2019t tell what Colm was thinking. She whispered, \u201cDo you want me to give you their names? I remember all of them.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at her when he answered, \u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary. Go inside, Gabrielle, and stay there.\u201d</p><p>His control amazed her. She knew rage had to be surging through his veins, but he wasn\u2019t letting anything show.</p><p>Without being asked, Christien ran in search of Braeden, feeling the laird\u2019s commander should know what was going on.</p><p>As Lucien and Faust were escorting her inside, Gabrielle looked back over her shoulder. Colm walked toward the condemned men. With terror-stricken eyes, they retreated and scrambled around the carts, only to find dozens of armed MacHugh warriors coming up the hill behind them.</p><p>The door closed behind her, and she climbed the steps to the great hall. She didn\u2019t hear any sounds coming from outside\u2014it was deadly quiet\u2014and neither guard would allow her to look out the window. One hour passed, then another and another. And still not a sound from outside. Despite Lucien\u2019s and Faust\u2019s attempts to divert her attention, Gabrielle\u2019s apprehension grew.</p><p>As the sun was setting, Stephen came into the hall. He was alone.</p><p>\u201cPrincess, your trunks have been placed in the storage room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Tomorrow will be soon enough to go through them. Do you happen to know if Colm will be coming soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe laird has left the holding. I doubt he\u2019ll be back tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMilady, your supper\u2019s on the table waiting for you,\u201d Maurna announced.</p><p>\u201cI thought I would wait for the laird and his brother...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have both left the holding,\u201d Stephen said.</p><p>\u201cJust the two of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He would say nothing more.</p><p>Gabrielle learned more from Maurna than from any of her guards.</p><p>\u201cA fair number of our clansmen went with our laird. And the strangers who brought your things went with them, too. From the looks of things, I don\u2019t think they wanted to go, but you can\u2019t say no to the laird, can you?\u201d</p><p>It was apparent that Maurna didn\u2019t know who these strangers were or what they had done, and Gabrielle wasn\u2019t about to tell her.</p><p>She went to bed early that night, but sleep didn\u2019t come until the early-morning hours.</p><p>Colm didn\u2019t return to the keep for five long days and nights. And when at last he came, he didn\u2019t make a big announcement of his arrival. Gabrielle came down the stairs one morning and there he was, standing in front of the hearth. She was so surprised to see him, she nearly tripped on the last step. She nervously smoothed her gown and adjusted the braided belt resting on her hips. Had she known he was back, she would have taken more time and care with her appearance. She would have worn her emerald green gown, not this faded blue one, and she would have bound her hair up with a pretty ribbon. She wouldn\u2019t have let it hang down around her shoulders.</p><p>She knew she looked drab, but it was actually his fault, she decided, because he hadn\u2019t given her any warning.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re home,\u201d she said.</p><p>Colm turned and his fierce eyes hungrily took her in. Damn, but he had missed her. He missed her smiles, her frown, her laughter, and most of all he missed kissing her.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t much for honeyed words. \u201cYou sleep your mornings away, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot even say hello to me before you begin to criticize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not sleeping at night, Laird.\u201d Maurna made the announcement as she carried a pitcher to the table. She placed it next to four goblets, bowed to her laird, and added, \u201cSome nights she doesn\u2019t go upstairs until the wee hours of the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know when I go upstairs?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cGarrett told David, and he told Aitken, who told my man, who told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how would Garrett know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew because Nevin told him. Do you want to know how Nevin knew?\u201d</p><p>Dear God, no, she didn\u2019t. She had a feeling this litany could go on all morning.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, come here,\u201d Colm ordered.</p><p>She crossed the hall to stand in front of him. She leaned up on tiptoes and kissed him full on the mouth. It was quick, but still a kiss. She stepped back, looked up at him, and said, \u201cWelcome home, Laird.\u201d</p><p>And that, she believed, was a proper greeting. She folded her hands and waited for him to do the same.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you sleeping at night?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Ignoring the question, she asked, \u201cAre you happy to be home? And if you are, you should tell me so. It is the courteous thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I am happy to be home, you daft woman. Now answer my question.\u201d</p><p>Since he\u2019d been smiling at her when he called her daft, she didn\u2019t take offense.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you be worried about something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I be worrying? What could I have to worry about? Could it be that I fear for my father since I have no notion of where he might be? Or might it be that my future husband leaves and doesn\u2019t return for days on end? Could I be worried that something might have happened to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would worry about me?\u201d</p><p>She jabbed him in the chest. \u201cAnd you call me daft?\u201d She took a deep breath before continuing. \u201cYes, I was worried about you, but you were last on my list of worries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie, Gabrielle, and not at all well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t want to marry me,\u201d she began, \u201cbut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will marry you,\u201d a voice from the entrance called.</p><p>Liam strode into the hall.</p><p>\u201cNo, you will not marry me, Liam,\u201d she said in exasperation. \u201cAnd I am trying to have a private conversation with Colm. Please leave.\u201d</p><p>Colm put his arm around Gabrielle and pulled her close. \u201cLady Gabrielle has agreed to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I know she has, but you don\u2019t want her, and I do,\u201d said Liam. \u201cShe didn\u2019t save your life, she saved mine, and I am forever in her debt.\u201d</p><p>Colm was getting angry. \u201cDo you think I would give her up to you or to any other man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you do want her?\u201d Liam retorted.</p><p>\u201cDamn right, I do!\u201d</p><p>Liam nodded, and with the most satisfied grin he said, \u201cYou might want to tell her so.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle and Colm heard him laughing as he descended the stairs.</p><p>Colm turned her in his arms and looked into her eyes. \u201cI will never let you go, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say, which was probably just as well, because he didn\u2019t give her time to do more than open her mouth.</p><p>His mouth covered hers, and his tongue thrust inside, demanding a response. She wrapped her arms around his neck and moved restlessly against him as his mouth slanted over hers again and again. Their kiss became carnal. She aroused him as no other woman could, and Colm knew if he didn\u2019t stop now, he would lose all control.</p><p>When he ended the kiss, Gabrielle\u2019s heart was pounding. She could barely catch her breath. She was jerked from her daze by a man\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cLaird, begging your pardon, but there are more problems with the winch.\u201d</p><p>The stonemason was standing directly behind her. Colm waved the man away.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, I noticed you haven\u2019t asked me what happened when I left here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you tell me if I asked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it is good that I don\u2019t ask. I don\u2019t think I want to hear what happened to those men. I might have nightmares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRest easy,\u201d he said. \u201cI did not have them buried alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is exactly what I was worried about. You know my thoughts as well as I do. Liam was so distraught, and he threatened to do such terrible things.\u201d She sighed. \u201cBut you did not bury them alive.\u201d She tilted her head and studied his face for several seconds then dared to ask, \u201cWhat did happen to them? Did you let them return home?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She knew not to prod him, fearing he would tell her exactly what the punishment had been. Colm wasn\u2019t the forgiving sort, nor was Liam.</p><p>\u201cWere you able to find out who sent them after Liam?\u201d</p><p>Before he could answer, two more clansmen came into the hall, begging his attention. Colm ignored them, but Gabrielle couldn\u2019t. \u201cYour clan makes many demands on your time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d best go.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cYes, I\u2019d best go.\u201d He grabbed her hand as he walked past her and pulled her along. \u201cSaddle my horse,\u201d he ordered one of the men waiting. To another, he said, \u201cI will not listen to any problems until this afternoon. Make that clear to those waiting.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle stepped out of the way to let a clansman carrying a bag of grain over his shoulder enter the open door of the storage room.</p><p>He nodded his greeting to her and turned to Colm. \u201cWould you like me to help carry Lady Gabrielle\u2019s clothes upstairs?\u201d</p> <p>Colm looked into the room and saw the trunks stacked on the floor. \u201cYou carry far too many possessions,\u201d he criticized.</p><p>Gabrielle laughed. \u201cDoes everyone think these trunks are filled with gowns?\u201d</p><p>The young man nodded. \u201cThe English have need for more than we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the MacHughs have need to make judgments without knowing the facts,\u201d she countered. \u201cIf you have a moment, I would like you to open one of my trunks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what purpose?\u201d Colm asked.</p><p>\u201cOpen one and see for yourself.\u201d</p> <p>She had captured his curiosity. \u201cWhich one would you like me to open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou choose.\u201d</p><p>Colm pulled one trunk down from the stack and was surprised by the weight.</p><p>\u201cDanen, grab one end,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cEnglish clothes weigh more than a trunk filled with stone,\u201d Danen grunted.</p><p>\u201cClothes don\u2019t weigh this much, even English clothes.\u201d</p><p>There were four latches. Colm unlocked each one, then lifted the lid. Bags stuffed full were packed inside.</p><p>Gabrielle suggested he use his dagger to pierce the cloth, and when he did, grains of salt spilled out.</p> <p>He was astounded. \u201cYou bring salt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Salt was one of my gifts to Laird Monroe, and now it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalt is more valuable than the most precious jewels,\u201d Danen stammered. His green eyes were bright with excitement. \u201cAnd much needed. Isn\u2019t that true, Laird?\u201d</p><p>Colm agreed with a nod. \u201cAre all these trunks filled with salt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll but one. You are pleased?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. If anyone had known what was inside these trunks, they never would have gotten here.\u201d</p><p>He latched the locks and walked outside. A stable boy led Colm\u2019s horse across the courtyard. The skittish animal had tried to rear up twice before Colm calmed him. The Black, as he was called, was a magnificent animal. He was twice the size of Rogue, but Gabrielle doubted his disposition was half as sweet. Colm lifted her onto The Black, then swung up behind her and took the reins.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>A woman carrying a basket hurried toward them. \u201cLaird, if you have a minute, I need but a word about\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will have to wait.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arm around Gabrielle\u2019s waist and held her tight against him as he nudged the giant horse forward. Gabrielle couldn\u2019t imagine what had come over Colm. He wasn\u2019t running from her to take care of the demands of his clan. Nay, he seemed now to be running from his clan to be with her.</p><p>Once they\u2019d cleared the moat, Colm gave The Black a kick and raced into the wind. They didn\u2019t stop until they reached a crest overlooking a beautiful glen with a brook meandering through it. He dismounted and lifted her to the ground. His hands lingered on her waist before he moved away.</p><p>\u201cCome sit with me. We need to talk,\u201d Colm said.</p><p>His tone worried her. \u201cIs it bad news you have? Is that why you wanted me alone, so I wouldn\u2019t disgrace you by weeping in front of your clan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could not disgrace me.\u201d</p><p>She sat down by a tree and adjusted her skirts to cover her ankles. \u201cI have learned to expect the worst.\u201d</p><p>He knelt on one knee in front of her and cupped her chin in the palm of his hand.</p><p>\u201cI brought you here so that we would not be interrupted, which, as you surely have noticed, happens quite frequently in my holding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt happens because you don\u2019t delegate. You should, you know. If you would give Braeden and the others, including your brother, more responsibility, you not only would take some of the burden off your shoulders, but you also would show them you have trust in them. You aren\u2019t the only one who can make a good decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not bring you here to have you lecture me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you will consider what I have said?\u201d</p><p>He sat down next to her and leaned back against the tree. \u201cI will,\u201d he said, stretching his long legs out in front of him, then crossing one foot over the other.</p><p>He looked relaxed, she thought, but then so did lions before they pounced.</p><p>\u201cIf it were good news, you would have told me by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s neither good nor bad. Here is what I know. The men who brought your trunks would never have come to my home if they had known anyone had seen them at Finney\u2019s Flat. I had the opportunity to question them at length.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t ask him to explain what he meant by opportunity. \u201cAnd they answered your questions?\u201d</p><p>Did she possibly think he had given them a choice? Of course they had answered his questions. He made it all but impossible for them to refuse.</p><p>\u201cThey all insisted that they never knew the name of the man who hired them. Only their leader knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGordon. He was their leader, and I killed him.\u201d She patted his knee as though to console him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry you won\u2019t ever find out who sent them after Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMacKenna sent them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will explain, and you will hold your questions until I\u2019m finished.\u201d He waited for her nod and then said, \u201cBaron Coswold had your trunks taken to the abbey. Almost immediately after you left the abbey, he and his soldiers began their search for you. So did the other one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPercy?\u201d Even his name repelled her, and she shivered with disdain. \u201cThe two of them are demons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I understand, they have both been chasing rumors, trying to find you. Coswold heard that you might be living with my clan, and he needed to find out for certain before he acted. What better way than to send your trunks with men who would report back to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe abbot didn\u2019t send them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt Coswold\u2019s urging, he did. But I\u2019m sure the abbot thought he was doing a kindness. The problem was finding men to take them. Coswold couldn\u2019t send Englishmen. They never would have gotten this far, and if by chance and luck they did, they would never have made it back to report to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how did he...\u201d She realized she was once again interrupting and stopped.</p><p>\u201cThe men Gordon hired didn\u2019t know MacKenna was paying them, but MacKenna knew who they were. Gordon gave him their names.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get this information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing what a man will remember when pressured to do so. The one named Hamish told me he heard Coswold and MacKenna had come to some sort of an arrangement. He called it a pact. Coswold knew King John wouldn\u2019t give you to him, and so he promised you to MacKenna. He would get Finney\u2019s Flat, and in return Coswold would be able to see you whenever he wanted. It\u2019s my understanding they intended to share you.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle felt ill. \u201cI did not think these men could sicken me any more than they already have, but now you tell me they meant to share me? As they would a wife? Oh, my God...\u201d</p><p>She tried to get up, but Colm gently pulled her down beside him. \u201cAnother one of the outcasts admitted he overheard Coswold whispering to one of his confidants. Yes, Coswold wanted you in his bed, Gabrielle, but he also wanted information he believes you hide.\u201d</p><p>Colm thought it peculiar that Gabrielle didn\u2019t ask him if he had any idea what kind of information Coswold thought she might have.</p><p>\u201cYou know what he wants, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGabrielle?\u201d</p><p>She rested against his side. \u201cHe wants the treasure of St. Biel.\u201d</p><p>She told him the legend as it had been told to her countless times.</p><p>\u201cIt is said that St. Biel\u2019s King Grenier did not send all the gold to the pope, but hid it away. It is also believed that the treasure is so vast, whoever finds it will have the power to rule the world. No one has ever found it, but it makes an interesting story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why does Coswold believe it exists?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why does he think you know where the treasure is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are some who believe that the secret was passed down from the king to his daughter, and she in turn passed it down to her daughter...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your mother ever talk about this treasure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me all the stories. She thought that greed is why some believe this legendary treasure exists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the people of St. Biel?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo they believe the myth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome do, others don\u2019t. They have few needs. They have enough food to eat with fishing and hunting, and enough wood to heat their homes. They live a simple but rich life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, they wouldn\u2019t want the gold.\u201d</p><p>He had wrapped his arm around her waist, and she stroked it with her fingertips while she thought about her mother\u2019s homeland. Her touch was as light as a feather, but had a powerful effect on him.</p><p>\u201cNow it is my turn to ask you questions, Colm. You said that Coswold needed to be certain I was living with your clan before he acted. What does that mean? What do you think he intends to do?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI have yet to find out what is in his twisted mind, but I will, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the name of King John, he banished me, remember? And Percy was united with Coswold in condemning me. Yet you say, as soon as they left the abbey, they began to search for me?\u201d Her fingers traced the scar on his hand. \u201cHow did you know I was innocent? You said you knew that Isla had lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe moon. She said the moon was bright and that she was able to see you, but it rained that night, Gabrielle. There was no moon. I know because I was searching for Liam, and it was too dark to continue. I had to wait until morning light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the monk lied. I believe he saw me when I went to look in on Liam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is what I think as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you betrothed to another woman?\u201d She blurted the question before she lost her courage. \u201cLady Joan? Did you promise to marry her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was going to marry her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer father decided another alliance would make him stronger, so she was married to Laird Dunbar. Like Monroe, he was an older man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s coming here, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had not heard this, but she will be welcomed. Her sister is married to one of my men.\u201d</p><p>The question she most wanted him to answer she couldn\u2019t ask. Did he love Joan? And if Gabrielle asked, would he tell her the truth?</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do about MacKenna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you will go to war against the MacKenna clan?\u201d she asked, and before he could answer, she added, \u201cWhat if Coswold adds his army to MacKenna\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not worry about Coswold or Percy,\u201d he replied. \u201cThey have no power over you.\u201d</p><p>If that were true, why then was she so afraid?</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY</p><p>K ing John was demanding an accounting, and Baron Coswold was fit to be tied. He had been ordered to meet with John at Newell\u2019s castle, where the king was taking his leisure after a failed campaign against the Welsh. A large number of John\u2019s barons were so incensed by their king\u2019s attacks that they threatened to rise up against him. Coswold expected John to be in one of his black moods.</p><p>Percy had also been summoned to Newell\u2019s castle to give his version of what had taken place at Arbane Abbey, and Coswold could only imagine the lies his enemy would tell.</p><p>Coswold allowed Isla to accompany him. He had grown accustomed to talking to her about his worries without concern that she would repeat anything he said. Her station in life was solely dependent upon his good graces, and she would do nothing to jeopardize it.</p><p>She took good care of him. She saw to his every comfort and made certain the servants ran his home to his liking. Coswold never walked into a chilled room or picked up an empty goblet. She knew what foods he liked and what foods he avoided. Coswold also knew that eventually he would have to take a wife so that he would have heirs, but even then he planned to keep Isla around to continue to do his bidding.</p><p>She had become even more solicitous since he\u2019d allowed her to go with him to Arbane Abbey, and now she could barely hide her excitement. He knew why. She had heard that Percy would be there with the king. Oh, what a fool she was to think she would ever have a future with Coswold\u2019s enemy. Back at Arbane Abbey when Isla had accused Gabrielle of whorish behavior, at first Coswold was annoyed at the spectacle, but then he realized it might be used to his advantage.</p><p>\u201cAre you eager to see Baron Percy again?\u201d he asked her on the trip to Newell\u2019s castle.</p><p>\u201cIt is true that I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsla, he doesn\u2019t even speak to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does,\u201d she insisted. \u201cUpon occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou waste your time longing for him.\u201d</p><p>She hid her smile. \u201cThere is talk that he will soon be married.\u201d</p><p>Coswold shrugged indifference. \u201cThen he must have given up on Lady Gabrielle. It\u2019s about time. He could never have her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he wants another now,\u201d she said.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cHow would you know this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGossip,\u201d she said hastily. \u201cHave you heard from the men you told me you sent on an errand? You seemed to be worried when they didn\u2019t return immediately.\u201d</p><p>Coswold had told Isla he had hired men to take care of a matter for him, but he hadn\u2019t told her what the errand was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, I have not heard a word. It has been long enough for them to return to me. It is as though they, like my underling, Malcolm, have vanished into thin air.\u201d</p><p>Isla knew Malcolm was afraid of Coswold. She had seen the big, ugly man at Coswold\u2019s side and knew that he would kill if that was what her uncle ordered. Isla had heard that Malcolm had struck Lady Gabrielle with his fist. She was only sorry Malcolm hadn\u2019t disfigured Gabrielle. Isla hadn\u2019t any guilt over the pain her lie had caused.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you last see Malcolm?\u201d she asked, trying to sound concerned.</p><p>\u201cWe were searching the hills to the west of the abbey. One minute he was riding beside me, and the next time I looked, he was gone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat were you searching for, Uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever you mind. Ah, we have finally arrived. You will be as quiet as a mouse if you are in the presence of King John. It is already going on sunset. I doubt I will have my audience with him until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Coswold was very much mistaken. The king wanted to speak to the baron the minute he arrived. Coswold was not even allowed time to wash the dust from his hands.</p><p>Isla followed her uncle to the main hall, but stood just inside the door. She stood so close to the curtains that, had she wanted to, she could have hidden herself behind them without even being noticed.</p><p>The hall was three times the size of Coswold\u2019s hall. It boasted two fireplaces, one on each end. The king sat behind a long table covered by a white cloth that was so long the hem touched the floor.</p> <p>His Highness wore scarlet robes, identical to the color of the wine he spilled on the white cloth when he slammed the goblet down and stood.</p><p>John was not a handsome man. He was of average size with a protruding stomach, but to Isla he appeared a towering giant. She believed him to be as powerful as God, for he could destroy an entire country with one command. John had already proven to the world that he did not fear the pope. In fact, he profited from his own excommunication by confiscating church revenues. It was said that King John could steal the purity from a saint.</p><p>The dais John stood on made him appear much taller than Coswold, who bowed and then knelt before him. John had just given the baron permission to stand when the doors opened and Baron Percy strutted in. A woman about Isla\u2019s age followed. Dressed in fine clothing, she wore sparkling jewels around her neck and in her hair. She did not look to be related to Percy, but then Isla didn\u2019t look anything like her uncle. Perhaps the woman was a cousin or even, like Isla, a niece.</p><p>The woman was far too arrogant, though. She didn\u2019t hide in the shadows but knelt next to Percy and waited until John motioned both of them to stand.</p><p>John spoke to Percy first. \u201cI see you have come to your senses and heeded my command,\u201d he said, nodding at the woman standing next to the baron.</p><p>\u201cLady Beatrice, go and make yourself comfortable in your chambers.\u201d Percy clapped his hands, and two servants immediately appeared to show the lady the way.</p> <p>Once the elegant woman was out of sight, John discarded his manners. \u201cDo you know the trouble you have caused me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did what you would have wanted me to do,\u201d Percy said.</p><p>\u201cGive me your accounting now,\u201d the king commanded, \u201cand I will decide if what you did was right or wrong.\u201d</p><p>Percy quickly recounted what had happened at the abbey. \u201cNo one was more surprised than I to learn that Lady Gabrielle had acted as a common whore. I knew that you would want to punish her, and I wanted to bring her to you so that you could decide her fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow it is your turn, Coswold.\u201d</p><p>The baron explained what had happened after Monroe\u2019s murder was discovered, and when he was finished reciting his version of the events, he said, \u201cI did not think you would want to waste your time with a whore. I knew what must be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what was that, pray tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI banished her. In your name, I took everything away from her. She no longer has a king or a country or a family to call her own. She has been cast out into the wilds. I believe her punishment to be worse than a quick execution. Wouldn\u2019t you agree, my lord?\u201d</p> <p>John rubbed his chin. \u201cI do agree,\u201d he said at last. \u201cI find it difficult to believe that Baron Geoffrey\u2019s beautiful daughter would ruin herself. I will lay siege to Wellingshire and kill her father, for he did not do his duty and protect her innocence. She has no value to me now.\u201d</p><p>He picked up his goblet and took a long swallow. Wine dripped into his beard, and he used the back of his arm to wipe his chin.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you, too, Coswold, are now over your infatuation with Gabrielle? Percy has moved on, and I suggest you do the same.\u201d</p><p>Coswold turned to Percy. \u201cWhat do you have to smirk about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am to marry Lady Beatrice in two months\u2019 time. She brings a handsome dowry to our wedding. Most handsome.\u201d</p><p>Isla covered her mouth to stop herself from screaming. No, it couldn\u2019t be true. Percy was to marry her. He had promised.</p><p>When Coswold left the hall with King John, Isla didn\u2019t follow. Frozen in the shadows, she stared at Percy, who had remained behind.</p><p>Percy had seen Isla cowering by the window and decided to get his talk with her over and done with now. He needed to make certain she wouldn\u2019t cause him any problems. And if he must threaten her, he would. He walked to the dais, reached up, and poured himself a goblet of the king\u2019s wine. He didn\u2019t bother to turn around when he said, \u201cIsla, come out of the shadows so that we may talk.\u201d</p><p>Her legs were stiff as sticks as she crossed the hall. \u201cWho is Lady Beatrice?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe is my future wife. You heard the conversation. I will be married to her soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t love her. You love me. You said you did, and you promised to marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLower your voice,\u201d he snapped. He could see she was losing control. \u201cDo you want King John to hear you? You could be locked away in prison for the rest of your miserable days because of what you have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I have done?\u201d she screamed.</p><p>He slapped her across the face. \u201cI told you to be quiet! And you know good and well what you did. You destroyed Lady Gabrielle\u2019s life with your lies. You were her accuser.\u201d</p><p>Isla covered her cheek with her hand, though she was numb to the pain. \u201cYou told me what to say, and you promised that if I did exactly what you instructed me to do, you would then marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never marry you. You repulse me, Isla. You are Coswold\u2019s niece.\u201d</p><p>She began to sob. \u201cBut you promised...\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his sleeve, but he pushed her back. \u201cGet away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut no one will ever know the truth now, will they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why did you have me do it? Why did you want to destroy Lady Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew I couldn\u2019t have her, and I wanted to make sure Coswold couldn\u2019t have her, either. Then do you know what I planned to do? I was going to find her and take her to my home. I\u2019d use her every night. Picture it, Isla. I would touch her, caress her, worship her...\u201d</p><p>She tried to hit him, but he laughed as he fended off her attack.</p><p>\u201cWhat a pathetic creature you are...and so gullible. I knew Coswold would come up with a surprise, and he didn\u2019t disappoint me. He arrived with a brand-new writ signed by the king. But I was prepared. I had you. Aye, you were my little surprise if all else failed. And you came forth at my signal just as I had instructed you. If I couldn\u2019t have Gabrielle in marriage, I would get her another way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell everyone what you did,\u201d she threatened. Her devastation had turned to rage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean what you did? If you tell anyone you destroyed Lady Gabrielle with your lies, you will be condemned.</p><p>\u201cI told you that I might need you to lie so that I could get Finney\u2019s Flat and barter it away for gold, and you and I could live a rich, happy life together. How stupid you are. Did you not think that King John would take the land back? Ah, I can see from your eyes that you had not thought it. But then I didn\u2019t expect you would. You were fool enough to think I could love you. Why not believe everything else I told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want Gabrielle so much, why are you marrying this Beatrice woman?\u201d Isla sobbed.</p><p>\u201cShe has wealth,\u201d Percy admitted. \u201cShe will be very useful to me. And someday I\u2019ll resume my search for Gabrielle. I don\u2019t give up easily. Your uncle should know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell King John that you made me lie.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cHe won\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you so certain I won\u2019t believe her, Percy?\u201d</p><p>The baron dropped his goblet, so shocked was he to see His Highness standing in the doorway. \u201cYou misunderstand our conversation,\u201d Percy stammered. \u201cWhat did you hear, and I will explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence!\u201d the king shouted.</p><p>He motioned to two guards. \u201cMake certain Baron Percy stays quiet while I speak to this woman.\u201d</p><p>Isla was terrified, but her fury at Percy overrode her desire to save herself. Her head was bowed, but out of the corner of her eye she watched the king as he climbed three steps and sat in his royal chair.</p><p>\u201cGet to your knees in front of me and tell me about this lie,\u201d he ordered her.</p><p>She threw herself to the floor and confessed everything, begging for mercy at the end. John was seething. He called Coswold back into the hall and made Isla repeat her story. Isla couldn\u2019t look at her uncle, so great was her shame and her fear.</p><p>\u201cGet her out of my sight,\u201d the king ordered, and as his soldiers were storming toward her, Isla cried out, \u201cHave mercy, please. What is to become of me? Where will I go?\u201d</p><p>John motioned to the guards to wait. He eyed Isla coldly. \u201cDid you ever worry what would happen to Lady Gabrielle? Did you wonder where she would go?\u201d</p><p>Isla pointed to Percy. \u201cHe made me lie.\u201d</p><p>She was dragged out of the hall, screaming and crying. When the door closed behind her, John considered his barons.</p><p>Neither Coswold nor Percy said a word. They waited to hear what their king would decide. Coswold worried the king would blame him for Isla\u2019s conduct, and Percy worried his lands would be confiscated.</p><p>\u201cSurely both of you are aware of the trouble I face these days. The nobles have been released from their oaths to me because of my excommunication. There is unrest and talk of conspiracy. I must be on guard day and night. Now one of my most powerful barons, Geoffrey of Wellingshire, will plot against me because of you, Coswold, in my name banished his daughter. At this moment Geoffrey surely is gathering his forces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill him and be done with the worry,\u201d Percy suggested.</p><p>\u201cYou fool. Geoffrey has many influential friends who will be as outraged as he is. They will join him in fighting me. Would you have me kill them all? And will you and Coswold pay their tax to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know we cannot,\u201d Percy said.</p><p>\u201cI have enemies who aid Phillip of France. He would have my crown. I don\u2019t need more problems. Where is Lady Gabrielle now? Is she still alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe she is living with a clan high up north. They are a primitive group.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know if any man has claimed her for his own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but what would it matter? You could force her to come back to England,\u201d Coswold said.</p><p>John shook his head. \u201cYou have taken my power over her away, you fool. When you announced that she has no country, you also announced that she does not answer to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could still force her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuiet.\u201d</p><p>John considered the problem for several minutes before coming to a decision. \u201cI must first make peace with Baron Geoffrey before he gathers allies against me. I will send word to him that I have found out the truth about his innocent daughter. Gabrielle will be given Finney\u2019s Flat. If she isn\u2019t married, I will find a suitable husband for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if she is?\u201d Coswold asked.</p><p>\u201cThen Finney\u2019s Flat will be my wedding gift to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaird MacKenna would take her for his wife now that she has been proven innocent,\u201d Coswold said.</p><p>The king stood. \u201cI believe you did not have a part in this treachery of lies, Coswold. You will continue to be my humble servant. As for Percy, I think you should have time to consider your transgressions. He motioned to his guards. \u201cTake him away.\u201d</p><p>As Percy was being escorted out of the hall, Coswold stepped in front of him. Percy glowered at his enemy.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>Coswold smirked. \u201cI think it is.\u201d In a whisper, he added, \u201cAnd I win.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-ONE</p><p>C OLM WAS HEADING OUTSIDE TO GIVE ORDERS TO HIS men as Gabrielle was coming down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she called out. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a fine day today, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He stopped and waited for her to reach him. She was a bonny sight to be sure. Her gown was a royal blue, and though he would have preferred her to wear his colors, she still looked beautiful. Had they already been married, he knew exactly what he would do at this very moment. He would pick her up, carry her back to his bed, and take his time removing her clothes.</p><p>There was no way he was going to make it five more months without bedding her, and he decided that as soon as he returned home, he would order the priest to bless their union. When Colm first took her in, Brodick had suggested that Colm delay the marriage, warning that if Gabrielle got pregnant immediately after the wedding, some might believe the babe was from another man. Colm had another solution. He would know the babe was his and kill any man who suggested otherwise.</p><p>He thought about telling her now that he would marry her as soon as he returned, then changed his mind. He\u2019d explain while the priest prepared for the ceremony.</p><p>\u201cLiam is in charge while I am away, and if you have any problems, go to him. He will know what to do,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cMay I ask where you are going?\u201d Gabrielle said.</p><p>The question puzzled him. He had already made his intentions clear to her. Had she forgotten so soon?</p><p>\u201cTo war, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>She nearly fell over. \u201cNow? You\u2019re going to war now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you act so surprised? I told you what I was going to do.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his arm and held tight so that he wouldn\u2019t get away from her until he had properly explained. \u201cYou said you were going to kill MacKenna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so you do remember. Now let go of me so that I may\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just go to war, Colm.\u201d Gabrielle couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing. Had he gotten up this morning, eaten his breakfast, called his men to arms, and now thought he would ride into battle? \u201cYou are not prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow am I not prepared?\u201d</p><p>Had he never gone to war before? Was that why he didn\u2019t know what he was supposed to do?</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t declared war first,\u201d she instructed. \u201cThen you must spend weeks, if not months, on preparation. There are weapons to be made and packed in a wagon, food to pack as well to sustain your men during battle, and all other necessary equipment must be carefully placed in wagons and taken along for your comforts.\u201d</p> <p>He contained his laughter and asked, \u201cExplain these necessary comforts to me.\u201d</p><p>She thought about what the nobles took with them when they went to war. \u201cYou will need a strong tent so that you will be sheltered from the rain, and a rug to place inside the tent so that you will not have to step barefoot on the hard ground when you get out of your bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do I take my bed with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about wine? How many barrels should I take with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs many as you think you will need,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are rules, Colm, even for you to follow. In a civilized war\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWar is never civilized, and you have just described to me how the English prepare for war. By now you should have noticed that I am not English.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still must prepare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my sword, my bow, and a sound horse. I have no need for more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will pray that you finish your war before you get hungry or thirsty.\u201d</p><p>She tried to walk away, but he grabbed her and kissed her soundly.</p> <p>\u201cWill you come back to me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>And then he was gone.</p><p>COLM AND HIS SOLDIERS had been gone from the holding for four days and nights when Lady Joan Dunbar arrived to pay her sister a visit.</p><p>Gabrielle was most curious to meet the woman Colm had intended to marry. She made up her mind that, no matter how pretty Joan was or how sweet her disposition, she would not be jealous of her. Colm obviously cared about the woman, or he wouldn\u2019t have agreed to marry her. He might even have loved her. But Gabrielle would not be jealous.</p><p>Colm didn\u2019t love Gabrielle. He had simply been trapped by a stupid debt. He never would have given her a second glance otherwise.</p><p>Did Joan love Colm? How could she not? He was a handsome, virile, strong man\u2014a protector. And if Joan loved him, so what? Gabrielle still wouldn\u2019t be jealous.</p><p>Perhaps she and Joan could even become friends. It would be nice to have a woman with whom to talk of matters that men would have no interest in. And she and Joan did have one thing in common: Colm. Yes, they just might become friends.</p> <p>But that was not to happen. After spending five minutes with the woman, Gabrielle knew they would never be friends. The reason was simple: Lady Joan was a bitch, and a mean one at that.</p><p>Fiona introduced her sister. Joan was much taller and thinner than Gabrielle. She didn\u2019t seem to have many curves. She was more statuesque. Her hair was so long it touched her waist, and the color was as pale as her complexion. Long lashes fanned across her azure eyes. She was pretty, and she knew it.</p><p>Joan kept sweeping her hair over her shoulder with the back of her hand in a dramatic gesture meant to draw attention to her curls.</p><p>\u201cThis is Lady Gabrielle, Joan,\u201d Fiona said. \u201cI explained to her that you and Laird MacHugh were to marry and then Father formed an alliance with Laird Dunbar and forced you to marry him.\u201d</p><p>Joan stared at Gabrielle as she asked her sister, \u201cDid you also explain that my husband is dead, and I am now free to marry Colm? And did you explain that I fully intend to do so?\u201d</p><p>Lady Joan didn\u2019t get quite the reaction she expected. Gabrielle was so surprised by what she\u2019d said, she burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cStop laughing,\u201d Joan demanded. \u201cI haven\u2019t said anything amusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would offer you my condolences on the loss of your husband, but you seem to have gotten past mourning him.\u201d</p><p>Joan wagged a finger at Gabrielle. \u201cI\u2019ve heard all about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s odd that I haven\u2019t heard anything about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s because I\u2019m not a whore.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle shrugged, and that action further incited Joan\u2019s anger.</p><p>\u201cColm won\u2019t marry a whore, and that\u2019s what you are.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle knew that Joan wanted her to defend herself, but she wasn\u2019t going to accommodate her. \u201cEnjoy your visit,\u201d she said and then walked away.</p><p>That night, as Gabrielle was pulling the covers back, she thought about Joan and what she had said.</p><p>One day, after she was married to Colm, she would tell him she had saved him from a fate worse than death. Aye, she\u2019d saved him from Joan.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO</p><p>T HE WAR WASN\u2019T CIVILIZED. IT WAS BLOODY AND HARD-FOUGHT.</p><p>MacHugh made no pretense of a surprise attack. He had made sure that MacKenna knew he was coming by sending word to surrounding clans that he was ready to avenge his brother.</p><p>When the news reached the MacKenna holding, the laird rallied his soldiers to battle, but he hadn\u2019t had time to call his allies. He swore that the MacHughs would never step foot on MacKenna land. MacKenna would meet the enemy head-on and make the first strike.</p><p>MacKenna never varied his strategy, believing what had worked in the past would work again. He would strike and retreat, again and again, with wave after wave of assaults. Although his men weren\u2019t as well-trained, they were twice in number, and he could move fresh troops in after each wave. He had another advantage as well: his archers. As the MacHughs poured down the mountain and crossed the flats, there would be no place to hide. Even if they managed to reach the border of the flats, his archers would be waiting to finish them off.</p><p>Colm counted on MacKenna\u2019s stupidity.</p><p>It never occurred to Laird MacKenna that the MacHughs could cross the flats in the dark. Even fools would never try to ride across what they could not see. Without light, their horses could stumble and falter. But the MacHughs didn\u2019t ride their horses, they silently led them across. By morning light they had made a wide circle and were in position behind their enemy. They advanced, forcing the MacKennas to engage in battle or run. Most of them ran.</p><p>Once they flushed the MacKennas into the open, they fought with their swords and with their fists. The battle was quickly won, for the MacKennas fought like the cowards they were. One even tried to use another as a shield against MacHugh\u2019s sword. Colm killed them both with one hard thrust, his blade cutting through two bodies just below their hearts.</p><p>Colm was always the first to go into battle. He led his men. MacKenna was always the last, fighting only when there was little actual danger of getting killed.</p><p>Bodies covered the field like rushes. Every dead MacKenna was turned over in search of the laird. But he was not to be found. Colm stood in the middle of the carnage, his sword dripping MacKenna blood, enraged that MacKenna had slipped away.</p><p>\u201cFind him!\u201d he roared.</p><p>The MacKenna keep was blocked off. The hunt continued.</p><p>Colm found his enemy three long days later, hiding like a coward in a grotto near the bluff overlooking Loch Gornoch. With swords drawn, two of MacKenna\u2019s soldiers stood guard in front of their laird.</p><p>Braeden leaped from his horse and ran to Colm\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cStand back,\u201d Colm ordered. His eyes locked on MacKenna as the two MacKenna soldiers ran for their lives.</p><p>Grasping his sword in both hands, Colm raised his arms high over his head.</p><p>The last image Owen MacKenna saw was a looming shadow.</p><p>The last sound he heard was the music of the sword.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</p><p>G ABRIELLE STOOD AT THE WINDOW IN HER CHAMBER and watched a group of boys fighting with wooden swords. She heard one of them yell that it was his turn to play Laird MacHugh, and she soon learned that meant he got to win. There were always two winners on their pretend battlefield, Colm and Liam. She wondered if the laird and his brother knew how much they were admired by their clan.</p><p>The mischief-makers, Ethan and Tom, stood on the sidelines begging to be allowed to join in, but the older boys kept pushing them back and ignoring them. She was surprised the little ones gave up so easily. They put their heads together, giggled loudly, and then took off running around the side of the castle. They had already moved on to their next adventure.</p><p>Hearing the children\u2019s laughter lightened Gabrielle\u2019s mood. She had been so melancholy since Colm left, and he had been gone such a long time. Was he safe? Please God, keep him safe.</p><p>She knew what evil MacKenna was capable of, for there was proof that he had plotted Liam\u2019s torture and murder. In the last few days she had heard numerous stories about Laird MacKenna, and each one painted a picture of a tyrant who used others to carry out his sadistic plans. His loyalty to his clan went only as far as the benefit he received personally. If his followers displeased him, they were expelled, or worse, killed. He even used women and children as shields against hostile neighboring clans. Housing them near the fortress walls, he made sure any laird who dared attack the MacKenna holding knew they were first killing these deterrents.</p><p>As Gabrielle listened to each horrendous tale, she thought back to the man she had met at Arbane Abbey. Laird MacKenna\u2019s generosity to the monks had no doubt been part of his scheme. The abbot had been deceived, and so had she. At his introduction, Gabrielle had thought the man amiable and attractive, and now that she knew the truth, she admonished herself for making judgments based on appearance. She had been wrong about him, and she had been wrong about Colm as well. Had she only looked at Colm\u2019s rough exterior, she would never have seen the heart of the man.</p><p>She tried not to think about MacKenna and what must be happening, but late at night when she was huddled under the covers, sleep would elude her, and her imagination would run rampant. All sorts of horrible images would come into her mind. She would imagine Colm lying injured, all alone, with no one to help him.</p><p>The possibility that he might die was too unbearable to consider. His clan needed him.</p><p>Shoving one worry from her mind, it settled on another. Why hadn\u2019t she heard from her father? There had been enough time for him to have gotten word to her or to the Buchanans. The longer she waited to hear, the more convinced she became that Wellingshire was under siege and that King John\u2019s soldiers had taken him captive. Gabrielle knew her father would never surrender.</p><p>So many were suffering now...and all because of a lie. Gabrielle hoped that one day she would know why the woman had said such heinous things about her. How could she so blithely destroy someone she didn\u2019t know? Where was her conscience? Had Isla felt any remorse? Or had she, like so many others, discovered a way to justify her evil deeds?</p><p>Gabrielle didn\u2019t have any answers. She knew only that fear could paralyze her if she allowed it. She needed to keep busy. If she worked hard enough and moved fast enough, there would be no time to worry.</p><p>Now, as she straightened up her chamber, she said another prayer that God would watch over her father and Colm.</p><p>Feeling a chill in the air, she went to the window to lower the tapestry. Before the heavy fabric fell into place, she glanced once again at the boys playing below. Something caught her eye and she quickly pushed the curtain back.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear Lord.\u201d</p><p>She picked up her skirts, threw the door open, and ran as fast as she could. She nearly broke her neck flying down the stairs.</p><p>Liam was in the hall when he heard her shout. He kicked a chair out of his way as he came running. \u201cGabrielle, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d He caught her as she tried to run past him.</p><p>\u201cEthan...Tom...with swords,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cYes, I saw the boys playing outside, but what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal swords,\u201d she stammered. \u201cThey\u2019ve got real\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to continue. Liam understood what she was trying to tell him. He was much faster than she was and had already vanished down the second set of stairs. Gabrielle pushed a clump of hair out of her eyes and took a deep breath, then picked up her skirts again and chased after him.</p><p>There weren\u2019t any blood-curdling screams, which was a good indication the boys hadn\u2019t cut themselves. Still, she wanted to make certain they were all right. By the time she reached the first floor, she had picked up a good amount of speed. The door was just closing as she ran outside. It struck her on the hip, knocking her off balance and sending her spinning down the steps into the courtyard. She might have been able to save herself from falling on her face if her legs hadn\u2019t gotten caught up in her gown. She tripped over her own feet and once again went flying through the air, though this time she was sure to land on her head.</p><p>Colm saved her from breaking her neck. He had Tom wrapped firmly in one arm when he saw her. Tossing the boy to Christien, he grabbed for Gabrielle and she landed against his chest with a thud.</p><p>Gabrielle uttered an unladylike expletive she hoped no one heard, looked up, and only then realized she was in Colm\u2019s arms. She was so happy to see him, she kissed him. He hadn\u2019t shaved, and she felt the bristles of his beard against her cheek. He squeezed her just enough to let her know he was happy to see her, too. At least that is what she wanted to believe.</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cYou are well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the battle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the outcome?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs expected.\u201d</p><p>She knew he wasn\u2019t going to tell her anything more, and though she thought he could have been a little less rude about it, she was too happy to see him to let it irritate her.</p><p>Liam walked past them with Ethan tucked under his arm. The boy was yelling for Liam to put him down so that he could get his sword. With Tom in tow, Christien followed them inside. The child chattered away and didn\u2019t seem to mind that the guard paid no attention.</p><p>For a moment Gabrielle and Colm were alone. \u201cI have missed you,\u201d she said.</p><p>She hoped he would tell her that he had also missed her, but he only gave her a quick nod. And then he broke her heart.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, I know I told you I would marry you in six months\u2019 time...\u201d he began.</p><p>\u201cYes, and a month almost has already passed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how long it\u2019s been. I can no longer keep my promise.\u201d</p><p>Willa stopped him from saying more. \u201cLaird, begging a minute of your time...\u201d she called as she approached, wiping her hands on her apron. \u201cThose little imps have been at it again. They\u2019ve gotten into the pens in the back and terrorized my poor hens, and now they won\u2019t lay their eggs. I swear I saw one of them hide when Ethan and Tom ran past. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to ban them from the yard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll right, Willa.

The woman was forever trying to leave him.</p><p>Calling for Braeden to take over and answer the remaining questions, Colm headed for the stables.</p><p>Gabrielle had disappeared before he finished his statement, and therefore she did not understand what he had been trying to tell her\u2014that there would be no marriage in five months because he could not wait five months to bed her, and that the last month had been torture and he couldn\u2019t continue this way. He couldn\u2019t be in the same room with her without thinking about what he wanted to do to her. It was getting ridiculous. She would walk up the stairs; he would walk down. She walked into a room; he walked out. She had no idea the power she held over him, and so he had done everything he could to stay away from her.</p> <p>Since she was so innocent, she couldn\u2019t possibly know how her touch affected him. But after they were married, he would take his time showing her how crazed she could make him.</p><p>He caught up with her as she was opening Rogue\u2019s stall. He reached around her and kicked the gate shut, then ordered her guards to leave. Without questioning, they filed outside and waited at the stable doors.</p><p>Colm wasn\u2019t gentle as he forced her to turn around and face him. There were tears in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou are not leaving,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cAs you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you are not leaving me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut Colm\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not leaving me.\u201d His voice shook with emotion.</p><p>She pushed against his chest, but she couldn\u2019t budge him. \u201cI cannot stay here,\u201d she cried out. \u201cI can\u2019t. I won\u2019t be able to stop chasing you and kissing you and demanding your attention. I know you think you can keep avoiding me, but you can\u2019t, Colm. I can be relentless when it\u2019s something I want.\u201d She took a breath and whispered, \u201cAnd I want you.\u201d</p><p>And there it was, out in the open for him to accept or reject. She looked up at him. He\u2019d gone completely still. She wasn\u2019t even sure if he was still breathing. She knew she\u2019d shocked him by pouring her heart out to him. It was unseemly for a lady to admit she felt passion, but it was too late to take the words back, and Gabrielle wouldn\u2019t have wanted to anyway.</p><p>\u201cYou say you cannot marry me, and I will accept your decision,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if I stayed, it wouldn\u2019t matter if we were married or not. I would still chase you, and eventually I would wear you down. You could not get away from me.\u201d</p><p>He stroked the side of her face with the back of his hand as he struggled to find the words to give her. \u201cThere are times I don\u2019t know what to think of you. You constantly astound me. You save my brother\u2019s life, and ask nothing in return. I offer you marriage, and you worry that I will ruin my life. You have been dragged through Hell, and you show only kindness. Now you think I reject you, and you open your heart to me. I don\u2019t know how this miracle came to pass, but I cannot imagine living the rest of my life without you. I want you, Gabrielle, and I will not wait five months to have you. We will marry now.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR</p><p>T HE WEDDING WOULD TAKE PLACE IN TWO WEEKS. IT WAS AS long as Colm was willing to wait, and he believed fourteen days was more than enough time to prepare for the celebration.</p> <p>Maurna and Willa were frantic. Everything needed to be perfect for their laird and his bride. Maurna took charge of the women who would give the keep a proper scrubbing while Willa and her helpers began making their special recipes. There would be pheasant, fully dressed and trimmed; stuffed pigs; pullets, of course\u2014four dozen would do nicely\u2014meat pies; and berry tarts. Honey would be mixed in almost every sweet dessert. The best wine would be served.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be a vision, milady, floating down the stairs in your finery,\u201d Maurna said. \u201cFather Gelroy will hear you say your vows outside in the courtyard. There will be pretty flowers to garnish your hair and more flowers will be strewn in a circle around you and our laird, and the priest as well. Father thought the ceremony should take place at Arbane Abbey. As he explained, you are a princess of St. Biel and should have a royal wedding, but our laird wouldn\u2019t hear of it. He isn\u2019t explaining why, but Willa and I think it\u2019s because he knows his clan would want to join in the celebration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be a grand day,\u201d Willa predicted, \u201cand here before you know it.\u201d</p><p>The best-laid plans had a way of changing.</p><p>GABRIELLE RECEIVED JOYOUS NEWS from her father. Laird Buchanan came to the MacHugh holding to tell her that he had received a message from Baron Geoffrey.</p><p>\u201cYour father is well. He has not been harmed by the king, nor have his estates been seized. He knows that you are living with the MacHugh clan, and he wants you to know that he will be here soon to see you, and to explain what happened with the king.</p><p>\u201cThere is more news,\u201d he added, looking at Colm. \u201cYour father believes you will be going home with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows I have been banned. Why would my father think I could go into England with him?\u201d she said.</p><p>Brodick had no answer.</p><p>Not an hour later, while Colm and Brodick discussed the trouble the new Monroe laird was stirring up, one of the MacHugh soldiers on duty at the drawbridge came to the gate of the courtyard to announce that an envoy from King John was asking permission to speak to Lady Gabrielle.</p><p>\u201cThere are a bishop and three other holy men, along with a few servants, traveling with the envoy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey insist that you will want to hear what they have to say. They brought a scroll with them and a gift for Lady Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd soldiers?\u201d Colm asked. \u201cDid the envoy bring the king\u2019s soldiers as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did, Laird. Twelve in all. They have already placed their weapons on the ground to show their good intentions.\u201d</p><p>Colm scoffed. \u201cThe English don\u2019t have good intentions.\u201d</p><p>Colm was going to refuse to let any of them cross his drawbridge, but Brodick urged him to reconsider. \u201cAren\u2019t you curious to know what they have to say? And if you don\u2019t like what you hear, you could always\u2014\u201d He stopped when he realized Gabrielle was listening.</p><p>Colm gave his order: the soldiers would remain outside, but the others could come forward.</p><p>The shout to lower the bridge echoed down to the guards.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, go inside,\u201d Colm said.</p><p>\u201cAs you say.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to stay. She was as curious as Brodick to find out what the envoy had to say, but she would not oppose Colm in front of his ally and friend. Besides, she knew protesting wouldn\u2019t do any good. Once Colm had his jaw set, nothing could change his mind.</p><p>Although no command was given, MacHughs began to line up on either side of the worn path from the drawbridge to the courtyard. Most were armed and ready for any outcome. Gabrielle thought they were being overly cautious. What harm could one envoy, some holy men, and a handful of servants cause? None of the priests or servants would be armed, and the envoy would not dare to carry a sword. To do so would be a grave insult to the laird.</p><p>Stephen appeared at Gabrielle\u2019s shoulder and explained what was happening as they made their way into the castle. \u201cIt is believed that the procession is coming for you, Princess, with the intent of taking you away. The clan knows there are English soldiers waiting outside the walls, and word has spread that the envoy brings news to you. He could be carrying an order for you to return to England.\u201d He nodded toward the men standing on either side of the path. \u201cThe MacHughs are letting it be known that they will not let you be taken away from them without a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese men came here unarmed, and are few at that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cBut they will report back to the soldiers waiting outside the walls, and those soldiers will tell King John what has happened here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere has been so much deceit of late. How can we even be certain the envoy comes from King John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must assume that he does and be prepared,\u201d Stephen answered gravely.</p><p>Just as he reached for the door, Liam pulled it open and came outside. He nodded to Gabrielle, stepped aside so that she could pass, then crossed the courtyard to take his place beside his brother.</p><p>They were a fearsome sight. Colm stood in the middle of the warriors. Liam and Braeden were on his left, Brodick to his right. Christien and Lucien joined the line next to Braeden. Faust went to the opposite side to stand beside Brodick.</p><p>\u201cGo and take your place with the others,\u201d she said to Stephen. \u201cI will stay inside and cause you no worry.\u201d</p><p>Stephen bowed his head and turned to do as she asked.</p><p>The door had just closed behind her when it was flung open again as Father Gelroy ran inside, looking like a pack of wild dogs was on his heels.</p><p>\u201cThe bishop has come,\u201d he told her, \u201cand I\u2019m not ready to receive him!\u201d</p><p>He rushed ahead of her to the steps. Then, remembering courtesy, Gelroy stopped suddenly and let her go in front of him. But as soon as they reached the second level, he cut around her and raced up the next flight. He didn\u2019t have time to change his robes, but wanted to at least wipe the dust off and wash his hands and face.</p><p>Gabrielle paced in the hall while she waited for someone to come and tell her the news.</p><p>Panting from his haste, Father Gelroy joined her a moment later. \u201cI\u2019m to stay with you until I am called outside. Our laird will not allow felicitations until the envoy has explained the purpose of his visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would stand by the window so that I would see what is happening,\u201d said Gabrielle, \u201cbut those outside would also see me. It would be unseemly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, it would,\u201d the holy man agreed.</p><p>\u201cAnd it would be wrong to try to overhear what is being said, but if you were to stand slightly closer to the window, you couldn\u2019t help but hear some of the conversation. I do not see any wrong if you were to just happen to walk toward the window...\u201d</p><p>Gelroy nodded. \u201cNo, no, of course it wouldn\u2019t be wrong, and I am certainly in need of fresh air.\u201d</p><p>The priest positioned himself at the edge of the window with the hope he wouldn\u2019t be noticed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just in time to see the procession,\u201d he reported. \u201cThere is pomp and splendor. The bishop is dressed in his rich finery, riding a docile horse. He\u2019s not a young man, but he\u2019s not so old, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the envoy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalking he is, with a scroll tucked under his arm. His clothes are unremarkable, and I must say he seems the jittery sort, for he keeps darting quick looks to his left and right. I think the poor fellow believes he will be pounced on any minute.\u201d Gelroy chuckled as he added, \u201cAnd well he could. I remember such a feeling myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of the others?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt is quite a procession. First comes the bishop, then the envoy, then, one at a time, the monks, and last the servants. I recognize a few faces. They are indeed from the abbey.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle kept edging closer to Gelroy, hoping she could sneak a peek. The priest shooed her back.</p><p>\u201cThe bishop can see straight through this window, Lady Gabrielle. Do not let him see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me what is happening now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bishop is still atop his horse, but he has stopped. A servant is coming forward to take the reins and aid the bishop.\u201d</p><p>Gelroy made the sign of the cross and folded his hands as though in prayer. Then he explained. \u201cThe bishop decided to give his blessing. If he had hoped the lairds would bow to him, he was mistaken. None of them have moved.\u201d</p><p>The bishop didn\u2019t seem offended that Colm and the others didn\u2019t drop to their knees. The servant stood by his side and held the reins, but the bishop didn\u2019t dismount.</p><p>The envoy came forward. Assuming the warrior standing in the center of the stone-faced men to be Laird MacHugh, he addressed him.</p><p>\u201cHis Highness, King John of England, sends word to Lady Gabrielle. She is here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Colm answered, \u201cbut you will give me the king\u2019s message, and I will then decide if you can speak to her.\u201d</p><p>The envoy was quick to agree. He cleared his throat, straightened his shoulders, and took a step forward. He then began his rehearsed speech as a herald would do, in a loud booming voice so that many would hear.</p><p>\u201cThere has been a terrible injustice done to Lady Gabrielle. She has been wrongly vilified and persecuted. His Highness now knows and has absolute proof that the lady is innocent. The king wants it known that Baron Geoffrey of Wellingshire will be lauded and richly respected for his vigilance over his daughter, and Lady Gabrielle, a treasure to England, will from this day forward be called Princess Gabrielle of St. Biel and friend to England\u2019s king.\u201d</p><p>The envoy paused to await a response. It was not long in coming.</p><p>\u201cEvery man here knows Lady Gabrielle is innocent. We do not need your king to tell us so,\u201d Colm said.</p><p>\u201cKing John will be pleased to hear that you and others have seen through the treacherous lies told and wrongly believed by many. He wishes to prove his sincerity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how will he do that?\u201d Colm asked.</p><p>The envoy held out the scroll so all could see the seal was unbroken.</p><p>\u201cTo prove sincerity,\u201d he repeated, \u201cand in hopes of forgiveness for this grievous injustice, His Royal Highness hereby confers the land known as Finney\u2019s Flat to Princess Gabrielle. He has signed his name and affixed his royal seal as his solemn promise that the land will never belong to England again. He also has had it written that God may strike him if he does not keep his word.\u201d</p><p>The envoy took another step forward and with both hands held out the scroll. Colm took it and handed it to Liam. \u201cWhy do these priests travel with you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cFor protection, Laird MacHugh,\u201d he answered. \u201cIt was hoped...sincerely hoped...that you would hear the message from my king and not harm the messenger.\u201d</p><p>Colm glanced at Brodick before speaking to the envoy again. \u201cHoly men would not save you from my fist if I were displeased with your message.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The envoy swallowed loudly, and the bishop, hearing what the laird had just said, gave yet another blessing. \u201cAnd are you displeased, Laird?\u201d the envoy asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I am not, and I do not kill messengers, even when the news is not to my liking. You are welcome here as long as it takes you to refresh yourselves. The others, too.\u201d</p><p>The envoy was weak with relief. \u201cI thank you, Laird, but there is more of the apology to give, and more needs said about the gift. His Highness wishes to hear Princess Gabrielle has forgiven him. She must say the words to me so that I may say them to my king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy clan will also hear this apology from your king.\u201d He signaled to Braeden, who shouted the command.</p> <p>Within minutes men, women, and children surrounded the courtyard and stood silent, watching.</p><p>\u201cGo and get your princess,\u201d Colm ordered her guards.</p><p>The door was thrown open and held by two of the men who had been standing guard. A moment passed and then another as all eyes watched the entrance.</p><p>And then Gabrielle stepped out into the light. An aid sounded a herald\u2019s trumpet as the envoy said, \u201cHail to Princess Gabrielle.\u201d He then dropped to his knees and bowed his head. The visitors from the abbey also fell to their knees to show their respect.</p><p>Startled, Gabrielle looked at Colm, uncertain of what to do. It was not appropriate for these men to kneel. Colm wasn\u2019t giving her any help. He simply stared at her and waited for her to come to him.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t disappoint him. Liam moved back so that she could stand beside Colm.</p><p>\u201cYou must give them permission to stand,\u201d Stephen instructed in a whisper.</p><p>Her cheeks flushed with embarrassment. \u201cYou may stand.\u201d</p><p>She surprised everyone then when she gave the envoy instructions. \u201cYou bow to Laird MacHugh, for you are on his land by his good graces, but you do not kneel to me. If the laird wants you on your knees, he will tell you so.\u201d</p><p>A murmur of approval came from the MacHughs.</p><p>Colm gave the envoy permission to speak, and the envoy repeated his prepared speech. The cheers were deafening when he finished. He waited until the noise had died down and then asked, \u201cMay I tell His Royal Highness that you forgive him?\u201d</p> <p>Gabrielle was about to answer the envoy and tell him yes, she did forgive the king, but something held her back. Was this another trick?</p><p>\u201cI will consider it. You will have your answer before you leave here.\u201d</p><p>The envoy looked shocked that she didn\u2019t immediately agree, but bowed to her wishes. \u201cI will await your answer.\u201d</p><p>Liam took Gabrielle\u2019s hand. \u201cYou have always had the acceptance and respect of this clan, but now you have their love.\u201d</p><p>Colm knocked his hand away. \u201cYou will give your love to another and leave Gabrielle alone.\u201d</p><p>Liam laughed. He winked at Gabrielle and said, \u201cAs you say, Laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaird, we must celebrate,\u201d Braeden said, \u201cfor now we have a princess and Finney\u2019s Flat.\u201d</p><p>Colm agreed but didn\u2019t want any of the outsiders to come into his home, not even the bishop. With the weather pleasant and no rain cloud in sight, he called for tables and benches to be carried outside and a barrel of ale to be brought from the buttery.</p> <p>The bishop was finally removed from his horse, and he and his monks were given places at the table. Still suspicious of their English visitors, the MacHughs were reticent to be welcoming to the envoy and his men.</p><p>Gabrielle was even more wary than the MacHughs. She kept an eye on the envoy as he made his way through the gathering crowd. Distracted, she barely paid attention to the conversation next to her until she heard Colm praise Father Gelroy. With each word he said, the priest seemed to grow taller.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps soon, Laird, you will wish to build Father Gelroy a chapel,\u201d Gabrielle suggested.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cThe statue of St. Biel the abbot has kept safe for you is soon to come here,\u201d the bishop said. \u201cPerhaps you will name your chapel after the saint. I have not heard of him,\u201d he admitted, \u201cbut so many were sainted before my time. Would you know how many miracles he has performed?\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle didn\u2019t have the faintest idea. Father Gelroy saw her hesitation and said, \u201cSt. Biel was a good and holy man. I\u2019m certain the royal guards could tell us the number of miracles.\u201d</p><p>When the bishop left to get refreshment, she whispered to Gelroy, \u201cI am ashamed that I have forgotten so much about St. Biel. I, too, will seek instruction from my guards.\u201d</p><p>Father Gelroy spotted Maurna carrying out a tray of food. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d he said, dismissing the talk of saints. \u201cThe meal is ready.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle looked around in astonishment as MacHugh women carried huge trenchers filled with meat pies and bread and game birds. One of the women crossed to the courtyard with yet another tray. Everyone was bringing food to share.</p><p>She looked around for Colm, but he had disappeared. As she set out to find him her way through the gathering throng was interrupted by well-wishers who wanted to congratulate her. She was patted on her back, her arms, and once on her head by a robust woman.</p><p>When she finally had threaded her way to the side of the castle, she looked for a quiet spot. She needed time to think. Something in the back of her mind gnawed at her. Although the envoy\u2019s announcement was good news, something wasn\u2019t right. What that was she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Colm found her sitting on a stone. \u201cGabrielle, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPondering.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her into his arms, kissed her, and then tried to get her to go back to the celebration.</p><p>\u201cI think there may be trickery by King John, but I don\u2019t know what it might be,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cI will read the scroll carefully, and if you like, I will ask Liam and Brodick to read it as well,\u201d he assured her. \u201cYou are right not to trust.\u201d</p><p>As Colm went to find Brodick and Liam, and head inside, Gabrielle returned to the feast. Maurna forced her to sit and taste some of the offerings. Since she had prepared one of the meat pies, she insisted that Gabrielle be given a good helping.</p><p>Conversation whirled around her. There was much excitement about the MacHughs owning Finney\u2019s Flat. They could triple their crops even if they let some of the ground lie fallow. Their joyful enthusiasm made her smile. But still she kept a skeptical eye on the envoy.</p><p>Why would the king give her Finney\u2019s Flat? And how were his lapdogs, the barons, involved? For surely they were. Aye, if there was trickery, they were behind it. The king called the land his gift. The first time she\u2019d heard of Finney\u2019s Flat, it was to be her dowry. But now? What could the reason be? Certainly not the king\u2019s generosity. He didn\u2019t know the meaning of the word.</p><p>He wanted her forgiveness. There it was. Suddenly she knew exactly what was in the king\u2019s mind. She slapped the top of the table causing quite a startle, then jumped to her feet and stormed over to the envoy.</p><p>The celebrating crowd might not have noticed Gabrielle\u2019s behavior, but all of them saw her guards racing to her. By the time she reached the envoy, Christien was standing beside her.</p><p>\u201cStand,\u201d she ordered the envoy.</p><p>The laughter died down and a hush fell over the people</p><p>\u201cYou will answer my questions,\u201d she demanded. \u201cDo you go directly back to King John?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I first go to the abbey,\u201d the envoy answered, glancing around at the startled faces staring at him. \u201cI will stay the night there and then continue on my journey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre there barons also waiting to hear what news you bring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Princess, I\u2019m certain there are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps those barons are Coswold and Percy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know all who anxiously wait to hear that you have forgiven King John.\u201d Frowning, he added, \u201cAnd that is why I wait as well.\u201d</p><p>The crowd edged closer. Gabrielle saw Joan watching her and the bishop standing beside her.</p><p>\u201cI know what the king and his barons are about,\u201d she said, her voice rising with her anger. \u201cIf I accept the king\u2019s apology, I am also accepting his rule. Is that not true? I am no longer free of him.\u201d</p><p>The envoy looked at his shoes when he spoke. \u201cI cannot lie, and so I will tell you that Finney\u2019s Flat will be a dowry for you to bring to the man the king will choose for you to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I don\u2019t accept his apology, then Finney\u2019s Flat returns to the king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not certain, but there would be the possibility.\u201d</p><p>If a bread crumb were to drop to the ground, it would have made more noise than the clan.</p><p>\u201cDid the king not consider that I might already be married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did, and if you were, then Finney\u2019s Flat would belong to your husband, and the king would not interfere.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle looked around her and raised her voice to proclaim. \u201cI am married this day.\u201d</p><p>The envoy took what she said as true and asked, \u201cTo Laird MacHugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cFinney\u2019s Flat belongs to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not married this day!\u201d Joan shouted. \u201cYou cannot deceive us. You boldly tell a lie in front of the bishop. You will burn in hell for such an offense.\u201d</p><p>Incensed, Gabrielle brushed past the envoy. \u201cI am married this day.\u201d</p><p>Joan backed away as Gabrielle came closer. The anger she saw in Gabrielle\u2019s eyes frightened her, and she feared she would strike her.</p><p>\u201cI am married this day, and Finney\u2019s Flat belongs to Laird MacHugh,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>A rumble of agreement rolled through the crowd, growing louder and louder until the sound was deafening.</p><p>Once the noise had died down, Gabrielle spoke again. \u201cWould you like proof? All of you wait here, and I will get it for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know you are married this day and Finney\u2019s Flat belongs to our laird,\u201d a man called out.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d another called and another.</p><p>Gabrielle stopped in front of the envoy. \u201cBut you, I think, require proof.\u201d</p><p>The envoy nodded. \u201cI must be able to tell King John with a certainty that you are married.\u201d He could feel the heat of the crowd\u2019s anger and called out, \u201cAnd Finney\u2019s Flat will be Laird MacHugh\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Christien ran ahead of Gabrielle and held the door for her. \u201cIs the proof inside?\u201d he asked, grinning.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she answered.</p><p>Followed by her guards, Gabrielle ran up the stairs, paused to make herself presentable by smoothing her bliaut and pushing a strand of hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to be married this day?\u2019 Stephen asked.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>In the hall, Colm had just finished reading the scroll. He was handing it to Brodick while Liam and Father Gelroy, goblets in hand, waited their turn.</p><p>Gabrielle took a deep breath and entered the hall. \u201cColm, may I have a moment of your time?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</p><p>G ABRIELLE WAS INDEED MARRIED THIS DAY.</p><p>The ceremony was performed in front of the hearth in the great hall. There wasn\u2019t any pomp or splendor befitting a princess from St. Biel and a powerful laird from the Highlands. It was done quickly and quietly. Even though it was nearly impossible for anyone to see into the hall from outside, Gabrielle insisted that the tapestries be pulled down to cover the windows that faced the courtyard below and those that overlooked the back garden and the lake beyond. She wasn\u2019t taking any chances that the envoy or the bishop or that horrid woman, Joan, might see what was happening.</p><p>Since Brodick was her only relative in attendance, it became his duty to give her to Colm and grant permission for the marriage to take place when asked to do so by Father Gelroy. Liam and Gabrielle\u2019s royal guards were witnesses.</p><p>Gabrielle didn\u2019t think she was nervous, but apparently she was, for when she was told to place her hand in Colm\u2019s, she trembled as though she had just suffered a terrible fright. The priest began his prayer, and the impact of what she was doing suddenly overwhelmed her. Her knees went weak and she could barely breathe. A vise was crushing her chest. She was becoming Colm\u2019s wife, now and forever.</p><p>In a daze, she watched as Colm placed a length of his plaid over their joined hands. He tilted her face up and looked into her eyes as he spoke his vows, and for the life of her, she couldn\u2019t comprehend a word he said. She had forgotten any Gaelic she ever knew. Then it was her turn. She whispered her vows in her mother\u2019s language. Father Gelroy stopped her and asked her to start over.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying, Princess Gabrielle,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Neither did she. She knew she had promised Colm something. She just couldn\u2019t remember what it was. Had she said that she would love and cherish him? Or had she thought that she should? And had she told him that she would be faithful and true? She hoped she had, but she couldn\u2019t be certain. For all she knew, she had promised to clean his stables for the rest of her days.</p><p>Bewildered, she looked at the priest. He didn\u2019t have an appalled look on his face, which she took as a good sign.</p><p>Now and forever, until death do they part.</p><p>The prayers were finished, and the blessing was given. She was as stiff as a board as Colm gathered her into his arms, but once he lowered his head and kissed her, she came alive again. His warmth stopped her trembling, and the tenderness in his kiss melted her fears.</p><p>\u201cYou are now man and wife.\u201d Father Gelroy was beaming his approval as he made the announcement.</p><p>Congratulations weren\u2019t shouted but given in hushed voices. The guards each made a low bow to their princess and her new husband and then, at Gabrielle\u2019s insistence, went down to the courtyard to join the clan\u2019s celebration. Colm allowed Liam to kiss Gabrielle\u2019s hand, but that was all he would permit, and Brodick snatched her away from Colm long enough to hug her.</p><p>\u201cWe must toast this marriage,\u201d Liam said.</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely suggestion,\u201d she blurted out. \u201cAnother time perhaps?\u201d</p><p>She grabbed the priest\u2019s arm and pulled him toward the stairs as she gave him instructions on what he should say to the envoy. \u201cYou will please tell the envoy that yes, you did marry us, but you won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colm stopped her. Throwing his arm around her and anchoring her to his side, he said, \u201cI will take care of this matter. There is no need to rush.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t agree. She had told the envoy that she would bring him proof of her marriage. Surely he would be suspicious if she made him wait long.</p><p>She bowed her head. \u201cAs you say.\u201d</p><p>Liam burst into laughter, and when Brodick asked what was so amusing, Liam was happy to explain. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo Gabrielle, \u2018as you say\u2019 means that she doesn\u2019t agree and will do the complete opposite. She thinks to placate Colm with those words, but we have all caught on to her real meaning.\u201d</p><p>Brodick nodded. \u201c\u2018Yes\u2019 means \u2018no,\u2019 and \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018yes\u2019?\u201d He pounded Colm on the shoulder. \u201cAt least she tried to placate you. My wife doesn\u2019t pay any attention to what I say.\u201d</p><p>Brodick didn\u2019t seem to be bothered by his wife\u2019s willfulness. In fact, he looked pleased by it.</p><p>\u201cLaird MacHugh, do you want me to go outside and have a word with the envoy?\u201d Gelroy asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou will stay here,\u201d Colm ordered.</p><p>\u201cBut when I do face him, will you tell me what I am to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will tell the truth,\u201d Colm said, \u201cbut you won\u2019t mention when the ceremony took place.\u201d</p><p>The laird\u2019s frown still had the power to make Gelroy shake in his boots. He tried not to let it show as he waited for his next instruction.</p><p>Liam insisted upon a toast. He ran to the buttery and returned with a jug of wine. Pouring each of them a full goblet, he wished the couple a long and happy life. \u201cAnd as you say, Gabrielle, to a perfect marriage,\u201d he teased.</p> <p>Gabrielle was puzzled. A perfect marriage? Had she said something about their marriage being perfect?</p><p>\u201cColm, did I promise that when I spoke my vows?\u201d she asked. \u201cIf I did, I am very sorry. Our marriage will not be perfect, and I cannot promise there will be no trouble. Look at the deception I have caused on this our wedding day. I didn\u2019t lie to the envoy, but I did mislead him. And I corrupted your clan as well, for I made them complicit in my deception. Do you not wonder what I will do tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Had she expected Colm to be sympathetic to her distress, she was mistaken. He thought her guilt amusing.</p><p>\u201cDeceit? Trouble? You have already become a MacHugh,\u201d he laughed.</p><p>He kissed her again and then grew serious. \u201cYou will tell me now what wedding gifts you want from me. On this your wedding day, I will refuse you nothing.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to think about it long. \u201cI would like you to build Father Gelroy his chapel and pledge to have it finished by this time next year. He will need it to have a fine altar and sturdy benches.\u201d</p> <p>Gelroy was overwhelmed by her thoughtfulness and generosity. Colm didn\u2019t seem at all surprised. \u201cIt will be done. What else would you like?\u201d</p><p>Again there was no hesitation. \u201cTradition is important to me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so I would like you to give me the same gift my father gave my mother.\u201d</p><p>He waited for her to tell him what it was, but she didn\u2019t say another word.</p><p>\u201cWhen am I to know what this gift is?\u201d he urged.</p><p>\u201cEventually.\u201d</p><p>The envoy was waiting with the bishop for Gabrielle to return. His face whitened when he saw Colm striding toward him.</p><p>\u201cLady MacHugh has told me you require proof that she is my wife. She did tell you we were married, did she not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Laird...that is, Laird, another did suggest the possibility that perhaps\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you know how fortunate you are to still be standing? You should be dead, for you have insinuated that my wife lied to you. Is that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, I didn\u2019t think so. Another did perhaps think that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wife does not lie.\u201d His voice had turned deadly.</p><p>\u201cYes, Laird. She speaks only the truth.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle moved closer to Colm. She stared at the envoy and no one else. She didn\u2019t know if Joan was still in the crowd watching, but she hoped she had left and wouldn\u2019t cause any more trouble.</p><p>Father Gelroy stepped forward. \u201cI know for a fact that Laird MacHugh and Lady MacHugh are married. I am the priest who administered the holy sacrament. I heard them speak their vows to each other, and I blessed their union.\u201d With a dramatic gesture to the sky, he said, \u201cMay a bolt of lightning strike me down this very second if I am lying.\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyes to heaven and waited, then nodding said, \u201cGod knows I am telling the truth, and so should you.\u201d</p><p>The bishop wanted to get back to the abbey before nightfall so he could sleep in his own bed instead of the hard ground. \u201cI will testify that Father Gelroy speaks the truth. This issue should now be settled to everyone\u2019s satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>The envoy was convinced. \u201cI am satisfied. Because of this marriage, you now have Finney\u2019s Flat, Laird MacHugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur laird also has the treasure of St. Biel,\u201d Gelroy said, smiling with relief at Gabrielle. The priest did not think he needed to explain his meaning. Everyone who looked at Gabrielle could see what a treasure she was.</p><p>Gabrielle blushed at the priest\u2019s compliment. \u201cI think not, Father. My husband will have to be content with the land, for he will not get a treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as possible,\u201d said the envoy, \u201cI will have heralds sent to each clan to announce that Princess Gabrielle has been proven innocent of the accusations made against her, that your marriage is valid, and that Finney\u2019s Flat is now yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have the power to proclaim this?\u201d Gelroy asked.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later the envoy and the bishop took their leave, and Gabrielle was never so happy to see anyone go. Now she could relax. Or so she thought.</p><p>One worry left, and another arrived. This was her wedding night.</p><p>The MacHugh clan was slow to disperse. They had much to celebrate. Their laird had returned victorious over their enemies, the MacKennas; their holdings now included Finney\u2019s Flat; and their beloved laird had taken a wife. As Father Gelroy reminded them, they were truly blessed. With dusk approaching, the festivities began to die down. The tables and benches were returned to the castle, and the people made their way to their cottages weary, but happy.</p><p>Liam and Colm walked with Brodick to the stables, as it was time that Brodick headed home as well.</p><p>\u201cYou are not through with the MacKennas,\u201d Brodick warned. \u201cFor every one you have killed, another will step forward. They multiply like rats. They\u2019ll soon have a new laird, and I wager he will be as much a bastard as Owen was. I hope he did not die well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he did not,\u201d Colm said quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou are our ally, Brodick,\u201d Liam reminded him. \u201cThey will come after you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI look forward to it,\u201d he said.</p><p>The stable boy lead Brodick\u2019s horse to him. \u201cYour debt is paid,\u201d he told Colm, \u201cbut now I think you owe another one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would that debt be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forced her on me,\u201d Colm said drily. \u201cAnd I am grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is an easy way to repay me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat might that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive one of your daughters to one of my sons in marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe church will not allow it,\u201d Liam said. \u201cYou are related to Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly by marriage. My wife\u2019s uncle is not a blood relative. The arranged union would be valid, and your daughter would come to my son with a fat dowry.\u201d</p><p>Colm laughed. \u201cLet me guess. Finney\u2019s Flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Finney\u2019s Flat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour plan is contingent upon my wife giving me daughters and your wife giving you sons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will come to pass,\u201d Brodick said. \u201cThough I will be ahead of you, for my Gillian is already with child, and you can\u2019t bed Gabrielle for what? Five months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had thought to wait that long, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought to? What of her reputation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWord will spread of her innocence, and if the Englishman was telling the truth, a proclamation will be made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think that will happen quickly?\u201d Brodick asked. \u201cColm, you did give her six months.\u201d</p><p>Resignedly, Colm answered, \u201cIf that is what Gabrielle wants, I will acquiesce.\u201d</p><p>Brodick and Liam laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou think you can last that long? She is nearly as pretty as my wife,\u201d Brodick said.</p><p>\u201cOf course I can wait. I have more discipline than either of you.\u201d</p><p>Colm headed back to the castle. Liam and Brodick watched him walk away.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Brodick asked.</p><p>\u201cMy brother is strong-willed and disciplined. I\u2019d give him at least one night before he changes his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give him one hour.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-SIX</p><p>T HE WAIT WAS AGONIZING. IT SEEMED TO GABRIELLE THAT half the night had already passed since she had bathed and washed her hair. The tub had been removed from her room, the covers on her bed had been turned back, and two more logs had been added to the fire.</p><p>Every minute felt like an hour, but her hair was still dripping wet so she knew it couldn\u2019t have been all that long since she had washed it. Still, it seemed an eternity.</p><p>Gabrielle wore her white sleeping gown\u2014a fine gossamer fabric adorned with gold and silver threads sewn into the neckline. She had wanted to wear her blue gown, but there were too many wrinkles in it from the packing. She smoothed a crease from the gown and sat in front of the hearth to brush her hair by the fire. The room was warm and cozy, and after such a long and frantic day, she should have been exhausted. But she wasn\u2019t. She was wide awake and in a near panic.</p><p>Where was he?</p><p>He had said he couldn\u2019t wait to have her. True, the wedding had happened sooner than he had expected, but they were married now. He hadn\u2019t changed his mind, had he?</p><p>Every sound made her stomach flutter in anticipation and fear. As she continued brushing her hair, she tried to think about less worrisome things. The weather had been nice today, and the meat pie she ate for dinner was quite flavorful.</p><p>What was taking him so long? Were the demands of the clan so much more important than her, even now on this, their wedding night?</p><p>Oh, how she wanted to get this over and done with. She had been told enough about the physical act between a man and a woman to be both curious and frightened.</p><p>She decided to compare it to her dislocated finger. When she was nine years old, Gabrielle had fallen from a stone wall she\u2019d been climbing. Her little finger made an odd popping sound and was bent in a bizarre direction. It hurt like it had been stung by a nest of hornets, but her father had known just what to do. While Stephen held her still, her father popped the finger back into place, and the hurt immediately went away. She had known what was going to happen and had dreaded it, but once it was finished, she didn\u2019t have to worry about it any longer.</p><p>As far as she was concerned, the marriage act was much like that: dread, pain, forgotten.</p><p>When her arm began to ache, she put her brush down. The curl was back in her hair, and the long strands were just a little damp now. She stared at the floor and tried to concentrate on something pleasant. Some of the water from her bath had spilled over the tub. She had helped mop it up, but there were still damp spots on the floor. She stared at them as they slowly faded away.</p><p>Had Colm forgotten her?</p><p>Think only pleasant thoughts, she reminded herself. There was absolutely no need to get worked up.</p><p>Colm had been pleased with her gift of salt, and surprised. Gabrielle suddenly realized she had forgotten to tell him that more would be coming, and by next year he would have more than enough to last his clan a good long time. He\u2019d have extra, too, that could be bartered for seed or anything else the clan needed.</p><p>Was she so unimportant to him?</p><p>Gabrielle felt herself becoming emotional. Maybe Colm was only being kind when he\u2019d told her he wanted her. And she had just thrown herself at him. But no, he wouldn\u2019t have done that, she decided. Colm was blunt and brutally honest. He wouldn\u2019t lie just to be kind. He didn\u2019t take much time to think about a woman\u2019s feelings. She doubted he\u2019d ever given them a thought.</p><p>Tears came into her eyes, and she knew that if she didn\u2019t do something about them, she would soon break down. Gabrielle rarely cried, but when she did, it took a long time for her to stop. She would drag out every last pain and heartache she had ever endured and weep over each one. Since leaving Wellingshire, her list of heartaches had grown considerably, and she estimated she would have to cry for a good week to get through them all.</p><p>Concentrating on pleasant matters wasn\u2019t working. She needed to get angry.</p><p>How dare Colm treat her this way. She sighed then because it wasn\u2019t working. The man had given her his name and his protection, and he had asked for nothing in return. No, she couldn\u2019t summon up much anger at all. Granted, it was rude of him to make her wait, but not cruel.</p><p>She moved on to the king\u2019s envoy. He had put her through Purgatory with his scroll and his suspicion. Still, he was only doing King John\u2019s bidding, and, in truth, he was an affable fellow. She couldn\u2019t blame the messenger or despise him for repeating the words he had been given.</p><p>Joan. What a shrew that woman was! She had such a contemptuous look on her face when she had challenged Gabrielle. Did she think that all she had to do was announce that she was going to marry Colm, and it would come to pass? Had she expected Gabrielle to wilt in front of her? Or cower? How dare she! Aye, she was a shrew and a hateful troublemaker as well.</p><p>There weren\u2019t any tears in Gabrielle\u2019s eyes now. If Joan were to walk into her room this minute, Gabrielle just might pick up her brush and pummel her with it. Picturing this made Gabrielle smile.</p><p>There. She was feeling ever so much better.</p><p>Footsteps sounded in the hall.</p><p>Colm. Oh God, he was finally coming to her.</p><p>She jumped up, then sat down, and jumped up again. Should she stand by the fire, or should she sit on the side of the bed? Did he expect her to be under the covers?</p><p>She decided to wait by the hearth. She also decided that it was important for her to remember to breathe. She was getting dizzy holding her breath.</p><p>Dread...pain...forgotten.</p><p>Colm knocked on the door, waited a second, then opened it and walked inside. He went completely still when he saw her.</p><p>She was a vision. The soft light from the embers behind her had turned her gown translucent. He could see the perfect shape of her body. Every curve was cast in a golden hue: her full breasts, her narrow waist, her shapely hips, her long legs. She was perfection, and more enticing to him than if she had been standing there wearing nothing at all.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to be leaving her this night or any other.</p><p>Gabrielle\u2019s hands were at her sides, and she stared into his eyes.</p><p>She knew this man.</p><p>Why was she so afraid? He would never hurt her. Dread drifted away. Aye, she knew him well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A width of Colm\u2019s plaid was thrown over his bare chest. In this light and in this small chamber he seemed so much taller and more muscular. She noticed everything about him. His hair was wet, and there were still drops of water on his chest indicating he had gone to the lake to wash, as did many of the other clansmen. The color of his eyes...the firm line of his jaw...his wide shoulders...</p><p>She wanted this man.</p><p>She stepped toward him. \u201cKnow you how handsome you are?\u201d she whispered softly.</p><p>His reply was raspy. \u201cI do not think about such things. When you know me better...\u201d</p> <p>She took another step toward him, eyes locked on his. He couldn\u2019t remember what he was saying. She brought the light scent of flowers with her as she moved closer, and all he could think of was touching her. She aroused him as no other woman could.</p><p>\u201cI know you, Colm.\u201d</p><p>With her fingertips she traced the scar that began at the tip of his shoulder and followed it down his arm. \u201cYour body tells your history.\u201d</p><p>He did not move as she slowly circled him, touching, caressing. \u201cYou are a warrior,\u201d she whispered as her fingers brushed across his shoulders. His muscles flexed and his skin felt warm to her touch. \u201cYou are a protector.\u201d</p><p>She gently stroked the side of his neck, and when she was again standing in front of him and just a breath away, she whispered again, \u201cI know you.\u201d</p> <p>Colm\u2019s eyes did not leave hers as he slowly removed her gown. Her cheeks became flushed, but she didn\u2019t shy away from him or shield her body. He pulled her into his arms and kissed her fiercely. Her body was so wonderfully soft, her skin silky and warm. His lips gently brushed across hers and then he wanted more. He made love to her with his kisses until passion engulfed him.</p><p>He carried her to the bed. She wasn\u2019t given time to pull the covers over herself. He quickly removed his plaid and covered her with his body. She gasped when his bare skin pressed intimately against hers.</p><p>Colm wanted to know every inch of her. He lingered over her mouth, then kissed the side of her neck, inhaled the sweet scent. He felt her heart beating under his, and when he kissed the base of her neck, she trembled. He lowered his head to caress her br**sts and kiss the valley between. His hands slid down her back, the curve of her spine.</p><p>Gabrielle loved the feel of him against her. She wrapped her arms around his neck as their kisses grew more demanding.</p><p>With each touch, Colm\u2019s need increased. His fingers slipped between her thighs. He felt her tense in reaction, but he would not be denied. She began to move restlessly against him.</p><p>The way he was stroking her was driving Gabrielle wild. He made her want more. He wouldn\u2019t let her deny him as he moved lower and lower to kiss every part of her. The sweet torment soon became unbearable. Her nails raked his shoulders as she demanded release.</p> <p>Her wild response made Colm burn to have her, and his own restraint vanished. He roughly pushed her legs apart and, kneeling between her thighs, he thrust inside her.</p><p>She cried out in pain and arched against him, but he soothed her with sweet words and touches. The pain was soon forgotten, and as he moved inside her, slowly at first, her h*ps pushed against his, and she moaned with pleasure. His thrusts became more powerful, less controlled. And suddenly she felt a rush of ecstasy. She screamed his name as she cl**axed, and she squeezed him tight as he found his own release and poured his seed into her.</p><p>For long moments neither of them moved, their harsh breathing the only sound. Gabrielle thought her heart would explode. Loving Colm was the most terrifyingly wonderful experience she had ever had.</p><p>She knew she had pleased him. Though he didn\u2019t give her the words, his touch was enough. When at last he found the strength, he rolled to his side and gathered her into his arms. He kissed the top of her head and lay back. She rested her cheek on his shoulder and put her hand over his heart.</p><p>She loved this man.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN</p><p>G ABRIELLE HAD NOT KNOWN SUCH EXQUISITE PLEASURE was possible.</p><p>Content to stay in his arms, her hand still rested on his chest over his heart as she stared across the room at the dying embers. She thought he was asleep and tried to pull the covers up, but Colm tightened his hold on her. She snuggled closer, sighed, and closed her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cColm?\u201d</p><p>He yawned. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you hit Liam? Do you remember hitting him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember. He couldn\u2019t walk any farther, and he would have felt disgraced if he were carried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnocking your poor brother senseless was an act of kindness then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could think so.\u201d</p><p>Her mind floated from one thought to another. She was quiet for several minutes and then asked, \u201cDid you love Joan when you were betrothed to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He obviously didn\u2019t feel any further explanation was necessary.</p><p>Another minute passed and then she whispered, \u201cMore salt is coming. I forgot to tell you, but you will have enough to fill your storeroom when the last trunks are brought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a good gift,\u201d he said. \u201cSalt has more value than gold here.\u201d</p><p>She jumped to another question almost immediately. \u201cThose two men who were caught sneaking into the abbey to kill Liam...were they also sent by MacKenna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Evidently they were new recruits. MacKenna appears to have hired every degenerate character he came across.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not sorry my guards killed them.\u201d</p><p>He smiled in the darkness. She sounded fierce. \u201cGo to sleep, Gabrielle. You need your rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me what happened to the men who beat Liam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one last question, if you please. My mother\u2019s statue of St. Biel will be moved from the courtyard at Wellingshire and brought here. It\u2019s a tradition. Will you mind? It\u2019s quite large.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not mind unless you plan to put a statue in our bed. Now sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I kiss you good night?\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize how you tempt me? You are tender now. You should sleep.\u201d</p><p>Even as he was telling her what she should do, he was rolling her onto her back and kissing the side of her neck. He was not gentle with her this second time. Already discovering what she liked, his lovemaking was less restrained. She wrapped her legs around him as he drove deep inside her. He groaned, and when he began to move his hips, she cried out in blissful rapture. She found fulfillment first and his release followed. It was even better this second time.</p><p>Exhausted and sated, she closed her eyes. Colm lifted up on his elbows and looked down at her. \u201cNow you will sleep,\u201d he commanded. He rolled onto his side and pulled her up against him so that her back was pressed against his chest.</p><p>She was of a mind to obey.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT</p><p>E VER SINCE THE REVELATIONS AT NEWELL CASTLE, COSWOLD\u2019S life had been miserable.</p><p>The baron was sick and tired of pretending humility with the king, but he knew he was on shaky ground. John was still furious that Coswold and the others had believed Isla, that lying bitch. When Coswold dared to point out that it was Percy who had duped Isla into telling the lies about Lady Gabrielle, the king reminded him that Isla was Coswold\u2019s own niece, and he was therefore responsible for her actions. Besides, John had already taken his displeasure out on Percy. The scoundrel had been stripped of his title and his small estate and was sent to a dungeon where he could ponder his transgressions. And just to make sure that Isla learned her lesson as well, the king thought it appropriate that she accompany Percy. Perhaps the two of them would think better of conspiring against the king\u2019s wishes if they were forced to spend all their time together.</p><p>Coswold knew it was imperative to get John to forgive him. The king had a terrible temper and would assuredly blame Coswold for any trouble that might follow. He did everything in his power to please the king. Coswold followed John wherever he went and was at his beck and call day and night. He would have rolled over like a dog if he\u2019d been told to. As a result of these exhausting efforts, John was softening his attitude. He liked having a confidant he could regale with stories about the barons\u2019 wives he had slept with.</p><p>As humiliating as it was to grovel, Coswold\u2019s newfound closeness to the king certainly had its benefits. He was present when a messenger arrived to give the king the good news. The rumor had been verified: Lady Gabrielle had been found. She had been taken in by the MacHugh clan and was living among the Highlanders in their mountain stronghold. John was elated. Now he could set about making amends with the lady and perhaps head off some of the animosity from Baron Geoffrey and the other barons.</p><p>Before John dispatched his envoy to the MacHugh holding to make his announcement to Gabrielle, he called the man to him to give specific instructions. Coswold stood by and listened. The king informed Coswold that he had chosen this particular herald because he had a flawless memory and could repeat any message to the exact word. After expressing his admiration for the king\u2019s good judgment, Coswold reminded him that he had just returned from that part of the Highlands. Perhaps he could offer some advice.</p><p>\u201cThe way to the MacHugh clan is dangerous. The Highlanders are sometimes hostile to outsiders,\u201d Coswold said. \u201cMay I suggest that your herald stop at Arbane Abbey and get an escort to accompany him the rest of the way? The monks will be accommodating if there is a reward.\u201d</p><p>He saw that the king was angered at this suggestion and Coswold hastily added, \u201cAnd I, to show my goodwill, shall be happy to supply whatever you feel is needed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will supply me with double your tax, Coswold, and then I will be appeased,\u201d the king said. \u201cGive the monks whatever you want. I don\u2019t care about them, but I do want my herald to have safe passage.\u201d</p><p>Coswold filled a cart with a dozen casks of the finest wine he could buy and sent it to the abbey ahead of the envoy. He then requested that the king allow him to return to his home to get an accounting of the crop that had just been harvested. The king gave his approval.</p><p>As quickly as possible, Coswold gathered his men and headed to Arbane Abbey. Having selected only well-trained soldiers to accompany him, he was surrounded by a small but capable army. He wasn\u2019t about to take any chances. Men frequently disappeared in the wilds of the Highlands and were never seen again. Coswold was still waiting to hear from the men he had sent to verify Gabrielle\u2019s whereabouts. He had suspicions that they had stolen the trunks for themselves and hadn\u2019t gone to the MacHugh holding at all.</p><p>THE MONKS of Arbane Abbey had just settled in for their evening prayers when a loud pounding noise at the front gate interrupted them. The abbot hurriedly genuflected in the chapel and rushed across the courtyard to the gate, irritated by the inconvenience.</p><p>It was too soon for the monks who had traveled to the MacHugh holding to be returning. Their journey home would take longer than usual because of the bishop. He had been visiting the abbey when the envoy from England arrived, and hearing about the message that was being delivered to Lady Gabrielle, the bishop had insisted on accompanying the group, explaining that he seldom had the opportunity to be present when good news arrived from the English king. The monks were to take an alternate route home to deposit the bishop at his residence, which added an additional two hours to their journey. It was impossible for them to have traveled so swiftly that they would have arrived already.</p><p>The abbot slid the bolt back and opened the gate a crack. Seeing who it was, he swung the gate wide. \u201cWhat brings you back to Arbane Abbey?\u201d he asked in surprise.</p><p>Baron Coswold walked past the abbot and entered the courtyard, followed by one of his subordinates, Cyril. He turned to him and gave orders that his troops were to make camp outside the monastery walls. Only then did Coswold address the perplexed abbot. \u201cI come on behalf of King John,\u201d he announced.</p><p>\u201cFor what purpose?\u201d the abbot asked.</p><p>Coswold had his explanation ready. \u201cThe king has sent one of his heralds as an envoy to deliver a message to the MacHugh holding. I have received word from travelers that there is great turmoil in the Highlands,\u201d he lied, \u201cand fearing for the envoy\u2019s life, and knowing how important his mission is to the king, I have taken it upon myself to gather my army to assure the king\u2019s envoy safe passage.\u201d</p><p>Coswold did not realize the truth of his statement about turmoil, for he had yet to hear of MacKenna\u2019s demise.</p><p>The abbot showed the baron into the hall. \u201cI am certain the envoy will return safely, Baron, but you are welcome to wait here and see for yourself. I will have the cook bring you food and drink. If there is anything else I can do to make you comfortable, I am your humble servant.\u201d</p><p>The abbot hurried off to make arrangements for the unexpected guest.</p><p>When the travel-weary group returned to the abbey after nightfall, Coswold was waiting to greet them.</p><p>The envoy was surprised to see the baron. \u201cDid the king send you here with further instructions for me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Coswold answered. He pulled a chair from the table and offered it to the envoy. \u201cThe king relies on you and knows as I do how important your duties are. Your safety is important to him...and since there is nothing I care about more than the king\u2019s contentment, I felt it my obligation to see to your well-being.\u201d</p><p>With an ingratiating smile, he pointed to the chair. \u201cSit with me and we will drink some wine and eat some cheese, and you can tell me all about your adventure. Are the MacHughs as savage and ill-tempered as I have heard? And what of Lady Gabrielle? Is she as beautiful as I remember?\u201d</p><p>The envoy was flattered by the baron\u2019s attention and eager to share his experience. After a second goblet of wine, he was completely relaxed and the words flowed freely.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to tell you word for word what each said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, not at all,\u201d Coswold said. \u201cSave your report for the king. I\u2019m only interested to know what those people are like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not be giving the king each word I heard. He only wants to know if Lady Gabrielle accepted his forgiveness and his offer of Finney\u2019s Flat.\u201d</p><p>He took a gulp of wine while Coswold waited impatiently.</p><p>\u201cNow to answer your question, it is true. Lady MacHugh is a beauty,\u201d he said. \u201cShe seems content as well. Her new clan was happy to hear that Finney\u2019s Flat now belongs to their laird. They are\u2014\u201d</p><p>Coswold interrupted. \u201cLady MacHugh? You mean to say Lady Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is Lady MacHugh now, for she is married to Laird MacHugh. I must tell you, I was quaking in my boots when he turned his gaze on me. He is a fierce warrior.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The envoy accepted more wine and continued to talk about his impressions of the MacHugh laird. He didn\u2019t notice Coswold\u2019s distress.</p><p>While he chatted amicably about the wedded couple, Coswold stared straight ahead, gripping his goblet so tightly the rim began to bend from the pressure. His throat burned with the bile rising from his stomach. It took all his control not to scream his fury. Too late. It was too late. Gabrielle had once again eluded his grasp. Was the treasure lost to him as well?</p><p>Whenever the envoy paused, Coswold nodded encouragement and refilled his goblet. After so much wine, the envoy\u2019s words began to slur, and his eyelids grew heavy. \u201cI am sleepy,\u201d he said and started to rise.</p><p>Coswold hurriedly offered him more cheese and bread. \u201cYou will sleep better on a full stomach,\u201d he said, smiling broadly when the envoy reached for the food.</p> <p>\u201cWhat other news did you hear?\u201d Coswold asked. \u201cThe MacHughs are such a curious group of people. I find them fascinating,\u201d he added so that the envoy would not discern a deeper motive. By morning, he doubted the drunken man would remember anything he\u2019d said.</p><p>\u201cWhile I was waiting for Lady MacHugh to come back outside, I ate a variety of interesting foods. There was a sweetbread I much enjoyed...\u201d</p><p>Coswold let him ramble, hoping he would hear something of interest.</p><p>\u201cThey were celebrating,\u201d the envoy said, yawning. A piece of cheese was stuck between his teeth, and Coswold looked away. The drunkard\u2019s behavior was becoming more and more disgusting.</p><p>\u201cCelebrating what?\u201d he asked, unable to keep the irritation out of his voice.</p> <p>\u201cFinney\u2019s...\u201d He seemed to have lost his train of thought.</p><p>\u201cThey were celebrating the news that Finney\u2019s Flat is now theirs?\u201d Coswold prodded.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes. It belongs to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas there mention of anything else their laird would receive?\u201d</p><p>The envoy blinked several times, trying to focus. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGold,\u201d Coswold muttered. \u201cWas there mention of gold?\u201d</p> <p>The envoy scratched his chin. \u201cNo, no gold.\u201d</p><p>Despair was drowning Coswold, and he slumped into the chair and buried his face in his hand. \u201cLost,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He thought the envoy had fallen asleep, but he was mistaken.</p><p>\u201cTreasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat say you?\u201d Coswold asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cSt. Biel. There is treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know about the treasure?\u201d he demanded. He shook the envoy to get him alert enough to continue.</p><p>\u201cThe priest...he said they will get the treasure...\u201d he mumbled.</p> <p>Coswold leaned closer to the man so that he could hear each word. \u201cDid anyone say where this treasure is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo...Lady MacHugh...Lady MacHugh said...\u201d</p><p>Coswold grabbed the man\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWhat did Lady MacHugh say about the treasure?\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s head rolled to the side. \u201cShe said the laird gets the land...but he will not have the treasure.\u201d</p><p>Coswold dropped the man\u2019s shoulders and stood back. Perhaps it was not too late after all.</p><p>CHAPTER FORTY-NINE</p><p>C OLM WAS A POSSESSIVE MAN. HE KEPT A WATCHFUL EYE on Gabrielle and found that he didn\u2019t like any man standing too close to her or staring overly long.</p><p>In the days since their marriage, he hadn\u2019t relaxed his guard. One evening after supper, Liam and Colm were alone in the great hall. While Willa and Maurna cleared the table, Liam decided to bring up his brother\u2019s intense watchfulness.</p><p>\u201cCome and stand by the fire, Colm, so that I may speak to you in private.\u201d</p><p>Liam knelt on one knee and tossed a fat log into the fire, then pulled a chair closer to the heat and sat down.</p><p>Colm leaned against the hearth and waited to hear what his brother had to say.</p><p>\u201cDo you have reason to distrust Gabrielle?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>The question offended Colm, but he knew Liam wasn\u2019t trying to insult him or Gabrielle. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Liam nodded. \u201cYou are right to trust her. She would never be untrue to you. I see where her heart belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where might that be?\u201d</p><p>His brother laughed. \u201cYou cannot be that blind. You know she loves you.\u201d</p><p>Colm didn\u2019t acknowledge Liam\u2019s words. Love was for women to talk about, not warriors.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you ask me if I distrusted her when you already held the answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the way you act. You behave like a jealous man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not jealous. I guard what is mine. Gabrielle deserves as much protection as any other member of my clan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is your wife, Colm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I will guard her well.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle caught their attention when she appeared on the stairs. She stepped to the side and waited while two of Colm\u2019s men carried up her trunk.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, why are you taking salt to your room?\u201d</p><p>As the men passed her she told them, \u201cPut it across the hearth in my chamber, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show them where it should go,\u201d Maurna called out as she hurried to help. \u201cBut milady, why is it you want a trunk of salt in your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t salt,\u201d she explained to Maurna. And then to Colm and Liam she said, \u201cIf you\u2019ll remember, Colm, I told you that all but one of the trunks were filled with salt. It took forever to find the right trunk, and as luck would have it, it was on the bottom of the stack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will wear the MacHugh colors. You have no need of English clothes,\u201d he answered.</p><p>\u201cI may not need them, but I\u2019m still going to keep them. There are other things in the trunk as well, reminders and memories of Wellingshire and St. Biel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, Gabrielle, you\u2019ve got enough reminders of St. Biel,\u201d Liam said. \u201cColm, did you see the size of the statue the abbot sent? It\u2019s in the storage room until you build Gelroy a chapel. Then it will go inside the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Liam,\u201d Gabrielle said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t go inside. It stays outside by the door so that all will see it as they go in. It is tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of the statues in St. Biel are inside churches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. We pray to God, not to statues.\u201d</p><p>Liam had stood when she entered the room, but once she was seated, he returned to his chair.</p><p>\u201cIs it true that another statue is coming from your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. It belonged to my mother, and now that I am married it will come to me. It\u2019s tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny others on their way here?\u201d Colm drawled.</p><p>\u201cJust a dozen or so,\u201d she teased.</p><p>She was laughing at their reaction when her guards requested to speak to her. She took one look at her faithful guards\u2019 serious faces and knew immediately what they were going to tell her: they were going home.</p><p>Gabrielle took a deep breath and desperately tried to hold back the tears. It would be wrong for her to cry. She glanced at Colm and could tell from his expression that the guards had already spoken to him. She slowly walked over to them and folded her hands as though in prayer.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going home.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Stephen as she made the statement.</p><p>\u201cIt is time, Princess. We are now convinced that your laird will keep you safe.\u201d</p><p>She took his hand in hers and said, \u201cYou have been my truest friend, Stephen. I do not know how I will ever go on without you.\u201d</p><p>He bowed to her and stepped back. Gabrielle clasped Lucien\u2019s hand next. \u201cWe have had many misadventures together, have we not? I think you will be happy to be rid of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNay, I will not, Princess. I will miss you, but I will always carry you in my heart.\u201d</p><p>Faust was next in line. She took his hand and said, \u201cCan you believe it, Faust? You will soon see St. Biel\u2019s mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall miss you, Princess.\u201d</p><p>Christien was last. She touched his hand and said, \u201cYou have saved me from death too many times to count. I owe you my life, Christien, and I will miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not have to miss me long, Princess. I will be back. I will know when it is time.\u201d</p><p>They bowed low and took their leave. A single tear trickled down her cheek. Without a word, Gabrielle left the hall and went up to her room.</p><p>Colm knew she needed to be alone. He waited as long as he could, and then he went to her chamber. She was curled up on the bed, weeping. He gathered her in his arms and comforted her the only way he knew. He let her cry.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTY</p><p>F ATHER GELROY HELPED HER DEAL WITH HER LOSS BY making her feel guilty.</p><p>\u201cOf course you miss your guards. They\u2019ve been like older brothers to you all these years, but you\u2019ve got to think about them finding their own path. St. Biel is their home, and you should have joy in your heart that they can now return to their lives there.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle knew the holy man was right, but it was still difficult for her to find joy when she missed them so much. Fortunately, she was kept busy and had little time to mope.</p><p>The clan made it easy for her to settle into their way of life. Gabrielle had won them over when they heard that she had killed a man to keep Liam safe. She earned their love and respect when she married their laird and gave him Finney\u2019s Flat. Standing up to Lady Joan and putting her in her place showed them that she had a temper, which they considered a fine trait.</p><p>Everyone took turns instructing her. Maurna and Willa helped her learn how to be mistress in her home. It was up to Gabrielle to decide the menu for each meal, when the rushes needed to be changed and the bedding aired out, and a thousand other things that made the castle run smoothly.</p><p>Neither the housekeeper nor the cook ever said \u201cno\u201d to her or came right out and told her she was wrong about anything. They had a more subtle way to let her know when they felt she\u2019d made a mistake.</p><p>\u201cWe shall have meat pies for dinner tonight,\u201d Gabrielle told Willa.</p><p>The cook shook her head ever so slightly. Gabrielle tried again. \u201cWe will have chicken?\u201d</p><p>Another quick shake of the head followed that order. Gabrielle sighed. \u201cMutton then.\u201d</p><p>A nod of approval. \u201cYes, Lady MacHugh. Mutton it will be.\u201d</p><p>The stonecutter and the candlemaker instructed her in the goings on with the various clans. They felt it was imperative that their mistress understand all the feuds.</p><p>Gabrielle wasn\u2019t even sure where all the clans lived.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it important for me to know about the feuds?\u201d she asked.</p><p>The candlemaker looked astonished that she would ask such a question. He answered with one of his own. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know who\u2019s fighting, how will you know who to speak to and who to curse?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have a ready answer for him.</p><p>That evening as she prepared for bed, she asked Colm about the clans. \u201cThere are so many of them in the Highlands, I cannot keep them straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow I will draw you a map and show you where each clan lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you draw this map before or after you take me to the Buchanans?\u201d</p><p>She stepped out of the light while she removed her undergarments and put on her nightgown. Her shyness amused Colm. He was already in bed. He lay on his side and, leaning on his elbow, propped his head up and lazily watched her.</p><p>Gabrielle moved back to the fire to warm herself while she brushed the tangles from her hair.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you put that gown on?\u201d Colm asked. \u201cI\u2019m only going to take it off as soon as you come to bed.\u201d</p><p>She put the brush down and turned to him. \u201cI must pay a visit to the Buchanans. Will you take me tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Gillian is my dearest cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never even met the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is still dear to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have duties tomorrow. I cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould someone else take me to the Buchanans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day after tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Come to bed.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him a long minute. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem fazed by her refusal. She was disappointed, for she hoped to make him angry. She would have stormed out of the room, but she didn\u2019t have anywhere to go. Besides, she couldn\u2019t storm anywhere unless she got dressed. Gabrielle decided there was too much effort required just to irritate him.</p><p>It only took a few more seconds for her to admit to herself that she was going to have to get into bed or she would freeze to death. She crossed the room to the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cJust so you understand. I\u2019m not coming to you. I\u2019m coming to bed.\u201d</p><p>She started to climb over him to her side of the bed, but with one movement he pulled her gown over her head and she landed hard on his chest. He pushed her legs down, trapping them with his, and then rolled over so that she was pinned beneath him.</p><p>He nibbled her neck as he said, \u201cJust so you understand. I\u2019m going to make love to you.\u201d</p><p>He had the last word.</p><p>GABRIELLE WAS WALKING to the lake with Braeden\u2019s wife, Lily, who was large with their first child. She wasn\u2019t so much timid as shy, and she spoke in a voice barely above a whisper. She was a sweet-tempered woman, and Gabrielle enjoyed her companionship.</p><p>\u201cIs this the lake the men swim in?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cOn the far side where we can\u2019t see them. They wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d Lily said, \u201cbut they know we would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it a beautiful day? The air is so crisp.\u201d Gabrielle stretched her arms out and let the sun warm her face.</p><p>\u201cWait until you see the lake. It\u2019s clear water,\u201d Lily said. \u201cFreezing to the touch, though. Even in the summer months the water never warms. Just dangling your feet in it will cause your teeth to chatter. I do not know how the men stand it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you for warning me. I will be certain never to test it.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle sat under a tree enjoying this peaceful time of day. The noon meal was finished, but there were still a few hours before supper.</p><p>Lily talked about the preparations she was making for the baby, and Gabrielle was about to ask her a question when Ethan and Tom came charging through the trees. Tom was chasing Ethan.</p><p>\u201cThey should not be here alone,\u201d Lily said.</p><p>Gabrielle agreed. She called to the boys. Ethan was trying to outrun Tom, but he couldn\u2019t change direction in time. She watched him trip over his own feet and propel himself into the water.</p><p>Lily shouted for help as Gabrielle kicked off her shoes and ran in after the child. The water was so cold she feared her heart would stop. With Tom on the bank wailing, she fished Ethan to the surface and carried him to dry land sputtering and coughing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d he told Tom when he could get his breath.</p><p>\u201cLady Gabrielle, could I try\u2014\u201d Tom began.</p><p>She knew where he was heading. \u201cNo, you may not try the water. Both of you, come with me.\u201d</p><p>Lily wrapped her shawl around Ethan. \u201cYou\u2019ll be sneezing tonight,\u201d she predicted.</p> <p>Gabrielle\u2019s teeth chattered. \u201cSnow isn\u2019t as cold as that water,\u201d she said.</p><p>Lily nodded. \u201cThe boys\u2019 aunt lives just two cottages away from mine. I will see them home. You should go change your clothes before you start sneezing.\u201d</p><p>Fortunately, neither Colm nor Liam were inside the castle, and she was able to get to her room without being noticed. Unfortunately, little Ethan and Tom told everyone they saw about Lady MacHugh jumping into the water. By the time Gabrielle had changed her clothes and warmed herself by the fire, the entire clan knew she\u2019d gone swimming in the lake.</p><p>Willa and Maurna pounded on her door. \u201cAre you wanting more blankets, milady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she assured them. \u201cBut I do want directions to the twins\u2019 home. I would like to talk to their aunt.\u201d</p> <p>Willa showed her the way. When the door was answered, Gabrielle understood why the boys were allowed to run wild. The aunt was quite elderly and looked in need of a yearlong nap.</p><p>Gabrielle was invited inside. Ethan was looking no worse for wear. Both he and Tom sat at the table eating what appeared to be the same vile paste Willa was always trying to get Gabrielle to eat. The boys seemed to like it, though.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be staying inside until tomorrow,\u201d the aunt promised. \u201cEthan, remember your manners. Thank Lady MacHugh for saving you from death. Apologize to her for her trouble.\u201d</p><p>The apology was given and accepted. The aunt ushered Gabrielle outside and closed the door so the boys wouldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, milady. Ethan and Tom are good boys. I\u2019ve had them since their parents died. It hasn\u2019t been easy. I\u2019ve tried my best, and everyone in the clan has helped out, but they need more than I can give them.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle took the old woman\u2019s hand in hers. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to the laird,\u201d she promised. \u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll think of something.\u201d</p> <p>On her return to the castle, Gabrielle felt pangs of guilt. After her complaints to Colm about taking on too much responsibility and never delegating, here she was giving him yet another problem to solve.</p><p>She was waiting at the table when Colm and Liam walked into the great hall. From Colm\u2019s frown and Liam\u2019s grin, she assumed they had already heard about the incident at the lake.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy your swim?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t in the mood for merriment. Glaring at Colm, she said, \u201cDid you forget to ban them from the lake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I had,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>His concern calmed her down. \u201cThat boy nearly drowned. Something has to be done.\u201d She went to him and kissed his cheek. \u201cYou will take them in hand? They will not live to be six if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Willa carried supper to the table. Gabrielle had already eaten, but she sat by Colm while he and Liam ate.</p><p>\u201cDo you know that after I fished Ethan out, Tom wanted to take a turn?\u201d</p> <p>Liam choked on the drink of water he had just taken. Gabrielle waited until he stopped coughing and then asked him how old he thought the aunt was.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be unkind, but she looked to be at least eighty,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cActually, she\u2019s about your age,\u201d Liam said. \u201cThat\u2019s what three years with those boys will do.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cThat\u2019s not amusing.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle turned back to Colm. \u201cShe loves those boys, but they\u2019re too much for her. They have too many people telling them what to do, and so they don\u2019t listen to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Colm nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to the woman.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle was content knowing he would do what was necessary.</p><p>Two days later Gabrielle walked into the great hall carrying a basket of herbs and saw Ethan and Tom running up the stairs. Maurna, standing on the bottom step, watched with apprehension.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they going?\u201d Gabrielle asked.</p><p>\u201cTo your chamber,\u201d Maurna answered.</p><p>Somewhat alarmed, Gabrielle was cautious to ask, \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of your things have been moved to the laird\u2019s chamber. The boys will be living here.\u201d</p><p>Maurna turned toward Gabrielle with a smile that showed she was resigned but also a little frantic.</p><p>\u201cWhat about their aunt?\u201d Gabrielle said.</p><p>\u201cShe will stay in her cottage. She is quite happy about this and said it is best for the boys. They will see her often.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle was about to ask how the boys felt about their new living arrangements, but she heard squeals of laughter from upstairs. She had her answer.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTY-ONE</p><p>I T WAS A GLORIOUS DAY. COLM HAD SURPRISED GABRIELLE AND taken her riding. They made their way to the spot overlooking the beautiful glen and slowed their horses to an easy walk.</p><p>Colm had never before left his duties to spend idle time with her, and Gabrielle was deeply suspicious of his motives.</p><p>\u201cI have no other motive, Gabrielle,\u201d he told her. \u201cI knew you wanted to ride Rogue, and so I decided to accommodate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFaust would usually ride with me...\u201d Her eyes widened in surprise. \u201cYou are being thoughtful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to spend our time talking about why we are riding together, or would you prefer to actually ride?\u201d</p><p>It was lovely having her husband all to herself, but the time slipped away too quickly.</p><p>He talked to her about Ethan and Tom. \u201cThey will be given chores that they can handle, and they may play when the chores are completed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho will give them these chores and see that they are completed?\u201d</p><p>He nudged his horse close so that he was beside her. Reaching over, he pulled her to him. \u201cThe mistress of my home.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her before she could argue. When he lifted his head, he said, \u201cYou did suggest that I delegate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time that we get back,\u201d he said.</p><p>He\u2019d sounded reluctant, she thought, and that pleased her. Perhaps he liked spending time alone with her as much as she did with him.</p><p>They were nearing the drawbridge when a soldier intercepted them.</p><p>\u201cLaird, there is a messenger who says he comes from your wife\u2019s father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father?\u201d Gabrielle cried out.</p><p>Colm reached over and grabbed her reins so that she couldn\u2019t go racing off without him.</p><p>\u201cWhere is this messenger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the base of our mountain. The guards know not to let him come farther without first gaining your permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave him stay there. I will go to him to hear this message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Laird,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle, you will wait inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would prefer to go with you, husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will go inside.\u201d</p><p>She was through being diplomatic. \u201cPerhaps I should explain a different way. I\u2019m going with you. Before you deny me again, I will mention that I know my father\u2019s servants, and I could tell you if this messenger is from Wellingshire or not. Besides,\u201d she rushed on before he could interrupt, \u201cI will still be on your land. You\u2019ve let me ride to the overlook with my guards many times.\u201d</p><p>It was a sound argument, and he decided to change his mind.</p><p>She stayed behind him and slowed when she reached the sharp turn in the trail just above the dividing line between Finney\u2019s Flat and the mountain.</p><p>\u201cColm, what if he brings bad news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we will hear it together.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have time to fret over that possibility, for once she had rounded the tight bend in the trail, she could see the messenger.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Nigel!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cHe is one of my father\u2019s most loyal servants, and I have known him for years.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle nudged Rogue to go faster as she called out a greeting to her father\u2019s steward. Nigel didn\u2019t wait for her to dismount, immediately handing her the scroll in his hands. She knew the missive to be genuine because it bore her father\u2019s seal. She was so excited she could barely contain herself as she read it.</p><p>\u201cMy father comes to see me...see us,\u201d she corrected, \u201cand will be here by the end of the week. This is wonderful news, and I thank you, Nigel, for bringing it to me.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at Colm. \u201cHe will wish to refresh himself. May I offer him your hospitality?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may.\u201d He motioned to one of his guards. \u201cTake him to the kitchens.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Nigel was out of sight, she opened the message and read it to Colm.</p><p>\u201cDaughter, I shall arrive at your new home by week\u2019s end to see for myself that you are safe and well cared for. I have been told that you are married and that you are content. I shall judge for myself once I have met your husband and looked into your eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was told what you had endured at the abbey, I was enraged. I frantically searched for you. Word came from Laird Buchanan that you were safe and protected. My relief was great, Daughter, but my rage remained. I called up my vassals to prepare for war. Other barons joined me. The king has tried to make right the wrong Coswold and Percy have done, but I will not rest until both have paid for their sins.\u201d</p><p>There were tears of joy in Gabrielle\u2019s eyes when she looked at Colm. \u201cMy father is coming. This is happy news.\u201d</p><p>Colm lifted her onto Rogue\u2019s back. \u201cIf it makes you smile like that, then yes, it is happy news.\u201d</p><p>He handed her the reins and swung onto his mount.</p><p>\u201cOh, wait,\u201d Gabrielle said, unrolling the scroll again. \u201cThere\u2019s more to read.\u201d She studied the paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI will see you soon,\u201d she read. \u201cAnd please take my daughter to visit her dearest cousin at the Buchanans with all possible haste.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn back to see his reaction as she rode away from him.</p><p>Colm followed, his laugh echoing across the valley.</p><p>ON MONDAY Braeden rode with Gabrielle to the bottom of the mountain to see if her father had started across Finney\u2019s Flat.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the messenger give you the news just yesterday?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, he did, Braeden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd didn\u2019t your father say he would be here at the end of the week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did, but my father often misjudges the time it takes to travel. He could be riding very fast,\u201d she explained.</p><p>Braeden could see her excitement. He didn\u2019t want to disillusion her with practicality, and so he said nothing more about the matter as they made the trip down the mountain.</p><p>Tuesday morning Colm left to attend a meeting. Laird Ramsey Sinclair had called on all the lairds to gather at his holding to discuss the recent events in the Highlands. There had been much unrest among the clans since the murder of Laird Monroe and the hostility provoked by Laird MacKenna. The Monroes were now undergoing a power struggle between two of the laird\u2019s nephews, and the MacKennas were left with no leader at all. Before things got out of hand, the lairds would meet at this summit and decide on a common course of action.</p><p>Colm could not say how long he would be away, but he assured Gabrielle that he would return in plenty of time to meet her father.</p><p>\u201cWhy must I always have an escort to look at the flats?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m staying on our land. I\u2019m perfectly safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be perfectly safe with an escort.\u201d</p><p>Tuesday afternoon she nagged Michael into riding with her. She came back two hours later.</p><p>Wednesday she coerced James. She returned in one hour.</p><p>Thursday Philip escorted her. It was raining, and she didn\u2019t get back for three hours.</p><p>Friday Michael rode with her again.</p><p>She didn\u2019t come back at all.</p><p>GABRIELLE HAD VANISHED. It happened at the sharp turn near the base of the mountain. Michael was riding ahead of her, and for no more than fifteen or twenty seconds Gabrielle was alone. But that was all the time they needed.</p><p>Michael thought she was right behind him. He could hear Rogue\u2019s hooves clipping over the stones. He knew his mistress had slowed the horse as was her habit just before she reached the turn. On one side was a drop with loose rocks. Rogue could lose his footing if he stepped too close. On the other was a cliff. Thorny scrub trees grew from it at perpendicular angles, like crooked tentacles reaching over the path. The thicket was so dense it muffled sound.</p><p>Gabrielle and the guard had been chatting amicably.</p><p>\u201cI think the laird is going to widen this trail,\u201d he told her, \u201cso you won\u2019t have to worry about your horse slipping.\u201d</p><p>Expecting a reply, he casually glanced over his shoulder. Rogue was still behind him, but Gabrielle was gone. He shouted to her and leaped from his mount. \u201cLady MacHugh?\u201d</p><p>No answer. Thinking she had fallen, he shouted again as he ran back to the turn. \u201cAre you hurt? Lady MacHugh, where are you?\u201d</p><p>And still there was no answer. Michael bellowed to the sentry on the far ridge. \u201cDid you see her? Our mistress...\u201d</p><p>The soldier couldn\u2019t hear him, but the two sentries patrolling on the hill behind him did hear and sounded the alarm. The shouting spooked Rogue, and the skittish animal turned and bolted up the hill.</p><p>Frantic, Michael slid down the drop a ways to see if his mistress had taken a tumble. She wasn\u2019t there. Climbing back up, he then used his sword to hack some of the brush away, clinging to the hope that his mistress had somehow gotten stuck in the thorns and would soon be calling to him for help.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here. She\u2019s not here,\u201d he screamed, panic making his voice crack.</p><p>Within minutes the area was swarming with MacHugh soldiers, all searching for Gabrielle. Liam and Braeden, expert trackers, each took a section of the trail to look for footprints.</p><p>Michael had trampled most of the trail and cut through a great deal of the brush, so there was little evidence of where and how someone had gotten to Gabrielle. Liam walked farther down the slope where the trail leveled. He veered off the beaten path to the left where the ground was more dirt than rock. He walked a good distance. When he looked back, he could no longer see the trail.</p><p>\u201cBraeden!\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>Braeden, who had been searching the other side of the drop, came running.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say at least fifteen men,\u201d Liam estimated. He looked down at the soft ground that had been trampled by footprints and horseprints. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think more,\u201d Braeden said.</p><p>Liam walked back. Footprints angled off toward the thicket that reached all the way to the cliff. \u201cIt looks like a couple of them split off here.\u201d</p><p>Braeden followed him as he traced the broken and cut branches. When they reached the cliff overlooking the turn in the path, Liam stopped. \u201cThis is where they hid,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were waiting for her to pass beneath them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Braeden said as he reached down and pulled something from a thorny twig. He raised a shred of green fabric in his fingertips. \u201cLady Gabrielle was wearing a green dress today.\u201d He looked bleakly at Liam. \u201cI\u2019ll organize the men to search for these bastards. You take two soldiers and ride hard to Laird Sinclair\u2019s holding to give Colm this grim news.\u201d</p> <p>Liam nodded. It was a duty he dreaded more than death.</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO</p><p>G ABRIELLE AWOKE WITH A POUNDING HEADACHE. SHE opened her eyes and tried to understand what was happening to her. She looked around a room that was unfamiliar, as was the bed she rested on. The ceiling was low, close enough for her to touch if she sat up. She was in some sort of loft. The smell in the air was musty and stale. Whatever this building was, it had not been used in a good long while. Sticks of straw poked her back, and the cover someone had thrown on her was rough against her face. She felt a sting on her cheek and reached up to touch it. When she lowered her hand, there was a trace of blood on her fingers. She then saw the scratches on her arm.</p><p>The fog slowly cleared from her mind. Rogue. She had been riding Rogue. And there was an animal. No, no. She thought the noise she heard was an animal foraging for food. There was a rustling sound. Then came a blinding pain.</p><p>Below, a door squeaked open, and she heard the shuffle of people filing inside. Gabrielle was suddenly wide awake. She wanted to crawl to the edge of the loft and look over, but was afraid she would be seen or heard.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t tell how many were underneath her until she heard their voices.</p><p>\u201cYou better hope she wakes up, Leod, \u2019cause if she don\u2019t, he\u2019s goin\u2019 to kill you and bury you on top of her. I ain\u2019t never seen anyone act like that. Did you see the crazed gleam in his eyes? It was like the devil was starin\u2019 out at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only did what I was told to do,\u201d Leod protested. \u201cYou heard what he said. Put her down quick before she can scream and then hand her off to you so you can carry her, and that\u2019s what I did, Kenny. I put her down. I don\u2019t care how mad he gets, we got stuck doin\u2019 all the work. While the rest of them are waitin\u2019 off to the east, we\u2019re crawlin\u2019 up the side of the cliff, tryin\u2019 not to make a sound while we push through that thicket. Waitin\u2019 on our bellies for hours and hours without movin\u2019 at all. The skin\u2019s torn off my hands and arms from the thorns. My legs are crampin\u2019, too. He shouldn\u2019t be yellin\u2019 at me or you \u2019cause we did the work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know we did, but you shouldn\u2019t have used your sling to get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what I use to get my birds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA woman ain\u2019t the same as a bird, Leod. Besides, you break your birds\u2019 necks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only way I know to kill them and keep the fat on them for cookin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have broken her neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used a small stone so I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure hope she wakes up. Does my face look bloody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does. We should\u2019ve had more help,\u201d he whined.</p><p>\u201cWe had Andrew right behind us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat good was he? He\u2019s so small and scrawny, he looks like he\u2019s ten, and he can\u2019t lift anything heavier than a bucket. He should have sent another man with us, not a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis looks are deceiving. He\u2019s near as old as we are. He just looks young and puny, but I hear he\u2019s killed more than his share, and I\u2019m meanin\u2019 people, not birds. He uses his knife on them. Strolls up lookin\u2019 so innocent and bam! in slides his blade.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you ever see him do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I heard others talkin\u2019 about it. I\u2019d run fast if Andrew comes smilin\u2019 at me. You best go on up the ladder now and see if she\u2019s breathin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle heard the sound of the ladder being dragged across the floor. The top slammed against the loft.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think this can hold me,\u201d Leod balked. \u201cGet that kid. Make him do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. Andrew ain\u2019t no kid, and if he goes up, he\u2019ll diddle with her before he comes down.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle closed her eyes, trying to still her pounding heart. She heard boots on the rungs of the ladder, and she lay perfectly still as the man came near her. He smelled foul.</p><p>He bumped his head on the sloped ceiling. The straw mattress shifted when he leaned over her. He put his hand on her chest, and while she pretended to be unconscious, his fingers moved across her breasts. She wanted to kill him.</p><p>He jerked his hand away when Kenny yelled at him. \u201cIs she breathing or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is, but she\u2019s still sleepin\u2019.\u201d He shook her. \u201cShe won\u2019t open her eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen get down here. I hear him comin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Leod muttered a curse as he climbed down.</p><p>\u201cLeave the ladder where it is. He\u2019ll want to see her.\u201d</p><p>The door opened again, and the person they were waiting for entered. She didn\u2019t need to see his face to know who he was. As soon as he opened his mouth, she knew: Baron Coswold.</p><p>Gabrielle went from stunned disbelief to rage in less than a heartbeat. Why was Coswold here? What did he want from her now? But there was no time to try and understand his motives. Instead, she needed to find a way to escape.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain she sleeps?\u201d Coswold demanded, and before Leod or Kenny could answer, he said, \u201cHow long have you been here? Were you talking? Did you say anything she might have heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just came inside, didn\u2019t we, Kenny?\u201d Leod said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have time to talk. I walked in, got the ladder, and climbed to see if she was breathin\u2019 and if her eyes were open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s alive,\u201d Kenny said.</p><p>\u201cBut she ain\u2019t awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBring her down here,\u201d Coswold ordered.</p><p>\u201cBut she ain\u2019t awake yet,\u201d Kenny reminded.</p><p>Gabrielle heard a scuffle, then \u201cI\u2019m gettin\u2019 her. I\u2019m gettin\u2019 her for you.\u201d</p><p>The man climbed into the loft again and lifted Gabrielle off the bed. He carried her to the edge and dropped her limp body into waiting arms.</p><p>\u201cPull the chair out and put her there. Leod, get rope and tie her.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle continued to feign sleep while she was pushed and prodded. Her head hung down, and her hair covered her face. She knew Coswold stood over her. She felt his beady eyes on her, heard his panting, and breathed in his sickeningly sweet perfumed oils.</p><p>Leod wrapped a rope around her waist and pulled the ends tight behind the chair. Then he wound another rope around her wrists and tied it in a double knot.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s good and tied,\u201d he said. He sounded proud of his handiwork. \u201cShe can\u2019t get loose.\u201d</p><p>She felt the knots between her fingers and thought it might be a trick. Surely he knew that she would be able to undo the knots. Was he trying to prove she was awake? Or was he that stupid? She had her answer when he walked away.</p><p>\u201cGet me a cup of water,\u201d Coswold commanded.</p><p>When he had the water in his hand, he said, \u201cGet out. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>Kenny snickered. \u201cHe\u2019s wanting to be alone with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he going to do with her tied to the chair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out and stay out until I call you!\u201d Coswold shouted.</p><p>As soon as the door closed behind the men, Coswold grabbed Gabrielle\u2019s hair and jerked her head back. He threw the water in her face.</p><p>She moaned and slowly opened her eyes. His horrible face was in front of hers.</p><p>\u201cWake up, Gabrielle. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>He deliberately hurt her, using the heel of his hand against her forehead to shove her head against the back of the chair. Then in contradiction he knelt down in front of her and very gently brushed her hair away from her face, stroking her cheek with the backs of his fingers.</p><p>His touch repulsed her.</p><p>He dragged a chair over and sat down facing her. Bracing his hands on his knees, he studied her curiously.</p><p>\u201cI mean you no harm, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond. She saw the maniacal look in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI want to ask you a question. That\u2019s all,\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cWhen you have given me a satisfactory answer, you may go home. Just one question and one answer. You will cooperate, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. He tilted his head and studied her, waiting. Then suddenly he lashed out and slapped her with the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to hear my question?\u201d</p><p>She refused to answer. He struck her again. \u201cWhere is the gold?\u201d</p><p>Before she had time to react, he said, \u201cI want the treasure of St. Biel. Where is it?\u201d</p><p>She braced herself for another attack and said, \u201cThere is no treasure.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t hit her. \u201cYes, there is. I went to St. Biel and became a believer. The king did not send all the gold to the pope. He hid it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that is true, he took the secret to his grave.\u201d</p><p>Coswold wagged his finger at her. \u201cNo, no. The secret has been passed down. Your mother knew, didn\u2019t she? And she told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she couldn\u2019t tell me, because there is no treasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe priest confirmed it. That\u2019s right. The envoy reported that when the priest brought it up, you said you wouldn\u2019t give it to the MacHughs. So you do know where it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he did not mean gold.\u201d</p><p>He struck her again, cutting the corner of her lip. \u201cI don\u2019t think you fully grasp my situation, Gabrielle. The treasure will free me from the king. I have been his pawn for the last time. Even if I could get away from him, I would have no allies. The barons see me as the royal lackey now. If the barons rebel, they will take me down with the king. So you see, I have nothing to lose.\u201d</p><p>She thought he wanted her to feel sorry for him. He was demented.</p><p>\u201cI thought it would be so easy. I would ask for your hand and I would have you. I had heard the tales about hidden treasure, but I didn\u2019t believe them until the king sent me to St. Biel to make certain his steward wasn\u2019t cheating him. I looked at that magnificent palace and saw for myself several gold coins. I was told they were kept as reminders, but that the rest was sent to the pope.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he tapped his head with his fingers. \u201cBut no one could say how much was there to begin with. The more people I asked, the more I was convinced that the king saved most of it for himself. And then I met an old man who had seen it...the gold...stacks and stacks of it. And it just disappeared. Where did it go, Gabrielle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreed has made you unreasonable. I speak the truth. There is no gold,\u201d she said.</p><p>He sighed dramatically. \u201cYes, there is. After all I\u2019ve done...yes, there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot tell you, for I do not know where it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you admit that it exists.\u201d He acted as though he had just tricked her into a confession.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He sat back, crossed one leg over the other and began to lazily swing his foot back and forth.</p><p>A long minute passed in silence. Then her fear turned to terror.</p><p>\u201cDo you love your father?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She gave a sharp cry. \u201cWhere is he? What have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have I done? Nothing yet. Your father doesn\u2019t travel with many men to protect him from ambush. He made it easy for me. I have watched him make his way toward the MacHugh holding. I knew exactly where to attack. Don\u2019t worry. He\u2019s still alive, though his condition is deteriorating. Tell me where the gold is and I will let him live.\u201d</p><p>When she didn\u2019t immediately answer him, Coswold said, \u201cDo you think I might be lying? How did I know Baron Geoffrey was on his way here? It will be easy enough to get proof. I will send some of my men to him. If they cut off his hand and bring it to you, you will see for yourself the ring with his seal still on his finger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she screamed. \u201cYou would not dare kill a baron.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t? Why wouldn\u2019t I? I\u2019ve already killed a laird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonroe? You killed Laird Monroe?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let him have you. I needed to be able to talk to you about the gold. MacKenna didn\u2019t care what I did with you as long as he got Finney\u2019s Flat. Of course, he knew nothing about the treasure. I doubt he would have been so agreeable then. He proved useless to me alive, but now that he is dead, he has been helpful, for we sit inside a crofter\u2019s cottage tucked away on his land. His clan is in such disarray, they have no idea we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband will come for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will have to find you first, and I made certain my men went in every direction to cover their tracks. Are you willing to lose your father and your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me where the gold is and be quick about it. We cannot sit here for days on end. Your husband would indeed find us then, and I would have to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will tell you.\u201d</p><p>His gasp sounded like a snarl. \u201cYes, yes, tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in Wellingshire,\u201d she lied. \u201cAnd well-hidden.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cGold at Wellingshire and your father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother could not tell him. I am the only one who knows. It belongs to the royal family of St. Biel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will have to tell me exactly where it is, for Wellingshire is nearly the size of a small country. Is it hidden in the castle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s buried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he demanded. A wild expression contorted his face, so great was his obsession.</p><p>\u201cI must show you. It\u2019s the only way. As you said, the estate is vast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we will go to Wellingshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf my husband finds out, he will follow us, and I will not let you kill him. You must send him in the opposite direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will I send word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband can read and write.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could write a message telling him that I escaped and now am safe with my father. I would ask him to come for me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe MacKennas,\u201d he said, nodding. \u201cYou will tell your husband they are the ones who took you.\u201d</p><p>By the time Coswold finished telling her what to say, he believed the idea for the message was his. He called to Leod to find something to write with, and it took an hour before the man returned with ink and a piece of parchment.</p><p>Gabrielle wrote exactly what had been decided, but before she signed her name, she looked up at Coswold. \u201cI do not want the messenger killed before he has a chance to give my husband the message. Is there a boy you could send? Not so young that he couldn\u2019t ride and not so old he would be thought a man. My husband would not kill a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Coswold said. \u201cI will get a boy to take the parchment. Now, finish. It is growing dark, but at the first morning light we will be gone.\u201d</p> <p>While Coswold paced about the cottage, Gabrielle added her final words to the message: \u201cPlease come quickly and I will forever do as you say.\u201d</p><p>BY THE TIME Liam got to the Sinclair holding, Colm was on his way home, having taken another route. Liam turned around and headed back, this time on the northern road. He caught up with Colm as he was about to cross Finney\u2019s Flat.</p><p>Colm saw him coming. A sense of dread gripped him.</p><p>\u201cGabrielle,\u201d Liam shouted, \u201cshe is gone! She\u2019s been taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Who took her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe by the time you reach Braeden he will know something.\u201d</p><p>Colm\u2019s rage could not be contained. It blurred his thoughts. \u201cIf any harm comes to her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not think it,\u201d Liam ordered.</p><p>But that was all Colm could think about on the frantic ride home. He could not lose her.</p><p>Night had fallen as he rode up the trail to his holding. He prayed that she had been found and was waiting to greet him. He would tell her then\u2014shout it to the sky\u2014that he loved her. She should have heard the words before. It could not be too late.</p><p>At the ridge one of his sentries shouted to him. \u201cThere...coming across the flat. One rider.\u201d</p> <p>Colm and Liam turned to see a shadow approaching. In the full moon, they could make out the figure of a man on horseback. They rode to meet him, reaching him before he had time to dismount.</p><p>\u201cI bring a message for the laird,\u201d the man said, his voice trembling. He put his hand in his shirt and pulled out the scrolled parchment.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Liam asked.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Andrew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho asked you to bring this to the laird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a MacKenna. I am from the Dunbar clan. I was on my way home from hunting when the man stopped and asked me to bring this to you. He said it was most urgent. I do not know what it says, for I cannot read.\u201d</p><p>Colm grabbed the message from him and read. He handed it to Liam and pointed to the last words. \u201cAs you say\u201d was underlined.</p><p>He ripped the man from the saddle and held him by the neck. His voice was deadly when he said, \u201cWhat my wife tells me is that everything I have just read is a lie. And that means you are lying, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am just the messen\u2014\u201d</p><p>Colm cut off his air, squeezing his neck. He didn\u2019t let up until Andrew\u2019s eyes were bulging out of their sockets. In only minutes, Andrew had told him everything he wanted to know.</p><p>Colm gave Liam the order. \u201cTie him to his horse and bring him. If he lies again, he will pray for death.\u201d</p><p>ANDREW LED THEM to the cottage.</p><p>Colm knew Gabrielle was inside. He had to be cautious. The light from a single candle glowed through the window and he could smell smoke from the chimney. Coswold\u2019s soldiers were bedded down for the night around a campfire south of the cottage, where the grass was soft. Their fire burned low.</p><p>Braeden made his way through the dark to count the number and then returned to Colm. Slowly the MacHugh soldiers circled until the men and the cottage were surrounded. When they were in position, they moved forward. Colm crept up behind the guard in front of the door and killed him before he could make a sound. He lowered the man to the ground, then tested the door. It was bolted against him. He raised his hand to give the signal, and then he kicked the door open and charged inside.</p><p>Coswold had been sleeping in a chair and bolted to his feet at the sound of the door crashing in. He fumbled at his belt for his dagger, but it was too late. He knew he was going to die.</p><p>Leod had been sitting on the edge of the loft with his legs dangling down as Gabrielle sat on the straw mattress behind him.</p><p>\u201cKill her!\u201d Coswold shouted.</p><p>The words weren\u2019t out of his mouth before Gabrielle, using every ounce of strength she had, thrust her whole body at Leod\u2019s back and sent him flying headfirst to the floor. He landed on his face, his neck broken.</p><p>Colm made the kill quickly. He cut Coswold\u2019s throat and tossed the bloody blade to the floor.</p><p>He shouted for his wife and ran to the ladder to reach for her. She fell against him sobbing.</p><p>\u201cI knew you would come.\u201d</p><p>He held her tight and tried to calm his heart. \u201cI would not lose you, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back. \u201cColm, my father,\u201d she cried. \u201cCoswold\u2019s army will kill him. They have...\u201d</p><p>Colm stopped her. \u201cYour father is with the Buchanans this night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are certain?\u201d she asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cYes, Brodick was informed at the summit that your father had arrived. He was too weary to come any farther. You will see him tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her into his arms.</p><p>She laid her head on his shoulder. \u201cTake me home.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE</p><p>GABRIELLE\u2019S FATHER DIDN\u2019T TAKE TO COLM RIGHT AWAY. Nor did Colm particularly like the baron. They were polite, but wary of each other.</p><p>Her father softened his attitude when he saw how Colm treated Gabrielle. It was clear to him that the laird loved her and would cherish her. Colm softened his attitude toward the baron when he saw how much he loved his daughter and how she loved him.</p><p>Willa made a special dinner of roasted pheasant and so many other dishes that Gabrielle lost count. Each time Willa carried a platter to the table, she smiled at Gabrielle.</p><p>Liam strolled in and was introduced to the baron. He said, \u201cDid Gabrielle tell you how she saved my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must hear this story,\u201d the baron said.</p><p>\u201cMilady, if I could borrow you for a moment?\u201d Maurna interrupted.</p><p>Gabrielle excused herself and followed Maurna up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI let Mary go home early tonight,\u201d Maurna said. \u201cShe\u2019s a good help with these two boys, and I thank you for adding her to your household. I thought the twins were down for the night. I came up to look in on them and caught them coming out of the laird\u2019s chamber.\u201d</p><p>Standing at the top of the stairs, Ethan and Tom waited with their heads down.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, milady,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Tom said.</p><p>\u201cTell your mistress what you did,\u201d Maurna said. She was trying to be stern, but Gabrielle heard the tenderness in her voice. She knew the boys could, too.</p><p>\u201cWe just wanted to look in the trunk,\u201d Tom said without lifting his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy trunk?\u201d Gabrielle asked. \u201cWhy would you want to look in there?\u201d</p><p>Ethan lifted his shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but we did.\u201d</p><p>Tom nodded. \u201cI found a statue in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found one, too,\u201d Ethan admitted.</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t break mine. You broke yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys, the statues don\u2019t belong to either of you,\u201d Maurna said.</p><p>Tom took Gabrielle\u2019s hand. \u201cEthan\u2019s sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave them to you, Lady Gabrielle, while I go to your room and see to the damage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it, Maurna. You may go downstairs.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle took the twins into their room and tucked them into bed. She talked to them about respecting privacy and made them promise not to go into their laird\u2019s room again without permission. Then she kissed them good night and closed the door.</p><p>On the way down the corridor, she thought to ask Colm to permanently remove the lid from the trunk. If the boys were to climb in it and the heavy lid were to close, they could be seriously hurt.</p><p>A fire warmed the chamber. The trunk lid was propped open against the wall, and one statue of St. Biel lay half in and half out, hanging dangerously on the edge. The other was on the floor and missing a head.</p><p>She picked up both pieces and moved close to the fire to see if the stone could be repaired. Holding the body at an angle, she noticed something that caught the light. She tipped the statue and examined it more closely. She froze. Gold. The core of the stone piece had been hollowed out and filled with gold. She couldn\u2019t believe what she was seeing. She looked again. The gold was there.</p><p>Gabrielle had to sit down. She went to the bed and put the pieces in her lap.</p><p>The myth wasn\u2019t a myth? King Grenier had really hidden gold? She was dumbfounded. Then she thought, if the gold was in one statue, could it be in another? She had to find out. She gently placed the broken pieces on the bed and ran to the trunk to get the other one. She winced as she banged it against the stone hearth. It took three tries before the head broke off.</p><p>\u201cSorry, St. Biel,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>And there it was. Gold. The second statue was filled with gold, too.</p><p>She had to sit down again. It was all too much to take in. The statue in the storeroom had to be filled with gold as well. There was no need to break it.</p><p>Another statue was coming from Wellingshire. The statue her mother brought with her when she married. Did her mother know the secret of St. Biel?</p><p>One thought led to another and another, and soon her mind was spinning. Was the giant statue overlooking the harbor in St. Biel filled with gold? She began to laugh. Of course it was. Oh, what a clever man King Grenier had been.</p><p>She sat on the bed a long time as she thought about the story her mother had helped her memorize. Once upon a time in the year of...The hints were there, but had her mother figured it out? And if she had, did she tell her husband?</p><p>Gabrielle didn\u2019t know how long she sat in a daze. She put the broken pieces back in the trunk and closed it.</p><p>When she returned to the hall, her father appeared to be more relaxed. Colm looked relieved to see her. He kissed her quickly, and said, \u201cI will leave you to talk with your father.\u201d In a lower voice he added, \u201cCome to bed soon.\u201d</p><p>Liam also took his leave so that she and her father could have a private conversation. Gabrielle sat close to him in front of the fire.</p><p>Before he could ask, she blurted, \u201cI love him, Father.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI can see that you do.\u201d</p><p>She spent the next ten minutes telling him about Colm\u2019s many virtues.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you will ever marry again, Father? I would be pleased if you did. I do not like to think of you being lonely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you aren\u2019t too weary, I have questions to ask you...about St. Biel.\u201d</p><p>GABRIELLE LAY beside her husband and whispered sweet words to him. They had just made love, and she was still breathless. They had spoken briefly about Coswold, but now in the darkness she told him how frightened she had been.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid I would not see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could not bear to lose you,\u201d he whispered. His voice shook. \u201cI will say this now. I love you, Gabrielle.\u201d</p><p>Tears welled up in her eyes. \u201cYou love me,\u201d she whispered. She leaned up and kissed his chin. \u201cYou have just given me the gift my father gave to my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove was his gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was. And it was a long time coming, I think. For my mother anyway. She did not like Father much when they were wed. He took her from her home in St. Biel. I thought it would take you much longer to give me the words. You were forever leaving me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI will admit this only once. You worried me. You had this power over me. I would lose my thoughts when I was with you. But no more will I leave you. Liam and Braeden will be given much more responsibility so I will have time with you.\u201d</p><p>They stayed quiet for a few minutes, and then she whispered, \u201cDo you like my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know him well enough to like him. He is a gruff man. He was not pleased to see the scratches on your arms and face, but when he heard Coswold was responsible, he could no longer blame me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boys got into my trunk today.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThey came in here...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were curious. You will have to remove the lid. I fear one of them will get trapped inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go to the Buchanans in a few days\u2019 time so that you may meet your dearest cousin,\u201d he teased. \u201cI think perhaps we will take Ethan and Tom with us and forget to bring them home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will not leave them. They are content here. Ethan broke one of my statues.\u201d</p><p>He yawned. \u201cHe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was filled with gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGold,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThe statue was filled with it. I broke another one just to see, and there was gold inside it as well.\u201d</p><p>His reaction was much like hers. He was astounded. \u201cThere really is a treasure.\u201d</p><p>Gabrielle repeated the story her mother had taught her. When she was finished, she said, \u201cNow that I know there is gold inside each statue, I realize how clever King Grenier was. The Crusaders were going to kill his loyal subjects because he made them pay a toll to pass over his mountains. They believed the country was filled with heathens, so what did the king do? He dedicated the country to a saint and changed its name, then sent a token amount of the gold to the pope. The Crusaders wouldn\u2019t dare harm any of his people. An attack on them would be an attack on the pope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would the king keep the gold hidden all that time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother told my father that the king was a wise man. He knew that great wealth can also provoke great greed. His countrymen were content.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd greed would corrupt their way of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Colm smiled. \u201cAye, he was clever to use his favorite saint to help save his country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is more to tell. I asked my father, and he told me my suspicions were true.\u201d She stretched up to whisper in his ear. \u201cThere is no St. Biel.\u201d</p><p>A long silence followed, and then Colm said, \u201cHe made up the saint...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe saved his people the only way he knew how,\u201d she defended. \u201cI wonder, though, what the church leaders would think if they knew. I cannot tell them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cNo, you cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKing John rules St. Biel now, and he will not get the treasure.
