Without it . . .</p><p>There are some nightmares the world will never be ready to face.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>HAWKE FOLDED HIS arms and leaned back against the solid bulk of his desk, eyes on the two young females in front of him. Hands clasped behind themselves and legs slightly spread in the \u201cresting\u201d stance, Sienna and Maria looked like the SnowDancer soldiers they were\u2014except for the fact that their hair straggled in a wild mess around their faces, matted with mud, crushed leaves, and other forest debris. Then there was the torn clothing and the sharp, acrid scent of blood.</p><p>His wolf bared its teeth.</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight,\u201d he said in a calm tone that had Maria turning pale under skin that was a warm, smooth brown where it wasn\u2019t bruised and bloody. \u201cInstead of staying on watch and protecting the pack\u2019s defensive border, you two decided to have your own personal dominance battle.\u201d</p> <p>Sienna, of course, met his gaze\u2014something no wolf would\u2019ve done in the circumstances. \u201cIt w\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d he snapped. \u201cIf you open your mouth again without permission, I\u2019m putting both of you in the pen with the two-year-olds.\u201d</p><p>Those amazing cardinal eyes\u2014white stars on a background of vivid black\u2014went a pure ebony, which he knew full well indicated fury, but she clenched her jaw. Maria, on the other hand, had gone even paler. Good.</p><p>\u201cMaria,\u201d he said, focusing on the petite changeling whose size belied her skill and strength in both human and wolf form. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><p>Maria swallowed. \u201cTwenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a juvenile.\u201d</p><p>Maria\u2019s thick black curls, heavy with mud, bounced dully as she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen explain this to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight answer.\u201d No reason they could offer up would be a good enough excuse for the bullshit fight. \u201cWho threw the first punch?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>His wolf approved. It mattered little who\u2019d incited the exchange when neither had walked away from it, and the fact of the matter was, they\u2019d been meant to work as a team, so they\u2019d take their punishment as a team\u2014with one caveat.</p><p>\u201cSeven days,\u201d he said to Maria. \u201cConfined to quarters except for one hour each day. No contact with anyone while you\u2019re inside.\u201d It was a harsh punishment\u2014wolves were creatures of Pack, of family, and Maria was one of the most bubbly, social wolves in the den. To force her to spend all that time alone was an indication of just how badly she\u2019d blundered. \u201cThe next time you decide to step off watch, I won\u2019t be so lenient.\u201d</p><p>Maria chanced meeting his gaze for a fleeting second before those rich brown eyes skated away, her dominance no match for his. \u201cMay I attend Lake\u2019s twenty-first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the use you want to make of your hour on the day.\u201d Yeah, it made him a bastard to force her to miss most of her boyfriend\u2019s big party, especially when the two were taking the first, careful steps into a relationship, but she\u2019d known exactly what she was doing when she decided to engage in a pissing contest with a fellow soldier.</p><p>SnowDancer was strong as a pack because they watched each other\u2019s backs. Hawke would not allow stupidity or arrogance to eat away at a foundation he\u2019d rebuilt from the ground up after the bloody events that had stolen both his parents and savaged the pack so badly it had taken more than a decade of tight isolation for them to recover.</p><p>Holding on to his temper by a very thin thread, he turned his attention to Sienna. \u201cYou were,\u201d he said, the wolf very much in his voice, \u201cspecifically ordered not to get into any physical altercations.\u201d</p><p>Sienna said nothing in response. It didn\u2019t matter\u2014her rage was a hot pulse against his skin, as raw and stormy as Sienna herself. When she was like this, the wildness of her barely contained, it was hard to believe she\u2019d come into his pack Silent, her emotions blockaded behind so much ice, it had infuriated his wolf.</p><p>Maria shifted on her feet when he didn\u2019t immediately continue.</p><p>\u201cYou have something to say?\u201d he asked the woman, who was one of the best novice soldiers in the pack when she didn\u2019t let her temper get in the way.</p><p>\u201cI started it.\u201d Color high on her cheekbones, shoulders tight. \u201cShe was just defending\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sienna\u2019s tone was steady, resolute, the anger buried under a wall of frigid control. \u201cI\u2019ll take my share of the blame. I could\u2019ve walked away.\u201d</p><p>Hawke narrowed his eyes. \u201cMaria, go.\u201d</p><p>The novice soldier hesitated for a second, but she was a subordinate wolf, her natural instinct to obey her alpha too powerful to resist\u2014even though it was clear she wanted to remain behind to support Sienna. Hawke noted and approved of the display of loyalty enough that he didn\u2019t rebuke her for the hesitation.</p><p>The door closed behind her with a quiet snick that seemed shotgun-loud inside the office\u2019s heavy silence. Hawke waited to see what Sienna would do now that they were alone. To his surprise, she maintained her position.</p><p>Reaching forward, he gripped her chin, turning her face to the side so that the light fell on the smooth lines of it. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you don\u2019t have a broken cheekbone.\u201d The flesh around her eye was going to turn all shades of purple as it was. \u201cWhere else are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened on her jaw. \u201cWhere else are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask Maria.\u201d Stubborn will in every word.</p><p>\u201cMaria is a wolf, able to take five times the damage of a Psy female and keep going.\u201d Which was the reason Sienna had been ordered not to get into physical confrontations with the wolves. That and the fact that she didn\u2019t have her lethal abilities under total control. \u201cEither you answer the question, or I swear to God I really will put you in the pen.\u201d It would be the most humiliating of experiences and she knew it, every muscle in her body taut with viciously withheld anger.</p><p>\u201cBruised ribs,\u201d she gritted out at last, \u201cbruised abdomen, wrenched shoulder. Nothing\u2019s broken. It should all heal within the next week.\u201d</p><p>Dropping his grip on her chin, he said, \u201cHold out your arms.\u201d</p><p>A hesitation.</p><p>The wolf growled, loud enough that she flinched. \u201cSienna, I\u2019ve given you a long leash since you came into the pack, but that ends today.\u201d Insubordination from a juvenile could be punished and forgiven. In an adult, in a soldier , it was a far more serious matter. Sienna was nineteen going on twenty, a ranked novice\u2014letting her actions slide wasn\u2019t even an option. \u201cHold out your fucking arms.\u201d</p><p>Something in his tone must\u2019ve gotten through to her because she did as ordered. A few small cuts on that creamy skin kissed gold by the sun, but no gouges that would\u2019ve spoken of claws. \u201cSo Maria managed to rein in the wolf.\u201d If she hadn\u2019t, he\u2019d have kicked her right back into training. Losing control of your temper was one thing; losing control of your wolf was far more dangerous.</p><p>Sienna\u2019s hands fisted as she dropped them to her sides.</p><p>Looking up, he met those eyes of absolute, unbroken black. It was clear she was fighting the elemental impulse to go at him, but she continued to hold her position. \u201cHow far did you go?\u201d Her control was impressive\u2014and it irritated him in a way it shouldn\u2019t have. But then, nothing about Sienna Lauren had ever been easy.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t use my abilities.\u201d The tendons in her neck stood out against the dirt-encrusted hue of her skin. \u201cIf I had, she\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why you\u2019re in far more trouble than Maria.\u201d When he\u2019d given the Lauren family sanctuary after their defection from the cold sterility of the PsyNet, it had been under a number of strict conditions. One of those conditions had been a prohibition against using Psy abilities on packmates.</p><p>A significant number of things had changed since that time, and the Laurens were now an integral and accepted part of the pack. Sienna\u2019s uncle, Judd, was one of Hawke\u2019s lieutenants, and often used his telepathic and telekinetic abilities in defense of SnowDancer. Hawke had also never tied the hands of the two youngest Laurens, knowing Marlee and Toby would need their mental claws to defend themselves against their rambunctious wolf playmates.</p><p>But that freedom didn\u2019t extend to Sienna, because Hawke knew exactly what she could do. The instant Judd accepted the lieutenant blood bond, keeping secrets from his alpha had become a question of loyalty and trust.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Sienna lifted her chin. \u201cI didn\u2019t disobey the rule about using my abilities.\u201d</p><p>Naturally, she\u2019d challenge him. \u201cBut,\u201d he said, reining in the wolf\u2019s snarling response to her defiance, \u201cyou did disobey a direct order in engaging in the fight\u2014you said it yourself, you could\u2019ve walked away.\u201d</p><p>White lines bracketed her mouth. \u201cWould you have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about me.\u201d He\u2019d been a young hothead once upon a time, and he\u2019d had his ass kicked for it . . . until everything had changed, his childhood wiped out in a surge of blood and pain and piercing sorrow. \u201cWe both know your lack of control could\u2019ve led to a far more serious outcome.\u201d The hell of it was, she knew that, too\u2014and still she\u2019d let herself cross the line. That angered Hawke more than anything else.</p><p>\u201cI could be confined to DarkRiver land,\u201d Sienna said while he was considering how to deal with her, \u201cif you don\u2019t want me in the den.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hawke snorted at her reference to the leopard pack that was SnowDancer\u2019s most trusted ally. \u201cSo you can hang out with your boyfriend? Nice try.\u201d</p><p>Sienna\u2019s skin flushed a dull red. \u201cKit isn\u2019t my boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>Hawke wasn\u2019t going to get into that conversation. Not now. Not ever. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to have a say in your punishment.\u201d He\u2019d spoiled her. It was his own damn fault it was coming back to bite him in the ass. \u201cOne week confined to quarters in the soldiers area, one hour out per day.\u201d Psy were much better at handling isolation than changelings, but he knew Sienna had changed since defecting from the PsyNet, become far more intertwined in the bonds of family, of Pack. \u201cSecond week spent working with the babies in the nursery, since that\u2019s the age you\u2019ve been acting recently. No duty rotations until you can be trusted to stick to your task.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She snapped her mouth shut when he raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cThree weeks,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThird week you\u2019ll spend in the kitchens as a dish hand.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks burned a hotter shade, but she didn\u2019t interrupt again.</p><p>\u201cDismissed.\u201d</p><p>It was only after she\u2019d gone\u2014the autumn and spice of her scent lingering in the air in a silent rebellion she would\u2019ve undoubtedly enjoyed had she known about it\u2014that he loosened his hold on the wolf who was his more feral half.</p> <p>It lunged for her scent.</p><p>Sucking in a harsh breath, Hawke fought the primal urge to go after her. He\u2019d been battling the instinct for months, ever since the wolf decided that she was now an adult and, therefore, fair prey. The human half of him wasn\u2019t having much success in changing the wolf\u2019s mind, not when he had to fight the hunger to claim the most intimate of skin privileges every time she was in his presence.</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Picking up the sleek new sat phone the techs had issued him four weeks ago, he put through a call to DarkRiver\u2019s alpha.</p><p>Lucas answered on the second ring. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSienna won\u2019t be heading down to spend time with you cats for a while.\u201d Aside from the distance Sienna apparently needed from the den, from him, she\u2019d been working with Lucas\u2019s Psy mate, Sascha, to understand and gain control of her abilities. But\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t let it go. Not this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d The answer of a fellow alpha.</p> <p>Hawke sat on the edge of his desk, shoving a hand through his hair. \u201cCan she handle it?\u201d He knew she wouldn\u2019t break\u2014Sienna was too strong for that, a strength that acted like a drug on his wolf\u2014but the power that lived within her was so vast, it had to be treated as the wildest of beasts.</p><p>\u201cLast time she was down,\u201d Lucas responded, \u201cSascha said she displayed an exceptional level of stability, nothing like when they first began to work together. They\u2019re not having regular meetings anymore, so that\u2019s not an issue.\u201d</p><p>Mind at rest on that score at least, Hawke said, \u201cI\u2019ll make sure Judd keeps a psychic eye on her just in case.\u201d Sienna wouldn\u2019t appreciate the oversight, but fact was fact\u2014she was dangerous, and he had to consider the safety of the pack as a whole. As for the ferocity of his protective instincts when it came to her, he wasn\u2019t about to lie and pretend they didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask what happened?\u201d Lucas\u2019s tone was curious.</p><p>Hawke gave the cat a quick rundown. \u201cShe\u2019s been worse this past month.\u201d Prior to that, her newfound stability had been noticed\u2014and approved of\u2014by all the senior members of the pack. \u201cI\u2019ve got to start coming down hard on her or it\u2019ll cause discontent in the den.\u201d Hierarchy was the glue that held a wolf pack together. As alpha, Hawke was at the top of that hierarchy. He could not, would not, accept rebellion from a subordinate.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get it,\u201d Lucas replied. \u201cSurprises me though. She\u2019s the perfect soldier down here, doesn\u2019t ever give me lip. Got a mind as sharp as a razor.\u201d</p><p>Hawke flexed and unflexed his claws. \u201cYeah, well, she\u2019s not yours.\u201d</p><p>A long, quiet pause. \u201cI heard you were seeing someone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to gossip?\u201d Hawke made no attempt to hide his irritation.</p><p>\u201cKit and the other novices saw you with some drop-dead gorgeous blonde a few weeks ago. At a restaurant down by Pier 39.\u201d</p><p>He thought back. \u201cShe\u2019s a media consultant with CTX.\u201d SnowDancer and DarkRiver held majority shares in the communications company, an investment that was paying off big-time as even Psy began to search for news reports free of the crushing influence of their dictatorial ruling Council. \u201cWanted to talk to me about doing an interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s it going to be on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time you see a pig flying past the window.\u201d Hawke didn\u2019t play for the cameras, and he\u2019d made damn sure Ms. Consultant understood that SnowDancer wasn\u2019t planning to change its mean and carnivorous image to pretty and fluffy anytime soon. She could work with that or find another posi\u2014A sudden thought sliced clean through his remembered annoyance, had his hand tightening on the phone. \u201cWas Sienna with the novices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>It was Hawke who paused this time, his wolf taking a watchful stance, caught between two competing needs. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do about that, Luc,\u201d he said at last, every muscle in his body taut to the point of pain.</p><p>\u201cThat was what Nate said.\u201d</p><p>The leopard sentinel was now happily mated with two cubs.</p><p>\u201cNot the same.\u201d It wasn\u2019t simply a question of age\u2014the brutal fact was that Hawke\u2019s mate was dead. Had died as a child. Sienna didn\u2019t understand what that meant, how little he had to give her, give any woman. If he was selfish enough to succumb to the unnamed but powerful pull between them, he knew full well he\u2019d destroy her.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be happy. Think about it.\u201d Luc hung up.</p><p>She hasn\u2019t slept with him, you know . . . Don\u2019t leave it too late, Hawke, or you might just lose her.</p><p>Indigo\u2019s words two months ago, speaking about Sienna and that cub who was stuck to her like glue whenever Hawke turned around. Aside from the fact the boy was a leopard, there was nothing wrong with Kit. He\u2019d make the perfect ma\u2014</p><p>A crunching sound.</p><p>His new sat phone bore a jagged crack through the screen.</p><p>RECOVERED FROM COMPUTER 2(A) TAGS: PERSONAL CORRESPONDENCE, FATHER, E-PSY, ACTION REQUIRED AND COMPLETED1</p><p>FROM: Alice &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>TO: Dad &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>DATE: September 26th, 1970 at 11:43pm</p><p>SUBJECT: News!!</p><p>Hi Dad,</p><p>I have the most exciting news. While I\u2019m currently completing my thesis on E-Psy, I\u2019ve just gained funding to do a second study on the rare X designation! The grant committee referenced my two papers last year and said that my outsider\u2019s view on Psy abilities had given rise to some unique conclusions\u2014I suppose they\u2019re right. I\u2019m not Psy after all. My Es never made me feel like an outsider, but that\u2019s their gift, isn\u2019t it?</p><p>George, who will soon be a colleague rather than my supervisor, says I\u2019m setting myself up for failure with this project since the Psy Council has been getting harder to deal with of late. Plus, so little is known about the Xs. But that\u2019s the point of it, I tell him. I might not be an archaeologist like you, Dad, but I\u2019m exploring my own strange lands.</p><p>Speaking of George, he\u2019s working on a paper about the development of the Internet. He\u2019s adamant it wouldn\u2019t have developed as fast as it did had we not had the PsyNet as an example and impetus, and I have to agree\u2014funding alone came thick and fast in the early days because businesses wanted informational parity. He wants another anthropologist\u2019s take on it, so I said I would forward it to Mom (will you tell her?).</p><p>I hope the sands of Egypt are being kind to you both.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Alice</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>HER CALM FACADE shattering like so much glass the instant she was behind closed doors, Sienna kicked the back wall of the quarters she\u2019d been assigned in the area of the den set aside for unmated soldiers. She rarely used this room, preferring to live with her brother, Toby; uncle Walker; and cousin, Marlee. But now she was stuck in this small, sterile space for the next week.</p><p>Sienna, I\u2019ve given you a long leash since you came into the pack, but that ends today.</p><p>She flinched at the echo of memory. There\u2019d been nothing but the most cutting anger in those eyes of a blue so very pale, they were those of a husky given human form. Paired with that mane of silver-gold and, most of all, that alpha personality, Hawke was a man who invited female attention without effort.</p><p>Her hand fisted. Because today, he hadn\u2019t seen a woman in front of him, but an unreliable member of the pack, one who\u2019d put SnowDancer in danger with her actions. No punishment he could\u2019ve given her could compare to her own self-recrimination. The ice-cold knot of shame in her gut was a chill reminder of just how badly she\u2019d messed up. All this time and work, and when it came down to it, she\u2019d allowed her temper to overrule her rational mind.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Sienna.\u201d Thrusting her hands into her hair, she grimaced at the dried mud that flaked down her face, and began to strip. It took her less than a minute to bare herself to the skin. Stalking into the tiny shower, deeply grateful that the pack-minded wolves had set it up so everyone had private facilities, she washed the dirt, grass, and blood off her body before beginning to untangle the long, mud-stiff strands of her hair.</p><p>It took a long time.</p><p>Through it all, frustration\u2014at herself, at her inability to let go of something that was tearing her apart piece by painful piece\u2014raged like a caged tiger within her. If the changelings had a beast inside of them, then so did she, and it was a far more vicious thing, far colder in its ability to destroy. Right now, that beast was focused inward, raking at her with searing claws. Lowering the water temperature, she shampooed her hair twice, then ran the conditioner through it, bringing it forward over her shoulder to make sure she got the ends. It was only when she was almost finished that she realized what she was seeing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Grabbing a wet hunk of hair, she lifted it to her eyes and swore. The powerful resonance of her ability had neutralized the dye. Again. For the third time in a month. It spoke to a lack of control that worried her. She\u2019d been so good since she began to spend a large amount of time in DarkRiver territory, her Psy abilities so stable that the fear that had locked around her throat since her defection had burned away in a storm of confidence.</p><p>Then she\u2019d seen\u2014\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Snapping off the water, she stepped out and picked up a large, fluffy towel Brenna had given her as part of a birthday gift. It was thick and luxuriant against her flesh, a sensory pleasure she couldn\u2019t help but embrace . . . just like she couldn\u2019t resist the compulsion that had led to her current situation.</p> <p>She clenched her jaw so tight it shot a bolt of pain along the bone. But the sensory shock helped her shake off the gut-deep craving that never quite left her, and she concentrated on rubbing herself dry. The bathroom mirror, when she glanced at it, showed her a female of average height with hair of such a deep, deep red it appeared black when wet.</p><p>\u201cLike the heart of ruby,\u201d Sascha had said the last time they\u2019d put in the dye, the empath\u2019s hands gentle on Sienna\u2019s scalp. \u201cSuch a shame we have to cover it up.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter. Her hair was too distinctive. Then again, Sienna thought\u2014staring at a face that had become refined in a very feminine way, all trace of childish softness having melted away while she hadn\u2019t been looking\u2014maybe it was safe now.</p><p>Her hair had in fact darkened in the years since her defection from the PsyNet. Aside from the changes in her face, her body was both noticeably curvier and more muscled. While she carried the muscle in a fluid way that didn\u2019t bulk her up, no one who had known her while she\u2019d been jacked into the Net would recognize her now. Especially given the brown contact lenses she always wore outside of SnowDancer territory.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t worn them today. The bruised eyes that looked back at her were those of a cardinal, a genetic marker that set her apart from the world in a way that couldn\u2019t be explained, not even to another cardinal. Perhaps the only person who had ever come close to understanding the violence of what lived within her had been her mother, a cardinal telepath with her own demons. Sienna\u2019s brother, Toby, was a cardinal, too. Three in one family . . . it was extraordinary.</p> <p>But not as extraordinary as a cardinal X surviving to adulthood.</p><p>A hard, rapping knock.</p><p>Jumping at the sound, she quickly pulled on underwear, a clean T-shirt, and the soft black pants she liked to wear at home. \u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d she called out when the pounding started again. Since her door had a note indicating she was confined to quarters, it could only be one of the senior members of the pack.</p><p>Damp hair tucked behind her ears, she opened the door to come face to face with a man who was unquestionably lethal. \u201cJudd.\u201d It surprised her that he hadn\u2019t \u2019pathed to her instead of tracking her down.</p><p>Then he spoke. \u201cCan you handle being confined?\u201d</p><p>The edge of the door dug into her palm, a hard, cold bite. \u201cHe asked you to make sure of that, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>Judd Lauren might\u2019ve been her mother\u2019s brother, but he\u2019d also been an Arrow, one of the Psy Council\u2019s most deadly assassins. He was better at maintaining a mask than anyone she knew, and now his face told her nothing. \u201cAnswer the question.\u201d His tone made it clear he was asking not as her uncle, but as a SnowDancer lieutenant.</p><p>She came to attention. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Her emotions were causing her shields to shudder as her thoughts ricocheted in a hundred different directions, but they were holding. That was all that mattered, because without her shields, she\u2019d be a far more destructive threat than any manmade weapon.</p><p>Judd\u2019s eyes never moved off her, and she knew he\u2019d made his own assessment of her status even before he nodded. \u201cYou know what to do the instant there\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She\u2019d \u2019path him, and he\u2019d teleport in, shoot to incapacitate. If the shock of pain didn\u2019t splinter her psychic focus, he\u2019d aim for her head next. It sounded barbaric and she knew it would break something in him to do it, but someone had to act as the failsafe, a backup in case she could no longer stop herself. Because the fact was, she was a cardinal with a martial ability. There was a high chance her shields would lock down the instant she went live. Not even an Arrow would be able to break through on the psychic plane.</p><p>A physical attack was the sole avenue left. Her certainty that Judd would strike that blow if necessary was the only thing that allowed her to live without constantly fearing for the safety of everyone around her. Though notwithstanding her current situation, she\u2019d achieved near-perfect psychic discipline in the preceding months, something no one, not even she, had expected of an X outside Silence.</p><p>The reminder had her steeling her spine. \u201cI\u2019ll use the time alone to augment and refine the controls you and Sascha helped me develop.\u201d Judd wasn\u2019t an X, but as a dangerously strong telekinetic, he understood the bone-deep fear that drove her to keep the vicious strength of her abilities trapped in the steel cage of her mind. It was also why he\u2019d kill her if it came down to it.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Leaning forward, he cupped her cheek, the gesture no longer as startling as it once might\u2019ve been\u2014before Judd mated with a wolf who had survived her own nightmare. \u201cI did wonder when you were going to push Hawke too far.\u201d Stroking his thumb over her cheekbone, he brushed a kiss on her forehead. \u201cTake some of this time to think, Sienna, figure out where you\u2019re heading.\u201d</p><p>Her emotions a tight knot in her chest, she closed the door after he left and walked back to the bathroom to pick up the brush on the shelf by the mirror. \u201cHawke\u2019s mate is dead,\u201d she made herself say to the woman who was her reflection, her fingers clenching to bloodless tightness around the carved wood of the handle. \u201cHe buried his heart with her.\u201d</p> <p>Even in the face of that harsh truth, the brutal compulsion inside of her refused to be extinguished, to be contained. Like the destructive power of an X, it threatened to consume her until only ashes remained.</p><p>LARA was on her way out of the den when she ran into Judd Lauren. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, hefting the medical kit she was in the process of slinging over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Noticing the direction he\u2019d come from, she said, \u201cI heard Sienna and Maria returned from their watch hurt, but no one\u2019s called me. They okay?\u201d</p><p>The Psy lieutenant followed her lead out of the den and into the searing sunshine and crisp air of the Sierra Nevada before answering, \u201cScratches and bruises, nothing major.\u201d</p><p>Her healer\u2019s heart settling, she lifted her face to the painful clarity of the chrome blue sky. \u201cIt\u2019s days like this that make me glad to be a SnowDancer.\u201d To be a wolf.</p><p>\u201cBrenna and I went for an early morning run, when the mist was rising up off the ground.\u201d Judd\u2019s tone gentled in a way she knew he wasn\u2019t aware of when he spoke of his mate.</p><p>\u201cI love that time of day.\u201d When everything was fresh, the entire world a hushed secret. \u201cWhich direction did you go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other side of the lake,\u201d he answered as they moved on. \u201cSo\u2014who\u2019s injured?\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cTwo of the juveniles were doing God knows what, and now I have a broken arm and three cracked ribs to heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t usually need this.\u201d He tapped the medical kit.</p><p>\u201cJuveniles,\u201d Lara muttered, \u201coccasionally need to learn a lesson about the fact that maybe they should take better care not to break their limbs. I\u2019ll do some healing to ensure everything is as it should be, then cast the arm, strap the ribs.\u201d It would take longer to mend than if she used her gift to fully repair the injuries, but would do the boys no harm.</p><p>\u201cThe peripheral benefit is it keeps my medical skills from getting rusty, plus it allows me to hold my healing abilities in reserve in case we have a sudden critical injury.\u201d While Hawke could share his strength with her through their healer-alpha bond, her own body could only handle so much before it collapsed.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Judd pushed up a branch so she could pass underneath. Which was why she was in front when they entered the clearing, where one of the injured boys lay propped up against a tree, cradling his arm. The other sat cross-legged, clutching at his ribs. Brace was tall and lanky, though Joshua had put on a bit of muscle over the past couple of months. Right now, however, both looked like shamed six-year-olds.</p><p>The reason, Lara guessed as her heart thudded hard against her ribs, was the man standing with his arms folded, looking down at the two miscreants. \u201cWalker.\u201d She\u2019d scented the dark water and snow-dusted fir of his scent as she and Judd neared but had put it down to the fact that he was often in this area with the younger teens\u2014having been put in charge of the ten-to-thirteen-year-olds. A tough age for wolves, but Walker handled them without so much as raising his voice.</p><p>She could understand why\u2014quiet, intense Walker Lauren had a presence akin to that of any dominant wolf. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you here.\u201d Her voice came out a little husky to her own ears, but no one else seemed to notice.</p><p>Walker\u2019s pale green eyes held hers for a long, tense second. \u201cI was passing by when I glimpsed these two.\u201d His gaze shifted over her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll carry it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to speak\u2014bring the kids for dinner.\u201d Judd melted away into the forest so fast, Lara didn\u2019t even manage to turn around in time.</p><p>\u201cLara, it hurts.\u201d It was an almost apologetic voice.</p><p>Wrenching away the suffocating web of want and anger and hurt that had wrapped around her, she went to her knees. \u201cLet me see, sweetheart,\u201d she said, checking first Brace, then Joshua. \u201cHold still for a second.\u201d Using the pressure injector, she gave them each a shot of painkiller.</p><p>She was vividly conscious of Walker hunkering down beside her, his body big, the scent of him as cool and reserved as the man himself. As she worked, he spoke to Joshua and Brace. Whatever they\u2019d done to get into trouble, the boys\u2019 wolves relaxed at once under his attention. Lara only wished her own wolf wasn\u2019t so hypersensitive to his presence, until its fur rubbed up against the inside of her skin\u2014but sensitivity aside, the wolf maintained a wary distance. Both parts of her had learned their lesson when it came to Walker Lauren. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere,\u201d she said a while later as both boys checked out Brace\u2019s high-tech cast, made of a transparent plascrete. \u201cAny pain or discomfort, you come to me straight away, you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Lara.\u201d A brilliant smile from Joshua followed by a kiss from each teenager\u2014one on either cheek\u2014before they got up and raced off, as if they hadn\u2019t been fighting tears not long before.</p><p>Shaking her head even as her wolf did the same in affectionate amusement, Lara packed up her gear and watched Walker pick up the bag without effort. It took several attempts to get anything out through a throat gone dry as dust, but she was determined not to allow him to unsettle her. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>A silent nod.</p><p>As they walked back, Lara\u2019s mind rebelled against her own resolution, drowning her in thoughts of that kiss the night Riaz returned to the den. The senior members of the pack had thrown the lieutenant an impromptu welcome-home party. The bubbles had been flowing, and Lara, who didn\u2019t usually drink, had had a little too much champagne. It had given her the courage not only to argue with the tall Psy male who\u2019d fascinated her since he first entered the den, but to drag him into a dark corner, go on tiptoe, and find his mouth with her own.</p><p>He\u2019d kissed her back, slow and deep and with that powerful body held in fierce check, his hands curving around her ribs as he pulled her into the V of his thighs. The strong muscles in his neck had flexed under her fingers when he angled his head to deepen the kiss, the slight abrasiveness of his unshaven jaw rubbing a rough caress over her skin.</p><p>Big as he was, she\u2019d felt surrounded by him, overwhelmed in the most sensual of ways, his shoulders blocking out the world as he backed her to the wall. She might\u2019ve been buzzed, but she\u2019d never forget a single instant of that experience. Woman and wolf, every part of her had been stunned at her success . . . for the five short seconds it lasted.</p><p>Then Walker had lifted his head and nudged her back to the party. She\u2019d thought he was acting the gentleman since she was a tad tipsy, but he would surely do what all dominants did when they wanted a woman, seek her out again when she was sober. He hadn\u2019t called her the next morning, which hadn\u2019t left her in the best of moods. But he had called her later that same afternoon.</p> <p>They\u2019d gone for a walk, her heart in her throat the entire time. She\u2019d thought it was a beginning. Until Walker had stopped on the edge of a cliff that fell into a valley with dramatic suddenness, his dark blond hair pushed back by the breeze, and said, \u201cWhat happened last night was a mistake, Lara.\u201d His tone had been gentle, and that had made it all the more terrible. \u201cI apologize.\u201d</p><p>Ice crawled through her veins, but not wanting to make a mistake, she\u2019d asked, \u201cBecause I had too much champagne?\u201d</p><p>The answer had been absolute, the rejection crystal clear. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She thought she might\u2019ve made some smiling remark before excusing herself to walk back to the den alone, but all she could remember was the crushing black of her emotions. God, this man, he\u2019d hurt her. However, if it had been a simple case of unrequited attraction, she\u2019d have forgiven him\u2014as she knew too well, you couldn\u2019t control who you fell for.</p><p>No, what had hurt and angered her was that it hadn\u2019t all been in her head. She knew when a man wanted her, and Walker had wanted her . . . enough to kiss, apparently, but not to keep. If that was the case, he was plenty big and strong enough to have stopped her kiss before it ever touched his lips. He hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d held her as if she mattered before breaking her heart. And that, she couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t forgive.</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d</p> <p>Glancing up at that face drawn in rough masculine lines, she shoved the memories back where they belonged: in the past. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said with a smile built out of pure pride. \u201cI know the kit\u2019s heavy. I can take it the rest of the way.\u201d</p><p>Walker ignored her attempt to keep the conversation casual. \u201cWe haven\u2019t spoken for several weeks.\u201d</p><p>She knew he was referring to the late-night conversations they\u2019d had before the kiss. Walker was a night owl. Lara often stayed up late with her patients. Somehow, they\u2019d ended up having coffee around eleven most nights\u2014with Walker keeping a telepathic eye on his daughter and nephew when Sienna wasn\u2019t able to stay with them. They hadn\u2019t talked about anything of particular note, but those nights had given her the courage to do something that didn\u2019t come easily to a wolf who wasn\u2019t a dominant.</p><p>Healers never were\u2014though they weren\u2019t submissive, either. Normally, her packmates\u2019 dominance simply didn\u2019t affect Lara, though her wolf had the ability to put all of them, young or old, at ease. However, things didn\u2019t work the same with Walker. Still, she\u2019d made the first move, chanced that kiss that had led to her humiliation.</p><p>Since his rejection, she\u2019d made sure to be busy or not in the infirmary around that time; the wound was too fresh. But time had passed, things had changed; she wasn\u2019t only surviving, she was holding her own in this encounter. That didn\u2019t mean she was about to allow Walker to make his way back into her life, not when she was ready to move on at last.</p><p>\u201cHave you forgotten? We spoke when I patched Marlee up after she skinned her knee,\u201d she said with a laugh that sounded natural. \u201cActually\u201d\u2014she held out her hand for the kit\u2014\u201cif you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d prefer to walk the rest of the distance alone. It\u2019ll give me some thinking time.\u201d</p><p>Walker stood unmoving, pale green eyes locked on her. \u201cAnd if I do mind?\u201d</p><p>An uncomfortable heaviness gathered in the air.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t understand why he was pushing this, but what she did know was that she wasn\u2019t going to open the lid on that box. Not today or any other day. \u201cIf you\u2019re okay to carry it back,\u201d she said, misunderstanding on purpose, \u201cthen thanks.\u201d With that and a cheery wave, she headed off into the woods in the direction of the waterfall.</p><p>There, she thought, it was done, that excruciating chapter of her life closed.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>COUNCILOR HENRY SCOTT had made the decision to sacrifice San Francisco two months ago, regardless of the economic and financial upheaval such destruction would cause. Now it was simply a case of putting the final pieces in place.</p><p>With that in mind, he turned away from the view of the busy streets visible through the window of the office he kept at his London residence, and to the man he\u2019d placed in charge of coordinating his military resources\u2014all of which had now been integrated into the streamlined structure of Pure Psy. The original civilian personnel had been quietly moved out of command positions.</p><p>Henry didn\u2019t need a political party. He needed a weapon.</p><p>Which was why Vasquez was now in charge of all Pure Psy operations. There was nothing prepossessing about the man\u2014he stood a bare five feet four inches, with a build more akin to that of a gymnast than a soldier, and a face so unremarkable people forgot him within minutes of meeting him.</p><p>\u201cHow long,\u201d Henry asked, \u201cbefore we can move on San Francisco and the surrounding changeling-held areas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month.\u201d Bringing up the files on the main comm screen, Vasquez gave Henry a pr\u00e9cis of their current status as regarding men and weapons. \u201cWhat the wolves call \u2018den territory\u2019 will be the most difficult to take, but I\u2019m working on a possible solution.\u201d</p><p>Henry nodded, left it at that. Vasquez would be useless to him if he didn\u2019t think for himself\u2014something Henry\u2019s \u201cwife,\u201d Shoshanna, would do well to emulate when it came to her own advisors. She surrounded herself with flunkies, none of them with the intelligence of a gnat. Which was why Henry was running this, while Shoshanna thought she held the reins. \u201cAre there any problems I need to be aware of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, we\u2019ll meet again in a week\u2019s time.\u201d</p><p>It was only after Vasquez left that Henry brought up another file. It was his investment portfolio, and once again, it was in worse shape than warranted. He didn\u2019t have to be an expert to realize whose hand lay behind the slow, untraceable strangulation of his finances\u2014Nikita Duncan was a master at manipulating money. However, while her actions were certainly problematic, the losses were nowhere near enough to stop him. He\u2019d take San Francisco soon enough, obliterating the base of her empire.</p><p>As for the changelings . . . they could not be allowed to live, not after their constant and continuing defiance. They believed themselves immune to the Council\u2019s reach to the extent that they\u2019d encouraged the conception of a hybrid with changeling blood, a fetus that if it came to term, would result in the dilution of the psychic abilities that made the Psy race the most powerful on the planet.</p><p>Henry wouldn\u2019t permit it.</p><p>It was time the world went back to the way it had been for over a century, the way it should be, with the purest of Psy in power, and the other two races allowed to exist only so long as they followed Psy rule. When people thought of SnowDancer and DarkRiver, Henry wanted them to see the blood-soaked cost of noncompliance.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>THREE DAYS AFTER the situation with Maria and Sienna, Hawke found himself looking down at a small, big-eyed face. Going down on his haunches to meet that wildly curious gaze, he said, \u201cLooking serious, Ben.\u201d</p><p>The five-and-half-year-old, who happened to be one of Hawke\u2019s favorite people in the den, nodded. \u201cDidja really put Sinna in jail?\u201d</p><p>Hawke bit the inside of his cheek. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Brown eyes the same dark shade as Ben\u2019s mother\u2019s, turned wolf-amber in shock. \u201cHow come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t follow the rules.\u201d</p><p>Ben thought about it for a second, lines wrinkling up that baby-smooth forehead. \u201cIs it like time-out for grown-ups?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d A decisive nod. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Marlee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Marlee sad?\u201d The girl was Sienna\u2019s cousin and part of his pack\u2014Hawke wouldn\u2019t allow her to be hurt.</p><p>Ben shook his head. \u201cHer dad said that Sinna had been naughty and that\u2019s why she got put in jail, but Marlee said you wouldn\u2019t put Sinna in jail and that Sinna was probably just grumpy and didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Having\u2014somehow\u2014followed all that, Hawke rose to his feet and tousled Ben\u2019s dark hair, the little boy\u2019s head warm under his touch. \u201cShe\u2019ll be out in a few days.\u201d And working in the nursery. The work itself, he knew, wouldn\u2019t be a chore for her. She was a natural protector, and like any protector, wolf or not, she enjoyed watching over the pups. They, in turn, felt utterly safe with her.</p><p>So no, it would be no hardship for her to work in the nursery. It was the fact that she\u2019d been taken off the duties befitting and expected of her rank that was the punishment\u2014a public indication that he didn\u2019t have trust in her ability to do the job. The blow would strike hard at the pride she wore like armor, but his wolf had no doubts about her steel spine, her iron will. Sienna wouldn\u2019t allow anything to crush her, especially not Hawke. On principle.</p><p>The thought made his wolf bare its canines in a feral grin. \u201cGo on home, Benny.\u201d</p> <p>The pup fell into step beside him instead, those short legs pumping as he ran to keep up. \u201cWhere\u2019re you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d</p> <p>Leaning down, Hawke picked Ben up under one arm like a football. \u201cBecause you\u2019re too short.\u201d</p><p>Ben giggled and pretended to swim. \u201cI\u2019m taller than I was last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s lips curved at the sheer love in that single word. \u201cI guess it must be true, then. But you\u2019re still too short.\u201d</p><p>A huge sigh. \u201cWhen am I going to be tall enough?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBefore you know it.\u201d Placing Ben down in front of the door that led to the White Zone, the safe play area for the kids, Hawke nudged him forward. \u201cGo kick a ball around. It\u2019ll make you grow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>Ben ran over to a clearing in the left section of the White Zone, to join in a game already in progress, one being watched over by an off-duty dominant who\u2019d come to hang with the little ones. Half the pups were in human form, the other half wolf. Clearly this was changeling-rules football, which included judicious nipping to make those in human form drop the ball.</p><p>Normally, the sight of a wolf streaking away with a football in his mouth as his friends tried to bite down on his tail would\u2019ve made Hawke laugh, join in. Today, his skin was too tight over his body, his own wolf edgy. Turning away, he headed into the hush of the forest, intending to work off the tension with some hard physical exercise. He hadn\u2019t made it more than a hundred meters beyond the White Zone when he froze.</p><p>The damn cub had his hands on Sienna.</p><p>His claws were slicing out of his skin before he\u2019d processed the thought.</p><p>As he watched, Kit angled his body to tuck Sienna even closer, his hands cupping her face to draw her in for an open-mouthed kiss that lasted long enough to have Hawke considering dismemberment. But the young leopard male broke the kiss before Hawke\u2019s wolf took control, clasping Sienna\u2019s hand to tug her deeper into the dark green firs that covered this area, the spaces between the tall, straight trunks shadowed by late afternoon sunlight.</p> <p>Hawke didn\u2019t have to be a genius to figure out what the boy planned.</p><p>\u201cHawke!\u201d</p><p>Retracting his claws, he attempted to wipe his expression clean as he turned to face a woman who was one of his most trusted friends.</p><p>And could be a royal pain in the ass.</p><p>Indigo frowned as she closed the distance between them. \u201cWas Kit here?\u201d A pause as she obviously caught a second scent. \u201cAh, Sienna\u2019s using her free hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you need me for something?\u201d He held his hand out for the datapad by her side. \u201cIs there a problem with the extended patrols?\u201d They\u2019d set up the patrols deep in the forested interior and along the isolated mountain edges of den territory, after Councilor Henry Scott\u2019s games a couple of months back\u2014games that had almost stolen the life of Indigo\u2019s mate, Drew.</p><p>Things had been quiet since then, but the pack wasn\u2019t about to drop its guard, especially when it appeared the Psy Councilors had their knives out for each other. Like it or not, the Psy were the most powerful race on the planet. If they imploded, the repercussions would make everyone bleed. \u201cIndigo, I don\u2019t have all day.\u201d Sharp words.</p><p>The lieutenant\u2019s response was to fold her arms, her namesake eyes bright with challenge. \u201cThe young males are starting to show signs of aggression. You know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d It was a statement brimming with dominance, one that would\u2019ve made almost any other individual tuck tail and run.</p><p>Indigo gave him an easy, dangerous smile. \u201cI know all you have to do is snap your fingers and women throw themselves into your bed\u2014\u201d She held up a hand when he growled. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you use your position, but the fact that you\u2019re alpha, the reason why you\u2019re alpha\u2014your strength, your speed, your sheer dominance\u2014that\u2019s potent stuff. Not to mention your pretty face.\u201d</p><p>It was a struggle to keep his focus when the back of his neck burned with the snarling awareness of what was going on not far into the forest. \u201cThanks for the pep talk.\u201d It came out wolf rough.</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d Indigo was one of only two people in the den who could say that to his face and not get herself in seriously deep shit, and she used that knowledge ruthlessly. \u201cI know damn well you could go and scratch that itch right now if you wanted to, but why don\u2019t you think about whether scratching it with just any packmate\u2014even one you like\u2014will have any effect whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>KIT halted now that they were out of range of keen changeling hearing\u2014even that of a wolf so close to his animal that his senses were more acute than normal. Because while Kit was happy to prod at Hawke, he also had a healthy respect for the SnowDancer alpha and wasn\u2019t about to push him beyond a certain point.</p><p>That fact might\u2019ve annoyed his leopard had it been another dominant male closer to his own age, but just as Kit\u2019s leopard knew its own strength, man and leopard both also knew that Hawke was a predatory changeling male in the prime of his life. The wolf alpha would wipe the floor with Kit without so much as breaking a sweat.</p><p>Sienna tugged her hand out of his. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d Curious, not angry.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say my kisses aren\u2019t nice?\u201d He couldn\u2019t resist the tease.</p><p>Folding her arms, she pinned him with one of those looks she\u2019d picked up from her mentor, Indigo. \u201cThat was the problem, as I seem to recall.\u201d</p><p>Kit\u2019s pride winced. Just a little\u2014before his leopard shrugged it off with feline confidence. \u201cWant to try again? It was only one kiss.\u201d</p><p>Shadows clouded her expression, turning her gaze to midnight. \u201cKit, I\u2014\u201d Eyes narrowing as she glimpsed the grin tugging at his lips, she mimed throwing something at his head. \u201cNot funny.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, he pulled her body against his with one arm around her neck, deeply conscious that such informal skin privileges came hard for her, that he was one of the few people she trusted in this way\u2014enough to have allowed him to spring a kiss on her. \u201cHow could I resist, Sin? You\u2019re so adorable and earnest.\u201d</p><p>She elbowed him. Hard. Wincing, he continued to hold her by his side. \u201cSo, still no chemistry, huh?\u201d He nuzzled the top of her head with his chin. \u201cPity. Because you know you\u2019re smoking hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlso not funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t a lie.\u201d He knew from the slight shake of her head that she thought he was spouting a whole boatload of shit, but the fact was, Sienna was gorgeous\u2014in a way every dominant changeling male in both packs had noticed.</p><p>Hers wasn\u2019t a delicate feminine beauty, for all that she was small and fine-boned. No, Sienna carried within her a deep, deep core of strength that had etched itself onto her face. This was a woman who would stand her ground, come what may. And to a predatory changeling male, that was both purest temptation and the most enticing challenge.</p><p>He got another intriguing glimpse of that internal strength when she pushed away to face him once more. \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI scented Hawke walking out,\u201d he said, eyes never moving off her . . . so he saw the immediate stiffening of her shoulders, the pinched tightness around the lush curves of her mouth.</p><p>When she spoke, her voice held a husky undertone that stroked over his senses like rough silk. \u201cDid he see us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Leaning against an old lodgepole pine, the trunk clear of branches high up into the canopy, he hooked his thumbs into the pockets of his jeans, thinking again that chemistry was a bitch. But disappointing as it was that there were no fireworks between him and Sienna\u2014oh, there\u2019d been sparks, sure, but not enough to satisfy either one of them\u2014he had the rock solid feeling that their friendship was here to stay. And Kit took care of his friends. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me that way.\u201d</p><p>Arms crossed over her chest once more, she pinned him with an angry stare. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t like to play games.\u201d</p><p>Yes, he did. Sienna was smart on a whole different level than the majority of people, but she\u2019d also spent most of her life in Silence. The conditioning designed to suppress her feelings, her very heart, had left her with huge gaps in her emotional education\u2014which was why she needed friends to watch her back, especially now. \u201cThere are games, and then there are strategic moves.\u201d He shook his head when she would have spoken. \u201cPredatory changelings are possessive; it\u2019s part of the package. Alphas take that to an entirely new level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t apply here.\u201d A hard angle to her jaw, those arms so defensively folded. But she didn\u2019t try to pretend she didn\u2019t know what he was talking about. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t see me as an adult female, not in that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHence my helping hand . . . or lips, as the case may be.\u201d Walking over, he tugged on her braid because not touching someone he cared about was incomprehensible to his leopard. \u201cTrust me, kitten. I know when a man wants to rip my head off.\u201d Followed by various other parts of his anatomy. \u201cHawke was ready to make leopard mincemeat of my insides and feed it to those feral wolves who follow him around like he\u2019s their alpha, too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEven if you are correct\u201d\u2014tight words, tendons pulled taut along her jaw\u2014\u201cit won\u2019t matter. He\u2019s made up his mind.\u201d</p><p>That, Kit agreed, was a problem. Because if there was one thing he knew about the wolf alpha, it was that Hawke\u2019s will was as intractable and immoveable as granite.</p><p>HAWKE finished the last of the two hundred crunches he\u2019d set for himself, and sat up. It was three a.m. and his body was still buzzed, in spite of the fact that he\u2019d been in the small indoor gym for over an hour, doing everything he could to exhaust himself. \u201cHell,\u201d he grunted.</p> <p>Getting up, he wiped off his face using a towel, then flicked on the entertainment screen on the wall, programming it to show financial reports. Cooper and Jem, in concert with a dedicated team, did the day-to-day caretaking of SnowDancer\u2019s investments, but Hawke made sure he stayed up to date as the two lieutenants often used him as a sounding board.</p><p>But today, all he saw was gibberish, his brain hazed by a sexual hunger so raw and wild, he knew he\u2019d have to take care of it or his wolf would begin to fight him, inciting a dangerous level of aggression in all the unmated males in the pack. Right now, they were edgy but the level was still manageable. If Hawke\u2019s wolf slipped the leash . . . Shoving his hands through his hair, he was about to reach for the water bottle when he heard someone enter the training room next door.</p><p>Likely one of the night-shift soldiers, he thought. Taking a long drink, he put the bottle on a nearby bench as he pushed through the connecting door into the other room, intending to ask if they\u2019d be up for a sparring session. Riley was the only one in the den who could take on Hawke at full strength and make him hurt, but Hawke often practiced with other packmates\u2014just made sure to rein his strength back a fraction.</p><p>He halted three steps into the room, the scent of autumn fire, of some rich exotic spice twining around him, as the door closed with a quiet snick at his back. She hadn\u2019t seen him, the woman dressed in black gi pants and a deep green tank top who moved with such fluid grace in the center of the room. The precise, stylized movements spoke not of combat, but of an attempt to find peace.</p><p>She\u2019d pulled her waist-length hair into a neat braid, and the dark rope gleamed with ruby red highlights. It made him feel like a cradle-robbing bastard, but he couldn\u2019t help but imagine those silken strands spread out all over his hands . . . over his pillow. Fuck. He should turn around right this second and walk out. There was a reason he made sure never to be alone with her in this kind of a mood.</p> <p>But it was too late.</p><p>She went motionless, the stance of prey scenting a predator. When she turned, it was with wary cautiousness. Not a word passed her lips, but he knew he was intruding on her allotted free hour for the day to come\u2014because whatever else she did, Sienna never lied, never tried to get out of punishment once she\u2019d broken the rules.</p><p>He should\u2019ve left. Instead, he shoved aside the voice of reason and walked to her, aware of her spine going stiff, her shoulders squaring. But it was the sheen of perspiration across her collarbones that fascinated him. The wolf wanted to lick, see if she tasted of the spice so hot and sweet in her scent.</p><p>In spite of what might have gone on in the forest earlier, the leopard cub hadn\u2019t managed to imprint his scent into her skin. It was all Sienna. Swallowing his growl of satisfaction, he reined in the primal impulse to taste, to take. \u201cYour arm,\u201d he murmured, moving to stand behind her and stroking his hand down that arm to raise it, \u201cshould be straight on that final turn. You\u2019re dropping it.\u201d</p><p>Her pulse thudded hard and fast against the delicate skin of her neck, and it was all he could do not to drop his head and bite down on it. Not to hurt. Just a nip. Just enough to leave a mark. \u201cLike this.\u201d He moved his hand along the smooth warmth of her arm until it was straight. \u201cDo you see?\u201d</p><p>No sound as she angled her head to one side. He knew she hadn\u2019t meant it to be, but it was an invitation to his wolf, the offering of that vulnerable part of her. He could close his hand around her throat, close his teeth around her jugular, anything he wanted. He was so much stronger than her that he could do that no matter what, but conquering wasn\u2019t the same as surrender. \u201cDo it again,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI want to watch.\u201d</p> <p>It took every ounce of will he had to drop her arm, to not accept the unintended invitation and take them both to the floor in a tangle of skin and heat. But he couldn\u2019t stop himself from running the knuckles of one hand down her throat as he stepped away, his gut tight, his body so damn hard he might as well have been made of steel. He moved until he was in prime position to watch her, and then he waited. She did nothing for a long, still moment, and he thought she would deny him this.</p><p>But then Sienna began to move.</p><p>And his wolf stopped pacing.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>HUNDREDS OF MILES away, in the barren heart of another continent, an Arrow named Aden scanned his gaze over a desert wasteland that was a rich rust red under sunlight, but now glimmered silver in the glow of the moon. \u201cWhy do you always come here?\u201d he asked the fellow member of the squad who\u2019d teleported him to the location.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s clarity here,\u201d Vasic said, looking out at the rolling vista of sand dunes, his eyes a piercing silver that echoed the brilliance of the moon.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here.\u201d</p><p>Vasic merely shook his head. \u201cPure Psy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA possible problem.\u201d Aden sometimes wondered if he and Vasic hadn\u2019t formed an inadvertent subconscious telepathic connection, they understood each other so effortlessly.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Vasic said with unerring accuracy, \u201cit was when we were placed in training as children. Bonds are more easily formed prior to complete Silence.\u201d</p><p>Aden preferred not to think about those days. A child was weak, simple to break. He was no longer that child. \u201cPure Psy,\u201d he said, returning to the reason for this meeting.</p><p>\u201cGutierrez and Suhana are already inside and reporting back. We may lose Abbot and Sione.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not unexpected.\u201d The two Arrows both had unstable abilities.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Aden watched as a tiny insect crawled across the sand at his feet. \u201cThe adherents of Pure Psy say they seek to preserve the integrity of Silence.\u201d The insect stumbled, turned onto its back.</p><p>Vasic righted the creature with a delicate touch of Tk, and it hurried into its burrow. \u201cWhat is said and what is done are often two different things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d More than a century ago, Zaid Adelaja had formed the Arrow Squad to watch over Silence, to ensure it would never fall and shatter the PsyNet. But now . . . \u201cWe will have to make a choice soon.\u201d</p><p>Going down on his haunches, Vasic picked up a handful of sand, the silica catching the moonlight as it passed through his fingers. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>What neither of them said was that it was a choice that might well change the face of the PsyNet forever.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>THE INDULGENCE OF the previous night came back to bite Hawke the next morning. His wolf had had a taste of Sienna Lauren, and it was through with waiting. It wanted her, and it wanted her now. The scent of her\u2014the maddening spice and steel of it\u2014lingered in his skin until he drew it in with every breath.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t allow himself to surrender to the compulsion. Everything else aside, she was nineteen years old, for Christ\u2019s sake, nowhere near mature enough to handle either man or wolf, especially given the razor\u2019s edge he was walking right now. More than likely, he\u2019d terrify her.</p><p>His jaw tightened.</p><p>Making a decision, he packed up some gear and strode down to the underground garage where SnowDancer stored its vehicles. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in two weeks,\u201d he told Riley when the lieutenant met him beside the camo green all-wheel-drive. \u201cI\u2019m going to head up to the mountains, make sure we haven\u2019t missed any vulnerable spots along the perimeter.\u201d</p><p>It was a legitimate way to burn off his frustration, especially given the extra patrols they\u2019d been running in that region. Riley would simply switch Hawke in for one of the other soldiers and reassign their packmate a task closer to the den\u2014no one would complain since the mountain shifts tended to be quiet and lonely. \u201cHold the fort.\u201d His unflinching trust in his lieutenants was the only reason he could consider being out of the den for such an extended period.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I always?\u201d Riley folded his arms, those dark brown eyes watching Hawke with a patient calm that did nothing to hide the incisive mind behind them. \u201cYou have your sat phone in case we need you?\u201d</p><p>Hawke held it up. Nothing would keep him from returning to the den if called, whether through technology or through the music of a wolf\u2019s howl.</p><p>Riley pulled a small datapad out of his pocket. \u201cI\u2019m promoting Tai from senior novice status to full soldier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a feeling.\u201d The young male had gained a maturity this year that would hold him in good stead when it came to his new responsibilities. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure to speak to him when I get back.\u201d</p><p>A nod. \u201cAs for Maria\u2014she\u2019ll be on supervised shifts after she\u2019s out of confinement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSienna\u2019s going to be spoiling for a fight when her punishment is done.\u201d</p><p>Hawke dumped his gear in the truck with more force than necessary. \u201cNo more long leash for her, Riley. She steps out of line, slap her back into it.\u201d</p><p>His most senior lieutenant, his friend, raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou know what I said about taking you down if you so much as looked at her?\u201d A reminder that both Riley and Drew considered Sienna family and thus theirs to protect. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll still beat you bloody if you hurt her, but I won\u2019t stand in your way if you want to court her\u2014she\u2019s no longer as vulnerable as she was back then.\u201d</p><p>Getting into the driver\u2019s seat, Hawke brought up the manual steering wheel and reached back to slide the door closed, his actions rough with the wolf\u2019s fury at being denied. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He couldn\u2019t let it matter. Not and live with himself. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Riley braced his arms on the door\u2019s window frame, his expression as relaxed as if they were talking about the most mundane den matter . . . except for his eyes. Those eyes, they saw everything. \u201cThen why the hell are you about to drive up into the most godforsaken corner of den territory and go lone wolf?\u201d</p><p>He started the engine. \u201cYou know why. I need to run it off.\u201d Hawke knew full well that he could seduce Sienna, and not only that, that he could make her enjoy it\u2014it wasn\u2019t arrogance but simple fact. The sexual attraction between them wasn\u2019t in question. Her skin had burned with the heat of it last night, her pulse a thudding erotic beat he\u2019d hungered to trace across every intimate inch of her body. Add his experience to that, and he had not a single doubt in his mind that he could bring Sienna Lauren sweetly into his bed, take what both man and wolf craved until it was no longer a claw tearing at his gut.</p><p>His hands flexed on the wheel at the idea of it, his mind cascading with images of limbs intertwined on tangled sheets, her skin a smooth cream kissed by gold against his darker flesh. But that was where those images would remain\u2014locked within his mind. Because he was no lover for an innocent who didn\u2019t understand the sheer depth of the demands he\u2019d make on her . . . even knowing he could never give her the bond that would make up for the raw intensity of all he\u2019d take.</p> <p>SIENNA scrubbed the large pot used in the communal kitchen that fed most of the unmated adult wolves in the den, her energetic movements driven by aggravation. \u201cWe have high-tech abilities,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhy do we need to blacken pots?\u201d Three days into the third week of her punishment and she was building serious muscle from the hard labor.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d Tai said from beside her, where he was stacking plates, \u201csome things only taste right when cooked in a pot. So says Aisha and her word is law.\u201d Unlike her, Tai wasn\u2019t in trouble, simply doing his shift in the kitchens, which was why he was so annoyingly cheerful.</p><p>\u201cFour more days and I\u2019m free,\u201d she said under her breath, focusing on the manual task in an effort to fight the memory of Hawke\u2019s hands on her skin, his breath so hot against her temple, her neck.</p><p>She\u2019d spent the day following their encounter in a knot of anticipation . . . only to find that he\u2019d left the den. Her hands moved harder on the pot, the force of it turning the scourer black. She wasn\u2019t wolf, but she understood exactly what he was doing. That night in the training room would not be repeated\u2014he\u2019d have considered it a lapse of judgment on his part, conduct unbecoming an alpha. Sienna Lauren was not a suitable lover for the man who was the heart of SnowDancer.</p><p>Her knuckles scraped against the inside of the pot, but she hardly noticed, her chest ached from so deep within. Once, the intensity of her response would have set off a wave of dissonance, shards of agony designed to remind her of the need to maintain Silence, but Judd had helped her remove the final emotion triggers six months ago.</p> <p>Sienna had resisted taking that step for almost a year\u2014since Judd first worked out how to disable the pain protocols. The only reason she\u2019d finally agreed to the removal had been because of the increasing strength of the dissonance. There had been a risk it could begin to cause permanent and irreversible brain injury. Now Sienna was free to feel everything . . . including the bone-deep terror that the X-marker might yet make her a mass murderer.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d A nudge from Tai.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked, rinsing off the pot.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t take it so hard, you know.\u201d His muscled body was warm against hers as he leaned into her for a second. \u201cI got busted off my sentry duties one time after I did something stupid. It happens.\u201d</p><p>Touched by his attempt to make her feel better, she pushed away the knot of frustrated anger, which never seemed to go away. \u201cI heard you went out with Evie again.\u201d Putting the pot on the drying board, she started on the next one.</p><p>Tai pushed himself up to perch on the counter, long legs almost touching the floor. His shoulders had filled out in the past year, and he had, she realized, become a big man, almost as big as Hawke\u2014</p> <p>No. She would not think about him. He certainly hadn\u2019t had any problem walking away from her. \u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you tell anyone I admitted this,\u201d Tai said, \u201cI\u2019ll call you a liar without any compunction whatsoever.\u201d Throwing the dish towel over his shoulder, he pinned her with a scowl that did nothing to detract from the exotic lines of his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good at keeping secrets.\u201d It was a survival skill. No one, she\u2019d realized at an early age, wanted to know a monster.</p><p>\u201cI want to write goddamn poetry to her\u201d\u2014Tai\u2019s embarrassed voice, breaking into her thoughts\u2014\u201cfucking serenade her and steal a kiss under moonlight, cover her room in candlelight just to see her smile, hold her all night long so I can breathe in her scent as I wake.\u201d</p><p>Sienna\u2019s hands had stopped moving with his first startling statement. \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Her heart pulsed with a fragile need she hadn\u2019t even known she had until that moment.</p><p>Tai\u2019s slightly uptilted eyes were sheepish when he said, \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Swallowing the strange, incomprehensible softness inside of her, she added, \u201cMaybe not all of it at once, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I survive Indigo,\u201d Tai muttered. \u201cShe\u2019s so freaking protective, it\u2019s like running a gauntlet each time I dare ask Evie out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCan you blame her? Evie\u2019s so gentle.\u201d Sienna had been certain Evie would be horrified by her when Indigo insisted on introducing Sienna to her sister\u2014but in spite of her too-kind heart, Evie had a well-hidden streak of mischief. It had made them fast friends and, once upon a time, accomplices in some of the most spectacular stunts ever pulled in the den.</p><p>Tai nodded. \u201cI think that pot\u2019s done.\u201d</p><p>Handing it over so he could dry and put it away, she wiped down the sink and made a quick getaway. It wasn\u2019t until she was outside in the dark green shadow of the forest giants that she realized how much she\u2019d missed the crisp air of the Sierra during her hours in the kitchens. Before defecting to SnowDancer, she\u2019d spent her days inside high-rise buildings, in the middle of a city, and known no different. Now she\u2019d tasted not only the wild, rugged beauty of the mountains, but learned what it was to have friends, to have family in more than just blood.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made my decision,\u201d she said to the man who\u2019d come to stand beside her with an assassin\u2019s quiet grace. \u201cNo matter what, I won\u2019t return to the PsyNet, to Silence.\u201d It had been an option she\u2019d been forced to consider when it appeared her abilities were spiraling out into chaos and destruction.</p><p>\u201cHow good,\u201d Judd said instead of responding to her statement, \u201cis your control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrong as steel.\u201d Her time away from the den, in the care of other defectors, including one who was a genius at shield construction, had given her a second chance. She would never forget the death that lived within her, but\u2014\u201cI\u2019m going to make it, Judd. I\u2019m going to spit in the face of that bastard who sentenced us all to die.\u201d</p><p>Judd said nothing to strike at Sienna\u2019s confidence, aware she\u2019d need every ounce of it if she was going to survive the coming darkness\u2014because he knew something she didn\u2019t. It was a truth he\u2019d carried in his heart for years, a truth he would never, ever share with her. To do so might well turn it into a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>He\u2019d hacked into secret Council archives when Sienna had been ten, helped by fellow Arrows who\u2019d understood that his niece might one day end up in the squad. Only he had read the files that went back 150 years, and so only he knew the brutal facts: The longest any X-Psy had ever survived, even under Silence, was to age twenty-five.</p><p>That twenty-five-year-old X had registered as 3.4 on the Gradient.</p><p>Sienna was off the charts.</p><p>HAWKE had spent his first week in the mountains avoiding contact with even the sentries. He\u2019d known he wasn\u2019t fit company for anyone. The feral wolves, too, had given him a wide berth after he snarled at them . . . though they still came to huddle around him at night, all of them sleeping in a big pile of fur. It was difficult to maintain a bad temper in the face of such fierce affection, but Hawke\u2019s wolf was riding him hard.</p><p>The dreams sure as hell didn\u2019t help.</p><p>Ruby red fire and smooth sun gold skin; autumn and that rare, wild spice. The echoes of her haunted him until he couldn\u2019t close his eyes without it whispering over his senses, a fleeting silken touch.</p><p>So vivid were the dreams that he woke hard as stone and furious with himself for his lack of control. As a result, he was leaner and feeling a hell of a lot meaner when he returned to the den. He\u2019d run himself to exhaustion, and though his wolf was behaving, he knew it would take only the slightest provocation, the slightest touch, to send him over the edge. And still, he had to fight the compulsion to track her down, make sure she knew he was back. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Throwing his gear on the floor of his bedroom, he\u2019d pulled off his T-shirt in preparation for a shower when he scented a familiar female. Snarling, he stalked to the door and wrenched it open. \u201cNot a word,\u201d he snapped at Indigo.</p><p>Freshly showered and dressed in jeans teamed with a plain white T-shirt, her hair pulled back in a ponytail, Indigo favored him with a slow smile before running her eyes down his body, up again. \u201cI guess that whole not sleeping thing has its advantages.\u201d</p><p>Hawke bared his teeth. \u201cGo gawk at your mate.\u201d</p><p>A snort. \u201cIf Drew was here, do you think you\u2019d rate a glance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will\u2014after I get what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d Indigo shifted to glance down the corridor. \u201cHere she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Yuki said, neat and pressed in a suit that told him she was heading to work. \u201cThought we were meeting in your office.\u201d Reaching into her satchel, she withdrew a printed form attached to a clipboard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Indigo took it, shoved it at him. \u201cI decided to beard the rabid wolf in his den.\u201d</p><p>Growling, Hawke grabbed the pen. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, signing without reading. That was a trust reserved for the lieutenants. If it got to a point where he didn\u2019t have total faith in them, then the pack was in serious trouble. That had happened only once in their history, and Hawke was determined to never let those painful events taint the relationship he had with his men and women. \u201cDon\u2019t usually need a lawyer to witness things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo for this,\u201d Indigo said, scrawling her name beside his, then handing Yuki the pen so she could follow suit. \u201cIt gives Riley power of attorney over your worldly goods in exigent circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>He looked up. \u201cIndigo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. It also gives him the right to make life-or-death decisions on your behalf should events warrant it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when is that necessary in a pack?\u201d Pack was one. Pack was family.</p><p>\u201cSince Judd pointed out that if you get incapacitated,\u201d Yuki said with a frown, \u201cit\u2019d make things a lot less complicated if we had the legal papers. Otherwise, anyone who wanted to undermine the pack could use the opportunity to throw roadblocks in our path. I\u2019m annoyed I didn\u2019t think of it myself.\u201d</p><p>Hawke had to agree it made sense. Especially since . . . Oh. \u201cIt\u2019s because I have no next of kin.\u201d No parents. No siblings. No mate.</p> <p>Yuki shot him a sharp glance, an abrupt reminder that Elias\u2019s loyal mate and Sakura\u2019s loving mother was also a pit-bull for her biggest and most demanding client\u2014the SnowDancer pack. \u201cI\u2019d rather we never had to use these papers, so don\u2019t get hurt.\u201d Putting the clipboard and its contents back into her bag, she looked at her watch, her glossy black hair swinging to brush her jaw. \u201cHave to run, got a meeting in Sacramento.\u201d The last words were called out over her shoulder as she left.</p><p>\u201cI second everything Yuki said.\u201d Indigo leaned forward as if to embrace him. When he stepped back without meaning to, she narrowed her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re in a shitload of trouble if you don\u2019t trust yourself to touch a packmate in whom you have no sexual interest whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d take care of it.\u201d</p><p>Realization had her lips flattening into a thin line. \u201cDamn it, Hawke.\u201d Arms folded, she shook her head. \u201cI know what you\u2019re planning, that you think you\u2019re protecting her\u2014but you do this and Sienna will never forgive you. You sure you want to end any chance the two of you might have?\u201d</p><p>He caught her gaze, allowing the wolf\u2019s dominance out to play. She held it longer than anyone else aside from Riley could have.</p><p>\u201cDamn it.\u201d Blinking as she looked away, she sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re a stubborn bastard, you know that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am who I am.\u201d And what he was, was a man who needed to satiate his sexual hunger before his wolf took the decision out of his hands. Because that wolf would track only one scent.</p><p>RECOVERED FROM COMPUTER 2(A) TAGS: PERSONAL CORRESPONDENCE, FATHER, ACTION NOT REQUIRED</p><p>FROM: Alice &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>TO: Dad &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p> <p>DATE: March 16th, 1971 at 10:13pm</p><p>SUBJECT: re: Your Mother</p><p>Dear Dad,</p><p>Tell Mom the reason I never e-mail her is because she gets the phone calls.

You and Mom know me too well.</p><p>You were asking about my new project. I\u2019ve barely begun and while my Psy colleagues have agreed to publicize my call for information on the PsyNet, I\u2019ve already hit the first hurdle\u2014the sheer rarity of X-Psy. I only have two signed up to participate so far, but I\u2019m not giving up. That isn\u2019t the Eldridge way.</p><p>Say hello to the pharaohs for me.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Alice</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>\u201cI KNOW HE\u2019D chew me up and spit me out, but God, it\u2019s all I can do not to strip myself naked and beg for him to bite me any way and anywhere he wants.\u201d</p><p>Overhearing that heartfelt feminine sentiment, Sienna dropped her fourth dish of the day. The chief cook, Aisha, raised a hand and pointed, banishing her to the sinks. She went without argument\u2014scrubbing the hated pots was all she\u2019d been good for since the moment she\u2019d learned of Hawke\u2019s return, her brain scrambled like the eggs Marlee and Toby loved to eat on Sunday mornings.</p><p>As if she\u2019d conjured him up by thinking of him, her brother appeared at her elbow. \u201cWow, that\u2019s a big pot, Sienna.\u201d</p><p>Deep warmth spread through her veins. For Toby, she\u2019d do anything. Born with a slight empathic gift, he was goodness, was heart. He made her want to be good, too\u2014even though she knew that to be an impossible goal. X-Psy were born for, and useful for, only one thing.</p><p>Destruction.</p><p>A hand on her forearm. \u201cSienna.\u201d</p><p>Dropping the pot, she bent to wrap her soapy arms around that gangly preteen body that was no longer that of the child she\u2019d tickled into bed just last year. \u201cHow do you always know?\u201d she whispered into his hair.</p><p>His arms locked around her neck. \u201cI can see you in our net,\u201d he said, speaking of the psychic network that tied all the members of the family to each other. It provided the biofeedback needed by their Psy minds, was what had kept them alive when they\u2019d defected from the sprawling vastness of the PsyNet. \u201cYour mind goes all icy.\u201d</p><p>She heard the fear in his tone. Any time she got \u201cicy,\u201d as he put it, Toby got afraid. Because he understood what she was on an instinctive level that meant she\u2019d never been able to protect him from the harsh truth\u2014Toby saw the monster within and still he loved her, still he needed her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go back to the Net, Sienna.\u201d A plea. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t, Toby. I won\u2019t.\u201d Her earlier intent solidified into stone. If, in spite of everything, she failed to contain her ability, then she would, as Councilor Ming LeBon had once put it, take herself \u201cout of the equation.\u201d Her death would hurt Toby, but it wouldn\u2019t savage him\u2014not like if he had to watch her turn cold, a Silent stranger who rejected his love as if it was a worthless token. I love you, Toby. A telepathic communication between siblings, as easy as a breath.</p><p>I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re my sister, Sienna.</p><p>They held the embrace a long time. Though Aisha ran a tight ship, she didn\u2019t tell Sienna to get a move on. Aisha\u2019s eyes smiled when she glimpsed them\u2014the wolves understood touch, understood affection. They couldn\u2019t know how much it meant to Sienna that she could openly hold the boy who was a living, breathing piece of her heart.</p><p>Since the moment of his birth, she\u2019d had to hide, had to bury everything she felt when it came to Toby. If Ming had discovered the searing depth of a love that had defied Silence itself, the bastard wouldn\u2019t have done anything to her. She\u2019d been too important. But he might well have ended Toby\u2019s life to \u201csafeguard\u201d Sienna\u2019s Silence.</p><p>She would\u2019ve killed him for it, of course.</p><p>Hiding that dark thought in a secret corner of her mind where Toby would never sense it, she drew back and brushed his hair out of his eyes as she had a habit of doing. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in school?\u201d Toby attended the small internal school for ages five to thirteen\u2014the older teenagers generally went to a high school outside den territory, except for a few who\u2019d chosen distance learning.</p><p>\u201cWe got the afternoon off today\u2019cause the teachers got a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby, your grammar is atrocious.\u201d His enunciation and grammar had been PsyNet perfect when they defected\u2014she much preferred him this way.</p><p>\u201cAw, Sienna.\u201d Two kisses, one on each cheek. \u201cCan you help me with my homework after you get out of the kitchen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She rose back up to her full height. \u201cWhat subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScience. I have to build a volcano.\u201d Cardinal eyes gleamed. \u201cIt\u2019s going to explode and everything.\u201d</p><p>Her hand clenched on the scourer she\u2019d just picked up. \u201cWow.\u201d Forcing her fingers to relax, she nodded to the fruit bowl. \u201cEat an apple. It\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p><p>Toby made a face but obeyed. \u201cCan\u2019t I have a cookie instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbuse.\u201d But he was smiling as he bit into the shiny red fruit, the smile turning into a grin when Aisha slipped him a palm-sized oatmeal raisin cookie.</p><p>\u201cFinish the apple first,\u201d the cook ordered, tousling his hair.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Aisha,\u201d Toby said before looking back at Sienna, his eyes sparkling in a way that would\u2019ve startled her if she hadn\u2019t seen Sascha Duncan\u2019s eyes do the same thing. Because the stars were no longer white. Not quite. It was as if Toby\u2019s eyes shimmered with color . . . with life.</p><p>Sometimes, Sienna thought Toby had been sent into the world to balance the scales, an antidote to the sister who loved him to the depths of her soul, but who could create only pain, only suffering, only horror.</p><p>HAWKE blocked Elias\u2019s kick and put the senior soldier on his back. \u201cDamn it, Eli. You\u2019re leaving yourself wide open.\u201d</p><p>Elias lay on the ground, chest heaving. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not. You\u2019re just not pulling any punches.\u201d He winced. \u201cI\u2019m going to set Yuki on you\u2014she doesn\u2019t like it when you beat me up.\u201d</p><p>Unamused, Hawke waited as the other man rolled to his feet. \u201cYou said you wanted to spar so you could figure out what you needed to work on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI take it back.\u201d Elias braced himself with his hands on his knees. \u201cThe single person who can spar with you in this kind of a mood is Riley.\u201d Rising fully, he shoved a hand through dark brown hair damp with sweat. \u201cI need to give you my report anyway.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf was tensed and ready for action, but he drew in a long, deep breath, brought the animal under control. \u201cProblems in the city?\u201d DarkRiver and SnowDancer had both kept a constant and visible presence in San Francisco ever since the attempted bombings the previous year. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI dunno.\u201d Elias rubbed his jaw. \u201cThe leopards always get the best intel, so you should liaise with them, but my instincts are itching. I can\u2019t quite put a finger on it\u2014the thing is, you know we\u2019ve got more than the usual number of Psy coming into the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Side effect of Nikita deciding she no longer supports Silence.\u201d Not out of the goodness of her heart, but simply because it made the most political sense. Sascha\u2019s mother was one cold bitch. \u201cThey causing trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, quiet as church mice.\u201d Elias fell into step beside him as Hawke began to make his way to the training run. The obstacle course would give him a much-needed physical outlet before he headed inside to talk to Tom\u00e1s about a couple of people Hawke wanted to send to the lieutenant for training.</p> <p>\u201cBut with so many of them coming in,\u201d Elias continued, \u201cit\u2019s hard to pinpoint the friendlies from the others.\u201d</p><p>Hawke had raised the same concern with Lucas not long ago. \u201cThe Rats,\u201d he said, referring to the small changeling group that ran a very effective spy network, \u201cknow to keep an eye out for any unusual Psy activity, but I\u2019ll have Luc talk to them, have them amp up their efforts.\u201d He trusted Elias\u2019s instincts. The soldier was one of his most capable men, not dominant enough to be a lieutenant, but smart and experienced\u2014and more important, he had a head as stable as Riley\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Elias looked at the training run, blew out a breath. \u201cJesus, Riaz is a sadist. What the hell are those spike things? They weren\u2019t there last time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime me.\u201d Hawke\u2019s wolf bared its teeth in anticipation. Riaz had outdone himself this time. As Hawke ran up the first incline, he hoped like hell that Elias\u2019s gut was wrong for once, but given the events of the past few months\u2014and the fact that every F-Psy on the planet was apparently forecasting war\u2014he knew that to be a bleak hope.</p><p>WALKER went to retie the ribbon around his daughter\u2019s ponytail, playing a game with her on the LaurenNet as he did so. She was fascinated by the unusual twisting motion at the center of the mental star that was his mind, and kept getting distracted.</p> <p>He\u2019d been something of a puzzle to the staff at the Psy-Med hospital, too. No one had ever been able to explain the reason for the odd moving helix that had become apparent long after he was past childhood. There had been discussions about studying it further, but when it became clear the twist neither detracted from, nor added any strength to his already strong telepathic range, the issue was put aside.</p><p>It had, however, proven an excellent gauge of a child\u2019s psychic development\u2014to the extent that Walker had come to believe that to be the reason for it. Since his telepathic touch worked particularly well with the young and the helix had developed soon after he began teaching, it made sense. As it was, while Toby had matured to the point where he could ignore the distraction of the motion, Marlee hadn\u2019t.</p><p>Almost, he encouraged on the psychic plane as the ribbon slipped out of his grasp on the physical. Picking it up, he said, \u201cYou know I\u2019m not good at this.\u201d His hands were too big, too clumsy for such a delicate task. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ask Sienna?\u201d</p><p>Waiting until he finished and moved around to crouch in front of her, she wrapped an arm around his neck. \u201cI like it when you do it.\u201d A wide smile.</p><p>In the three years since their family had defected from the PsyNet, Walker had learned many things\u2014how to live in a world without Silence, how to manage the dominance challenges within a wolf pack, how to look after Marlee and Toby in a way for which he had no template. But the one thing he still hadn\u2019t learned was how to handle the overload of emotion caused by his daughter\u2019s smile.</p><p>When she threw both arms around his neck in a spontaneous embrace, it only caused the tightness in his chest to grow\u2014until it filled every part of him. Wrapping his own arms around her, he rose to his feet. She made a startled sound. \u201cI\u2019m too big!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll always be my child.\u201d He wished he could say the soft, sweet words he heard changeling parents say constantly to their children, but he\u2019d been an inmate of Silence for four long decades. The words were hard to form, to get out. But it was incredibly easy to lift his hand, to stroke away the baby-fine strands of hair that had escaped Marlee\u2019s ponytail, to press a kiss to her temple.</p><p>When she said, \u201cCan we go see if Toby\u2019s volcano is ready?\u201d he could no more deny her than he could stop breathing.</p><p>It was another punch to the heart to walk into the large rec room near the family quarters to see Toby and Sienna with their heads bent together over a lopsided volcano. This, he thought as Marlee wiggled out of his arms to join her cousins, all of them frowning over the lack of symmetry, this was why he\u2019d survived defection from the PsyNet.</p><p>To watch over his daughter and the son of a sister he\u2019d never been allowed to love. And Sienna, too, for all that she\u2019d been forced to be an adult before she\u2019d ever been a child. They were his reason for being, for existing. As for the kiss that had threatened to make him forget the rest of the world for one blinding, pleasure-drunk moment . . . he\u2019d made the right decision.</p><p>Even if the sensations from that single searing contact continued to haunt him two long months later.</p><p>HAWKE stared at Matthias\u2019s face on the comm screen the next morning. \u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the lieutenant answered. \u201cDefinite indications of weapons coming into the country on a large scale. They\u2019ve been doing it bit by bit\u2014I\u2019m guessing some of it has been teleported in. But they\u2019ve also been bringing in armaments via ship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny idea who?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll check with Nikita and Anthony.\u201d It was odd to say that, odder yet to know that SnowDancer had any kind of a working relationship with two members of the Psy Council. \u201cAny reason why I shouldn\u2019t share this with the cats?\u201d The SnowDancer-DarkRiver alliance was all but cemented in stone; however, they were still two predatory changeling packs. Total, unquestioning trust would take decades.</p><p>\u201cNo. They have good contacts, better than we do in the city.\u201d Matthias frowned. \u201cI think you should also tell the falcons to keep an eye out\u2014they see things from up high that we might not.\u201d</p><p>Hawke agreed. The alliance with WindHaven was new but very much functional. \u201cSend me the details. I\u2019ll have a look and pass on the necessary info.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have it in the next couple of hours.\u201d Matthias went to sign off, then paused. \u201cHow\u2019re Indigo and the young pup?\u201d</p><p>The \u201cyoung pup,\u201d Drew, was Hawke\u2019s eyes and ears in the pack, as well as SnowDancer\u2019s tracker. \u201cI caught them in a storage closet not long ago. They weren\u2019t exactly looking for supplies.\u201d His wolf bared its teeth in amusement.</p><p>Matthias howled with laughter. \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking try to convince me you didn\u2019t scent what was going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was very discreet.\u201d Hawke grinned. \u201cI just opened the door a crack and asked them to keep it down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd got a mop thrown at your head, I bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it was a giant roll of thread\u2014mending supplies closet.\u201d Shaking his head, he answered the question more seriously. \u201cTheir mating, added to Riley and Mercy\u2019s, Cooper\u2019s with Grace, and Judd\u2019s with Brenna, is good, really good for the stability of the pack.\u201d Having his lieutenants in such strong pairings soothed his wolf\u2019s frustration at not being able to give SnowDancer the security of a mated alpha pair.</p><p>\u201cYeah, everyone\u2019s more settled.\u201d Matthias leaned back a little. \u201cI might head down to the den sometime next month. That work?\u201d</p><p>Hawke nodded\u2014all his lieutenants passed through the den at least once every couple of months, to ensure the pack stayed connected in spite of the massive breadth of their territory. \u201cHave you spoken to Alexei lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou caught that, did you? Told him you would.\u201d Matthias\u2019s expression was wry. \u201cHe\u2019s fine, just frustrated at the recent dominance challenges from out-of-towners.\u201d</p><p>Unfortunately for Alexei, he had the face of a young golden god. People who didn\u2019t know him had a tendency to focus on that face and ignore the fact that his dominance was a quiet, powerful pulse beneath the skin. \u201cAnything I need to discuss with the other alphas?\u201d Dominance challenges between packs happened every so often, mostly when a strong wolf was seeking to create a new pack or searching for a mate, but poor Alexei tended to bear the brunt of them.</p><p>\u201cNaw.\u201d Matthias shook his head, dark hair catching the light. \u201cOur Russian Bridegroom wipes the floor with the idiots\u2014then ropes them in as senior soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe know you call him that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like a moron? Alexei might be pretty, but he\u2019s also a mean sucker.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Hawke ended the call after a few more quick words. His wolf had been prowling beneath his skin the entire time, if not content, then at least not snarling. Now, it urged him to get outside, to shift and run through the wild heart of SnowDancer territory. Hawke growled low in his throat, fighting the instinct.</p><p>The wolf pushed. The human held firm. However, the strength of the urge made it plain he could no longer avoid taking this step\u2014he had to do something about his sexual hunger before the primal part of him seized total control. Picking up the phone, he made a call.</p><p>\u201cHello.\u201d A husky female voice.</p><p>\u201cRosalie, it\u2019s Hawke.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>HAVING SERVED THE last hour of her punishment doing the evening shift in the kitchens, Sienna took ten minutes in the night air before walking back inside to the apartment she shared with Walker and the kids. Her uncle had just sent Toby to bed when she arrived, so she ducked in to say good night, peeking in at an already fast asleep Marlee as well, the younger girl\u2019s bedtime being earlier.</p><p>However, that took a bare few minutes, and she was alone in her room all too soon. The instant she was, the thoughts she\u2019d been avoiding all day crashed down on her with the violence of a Sierra thunderstorm. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d tried not to listen, not to hear, but she knew Hawke had been seen in the company of the luscious, sexy, and experienced Rosalie both yesterday and today. The wolves\u2019 penchant for gossip being what it was, she also knew conflicting schedules meant he probably hadn\u2019t been to bed with her yet . . . but it wasn\u2019t likely to be long before he did. Perhaps even tonight.</p><p>Raw, dark power rippled through her body, gathering in her fingertips. An instant\u2019s loss of control and she\u2019d destroy this wall, collapse the ceiling. Gritting her teeth, she fought the fury that made her an X, a fury that whispered that Rosalie and her ilk were nothing, would crumble to dust in the face of the deadly strength that had once made Sienna so very, very valuable to Ming. It was a horrible thought, and it brought her back.</p><p>So did the pain.</p> <p>Brutal and blinding.</p><p>She could still taste the shock that had rippled through Judd\u2019s telepathic touch when they\u2019d first discovered the second intricate level of dissonance programming. But that hidden knife blade of pain had made perfect sense to Sienna\u2014it wasn\u2019t tied to emotion and had nothing to do with Silence except in that the mechanism had been developed as a result of the Protocol. Instead, this level of dissonance only kicked in when her X abilities triggered without her conscious awareness, a blaring warning that she was about to go active.</p><p>Now, the spike of agony down her spine had her close to blanking out, white dots floating in her vision. She rode the razor\u2019s edge, allowing the dissonance to dig in its vicious claws until she staggered and brought herself back to her room in the family quarters . . . a room she\u2019d hung with Toby\u2019s graphic art and Marlee\u2019s watercolor paintings.</p><p>Nausea curdled her stomach, bile burning the back of her throat. She was moving to throw clothes and personal items into a duffel even as her body continued to tremble with the aftereffects of the dissonance\u2014she had faith in her ability to control her \u201cgift,\u201d but she was still an X. Mistakes happened.</p><p>Walker was sitting at the dining table, making notes on a datapad when she came out. \u201cGoing somewhere?\u201d Cool green eyes held her to the spot.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m moving to my quarters in the soldiers section on a permanent basis.\u201d Her fingers clenched on the canvas handles of the bag. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Toby and Marlee tomorrow, explain.\u201d The words hurt coming out, emotion a rock in her throat.</p><p>Walker rose to his feet. \u201cThey\u2019ll be fine. They understand your position in the pack.\u201d He didn\u2019t ask the question, but she felt compelled to answer anyway. That was the thing with Walker\u2014he wasn\u2019t her father, had never tried to take that role, but he was, to all intents and purposes, the patriarch of the Lauren family.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m emotionally unstable and it\u2019s affecting my psychic control,\u201d she admitted, a cold sweat breaking out along her spine. \u201cIf I suffer a shield breach, I don\u2019t want to be anywhere near where I could hurt them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you need to return to DarkRiver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Distance wasn\u2019t going to do it any longer\u2014not when she\u2019d be thinking about Hawke the entire time anyway. At least here, she\u2019d know as soon as he took Rosalie to his bed, not spend her days with the possibility eating away at her insides as she waited for it to be confirmed. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSienna,\u201d Walker said when she was almost to the door, \u201cyou\u2019re not alone. Never forget that.\u201d</p> <p>She nodded, but as she headed down the corridors toward the area of the den set aside for unmated soldiers, she knew the words for a lie. She was alone in a way none of her family could understand.</p><p>Sienna Lauren.</p><p>Designation: X.</p><p>Rating on the Gradient: Cardinal.</p><p>She was, in fact, the only cardinal X ever to survive to adulthood according to the records in the PsyNet. Perhaps the only cardinal X ever to have been born. The mutation was rare\u2014so rare that she hadn\u2019t been properly classified until she was five.</p><p>She\u2019d almost killed her mother that day.</p><p>Dropping the duffel on the bed when she reached her quarters, she shoved the unbearable memory to the darkest recesses of her mind and sat cross-legged on the floor to do mental exercises designed to wrench her abilities back under the strictest control. An hour later, her T-shirt was plastered to her body, her hair sticking to her face, but she\u2019d safely corralled the raging ferocity of her power.</p><p>It was as she was stepping out of the shower that she got the call and invite. \u201cI\u2019m in,\u201d she said, because staying here with the gnawing cruelty of her own thoughts was not an option.</p> <p>Hanging up, she pulled on some panties before beginning to rummage through her clothes\u2014both what she\u2019d carried over in the duffel and the things she\u2019d stored in the closet here, most of them items she rarely wore. First, skintight jeans. They were all but painted onto her body by the time she managed to twist, shimmy, and curse her way into them\u2014she\u2019d never have bought them on her own, but one of the leopards near her own age, Nicki, had dragged her along on a shopping expedition not long ago.</p><p>Sienna had glanced down at the plain jeans and gray sweatshirt she\u2019d been wearing at the time. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the way I dress?\u201d</p><p>The petite honey blonde\u2019s response had been a despairing shake of the head. \u201cIt says you\u2019re two hundred and counting.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes, Sienna felt exactly that, but that day, she\u2019d given in to Nicki and gone wild. Kit had whistled the first time he\u2019d seen her in the jeans, while Cory had fallen to his knees, hand over his heart. Sienna hadn\u2019t yet worn them around the wolves . . . around Hawke, but her pride wouldn\u2019t allow her to sit in her room while he put those strong hands all over another woman.</p><p>Her own hands fisted. No. No. No.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t hers, had made it clear in a hundred different ways that he didn\u2019t want to be hers. Fine.</p><p>Jeans on, she clipped on a red satin bra edged with white lace\u2014one that plumped up her chest in a way that had had her arguing with Nicki in the dressing room. \u201cI can\u2019t wear this. It\u2019s like I\u2019m advertising!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie, if I had ta-tas like that, I\u2019d advertise, too.\u201d Nicki had looked down at her own smaller breasts with a mournful sigh.</p><p>\u201cJase seems to like yours fine.\u201d</p><p>A peach-colored blush. \u201cNow, tops. Come on.\u201d</p><p>Sienna pulled out one of the resulting purchases and slipped it on. A black shirt with long sleeves, it fit snug to her body and made it unmistakable that she had curves. The buttons were snaps of pounded metal, the only other decoration two tiny black pockets with the same type of buttons above her breasts. While she didn\u2019t usually wear things that followed her shape with such caressing closeness, she had to admit she liked the way the shirt made her feel.</p><p>Sexy.</p><p>Then there were the boots. Slick and black, they encased her legs to the knees, the heels wickedly spiked.</p><p>Her cell phone beeped as she was zipping up the second boot. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSin, it\u2019s Evie. You ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost.\u201d She paused. \u201cWe are getting dressed up, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! I\u2019m wearing my silver dress.\u201d</p><p>Evie\u2019s enthusiasm had Sienna setting her jaw, determination arcing through her veins. \u201cThat dress will get you arrested.\u201d</p><p>Her best friend laughed. \u201cYou know you\u2019d bail me out. See you in ten!\u201d</p><p>Hanging up, Sienna quickly put in her special contacts, hiding the night-sky gaze that betrayed her identity, then pulled her hair back into a tight ponytail. She\u2019d spoken to Indigo and her own family about her hair, and everyone had agreed the unusual color was no longer an issue, it had changed so much since she\u2019d joined the den. Added to the fact that her friends had taken to calling her \u201cSin,\u201d plus the contacts, it turned her into someone Ming LeBon wouldn\u2019t even consider worthy of his attention.</p><p>That done, she pulled out the cosmetics case Judd\u2019s mate, Brenna, had given her, making up her eyes in a \u201csmoky\u201d way she\u2019d learned from Indigo. Nicki had liked the effect so much, she\u2019d asked Sienna to teach her. That had felt good\u2014being able to share such an innocent thing with a friend. It had made her feel young, not the old woman she\u2019d been since the day she first understood why Ming LeBon wanted her by his side, his own personal monster on a psychic leash.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she ordered the brown-eyed woman in the mirror. \u201cNot tonight. Be young and carefree tonight. Dance, drink, and laugh.\u201d With that, she slicked on poppy red lip color, grabbed a small purse, and stepped out.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus Christ, thank you God.\u201d</p><p>Startled by the masculine exclamation, she looked up to find herself facing Riordan, a novice soldier a year older than her. \u201cAre you coming out with us?\u201d she asked, closing her door.</p><p>\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t, I damn well would be now.\u201d He offered her his arm, bare below the short sleeves of a stone gray shirt that looked good on his muscular frame. \u201cPaint yourself to my side, Sin. Real close. I think I feel a chill coming on.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, she began to walk down the hall, her heels clicking on the floor. A few seconds later, she realized he was trailing behind her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the holdup?\u201d Glancing back, she caught him red-handed. \u201cAre you staring at my butt?\u201d</p><p>Riordan didn\u2019t bother to pretend innocence, his deep brown eyes full of wicked appreciation. \u201cHey, it\u2019s a nice butt. And those jeans, oh, mama.\u201d</p><p>It was exactly the confidence boost she needed. If Hawke refused to acknowledge the pulse of attraction between them\u2014though she\u2019d waited years to grow old enough for him, years where she\u2019d blocked her ears to the gossip about who he was with and when\u2014then she wasn\u2019t going to take it lying down. \u201cPick your tongue up off the floor, and let\u2019s go. Evie, Tai, and Cadence are probably already in the garage.\u201d</p><p>She was proven right. But they weren\u2019t the only ones. Maria was there, too, along with her boyfriend, Lake.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d the other woman said, a tentative smile on her face. \u201cI wanted to say sorry. It sucks that you got a worse punishment than me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sienna shrugged. \u201cMy own fault.\u201d It would be the last time she let her near-painful response to Hawke get in the way of how she lived her life. \u201cNo hard feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we just . . .\u201d Maria angled her head.</p><p>Nodding, Sienna stepped a little distance away from the others so she and Maria could talk in private. \u201cI understand,\u201d she said once they were out of hearing range. \u201cWe fought because your wolf wanted to establish dominance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, that didn\u2019t go so great.\u201d A self-deprecating grin. \u201cBut what I said about you being cold-blooded\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d On edge and angry with herself for being unable to forget Hawke, she\u2019d been feeling raw, vulnerable, had struck out at Maria\u2019s jibe without stopping to consider the fact that the very state of her emotions made the accusation patently untrue.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Maria put a hand on her arm. \u201cIt\u2019s not fine and we both know it\u2019s not true. I was talking any bullshit I could to goad you into a fight. My only excuse is that wolves my age tend to be dickheads.\u201d</p><p>Sienna\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cDifficult since you don\u2019t possess that particular body part, either on your head or elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>Maria snorted. \u201cI dunno\u2014I did a pretty good job of acting it.\u201d Tucking her hands into the back pockets of her jeans, she rocked back on her heels. \u201cI was meant to be your partner and I fucked with you.\u201d No smile now, dark eyes solemn. \u201cIt\u2019ll never happen again. I want you to know I\u2019d have you at my back anytime.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSame,\u201d Sienna said without hesitation. In the PsyNet, she\u2019d have looked for the betrayal hidden behind the contrition, but she\u2019d been in SnowDancer long enough to see Maria\u2019s words for what they were\u2014a declaration of both loyalty and friendship. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t all you, you know. I was looking for a fight.\u201d Maria had just provided a handy excuse.</p><p>\u201cYou sure have a mean kick,\u201d the other soldier said as they headed back.</p><p>\u201cJudd makes me train with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether to be jealous or offer commiseration.\u201d</p><p>They were both laughing when they reached the rest of the group.</p><p>\u201cNow that that\u2019s sorted\u201d\u2014Evie wrapped her arms around their waists, her personality evident in the radiance of her smile\u2014\u201care we ready to dance?\u201d</p> <p>Not only was Sienna ready to dance, but if a man made a move on her tonight . . . well, she might just let him. She was through with waiting.</p><p>ALONE in the apartment but for the sleeping children, Walker found himself looking at the sat phone he\u2019d recently been issued courtesy of his position as \u201cHead Wrangler\u201d for the ten-to-thirteen-year-olds.</p><p>The phone came preloaded with contact information for the other senior members of SnowDancer. Flicking through the directory, he stopped at Lara\u2019s name. The healer would be a good sounding board when it came to his concerns about Sienna\u2019s emotional state\u2014Lara was one of the most sensitive people in the pack.</p><p>His thumb hesitated over the Call button, the sensual echo of that kiss the night of the party causing every one of his muscles to go taut in a waiting kind of expectation. Unlike the changelings, he wasn\u2019t a man driven by the desire to touch, but Lara made him react in unexpected and uncomfortable ways. He wasn\u2019t used to having his body respond in such an undisciplined manner, but more, he wasn\u2019t used to having the reins slip from his grasp when it came to his mental reaction.</p><p>So many weeks later and he could still feel the softness of her skin beneath his fingertips, the warm seduction of her body under his palm, the sweetness of her lips parting as they met his own. She was small but curvy in a way that had made him want to stroke his hands over her at his leisure, to explore the intriguing shadows and arcs of her body. He\u2019d kept his hands from roaming that night . . . but not his mind.</p><p>He glanced at the phone again.</p><p>If he called her, she would come. He hadn\u2019t been an Arrow like Judd, but he\u2019d had his own reasons for learning to read people\u2014he knew that in spite of the fact that their friendship appeared irreparably damaged, Lara had the softest of hearts. The second he mentioned his concern about Sienna, he\u2019d have her immediate attention. And the instant she was in his quarters . . . images of kiss-wet lips, of a warm feminine form under his hands.</p><p>His body grew hard.</p> <p>It was an unwelcome reminder of how she impacted him, how she skewed the rules on which he\u2019d rebuilt his life. He took his finger off the Call button . . . and got up. There was a chance he could catch her at the infirmary.</p><p>BY midnight, fighting the constant compulsion to track down Sienna had gnawed Hawke\u2019s temper to a fine edge. It wasn\u2019t the best of times for him to receive a call from the manager of Wild, the changeling-owned bar and dance club that sat in a small but popular nightlife area just beyond the edge of den territory.</p><p>\u201cHawke, I need you to come pick up your pups.\u201d</p><p>Hawke rubbed his forehead. The only time Jos\u00e9 ever called him was when things had progressed to breaking point. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo bill for damages,\u201d Jos\u00e9 said to his surprise. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t get here soon, you\u2019ll probably be bailing a few of them out of jail.\u201d The deer changeling\u2014a dominant bull who could bash heads with the best of them, for all that he was non-predatory\u2014hung up.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Already dressed in jeans and a T-shirt since he\u2019d been wide awake, he pulled on well-worn work boots, then buzzed Riley.</p><p>His lieutenant was not impressed. \u201cDo you know what time it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. How many of them went down to Wild tonight?\u201d Riley would know. Riley knew everything.</p><p>\u201cSeven, but Ebony and Amos were in San Francisco for a security run\u201d\u2014a small pause\u2014\u201cand the system\u2019s not showing them logging back into the den, so they probably took a detour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need a second driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStay snuggled up to Mercy,\u201d Hawke said, already halfway to the garage. \u201cI\u2019ll get one of the night-shift people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on them.\u201d</p><p>Hawke paused. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in a mean mood, Hawke. Don\u2019t take it out on them.\u201d</p><p>Growling, Hawke snapped the phone shut. He was alpha for a reason\u2014and part of it was that he knew how to handle his people. Of course, Riley was also his most senior lieutenant for a reason. \u201cShit.\u201d Jogging the rest of the way to the garage, he volunteered Elias as the second driver. \u201cWere they driving when they went down?\u201d</p><p>Elias checked the computronic log. \u201cYep. Two vehicles. GPS says they\u2019re both parked a five-minute walk from the club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019ll drive one down\u2014you can bring up the second. One of the soldiers on city security tomorrow can swing by and pick up the other.\u201d</p><p>The drive took more than an hour, and Hawke hoped like hell the young group hadn\u2019t gotten into worse trouble in the meantime. Since Jos\u00e9\u2019s radar was finely tuned, chances were good he\u2019d alerted Hawke in plenty of time.</p><p>Parking the vehicle a block away, he and Elias made it to Wild around one thirty in the morning. The bouncer, one of Jos\u00e9\u2019s big, strapping cousins, raised his hand in a wave when he saw them. \u201cThat pretty little one with the cherry-tinted hair\u201d\u2014he whistled\u2014\u201cwhere you been hiding her?\u201d</p><p>Hawke went motionless.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>\u201cWHAT\u2019S THE TROUBLE?\u201d he asked, the wolf in his voice.</p><p>The other male avoided his eyes, as if aware Hawke was too much on edge to accept even the slightest challenge. \u201cGo in and see.\u201d</p><p>Entering the bar, he stayed to the shadows as he took in the lay of the land. The place was full of humans and changelings\u2014leopard, wolf, deer, swan, even a Rat. Their scents were clear threads to him, even entangled as they were in the confined space. Most of the non-predatories stuck together, while the predatories did the same. But wolf and leopard were mingling. Plenty.</p><p>Ebony was currently happily pasted up against a cat, while Riordan was all but devouring a leopard girl with his eyes as the two of them stood talking a small distance from the dance floor. Evie\u2014oh, dear God, but Indigo was going to blow a gasket\u2014was dressed in a tiny strapless dress made from some sparkly fabric that only just covered everything that should be covered. She was also giggling and drunk, a frothy pink cocktail in hand. Tai sat holding her against his chest, looking sober. Maybe there was hope for them yet.</p><p>Maria, Cadie, and the rest were out front, cheering.</p><p>At Sienna.</p><p>Who was dancing on the bar.</p><p>In fuck-you boots and a shirt that barely contained her breasts.</p><p>Eyes going wolf, Hawke began to stride through the crowd. A few aggressive young males turned to give him a talking-to . . . and froze, their gazes jerking away when they met the dominance in his own. Even the humans understood, going pale as they moved out of his path as fast as possible.</p><p>He realized part of the reason for Jos\u00e9\u2019s call when he saw the human men lined up along the bar, all of them with a look in their eye that said they\u2019d spill blood to possess the woman who danced with such wild, sensual grace. The SnowDancer males would, of course, have defended her with fists and claws the instant anyone tried to touch her.</p><p>And Jos\u00e9\u2019s bar would\u2019ve been trashed in minutes.</p><p>Then there were the leopard and wolf males giving each other dirty looks as interpack flirting took place. Riordan was being watched by at least three cats with violence on their minds, while Lake and Amos were currently glaring with intent at Ebony\u2019s dance partner.</p><p>The entire thing had the makings of a clusterfuck.</p><p>Shoving away the humans at the bar with rough hands, he reached out and gripped one leather-covered ankle.</p><p>Sienna stopped moving.</p><p>\u201cDown,\u201d he growled, meeting brown eyes so much less extraordinary than the truth of her cardinal gaze. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Music still pumped but the bar had gone silent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Sienna didn\u2019t immediately obey, and that just infuriated the wolf. \u201cLast warning, baby.\u201d</p><p>Holding his gaze, Sienna said, \u201cI\u2019m not breaking any of the Pack rules.\u201d</p><p>Every single person in the bar sucked in a breath.</p> <p>Hawke didn\u2019t pay them any attention. He\u2019d had enough. A single, precisely timed tug and he tilted her off balance. As she fell, he caught her, throwing her over his shoulder. \u201cOut!\u201d he ordered the other wolves as he left.</p><p>Sienna, having apparently recovered from the loss of breath caused by his sudden move, began to wiggle and twist. \u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>He tapped her behind, a short, sharp shock that had her freezing. \u201cDon\u2019t make me any more pissed than I am right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBully.\u201d It was muttered under her breath, but he heard it. \u201cYou\u2019ve got no right to punish me. None.\u201d</p><p>He tightened his hold on her as they hit the cold night air. \u201cYou want to talk punishment, fine. What the fuck did you think you were doing on that bar? Were you trying to cause a riot?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was having fun.\u201d Heaving breaths. \u201cPut me down. I can\u2019t breathe with your shoulder in my stomach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough.\u201d He didn\u2019t take his hands off her until he dumped her in the front passenger seat of the vehicle he\u2019d driven down. \u201cIn,\u201d he ordered her friends, all of whom had obeyed his order to leave.</p><p>Tai raised his hand, one arm around a suddenly sober-appearing Evie\u2019s waist as he tucked her into the heat of his body. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a single drink. I can drive the other truck.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s nose told him the young soldier was telling the truth. \u201cFine.\u201d He looked over the others. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky Jos\u00e9 called me before a punch was thrown.\u201d</p><p>Guilt on several male faces, while the women frowned. The men knew damn well what had been building in that bar.</p><p>\u201cNext time I get a call like this, I\u2019m instituting a curfew. Understood?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>As everyone dispersed, splitting themselves between Elias\u2019s truck and the one Tai was going to be driving, Hawke realized he was about to spend over an hour alone in a confined space with a female he\u2019d made every effort to avoid ever since she hit eighteen. A female who was almost spilling out of her shirt, allowing him glimpses of red satin against creamy gold skin.</p><p>Great, just fucking great.</p><p>SIENNA glared out the window as her friends scattered. \u201cTraitor,\u201d she mouthed to Evie when the other woman glanced back.</p><p>Evie winked at her. \u201cGive him hell . . . baby,\u201d Evie mouthed back.</p><p>Sienna\u2019s cheeks flamed as she remembered Hawke using the endearment in that taut, angry tone, which had raised every hair on her body. It probably meant nothing, except that he saw her as exactly that. A child. It didn\u2019t matter what she did, how mature she acted, he only seemed to pay attention to her at her worst moments.</p><p>Like tonight.</p><p>No, she thought, furious with him\u2014and with herself for continuing to let him affect her this way, that hadn\u2019t been a bad moment. She\u2019d been having fun. Enjoying herself as she had every right to do. He was probably fuming because he\u2019d been pulled out of Rosalie\u2019s bed. Her nails dug into her palms. If she\u2019d had claws, they\u2019d have been out right then, slicing savagely though the seats.</p> <p>\u201cNot a word,\u201d he snapped as he got into the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cDid you know what you were doing up on that bar?\u201d Not giving her a chance to answer, he continued, \u201cMost of those men were ready to grab you and strip you naked right there.\u201d</p><p>Her simmering temper ignited. \u201cI know how to defend myself, thanks to Indigo. And dancing wasn\u2019t a crime last time I checked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said, not a damn word.\u201d His hands tightened on the steering wheel as he drove them out of the popular nightlife area.</p><p>She snorted, too mad to be thinking about the sanity of challenging a predatory changeling male in the grip of pure raging fury. \u201cHow about instead of orders, Mr. Alpha Wolf, you actually stop hiding and talk to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push me, little girl.\u201d Quiet, quiet words.</p><p>The tone made every muscle in her body go tense, but she\u2019d been trained by a cold-blooded Councilor. Fear was something with which she had intimate familiarity\u2014and it wasn\u2019t hot, not like the emotion that burned through her veins at this moment. \u201cYou think I should just keep doing as I\u2019m told?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs that what gets you off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne,\u201d he said with such calm, she knew she was in the vehicle with a predator barely on the leash. \u201cI\u2019ll give you one free pass because you\u2019re drunk\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have a single alcoholic beverage.\u201d Alcohol had unpredictable effects on Psy abilities, and she couldn\u2019t afford to lose even an ounce of mental control. \u201cI\u2019m angry at you because you get to win all the arguments by using your alpha status to shut me down.\u201d</p><p>A dangerous pause. So dangerous that Sienna snapped her mouth closed, swallowing the words that wanted to escape.</p><p>Until he brought the truck to a halt deep in an unfamiliar part of den territory. The night was pitch-black, starless, and moonless, the trees murky shadows that seemed to form an impenetrable wall around them. \u201cWhy are we stopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to talk. We\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Her palms went damp at that smooth, silky tone.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m putting aside my \u2018alpha status.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Oh, he was furious.</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s see if you can win this argument.\u201d Turning in his seat, he leaned his arm along the back of hers. \u201cNow explain to me how you would\u2019ve stopped a massive fistfight in the bar tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not on me,\u201d she said, trying to breathe past the sheer power of him. \u201cThe women were an excuse\u2014the males were itching to go at each other since the minute we walked in. They\u2019re always playing dominance games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew that, and still you amped up the sexual energy in the room?\u201d</p><p>The truck was suddenly too small, too confined, Hawke\u2019s hotly masculine scent seeping into her very pores, touching parts of her no man had ever stroked. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A sudden crash of anger. \u201cI\u2019m not accountable for everyone! Maybe I wanted to have fun for a change. Maybe I wanted to not be in control for a few short minutes! Maybe I just wanted to dance.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s lashes came down. When they lifted back up, his gaze was night-glow, a brilliant ice blue shot with light. She sucked in a breath, realizing she was talking to the wolf now.</p><p>\u201cYou want to dance?\u201d Husky words that stroked along her skin like the softest fur.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen we dance.\u201d Reaching out, he switched on the vehicle\u2019s sound system and input a selection before stepping out.</p><p>Her door opened as a slow, smoky ballad began to play. \u201cCome.\u201d An invitation\u2014but mostly a demand.</p><p>\u201cMy shoes,\u201d she blurted out, anger buried under a wave of nervous anticipation.</p><p>\u201cThe ground\u2019s dry. They won\u2019t sink in.\u201d</p><p>Not sure this wasn\u2019t all a dream, she placed her hand in his and, fighting the wild rush of sensation engendered by his touch and his scent, allowed him to tug her around to the front of the vehicle. Breaking the hold, he put his hands on her hips and pulled her forward, his breath a heated caress across her cheek as he bent to speak against her ear. \u201cArms around my neck.\u201d</p><p>The command released her voice. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t being alpha here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Oh.</p><p>As she raised her arms, she realized her boots gave her enough height to cup his nape with one hand, while she placed the other on the muscled warmth of his shoulder. When he shifted position so that his jaw rubbed against her temple, her heart began to thud fast as a jackhammer.</p><p>This close, he was all hot, hard heat. Pure muscle and strength . . . and temptation. Always, he\u2019d been her temptation. He was the reason her Silence had shattered into innumerable shards the instant she\u2019d walked into SnowDancer territory. She should\u2019ve kept her distance, but she couldn\u2019t. Just once\u2014just for a little while\u2014she wanted him to be hers.</p><p>Teeth nipped at her ear.</p><p>She jumped.</p><p>\u201cPay attention.\u201d A rumbling growl.</p><p>Her nipples tightened to stiff points she hoped he couldn\u2019t feel. It was beyond tempting to spread the hand on his nape upward, into the thick, silver-gold silk of his hair, but she didn\u2019t dare break the moment. He had such beautiful hair, the same color as his pelt in wolf form. That told her more about how close his wolf was to the surface than anything else.</p><p>\u201cSienna.\u201d A deep murmur against her skin, his lips brushing her temple. \u201cThis can\u2019t be. You know that.\u201d</p><p>Her blood was thunder in her ears, her skin stretching taut over a body hypersensitized by a raw, near-painful craving. \u201cIs it because I\u2019m Psy?\u201d she forced herself to ask. Hawke hated the Psy\u2014that much she knew, though she didn\u2019t know the reason behind the depth of his animosity. The fact that he\u2019d accepted the Lauren family as deeply into the pack as he had was nothing short of miraculous.</p><p>A low growl that had her going motionless. \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re barely grown.\u201d He stroked his hand down her back, as if in reassurance.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t ready to be soothed. \u201cI haven\u2019t been a child since the day they came for me when I was five.\u201d A cardinal X could not be allowed to live outside of Council control. \u201cMing LeBon sure didn\u2019t sing me any lullabies.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s hand pressed against her lower back, big and warm and shockingly intimate through the thin fabric of her shirt. \u201cFive?\u201d The wolf was so apparent in his voice, she had to focus to understand him. \u201cYou were a baby.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and knew it held no humor. \u201cCardinals are trained from before we gain the ability to speak.\u201d The years she\u2019d spent with her mother, the commands had been gentle, given by a woman who had wanted her child to learn to protect herself on the psychic plane. Aware she\u2019d have drowned under the deluge of voices otherwise, Sienna had never resented the instruction; she missed her mother\u2019s touch to this day. \u201cThe first conscious thought I remember having was about the need to shield.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But when they\u2019d discovered she was an X, the shields they\u2019d put around her had been brutal prison walls, unlike anything she\u2019d known. She\u2019d been so small, so scared. Even her brave, strong mother, with her gentle telepathic touch, was gone, unable to reach Sienna through the hard carapace of Ming\u2019s creation. It had probably been for the best\u2014Kristine had stood no chance against a daughter who\u2019d put her in intensive care with a simple childish display of temper.</p><p>\u201cDid you ever play?\u201d Hawke\u2019s voice so rough, his body so muscular and overwhelming.</p><p>She had never felt more feminine, never felt more like a sexual creature. \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>A pause. \u201cSienna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cNo more questions. Not tonight.\u201d She wanted to dance with him, be a woman in the arms of a man who made every part of her awaken in a hunger she\u2019d never expected to feel and who, for this magical moment, was hers.</p><p>His jaw, heavy with stubble, rubbed against her temple again as he shifted his hold to press her closer.

I did very much enjoy your paper in the Journal of Archaeology, and it has nothing to do with being your daughter\u2014I totally agree with you about your interpretation of the newly discovered glyphs. Cho is wrong. I know it and you know it.</p><p>Dad, I wanted to talk to you about something else, too, something that\u2019s troubling me. I now have four Xs enrolled in my study (Gradients 3 through to 4.2), and from everything the Psy academics tell me, it means I\u2019ve done astonishingly well. The designation is so rare that if there were ten living X-Psy at any given time, it would be considered a miracle.</p><p>That isn\u2019t what worries me. Of the four I\u2019ve located, none are over the age of sixteen. There was a fifth known X, one of the boys tells me, a girl he met on the PsyNet. I got the impression he had a crush on her. The heartbreaking thing is, she died just short of her nineteenth birthday when her power consumed her.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to see my Xs die.</p><p>Alice</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>HAWKE\u2019S WOLF WASN\u2019T riding him as hard as it had been doing for the past week when he drove down to DarkRiver territory the next morning\u2014to talk to Lucas about the weapons coming into the area, to see if DarkRiver had any news on possible Pure Psy operatives in the city. It didn\u2019t take much thought to figure out that the wildness in him had been temporarily sated by the contact he\u2019d allowed himself with Sienna.</p> <p>He\u2019d been so angry at her\u2014always pushing his buttons, that girl. But then he\u2019d taken her into his arms, and all that anger had blazed into a darker, hotly possessive need that had urged him to bend his head, bite down on the throbbing pulse in her neck, leave a mark.</p><p>God, that shirt. One tug and those snaps would\u2019ve come apart, revealing the gold-kissed cream of her skin. He\u2019d wanted to taste her, stroke her, pet her. Simply holding her, simply dancing with her, had driven his wolf half to madness . . . but he would have shredded anyone who\u2019d dared interrupt that slow dance stolen in the silken shadows of night.</p><p>\u201cYour pelt,\u201d a lazy voice drawled as he walked into the clearing around Lucas\u2019s home, \u201cwould make a nice coat for my mate.\u201d</p><p>Giving Vaughn a desultory finger where the amber-haired sentinel stood in the shade of a large juniper tree, its trunk a rich reddish brown, Hawke said, \u201cI can scent Luc\u2014he inside?\u201d He nodded at the cabin below another large tree, an unoccupied aerie perched in its branches.</p><p>\u201cYep. Don\u2019t even think about going in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I\u2019ve had a lobotomy?\u201d Lucas\u2019s mate, Sascha, was heavily pregnant. As a result, the leopard alpha\u2019s protective tendencies had moved into the lethal range. \u201cI\u2019ll wait here. He\u2019ll scent me soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Lucas exited the cabin on the heels of that statement. \u201cSascha\u2019s sleeping,\u201d he said, angling his head toward the forest. \u201cVaughn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t take my eye off the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Hawke asked as they stepped deeper into the dappled sunshine filtering through the canopy.</p><p>\u201cReady to give birth.\u201d A chuckle. \u201cUnfortunately, the baby is comfortable right where he or she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t know the gender?\u201d Hawke wouldn\u2019t have had the selfcontrol to hold out\u2014and yeah, it hurt like a bitch to know he\u2019d never have the chance to test that theory, but that didn\u2019t dim his joy for the leopard alpha. \u201cIf I ask Sascha, will she tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it.\u201d A feral grin that was all teeth. \u201cSo, fill me in on these weapons shipments your people have detected.\u201d</p><p>Hawke gave him a quick rundown. \u201cMy gut says the Scotts\u2014everything points to them\u2014are going to mount an assault this time. Full-out, open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot surprising, given that they and the others have tried covert ops a number of times and failed.\u201d Lucas halted on the moss-covered verge beside a small, clear stream. \u201cSascha spoke to her mother\u2014there\u2019s definite Pure Psy activity in the city, but they\u2019re being very careful. They\u2019re well aware that not only are they not welcome, but that the last operative ended up with his brains leaking out his ears after Nikita found him out.\u201d</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t like Nikita Duncan, but he could appreciate the woman\u2019s efficiency in taking care of a threat. \u201cThat\u2019ll make them harder to pinpoint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRats are spread out across the city. Smallest sign of a Pure Psy base and we\u2019ll know.\u201d The leopard alpha glanced at Hawke. \u201cAre you planning on moving your vulnerable out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at this stage.\u201d Hawke had already discussed it with his lieutenants. \u201cThere\u2019s no overt threat yet, and we\u2019re wolves, Luc.\u201d Evacuating their home on such flimsy grounds would demoralize any predatory changeling, dominant or not. \u201cIf and when there is a credible threat, that\u2019s when we\u2019ll evacuate the noncombatants.\u201d The escape plans had been drafted long ago, could be put into motion within an hour, and the entire den cleared of their vulnerable within four. It would take far longer than that for any invader to break through SnowDancer\u2019s first line of defense.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s eyes gleamed cat-green in the muted light of the forest. \u201cWe made the same decision. I want Mercy to liaise with Riley to coordinate our evacuation plans. Work for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it. I think we should give WindHaven a heads-up, too.\u201d The falcons could provide air support if necessary. \u201cI\u2019ll have Drew talk to them,\u201d he said when Luc nodded.</p><p>\u201cI hear your boy\u2019s been out to the Canyon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalcons love Drew\u2014I think he even had an indecent proposal or three.\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s head turned toward the cabin. \u201cIndigo know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want bloodshed.\u201d Hawke fell in step with the other alpha as he began to head back. \u201cSascha awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>A pang of envy uncurled in Hawke\u2019s gut. He wondered what it would be like to be connected to a person with such intimacy. Yes, he was alpha, linked to his lieutenants and, to a lesser extent, to the rest of his pack. But it wasn\u2019t the same. None of them were his.</p><p>A rush of memory, a sleek feminine body pressed against his own, the scent of wild spice in his every breath as the rapid tattoo of her pulse sang a sirensong to his dominant nature. The wolf whispered that she could be his, only his, until possessive hunger pulsed through him, turning his muscles rigid.</p><p>He parted with Lucas at the clearing, digging his claws into his palms to cut through the compulsion. The scent of blood licked into the air, and he let it overwhelm the burn of sexual need for the moment. It wouldn\u2019t last, he was fully aware of that. If he knew what was good for him, for his pack, he\u2019d finish what he\u2019d started a couple of days ago and take a lover. A lover who knew the score, who wouldn\u2019t look at him in the morning with eyes bruised with the knowledge that he\u2019d given her all he could.</p><p>There was nothing else left in him.</p><p>HAVING done a half-day shift on perimeter security, Sienna was home in plenty of time to work on an academic project and have dinner with Marlee and Toby. \u201cThey\u2019re both in bed,\u201d she told Walker when her uncle walked in the door after a later shift.</p><p>Walker shrugged off his jacket to reveal solid shoulders covered in a rough denim shirt. \u201cI\u2019ve got it now.\u201d</p><p>Instead of leaving, she heated up a meal, put it on the table. Walker, having ducked into his bedroom to kick off his shoes and wash up, came in as she was placing a glass of water beside his plate. Putting his hand on the back of her head, he leaned down to press his lips to her forehead, much as she\u2019d done with Toby and Marlee. \u201cYou\u2019re troubled.\u201d</p><p>It almost broke her, the tender way he held her. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d She couldn\u2019t bear to discuss last night with anyone, to share the painful magic of a dance, a touch that might never be repeated and yet that had branded her. She could still feel the rough kiss of Hawke\u2019s jaw against her temple, his hand so big and warm on her lower back, his chest a hard, muscled wall that flexed against her breasts.</p><p>Drawing back, Walker looked at her with pale green eyes that saw too much, but he didn\u2019t push. Relief a crashing wave inside of her, she said a quick good-bye and shrugged into her own jacket, deciding to go for a walk under the starlit sky. That same sky had been pure midnight when Hawke took her into his arms, as if the universe itself was conspiring to allow them to steal a single hidden moment.</p><p>\u201cSienna!\u201d</p><p>Startled, she turned to see Maria running her way. \u201cAre you off to do your shift?\u201d</p><p>A bounce of loose, silky curls as the other novice nodded. \u201cSo, you going to tell me what happened with you and Hawke last night?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing.\u201d Nothing but a slow, heartbreaking dance that had destroyed her illusions about her ability to get over a man who refused to even consider the idea that maybe, just maybe, there weren\u2019t as many years between them as he believed.</p><p>Thankfully, Maria took her words at face value. \u201cYou had the early shift, right? Must\u2019ve been hard getting up after staying up so late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fine.\u201d There had been no need to get up\u2014she hadn\u2019t slept since returning to the den. \u201cActually, do you mind if I run down with you? I\u2019m not tired enough to sleep yet.\u201d If she slept, she\u2019d dream, the scent of Hawke haunting her in the soft dark.</p> <p>\u201cCompany\u2019s always welcome.\u201d It was the answer of a wolf.</p><p>They ran down in companionable silence to the perimeter section where Maria was taking over from Lake. Breathing hard but not winded, Sienna gave the two of them privacy as they touched each other in that affectionate wolf way\u2014nose to nose, body to body, the kiss an extension of the full-body contact.</p><p>Sienna had done her own shift in a different area of den territory, so there were new things to explore here. But still she almost missed it: a pen, gleaming and dark. Guessing it had fallen out of a packmate\u2019s pocket, she picked it up\u2014the pack was scrupulous about ensuring no garbage littered their land. It wasn\u2019t until it was in her hand that she realized the sleek metallic cylinder wasn\u2019t a pen at all but a high-powered torch, an expensive item.</p><p>The SnowDancers had a small number of them. Used almost exclusively by non-changeling members of the pack\u2014the wolves\u2019 night vision was better than any illumination the torches could provide\u2014they were logged in and out with meticulous precision. Someone was probably in trouble for losing this. Sliding it into a pocket, she walked over to join Lake as he got ready to return to the den.</p><p>Body exhausted enough that there was a chance of a dreamless sleep, she parted with him at the entrance and went to log in the torch . . . to discover each and every one of the pack\u2019s set sitting in the box where they were stored. Hairs rising on the back of her neck, she made a call to Maria. \u201cCan you do me a favor?\u201d she asked when the other woman answered.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo about a hundred meters east of where Lake was standing when we arrived, tell me what you scent.\u201d</p><p>No sounds except for rustling as Maria jogged over. Then, \u201cPsy. I smell Psy.\u201d</p><p>HAWKE finished checking out the section where Sienna had found the torch. Like Maria, he immediately caught the harsh metallic scent exuded by some Psy\u2014as if they\u2019d gone so deep into Silence, they\u2019d lost their humanity. Nothing but the most brittle cold remained.</p><p>Sienna hadn\u2019t been cold.</p><p>Warm and curvy and muscled in a supple feminine way, she\u2019d surprised him with the softness of her. They\u2019d always been antagonists, always fought. To have her so sweet and lush against him had been a gift, walking away pure torture. His wolf didn\u2019t understand why he\u2019d done so\u2014to the animal, she smelled like a mature female. It didn\u2019t comprehend that she was a young girl barely become a woman.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t been a child since the day they came for me when I was five.</p><p>The memory incited a killing rage within him. He\u2019d always known she\u2019d been conditioned into Silence as a child, but until she\u2019d said that, he hadn\u2019t understood the painful depth of what her gift had demanded from her.</p><p>She\u2019d never played.</p><p>How was that possible? Play was as necessary for a wolf as breathing.</p><p>She played with us.</p><p>It was the wolf\u2019s voice. Scowling, he went to reject the assertion. Sienna had driven him crazy with her tricks since moving into the den. The party she\u2019d thrown to celebrate her eighteenth birthday had ended up with a lot of naked wolves freezing their asses off in the lake, their clothes scattered over so many acres, he didn\u2019t ever want to know that the hell they\u2019d been doing.</p><p>If her intent had been to drive him to the asylum\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou confirm it?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d scented Riley nearing, didn\u2019t startle. \u201cYeah. Definitely Psy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d A harsh exhalation. \u201cThey\u2019re really going to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny word from our sources?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas spoke to Nikita. She says tensions are increasing in the Council, and it\u2019s out in the open now. Henry and Shoshanna Scott are making it clear they think the two of them should lead. Anyone who argues differently is in their sights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need to be in the middle of a Psy war.\u201d His duty was to protect his people\u2014the Psy could destroy themselves for all he cared . . . as they\u2019d once almost destroyed SnowDancer.</p><p>Riley said, \u201cNo,\u201d but his tone brought up another question.</p><p>Hawke stared at the pine needle\u2013strewn land in front of him, the ground otherwise clear because of the heavy canopy. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking the same thing I am\u2014no way is this going to be contained to the Psy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Max pointed out,\u201d he said, naming Nikita\u2019s human security chief, \u201cthis region\u2019s already seen as interlinked. No matter what, they won\u2019t leave us be.\u201d A shrug. \u201cAnd fact is, we\u2019ve bitten back and bitten hard. I think at least part of the Council has decided we have too much power to be allowed to continue as we are.\u201d</p><p>Hawke knew that. He also understood that Nikita and Anthony were the lesser of two evils, but it still pissed him off that the pack had been forced to work with a couple of Councilors. \u201cLet\u2019s increase the security patrols around the boundary. Don\u2019t worry too much about the border with DarkRiver, but we need to let them know the Psy might be sniffing around even though it looks like they\u2019re focused on us.\u201d</p><p>Riley nodded, his gaze thoughtful. Hawke waited for the lieutenant to speak. Riley and Indigo were the solid foundation on which he stood\u2014Riley had been there since before Hawke became alpha at fifteen. At the time, Hawke had had the strength of the remaining lieutenants around him, but he\u2019d gone most often to the level-headed teenager who was his best friend. Indigo, a little younger, had entered the picture a few years later but had become Hawke\u2019s left arm as Riley was his right. They\u2019d pulled Hawke back from the edge more than once, pushed him when necessary, and offered support without question. It was a gift, one he never took for granted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to ask Kenji and Alexei to fine-tune our strategic plan,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThe fact it appears they\u2019re running physical reconnaissance in our territory argues for a rapid escalation. We need to be ready.\u201d</p><p>Hawke nodded. The two lieutenants had the best tactical minds in the pack. \u201cUse Drew as well. He might be able to pinpoint areas of vulnerability we might otherwise miss.\u201d The SnowDancer tracker wasn\u2019t only Hawke\u2019s eyes and ears among the most vulnerable in the pack; he\u2019d also become a clearinghouse for all kinds of information.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab him for the comm-conference with Kenji and Alexei tomorrow,\u201d Riley said, then glanced at Hawke. \u201cI hear you went dancing last night.\u201d</p><p>The words made every muscle in his body go tight, but he kept his tone even. \u201cI\u2019ve had a talk with the young males and so has Lucas. That kind of bullshit won\u2019t be tolerated.\u201d A little posturing between young dominants was expected and accepted. Hard physical violence? No.</p><p>\u201cAlliance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRock solid. This isn\u2019t about that\u2014it\u2019s because of you and Mercy.\u201d Everyone was still trying to work out the rules for the whole interpack dating thing, juveniles and older adults included. Add in testosterone and you got last night. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t appreciate you stealing us a leopard sentinel.\u201d</p><p>Riley didn\u2019t smile at the familiar joke, perceptive eyes trained on Hawke. \u201cWhy did Jos\u00e9 call you and not Lucas if both groups were making trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJos\u00e9 switches between us. Luc gets the next postmidnight call.\u201d</p><p>A silence filled only with the rustle of the trees as a stiff wind blew through the canopy.</p><p>\u201cYou need to talk about it?\u201d Riley asked after the forest had gone quiet again.</p><p>\u201cNothing to talk about.\u201d</p><p>Riley\u2019s nickname wasn\u2019t The Wall for nothing. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been one to ignore a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why does the gym log show you there half the night, every night?\u201d</p><p>Hawke growled low in his throat. \u201cKeeping tabs on me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job.\u201d Riley\u2019s temper remained even. \u201cI let you go lone wolf up in the mountains, but if you think I\u2019ll watch you self-destruct, you don\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf snarled, but he and Riley had too much history between them for him to shrug off the concern\u2014and what it meant. \u201cCan you cover for me tomorrow afternoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask.\u201d That the other man didn\u2019t question Hawke about what it was he was planning to do, told him exactly how well his lieutenant knew him.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>SASCHA RUBBED THE hard mound of her pregnant belly and stared at the jar of Moreno cherry jam. \u201cNo. Absolutely not,\u201d she said to the child in her womb.</p><p>The baby wiggled, its emotions sparking of hunger.</p><p>Groaning, she picked up the jar, unscrewed it, and spooned up the jam. It should\u2019ve tasted far too sweet, far too rich. Instead, it was ambrosia on her tongue. Unable to stifle a moan of greedy pleasure, she leaned against the counter in the staff kitchen at DarkRiver HQ and licked the spoon. It was tempting to eat a second spoonful, but in spite of the baby\u2019s ravenous urgings, she closed the lid and put the jam away. It\u2019s not good for you, she told her child. We already had chocolate-cherry ice cream.</p><p>\u201cYou missed a spot.\u201d Lucas crooked a finger from the doorway.</p><p>Leaving the spoon in the dishwasher, she walked over. \u201cDid I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He leaned over to lick up the jam with a quick, catlike flick of his tongue, his hand stroking with gentle possessiveness over her abdomen. \u201cMmm, cherries.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laughter in her mind, pure delight. Their baby knew its daddy.</p><p>\u201cYou look more beautiful every day,\u201d he murmured in her ear, his breath warm, his body so sensually familiar.</p><p>Sascha ran her hand up over his shoulder to close around his nape. \u201cCharm me some more.\u201d</p> <p>A chuckle, wicked words that made her toes curl. \u201cDorian\u2019s ready to drive you home,\u201d he finally said. \u201cBut maybe I should come instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never get any work done then.\u201d Unable to resist that look in his panther-green eyes, she pulled him forward to claim a single deep kiss. \u201cNow, behave.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, he put one hand on her lower back and walked her down to the elevator. \u201cI want to have a sentinel meeting tonight to discuss the security issues. You up for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll order the pizza.\u201d Nuzzling her face against his neck when he stopped to press the down arrow, she heard a couple of wolf whistles at her back.</p><p>Lucas grinned. \u201cHow\u2019s our little princess?\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019d asked her not to tell him the sex of their child, but he was convinced it was a girl. \u201cThe baby\u2014which may or may not be a girl,\u201d she teased, \u201cis quite active and interested in the world this morning.\u201d Their child had an inquisitive mind. \u201cHigh level of psychic activity.\u201d</p><p>Lucas waited until they were inside the elevator to say, \u201cAny idea what type?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrong telepathy,\u201d Sascha said, \u201cbut hard to know other than that. I\u2019ll have a chat with the Shine medic, see if he has any ideas about how best to measure the baby\u2019s psychic abilities.\u201d The Psy race, focused as it was on \u201cpurebred\u201d Psy, didn\u2019t have the protocols in place to deal with a child who would carry its father\u2019s wild changeling blood intermingled with Sascha\u2019s own.</p><p>Shine, on the other hand, was made up of the descendants of Psy who\u2019d defected from the Net at the inception of Silence and intermarried/mated with the human and changeling populations. \u201cI\u2019ll need to make certain I teach our child the correct shielding procedures.\u201d Her heart ached with a sudden, potent rush of emotion. She\u2019d never expected to be a mother, having decided long ago that she wouldn\u2019t sentence a child to the same half life she\u2019d lived in the Net. Then Lucas had appeared in her life. You are my heart.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t a telepath, but their mating bond had grown even deeper during the pregnancy, and she knew he heard her. Turning, he took her into his arms. The words he whispered were raw, rough, the love words of an alpha to his mate. Lucas could charm, but this was who he was at the core, and she adored him. \u201cCome home early tonight,\u201d she said against his mouth when they parted.</p><p>Kisses on her closed eyelids, her nose, the corners of her lips. \u201cAnything you want.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of hours later, her body and soul were still humming in bone-deep contentment when someone knocked on the cabin door. The sole reason Sascha didn\u2019t send out an immediate alert was that she recognized the mental signature of the man on the other side. Opening it, she smiled. \u201cWhy do you live to aggravate my security?\u201d</p><p>Judd Lauren glanced over his shoulder to where a scowling DarkRiver soldier had materialized out of the trees. \u201cIt\u2019s good to keep them on their toes. Can you talk?\u201d he asked after she waved the sentry away.</p><p>Knowing the reason for the unexpected visit, she nodded at the outdoor furniture situated neatly under the eaves of the cabin. \u201cLet\u2019s sit outside.\u201d Another man\u2019s scent inside the house would infuriate Lucas\u2019s panther right now. While Sascha had no problem confronting her mate when he got too overprotective, she also understood he was a predatory changeling male driven by the most primal instincts\u2014expecting him to act human would be to ask him to deny an integral part of himself. \u201cSo,\u201d she said after bringing out a pot of vanilla-scented tea and taking a seat, \u201cthe Eldridge book.\u201d</p><p>Expressionless brown eyes met her own, but Sascha had felt Judd Lauren\u2019s heart, knew the former Arrow had the capacity to feel, to love with violent intensity. \u201cAre you any closer to locating it?\u201d he asked now.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The second Eldridge manuscript, meant to be the result of a research project on X-Psy, was half myth, half legend. Both DarkRiver and SnowDancer were working every single Psy contact they had to discover the truth of it, because if it existed, it might contain clues that would help Sienna learn how to handle her abilities\u2014as Alice Eldridge\u2019s first book had done for Sascha.</p><p>But, Sascha thought, cupping her hands around the porcelain teacup, though she hadn\u2019t known it at the time, she\u2019d never been as alone as Sienna. Dormant they might be, but there were thousands of E-Psy in the Net. There were no other cardinal X-Psy. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>Judd took a sip of his tea, made a startlingly male face\u2014somehow, she didn\u2019t expect that kind of thing from a former assassin\u2014and put it right back down. \u201cShe\u2019s maintaining,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue right now isn\u2019t with her psychic control, it\u2019s with her emotional stability.\u201d</p><p>Sascha read between the lines. \u201cMaybe I should have a talk with her.\u201d Sienna had become very much a part of Sascha\u2019s family in the time she\u2019d spent in DarkRiver, and Sascha wanted to see for herself how the other cardinal was handling things with a man as dominant and as strong as Sascha\u2019s own mate. A man whose heart carried so many scars that Sascha would\u2019ve warned Sienna away . . . except that Sienna bore her own.</p> <p>Judd\u2019s fingers curled into a fist on the table, and for a moment, Sascha thought he might betray the emotions that had to be tearing at his heart, but all he said was, \u201cI\u2019ll bring her down tonight.\u201d</p><p>Reassured by the knowledge that he\u2019d confide in Brenna even if he spoke to no one else, she put down her own cup. \u201cI\u2019m hardly an invalid.\u201d He was as bad as a leopard. \u201cI\u2019ll drive up with Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t liable to permit you that far from the heart of DarkRiver territory. Give the man some peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudd! No wonder you fit in so well with the wolves.\u201d Laughing, she decided it might actually be better for Sienna to have a break from the den. \u201cFine, we\u2019ll do it your way.\u201d</p><p>As the former Arrow melted into the forest, on his way to see a small boy who\u2019d been born with the same gift that made Judd so lethal, Sascha poured another cup of tea and considered the mysterious Eldridge manuscript. She, Faith, and Ashaya had all exhausted their sources, to no avail. She\u2019d even chanced trusting the director of Shine with the question\u2014but Dev\u2019s people hadn\u2019t had an X in the original group of defectors and knew close to nothing about them.</p><p>As far as the mainstream world was concerned, there was no such thing as an X-Psy.</p><p>MID-AFTERNOON the day after Sienna had alerted them to the Psy incursion, Hawke crouched in a sun-drenched corner of a small clearing ringed by ancient sequoias with roots the thickness of a grown man\u2019s body and dotted with a myriad wild blooms adapted to the cold mountain climate. \u201cHey, Rissa.\u201d</p><p>The only reply was silence. But it was a peaceful silence. As this place was peaceful, a haven whenever he needed one. And today, he needed it desperately.</p><p>\u201cThey all think,\u201d he said, clearing away a few stray leaves to uncover a delicate patch of wildflowers the shade of the sky at noon, \u201cthat I\u2019m being stubborn without reason. They don\u2019t understand I\u2019m protecting her.\u201d He was brutally attracted to Sienna. That much, he\u2019d admitted to himself if no one else. But the cruel fact was, he could give her little beyond a physical relationship. \u201cI gave my heart to you a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>Theresa had been five years old when she died in an avalanche. He\u2019d been ten. Too young to love her the way a man loves a woman, or even the way a boy loves a girl. But the wolf had understood from the moment they met who she was to him, who she would become\u2014his mate.</p><p>They\u2019d been best friends since that instant, the connection between them a bright, shining thread, their relationship full of laughter and a delight that was beyond innocent. It had been nothing like the tumultuous nature of the craving that raked him with blade-sharp claws anytime he was in Sienna\u2019s vicinity. The scent of her alone could send his wolf insane, the taste of her a lingering, maddening spice on his tongue.</p><p>\u201cWolves only mate once, Rissa,\u201d he said, using the old childhood pet name he\u2019d been responsible for coining. \u201cEveryone knows that.\u201d</p><p>But we never mated.</p><p>The voice he heard in his mind when he thought of Theresa was never that of the child she\u2019d been, but of the woman she would\u2019ve become. A woman full of warmth and gentleness, a woman who wouldn\u2019t have been a soldier but a maternal female, part of the beating heart of the pack.</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he murmured, refusing to give up a truth that had shaped so much of his life. \u201cYou were my mate. We would\u2019ve mated when we grew old enough.\u201d</p><p>The wind whispered through the trees, through his hair. It was a touch he\u2019d felt a thousand times over the years, and always, it had left him centered and calm. Today, however, as he rose to his feet and walked away from the final resting place of the girl who would\u2019ve owned his heart as a woman, he felt strangely dissatisfied, off-kilter.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a sensation either man or wolf enjoyed.</p><p>SIENNA was ready to head down to DarkRiver territory with Judd around eight that evening. Seeing Riordan as she left her quarters, she lifted a hand. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He stopped a few feet away, shifting from foot to foot and avoiding her gaze. \u201cYou okay? Hawke was pretty pissed when he came down to Wild the other night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know he wouldn\u2019t hurt any of us.\u201d She made no attempt to hide her shock that he\u2019d even asked the question, it was so incomprehensible.</p><p>Riordan colored, looked up. \u201cUh, yeah. That\u2019s not what I was talking about.\u201d</p><p>Sienna stared.</p><p>\u201cJeez, Sin he made it clear you were his.\u201d</p><p>A punch of memory\u2014a hard male body holding her close enough to kiss, his voice an intimate roughness against her senses, his hands so big and hot on her skin. \u201cNo,\u201d she forced out, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing there.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t permit there to be. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d Riordan\u2019s eyes crinkled at the corners. \u201cThing is, no one else is going to come near you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>A shrug, a hand thrust through chocolate-dark curls. \u201cHe\u2019s the alpha, babe. Only an idiot would try to poach on his territory.\u201d</p> <p>She gritted her teeth. \u201cI. Am. Not. His. Territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, look, isn\u2019t that Marlee?\u201d</p><p>Sienna turned automatically. Riordan was nowhere to be seen when she realized she\u2019d been had and swiveled back to face him. \u201cChicken!\u201d she called out before continuing on her way.</p><p>She ran into Evie not far from the exit, flat out asked her if the other novice had been spouting bullshit.</p><p>Her friend winced. \u201cUm, no. Hawke definitely had the alpha-possessive vibe going on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want me.\u201d Not enough to see past his preconceptions. Her jaw tightened, her muscles tensing as if in readiness for a fight. Stubborn, arrogant, infuriating man!</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Evie put her hand on Sienna\u2019s arm. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s good news\u2014seriously, any woman who takes him on is going to need brass balls. Big ones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying mine are too small?\u201d It was easier to be flip, to stoke the heat of her frustrated anger than to acknowledge the hurt inside of her, the bruise that kept growing ever bigger in spite of all her vows to not allow this pull toward Hawke to savage her.</p><p>\u201cSmartass.\u201d Laughing, Evie shook her head. \u201cLook, if there really is nothing going on, he has to make sure the Pack males know that. Otherwise, not only will your dating life go into a death spiral inside the pack, the boys will scare off any other male, changeling or human, who dares look in your direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Sienna had no interest in dating anyone else, but she would not be humiliated by being claimed by Hawke and then left unwanted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been around the XY component of SnowDancer for several years.\u201d Evie raised her eyebrows. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPack males stick together.\u201d</p><p>With that thought circling in her mind, she wasn\u2019t in any mood to see Hawke walking out of the trees near the White Zone, where she\u2019d gone to wait for Judd. His wolf-pale eyes spotted her at once, and he changed direction to block out the night in front of her. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked, as if he had every right to know.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d A dangerous silence greeted her words . . . and she couldn\u2019t help herself. \u201cUnless you\u2019re pulling rank?\u201d</p><p>A silence that had her skin stretching tight over her bones, her heartbeat hammering in her ears.</p><p>\u201cHad to push, didn\u2019t you, Sienna?\u201d Stepping close, close enough that she had to tip her head back to meet his gaze, he took a long, deep breath. \u201cYou changed your shampoo.\u201d</p><p>A sudden, melting warmth invaded her body at the sound of his voice\u2014as if he was savoring the scent. \u201cLara had some samples she gave out to the women in the break room this morning.\u201d The SnowDancer healer had been in an edgy kind of mood, so Sienna had kept her mouth shut and taken the sample when it was shoved into her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s wild apples.\u201d She had no idea why she\u2019d said that, why she continued to speak to him.</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d He lifted his hand to run a strand of her hair through his fingers.</p><p>Fighting every cell in her body, she stepped back. \u201cStop it. No touching. No acting possessive.\u201d</p> <p>Hawke\u2019s wolf prowled to the surface, a primal presence behind the human skin. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll or nothing.\u201d She held her ground though she was shaking inside, her blood going alternately hot and cold. \u201cIf you want me, take me. Or let me go.\u201d</p><p>A slow blink, the force of his personality a pulse against her skin, a near physical push. If she\u2019d been smart, she would\u2019ve backed down, but this was her emotional life on the line, and she\u2019d fought too hard to surrender it to anyone. Even an alpha wolf used to dominance. \u201cI just found out,\u201d she said through a throat that was suddenly bone dry, \u201cthat none of the boys are going to ask me out after the scene you pulled at Wild.</p><p>\u201cTake out an ad if you need to,\u201d she continued when the wolf just watched her without blinking, \u201cbut make sure they know I\u2019m not yours.\u201d Her need for him was a claw ripping at her insides. When he finally slept with Rosalie or another packmate, it would savage her\u2014she couldn\u2019t control that, but she damn well could ensure she didn\u2019t have to suffer the humiliation of being publicly discarded.</p><p>A low growl that made the hairs on the back of her neck rise. Staying in place was hard, so hard, when all she wanted to do was back down and crawl all over him. No. No more. He plans to take a lover. The mental reminder of what he intended to do to sate his wolf\u2019s touch-hunger was the last straw. \u201cI mean it, Hawke.\u201d She was done with throwing herself at a man who didn\u2019t want her.</p><p>\u201cSo decisive,\u201d he murmured in that calm tone that had adrenaline flooding her body, the primitive part of her brain conscious she was in the presence of a predator. \u201cGot your eye on someone?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what made her say it. \u201cNo. But I have no plans to die a virgin.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>HAWKE WENT PREDATOR-STILL. \u201cKit\u2019s been a good boy, has he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, none of your business.\u201d Refusing to be intimidated, she glanced over his shoulder. \u201cExcuse me, my ride\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>Hawke stepped sideways to block her. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her body threatened to lock her into place, so strong was the impact of him. Only her fury kept her going. \u201cMove.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring her command, he continued to hold her gaze with that wild wolf one even as he directed his next words to Judd, who\u2019d just hopped out of the SUV. \u201cWhere are you taking her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were heading down to see Sascha, but I\u2019ve just had a contact I need to chase up fast.\u201d Judd looked at Sienna. \u201cOkay if we delay this till tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need.\u201d Hawke smiled and held his hand back for the keys. \u201cI can drive her to the cats.\u201d</p><p>Sienna stared at Judd, sending him telepathic messages that seemed to go unheard. \u201cNo, that\u2019s fine,\u201d she said out loud. \u201cI can wai\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Judd was already handing Hawke the keys. \u201cBetter you go down tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cSince the visit\u2019s been cleared with Sascha\u2019s security.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can drive,\u201d she pointed out through gritted teeth to the wolf blocking her way. \u201cJudd was only coming with me because he wanted to take part in the discussion.\u201d She held out a hand. \u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter.\u201d</p><p>To her shock, it was Judd who stopped her escape attempt. \u201cIt\u2019s late. You\u2019ve never driven this route in the dark\u2014and it\u2019ll be darker still by the time you head back.\u201d</p><p>What is wrong with you?! she telepathed. I cannot be in a car alone with him. Especially when those ice blue eyes had gone slightly aglow.</p><p>Deal with it. It was a pitiless response. If you need that to be an order from a lieutenant, then consider it done.</p><p>She clenched her jaw, but no way in hell was she about to disobey an order and bring her maturity into question yet again. So either she allowed Hawke to drive, or she stayed put. It was tempting to seize the latter option, but not only did she want to see Sascha, she would not give Hawke the satisfaction of knowing he\u2019d derailed her plans. \u201cI\u2019ll wait in the car.\u201d</p><p>She was ensconced in the passenger seat, her wireless speaker buds in her ears, by the time Hawke finished talking with Judd and got into the driver\u2019s seat. He didn\u2019t say anything until he\u2019d turned the SUV around and they were on their way. Then he leaned over and pulled out the bud on his side.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>But he\u2019d managed to grab the tiny music player from her lap, too, throwing it over his shoulder into the backseat. \u201cI don\u2019t like being ignored.\u201d</p><p>She set her jaw and twisted in her seat, reaching for the player. He let her find it . . . to take it off her an instant later with changeling speed. It landed on the backseat again, along with the bud still in his hand. \u201cNext time, I throw it out the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could\u2014\u201d She let out an aggravated breath and removed the remaining bud, placing it on a tray on the dash. \u201cNow who\u2019s being childish?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, relaxing into the seat when she made no further effort to retrieve the music player. \u201cCountry and western?\u201d he said as he navigated the forest track SnowDancer kept deliberately crude, with plenty of lowhanging foliage to deter the use of hover facilities\u2014to make sure no one could sneak up on the den by ground vehicle. \u201cI would\u2019ve picked you as a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>She ignored him in favor of staring out the window.</p><p>Except it was hard to ignore over two-hundred pounds of muscled male wolf when he didn\u2019t want to be ignored. Reaching out, he tugged on a strand of her hair. \u201cTell me about Kit.\u201d</p><p>She pushed away his hand, well aware she succeeded only because he let her. \u201cKit is smart, sexy, and gorgeous. A total package.\u201d He was also wickedly funny and could be charming in a way only a feline could be. Too bad she had the terrible taste to hunger for a wolf instead.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s hands tightened on the manual steering wheel. \u201cA real prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could learn something from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful.\u201d A quiet warning. \u201cYou only get to push so far.\u201d</p><p>She was too mad and sad and hurting to care. \u201cWow,\u201d she said with a wide-eyed look of mock amazement, \u201cyou lasted an entire two minutes before pulling rank.\u201d</p><p>To her shock, he laughed. It was an open, uninhibited sound, and it held her absolute and utter attention. Hawke rarely laughed like that, and never with her. With such open joy, his wolf in his voice, in his face. \u201cYou can be a real brat.\u201d</p><p>It was difficult to maintain a tough front when his laugh had wrapped around her like a rough caress, eroding her defenses to nothing, but she couldn\u2019t let him see that, see how very vulnerable she was when it came to him. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make me wrong.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s just us, there\u2019s no rank, no alpha, no soldier. Only Hawke and Sienna.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d never, in a million years, expected to succeed in getting him to put aside the hierarchy. Her breath stuck in her throat, her palms suddenly damp.</p><p>\u201cLost for words?\u201d A glance of ice blue before he returned his attention to the forest track.</p> <p>Since Hawke\u2019s eyes never changed color, no matter his form, most people found it impossible to tell whether they were talking to the man or the wolf. Sienna always knew. Always. The power inside of her recognized the same wild energy in the wolf who was Hawke\u2019s other half. \u201cNo,\u201d she said at last, \u201cjust wondering how long you\u2019ll be able to hack it before you fall back on those rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep pushing, baby,\u201d he murmured in that low, deep voice that touched places in her body it had no business touching. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what it gets you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrustration!\u201d she said, throwing caution to the winds on an adrenalinefueled rush of courage. \u201cThat\u2019s all it\u2019s ever gotten me. If sexual attraction followed any kind of a logical rule, I\u2019d be in bed with Kit right now instead of sitting next to a man too scared to take a chance.\u201d</p><p>A charged silence.</p><p>Sienna couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d said that. It was going too far, even for her. Hawke was alpha\u2014whether or not the rules were currently in operation between them\u2014which meant he was dominant beyond any Psy or human man, and most changeling males, too. Men like that did not like having their strength questioned on any level.</p> <p>\u201cAfter your meeting with Sascha,\u201d he said, his tone silky with menace, \u201cthat\u2019s when we\u2019ll talk about fear.\u201d</p><p>Sienna leaned back in her seat, trying to control her racing heartbeat. He could hear it, of that she had no doubt. But she was Psy, had been Ming LeBon\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. She wasn\u2019t about to let anyone scare her off\u2014not even a predatory changeling wolf so lethal, the feral wolves treated him as their leader.</p><p>Brass balls. Big ones.</p><p>The memory of Evie\u2019s words gave her a slightly hysterical confidence, but it was confidence nonetheless. Using every ounce of the will that had allowed her to retain a personality even in Ming\u2019s tender care, she wrenched her heartbeat and breathing under control. It had nothing to do with what she felt and everything to do with playing a very dangerous game with a predator who had much bigger teeth.</p><p>A growl filled the vehicle, filled her senses, just as they entered the lane that led to a small clearing not far from Lucas and Sascha\u2019s home. \u201cYou taste of ice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s necessary,\u201d she said with manufactured calm. \u201cYou know it is.\u201d He\u2019d caught her in an active state not long before she left the den to spend several months with the cats, seen firsthand what she could do. She\u2019d chosen an isolated section to attempt her experiments at harnessing the fury of the X-marker, but an hour into it, she\u2019d turned around and there he was, a huge wolf, proud and beautiful.</p> <p>Now, he didn\u2019t answer as he brought the vehicle to a halt. Getting out, she took a deep breath, feeling as if she\u2019d escaped the lair of the very big, very bad wolf. Then she met Hawke\u2019s eyes across the hood of the SUV. Oh God. All eyes of ice blue and hair of silver-gold, he was her every fantasy come to life.</p><p>And he was focused on her to the exclusion of all else.</p><p>She wet dry lips, saw his eyes follow the movement. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>A faint smile that made every tiny hair on her body rise in quivering attention. \u201cHow fast can you run?\u201d A wolf\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running from you.\u201d She held her ground.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Pushing off the SUV, he led the way to the cabin.</p><p>\u201cYou need to go away while I\u2019m talking with Sascha,\u201d she said after she was certain the wolf wasn\u2019t about to make good on its threat.</p><p>To her surprise, he made no argument. \u201cI\u2019ll go for a run. Luc doesn\u2019t like me close to Sascha at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Startled, she looked toward where the DarkRiver alpha was waiting with his mate, a small light illuminating the outdoor seating area. \u201cI thought you two had trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis mate is pregnant. It changes the balance.\u201d Raising his hand in hello to the alpha couple, he glanced at her. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in an hour. Enough time?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t trust his sudden cooperation but tried to keep her own tone just as businesslike. \u201cTwenty more minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Then he was gone, a sleek shadow in the dark.</p><p>Her heart slipped the vise of her rigid mental control to slam against her chest at witnessing his incredible speed. If Hawke ever did chase her, she\u2019d better hope she had one hell of a head start. Then again, it might be more fun to get caught.</p><p>\u201cSienna.\u201d Lucas\u2019s voice broke through her stunned realization that she wasn\u2019t as averse to the idea of playing prey to Hawke\u2019s wolf as she\u2019d thought.</p><p>Closing the distance to the cabin, she smiled, hoping her distraction didn\u2019t show. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrab a seat.\u201d The leopard rose from his own chair. \u201cI\u2019ll stay out of earshot and make sure the sentinels are, too.\u201d</p><p>Sienna knew the reason for the courtesy was because his mating bond with Sascha meant he\u2019d know the instant she felt in any way threatened. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Lucas left with silent feline grace. Getting to her feet at the same instant, Sascha motioned for Sienna to follow her inside. \u201cWarmer there. Plus, I have your favorite chocolate-caramel slice.\u201d</p><p>A spark of childish joy. \u201cReally?\u201d It was hard for her to resist sweets\u2014in the Net, she\u2019d been disallowed anything sensual, including food. Since getting out, she wanted to gorge. On food, on feeling . . . but mostly on Hawke.</p><p>Heat bloomed low in her body, and she had to focus to catch Sascha\u2019s next words.</p><p>\u201cI had Lucas hide it in the aerie before the sentinels got here for a meeting tonight. Otherwise\u201d\u2014a warm laugh\u2014\u201cyou\u2019d have been lucky to scrape up a crumb. Sit. I\u2019ll get the tea.\u201d</p><p>Sienna nudged Sascha down instead. \u201cI\u2019ll do it\u2014I know where everything is.\u201d Bringing the pot to the table, she put it aside to steep while Sascha cut the slice.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d the empath said, putting the rich chocolaty treat on her plate, \u201cHawke wants to chase you.\u201d</p><p>Sienna froze. \u201cLucas heard that from all the way over here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. And Hawke knew he would.\u201d</p><p>It took Sienna several seconds to process the implications of that statement. \u201cHe told me flat out that there couldn\u2019t be anything between us.\u201d Yet he\u2019d just come perilously close to staking another claim.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d It was a relief to be able to talk this over with Sascha. While Indigo had become her friend and guide in many ways, Hawke was the one subject Sienna hesitated to discuss with her, not wanting to put the lieutenant in an awkward position.</p><p>\u201cI heard what happened at Wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could still kick him for that.\u201d Pouring the tea, she pushed one of the quirky tulip-shaped cups toward Sascha. \u201cHe treated me as if I was ten years old.\u201d Except for when he\u2019d tapped her butt, kept his hand there. Her thighs clenched at the memory.</p><p>\u201cThere is that, isn\u2019t there?\u201d Sascha\u2019s tone was gentle. \u201cThe age issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I can do about that. I\u2019m always going to be younger.\u201d Afraid she\u2019d break the teacup with the force of her grip, she put it down. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, voice vibrating with feeling, \u201cI\u2019ve not only survived and gained control of my abilities, I\u2019ve done so outside the PsyNet. Hardly the act of a child.\u201d She\u2019d earned the right to live her life as she pleased. \u201cI\u2019m not about to let His Wolf Highness disregard all that because it makes it easier for him to not recognize\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sienna bit off her words, but Sascha didn\u2019t need them. From the moment she\u2019d seen the young X with Hawke, she\u2019d felt it, that tug between them. It had had no name at the start, no definition. Even now, it remained a raw, nameless thing, but it was powerful. Powerful enough to have Hawke overriding his own decisions about keeping Sienna at a distance, powerful enough to have dragged him out of the shadows.</p><p>The first time Sascha had touched Hawke with her empathic senses, she\u2019d felt such blood rage she\u2019d been staggered by it. This man, she\u2019d thought, would never love, not so long as that anger was a red haze across his vision. But then she\u2019d seen him with Sienna. Month by month, year by year, the strange alchemy of their adversarial relationship had removed the poison of that anger until what remained was a gleaming, honed blade, still lethal, but far healthier.</p><p>However, Sascha had sensed something else that night when Hawke asked her to prove her claim to the E-designation. It was a truth she\u2019d never say aloud, an empathic secret she\u2019d never share, but there was a deep loneliness within the wolf alpha, a part of himself he kept separate even from his beloved pack. If Sienna could reach that wild, broken heart . . .</p><p>\u201cAn alpha,\u201d Sascha began, wanting to give the other cardinal all the help she could, \u201cneeds his woman to come to him stripped bare of all pretense. No barriers. No emotional shields. I am the one person Lucas knows is his without question, the one person who will stand by him no matter what, who\u2019ll tell him the truth even if it\u2019s harsh.\u201d</p><p>Sienna, to her credit, didn\u2019t shy from the frank discussion. Instead, those starlit eyes turned midnight in intense concentration. \u201cWhat about the sentinels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too, is a rare kind of trust, but . . .\u201d The bond was near impossible to explain to someone else, but Sienna needed to understand, so Sascha found the words. \u201cWith me, he\u2019s never, ever my alpha. He\u2019s simply Lucas, the man who holds my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that . . . Doesn\u2019t that depth of vulnerability put you in a weaker position, given an alpha\u2019s natural dominance?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, because he gives the same back.\u201d Loved her with all the untamed power and fierce devotion of the panther\u2019s heart. \u201cHe gives more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can have that kind of a relationship with Hawke,\u201d Sienna murmured, \u201ceven if I manage to make him listen, make him see.\u201d Not discouragement, more a contemplative statement. \u201cHe\u2019s not like Lucas.\u201d</p><p>Sascha waited.</p> <p>\u201cI understand Lucas could and would kill me with a single blow if he considered me a threat to you or the rest of the pack,\u201d Sienna said, \u201cbut he smiles and laughs and plays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawke\u2019s done more than his share of teasing.\u201d Sascha couldn\u2019t count the number of times the wolf had flirted with her in order to annoy Lucas.</p><p>Sienna pushed the chocolate slice around her plate. \u201cHe never plays with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWolves have a strange sense of play according to my mate.\u201d Sascha shook her head. \u201cHe lets you drive him crazy, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe punished me.\u201d</p> <p>Sascha laughed at the disgruntled statement. \u201cYou probably deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did.\u201d A scowl that Sascha guessed was self-directed. \u201cBut he\u2019s given me the green light to ignore the hierarchy while we\u2019re alone together.\u201d</p><p>Sascha sat up, her amazement so huge that the baby kicked, wanting in on the secret. Smoothing her hand over her belly at the same time that she soothed their child\u2019s active mind, she used her other hand to touch Sienna\u2019s. \u201cIn that case,\u201d she said, hope a brilliant spark inside of her, \u201cambush him if you have to, but get him alone.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>ALMOST READY FOR her date, Lara smoothed the dress over her hips. It was a bright sunshine yellow, an impulse buy she\u2019d been certain would spend a short life languishing in her closet before she gave it away. But Drew of all people had convinced her to give it a go, and what do you know, it looked stunning against the natural dark tan of her skin.</p><p>The design itself wasn\u2019t fancy. The dress had a simple square neck and thick straps, the bodice fitted down to her waist, where it flared out in a gentle swirl. A feminine dress reminiscent of the 1950s, she thought, putting on earrings she\u2019d bought from a street stall during a trip to New York. The tiny fall of sunflowers glinted cheerfully through the corkscrew curls of her black hair.</p> <p>After slipping on a thin gold bracelet, she pulled on the strappy sandals she\u2019d bought on the same frustration-and-nervous-anticipation-fueled shopping trip that had resulted in the yellow dress. A wrap to ward off the evening air and a sweet little vintage purse beaded with vibrant color finished off the look. Maybe she\u2019d never win any modeling awards, she thought with determined confidence, but she looked pretty.</p><p>The knock came a second later.</p><p>Opening the door, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re right on time,\u201d to the man on the other side.</p><p>Kieran flashed that trademark playful smile of his, a deep dimple creasing one cheek. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want to be late when I finally got the prettiest woman in the den to agree to go on a date.\u201d</p><p>With his skin a lighter shade of brown than her own and hypnotic gray-green eyes courtesy of his Tajik father, Kieran was an unashamed flirt. He was also several years younger than her and had broken more hearts in the den than most of the other men combined . . . but Kieran also knew how to make a woman feel beautiful, desired.</p><p>Tonight, after not having been out with a man for six months\u2014since the first night Walker had stopped by for a late-night coffee\u2014Lara needed to feel exactly that. \u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that Italian restaurant by Wild. I know you love their gelato.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did your homework.\u201d She slid her arm into his, appreciating him though he didn\u2019t make her wolf freeze in quiet, panicked anticipation when he was near, didn\u2019t make her heart skip a beat.</p> <p>Kieran responded as they rounded the corner, but his words were lost in the crash of white noise inside her head. She saw Walker coming down the corridor, the faded blue of his jeans a contrast to the deep navy of his shirt. Masculine and confident, he walked with the stride of a man at ease with his body . . . a body that was all lean muscle and strength.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen him since their conversation in the forest, though she knew he\u2019d come looking for her the other night. It was pure luck she hadn\u2019t been in\u2014but even if she had been, she would\u2019ve handled it. The time for avoiding Walker was over, and while she couldn\u2019t see them resuming their friendship, there was no reason they couldn\u2019t maintain a cordial relationship. \u201cHi,\u201d she said when he stopped.</p><p>Those light green eyes skimmed over her and to Kieran, before returning to her. \u201cThe temperature\u2019s dropped,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should take a coat.\u201d</p><p>Kieran laughed, slid his arm around her. \u201cHey, man, if she has a coat, how am I supposed to use the cold to get her to cuddle close?\u201d</p><p>Walker left with a curt nod.</p><p>It was only after he was gone that Lara realized she\u2019d stopped breathing.</p><p>HAWKE had meant to stay the hell away from Sienna after he returned from visiting Theresa. So he had no idea why he was waiting for her at the car ninety minutes after having dropped her off, anticipation a slow burn in every cell of his body.</p><p>It was no surprise to see Lucas walking toward him. \u201cDid you get my message?\u201d the leopard alpha asked as he got closer.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Revised evac plan looks good to me.\u201d On one point he and Lucas were in glorious agreement\u2014it was damn fine to have a sentinel-lieutenant mating. Not that Riley and Mercy particularly enjoyed their glee. \u201cIt\u2019ll get everyone out faster.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shoved a hand through his shoulder-length hair. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t need to consider an evacuation from our own land, but the bastards have been getting smarter and more focused with each attempt. Learning more about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have we. If it does come down to war, it\u2019s going to be a level playing field.\u201d That wasn\u2019t false confidence\u2014Hawke had made certain SnowDancer would never again be a defenseless target. He\u2019d been fifteen when he\u2019d taken control of the pack, but he\u2019d understood the grim reality of Psy power better than anyone, his childhood having ended in a spray of blood and betrayal caused by the cold psychic race.</p><p>Then, he\u2019d hated them all. Now he knew it was only the Council and its flunkies that were the enemy. \u201cI was thinking I should go say hello to Sascha darling.\u201d In truth, his mind was on another woman, one with hair of ruby red and a mouth that had a way of saying things that both amused and incensed his wolf.</p><p>\u201cGo for it.\u201d Unruffled words, eyes gleaming cat-green.</p><p>Hawke smiled, his wolf finding the idea of poking at the leopard alpha an amusing distraction from his compulsion to run a certain Psy to ground. \u201cWhat if she invites me? I should call out, let her know I\u2019d like to see her.\u201d</p><p>A languid shrug. \u201cIf you want your teeth in your gullet, go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure you want to make Sascha mad?\u201d The wolf laughed husky and low at Lucas\u2019s battle-ready stance. \u201cI am one of her favorite people, after all.\u201d</p><p>Instead of snarling, the other alpha started to smile a very feline kind of a smile. \u201cYou know, I think maybe I should invite Kit over. He\u2019d love to see Sienna again.\u201d</p><p>Hawke growled before he could stop himself. The damn leopard grinned.</p><p>\u201cFunny,\u201d Hawke muttered.</p><p>\u201cFrom my perspective, it was hilarious.\u201d Lucas unfolded his arms, sliding his hands into the pockets of the black cargo pants he wore with a T-shirt of a shade that matched his eyes. Hawke knew without asking that Sascha had bought that T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not dating, but he\u2019s very protective of her,\u201d Lucas said as Hawke was about to rib him on his sartorial elegance in retaliation for the other man\u2019s quip, \u201cjust so you know.\u201d</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t bother to respond to that\u2014he\u2019d eat the baby cat alpha for breakfast. \u201cWhat did Jos\u00e9 say when you talked to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess.\u201d Lucas shook his head. \u201cCome over for a beer tomorrow afternoon. Sascha will be at Tammy\u2019s. We\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>It was strange, that he\u2019d become almost-friends with this alpha who\u2019d once been an adversary. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can swing it. Might have a comm-meeting.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded the instant before Hawke caught the first hint of an exquisitely familiar scent on the breeze. Autumn leaves and spice and strength. His wolf stretched out at the intoxication of it. Maybe she wasn\u2019t his mate, but the animal wasn\u2019t bothered. It still wanted the man to take her, to claim her. To bite her.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>\u201cDid you two have a good visit?\u201d Lucas asked, walking over to touch the back of his hand to Sienna\u2019s cheek in a gentle caress.</p><p>The only reason Hawke\u2019s wolf didn\u2019t eviscerate the other male was because Lucas\u2019s mate was walking with Sienna. And Sascha could get even a demon to behave. Mostly. \u201cHello, Sascha darling,\u201d he murmured, dropping his voice into bedroom territory. \u201cMiss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrible man,\u201d Sascha said, trying to get around her mate. Lucas refused to let her pass. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d But she allowed Luc to wrap her in his arms, press his lips to her temple.</p><p>\u201cDid I ever tell you I knew another empath once?\u201d Hawke said, buying himself time to temper his response to Sienna. \u201cShe was part of SnowDancer when I was a child, mated to a wolf long before Silence.\u201d Zia had been near to a hundred and thirty, a low-Gradient E, but one of the first to notice that something was wrong in the pack. If only people had listened.</p><p>Sascha\u2019s eyes went huge. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t! Why don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas squeezed her. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to lure you with his stories. Go away, wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas!\u201d</p><p>Sienna was smiling as she looked at the couple, but that smile faded when she met his gaze.</p><p>It made him wonder what she saw. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She got into the SUV without a word, and they headed off after waving good-bye to Lucas and Sascha. Uncomfortable as his relationship was with Sienna, Hawke liked being around her\u2014a fact he was positive would surprise her. But when she wasn\u2019t fighting with him, she was smart, with a wit the wolf found endlessly amusing. \u201cWant to go for a run?\u201d he asked as they hit the edge of den territory. \u201cI promise not to chase you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A lush burst of feminine arousal had him gritting his teeth to fight his body\u2019s instinctive response. \u201cI\u2019m nowhere near fast as you,\u201d she said at last. \u201cNot like Judd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have to go fast.\u201d He shrugged, the wolf happy because she hadn\u2019t said no. \u201cSometimes, it\u2019s just about feeling the wind against your face, the earth under your feet.\u201d</p><p>She tugged the sleeves of her checked shirt to her fingertips. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold out.\u201d The Sierra Nevada had slipped into the quiet beauty of night, the heat of the sun\u2019s rays long gone. \u201cThere should be a sweatshirt in the back you can wear.\u201d</p><p>Twisting in her seat, she reached for the sweatshirt . . . and her music player. Shooting him a dirty look, she put the little device in the space on the dash and undid her safety belt long enough to pull on the large gray sweatshirt.</p><p>That quickly, she was covered in his scent.</p><p>Watching her roll up the sleeves to her wrists, he hid his possessive satisfaction behind a lazy comment. \u201cYou\u2019re kinda small, Sienna.\u201d She never seemed that way, her personality that of someone much larger and stronger\u2014he bet if he asked people in the den to describe her, most would give her at least half a foot of extra height, more muscle.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re too big.\u201d She continued to fold up the sleeves with methodical precision.</p> <p>Grinning at being so politely insulted, he didn\u2019t say anything until he\u2019d parked the vehicle a little ways from the den. Sienna was more than strong enough to cover the remaining distance on foot. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>She was already opening her door. \u201cI don\u2019t recognize this area.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t surprised. Den territory was a vast, sprawling wilderness, most of it inaccessible to vehicles\u2014and unlike the wolves, Sienna couldn\u2019t explore as much area on foot. \u201cI want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>She clambered over a fallen tree on the path, and he had to stop himself from reaching over and picking her up, caressing her waist with his hands as he slid her oh-so-slowly to her feet. Her movements were smooth and lithe\u2014Indigo had done a good job with her training, but it was Sienna\u2019s will that had led to her becoming as good as she was. Hawke knew the offensive capability of each and every soldier in the pack, and\u2014putting aside her psychic abilities\u2014Sienna was exceptional for someone who wasn\u2019t changeling.</p><p>\u201cA little farther,\u201d he said when they reached a stand of conifers intertwined with a delicate dark green vine.</p><p>Picking up a small pinecone off the forest floor, Sienna rubbed her thumb over the rough edges. \u201cAre you doing anything tomorrow night?\u201d</p> <p>He caught the nervous bite in her scent, caught, too, the determination. His gut clenched. \u201cSienna.\u201d Hurting her was the last thing he wanted to do, but he wouldn\u2019t lead her on. \u201cI have plans.\u201d</p><p>Cardinal eyes slammed into his. \u201cRosalie?\u201d A single frigid word.</p><p>His wolf peeled back its lips. \u201cShe\u2019s an adult wolf, who happens to be a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to an immature girl you can\u2019t stand.\u201d A challenge, the gauntlet thrown.</p><p>He picked it up. \u201cI need something she can give me.\u201d Rosalie was wolf enough to accept and offer the physical intimacy his own wolf craved without expecting a depth of commitment he simply couldn\u2019t give . . . and much as he valued her friendship, Rosalie didn\u2019t tempt him to brand her with his claim, even knowing it would destroy her in the end.</p><p>THE pinecone dug into Sienna\u2019s palm, but she hardly felt it against the pain of the body blow Hawke had just delivered. Why had she asked the question when she\u2019d known the answer? It was nothing a Psy\u2014a true Psy\u2014would\u2019ve ever done. But when it came to this man, she had as little control as the child he called her. \u201cIs it enough?\u201d she asked with a fury that sought to draw blood. \u201cJust the physical act.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try and bring it down to that.\u201d Cold, cold words. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in the den long enough to know we don\u2019t use each other.\u201d</p><p>No, they didn\u2019t. That made it so much harder to bear. With wolves, sexual contact was warm and joyful and treasured. Rosalie would lie with Hawke with a packmate\u2019s genuine affection, luxuriating in having a partner who could ease her own physical needs so very well\u2014because while Sienna might be inexperienced, she understood that Hawke would never leave a woman unsatisfied. He was too much the dominant male to accept anything but total erotic surrender in bed.</p> <p>And when he and Rosalie parted, whether it was after a day or after a month, it would be with smiles and laughter. She\u2019d seen the same with other members of the pack, knew that several of her friends were involved in affectionate, sensual relationships that wouldn\u2019t be permanent\u2014but would be respected and cherished.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she forced herself to say, nausea curdling her stomach. \u201cThat was uncalled for.\u201d Chest so tight it ached, she said, \u201cIs this the way to the den?\u201d glad that her voice came out calm, betraying none of the hurt that had her curling into a fetal ball inside her mind. Because it didn\u2019t matter how much time alone she had with him if she had to spend her nights knowing those strong hands were stroking over another woman\u2019s skin, another woman\u2019s breasts.</p><p>\u201cNo\u201d\u2014his voice a slow caress, an unintended taunt\u2014\u201cit\u2019s a small detour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to go back.\u201d At that moment, the last thing she wanted was to be here, with him, not when she could almost hate him for what he was able to do to her.</p><p>\u201cThrowing a tantrum, Sienna?\u201d Ruthless words, that caressing tone suddenly a blade. \u201cI thought you\u2019d retired the spoiled brat act.\u201d</p><p>How would you feel if the woman you wanted beyond all others planned to take another man into her bed? She didn\u2019t yell the words, holding on to her tattered pride. Enough. Just . . . enough. Some things, a woman could not accept and live with herself. \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d she asked in a voice touched with ice. \u201cWhy are we walking under the stars, late at night?\u201d</p><p>Wolf-pale eyes gleaming at her in the dark, the gaze of a man used to getting exactly what he wanted. \u201cWe\u2019re packmates. It\u2019s a beautiful night. Simple as that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d A harsh renunciation that scraped her throat raw. \u201cYou\u2019re giving me just enough to make sure I can\u2019t forget you and not enough to go against your all-important principles. Well, fuck you.\u201d Quiet, quiet words, because she would not scream and yell, would not allow him to see her break. \u201cI don\u2019t want the crumbs from your table.\u201d Turning on her heel, she started heading through the trees in the direction she thought would lead home.</p><p>\u201cSienna.\u201d</p><p>She could not, would not, stop. If she did, he\u2019d see the tears burning at the backs of her eyes, see what he did to her, and her humiliation would be complete.</p><p>\u201cStop right now.\u201d</p><p>The words were right against her ear, the wolf having moved with preternatural speed. It was too much. She snapped.</p><p>HAWKE was about to close his hand around Sienna\u2019s nape when she twisted to face him, her eyes devoid of stars. Knowing what she could do, he expected an attack, but she took a deep breath, dropped her head . . . and went up in flames.</p><p>A violent red licked with streamers of amber, the inferno gave off no heat, and yet he knew without a doubt that it was lethal beyond anything known to man. Fighting the wolf\u2019s frenzied attempts to reach out, to protect, he forced himself to stand in place and look, really look. She was fine inside the blaze. No, not fine. Every muscle in her body was rigid, her hair blowing off her face in a savage psychic breeze, but whatever the fire demanded from her, her skin remained untouched.</p><p>Even being able to see her safe, the ten seconds she spent in the heart of flame were the longest of his life. \u201cDo that again,\u201d he growled the instant the fire blinked out, \u201cand I swear I\u2019ll throw you into the lake.\u201d</p><p>She raised her head, embers continuing to flicker in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d</p><p>The wolf wasn\u2019t used to being so flatly challenged. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d He\u2019d seen her exercising her ability before, but never like this, until she was consumed by it.</p><p>\u201cA simple energy release.\u201d She began to walk away from him again.</p><p>His wolf saw red. \u201cBaby, if\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Call. Me. Baby.\u201d Turning on her heel, she stared at him, her gaze potent with such destructive power, lesser men might\u2019ve trembled.</p><p>But he was an alpha wolf, and if Sienna thought she was going to make him back off, she had another thing coming. \u201cI\u2019ll call you anything I damn well please.\u201d He stepped into her personal space, until she had to either step back or have her breasts brush against his chest with every breath.</p><p>She held her ground, paradoxically pleasing the wolf. \u201cThe only man,\u201d she said, her words wrapped in that cold darkness he hadn\u2019t seen in her since the first few days after her defection, \u201cI\u2019ll allow to use that particular endearment will be my lover. You are no longer in the running for the position.\u201d</p><p>The rage that tore through him was a ravaging beast full of claws and teeth. But he bit back the primal demands that wanted to escape. And said the words that would keep her with him a while longer. Yeah, he was a selfish prick, but he\u2019d never argued otherwise. Not when it came to Sienna Lauren. \u201cI\u2019ve never shown anyone else this spot.\u201d</p><p>The cold dark retreated to reveal the stars in her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re playing me.\u201d A stark vulnerability in her face, her soul stripped bare.</p><p>It didn\u2019t rock him how much he wanted what he saw in her\u2014the need had become an unrelenting ache by now. \u201cDoesn\u2019t make it any less true.\u201d His wolf waited, tense.</p><p>When she fell into step beside him again, he clenched his hand to keep from reaching out to fist it in the jewel-dark silk of her hair, to tug her close, close enough that he could rub his face against it . . . close enough that he could pet and cajole her into melting into him. \u201cDo all Xs have hair like yours?\u201d he asked, needing to hear the sound of her voice if he couldn\u2019t have the touch of her skin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A genuinely startled glance. \u201cI don\u2019t know.

Yes, her hair fit. \u201cTell me about your abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot from you.\u201d Judd had given him the low-down, instructed him on what to do if Sienna ever went critical and the others in the LaurenNet were incapacitated. His wolf snarled. Hawke had made some ruthless decisions in his time, but he didn\u2019t know if he had it in him to cause her that kind of hurt, the kind that would slam her into immediate unconsciousness.</p><p>There was a long silence from the woman by his side. As the minutes passed, he began to hear faint rustling in the undergrowth, nocturnal creatures starting to go about their business again after the brutal blast of Sienna\u2019s power. \u201cThey call it cold fire . . . X-fire,\u201d she said at last. \u201cIt can burn things to ash . . . bodies to ash, within microseconds.\u201d</p><p>He heard old pain in her words. \u201cWere you a child?\u201d</p><p>A rough nod, but she jerked away from his touch, refusing comfort. Her voice, when it came, told him they wouldn\u2019t be talking about her childhood pain. It was coated in frost, but he heard the tremor beneath. \u201cThe cold fire is the first wave. The power has the capacity to build until it reaches\u2014\u201d</p><p>Another silence, his heartbeat synchronizing with her own.</p> <p>\u201cSynergy, it\u2019s called synergy. If I ever reach synergy\u2014\u201d A sharp inhalation. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason they call us living, breathing weapons.\u201d Turning to him for the first time since she\u2019d begun to speak, she shot him a piercing look. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about the pack being in danger. It does sometimes scare me that I\u2019ll lose control,\u201d she said with raw honesty, \u201cbut that means I spend even more time strengthening my shields. We also have a failsafe set in place just in case.\u201d</p><p>Understanding that that failsafe might well be a lethal one, he said, \u201cDo you really think I\u2019d let you go that easily?\u201d</p><p>An implacable glance from eyes that were suddenly decades older than him. \u201cI\u2019m not yours to let go.\u201d</p><p>RECOVERED FROM COMPUTER 2(A) TAGS: PERSONAL CORRESPONDENCE, FATHER, ACTION NOT REQUIRED</p><p>FROM: Alice &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p> <p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>TO: Dad &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>DATE: November 18th, 1971 at 10:32am</p><p>SUBJECT: re: re: re: JA Article</p><p>Dear Dad,</p><p>Thank you for your last e-mail. Yes, you\u2019re right. What I\u2019m doing, it may one day help the Xs. That\u2019s what I must cling to as things get harder.</p> <p>This is just a quick note as I\u2019m in Paris, about to head out to meet one of my volunteers. He\u2019s a fascinating boy\u2014intelligent, witty, and far too calm for his age. I\u2019ve noticed that with all the Xs I\u2019ve met in person. I hate to write this, to recognize the reason behind it, but it\u2019s as if they live their lives in fast-forward, growing old before they\u2019ve ever been young.</p><p>I\u2019ll write again after the meeting.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Alice</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>IT WAS LATE afternoon, with both Toby and Marlee involved in after-school activities, when Walker cornered Lara in the break room of the infirmary, shutting the door behind himself.</p><p>Having obviously scented him as he neared, she leaned against the counter, arms folded. \u201cYes?\u201d Her eyes, a tawny shade of brown that reminded him of a fox\u2019s bright gaze, held nothing but professional interest. \u201cIs someone hurt?\u201d</p><p>He echoed her position against the door, making an unexpected discovery\u2014he\u2019d gotten used to the way Lara had looked at him until the day on the cliff. It caused a strange, sharp sensation in his chest to no longer see that indefinable something in her gaze. \u201cHow was your date?\u201d he asked, not certain why he felt compelled to ask.</p><p>Lara\u2019s smile was a sultry curve of her lips. \u201cKieran knows how to make a woman feel good.\u201d</p><p>An icy calm came over Walker\u2019s mind, cold intent spearing through his veins. He was a telepath trained to work with children, his touch subtle, but he measured at 7.8 on the Gradient. It meant he had the capacity to kill without leaving a mark. \u201cHe\u2019s younger than you.\u201d Too weak and green to ensure Lara came to no harm, regardless of where her vocation might take her.</p><p>Lara shrugged, her full breasts pushing against the rust-colored fabric of the V-neck sweater that shaped itself to the curves of her body. \u201cNot by much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>Turning, she began to prepare coffee with swift, sure movements of those capable hands he\u2019d seen care for so many in the den. \u201cI won\u2019t argue he\u2019s a little immature, but aren\u2019t most men in their early twenties?\u201d</p><p>Walker knew she\u2019d given him her back very much deliberately, the rebuff no less pointed for all it was silent. However, the only orders Walker had ever followed were the ones that meant his family would be safe. \u201cHe has no idea who you are.\u201d Even at thirty, Lara was young, very young, to be the healer assigned to the den.</p><p>Unlike most packs, SnowDancer had more than one healer spread throughout its vast territory, each blood-bonded to a SnowDancer lieutenant to permit a type of power transference unique to changelings. Though several had decades on Lara, who was blood-bonded directly to Hawke, she held their unqualified trust and respect. Her healing abilities were unparalleled, but more, she had the will and the heart to handle the most dominant members of the pack without flinching. That woman deserved a man as strong, not a callow youth.</p><p>\u201cReally, Walker,\u201d Lara said, facing him with coffee cup in hand, several of her curls having escaped the bun at the base of her neck to kiss her face. \u201cYou\u2019d think I was going to mate with Kieran.\u201d Blowing a breath across the hot surface of her drink, she stepped forward, her smile so shallow, it cut like a scalpel. \u201cI need to check on a patient.\u201d</p><p>He had the feeling she was lying to him, but he couldn\u2019t be certain, so he permitted her to pass, the warm elegance of her scent stroking over him as she left. She was halfway to the patient rooms when she glanced back and caught him with that fox-brown gaze. \u201cSometimes,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s just about sex.\u201d</p><p>SIENNA had the afternoon free, but after completing the coursework for an advanced physics class she was taking through the online branch of a major university, she decided to head out to the White Zone and volunteer to assist with the after-school activities. As she walked, she tried to keep her mind on dry academic facts, but it was impossible not to think of the emotional storm and dark beauty of the previous night.</p><p>The moss-laden grotto Hawke had led her to after the cold burn of her ability had encased her in violent flame had been alive with night-blooming wildflowers, the small pond at the center so tranquil and clear as to be a mirror. Her soul had filled with wonder as she touched her fingertips to a delicate bloom, her heart aching with the realization that he was giving her a gift, giving her a piece of himself he\u2019d never shown to another.</p><p>It had threatened to break her. Because no matter how drawn he was to her, no matter how potent the tug between them, Hawke had a will of iron. That will would have him shredding her to bloody pieces tonight as he put his hands on another woman. As he kissed her. More.</p><p>\u201cSinna!\u201d Ben skidded to a halt at her feet not far into the White Zone, breaking the agonizing loop of thought. \u201cHi!\u201d He threw his arms wide.</p><p>Going down on her haunches, she cuddled him tight, whispering, \u201cDo you want me to do up your shoelace?\u201d in his ear.</p><p>A furtive nod.</p><p>Smiling at the male pride that wouldn\u2019t let Ben admit the need for help to the other kids, she did up the dangling lace, then rose to her feet to find herself being called upon to referee a game of hide-and-seek. Drew tracked her down there ten minutes later. \u201cHello, sugarpie.\u201d Wrapping an arm around her shoulders, he tugged her into the warmth of his body even as she scowled at the ridiculous pet name he\u2019d given her after discovering\u2014and feeding\u2014her addiction to sweets.</p><p>\u201cTemper, temper.\u201d A finger tapping her nose. \u201cPlay nice or I won\u2019t give you the pecan-and-nougat candy bar somebody really loves.\u201d</p><p>In spite of the pain wracking her insides, it was impossible not to smile at this man who\u2019d claimed her as a sister, who\u2019d laughed, tricked, and teased his way into her life. \u201cI thought you were in Arizona with the falcons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot back a couple of hours ago.\u201d He slid the candy bar into her pocket.</p><p>Leaning into him, she sniffed, loud and obvious. \u201cHmm, freshly showered. What did you do when you got back?\u201d</p><p>Drew gave her a wicked, wicked smile that creased his cheeks with lean male dimples. \u201cWell now, I\u2019ll just leave that to your imagination, Ms. Sienna Lauren.\u201d</p><p>Laughter bubbled out of her, pumping through the giant bruise that was her heart. \u201cYou like being mated.\u201d He\u2019d always been one of the most easygoing people in the den, but there was a fierce happiness to him now, his adoration of Indigo open.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He lifted a finger to his lips when a little girl poked her head around the bush where she was hiding. She ducked back. \u201cI\u2019ve come to give you some sage advice, being as I\u2019m so much older and wiser.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the man who once stole Indigo\u2019s phone and recorded himself howling her name as the ringtone.\u201d</p><p>His responding words were unexpectedly serious. \u201cI had the same problem as you.\u201d</p><p>Sienna went to snap back a reply but closed her mouth partway. \u201cYes . . . you did.\u201d Drew was only four years younger than Indigo, but he didn\u2019t occupy the same place in the hierarchy. It had made his courtship of the lieutenant difficult.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give up.\u201d</p><p>Stung, she pulled away. \u201cI\u2019m not giving up.\u201d She\u2019d asked Hawke to be with her, been rejected with such finality she was still bleeding inside.</p><p>\u201cI dunno, sweetheart.\u201d Drew rubbed his jaw, his gaze astute for all that his comment was a lazy drawl. \u201cFrom where I\u2019m standing, it sure as hell looks like you\u2019re giving Rosalie and Hawke the green light.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cold fire licked at her fingertips. Smothering it in her palm, she checked to make sure the kids were happy in their game before hissing a response under her breath. \u201cI\u2019d like to point out that you had a more powerful platform.\u201d Drew might not be a lieutenant, but Sienna had seen the way Hawke and the others listened to him.</p><p>\u201cYeah, that does kinda suck for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me want to throw things at you.\u201d</p> <p>He hugged her again, before she could put some distance between them. Then the most sneaky wolf in the den lowered his voice and whispered, \u201cBut you\u2019ve got an advantage, sweetheart. You\u2019re already in his head. And you know how to mess with it.\u201d</p><p>HAVING spent the day buried in strategy and preparation sessions for a war that seemed inevitable, Hawke didn\u2019t get outside until after night had fallen in a lush black blanket. He was at the lake nearest the den, staring at the gentle lap of water when Rosalie appeared out of the trees to make her way across the pebbled shore. Her walk was that of a woman confident in her sensuality\u2014the complete opposite of the cardinal Psy who watched him with an unstudied hunger that had almost broken his resolve last night.</p><p>A single touch and he would\u2019ve had her naked in the silver kiss of the moonlight, her back cushioned by the softness of the lush green grass, her hair a ruby red flame over the wildflowers. So vivid was the image that the wolf growled, wanting to take control, to go hunting its favorite prey.</p><p>\u201cThat is not,\u201d Rosalie said, fitting her tall, voluptuous body to his side, \u201cthe look of a man who can\u2019t wait to get me into bed.\u201d</p><p>He played his fingers through her hair, and though the thick, mahogany waves were beautiful, his mind kept circling back to the dark fall of silk he\u2019d seen under the moon last night. \u201cYou\u2019re too good for me, Rosa.\u201d</p> <p>A husky laugh. \u201cOf course I am.\u201d She pressed a kiss to his jaw, her breasts brushing his chest as she shifted to face him. \u201cI can feel your wolf tugging at the reins.\u201d</p><p>Hawke hated that he was being pushed into this by the physical needs of his changeling nature. But that had nothing to do with Rosalie. \u201cI\u2019m a bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are,\u201d she agreed, linking her arms around his neck.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWow, talk about alpha. Makes me want to say \u2018yes, please and again.\u2019 \u201d Tracing his lips with her fingertip, she gave him a solemn look from those thickly lashed eyes of deepest green. \u201cYou know this, us, it\u2019s freely given? No strings.\u201d</p><p>Instead of lunging at the invitation as he\u2019d half expected, Hawke\u2019s wolf sat sullen, though it was being torn apart by the most savage sexual need. \u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>She tipped her head to the side, her hair cascading over her shoulder. \u201cThen why aren\u2019t you ripping my clothes off?\u201d There was no judgment in the words, only the concern of a friend.</p><p>Reaching up, he brushed his fingers over her cheekbone. The wolf found her sensual, beautiful, intelligent. The man agreed. There was just one problem. \u201cIndigo was right\u201d\u2014a realization that tilted his world on its axis\u2014\u201cit won\u2019t satisfy my hunger.\u201d The need that ravaged him was hotly specific, targeted to only one woman.</p><p>\u201cYou mean,\u201d Rosalie said, hands on her hips, \u201cyou\u2019re blowing me off after getting me all hot and bothered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mad?\u201d He nuzzled at her, because the wolf didn\u2019t want to hurt her.</p><p>Rosalie laughed, and it was a big, sensual sound from a woman who lived her life with a generosity of spirit that didn\u2019t allow her to hold grudges. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly a surprise, sweetie.\u201d Still smiling, she kissed him full on the mouth. \u201cI came to you because we\u2019re friends\u2014you needed touch, and I figured you were too stubborn to go after her. I didn\u2019t realize it had gotten to this point between you two.\u201d</p><p>Hawke growled at the implied conclusion in her statement. \u201cJust because I realize the need, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to act on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me make sure I have this right.\u201d Rosalie poked him in the chest. \u201cYou want her so bad I can all but taste your arousal\u2014and damn, but it\u2019s sexy\u2014but you\u2019re not hunting her down?\u201d</p><p>Hawke thought of how young Sienna was, how untried.</p> <p>I have no plans to die a virgin.</p><p>He was no lover for a virgin, especially now, with his control so ragged it was in fucking shreds. Hell, he\u2019d probably scare her so bad she\u2019d never want to have sex again. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Rosalie didn\u2019t sound convinced, but his sat phone rang before she could grill him any further.</p><p>Answering it, he was surprised to hear Jos\u00e9\u2019s voice. \u201cIt\u2019s Luc\u2019s turn,\u201d he said curtly, in no mood to babysit packmates who should know better. If they got into shit tonight, he\u2019d let them cool their heels in jail.</p><p>The bar owner blew out a breath. \u201cI\u2019m thinking you don\u2019t want another man handling your girl.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s claws sliced out. \u201cAnyone touches her, they\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine\u2014if you don\u2019t count the amount of alcohol she\u2019s slugging back . . . or the cat keeping her warm.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s growl rolled up out of his chest to color the air. \u201cMake damn sure she doesn\u2019t leave with him.\u201d Stabbing the End button, he looked up to find Rosalie grinning from ear to ear. \u201cQuiet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m just an innocent bystander.\u201d She raised her hands. \u201cThough you might want to take off your mean face before you go get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can bloody well deal with it.\u201d It was a snarl.</p><p>SIENNA surreptitiously passed \u201cher\u201d sixth shot to Kit.</p><p>He made a face. \u201cDid you have to order this girly shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a girl, in case you failed to notice.\u201d The vodkas she\u2019d ordered earlier had been easier to get rid of\u2014the colorless liquid blended in with the empty or ice cube\u2013filled glasses the wait staff cleared away on a regular basis. The shots, on the other hand, would stick out.</p><p>Shuddering, Kit made quick work of the butterscotch liqueur and slid the glass over before anyone was the wiser as to who had taken the actual shot.</p><p>\u201cDear God that was foul.\u201d He gulped his beer. \u201cThat\u2019s the last one I\u2019m doing for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that should do the trick. Jos\u00e9\u2019s giving me the eye.\u201d Sienna smiled goofily at the bartender, playing drunk.</p><p>The big deer changeling gave her a stare as flat as any wolf\u2019s.</p><p>Deciding not to push her luck, she dipped her head toward Kit\u2014to find him looking unexpectedly serious. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve got strong feelings for Hawke,\u201d he said, angling his shoulders to face her, \u201cbut are you ready for where this, tonight, might lead?\u201d</p><p>Sienna had asked herself the same question and found only one answer. \u201cI\u2019ll never know unless he gives us a chance.\u201d She closed her hand over Kit\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll discover I\u2019ve taken on more than I can handle,\u201d she admitted, because Hawke was never going to be an easy lover\u2014if she even got him to consider the idea of a relationship. \u201cBut I know, I know, that I can\u2019t sit by and watch him go to another woman.\u201d</p><p>An intent gaze. \u201cYou\u2019ve really thought about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Whatever happened, continuing on as they had\u2014with the relentless beat of unresolved tension between them\u2014was no longer an option. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not nervous.\u201d</p><p>Kit turned up his hand to squeeze hers, a feline smile in his eyes. \u201cMy money\u2019s on you.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward to press her lips to his cheek, she said, \u201cWhen should I climb on the bar again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven the time Jos\u00e9 made the call, and how fast Hawke is probably driving, I\u2019d say in about two minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Picking up her cell phone from where it sat on the bar, she tucked it into a back pocket, having not brought a purse. \u201cThat gives you two minutes to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not running.\u201d Pure affront.</p><p>Sienna had been in a pack long enough to understand male pride\u2014even stupid male pride. \u201cIt\u2019s not running. You\u2019ll mess up my whole plan if Hawke\u2019s focused on you instead of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Finishing off his beer, he rose off the barstool.</p><p>Then he did something completely, totally unexpected. Hauling her against his body, he took her mouth in a hot, wild tangle of a kiss that spoke of the man he would one day become. Her heart was pumping double-time by the time he finished. \u201cUm, well, that was . . .\u201d Okay, she thought, okay. Maybe they didn\u2019t have the combustible chemistry she had with Hawke, but Kit could get her into bed if he put his mind to it. And that was a surprise. \u201cNot nice,\u201d she finally managed to get out. \u201cA very \u2018not nice\u2019 kiss.\u201d</p><p>Smiling in masculine satisfaction, Kit rocked back on his heels. \u201cFair warning\u2014now you smell like me in an intimate way. He\u2019s not going to like that.\u201d</p><p>Cunning cat. Good thing he was on her side. \u201cShowtime.\u201d</p><p>Kit leaned in to speak with his lips brushing her ear. \u201cI won\u2019t be far. If he\u2019s too out of control, I\u2019ll get you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d Of that she was more certain than she was of anything else in her life. \u201cHaul me up.\u201d</p><p>Kit lifted her onto the bar beside another girl, a slender leopard female who blew Sienna a kiss. Whistles sounded from around the bar as Kit melted away, leaving the two of them silhouetted against the electric blue lights of the glass wall behind the bar, the bottles of alcohol so many glittering jewels against the glow. Well aware Nicki was only flirting with her to tease Jason, Sienna blew back a kiss, and the bar exploded.</p><p>The crowd was chanting \u201ckiss, kiss, kiss\u201d when Hawke walked inside.</p><p>That was when Sienna learned the meaning of the term alpha.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>HE DIDN\u2019T SAY a word, didn\u2019t so much as make a sound, but as soon as one person saw him, they nudged another. It took less than thirty seconds for the club to go deadly silent, Jos\u00e9 turning off the music at the same instant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nicki slid down the bar into Jason\u2019s arms, mouthing, \u201cGood luck,\u201d at Sienna before she disappeared into the group of DarkRiver youths in one corner.</p><p>Reaching the bar, Hawke looked up. It was the wolf who watched her, the wolf who said, \u201cShoulder or feet?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cFeet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood choice.\u201d He didn\u2019t step back as she sat down and slipped off the bar, his body heat slapping against her bare skin with masculine aggressiveness.</p><p>Suddenly, the corset-style top she\u2019d bought on her own after that shopping trip with Nicki didn\u2019t seem such a great idea. It left her feeling all but naked, her shoulders bare, her breasts plumped up above the bodice, her abdomen exposed from just below her belly button to the top of her low slung jeans. With her breath coming in jagged bursts, it felt as if she was offering her breasts to him with each inhale.</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t say a single word, gave no indication that he\u2019d noticed her state of dress as he put his hand on her lower back and herded her to the door.</p><p>She almost went.</p><p>Halfway there, she dug in her heels, determined to make him admit he wasn\u2019t just here to pick up a pack member who\u2019d had too much to drink. But one look at his face and she knew it\u2019d be a very bad idea to confront him here. She could see Nicki and Evie over his shoulder, frantically shaking their heads. Jason was wincing, but edging forward while Kit and Tai had begun to shoulder their way through the crowd\u2014as if to protect her.</p> <p>Their loyalty ignited a deep warmth with her.</p><p>But this was a private war.</p><p>Sliding her arm through Hawke\u2019s, she pressed her breast against the part of his arm bared by the short sleeves of his white T-shirt. \u201cWhere\u2019s the car?\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to slur her voice. His senses were too acute to have missed the fact that she was stone-cold sober.</p><p>In response, he untangled his arm from hers, put his hand on her lower back again\u2014the touch a hot, rough shock that made things low in her body clench\u2014and walked her out.</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d the bouncer muttered as she passed, not even making a token attempt at pretending he was going to stand in Hawke\u2019s way.</p><p>If she\u2019d been him, she wouldn\u2019t have either.</p> <p>Because unlike the other night, Hawke didn\u2019t look pissed. This was an anger that went deeper, ran far colder. Why the difference, she didn\u2019t know . . . until they got to beside the SUV, and he leaned down to growl, \u201cYou smell of another man.\u201d</p><p>Her body flared with sensation at the heat of him so close, but she wasn\u2019t about to surrender and lose the ground she\u2019d gained. \u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m not a wolf, but I\u2019m guessing you smell of another woman.\u201d</p><p>He bit her. No warning, no nothing. His teeth just sank into the curve where her neck flowed into her shoulder. She jumped, felt his hands lock onto her hips. Her spine was melting, her skin taut in expectation\u2014but if she gave in now, it was all over. Think, Sienna, think. Close to impossible when he was surrounding her, when he was taking her over. Damp heat bloomed between her legs, and his nostrils flared. Oh, God.</p><p>Acting more in self-defense than as a result of rational thought, she raised a fine line of X-fire where he gripped her.</p><p>He wrenched away with a snarl. \u201cYou burned me.\u201d The wolf. Very much the wolf.</p><p>Raising her hand to her shoulder, she touched the lingering heat of his bite. \u201cJust a warning.\u201d She\u2019d been careful not to burn, only to threaten. \u201cI don\u2019t like having your teeth in me.\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t hold back her gasp as he was suddenly in her face again, but found the will to say, \u201cDid you take out that ad?\u201d</p> <p>He traced the bite mark with his thumb. \u201cWhy are you half-naked?\u201d An almost careless question . . . except that his free hand was on her lower back again, and this time, he was using the rough pads of his fingers to stroke the strip of skin bared by her top. Slow and easy. And again.</p><p>She shivered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cold.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d thrown her into the SUV and come around to take his seat before she knew it. They were already halfway down the block by the time her heart stopped racing enough that she could speak. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go home.\u201d Part of her was terrified because she had no idea what to do with him in this kind of a mood, but retreat was not an option. Not when she was playing for keeps. \u201cHawke? Are you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>Picking up a bottle of water from the holder between the seats, he said, \u201cWash off his scent.\u201d</p><p>Her thighs clenched at the possessive demand in that tone, but she folded her arms. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>A low growl filled the SUV, tightening her nipples to painful points. Unsettled\u2014though not shocked\u2014by the visceral depth of her response, she was attempting to find some kind of solid ground when he wrenched the car to a stop on the side of the road and turned. \u201cThen I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Pale, pale eyes gone night-glow, a voice so calm as to make it patently clear the predator was well and truly off the leash.</p><p>Difficult as it was to withstand the impact of his dominance, she reminded herself his wasn\u2019t the only power in the vehicle. \u201cTouch me and I\u2019ll singe your eyebrows off.\u201d</p><p>A shrug. \u201cThey\u2019ll grow back.\u201d Tugging off the scarf she\u2019d used to tie up her hair, he dampened it in the water.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d She pushed back at him as he crowded her into the corner.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to play, baby.\u201d Soft words that had her freezing in place. \u201cSo we\u2019ll play.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth went dry as he ran the damp cloth over her lips with piercing focus. She knew she should protest his actions, but her voice seemed to have deserted her with him so close\u2014so big and gorgeous and furious that he took over every inch of space, every breath of air. \u201cThere,\u201d he murmured, running the cloth down her neck and over her shoulder before leaning down to press his lips to the bite mark.</p><p>Arousal twisted through her body, until she had to sink her teeth into her lower lip to still her moan. That wasn\u2019t an erogenous zone. She knew that. And yet she didn\u2019t dare move for fear he\u2019d stop the delicious torture. Another kiss, wet and hot. His hair brushing against her skin as he licked the mark, each strand a searing brand.</p><p>\u201cNext time that cub puts his hands on you,\u201d he said, raising his head after another lingering taste of her skin, \u201cI\u2019ll tear out his throat and feed it to him.\u201d The words were said in such a reasonable tone that it took her a minute to process their meaning.</p><p>Lurching up, she grabbed the front of his T-shirt. \u201cYou will not touch any of my friends.\u201d</p><p>Patient wolf eyes. Deadly wolf eyes.</p><p>\u201cHawke.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and licked the bite mark again.</p><p>Her entire body shuddered, her breasts protesting the stiff confines of the corset. \u201cNo touching Kit,\u201d she whispered, barely able to speak past the dark pressure of a desire so long denied, it threatened to devour her.</p><p>His hand closed around her throat. Not a threat. Just the most possessive way a predatory changeling male had of touching a woman outside of sex. \u201cDon\u2019t say his name.\u201d He brushed his thumb across her pulse.</p><p>Closing her hand over his wrist, she said, \u201cYou\u2019re being unreasonable.\u201d The instant the words left her mouth, she realized she wasn\u2019t going to get \u201chuman\u201d behavior from him tonight. Hawke\u2019s wolf had always been close to the surface, and right now, it was in charge. Or perhaps it was more accurate to say that both man and wolf had shrugged off any pretensions to civilized behavior.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t want to go home.\u201d It wasn\u2019t quite the truth\u2014she\u2019d be delighted to be alone with him. But if she was going to win him, and keep him, he had to understand that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to walk all over her. Because he damn well would if he thought he could.</p><p>His gaze went watchful, waiting.</p><p>\u201cI want to go dancing again.\u201d</p><p>A slow smile.</p><p>\u201cIn a club,\u201d she added, quite certain rational thought would become a distant memory if he took her into his arms when they were alone, if he put his mouth on her skin, his hands on her body. \u201cThere.\u201d Breasts flushing at the hot pulse of need in the most intimate part of her, she pointed to a random club. \u201cThat one looks popular.\u201d</p><p>The growl was so low and deep that she felt it with her body first, her skin shimmering in reaction, the stiff points of her nipples rubbing against the corset. Only the discipline she\u2019d learned in the Net kept her from giving in. \u201cStop trying to intimidate me.\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering, he returned his attention to the road and began driving. It didn\u2019t take her long to realize they were most definitely heading back to den territory. Recognizing she\u2019d lost that round, she forced herself to regroup, to remember that she wasn\u2019t dealing with the cool, calculating alpha of SnowDancer at this moment, but with the wildness that lived in his heart.</p><p>That didn\u2019t mean she was about to surrender. Even if she had no idea what she\u2019d do if he decided to stop stalking her and pounced. \u201cDo you like my top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLatest style,\u201d she assured him, ignoring the silky menace of his response. \u201cLaces up the side, so it\u2019s easier to take off.\u201d</p><p>His hands clenched on the steering wheel as he headed up into the mountains.</p><p>\u201cAnd the boots.\u201d She lifted one leg up to the dash, stroked her hand over her thigh. \u201cThey make me\u2014\u201d</p><p>The car shuddered to a halt near the perimeter of den territory. Hawke was turning to her when he went motionless in a way she recognized. Predatory. Listening. Snapping to alertness, she brought down her leg and swept out with her telepathic senses . . . to find more than a few Psy minds in the vicinity.</p><p>\u201cPsy,\u201d Hawke said under his breath at the same instant. \u201cStay in the car.\u201d He was gone before she could argue.</p><p>Tempting as it was to disobey him, her damn boots would make her a liability. So she gave him a different kind of backup. Keeping him on the periphery of her psychic senses, she expanded her telepathic reach once more. Unsurprisingly, the intruders were shielded. Hawke\u2019s mind was even more impenetrable, his natural shields a solid wall. She\u2019d never know if he was hurt or in trouble. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Frustrated, she slid back her door with utmost care.</p><p>The night air raised goose bumps over her body, but she brushed aside that minor concern and focused every one of her senses on listening. With all of her senses\u2014psychic and otherwise. The instant she heard even the slightest indication of a fight, she\u2019d blow out every Psy mind in the vicinity.</p><p>This was her home. Her man. No one was allowed to fuck with either of them.</p> <p>IT took Hawke\u2019s wolf a bare minute to realize that Sienna was too smart, too dangerous, not to have come up with a plan in case things went balls-up. Shit. Pulling out the sat phone from his pocket, he typed in a short, terse message.</p><p>Do not act unless I give the signal. A howl from the wolf could carry for miles in the right conditions. Don\u2019t give yourself away. If anyone on the Council learned that she was alive, they\u2019d come after her, no holds barred. Since Hawke had no intention of letting them take her, things would turn brutal fast.</p><p>Then don\u2019t get hurt.</p><p>The return message made him grin despite the tense circumstances. Slipping the phone back into his pocket, he made his way with wolf-stealth to the area where he\u2019d scented the intruders. His wolf was angry at the trespass, but its anger was a silent, focused thing, both parts of him conscious of the need to uncover the enemy\u2019s agenda. SnowDancer stood in danger of becoming arrogant after their recent successes at foiling the covert operations, but the fact was, the psychic race posed a powerful threat.</p><p>Shifting from shadow to shadow without a sound, he brought himself to within five feet of the intruders.</p> <p>\u201c. . . too many trees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s correct. We need a more\u2014\u201d The speaker paused for a few seconds. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to continue this later. I\u2019m needed at the base.\u201d</p><p>The third Psy put one of his hands on each of the other two men\u2019s shoulders and teleported them out. Hawke could\u2019ve taken down at least one, maybe two, before the teleport, but he let them go. The first order of business was to figure out their game plan, something that\u2019d be far easier to do if whoever was leading this wasn\u2019t tipped off to the fact that SnowDancer was aware of any planned assault.</p><p>Checking to confirm the area was secure, he was about to head back to the SUV when he paused. Sienna had been Ming\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, had spent most of her life studying military tactics and strategies utilized by the Council. While the protective side of him wanted to cocoon her in safety, he was also the alpha of SnowDancer\u2014cool, calculated, and willing to use any advantage to protect his pack.</p><p>Bringing out his phone, he called her. \u201cCan you get to me?\u201d he asked, stepping a small distance away from the actual site to avoid being seen or heard by any concealed technology\u2014it paid to be extra paranoid after what Henry Scott had almost pulled off last year.</p><p>\u201cYes. I can see you with my telepathic eye.\u201d</p> <p>He frowned but didn\u2019t say anything until she appeared out of the night, her skin silver in the moonlight where it was bared by that ridiculous strip of fabric she called a top. \u201cCan I be tracked that way by all Psy?\u201d he asked, figuring it\u2019d take a single, precise claw swipe to cut the ties that held the corset so snug to her body.</p><p>Sienna shook her head, hair once more tied up with that scarf. \u201cNot you, specifically. I meant I did a telepathic sweep and found a single changeling mind.\u201d</p><p>Satisfied, he pointed out the compromised area, told her what he\u2019d overheard. \u201cAnything strike you?\u201d</p><p>Scanning the lightly wooded section, Sienna rubbed her hands up and down her upper arms in an absent manner. \u201cNothing you haven\u2019t already considered, I\u2019m sure\u2014if they need a more open space, I\u2019m thinking staging post.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Walking over, he wrapped his arms around her from behind. \u201cYou\u2019re frozen.\u201d Not surprising. But his wolf wasn\u2019t irritated at her choice of clothing anymore, not now that he\u2019d claimed skin privileges. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, breathing in the wild spice of her scent, \u201cwe won\u2019t learn anything more here tonight.\u201d He\u2019d get the techs to come out tomorrow and do a sweep, check the area was clean.</p><p>Sienna was uncharacteristically subdued as they walked to the car and got in. Though the cold didn\u2019t bother him in the slightest, he turned on the heater to high as he pulled away. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in that head of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy race attacks your people again.\u201d Quiet words. \u201cIs that why you hate the Psy? Because they never stop?\u201d</p><p>Echoes of blood and pain, of watching people he loved fall under claws and teeth as packmates turned on one another. \u201cNo.\u201d The scars left by the violence over two decades ago would never disappear, but he\u2019d learned to move past the feral anger that had driven him those first few years. \u201cI don\u2019t hate all Psy. Just those who follow the Council.\u201d</p> <p>Sienna squeezed her arms tight around herself, though the car was plenty warm now. This was the one thing, the one thing she\u2019d never factored into the equation. Yes, the attraction between them was the rawest of cravings, strong enough that it had finally brought Hawke to her. But, how could she possibly expect him to feel anything deeper for her, for a woman born of a race that had caused him so much pain that his voice went wolf when he spoke of it even now, his expression grim with old shadows.</p><p>The den had become home, the SnowDancers her friends and family, but she remembered how it had been when they\u2019d first arrived. Coping with the dual shock of being severed from the Net and of her inexplicable, violent reaction to the alpha with ice-cold eyes, Sienna had focused on simple survival those first few months. Still, she\u2019d trained under a Councilor, was the niece of an Arrow. She\u2019d filed away the whispers, the overheard snippets of conversation. All to do with the pack\u2019s stunned amazement that Hawke, \u201cof all people,\u201d would give a Psy family sanctuary \u201cafter what they\u2019d done to his own.\u201d</p><p>Her throat was suddenly lined with razors.</p><p>\u201cWere the Psy,\u201d she said, forcing herself to ask the hardest question, \u201cresponsible for the deaths of your parents?\u201d She knew he\u2019d lost them as a child, but no one ever spoke of the circumstances of that loss.</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t react for almost a minute. When he did, it was only to say, \u201cThere are some things you don\u2019t need to know.\u201d A slapdown. Cool. Unvarnished. Absolute.</p><p>It was in her nature to rebel against him, deepest instinct telling her that he would only ever respect a woman with the strength to stand up to him, but she had no right to ask him to return to a nightmare. \u201cI apologize.\u201d Turning her attention to the passing darkness of the forest, her trembling fingers hidden in her fists, she stared unseeing into the night.</p><p>RECOVERED FROM COMPUTER 2(A) TAGS: PERSONAL CORRESPONDENCE, FATHER, ACTION NOT REQUIRED</p><p>FROM: Alice &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>TO: Dad &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>DATE: February 12th, 1972 at 10:00pm</p><p>SUBJECT: Published at Last!!</p><p>Dear Dad,</p><p>I\u2019ve just received the first copies of my book. I know you didn\u2019t care for the nonscholarly title but I do think The Mysterious E Designation: Empathic Gifts &amp; Shadows sounds snazzy.</p><p>To answer the question in your last e-mail\u2014yes, I am still single, but I have time yet before you\u2019re consigned to retirement without grandchildren (especially since you plan to never retire). Tell Mom I went over to the house and the flowers are blooming beautifully\u2014one of my empathic friends has been helping me with the gardens. E-Psy have such green fingers. Maybe I should study that next time.</p><p>As for the X Project, it\u2019s been almost a year since I began and I\u2019ve realized I can\u2019t rely solely on my tiny live sample. I\u2019ve asked for and received archival assistance from a Psy librarian who will mine the PsyNet for data about past Xs, while I do the same in the libraries I can access.</p><p>My premise is that this mutation would not exist unless it had a purpose, but George pointed out how many rare diseases are caused by mutations. If I were to follow that line of thought, I\u2019d have to conclude that the Xs are so uncommon because they have no function and that their deaths are an attempt by nature to control a dangerous disease. That\u2019s not a thought I\u2019m comfortable having, but as a scientist, I know it\u2019s as viable a theory as any.</p><p>I so wish you were home so we could have these discussions in person.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Alice</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>LARA SAT AT her desk in the infirmary, having stayed late to keep an eye on an elderly wolf who\u2019d had a fall, but her mind wasn\u2019t on the papers in front of her. She\u2019d enjoyed tormenting Walker about her date with Kieran, but her amusement had faded the instant he\u2019d left, to be replaced by a throbbing ache that mocked her attempt at getting over him.</p><p>The fact was, the attraction she felt toward Walker Lauren was no simple thing\u2014it had been growing slowly ever since he entered the den, layer by layer, word by word. The more she learned about the man behind the reserved mask, the harder she fell. His rebuff had bruised those emotions, bruised them badly, but she\u2019d been stupid to think they\u2019d disappear just because she wanted them gone.</p><p>It didn\u2019t surprise her how tempting it was to cling to the apparent jealousy that had driven him to seek her out. But even if she had read him right, she was certain the emotion wouldn\u2019t make him change his mind\u2014Walker wasn\u2019t the kind of man who vacillated, and he\u2019d been damn unequivocal that their single kiss had been a mistake.</p><p>However Lara, too, wasn\u2019t a woman who made decisions lightly, and she\u2019d made one to move on. And as her friend Ava had pointed out in her frank, no-nonsense way earlier today, Kieran might not have been a good fit for her, but he was the first man she\u2019d gone out with in the past six months.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t,\u201d Ava had continued, \u201cgiven any other man a chance to impact your feelings toward Walker.\u201d</p><p>With that truth in mind, she called up a senior tech who\u2019d asked her out three months ago, and set up a lunch date for the following day. Feeling good about his instant agreement, she was just hanging up when she saw Walker in the doorway. Once, she\u2019d have assumed he\u2019d come to see her. Tonight, her immediate thought was that someone was hurt. \u201cWho?\u201d she asked, rising to her feet. \u201cWhat do\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He halted her with a hand on her wrist, his skin rough against her own, his grip unbreakable. Startled, she froze. Her shock was the only thing that muted her instinctive response to his touch. Because she loved Walker\u2019s hands, loved the calluses that came from what he did in his spare time, the beautiful things he created\u2014including tiny pieces of furniture for his daughter\u2019s cherished dollhouse.</p><p>Now, that strong, warm hand held her in place as he leaned forward to put a tray of food on her desk, the dark water and snow-dusted fir of his scent enclosing her in a sensual prison that allowed no escape. \u201cYou missed dinner. Again.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf\u2019s entire body quivered at what from a male wolf would signal the start of a serious courtship, but Lara squelched that reaction. She wasn\u2019t about to set herself up for more hurt. \u201cI was busy.\u201d In spite of her calm words, when he nudged her back into her chair, she went without argument.</p> <p>However, when he leaned that tall, strong body back against her desk\u2014so close that she could\u2019ve stroked her hand over his jean-clad thigh, the worn denim stretched taut over firm muscle\u2014picked up the plate, and went to feed her a forkful, she jerked herself free of the lingering tendrils of shock. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, taking the plate. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Sliding her chair a little farther from him, she forced herself to answer. \u201cIt\u2019s an intimacy . . . like skin privileges.\u201d</p><p>Walker didn\u2019t ask any further questions, but neither did he leave\u2014as Lara\u2019s body language indicated he should. He knew he was pushing uninvited into her space, but he also knew he didn\u2019t like it when she didn\u2019t take care of herself and he\u2019d had enough of watching that happen. And though it might\u2019ve been smarter to keep his distance, given her disconcerting effect on him . . . he\u2019d missed her.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear,\u201d he asked, because Lara was the one person with whom he\u2019d always found words, \u201cthat Marlee joined the children\u2019s choir?\u201d It was the first time he\u2019d made a deliberate effort to initiate\u2014rebuild\u2014any kind of a bond with a woman.</p> <p>A genuine smile broke through the shadows on Lara\u2019s face. \u201cI heard Ben and her practicing. She\u2019s got a beautiful voice.\u201d</p><p>So, Walker thought, did Lara.</p><p>SIENNA jerked upright in bed, her plain black tank top stuck to her skin. The nightmare hadn\u2019t raised its ugly head for months, but it had made up for lost time tonight. Shoving off the blankets, she swung her legs over the side of the bed and pushed back strands of hair that had escaped her braid to stick to sweat-damp skin.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d Ming, looking at her as a human might a high-performance vehicle. \u201cYou really are the most perfect genetic specimen.\u201d</p><p>Perfect\u2014if you wanted a cold-blooded mass murderer. Except of course, her blood no longer ran cold. \u201cStill a potential murderer,\u201d she whispered, trembling so hard her vision wavered.</p><p>\u201cWe are who we make ourselves.\u201d Judd\u2019s voice, compelling in its very quietness. \u201cDon\u2019t ever give up your will to some idea of genetic predestination.\u201d</p> <p>She clung to his words. Judd had made it. He\u2019d changed the nature of his gift from death to life, become a healer. That wasn\u2019t a path Sienna could follow, her ability was too much of violence, but she\u2019d forge her own path\u2014and not as the butcher Ming had intended her to be, the butcher he\u2019d spent so many years grooming in the expectation of owning her body and soul. Until she\u2019d proven too dangerous even for him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t break me, you bastard.\u201d Not then, and not now.</p><p>Rising to her feet, she stripped and walked into the shower, setting the temperature close to boiling point. Only when her skin was pulsing with heat almost painful in its intensity did she step out and rub herself down. A glance at the clock showed her it was five a.m. Dressing and plaiting her damp hair, she logged in to the roster to double-check her schedule and saw a reminder that she was meant to attend a training session from noon until late in the afternoon.</p><p>Checking the rest of the roster, she coded in a call to Riordan. It went through with visuals. A rumpled sounding wolf said, \u201cI\u2019m getting up, Mom. I promise,\u201d from under a blanket. \u201cGimme just a minute.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched. \u201cYou mind if I take your shift this morning?\u201d He was rostered on from six to eleven.</p><p>Riordan raised his head to meet her gaze, his hair sticking up in a mess that was mysteriously attractive. \u201cDear God, you\u2019re showered. Crazy woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I am . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t ask if I wasn\u2019t.\u201d If she kept moving, then maybe she\u2019d forget the bleak insight she\u2019d had in the SUV last night, forget that the past stood as an opaque barrier between her and the only man who\u2019d ever broken through her own shields. \u201cYou can pay me back later in the week.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds good. Thanks, Sin.\u201d</p><p>Logging off, she grabbed a small daypack and walked out to the communal kitchen/dining area in this sector of the den. It was empty, the lighting dim. But someone had started the coffee, and there was a still-warm tray of muffins on the counter. The sight made her heart lift.</p><p>Forcing herself to wait, she stashed a water bottle in her pack, along with a sandwich she put together using the fresh ingredients in the cooler. That done, she poured herself a glass of milk\u2014a habit for which both Evie and Riordan teased her unmercifully\u2014chose the biggest muffin on the tray and sat down to indulge. Her eyes almost rolled back into her head at the first bite.</p><p>Cream cheese and peaches\u2014her favorite.</p><p>Licking her fingers after finishing it, she glanced at the tray, bit her lower lip. Food was the most innocent of sensual pleasures but one she never took for granted, remembering all too well the nutrition bars that had been the mainstay of her diet for so many years. It was Hawke, she remembered with a stab of pain deep within, who had given her her first bite of something that had set her senses humming.</p><p>She\u2019d been shaky, on her knees on the grass, her arms around the kids as they\u2019d blacked out after Walker cut their connection to the PsyNet.Judd had stood in front, Walker at the back, both of them giving her time to make certain Toby and Marlee wouldn\u2019t break away from the newly created familial net into which Sienna had pulled them, wouldn\u2019t seek to rejoin the Net.</p><p>So blue, she remembered thinking as she raised her head and met the gaze of the man who stood opposite Judd\u2019s protective form, his hair brilliant even in the dull sunlight that fateful morning. So lethal, had been her next thought. They\u2019d done their research, and so she\u2019d known who he was, what he might yet do to the adults, herself included.</p><p>But Toby and Marlee, they were children, and wolves loved children. Judd, Walker, and Sienna had bet the kids\u2019 lives on that bit of knowledge, hoping against hope that the two youngest members of the family would find some way to gain the necessary biofeedback from the wolf pack once the adults were gone. Because though\u2014once he\u2019d realized they\u2019d fetch no ransom\u2014the wolf alpha had ordered them to cut their PsyNet links if they were to have any chance of gaining sanctuary, none of the adults expected to live through the day.</p><p>It was only later, with the children secured in the LaurenNet, that Sienna realized the wolf alpha was biting out clipped orders to his men and women. Blankets had already appeared for the children in the time she\u2019d spent on the psychic plane. Sienna stood with Marlee in her arms, while Walker took Toby, and Judd stayed as their shield. Her body swayed.</p><p>The wolf alpha\u2019s eyes snapped to her. \u201cGive her to me.\u201d</p><p>She should\u2019ve let Judd answer, but she was a cardinal who\u2019d effectively been on her own since she was five\u2014she knew a challenge when she heard it. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>A single raised eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019ve defected, sweetheart. No use worrying about the big, bad wolf now.\u201d</p><p>She was aware of Judd speaking, but her attention never shifted off the man who was a predator, for all that he wore a human skin. When he peeled open and held out a bar of some kind, she took it, aware low energy levels could be dangerous when it came to her ability to keep a handle on the cold fire. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>A faint smile, a strange amusement in those icy eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>It was the most polite interaction they\u2019d ever had.</p><p>HAWKE spent the morning in a business negotiation\u2014the other party was attempting to get SnowDancer to increase its offer by dangling a bullshit competing bid in front of them, an underhanded tactic, but one Hawke understood. What he had a problem with was the fact the Psy conglomerate thought SnowDancer too stupid to know the difference between a fair if tough price and a scalping.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d the Psy negotiator said from the comm screen, her face pristine in its lack of expression. \u201cI\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t accept anything less than a fifteen percent increase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d Hawke said, having had enough, \u201cI guess this negotiation is over.\u201d Ending the call before she could respond, he glanced over at Jem, who\u2019d sat in on the session from L.A. \u201cFind us another supplier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have a short list by tonight.\u201d The lieutenant\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cThey really think we got to where we are by being dumb shits? You\u2019d think they\u2019d know better by now.\u201d</p><p>Hawke shrugged, ignoring the flashing message that said the negotiator was trying to reinitiate contact. \u201cThey will, when their shares take a nosedive.\u201d SnowDancer was the largest pack in the country and had the attendant economic power. While Hawke had a preference for dealing with changeling or human companies\u2014for the simple reason that the Councilors had interests in, and control over, so many Psy businesses\u2014Psy were the only option in certain sectors. Except\u2014\u201cThat small human start-up, what was it called . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAquarius?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s the one. Can they supply us?\u201d</p><p>Jem took a moment to check her files. \u201cThey have the intellectual know how, but it\u2019ll stretch their capacity.\u201d A pause. \u201cOf course, with a contract this big, they\u2019ll be able to afford to expand.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want to talk to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll set up a face-to-face today.\u201d</p><p>Leaving Jem to handle that, Hawke headed out for a hunt in wolf form with some of his senior soldiers. It was something he did on a regular basis, having no desire to be an alpha who didn\u2019t know the wants and needs of his people. More, it was a need within his wolf, to run side by side with those who were his own.</p> <p>As a result of the hunt, and the ensuing conversation, he didn\u2019t get back to the den until after four. At which point, he showered, dressed in clean clothes, and took one of the SUVs for a drive down to the city.</p><p>TIRED from the physical day and devastatingly conscious that Hawke hadn\u2019t sought her out since walking her to her quarters the night before . . . when he\u2019d been reminded once again of what the Psy had taken from him, Sienna sat cross-legged in bed, planning to work on a physics problem. It would keep her mind busy until exhaustion kicked her into dreamless sleep. That was the hope, anyway.</p><p>She\u2019d picked up the datapad and was about to bring up the file when there was a knock on her door. Expecting it to be Evie or one of her other friends, she put aside the device and jumped up to open it without bothering about the fact that she was wearing her favorite soft black pajama pants and a faded gray T-shirt.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t Evie at the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d It came out husky, near soundless.</p> <p>Ice blue eyes traced the contours of her face. \u201cI had unfinished business.\u201d He brought out a small wrapped box from behind his back. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>She took the box without a conscious decision to act, stared.</p><p>Hawke leaned his arm against the doorjamb. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to open it?\u201d</p><p>It was hard to think with him so close, his voice a deep murmur that turned her doorway into a private alcove, the moment into a slow, potent seduction. \u201cWhat\u2019s inside?\u201d Her fingers closed around the box, possessive as any predatory changeling.</p><p>\u201cIf I told you, what would be the surprise?\u201d The heat of him caressed her as he took over her world. She couldn\u2019t see around him, his shoulders too wide, his presence too compelling. \u201cI am, however\u201d\u2014his voice dropping, that wolf-blue gaze focused on her mouth\u2014\u201cwilling to trade kisses for the secret.\u201d</p><p>The languid comment had her toes curling. Determined not to let him disconcert her any further, she undid the gauzy white ribbon with care and put it on top of the little shelf that stood against the wall beside the door, before beginning to unwrap the silver paper.</p> <p>Hawke chuckled. \u201cSo neat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the way we were taught in the Net.\u201d Such habits were more necessary for her than most, a reminder to ensure mental discipline. But that was the last thing on her mind at that instant, because she\u2019d finished unwrapping her gift.</p><p>Lifting off the top part of the metallic cardboard box, she set it beside the paper and picked out the item wrapped in several layers of tissue. Hawke took the other half of the box and put it on the shelf as she pulled away the tissue to reveal\u2014\u201cOh.\u201d Wonder unfurled within her at the sight of the tiny penguin formed of shining metal, complete with black tuxedo and gold saxophone.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Reaching out as she stood the painstakingly-crafted object on her palm, Hawke turned the key at the back.</p><p>The penguin began to \u201cplay\u201d the sax with its fin, dipping and raising its head in time to the tinny saxophone music that appeared to emanate from the instrument at its mouth. The song was hauntingly familiar. Frowning, she turned the key when it wound down, listened again . . . and lost any hope of holding out against the wolf at her door even if she\u2019d wanted to. \u201cWe danced to this.\u201d Under the moonlight, deep in the forest.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d forgotten,\u201d Hawke said, his head close to hers, though she couldn\u2019t remember seeing him move, \u201cI\u2019d have had to bite you again.\u201d</p><p>Her hand went to her shoulder. \u201cThe mark\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>Reaching out, he tugged at her T-shirt to bare the vulnerable skin, rubbed his thumb over the spot. Wolf-blue gleamed between slitted lids. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p> <p>The shiver that rocked through her at that low demand almost unseated the whimsical toy on her palm. Shaking her head at the wolf who very definitely wanted to use his teeth on her, she said, \u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a little shop in the city\u2014I\u2019ll take you there someday.\u201d His hand slid to the back of her nape. \u201cI asked the owner to use that song.\u201d</p><p>It was tempting, so tempting, to lean her head against that wide chest, to stay in this perfect moment and ignore the words spoken in the car last night, but she\u2019d never been a woman to hide from the facts\u2014once, it had been because she\u2019d had no choice, but now it had become part of her very character.</p><p>Raising her head, she looked into that wild gaze, that of a human with the heart of a wolf. \u201cWhy are you giving this to me?\u201d It was a silent apology, she understood that\u2014but the reason behind his harsh words last night couldn\u2019t remain unsaid. They were a dark shadow over any future relationship.</p><p>It was the wolf who answered her. \u201cI just am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any others?\u201d she asked, changing tack.</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>It was the most peculiar feeling, having this conversation with Hawke, neither of them trying to draw blood. \u201cMay I see them?\u201d</p><p>A shrug. \u201cIf you\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>Her skin was suddenly too tight over her breasts, even the softness of the T-shirt too abrasive. \u201cHow many do you have?\u201d she asked as he stepped impossibly closer, until the muscled strength of his thighs bracketed her own.</p><p>\u201cAll these questions.\u201d His hand tightening on her nape, his body hard and demanding against the sensitive tips of her breasts. \u201cMaybe I want something in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d she began, not knowing if she was going to surrender or push for the answers she needed when Hawke\u2019s phone beeped.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d he murmured without breaking the searing eye contact, without removing the rough heat of his hand from her nape. \u201cThat\u2019s Riley\u2019s code.\u201d He placed the phone to his ear.</p><p>And everything changed.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>\u201cKEEP THEM CONTAINED. I\u2019ll find Judd and head down.\u201d Hawke saw Sienna\u2019s eyes sharpen, realized she\u2019d put the pieces together. \u201cNo. No communication. If they talk in spite of the order, shoot the men in the legs.\u201d</p><p>The woman across from him didn\u2019t appear the least shocked by his instructions. \u201cMore intruders,\u201d she said when he ended the call.</p><p>Rubbing his thumb over her lips in lieu of the slow, deep kiss he\u2019d intended to coax from her, he dropped his hand and said, \u201cCan you telepath Judd, get him to meet me at the garage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m doing it now.\u201d</p><p>Hawke had turned and was on his way before he stopped to think that maybe he should\u2019ve said some sweet words instead of making such an abrupt departure, especially after last night. Even the most mature of women tended to get miffed about things like that. Pulling out his phone as he ran to the garage, he coded in a call.</p><p>Sienna picked up at once. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d No anger, only an incisive intelligence.</p><p>That was when he remembered that this woman had been raised in a military context, understood about the need for a rapid response. \u201cHow far away is Judd?\u201d he asked instead of the pretty words he\u2019d much rather save to whisper in her ear when she was naked and well pleasured under him. Very well pleasured.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there.\u201d A pause. \u201cBe careful.\u201d It held the distinct edge of a command.</p><p>Surprised but not opposed to the idea of that particular command from this specific woman, his wolf pricked up its ears. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201d Hanging up, he entered the garage just as Judd appeared from the opposite corridor.</p><p>JUDD stopped in the heavy dark of the trees surrounding the clearing where the SnowDancer unit held four men and a pregnant woman at gunpoint. \u201cConfirmed, Psy,\u201d he said in a subvocal murmur to the man who stood beside him. It had taken him time to learn to speak that low, so low that he couldn\u2019t hear his own voice\u2014but that changelings could discern with unerring accuracy.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d Hawke asked, his attention focused on the intruders.</p><p>\u201cNo symbols on their shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s on purpose\u2014those are military uniforms, should have emblems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not touching her abdomen.\u201d A pregnant woman who cared about her unborn child would have made some protective move that betrayed the disintegration of her conditioning\u2014rather than standing with military stiffness. Still . . . \u201cI can\u2019t say with certainty that her state is meant to manipulate your emotions. Her Silence could simply be too strong.\u201d He melted farther back into the dark as Hawke stepped out to stand beside Riley.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen\u2014and woman,\u201d the wolf alpha said with deceptive calm. \u201cWould you care to explain the reason for this territorial breach?\u201d</p><p>The man who replied was tall, with features that placed his ancestry as originating in the Indian subcontinent, most probably on the border with China. \u201cWe have defected.\u201d A frigid statement, but that meant nothing. Judd had sounded as cold once upon a time. \u201cWe seek sanctuary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you think SnowDancer would offer sanctuary to a bunch of Psy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are rumors you have done so on at least one previous occasion.\u201d Judd\u2019s blood chilled in his veins. His entire family had disappeared off the grid, was meant to be listed as dead in the Net. \u201cHe\u2019s fishing,\u201d he said into the microphone clipped to the collar of his leather-synth jacket, though he knew Hawke was well aware of that fact.</p><p>Now, the SnowDancer alpha curved his lips into a grin that was all teeth. \u201cWe may have run across the occasional stray,\u201d he said, reaching down to pet one of the wild wolves that had streamed out of the forest in response to his presence.</p><p>\u201cThen you indeed offered them sanctuary?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hawke stroked the wolf at his side, a beautiful creature of deepest black . . . the same shade as the much larger changeling wolf who prowled out to join the circle of watchers. Riaz. The SnowDancer lieutenant stared unblinking at the trespassers with eyes a startling shade akin to ancient gold.</p><p>\u201cDepends what you define as sanctuary.\u201d Hawke\u2019s tone was easy, as if this was an everyday conversation. \u201cI\u2019m sure they no longer feel any pain . . . no longer feel anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying they\u2019re dead?\u201d</p> <p>A faint smile. \u201cNow, if I said that, I\u2019d be admitting to murder.\u201d He angled his head toward the woman, and Judd knew the wolf was assessing the truth of her. \u201cOur legal team would frown on that.\u201d Then he did something Judd would have never expected.</p><p>Throwing back his head, he howled\u2014the sound eerily beautiful, seeming to come from a wolf\u2019s throat, not a human\u2019s. The wolves around him, wild and changeling, reacted in a split second, forelegs bunching as they launched themselves at the intruders. Only someone who\u2019d been watching with utmost care would\u2019ve seen that their lunge would have them streaming around the woman.</p><p>The Psy weren\u2019t paying that kind of close attention. But the woman didn\u2019t clamp her hand around her belly, didn\u2019t try to shield her womb, didn\u2019t attempt to protect her body in any way. Instead, she, like the others, slammed out a hand in a telekinetic thrust that shoved the wolves back . . . and teleported out.</p><p>At a speed that meant each had done their own personal teleport.</p><p>Judd hissed out a breath. There was no chance of four teleport-capable Tk-Psy\u2014all of whom would\u2019ve been pulled into the Council superstructure as youths\u2014deciding to defect at the same time. No chance. It would provoke too much attention, incite too massive a search. No Council operative would make that mistake\u2014and all four of the intruders had been standing in a battle-ready stance that revealed their training.</p> <p>\u201cClear!\u201d one of the SnowDancers called out, holding up a gadget Brenna and the other techs had put together to detect any surveillance devices in their territory.</p><p>Only then did Judd step out of concealment. \u201cSomebody suspects we\u2019re still alive.\u201d</p><p>Hawke, having crouched down to stroke, touch, and play with the wild wolves that swarmed over him, now rose. \u201cOur demonstration should put that rumor to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially when it happens to be so close to the truth.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s grin was that of the wolf, amused and dangerous. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I was feeling mellow the day the five of you turned up in our territory.\u201d</p><p>Judd knew now that Marlee and Toby had never been in any danger\u2014the wolves balked at harming any child, even one who might be a threat. It was their Achilles\u2019 heel, one the Council could not be allowed to discover, because they were fully capable of breeding and sending in child operatives. \u201cLet me talk to my contacts, see if I can get an idea of who might\u2019ve been behind the fishing expedition.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA Councilor has a hand in it somewhere with all those Tks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a second option.\u201d</p><p>When Hawke turned to him in question, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize them, but it\u2019s possible they were recruited into the squad after I left.\u201d Arrows didn\u2019t turn against their own, but Judd had defected and, in so doing, broken the covenant. \u201cThey might be hunting me.\u201d Feeling a wolf brush against him as he finished speaking, he glanced down at Riaz, who\u2019d wandered over from the other side of the clearing. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>But the lieutenant was only interested in Hawke, walking over to sniff at the alpha. Judd was certain he saw the black wolf grin before Hawke warned him off with a low growl. Judd didn\u2019t have changeling senses but he had a brain. Still, he made no comment. Not yet.</p><p>IT was late when Hawke returned to the den. He should\u2019ve gone to bed, but instead he tracked a certain scent through the corridors until he located Sienna in the same training room where he\u2019d watched her once before. This, the thing between him and Sienna, he didn\u2019t know where it was going, and yeah, his guilt at claiming her when he had so little to offer continued to be a claw raking his gut\u2014but as proven by his inability to keep his distance, ignoring it was no longer an option.</p><p>As for the guilt? Turned out it stood no chance against the piercing pleasure he derived from being in her presence. Locking the door behind himself now, he sat down on a bench to savor the sight of her moving with such lithe grace. \u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep?\u201d he asked when she saw him and halted.</p><p>She pushed a flyaway tendril out of her eyes. \u201cI was worried.\u201d A statement without sophistication, stark in its honesty. \u201cI wanted to telepath Judd, but I knew he wouldn\u2019t tell me anything without authorization.\u201d</p><p>Protecting his own was instinct, but this was her life\u2014a life she\u2019d fought for from the start. He wasn\u2019t about to handicap her by leaving her blind to a possible threat.</p> <p>She sucked in a breath as he started giving her the rundown, her face going pale under those intriguing freckles she\u2019d gained during the summer months. \u201cMe,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve given us away.\u201d</p><p>He was already rising to cup her jaw, run his finger over the softness of her skin. \u201cNo one would have recognized you,\u201d he said, thinking she was worried about her visits to Wild, the city. \u201cHell, I hardly recognized you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A violent shake of her head, her eyes gone midnight. \u201cWhen I \u2018earth\u2019 the X-fire, it causes a psychic shockwave. They\u2019d have to be close to feel it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he said, seeing the lethal point she was trying to make, \u201cHenry Scott\u2019s men have been lurking on the fringes and maybe even in interior sections of den territory for months.\u201d</p><p>She gave a jagged nod. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should\u2019ve realized\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stopped her with a finger on her lips. \u201cEven if they did catch something, it must\u2019ve only been the barest hint, or they\u2019d have been a lot more certain tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll come back.\u201d She spoke against his touch, and it was instinct to trace those full lips, to indulge himself that much though he knew he couldn\u2019t allow himself to go any further. Not tonight. Not when she was so shocked and vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cThen,\u201d he said, drawing in her scent, \u201cwe\u2019ll take care of them.\u201d He rubbed the rough pad of his thumb over her lower lip, deeply satisfied to hear her breath catch. \u201cCan you mute the release of your power in any way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hot breath against his skin, the thudding beat of her pulse a caress that had his body going rigid in want. \u201cI\u2019ll go deep into SnowDancer territory, places I know are under heavy guard and highly unlikely to be compromised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d It was beyond tempting to bite the flushed curves of her mouth, but he resisted and said, \u201cWhat were you reading when I came in earlier? I saw the reader on the bed.\u201d</p><p>Sienna had been sick to her stomach when she\u2019d realized her actions might\u2019ve brought danger to her whole family, but now, a wholly different sensation skittered within her abdomen. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we,\u201d she said against that thumb that continued to tease her until it felt as if her lips were connected in a direct line to the damp heat between her legs, \u201cdiscuss the security issue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing more to discuss yet.\u201d Wolf eyes looking out of a human face, his body so close her own brushed against the implacable strength of him with every breath.</p><p>When he moved that tormenting touch away from her lips to close his hand over the sensitive column of her throat, she shuddered. \u201cA physics text.\u201d Part of her said she was letting him have too much control of the situation, but the rest of her waited in strained anticipation to see what he would do next.</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Reaching back, he undid her braid, sliding the dark mass over one shoulder so it tumbled over her breast. \u201cYou\u2019re getting straight A\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>Surprise cut through the desire so heavy in her limbs, in her blood. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>A slow smile. \u201cBecause I know your brain never stops working.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how to take that. \u201cAre you making fun of me?\u201d</p><p>Sliding both hands down to her waist, he said, \u201cNo,\u201d and stroked his hands up, back down again. \u201cI like how smart you are.\u201d</p><p>It was an unexpected compliment, one that meant far more to her than the most flowery of words. \u201cI like your mind, too,\u201d she whispered as her arms rose of their own volition to wrap around his neck. He was too tall for that, so she curved her hand around the side of his neck, the shift of muscle and tendon a stark intimacy under her palm. \u201cYour thought processes fascinate me.\u201d He could be so icily rational, and yet the wolf was always there, primal and untamed.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re equal.\u201d Cupping her nape with one hand, he moved the other to her lower back. And somehow, they were dancing, though the only music was the thudding pulse of her heart, the rough caress of his breath.</p><p>JUDD managed to get in touch with the Ghost around three that morning, the other man agreeing to meet him an hour later in the murky confines of an abandoned building project. Black plastic fluttered in the night winds, the solid skeleton of the house providing an illusion of permanence. \u201cYou\u2019ve been hard to track down of late,\u201d Judd said to the rebel who was so close to the Net, Judd worried its madness was starting to seep into the Ghost\u2019s brain.</p><p>Face hidden in the gloom, the Ghost leaned back against one of the supporting beams. \u201cYou asked me once what my reason was for doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis\u201d being their combined efforts to topple the Council . . . though no longer Silence. The question had become more complex than that. As evidenced by the second level of dissonance in Sienna\u2019s brain, some Psy needed Silence, or some aspect of it, on a basic level. \u201cAre you ready to share?\u201d</p><p>The only thing the Ghost had admitted to date was that there was at least one individual in the Net who had some value to him, one person he did not want dead. That was the solitary thing that kept him from annihilating the entire Council, an act that would cause a psychic shockwave and destabilize the Net, killing millions. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d the rebel said in response to his question. \u201cBut I have one, that much you should know.\u201d</p><p>Judd understood without further explanation that that unnamed reason lay behind the Ghost\u2019s recent lack of availability. \u201cI need to know if my cover is blown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Your entire family is presumed dead.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny rumors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is a myth of a cardinal X, but you and I both know that to be impossible.\u201d</p><p>Judd wondered just how much the Ghost knew and how far the rebel\u2019s allegiance went. But he also knew that while Sienna had gained control of her ability with the sheer, stubborn refusal to surrender, there would come a time when the X-marker would demand more from her than she could give. He had to take a chance on the Ghost\u2019s loyalty, to roll the dice. Because if he didn\u2019t and Sienna\u2019s power did spiral out of control . . . \u201cHave you heard of Alice Eldridge\u2019s second manuscript?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dissertation on designation X?\u201d The Ghost straightened. \u201cYes. It\u2019s one of the most hidden, yet persistent rumors in the Net.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny indication the rumor might hold a grain of truth?\u201d</p> <p>A long, quiet pause. \u201cI\u2019ll do a search.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll owe you one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Judd. Don\u2019t ever say that to me\u2014I may very well collect.\u201d There was a chill darkness to that statement, as if Judd would not like the payment demanded.</p><p>\u201cThen I withdraw it.\u201d Hair blowing back in a sudden gust that sent the black plastic flapping, he glanced at the man of whose identity he was ninety-nine point nine percent certain. \u201cHave you ever considered taking the rebellion into the open?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would never succeed. First the foundations must be set. Only then can the wave crest.\u201d</p><p>Judd thought of everything they\u2019d done together, everything they\u2019d accomplished, considered the cost. \u201cHow is your mental status?\u201d It was a question he\u2019d never asked with such bluntness, but times had changed.</p> <p>\u201cSane.\u201d A short answer. \u201cThough sanity is a question of interpretation.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>ALTERNATING BETWEEN CONTENTMENT and frustration at the remembered feel of Sienna in his arms, Hawke was drinking his first cup of coffee the next morning when he got a call from Kenji, the SnowDancer lieutenant based near the San Gabriel Mountains. With his high cheekbones, startling green eyes, and violent magenta hair, he looked like an escapee from a desert rave\u2014or maybe some avant garde catwalk show.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck did you do to your hair?\u201d Hawke asked, almost choking on his coffee. Because while he might be channeling a Japanese rock star, the fact was, Kenji was about as avant garde as your average elementary school teacher.</p><p>\u201cIt annoys Garnet. Reason enough.\u201d He tapped a rolled-up chart on the comm screen. \u201cI\u2019ve had an interesting contact from the BlackSea Coalition.\u201d</p><p>Hawke put down his coffee. BlackSea was a changeling pack\u2014in a sense. It was a coalition of all the water-based changelings. As single entities, their population numbers were miniscule, with only one or two recorded instances of some changeling types. However, rather than being powerless, they\u2019d grouped together to form a close-knit network that gave them considerable negotiating and territorial power.</p><p>\u201cBusiness?\u201d</p><p>Kenji shook his head. \u201cThey want in on an alliance.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSend me the data.\u201d It would go to the top of his list, because unlike any other pack on the face of the planet, BlackSea had members worldwide. \u201cCopy Riley on everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d Kenji signed off.</p><p>Seeing a scrawled message on his desk, Hawke headed out to speak to Indigo about some of the younger pack members she\u2019d had under supervision.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re more balanced,\u201d she said after they\u2019d finished the discussion, long legs crossed on top of her desk while he stood with his back against the closed door of her office.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d The contact he\u2019d allowed himself with Sienna had satisfied both parts of him to the extent that his need was no longer bleeding out to everyone around him. More to the point, the wolf was willing to be patient now that he\u2019d decided to go after her\u2014it understood the hunt, understood that sometimes you had to stalk your prey. \u201cI hear Tai\u2019s dating Evie,\u201d he said in an effort to distract Indigo because he wasn\u2019t ready to discuss his decision.</p><p>Indigo\u2019s expression said she was onto him, but she let it slide. \u201cI\u2019ve promised to break both his arms if he makes her unhappy in any way, shape, or form.\u201d A pause. \u201cI should promise to do the same to you.\u201d</p><p>Hawke narrowed his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll go there\u2014that\u2019s why I\u2019m a lieutenant.\u201d Swinging her legs off her desk, she picked up a small datapad. \u201cBut not today. I\u2019m late for a session with the novices.\u201d Rising, she waited for him to open the door. \u201cOn second thought . . .\u201d She pushed her free hand into his hair and pulled down his head.</p><p>\u201cI almost let the best thing that ever happened to me slip away because I was hung up on ideas of what I \u2018should\u2019 want. Sometimes there is no \u2018should,\u2019 there\u2019s only a single chance to grab on to happiness.\u201d Pressing her lips to his in a fast, affectionate kiss, she let go and strode off.</p><p>Her parting statement, however, didn\u2019t disappear as easily.</p><p>SOMEHOW fighting the distraction of last night\u2019s memories, Sienna had just sent in a completed physics project using the computronic resources in the den library when she ran into an elderly changeling. \u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d she said, catching the book she\u2019d knocked from his grasp. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, sir.\u201d</p><p>Dalton chuckled as he accepted the book, his white eyebrows bushy over dark, dark brown skin marked with a thousand laugh lines. \u201cMakes me sound about a hundred years old.\u201d</p><p>Sienna wasn\u2019t sure Dalton wasn\u2019t exactly that age. The man the kids in the den affectionately called a whitebeard wasn\u2019t a librarian, he was the Librarian, the repository of Pack knowledge. \u201cWere you undertaking research?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all up here.\u201d He tapped his temple, his sparkling eyes the same warm tawny brown as his granddaughter\u2019s. \u201cI came to get some light reading.\u201d Holding up the heavy tome she\u2019d caught, he beamed. \u201cIn the original French!\u201d</p><p>Sienna nodded as if she knew what he was talking about. \u201cI hope you enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I will.\u201d Tucking the book under his arm, he touched her on the shoulder as he passed.</p><p>Sienna blurted out, \u201cWait,\u201d before her courage deserted her.</p><p>\u201cYes, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Pack archives\u2014are they accessible to anyone?\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s eyes were piercing when he looked at her, leaving no doubt that whitebeard or not, his brain was as acute as it had always been. \u201cYes. But certain truths, while written, are kept out of reach\u2014because there are some wounds that don\u2019t need to be reopened.\u201d</p><p>Sienna felt her fingers curl into fists. \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you, young one?\u201d Dalton shook his head. \u201cThe histories I write give the facts, but for the heart of it, you must ask those who were there.\u201d</p><p>Sienna didn\u2019t move for several minutes after Dalton left, remembering the way Hawke had shut her down the one time she\u2019d brought up the past. He\u2019d held her last night, danced with her until the entire den seemed to go quiet, as if they were the only two awake in the hushed time between midnight and dawn. She\u2019d never felt more alive, more a woman. However, Dalton\u2019s words made her confront a stark truth: that despite the escalating physical contact, Hawke hadn\u2019t yet\u2014might never\u2014trust her with his secrets.</p><p>Sienna. Judd\u2019s telepathic voice, slicing through the bleakness of her thoughts. Hawke\u2019s office. We need to discuss what you told him about the cold fire.</p><p>The reminder of the danger stalking them was an icy trickle down her spine. I\u2019m on my way.</p><p>HAWKE noted Sienna\u2019s expressionless face, the flat ebony of her gaze, and scowled. \u201cYou release the X-fire to keep from reaching synergy, correct?\u201d he asked, figuring he\u2019d get to the bottom of the emotional change in her as soon as he had her alone.</p><p>A crisp nod, her stance that of a SnowDancer soldier in front of her alpha. \u201cEarthing helps me maintain a stable psychic balance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often do you earth?\u201d Judd had told him to ask the question, though the Psy male had refused, \u201cuntil he had more answers,\u201d to say why. It was a measure of Hawke\u2019s trust in the lieutenant that he\u2019d left it at that\u2014for now.</p><p>\u201cSeveral times over the past few months,\u201d Sienna admitted. \u201cBefore that, I was only doing it once or twice every half year. My theory is that the change is linked to my increasing control\u2014I\u2019m no longer releasing power inadvertently, so it builds up faster.\u201d</p><p>Judd spoke for the first time. \u201cDo you foresee doing it again soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d However, there was a hesitation in her words, a crack in her confidence. \u201cThe pattern\u2019s become less predictable of late, but that could be due to a simple fluctuation in my abilities. That\u2019s happened once or twice before, and it\u2019s always subsided without any discernible aftereffects.\u201d</p><p>Hawke pinned her with his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me the next time you need to earth.\u201d He wasn\u2019t letting her head out alone, not when the Psy might have her in their sights.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d never been called \u201csir\u201d with such insulting politeness. Wolf settling at the return of the acerbic edge in her voice because he didn\u2019t like seeing her lost and unsure, he turned to Judd. \u201cAnything else I should know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m still working my contacts.\u201d Turning toward the door, he said, \u201cSienna?\u201d</p><p>Hawke held up a hand. \u201cWe have something to discuss.\u201d</p><p>Judd looked up, met his eyes, but spoke to Sienna instead. \u201cWait outside.\u201d There was a command in his voice, that of a lieutenant speaking to a lower-ranking soldier. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hawke had the feeling that while Sienna might have argued with her uncle, she obeyed the lieutenant\u2014albeit with a tight set to her jaw\u2014sliding past Judd and into the corridor. Only when she was gone, the door shut, did Hawke raise an eyebrow at the Psy male who\u2019d returned to stand opposite him.</p><p>\u201cYou have my loyalty,\u201d Judd said in the quietest of tones, \u201cbut she has a piece of my heart.\u201d</p><p>Hawke had known this was coming, was ready for it. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSienna is strong,\u201d Judd continued as if he hadn\u2019t heard Hawke\u2019s vow,</p><p>\u201colder than she should be. But in many ways, she\u2019s far more vulnerable than any other female in this den. She broke Silence at a critical age, and it altered her emotional psyche.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf wasn\u2019t pleased at being taken to task, but he listened. \u201cFrom what I see,\u201d he said, thinking of her empty eyes when she\u2019d walked into the office, \u201cshe seems damn good at reining in emotions.\u201d</p><p>It should\u2019ve made him happy that she had the capacity to maintain that distance\u2014he always chose lovers who wouldn\u2019t be hurt by his inability to give them everything. But last night, as he indulged himself by claiming the first level of intimate skin privileges, he\u2019d discovered something\u2014when it came to Sienna, he was beyond selfish, beyond possessive. She was his. And he wanted all of her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m worried about.\u201d Judd\u2019s eyes were arctic blue with intent when they met Hawke\u2019s. \u201cShe has no off switch when it comes to those she loves. She will do anything to protect them, even murder. Do you understand what I\u2019m telling you?\u201d</p> <p>Hawke curved his lips in a faint smile.\u201cSounds like a predatory changeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Except unlike a changeling, she didn\u2019t grow up around simple kindness, much less touch and affection.\u201d A harsh reminder that Sienna hadn\u2019t even had the cold childhood of most Psy. \u201cOn an intellectual level, she might understand that intimate physical contact doesn\u2019t mean a commitment, but when it comes to you, that isn\u2019t going to matter a damn.\u201d Cool words no less forceful for being delivered in a tempered voice. \u201cOnce you turn that key, be sure you\u2019re ready.\u201d It was a warning.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf heard it loud and clear\u2014but it also heard what Judd didn\u2019t say. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you telling me to stay the fuck away from her?\u201d he asked, because while it was too late for that, it angered him that her family hadn\u2019t thought to protect her.</p><p>Judd\u2019s own anger was an icy whip. \u201cYou insist on seeing her as a child when the truth is, she was forced to make adult decisions long ago. She\u2019s earned the right to live her life as she pleases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t that piss you off? That she was never allowed to be a child?\u201d It sure as hell pissed him off.</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014but she survived.\u201d Not even by the flicker of an eyelash did Judd betray the depth of emotion that had to be riding him, but the chair next to him turned into a pile of splinters between one breath and the next.</p> <p>Hawke\u2019s wolf saw, understood. \u201cYou\u2019d kill them all if you could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSienna could do that herself.\u201d</p><p>SIENNA knew they were talking about her in there, and though it frustrated her to be shut out, she\u2019d been part of the pack long enough to understand hierarchy. The truth was, annoyance at situations like today\u2019s aside, she appreciated it.</p><p>SnowDancer, at its core, operated very much like a military unit\u2014albeit one with a warm emotional center, and that was a pattern of behavior her mind understood and accepted, the strict nature of it acting as an outside restraint on her abilities. Sienna was deathly certain she wouldn\u2019t have survived in a more laissez-faire environment.</p><p>However, that didn\u2019t mean she wouldn\u2019t be letting both Hawke and Judd know what she thought of their arrogance in excluding her from a conversation that had her as its focus. The irritated thought had just passed through her mind when a brilliant spark of joy burst onto her psychic senses. Toby. Her brother had phenomenal shields, but he tended to broadcast when in high spirits. What\u2019s got you so happy?</p><p>Sascha\u2019s here.</p><p>Sienna frowned. Really? It didn\u2019t fit with what she\u2019d witnessed of Lucas\u2019s protective nature.</p><p>Lucas is with her. And like a hundred other soldiers.</p> <p>That made more sense. Be good.</p><p>Drew says I should be bad sometimes.</p><p>He\u2019s a terrible influence. But she let Toby feel her laughter, hear that she was joking. Just don\u2019t be too bad.</p><p>A starburst of love from a brother who\u2019d had this aspect of his abilities buried in the Net. Then Toby was gone from her mind and the door to Hawke\u2019s office was being pulled open. \u201cSascha and Lucas are here,\u201d she said to Hawke when he followed Judd out into the corridor.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He held up a sleek black phone. \u201cRiley will handle anything they need. We\u201d\u2014his eyes locked to Sienna\u2019s\u2014\u201care heading out for a while.\u201d</p><p>Per their agreement, she didn\u2019t question the order until Judd left them at the junction. \u201cYou were talking about me,\u201d she began. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncles,\u201d Hawke interrupted, \u201cbrothers, fathers have always had and will always have private \u2018discussions\u2019 with males who want to touch their women. You\u2019re never going to win that argument\u201d\u2014a playful tug on her braid\u2014\u201cso give it up.\u201d</p><p>Glaring at him, she pulled her hair from his grasp. \u201cThat is the most sexist statement I have ever heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not true.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cAsk Riley sometime about the nice little chat Mercy\u2019s brothers and father had with him.\u201d</p><p>Irritation derailed by curiosity, she said, \u201cWhat about Indigo?\u201d The lieutenant was the third-highest ranking individual in the pack, needed no one\u2019s protection.</p><p>\u201cYou know Abel,\u201d he said, referring to Indigo\u2019s father. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>Sienna knew right then that the arrogant wolf had won, because Abel adored his girls, had probably threatened to rip out key parts of Drew\u2019s anatomy. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked, foul-tempered and not bothering to hide it.</p><p>\u201cIn a bit.\u201d Nodding his head toward one of the conference rooms, he said, \u201cToby\u2019s in there.\u201d An unasked question, silent consent if she needed to go to her brother.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d she said, wondering how the wolf-eyed male could be so infuriating and so very wonderful at the same time. \u201cHe loves his lessons with Sascha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gets something out of it, too, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a cardinal empath. Toby\u2019s E abilities are barely 3 on the Gradient.\u201d Her brother\u2019s cardinal status came from his telepathy.</p><p>\u201cBut he is an E in some part,\u201d Hawke pointed out. \u201cHe exists.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she thought, Hawke was right. It explained the hereto inexplicable depth of Sascha\u2019s joy whenever she was with Toby. \u201cI\u2019ve never met another X.\u201d She didn\u2019t know why she told him that.</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t respond until they\u2019d exited the den and were heading out on a path that would lead eventually to the training run that had gotten ever more fiendish since Riaz\u2019s return from a stint abroad. \u201cHow about a weak X?\u201d he asked, his face lifted up to the clean, bright Sierra sunshine.</p><p>Beautiful man. \u201cIt\u2019s such a rare designation,\u201d she said when he shot her a questioning glance, \u201cthat there\u2019s probably less than ten of us at any given time.\u201d Even that was a generous estimate, considering what she\u2019d gleaned about their life expectancy. \u201cThe theory is that Xs below 2 on the Gradient don\u2019t manifest, so no one ever realizes. As for the others . . . I know of one who died during my teen years. I heard of another two who died before I was brought in.\u201d</p><p>So much sadness, so much death.</p><p>\u201cOf the two other living Xs I knew of in the Net,\u201d she continued, \u201cone was psychotic and the other hypersensitive.\u201d It felt strange to talk of the X designation without feeling the vicious spear of pain down her spine that was the first level of dissonance, a warning not to speak of things the Council would prefer to keep secret. \u201cIt was possible I\u2019d set him off if we came into close contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t that volatility make him a danger?\u201d Hawke pushed silver-gold strands off his face, catching her eye.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she murmured, \u201cbut he must\u2019ve been useful in some capacity because they permitted him to live.\u201d Hawke had, she thought, the most fascinating hair, unusual and beautiful as his pelt in wolf form. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you grow out your hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean like Luc?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cNot me, I guess.\u201d</p><p>She had to admit she loved the way the strands brushed his nape, just long enough to be rebellious . . . to invite the caress of a woman\u2019s fingers. Unsure where they were in terms of a relationship, what he\u2019d accept, she tucked her hands under her armpits. \u201cWhy are you so like your wolf in human form?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a time when I needed it to be the dominant aspect even when I was in human form\u2014the wolf was more mature than the boy.\u201d He led her past the training run and into the trees. \u201cMy wolf was always near the surface. The experience heightened the effect.\u201d</p><p>Startled at getting a straight answer, she scrambled to gather her thoughts. \u201cI\u2019ve heard changelings say it can be dangerous to spend too long with the animal in control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t be helped. I was fifteen when I became alpha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur alpha was dead, and so were most of the lieutenants and senior soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why SnowDancer has such a young population.\u201d Nowhere near the level of older people you\u2019d expect. She went to ask another question when she realized they\u2019d stopped in the shadow of a slender tree, its branches hung with elegant leaves that shimmered in the wind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you,\u201d he said, \u201ca twenty-minute head start.\u201d A pale-eyed wolf watched her out of a human face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 19</p><p>THE FINE HAIRS on her arms rose. \u201cTo do what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to get to the lake before I catch you.\u201d A slow, provoking smile that kicked her straight in the gut. \u201cLet\u2019s see if you\u2019re smart enough to fool the wolf.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would I want to do that?\u201d Sienna had paid her dues, earned her status. \u201cIs this a test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Folding her arms, she spread her feet in a defensive stance. \u201cThen I don\u2019t have to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking you to.\u201d He angled his head to the side, the motion nothing human. \u201cAfraid you\u2019ll lose?\u201d</p><p>She set her jaw. \u201cI can beat you with my eyes closed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d The wolf was laughing at her.</p><p>If she\u2019d been able to growl, she\u2019d have done it right then. \u201cAre you allowed to circle to the lake and wait for me?\u201d He was faster, would win even with the head start.</p><p>But he shook his head, strands of that gorgeous hair sliding over his forehead. \u201cWhat would be the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>She knew he\u2019d manipulated her into accepting the challenge, but her competitive streak had kicked in, wouldn\u2019t allow her to back down. \u201cFine. Start the clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone.\u201d He closed his eyes. \u201cBefore you go, I should tell you what you get if you win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA surprise.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she very much wanted the ability to growl. \u201cWhat if I lose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might throw you in the lake. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>Not trusting him an inch when he had that smile flirting with his lips, she took off. He was far, far faster\u2014she\u2019d seen him run, and the sight had brought her heart into her throat. Built like the most beautiful living machine, all fluid sinew and tendon, muscle and strength, he so outclassed her when it came to speed that she didn\u2019t stand a chance.</p><p>But there were other ways to tangle with a wolf.</p><p>MAN and wolf were both a little disappointed in Sienna. She\u2019d gone in a straight line to the lake, hadn\u2019t even tried to use the nearby waterways to mask her scent. The shining thread of wild spice and autumn leaves spilled out ahead of him, an unmistakable lure to his wolf. He\u2019d have to have a\u2014\u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>He was upside down, watching the pine-needle strewn earth pass this way and that several feet below him, his right ankle caught securely in a rope. Twisting to stare up at his ankle, he shook his head. Stared again. Started to laugh. Smart, smart girl. It wasn\u2019t a rope at all, but a thick vine that grew everywhere around here. Sienna had to have spent most of her twenty-minute head start laying this trap. A trap he would\u2019ve normally avoided\u2014except that he\u2019d written off her skills on this playing field. That\u2019d teach him to be an arrogant ass.</p><p>Contorting his body, he went to slice the vine with a claw.</p> <p>Only to fall short just shy of his goal.</p><p>Swearing, he tried again, and again. By the time he got the damn thing off, he\u2019d painted the air blue, and it didn\u2019t exactly help when he landed hard on his tailbone. The wolf was not amused . . . except that it was because this was a game. Getting rid of the remnants of the vine around his ankle, he stretched to reset his muscles, then restarted following her scent\u2014being far more careful this time.</p><p>He saw the vine she\u2019d strung across the path and lifted his feet over it without tripping the snare. Only to find his damn ankle\u2014the same one\u2014stuck in a hole. Growling, he brushed away the leaves to discover the brat had dug three holes on the other side. He\u2019d managed to find the center one.</p><p>Clever, his wolf thought, delighted with her, very clever.</p><p>Digging out his abused ankle, he spent several minutes undoing the trap so others wouldn\u2019t be caught unawares\u2014as he had a feeling she\u2019d known he would\u2014then changed tack. Instead of moving directly toward her scent, he took a longer route, coming in at an angle. He saw where she\u2019d rested, glimpsed another smart, sneaky trap. It cost him precious minutes to undo it but far fewer than if he\u2019d been caught up in it.</p><p>Five minutes later, a long strand of ruby red hair glinted at him from a bush, the area thick with her scent. Certain he\u2019d run her to ground, he went to part the bush . . . and only just snapped his hand back in time. His curvy little brand of trouble had almost led him into a thicket of poison ivy. Oh, now he was mad.</p><p>Grinning, he looked down and saw her sweatshirt hidden under the bush, likely pushed there by a stick. \u201cCrafty Psy.\u201d Aware now of the caliber of opponent he had on his hands, he began to track her in earnest, flying over the earth at inhuman speed, every one of his senses on alert.</p><p>There.</p><p>She was a mere kilometer from the lake, hair tied back, her arms bared by her T-shirt as she knelt on the ground laying another trap for him. Instead of pouncing on her, he moved silently around to watch. Such a quick mind she had, he thought, seeing how she used the springy branch of a tree and another one of the vines to create her latest snare.</p><p>Every other opponent he\u2019d had in this game had tried to mask his or her scent, to confuse and disorient. She was the single one who\u2019d thought to use her time to set traps\u2014and the wolf appreciated her cunning. It was only her lack of speed that had allowed him to catch her. But caught her he had . . . and he had a few tricks of his own.</p><p>SIENNA went motionless as her nape prickled in warning. Nothing. No sound, definitely no shout like the one that had gone up when Hawke had walked into the first trap. She\u2019d been less than ten meters away, having had barely enough time to pull it together. Oh, he\u2019d been pissed.</p><p>But then he\u2019d laughed.</p><p>She\u2019d never expected that, and it had made her understand. A game. They were playing a game. Except for with Toby and Marlee, she\u2019d never played a game before that wasn\u2019t connected to learning military tactics. Even with her brother and cousin, she was focused on their enjoyment, more a coordinator than a participant.</p><p>This\u2014it was play for play\u2019s sake.</p><p>The efficient X-Psy inside of her said she was wasting time, but she shushed that voice. Because she\u2019d never felt as light, as young as she did at this moment, sneaking through an ancient forest, trying to outwit a wolf with pale blue eyes and hair of silver-go\u2014\u201c?!#\u201d</p><p>The sound that erupted from her throat was unintelligible as she found herself dangling by one ankle at least five feet off the ground. \u201cNo,\u201d she muttered, staring around in disbelief. But of course the answer was right there in her current predicament. \u201cYou win!\u201d she finally called out in a fit of temper.</p><p>He appeared out of the forest, looking at her with quizzical eyes. \u201cWhat are you doing up there, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRrrr.\u201d She slapped her hands over her mouth to still the feral sound.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s cheeks creased into a delighted smile. \u201cDo that again.\u201d</p><p>Never. \u201cGet me down.\u201d</p><p>He rocked back on his heels. \u201cWhat do I get in exchange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t fry you to a crisp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t anyway,\u201d he said with such insouciant confidence it was pure provocation.</p><p>She shot a bolt of fire past his hair, but he\u2019d already shifted sideways. \u201cTut, tut. That\u2019s cheating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUrgh!\u201d Twisting her body with serious effort from her abdominal muscles, she went to aim her hand at the vine, sure she could sever it with her abilities.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll hurt like hell when you fall.\u201d</p><p>She paused. He\u2019d set his trap so she dangled higher than he had. It would hurt. Dropping back down, she blew out a breath. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d It was a snarl; she\u2019d never snarled before.</p><p>Walking close enough that he could put one hand under her nape, the other on her lower back, tilting her head up into a more comfortable position, he leaned in so close that all she could see was translucent ice blue. \u201cA kiss for the big, bad wolf.\u201d</p><p>Her throat locked, the words stuck in her throat.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t close the distance between them. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>Swallowing, she nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou have to say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she managed to force out, gripping his shoulder with one hand.</p><p>\u201cYes what?\u201d</p><p>Some of her frustration reignited, returning her voice. \u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t think I care how far I fall!\u201d</p><p>Laughing lips descended on hers, one big hand cupping her cheek as his other held up her neck.</p><p>It was\u2014</p><p>It was . . . She had no words for it, this shock of sensation that speared through her, raw and primal, swelling her breasts, melting the place between her thighs. All because those firm lips were tasting hers with a playful gentleness interspersed with more than a few nips and licks. She moaned into his mouth, got a nip on her lower lip as her reward.</p><p>Then he licked his tongue across her own.</p><p>Oh, God.</p><p>Wanting more, she dared reach out with her own tongue. He made a low, deep sound in his throat and returned the caress with interest, his fingers massaging her nape. The merest pause for breath before her upper lip was being sucked, her lower lip captured between strong masculine teeth for a teasing bite.</p><p>When it felt as if he\u2019d lift his head, she arched toward him. He opened his mouth over her own, danced his tongue against hers, before breaking the kiss with a nuzzling slowness. \u201cI\u2019d have given you another kiss,\u201d he murmured, nipping at her pulse with his teeth, \u201cbut you made me mad.\u201d</p><p>Dazed, she said, \u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you really think I\u2019d let you fall?\u201d A bite lower down on her neck. Harder this time.</p><p>She jerked, hand clenching on that shoulder heavy with muscle. \u201cYou can\u2019t go around biting me whenever you feel like it.\u201d It was very alpha male behavior, and he hardly needed any more encouragement.</p><p>He licked his tongue over the mark. \u201cCut the vine.\u201d</p><p>This time, she didn\u2019t question him, using a targeted laser of cold fire to sever the trap. He caught her so fast she didn\u2019t even experience the sensation of falling for an instant. Lowering her to her feet, he held her against him as she got her balance back, one of his hands on her lower back, the other playing with strands of her hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she looked up, he was watching her with an absolute focus that stole the air from her lungs. \u201cYou\u2019re a good playmate,\u201d he said, dipping his head to speak against her lips. \u201cYou get to pick the next game.\u201d</p><p>Stealing tiny kisses as she stood with her chest pressed to his, she felt the vibration of his growl in every inch of her. \u201cWhen?\u201d she managed to get out, her nipples hard little points, her breasts so sensitized she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d be able to take it if he touched her.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d Leaning down, he nuzzled at her, only taking a small bite before rubbing his lips over the spot. \u201cTime to go back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust a minute more.\u201d Scared this was a dream, she dared to wrap her arms around his neck, stroke her fingers over his nape. He was much taller, but he stayed in position so she could hold him, his breath hot against her skin. Just for a minute.</p><p>LARA wasn\u2019t surprised to see Walker in her office that night. He\u2019d come to her the previous evening, too. The part of her that was still bruised had her keeping a wary emotional distance, but that same part held her complex, painful feelings for the quiet Psy male, and they left her unable to ask him to leave\u2014especially when she sensed a subtle difference in him, a lessening in that wall of reserve.</p><p>However, not wanting to set herself up for another fall, she\u2019d brought up something she was sure would have him making a fast exit last night. \u201cYou never talk about Marlee\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>To her shock, she\u2019d gotten an answer.</p><p>\u201cHer name was Yelene,\u201d he\u2019d said, his expression telling her nothing of his emotions toward the woman who had borne him a child. \u201cWe lived together in a family unit, both of us of the opinion that psychologically speaking, it was the most secure way to bring up Marlee and, later, Toby.\u201d</p> <p>Such a cold rationale on the surface, and yet beneath it was a love that had led him to walk into near-certain death on the slim chance that the children would find sanctuary. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your sister.\u201d She knew Walker was the eldest of the three siblings, Judd the youngest. Sienna and Toby\u2019s mother had fallen in the middle . . . and died far too soon.</p><p>\u201cKristine was gifted but troubled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad Toby had you to turn to.\u201d Because Walker, he would\u2019ve understood a child\u2019s pain at the loss, even in Silence.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t protect Sienna\u201d\u2014dark, edgy words\u2014\u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t have allowed anyone to seize Toby from us.\u201d</p><p>Devastatingly conscious of what it must\u2019ve cost him to see Sienna taken by Ming, she hadn\u2019t asked the question on the tip of her tongue yesterday. Tonight, however, as they sat at the small table in the break room, his long legs encroaching on her space, she couldn\u2019t contain it any longer. \u201cYelene,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat was she like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur genes were a good match.\u201d His big body betrayed nothing of his inner thoughts as he gave her that nonanswer. \u201cIt was predicted that we\u2019d create high-Gradient offspring, and Marlee is living proof of the veracity of the geneticists\u2019 predictions.\u201d</p> <p>Lack of overt body language or not, Lara knew he wanted her to back off. But she had no intention of turning back the clock, of returning their relationship to what it had been before the kiss\u2014when she\u2019d allowed him to dictate the boundaries in that subtle way of his. \u201cYou felt something for her, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Every instinct she had urged her to touch him, to connect with him on the most basic level, but Walker hadn\u2019t acceded her those skin privileges, and even if they had had more between them than this strange friendship, he wasn\u2019t the kind of man with whom a woman could demand.</p><p>\u201cI was Silent,\u201d he said, his jean-clad leg brushing her own in a rough caress that made her breath catch in spite of her warning not to let herself read too much into his visits, his words. \u201cI felt nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalker.\u201d</p><p>He put down the coffee she\u2019d made him. \u201cThere was no love or affection\u2014not as you feel it. But there was, I believed, a true commitment and loyalty to the family unit. I was wrong.\u201d So cold and final, the statement told her the subject was now off-limits.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Lara\u2019s determination that had her fighting his dominance to say what she did next, but the deepest instincts of her healer\u2019s heart. \u201cShe hurt you.\u201d</p><p>A tendon pulled taut on his jaw. \u201cShe made the most logical choice when the entire family was slated for rehabilitation.\u201d Walker would never forget the day, the minute, he was served the edict and told he had three days to put his affairs, and those of the minors under his care, in order; three days to prepare his daughter and the boy he considered a son to undergo a psychic brainwipe that would turn them into vegetables suitable only for the most menial tasks.</p><p>\u201cAccording to the rehabilitation order, the Lauren line had been judged \u2018unstable\u2019 and \u2018undesirable.\u2019 \u201d Kristine\u2019s suicide had been listed as one of the pieces of evidence, but Judd and Walker had always known that to be nothing but a convenient excuse. \u201cYelene\u2019s name wasn\u2019t on the notice.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d gone home to discuss the situation with her, to lay out the plans he and Judd had put in place, both of them having seen the writing on the wall when the extent of Sienna\u2019s powers became clear. Add in Judd\u2019s telekinetic strength and Walker\u2019s telepathy, as well as Marlee\u2019s and Toby\u2019s nascent abilities, and the Lauren family had become a threat that needed to be neutralized.</p> <p>\u201cShe was packing her bags when I walked in.\u201d At first, he\u2019d believed she was preparing for a defection attempt. To this day, he didn\u2019t know what had stopped him from sharing their plans\u2014perhaps some part of him had always understood that though Yelene had carried Marlee in her womb, their child was only a collection of cells to her . . . a replaceable entity. \u201cWhen she saw me, she said point-blank that she didn\u2019t intend for her genes to die out alongside mine.\u201d</p><p>Lara\u2019s pupils dilated, taking over those tawny irises. \u201cI can\u2019t understand.\u201d Disbelieving bewilderment. \u201cI never will. All I can do is . . .\u201d She put her hand on the table, palm up.</p><p>A silent offer of surcease.</p><p>Walker had learned to touch since his defection, learned to hug, to give pats on the back or a squeeze on the shoulder. But he\u2019d never touched a woman for no reason except that it would soothe something jagged in him to do so. Lara\u2019s fingers began to curl when he didn\u2019t move, her hand starting to slide away.</p><p>His fingers closed around her wrist before he was aware of moving his hand, his thumb on the fluttering beat of her pulse. Her skin was so soft, stirring fantasies of what it would be like to explore the skin of her breasts, her inner thighs. Softer still, he thought, she\u2019d be softer still in those places.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Yelene,\u201d she said, a quiet strength to her that had compelled him from the first. \u201cI won\u2019t ever walk away from those who are mine.\u201d</p><p>No, that wasn\u2019t the way she was built. But\u2014\u201cYelene has nothing to do with this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d A whisper that put him on notice that she wasn\u2019t about to back off. \u201cWhat she did hurt you on a level you won\u2019t accept, and that hurt continues to drive the decisions you make about women, about relationships.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old bonds,\u201d he said, holding that tawny gaze so she would know he told her the utter truth, \u201cthe love for the children, they survived Yelene, survived the defection. But the rest of me is damaged.\u201d In spite of his need for her, he wouldn\u2019t lie . . . even though he knew his words would push her into the arms of one of the other men drawn to the warm glow of her spirit.</p><p>His mind went cold with anger, but he wrenched it back, knowing he had no right to the emotion. \u201cI was too long in Silence.\u201d</p><p>Lara shook her head, something in her expression he couldn\u2019t read, fine lines around her mouth, fanning out from the corners of her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve formed new bonds of loyalty, of trust, with packmates. We\u2019re . . . friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He rubbed his thumb over her pulse, wanted to touch his lips to the spot. Physical hunger wasn\u2019t the problem, but Lara wasn\u2019t a woman for whom that would ever be enough. She was a healer, built for family, for laughing children, and a mate who knew how to love with the same fierce depth of heart as she\u2019d love him. \u201cI don\u2019t appear to have the capacity to feel anything deeper.\u201d Maybe the scar tissue was too thick, or maybe a critical aspect of his emotional psyche had been broken beyond repair, but there was a wall inside him that nothing could penetrate.</p><p>Not even Lara.</p><p>RECOVERED FROM COMPUTER 2(A) TAGS: PERSONAL CORRESPONDENCE, FATHER, ACTION REQUIRED2</p><p>FROM: Alice &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>TO: Dad &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>DATE: April 10th, 1973 at 11:44pm</p><p>SUBJECT: re: hello</p><p>Dad,</p><p>I\u2019m so excited! Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t be, but I may have found the most extraordinary correlation. It began when I was able to track down the descendants of a woman named Jena Akim, an X-Psy who lived in the sixteenth century and was part of a high-Gradient family. The information on her and her family is more legend than fact, but if true, it might be the answer.</p><p>What is crucial is that unlike most Xs, who are put into specialized training as soon as they begin to show their X tendencies, Jena was never separated from her family unit. That of course is the key and why this has been missed so far. Perhaps it might even be that it is hidden or less visible in weaker Gradient minds\u2014but I can\u2019t draw any conclusions until I\u2019m able to confirm if my theory is correct.</p><p>If so, it cannot be coincidence\u2014my studies show that the rules of the psychic plane are multi-layered and textured, so complex that even the Psy don\u2019t have a handle on them, but, and this is critical, there are rules.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Alice</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>SIENNA OPENED THE door the night after the kiss to find Hawke waiting, his hand braced on the doorjamb. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReady to play?\u201d the wolf asked.</p><p>Her heart kicked against her ribs, the memory of the wild bite, of his taste entangling with the blatant masculinity of his scent\u2014but just like with his previous visit, his phone beeped before she could respond to the invitation.</p><p>\u201cThis better be important,\u201d he barked into the receiver, clearly as frustrated.</p> <p>A pause and then he snapped upright. Reading his expression, she went for her work boots, tugging them on with hard, fast motions. He glanced over but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he asked, his tone so calm and controlled she knew something bad had happened. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right. Do what you can. I\u2019m on my way with Lara.\u201d</p><p>Sienna jerked up her head at the name of the SnowDancer healer. Pulling her unbound hair into a rough ponytail, she pushed past him into the corridor. \u201cI\u2019ll alert Lara,\u201d she mouthed as he asked the person on the other end for further details.</p><p>Eyes very much that of the alpha, not the sensual predatory changeling male who\u2019d come to her door, he broke from the phone conversation to say, \u201cBring her to the lower garage. She\u2019ll need extra supplies\u2014more than one injured. Don\u2019t bother Judd. He needs to recover from some teleportation he did earlier.\u201d</p><p>Leaving the instant he gave another nod, she ran to the healer\u2019s apartment, which happened to be right next to the infirmary. No answer. But when she looked in the infirmary itself, she found Lara at her desk, reading some kind of medical journal. Giving the healer a concise summary of everything she knew, she helped gather the supplies.</p> <p>\u201cYou did level-two medic training, yes?\u201d Lara asked, moving fast and efficient.</p><p>Sienna acted the pack mule as Lara loaded her up with gear. \u201cI completed the level-three class while I was with the leopards.\u201d All soldiers were required to have a secondary proficiency\u2014a tech course would\u2019ve been far less demanding for Sienna, given the way her mind worked, but being able to help people on any level was a gift beyond price for her, a tiny way to balance the violence of the X-marker.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I got the competency notice.\u201d The healer nodded, as if making a decision. \u201cLucy did a double shift, so I\u2019m not waking her up,\u201d she said, naming the young SnowDancer who\u2019d just finished nursing school to take up a full-time position as Lara\u2019s assistant. \u201cYou\u2019re drafted.\u201d Her phone beeped at that moment. A quick conversation later, she said, \u201cThat was Hawke. We\u2019re going to need more help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudd isn\u2019t wiped out.\u201d Sienna didn\u2019t know where her uncle had been teleporting, but she\u2019d seen him at dinner with the children, was able to gauge his energy levels. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to teleport us down,\u201d she said, aware Lara had been briefed on his Tk, including his ability to heal using telekinesis on the cell level, \u201cbut he can help with the injured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet him,\u201d Lara said, then rubbed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to wake poor Lucy up after all.\u201d</p><p>Five frantic minutes later, Lara and Sienna reached the garage with a couple of packmates who\u2019d pitched in to carry the gear, to discover that Judd had beaten them there. \u201cHawke\u2019s already gone,\u201d he told them, strapping the supplies onto the bed of the truck. \u201cI\u2019ll drive you two down. Another team will follow in a bigger truck with stretchers to help ferry the wounded back to the den.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLucy\u2019s coming as well.\u201d Lara turned to look over her shoulder at the entrance to the garage. \u201cShe should be\u2014There she is.\u201d</p><p>A rumpled, red-eyed Lucy scrambled into the backseat beside Sienna. \u201cWhat\u2019re we dealing with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMultiple gunshot wounds,\u201d Lara said, \u201claser burns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny critical injuries?\u201d Judd pulled out and onto a narrow forest track. \u201cI may be able to get you down there faster, but it\u2019ll wipe me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be better if you\u2019re able to help with the healing. Hawke will hold everyone until we get there.\u201d</p><p>Judd glanced at the healer, verbalizing the question Sienna had been about to ask. \u201cI realize Hawke can push his strength into those with whom he has a blood bond, but is he able to reach others in the pack as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Lara was checking her phone for updates as she spoke, in touch with the person who had made the original call for help. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy or as effective as the blood bond with the lieutenants, or the bond he has with me, but he can hold them there with the power of his presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHierarchy,\u201d Sienna said, realizing the true depth of the foundation that underpinned the pack for the first time. \u201cWolves will obey their alpha, even in that extremity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Sienna turned to Lucy when the nurse reached back to plait her sleepmussed hair. \u201cI can do that if you like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be okay with so little sleep?\u201d Lucy reminded Sienna of Riley, though they had no physical similarities. It was, she thought, the calm stability of their natures. From everything she\u2019d heard so far, that solid calm would be much needed tonight.</p><p>Lucy nodded. \u201cGot used to it when I did some work for CTX during my breaks from nursing school\u2014the news sleeps for no one.\u201d Her stomach growled on the heels of that statement. \u201cDamn, forgot to grab something to eat. Crashed without dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d Judd threw a granola bar over the seat. \u201cHad it in my jacket pocket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI avow my love for you here and now,\u201d Lucy said as she tore open the wrapper.</p><p>Sienna wondered if Judd had really had the bar, or if he\u2019d executed a deft telekinetic \u201cfetch.\u201d Having witnessed the price it demanded from him, she knew telekinesis wasn\u2019t an easy ability in any sense of the word, but it was one she wouldn\u2019t have minded in place of the fire and pain that was the X designation.</p><p>It was that kind of violence, however, that awaited them on a border section of den territory that backed onto DarkRiver land, an area thick with firs that pierced the glittering beauty of the night sky. Two of the cats were there, one of them performing first aid. The other, she realized, as her vision adapted to the glow of the field lamps stuck into the ground, had been shot through the arm\u2014and yet he was attempting to do what he could for the others, all of whom were more badly injured.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d Lucy whispered, grabbing a medical kit from the truck. \u201cRiordan must\u2019ve come down early for the shift change.\u201d</p><p>Sienna followed the nurse\u2019s gaze to see that the big, playful wolf was bleeding heavily from a wound in his abdomen as he sat propped up against a tree. \u201cHe\u2019s hurt bad.\u201d So was Elias. The senior soldier appeared to have been hit with a laser along one side, his burnt flesh no doubt causing him horrible pain, though he\u2019d gritted his teeth against the screams. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hawke?\u201d</p><p>They both realized the answer at the same instant. Simran, Elias\u2019s partner on watch and the woman whose place on the border Riordan would\u2019ve taken, was down, blood seeping from a wound in her neck. Sienna knew it was a fatal injury\u2014or should\u2019ve been. Hawke knelt beside Simran, his hand clamped over the bloody gash, such intense focus in those wolf-pale eyes that she knew he was holding the sentry to life with his will alone.</p><p>It was only when she saw the light gleam over his naked back that she understood he\u2019d run here, his speed outstripping any vehicle when it came to this place of mountain and forest, rivers and lakes. But to have reached Simran before the sentry slipped away . . . It was unimaginable, the sheer fury of his speed.</p><p>\u201cJudd\u2019s got Riordan,\u201d she said to Lucy, compartmentalizing because if she allowed herself to think about the people who lay bleeding on the cold earth, it would paralyze her. \u201cYou take Eli and I\u2019ll check out the leopards.\u201d</p><p>Barker didn\u2019t protest when she sat him down against the rough bark of an ancient pine, having lost enough blood that he\u2019d started to waver on his feet. \u201cThrough and through,\u201d she said after inspecting the wound. \u201cI don\u2019t think the bullet caused any major damage, but it needs to be looked at by someone better qualified.\u201d Slotting an antibiotic magazine into the pressure injector, she placed it against his skin.</p><p>The medicine punched through to his system an instant later. She followed it up with a painkiller before he could tell her he didn\u2019t need it. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you want Tamsyn to look at this?\u201d she said, referring to the DarkRiver healer.</p><p>It was Barker\u2019s partner, Rina, who answered, having returned to his side. \u201cAs long as you think he can wait another hour or so? Tammy\u2019s on her way.\u201d</p><p>Sienna checked Barker\u2019s vital signs using a scanner. \u201cHe\u2019s stable for now.\u201d Glancing up at a slight sound, she realized the clearing was ringed by wild wolves, their bodies sleek shadows in the dark.</p><p>\u201cThey arrived with Hawke,\u201d Rina said, shaking her head in disbelief. \u201cI think they\u2019re standing guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Sienna began to disinfect the mangled flesh\u2014to Barker\u2019s withheld hiss. \u201cHow did you end up in the middle of this?\u201d As to what this was, that would come later, after the injured were safe.</p><p>\u201cOur watch overlaps with Elias and Simran\u2019s,\u201d Rina said as Sienna nodded for the voluptuous blonde soldier to press sterile pads over both sides of the wound so she could bandage it up for the time being. \u201cWe sometimes stop for a couple of minutes, shoot the breeze. We\u2019d barely gotten here tonight when those Psy bastards came out of nowhere.\u201d A pause, a wince. \u201cNo offense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone taken.\u201d Sienna knew who she was, knew too that had things been different, she might have ended up one of the Council\u2019s pet killers. \u201cThey teleported in?\u201d</p><p>Rina brushed Barker\u2019s rich brown hair back from his sweat-soaked forehead, tucking her body even closer to his in that changeling way. \u201cRappelled down from a stealthcraft.\u201d</p><p>That made sense, because teleport-capable Tks were a limited commodity\u2014though you wouldn\u2019t know it from the way Henry Scott had sacrificed several of his in recent months. \u201cHow did they get you all so fast?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOverwhelmed us with sheer force. It was obvious they meant to leave no survivors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe craft was close to silent,\u201d Barker said, leaning into Rina\u2019s tender touch, \u201cbut we caught a hint of it the second before they began to rappel.\u201d He clenched his jaw as Sienna fixed the bandage, the painkiller obviously not strong enough for the bone-deep pain of the wound.</p><p>Calculating his body mass and concluding it was safe, Sienna upped the dosage.</p> <p>That he didn\u2019t object told her how bad he was hurting. \u201cThat,\u201d he continued after she put down the pressure injector, \u201cand the fact Reen, Riordan, and I were here tipped the balance\u2014they weren\u2019t expecting the three of us.\u201d</p><p>Sienna\u2019s gut went cold with the slowly dawning realization that the attempted murder of five people was only the tip of the iceberg. \u201cIf you start to feel worse,\u201d she said to Barker as she finished up, \u201cI want to know right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d White grooves bracketed his mouth.</p><p>\u201cHow bad,\u201d she said, \u201cwould it suck to have \u2018stupid moron died of shock\u2019 on your gravestone?\u201d</p><p>A roll of bright hazel eyes. \u201cDefinitely trained by Indigo,\u201d he muttered, skin sheened by cold sweat. \u201cIf I don\u2019t tell, Rina\u2019ll tattle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s my job, doofus.\u201d Rina pretend thumped him on the forehead. Satisfied, Sienna got up and walked to where Lucy sat beside Eli, doing what she could for the now-unconscious soldier. Burns charred the entire left-hand side of his body, glimpses of raw pink flesh beneath. \u201cYou sedated him?\u201d Sienna thought of little Sakura, what it would do to her to see her father so hurt. And Eli\u2019s mate, Yuki . . .</p><p>\u201cHe was in a lot of pain.\u201d Tight words, anger contained. \u201cHe needs Lara, but Simran and Riordan were more critical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill Lara be able to heal him?\u201d Nausea churned within her as she knelt, helpless, beside the soldier . . . because she could burn a living being, too. Worse than any laser.</p><p>\u201cYes, but it\u2019ll take her some time.\u201d</p><p>Thank God. \u201cAnything I can do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp me shove these sticks into the ground so the thermal blanket doesn\u2019t touch his skin when I unfold it over him.\u201d</p> <p>That task done, Sienna rose to see that Lara had moved from Simran to join Judd at Riordan\u2019s side\u2014the young male had also lost consciousness, his face leached of color. Not far away, Hawke had Simran curled up in his lap, her head tucked under his chin, her sleek black hair cascading over his arm. Noticing the woman was shivering, Sienna ran back to the truck and pulled out two more of the silvery thermal blankets. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, giving one to Rina for Barker, before heading over to cover Simran.</p><p>Hawke tugged it around the fallen sentry, careful not to jostle her. \u201cThey\u2019re all okay.\u201d The wolf in his eyes, in his voice.</p><p>Never had she been more aware of the fierce strength of his love for his pack. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered, though it hadn\u2019t been a question. \u201cI think Elias is going to end up the worst off\u2014at least, until Lara can get to him.\u201d Sienna wasn\u2019t sure if Judd could heal burns using his Tk-Cell abilities, even if he had the strength after helping Riordan. \u201cWe can keep him sedated till then.\u201d</p><p>Tucking in the edge of the blanket under Simran\u2019s feet, she looked around, thought back to the supplies she\u2019d hauled for Lara. \u201cI think there are energy drinks in one of the boxes. I\u2019ll get some into everyone who\u2019s conscious.\u201d Healers and injured both needed to keep up their strength, especially given the chill night air.</p><p>SO calm, so efficient, Hawke thought, watching Sienna move with grace and speed across the clearing as she bullied and cajoled the drinks into the others. His wolf felt more than a lick of pride, but it was focused on far more painful matters. \u201cLara?\u201d he asked when the healer drew back from Riordan.</p><p>The answer was instant. \u201cYes, more.\u201d</p><p>A single instinctive thought and the strength of his men and women flowed into him through the alpha-lieutenant blood bonds. Indigo\u2019s incredible heart, Riley\u2019s solid loyalty, Matthias\u2019s quiet determination, Riaz\u2019s intensity, Alexei\u2019s barely tempered power, Cooper\u2019s stubborn tenacity, Jem\u2019s wildfire, Kenji\u2019s calm will, Tom\u00e1s\u2019s energetic wildness. The only thing missing tonight was Judd\u2019s cool touch\u2014the Psy male was focused on healing the last of Riordan\u2019s injury as Lara staggered over to Elias.</p><p>Funneling that power to Lara\u2019s form through the bond that every alpha had with his healer, he watched color spill into her cheeks . . . then drain away as she ran her hands over Eli\u2019s ravaged flesh. She cried no tears. Never did Lara cry\u2014not until her people were safe. Only then would she collapse.</p> <p>Dark rubies glimmered in the light of the field lamps as Sienna ran to meet the truck that had just arrived, helping to snap out the field stretchers. She, too, he thought, wouldn\u2019t break down here, on this bloody spread of ground. Not Sienna. Not the woman who\u2019d survived a Councilor, survived the brutal demands of her own savage gift . . . and almost won a game played against an alpha wolf.</p><p>HAVING taken a bare few minutes to shower to wash off Simran\u2019s blood after Lara pronounced that there was no more healing to be done, Hawke returned to the infirmary. \u201cTell me,\u201d he said to Lara, aware of Sienna moving between patient rooms, keeping an eye on things\u2014the healer had ordered both Lucy and Judd to bed as soon as everyone was stable.</p><p>\u201cRiordan and Simran should pull through okay,\u201d Lara said, raising a hand to the wild energy of her curls. Her fingers trembled for a second before she fisted her hand, dropped it to her side. \u201cI heard from Tammy\u2014Barker will be fine, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEli,\u201d he asked, conscious she hadn\u2019t mentioned the senior soldier. \u201cI know you have to heal burns in small steps. How bad is it?\u201d</p><p>Lara\u2019s eyes drifted to the room where Elias lay under a curved panel that covered his body from neck to toe. \u201cI\u2019ve taken care of the life-threatening damage, but he had to wait so long his body went into shock. I won\u2019t be sure of anything until he wakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did everything you could,\u201d Hawke said, knowing the words wouldn\u2019t be enough, not for a healer. About to ask her to go into the office so they could talk privately\u2014so she could drop her stoic front for a therapeutic minute\u2014he saw someone unexpected walk out of Elias\u2019s room.</p><p>Yuki flew into the infirmary at the same instant, stopping only long enough to whisper, \u201cThank you, Walker,\u201d and brush her hand over the Psy male\u2019s, before she entered the room where Elias lay unconscious.</p><p>Hawke knew Yuki had left to check that Sakura was fine with her grandparents, hadn\u2019t realized Walker had stepped in to sit with the fallen soldier, though now that he thought about it, it wasn\u2019t a surprise. He\u2019d seen Elias and Walker talking more than once, noticed their girls playing together, realized that the two must have formed a friendship.</p><p>\u201cEli\u2019s got Yuki watching over him,\u201d Walker said to Lara, his intent gaze taking in the shadows under her eyes, the lines around her mouth. \u201cThe other injured are in a medicated sleep. You can\u2019t do anything until they wake. Rest.\u201d</p><p>Lara\u2019s lips thinned. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Folding her arms, she turned back to Hawke. \u201cI\u2019ll monitor them through the rest of the night\u2014I need to make sure we didn\u2019t miss any hidden damage.\u201d</p><p>Hawke waited to see what Walker would do.</p><p>The other man folded his own arms and said, \u201cHawke, notice how she\u2019s wavering on her feet?\u201d in the most reasonable of tones.</p><p>Lara\u2019s eyes flashed fire, but Hawke had to agree. \u201cTake an hour\u2014I\u2019ll keep an eye on everyone,\u201d he ordered, tugging her into an embrace and nuzzling a kiss into her hair. \u201cDon\u2019t be ornery just to piss Walker off.\u201d His wolf didn\u2019t know what was going on between the two, but there was no mistaking the tension.</p><p>A scowl marred those fine features. \u201cOrnery?\u201d But she softened in his embrace. \u201cA rest does sound good. Wake me the instant anything changes.\u201d</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t miss the way Walker watched them. Neither did he miss the fact that the tall Psy male followed Lara to her office, where she kept a sofa. Moving out of hearing range, he checked in on the injured, found Sienna sitting at Riordan\u2019s bedside, her hand on his. \u201cHis mom started to cry so his dad took her out for a few minutes,\u201d she said in a subvocal murmur, her eyes devoid of stars. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want him to hear it in his sleep.\u201d</p><p>He waited with her until Riordan\u2019s parents returned. The couple allowed his wolf to give comfort to theirs, but he knew nothing would truly soothe them until their child woke. Leaving them with their hands touching Riordan\u2019s skin in silent support, he intertwined his own fingers with Sienna\u2019s.</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>LARA FELT THE back of her neck prickle with awareness as the door shut with a quiet snick. Conscious her tiredness could undermine her resolve where Walker was concerned, she bought time by shrugging off the sweatshirt she\u2019d pulled on over a faded pair of jeans after a two-minute shower to wash off the blood. Her wolf had been unhappy to leave the injured for even that long, but the doctor in her knew the value of cleanliness in a medical surrounding.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d she said at last. \u201cI know we\u2019re friends\u201d\u2014it physically hurt to say that in spite of the fact that she\u2019d made the decision to accept the friendship, continue on with her life in every other way\u2014\u201cbut I really would prefer to be alone.\u201d A painful lie. She was a healer, a wolf. She loved being around her pack. But more, she needed to be around her man. Unfortunately, the man both woman and wolf had chosen was unable to give her what she needed\u2014Silence and a stranger named Yelene had ruined the finest man Lara had ever known . . . and it appeared the damage was irreversible.</p><p>Sinking down on the sofa with that truth weighing down her already heavy heart, she bent to unlace her boots.</p><p>Dark blond hair threaded with the barest glimmer of silver filled her vision as Walker knelt to do the task. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she whispered, her defenses shattered by the events of the night, until she could no longer hide the ache in her soul, the empty space where he should\u2019ve been. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He ignored her to undo the laces and remove her boots with quick, steady hands before tugging off her socks. She gave up trying to stop him, gave up trying to fight the need tearing her apart, and simply indulged in the sight of those strong shoulders below her, the fabric stretched taut over solid muscle.</p><p>A teacher, that\u2019s what everyone said he\u2019d been in the PsyNet. But Lara had always wondered if there was more to it\u2014there was something about Walker that spoke of shadows, of hidden truths. Things she knew he\u2019d never share. Not Walker.</p><p>\u201cSleep.\u201d A single deep word as he rose and picked up the blanket from where it had fallen off the couch.</p> <p>Surrendering both to exhaustion and to his indomitable will, she laid down her head and closed her eyes. She felt the blanket being unfurled over her, felt his fingers push rebellious curls off her face with a tenderness that made her throat lock, but she didn\u2019t open her eyes. For this single, shimmering moment, she\u2019d indulge in a fantasy in which Walker wasn\u2019t broken. Tomorrow would come soon enough.</p><p>ONCE in the break room, Hawke grabbed a seat at the small table and pulled Sienna into his lap. She turned stiff. \u201cWhat are you doing? Anyone could walk in.\u201d</p><p>His wolf peeled back its lips, a low growl rumbling in his chest. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m planning to hide this, hide us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Yet the edgy distance remained.</p><p>Neither part of him liked it. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen me holding packmates.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever me.\u201d The absolute lack of emotion in that simple statement killed him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed, stroking his hand over the dark beauty of the hair. \u201cLet me hold you tonight.\u201d</p><p>It took time for her to soften, to curve her hand over his shoulder, settle her head against him. And he knew\u2014because he knew her\u2014that that would be all she\u2019d give him unless he pushed. Sienna was used not only to keeping secrets, but to fighting her battles alone. No more.</p><p>One arm around her shoulders, the hand of the other on the sleek muscle of her thigh, he said, \u201cEli\u2019s injuries got to you.\u201d He\u2019d been focused on Simran, but his wolf had sensed Sienna arrive, had him glancing up to see her eyes turn to midnight when they landed on the injured soldier.</p><p>There were no words from her, not for a long time. When they did come, they were brittle shards. \u201cI could do that. I have done that . . . and worse.\u201d Sienna said, not knowing why she was admitting to the true horror of her nature. \u201cNo one knows.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s hand stilled on her thigh for a fraction of an instant before he began to pet her again with those small, slow movements. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d kept the secret for so long, not wanting anyone to see her as a monster, but tonight, she knew that to be a false hope. She was a monster. That could not be changed. \u201cWhen I was five years old,\u201d she said, her mind acrid with memory\u2014the lash of cold fire, the agonizing sound of a high pitched scream, the nauseating scent of burned flesh and melted plas as the datapad fused into the soft flesh of a hand that had only ever touched her in gentleness, \u201cI set my mother on fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, baby.\u201d The tenderness in his voice almost broke her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how it happens with the lucky ones,\u201d she said, the piercing echo of her mother\u2019s screams something she would never forget. \u201cThe unlucky ones immolate themselves the first time the X-marker kicks in.\u201d Unlike with the majority of other designations, it was near impossible to identify an X while the ability lay dormant.</p><p>\u201cI know your mother survived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, she was a powerful telepath.\u201d Sienna\u2019s shields had been basic at that stage, with her mother providing the necessary psychic protections. As a result, Kristine had had full access to her mind. \u201cAfter the first shock, she did the only thing she could and knocked me unconscious.\u201d The medics had been able to repair all but the damage done by the datapad. Kristine had carried a fused patch of skin and plas on her palm until the day she died\u2014and never once had she blamed Sienna for it.</p><p>Hawke settled her deeper against him, the hand that had been on her thigh moving up to cup her face. The guilt inside of her made her want to avoid his gaze, duck her head, but she\u2019d never before done that with him, recognizing instinctively that to bow down in such a way was to signal something to his wolf that she did not want. \u201cThat was when Ming came,\u201d she said, meeting those wolf-blue eyes though shame curdled her stomach. \u201cHe wanted to cut me off from my family at once, except that my mother had been unconsciously subduing my urges since birth.\u201d</p><p>No judgment on his face, nothing but an intense concentration. \u201cIs that normal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way. Psy children often don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing with their abilities, so most parents keep a psychic eye on them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe same way adult changelings make sure pups don\u2019t claw each other by accident.\u201d</p><p>His words, the attempt to find common ground between them, thawed a little of the frozen lump in her chest. \u201cYes. But my mother, she was a cardinal telepath, very, very strong\u2014she didn\u2019t realize just how much power she\u2019d been utilizing to block me. If she\u2019d been weaker . . .\u201d She shook her head, the chill returning to infuse her very bones. \u201cI would\u2019ve killed either myself or another child much earlier.\u201d</p><p>Hawke sensed the gut-deep pain behind the calm, almost flat words. Five years old. A baby, and she\u2019d been in Ming\u2019s care. \u201cYour mother went with you?\u201d</p><p>A nod. \u201cI didn\u2019t know then, I didn\u2019t realize, but my mother was different. Most women would\u2019ve handed me over to Ming and released themselves of all liability, but even after he was able to take over what she\u2019d been doing to help me on the psychic plane, she refused to sign away her rights as my mother.\u201d Gleaming pride melded with a furious depth of tenderness.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d Sienna continued, \u201cshe couldn\u2019t teach me control. She was a communications specialist, not gifted in mental combat like Ming. It took him four months to safely isolate and contain me behind his own telepathic shields. Then he taught me. It was hard.\u201d</p><p>Such a simple statement. Such a terrible statement. \u201cI hate Ming for what he did\u201d\u2014because that isolation, that containment, Hawke understood it had been a prison cell around the mind of a scared child\u2014\u201cbut he helped you stay alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sienna disagreed, \u201che helped me become Silent. Most Psy graduate the Protocol at sixteen. I was Silent by age nine. Sometimes, I think that\u2019s why my mother decided to have Toby\u2014because she knew I was gone from the instant Ming walked into our home.\u201d</p><p>And yet, Hawke thought, Sienna had never lost her soul. She\u2019d retained the capacity to love Toby with a fierceness that was wolf in its strength, retained the loyalty to family that had seen her defect to save the children\u2019s lives. It staggered him to realize the incredible will she must\u2019ve had even as a child that she\u2019d been able to hide and protect that part of her psyche from a Councilor.</p><p>About to speak of the depth of his pride in her, to tell her she had no reason to carry any shame, he heard a slight sound. \u201cI think Simran is up.\u201d</p><p>Sienna flowed off his lap, concern replacing the heavy darkness that had fallen over her face as she spoke of her mockery of a childhood. \u201cShould I fetch Lara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, let me check first. But why don\u2019t you look in on the others?\u201d</p><p>When he walked into Simran\u2019s room, it was to find the injured sentry smiling weakly at the woman who sat by her side, a lanky soldier so fleet of foot that Hawke often used her as a messenger across den territory. \u201cIn\u00e9s,\u201d he said, running the back of his hand over her cheek. \u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen minutes ago.\u201d Her body trembled as she leaned in to rest her head against his side. \u201cSimran won\u2019t tell me how badly she was hurt.\u201d</p><p>Simran said, \u201cNo need,\u201d her throat husky.</p><p>Making a hushing sound, In\u00e9s reached for the bottle of water on the bedside table. \u201cI\u2019m talking to my alpha, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d The words were chiding, the tone affectionate as she put a straw into the bottle so the wounded sentry could take a sip.</p><p>Hawke pressed his lips to In\u00e9s\u2019s temple when she put down the bottle. \u201cIt was bad,\u201d he said, ignoring Simran\u2019s scowl, \u201cbut I had her and I wasn\u2019t letting go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re a stubborn bastard.\u201d In\u00e9s\u2019s thin arms hugged him tight before she leaned over to brush the hair off Simran\u2019s face with fingers that were exquisitely tender.</p><p>Riordan, when Hawke glanced into the novice soldier\u2019s room, remained in a sedated sleep, but Elias had regained consciousness, his hand on his mate\u2019s head as she pressed it to his uninjured side. Thank God. Figuring Lara would forgive him for not waking her up since it was good news, he was about to leave the couple in privacy when Sienna brushed past him and into the room. \u201cHere,\u201d she said, putting a warmed-up cup of soup in Yuki\u2019s hand. \u201cDrink it or you know he\u2019ll keep fussing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t fuss.\u201d Rasped-out words. \u201cNow drink it.\u201d</p><p>Deep shadows lingered beneath the liquid dark of Yuki\u2019s expressive eyes, the lids swollen and red, as was the tip of her nose, but there was no lack of energy in the face she made at her mate. \u201cBossy man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d A smile so intimate, it felt wrong to witness it. \u201cFor the next century, at least.\u201d</p><p>Lara appeared in the doorway beside Hawke right then, her cheek bearing marks of sleep. \u201cWhat\u2019s the ruckus?\u201d she asked with a beaming smile before shooing both Hawke and Sienna away. \u201cGet rested in case I need you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Seeing that Walker had returned to the infirmary, Hawke acquiesced. \u201cI want to grab some fresh air,\u201d he said to Sienna.</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until they were outside, with her leaning up against a gentle knoll in the White Zone, that she said, \u201cIt must be nice, don\u2019t you think?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He braced one arm on the grassy surface beside her head, his wolf strangely content in spite of the skin hunger that continued to be a constant ache at the back of his mind. \u201cWhat?\u201d Twining a strand of her hair around his finger, he rubbed it between fingertip and thumb.</p><p>\u201cTo have a hundred years with someone.\u201d Her voice held such haunted need it shook him. \u201cI never imagined that was possible before I came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost folks live at least three decades beyond a hundred,\u201d Hawke said, stepping close enough that one of his thighs brushed hers, \u201cso it\u2019s not unusual.\u201d</p> <p>Sienna didn\u2019t pull away, the scent of her an unintended caress across his senses. \u201cBut together . . . imagine how deeply you\u2019d know someone after all that time, how very complex the love would be between the two of you.\u201d</p><p>It was time, he thought, to lay things out into the open. \u201cNo hypotheticals, Sienna. Me and you. Is that what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve made that pretty clear.\u201d An acerbic reply accompanied by arms folded across her chest.</p><p>His wolf liked the bite of her, but he had to be certain she understood the implications of being with him. All of them. Fisting a hand into her hair, he pressed in close until she had to unfold her arms, her hands landing on his waist. \u201cDo you know what it would mean for you if I take you as mine?\u201d</p><p>Though her pulse was a frantic beat he wanted to lick, she stood her ground.</p> <p>\u201cNo matter what, I can\u2019t give you the mati\u2014\u201d he began, because he would not lie to her.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she interrupted. \u201cI heard . . . I put things together.\u201d</p><p>Of course she had, his smart Psy. But that wasn\u2019t the only thing he had to say. \u201cNo more flirtations with boys your own age,\u201d he said, gripping that stubborn jaw with his fingers. \u201cNo more dancing with any male but me. No more time to learn who you are before you have to hold that personality against mine. No more freedom to explore your sensuality before I own it.\u201d</p><p>Right at that moment, face-to-face with the dominant force of his personality, Sienna realized exactly how much Hawke had been holding back, and part of her hesitated. The fact was, while she was intelligent and off the charts when it came to psychic strength, she had no true knowledge of how to deal with males . . . no, with this male. He was the only one who\u2019d sliced through her every shield to impact the very core of her, the part she\u2019d protected with single-minded determination even as the rest of her turned Silent.</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d Hawke\u2019s smile held no humor. \u201cYou should be, baby.\u201d Then he kissed her, and it was no tender exploration, no playful tease. This was the kiss of a man who knew precisely what he wanted and had no compunctions about getting it. Using his grip on her jaw to angle her how he wanted, he nipped at her lower lip hard enough that she gasped, opened her mouth.</p><p>Making a deep sound low in his throat, he swept in, tasting her with a proprietary thoroughness that caused a tremor to shiver through her frame. Instead of easing up on the kiss, he pressed deeper into her, letting her feel every hard inch of him as he licked and tasted and demanded. Never had she realized how soft her body was in comparison to his, how much hotter he burned.</p> <p>It was a lesson, and when it was over, she had kiss-swollen lips, a body so sensitized to his touch that it burned a craving across every inch of her . . . and a sudden awareness that maybe, just maybe, she hadn\u2019t thought this out as well as she\u2019d believed.</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>THE GHOST THOUGHT of the uses he could make of a cardinal X, fully cognizant that he was more than capable of double-crossing Judd. Except for one thing\u2014his reason for building the fires of rebellion, for not executing the entire Council in a bloody burst of violence, it held him back, acting as the conscience he didn\u2019t have.</p><p>As a result, instead of spending his time strategizing about how to gain control of the rogue X, he dove into the slipstream of the Net, the psychic network created by the minds of millions of Psy across the world, each mind an icy white star on an endless spread of black. The Net existed in every place on the earth, a vast sprawl that had no limits.</p><p>In this infinite system ran rivers of data, millions and trillions of pieces of information uploaded each and every day by the minds hooked into the network. It was the biggest data archive on the planet, the storehouse of knowledge for their entire race. The unwary could get buried under the weight of it, but the Ghost was a shark gliding through the slipstream in lethal silence, filtering data with a speed and specificity that was almost preternatural.</p><p>Rumors, whispers, conspiracy theories centered around the time and manner of Alice Eldridge\u2019s death, all of it floated to the top of his consciousness as the Net gave up its secrets. None held anything of substance. Either the Arrows had done an immaculate job of wiping Eldridge from the Net, or the data had degraded in the years since her death.</p><p>That left him with the Obsidian archive. Created by the NetMind, the neosentience that was the guardian and librarian of the Net, the Obsidian archive was a backup in case the PsyNet ever suffered a catastrophic failure. The Ghost had named it Obsidian because the complexity of data within it made it all but a wall of black. Only a rare few individuals had ever realized the Obsidian archive existed.</p><p>Even fewer knew how to access it.</p> <p>If there was anything to find on Alice Eldridge\u2019s second manuscript, it would be buried in that immense hoard of information. Otherwise, Sienna Lauren was on her own.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>SIENNA CAUGHT HAWKE as he was heading out of the den early the next afternoon. \u201cWait.\u201d The tense line of her spine told him she\u2019d forgotten nothing from the previous night.</p><p>Neither had he. \u201cTalk fast, baby.\u201d It came out curt. Yes, he\u2019d meant to scare her, but to be honest, he hadn\u2019t expected it to work. That it had had irritated his wolf. \u201cI\u2019ve got a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s to do with the attack, you need to hear this.\u201d She walked at a rapid clip beside him as he continued on outside, where he\u2019d left a vehicle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat they did, it\u2019s a tactic Ming used to talk about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA quick hit designed to hurt the pack\u2019s morale.\u201d The death of five changelings would\u2019ve been considered a bonus. \u201cI guessed that.\u201d His fury was a cold thing, his wolf thinking with clear-eyed precision.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s more.\u201d She almost ran as he lengthened his stride. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a war of attrition. They\u2019re not going to come at you full force until they\u2019ve whittled down your numbers through surgical strikes. Because you don\u2019t have an obvious target against which to retaliate, you\u2019ll splinter your forces in an effort to keep up, further fragmenting your strength.\u201d</p><p>Catching the assurance in her voice, he came to a stop. \u201cYou sound certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d There was nothing of reserve in her now, only steely eyed conviction. \u201cThe fact that whoever was behind this used a stealthcraft rather than telekinetics, when they know changelings have superior senses and might well detect a physical intrusion, tells me their Tks were doing something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re assuming they have telekinetics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone with enough power to mount that kind of op has the pull to have a unit of Tks under his or her command.\u201d She put her hands on her hips. \u201cI want to borrow Brenna for a couple of hours, have her bring up satellite images of certain areas.\u201d</p><p>She was a novice soldier, didn\u2019t have the rank to make such a bold demand\u2014but she\u2019d also been the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of a Psy most considered the Council\u2019s military mastermind. \u201cHow do you plan to figure out where to look?\u201d he asked instead of dismissing the request outright.</p><p>She tapped her temple. \u201cMing was, and probably still is, the best of the best when it comes to martial strategy. No matter who\u2019s running this, I can outthink them if I think like him.\u201d</p><p>He took an instant to weigh the variables, almost able to see the impatience flashing in her eyes. That was his girl, he thought, hiding his grin. \u201cYou can have Brenna\u2014for half an hour,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s got too many other things on her plate.\u201d</p><p>Lines formed between her eyebrows but she nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll narrow things down as much as possible before I go to her\u2014that\u2019ll make it more efficient.\u201d</p><p>An hour and a half later, he could still see the white-hot rays of the Sierra sun glinting off the red in her hair as she turned to jog back to the den. The woman in front of him was an altogether different creature, had no fire in her soul. Nikita Duncan had given birth to an empath, then thrown her away. She was as cold as her daughter was full of heart. Even in looks alone, they were poles apart.</p><p>Nikita had cool white skin, eyes from Japan, and cutting cheekbones that complemented the razor-straight jet of her hair. Sascha\u2019s skin was colored a warm brown, her hair a curling tumble of soft black, her face softer, more rounded. Both unquestionably beautiful women. Except one had the blood of a reptile, while the other would spill her own to save a stranger.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Sascha darling?\u201d he murmured under his breath as Nikita turned to say something to the other Councilor at the table, the enigmatic Anthony Kyriakus\u2014tall, patrician, his black hair silvered at the temples.</p><p>Sascha made a rueful face from his left. \u201cAbout to give birth. That\u2019s what it feels like, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Her muttered words made him grin, but he could see that Lucas wasn\u2019t amused. He wondered how big of a fight the two had had today about Sascha\u2019s attendance at this meeting\u2014not that Lucas would\u2019ve taken any chances with really riling her up now that she was so close to her due date. If Hawke had to guess, he\u2019d say the leopard alpha had bitten his tongue even as his animal went insane at the idea of his pregnant mate so close to those who might cause her harm. And for once, Sascha, the empath, seemed clueless.</p><p>Moving his lips to her ear, he murmured, \u201cSweetheart, you know I love you, but you need to get Luc away from here before he loses his mind.\u201d</p><p>Sascha froze, stared. Her eyes turned midnight within one blink and the next. \u201cOh dear,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHow did I miss that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cProbably because you\u2019re nine and a half months pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes at him, she leaned over and pecked him on the cheek.</p><p>Lucas\u2019s growl was audible.</p> <p>\u201cLucas,\u201d Sascha said at the same moment, \u201cI don\u2019t feel that great.\u201d</p><p>The DarkRiver alpha shoved back his chair and bundled Sascha out of the room so fast that Anthony and Nikita were left staring. Vaughn, having been holding up the wall at their backs, slid into Lucas\u2019s seat with smooth feline grace, while Nathan took the one Sascha had vacated. Across from them, Nikita continued to stare out the door.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not about to give birth,\u201d the Councilor said into the silence a second later, and Hawke realized she\u2019d been telepathing her daughter.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>\u201cHow close is she?\u201d Max Shannon asked as he walked in. \u201cSorry I\u2019m late\u2014got caught up in traffic.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your J, cop?\u201d Vaughn asked instead of answering the question.</p><p>\u201cOn her way,\u201d Max said, referring to his wife, a former Justice Psy who remained uplinked to the Net in spite of her broken Silence. \u201cShe might have some info for us.\u201d</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t trust anyone hooked into the PsyNet given how deep the Psy Councilors\u2019 tentacles were on the psychic plane, but he had nothing against Max\u2019s J in particular. In fact, he kinda liked her\u2014Sophia carried shadows in her eyes. Shadows meant a life lived, a personality beyond the ice.</p><p>Riley stirred beside him. \u201cDid you both read the report we sent through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Nikita and Anthony answered simultaneously.</p><p>Again, interesting. It made Hawke wonder what other machinations the two were getting up to behind everyone else\u2019s backs.</p> <p>\u201cNeither one of us orchestrated the attack on your people,\u201d Nikita said. \u201cWhether you believe that or not is up to you, but it makes no logical sense for us to weaken this region at present.\u201d</p><p>Meaning that if the other Councilors hadn\u2019t been a threat, Nikita might well have spilled changeling blood. Then again, Hawke thought, considering everything they knew about her, Nikita followed the money\u2014war would be bad for her bottom line. There was also the fact that her security chief was a man with an impeccable code of honor, a man who\u2019d laid his life on the line to protect the innocent.</p><p>As for Anthony, quite aside from the fact that the cats had vouched for him on previous occasions, the man controlled an empire of F-Psy worth billions. No one and nothing could shake him from that position. More to the point, the NightStar Group had always been willing to deal with anyone who could pay the fees demanded for a forecast: human, Psy or changeling.</p><p>Max tapped the table now. \u201cPlus, neither Nikita nor Anthony have the manpower. Simple as that.\u201d It was an admission of weakness, an opening gambit.</p><p>\u201cWho else can you rule out?\u201d Nathan, the most senior of Lucas\u2019s sentinels and a man with a head as calm and clear as Riley\u2019s, leaned forward.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Kaleb,\u201d Nikita said at once. \u201cHe\u2019s distracted by another matter at present.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur information,\u201d Riley inserted, \u201cis that Kaleb has either gained, or is close to gaining, control over the Arrow Squad.\u201d</p><p>A long, careful pause. \u201cYou have excellent sources,\u201d Anthony replied at last. \u201cYes, it does appear the Arrows have shifted their allegiance from Ming to Kaleb\u2014and their priority has always been Silence and the integrity of the Net. The squad disassociated from Ming because he lost sight of that priority. Kaleb is unlikely to repeat the mistake.\u201d</p> <p>That tracked with the information Judd had been able to get from his contacts.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible Tatiana is backing the Scotts,\u201d Nikita added, \u201cbut she\u2019ll have kept enough distance that nothing rebounds back on her. As for Ming, he has spoken against the Scotts in Council and appears to be more focused on internal matters.\u201d</p><p>Hawke entered the conversation. \u201cYou seem certain the Scotts are behind this.\u201d Their own intelligence supported the same conclusion, but he wanted to hear Nikita\u2019s and Anthony\u2019s reasons.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s patent they want total, unopposed control of the Net,\u201d Anthony said, the aristocratic lines of his face without expression but holding a charisma that would\u2019ve made the man a force even without the foreseers under his command. \u201cAside from Kaleb, who is too formidable an adversary to challenge at this stage, Nikita and I are the only ones standing in their way\u2014because we\u2019re acting together and in a region that can defend itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t be able to pin it on them,\u201d Nikita said with a frigid bluntness Hawke was coming to associate with her. \u201cThey\u2019ll have made certain of it.\u201d</p><p>SEVENTY minutes later, Hawke had another discussion, this time with a much tighter group. Him, Riley, Judd, the two DarkRiver sentinels who\u2019d attended the meeting, plus Lucas and Sascha. They met outside the alpha pair\u2019s cabin. Hawke didn\u2019t tease the leopard male today, knowing how on edge he had to be, having his mate so close to those who weren\u2019t Pack. It didn\u2019t matter that the wolves were allies\u2014it was about the animal\u2019s need to protect.</p><p>Frankly, Hawke was surprised Lucas had agreed to the meeting . . . but no, perhaps he wasn\u2019t. Sascha and Lucas had the kind of relationship that every alpha craved, Hawke included. Sascha wasn\u2019t just a lover, wasn\u2019t simply a playmate in the best sense of the world; she was a partner, Lucas\u2019s first port of call when he needed advice.</p><p>It was instinctive to think of Sienna. So young . . . too young.</p><p>Ming was, and probably still is, the best of the best when it comes to martial strategy. No matter who\u2019s running this, I can outthink them if I think like him.</p><p>Frowning at the reminder of exactly how she\u2019d gained that depth of knowledge, he turned to Luc. \u201cWhat\u2019s your gut say?\u201d He knew the alpha had sat in on the meeting via the subtle comm system Vaughn had been wearing.</p><p>\u201cNikita\u2019s right\u2014no way to pin the violence on the Scotts, though everything points to them.\u201d Lucas rubbed at his stubbled jaw. \u201cBut who says we have to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we strike back and hit the wrong target,\u201d Hawke responded, \u201cwe lose the element of surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not my mother,\u201d Sascha said from the cushioned wicker chair positioned against the cabin wall. \u201cNot because she\u2019s my mother, but because I know how she works. If someone was trying to mount a hostile takeover of SnowDancer\u2019s assets, cut you off at the knees in financial terms, I\u2019d be the first to point the finger at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Anthony,\u201d Vaughn said without clarifying. The fact that he was mated to Anthony\u2019s daughter, however, did give the jaguar changeling a high level of credibility. It also made Hawke wonder, not for the first time, about Anthony Kyriakus\u2019s loyalties.</p><p>\u201cI agree with Nikita about Ming and Kaleb Krychek,\u201d Judd said. \u201cMing\u2019s taken a hit with the loss of the Arrows and will still be consolidating his remaining troops. I can say with categorical certainty that the squad won\u2019t have mobilized on this big an operation for Kaleb yet.\u201d</p><p>Riley, pragmatic as always, asked the critical question. \u201cDoes Krychek have access to other operatives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But fact is, he\u2019s a powerful enough telekinetic that he doesn\u2019t need anyone when it comes down to it. This is a man who could cause an earthquake, collapse the entire city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Vaughn said as Lucas whistled. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis abilities are so far off the scale that the Gradient is meaningless.\u201d Judd\u2019s tone was matter-of-fact. \u201cHe\u2019s a master game player, so I won\u2019t discount him totally, but Kaleb\u2019s got two powerful packs in his region, and he\u2019s exhibited no aggression toward either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlackEdge and StoneWater.\u201d Riley nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a line of communication with them, and from what they\u2019ve shared, it looks like Krychek leaves them alone as long as they do the same with him. Doesn\u2019t make sense that he\u2019d come out here to pick a fight with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we take Krychek off the table,\u201d Hawke said, \u201cit leaves us with the same three Anthony and Nikita fingered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go after all three.\u201d Lucas\u2019s tone was hard. \u201cSurgical strikes, same as their hit.\u201d</p><p>Hawke, his mind awash in the blood scent and pain of his fallen, growled in agreement. \u201cIt has to be hard, and it has to be fast.\u201d The enemy had to understand the packs had teeth and no hesitancy about using them.</p><p>\u201cThe Scotts and Tatiana,\u201d Judd said, \u201care all protected behind walls of near-impregnable security. It\u2019s going to be difficult to get close to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot them,\u201d Sascha said, then yawned. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed, and the moment provided some much-needed levity.</p><p>\u201cOkay, what I was saying before I fell asleep\u201d\u2014she leaned against her mate\u2019s thigh, where he stood with his back to the wall by her side\u2014\u201cis that you don\u2019t go after them. You go after something that represents them. Something big and shiny.\u201d</p><p>Judd\u2019s eyes landed on Sascha. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re an empath?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grew up with Nikita for a mother.\u201d</p><p>It was relatively easy to choose a target for Henry Scott\u2014his London residence was in an eminent location and worth millions. The bonus was that Judd had been in and around the place as an Arrow, knew how their people could evade security. Shoshanna Scott also presented little problem. She\u2019d bought a huge office building in Dubai a month ago\u2014currently untenanted, it had minimal security.</p><p>\u201cNo casualties\u2014security guards have to be clear before we strike,\u201d Hawke said, because killing innocents would make them no better than the Councilors. \u201cWe don\u2019t compromise on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Lucas closed his hand over Sascha\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDo you have anyone in London? I know Jamie\u2019s roaming in that area, so we can pull him in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hawke gave a crisp nod. Wolves didn\u2019t go roaming as often as the cats, but given the Council\u2019s increasing aggression, SnowDancer had made a deliberate policy of stationing people in and around the world\u2019s major cities. Riley rotated their more lone-wolf types until the men and women wanted to come home. The latest to return had been Riaz.</p><p>The bulk of their time was spent handling SnowDancer\u2019s international business interests, but they also kept an eye on certain more covert matters, feeding information back to the den. However, every one of those lone wolves was a high-level soldier, more than capable of handling this type of task. \u201cDubai won\u2019t be an issue either.\u201d There was a SnowDancer within easy flight distance.</p><p>Lucas nodded. \u201cThat leaves Tatiana.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a problem,\u201d Judd said. \u201cShe\u2019s bought interests in human companies\u2014we hit any of those, we affect a large number of blameless people.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s cell phone rang at that moment, the code making his wolf come to wild attention. \u201cHold on,\u201d he said to the others and walked a small distance away. \u201cTalk to me, pretty baby.\u201d Yeah, he was having trouble with the boundaries when it came to Sienna, even when he was the one who\u2019d put them into place.</p><p>Brenna\u2019s voice came over the line. \u201cYou sweet talker.\u201d The words were tart.</p><p>His wolf grinned. \u201cPut her on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2014she was just double-checking something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrenna and I were able to pinpoint three incursions made by the Tk team,\u201d Sienna said without any prelude. \u201cFar as we can figure, they were laying charges. Indigo took people to check out the locations, and from the data she sent back, they\u2019re getting smarter. No metal components, hidden deeper to beat your senses, difficult to detect unless you\u2019re right on top of the devices.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf bared its teeth, but his thought process remained icily rational. \u201cGood work, both of you.\u201d Certain Indigo would have the situation under control, he moved to another matter. \u201cSienna, while you were with Ming, did you ever learn about a property or holding on which Tatiana Rika-Smythe places particular importance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a tendency to buy into other companies,\u201d Sienna said, \u201crather than building herself. But . . . wait a second.\u201d</p><p>Brenna came on the line. \u201cYour pretty baby is running a search.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart-ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m casually walking over to where she can\u2019t hear us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo ask you if you\u2019re courting her properly. Really, Hawke, a girl deserves flowers at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do flowers.\u201d And right now, the whole courtship thing was in the air. As last night had shown with inescapable clarity, she was nowhere near ready to handle the truth of him. The thought had his hand clenching on the phone.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard,\u201d Brenna muttered. \u201cCall up a florist, buy a bouquet.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf liked her too much to be annoyed. \u201cLet me talk to her, brat. I have to get back to my meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a second. First\u2014how\u2019s my pretty baby?\u201d</p><p>Hawke glanced over to see Judd listening to something Vaughn was saying, his head angled toward the ground, a frown on his face. Unusual for the former assassin. \u201cFlirting with a jaguar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not funny, mister,\u201d Brenna said before the phone passed hands and Sienna came back on the line.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to confirm this,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it looks like Tatiana is still the sole owner of a sculpture that stands in the middle of a small park in Cambridge, England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sculpture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Ming found that odd, too, so he had me research it as part of my training. It was commissioned by a Smythe a hundred years ago, after the deal that led to their fortune. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the kind of thing you\u2019re looking for . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might even kiss you for it. All over.\u201d Hanging up to her sucked-in breath, he walked back to the others. \u201cI have a target for Tatiana.\u201d As for Sienna, he\u2019d give her a bit more time, but . . . he was a wolf. Who the hell said he had to play it civilized? She was his. She would learn to deal with him.</p><p>RECOVERED FROM COMPUTER 2(A) TAGS: PERSONAL CORRESPONDENCE, FATHER, ACTION REQUIRED AND COMPLETED3</p><p>FROM: Alice &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>TO: Dad &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>DATE: April 14th, 1973 at 10:32pm</p><p>SUBJECT: re: re: re: hello</p><p>Hi Dad,</p><p>Yes, my last e-mail did make no sense.

Healing. I have to wait for his body to recover from this session before I can carry on. He\u2019ll be here for a while yet.\u201d</p><p>Seeing Lucy examining the readout on the panel in Riordan\u2019s room, he held out his hand. \u201cCome with me, Lara. You need to have a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He took her hand, halting her words midstream. \u201cEither you walk out with me,\u201d he said, keeping his tone calm though his words were nothing reasonable, \u201cor I\u2019ll take a leaf out of Hawke\u2019s book and carry you out.\u201d That situation, too, was something he had his eye on, but it wasn\u2019t time for him to say his piece. Not yet.</p><p>Lara\u2019s mouth fell open. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He waited, let her eyes scan his face, see the truth.</p><p>Cheeks flushing a dull red beneath that deep tan skin, she said, \u201cYou would.\u201d A small tug as she tried to free her hand, failed. \u201cI need to tell Lucy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s seen.\u201d Then he began walking, pulling Lara along.</p><p>She made a small growling sound he\u2019d never before heard from her. \u201cI\u2019m a wolf, not a dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d treat a pet better than you treat yourself.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them said another word until they were some distance from the den, beside a waterfall that froze in the winter months but was at present a roaring spray.</p><p>Releasing his grip on her, he pointed to a rocky ledge. \u201cSit before you fall down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgh!\u201d She slammed fisted hands against his chest. \u201cWould you like me to shift and wag my tail while I\u2019m at it?\u201d Anger turned her tawny eyes dark, thinned the soft invitation of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, grabbing her wrists, her bones delicate under his touch. \u201cI\u2019d like you to permit me to take care of you.\u201d It was a raw craving, this need he had to ensure she wasn\u2019t hurting herself. He didn\u2019t understand it, had never felt its like.</p><p>Lara shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t do this.\u201d Breath hitching, she pushed against him. \u201cYou can be my friend, Walker. But you don\u2019t have any other rights\u2014you didn\u2019t want them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLara,\u201d he began, continuing to maintain his grip, but she shook her head again.</p><p>\u201cYou were honest with me, so I\u2019ll be honest with you. The kind of rights you want, the kind you\u2019re trying to claim? They\u2019re intimate rights.\u201d Wet shimmered in the expressive depths of her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t give them to you. They belong to the man with whom I\u2019ll build a life, have children.\u201d</p><p>This time, when she pulled, he released her wrists, watched her leave.</p><p>The spray of the waterfall was cold on his skin.</p><p>THE day after running the surveillance search, Sienna found herself with time on her hands. Aware Hawke was busy organizing something with DarkRiver, she decided that rather than give in to her frustration at being shut out because of her rank, she\u2019d make productive use of her time to go speak with Sascha.</p><p>When she moved out of the woods near the cabin, it was to see the empath walking back and forth in front of the home she shared with Lucas. \u201cThanks for agreeing to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d A hand cupping her cheek for a warm moment. \u201cYou know you\u2019re always welcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Lucas?\u201d It was a given that he wouldn\u2019t be far with Sascha now only days from her due date.</p><p>Sascha lifted a finger to her lips, then pointed up. Following the cardinal\u2019s gaze, Sascha found a black panther draped in graceful sleep over one of the thick branches that supported the aerie the couple planned to move back into after Sascha recovered from the birth.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Sienna whispered, having never before seen Lucas in animal form. \u201cHe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>The cat\u2019s tail waved lazily.</p><p>Sascha laughed. \u201cHe heard you\u2014he\u2019s just dozing. Stayed up rubbing my back most of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you be sitting down?\u201d</p><p>A black scowl. \u201cSienna, don\u2019t make me deck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know much about pregnancy aside from the facts, or what I\u2019ve learned from being around you,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there while my mother was pregnant with Toby.\u201d No, she\u2019d been trapped in a telepathic prison created by a master of mental combat. Awful as that had been, she wouldn\u2019t change it\u2014because Ming had trained her in his own image, taught her the skills to fight those who would hurt her brother, her family, her pack . . . her man.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re in the same boat.\u201d One hand bracing her back, Sascha reached over to tuck Sienna\u2019s hair behind her ear. \u201cYou wanted to talk, kitten?\u201d</p><p>Sienna looked up at Lucas, dropped her voice. \u201cCan he hear us if we keep the volume low?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. He\u2019s got bat hearing these days.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The panther made a low grumbling sound but didn\u2019t leave his branch.</p><p>Much as she respected the leopard alpha, Sienna wasn\u2019t sure she was comfortable discussing this particular topic with him in hearing range. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You need to relax anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking to you is hardly a strain.\u201d A chiding look. \u201cLuc will be a Sphinx, won\u2019t you, pussycat?\u201d Her mate\u2019s responding rumble made Sascha smile. \u201cHe\u2019s feeling very grumpy this afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>Needing answers, Sienna decided to ask her questions and trust in Lucas\u2019s discretion. \u201cWith Hawke,\u201d she said, walking with Sascha as the empath continued her easy pacing, \u201cI . . . something happened.\u201d Though it was in her nature to be private, she shared the gist of what had taken place between them the night of the attack. \u201cHe\u2019s been busy since then, but even when we\u2019ve run into each other, he hasn\u2019t made a single move\u2014it\u2019s like his wolf is watching, but for what, I\u2019m not certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Sascha rubbed at her belly, her head cocked at a listening angle. \u201cOh, well, yes.\u201d</p><p>Sienna looked from the empath to her mate. \u201cYou have a telepathic bond?\u201d Extraordinary.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s grown exponentially during the pregnancy.\u201d Digging the heel of one hand into her back while cradling her abdomen with the other, she blew out a breath. \u201cI think Lucas is right\u2014he says Hawke is waiting for you to go to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the kind of man who waits.\u201d If Sienna knew one thing, it was that immutable fact, which was why his sudden watchful distance had left her so at sea. \u201cSascha,\u201d she said, noticing the wince on the empath\u2019s face, \u201cyour back\u2019s hurting you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be worse if I sit.\u201d Waving off Sienna\u2019s gesture toward the wicker outdoor furniture, Sascha continued to walk. \u201cThe thing is, Hawke needs to know you\u2019re making a conscious choice to be with him, even understanding that it\u2019s not going to be an easy road\u2014though I have no doubt his patience will be shoved aside by his arrogance very soon and you\u2019ll find yourself hunted.\u201d</p><p>The black panther jumped down from his branch to stand against Sascha\u2019s side as she completed that dry statement. Smile curving her lips, the empath stroked her hand over that proud head. \u201cThere\u2019s also\u2014\u201d A startled cry, liquid gushing down her legs.</p><p>And Lucas was shifting in wild sparks of color. \u201cSascha, did your water just break?\u201d Stunned leopard-green eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been having small contractions since the middle of last night,\u201d Sascha admitted, chest heaving. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to call Tamsyn too early.\u201d</p><p>Rising without another word, Lucas gathered his mate into his arms, carrying her with no evidence of strain. \u201cSienna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d Grateful she had the DarkRiver healer\u2019s code on her cell phone, she stabbed at the touchpad of her phone, missed. Tried again.</p> <p>Tamsyn\u2019s calm response settled her own frantic heart. \u201cI want you to go in,\u201d the healer said, \u201ctime her contractions, keep me updated. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>Sienna nodded, then realized Tamsyn couldn\u2019t see her. \u201cYes, yes, of course.\u201d She was a cardinal X and a SnowDancer soldier. She could time contractions. Sascha was having her baby!</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in less than ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Heading inside, Sienna knocked on the bedroom door before entering. Lucas had pulled on a pair of sweatpants and sat behind Sascha on the bed, one hand tangled with hers, the other petting her abdomen with soothing strokes. \u201cHow long till Tammy arrives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>Sascha blinked. \u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m an idiot?\u201d Lucas\u2019s voice was a growl, his touch unbearably tender. \u201cI knew you were having contractions, stubborn woman.\u201d</p><p>Sascha laughed, then winced. \u201cOh, here we go again.\u201d</p> <p>Sienna started timing.</p><p>SASCHA felt another contraction building as Tammy walked in through the door, a competent, unruffled presence. \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you.\u201d She\u2019d been so sure she\u2019d timed it right, except her own body had decided to reschedule things.</p><p>\u201cI was never far away,\u201d the healer said with a smile as she checked the progress of the labor, her touch gentle and capable. \u201cSienna\u2019s in the kitchen with Nate. She\u2019s putting together food for the people she knows are going to start dropping by any minute\u2014that girl is terrifyingly efficient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought,\u201d Sascha said, clutching at the topic to keep her mind off the rippling waves of pain, \u201cshe was going to pass out when my water broke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, that was me,\u201d Lucas growled next to her ear. \u201cNow, remember, don\u2019t try any more shit\u2014do it like we practiced. Funnel the pain through the mating bond and into me.\u201d</p><p>It went against everything in Sascha\u2019s nature to cause him pain, but she knew he\u2019d never forgive her if she didn\u2019t allow him to help her through this. \u201cYou have a terrible bedside manner.\u201d</p><p>A nip on her ear. \u201cThis is my first time.\u201d</p><p>Her heart bloomed. \u201cMe, too.\u201d Gripping his hand as her abdomen rippled, she diverted the pain along the mating bond to the panther who held her so tight, so close.</p><p>His body jerked before he hissed out a breath. \u201cJesus H. Christ. I have new respect for the female of the species suddenly.\u201d</p><p>Tamsyn snorted. \u201cYou ain\u2019t seen nothing yet, buckaroo.\u201d Glancing at Sascha, she added, \u201cI think it\u2019ll help if you walk around for a while. Nate will keep everyone from the back of the house if you want to go out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, okay.\u201d The next several hours were the most scary\u2014and most wonderful\u2014of Sascha\u2019s life. Exhausted, her hair sticking to the side of her face, she clung to Lucas\u2019s hand and rode out the contractions as they got progressively longer and closer together, until she couldn\u2019t stay on her feet. He took most of the pain, her panther, but her muscles ached, so many strands of jelly in her body. \u201cOh dear,\u201d she said toward the end of the third hour.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Tammy and Lucas asked at once, acute concern in their voices.</p><p>\u201cThe baby\u2019s decided it wants to stay right where it is.\u201d Sascha could feel its anger at the current circumstances clear as day. \u201cIt is not impressed by all this squeezing and jostling about and could we please stop.\u201d</p><p>Tamsyn\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cWow, everyone knows babies must feel like that, but you actually know. Since you do\u2014you\u2019re going to have to convince the little darling to come on out. Your body is ready.\u201d</p><p>Sascha touched her babe\u2019s mind. It\u2019s warm in my arms, too, she cajoled. Your papa\u2019s waiting to kiss you, pet you. Don\u2019t you want that?</p><p>A vocal negative, for all that their child had no words yet.</p><p>\u201cCome on, princess,\u201d Lucas murmured in his deep voice, stroking Sascha\u2019s abdomen with strong, loving hands as she lay with her back to his chest, \u201cyou know I\u2019ve been waiting a long time for you. How am I ever going to hold you if you stay in there?\u201d</p><p>The baby wasn\u2019t convinced, but Sascha felt a slight hesitation. \u201cKeep talking,\u201d she said, continuing to reassure their child with her own loving murmurs until another contraction bowed her back.</p><p>The baby was shocked, scared.</p><p>You\u2019re safe. You\u2019re safe. She wrapped it in a warm blanket of love. I\u2019ve got you, my baby.</p><p>\u201cThis time,\u201d Tamsyn ordered, \u201cpush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear that, princess?\u201d Lucas whispered, pressing his lips to Sascha\u2019s temple. \u201cHelp your mama out.\u201d</p><p>Their child still wasn\u2019t sure they knew what they were talking about, but it was ready.</p><p>Just in the nick of time.</p><p>The next contraction almost lifted Sascha off the bed. She forgot all about funneling pain, all about doing anything but pushing, her grip on Lucas\u2019s hand a steel trap.</p><p>\u201cOne more time,\u201d Tammy\u2019s encouraging voice. \u201cCome on, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>As Sascha shuddered, tried to breathe, Lucas tangled his fingers with those of her other hand, too, bent to press his lips to her ear. \u201cI\u2019ve got you, Sascha darling.\u201d</p><p>Those were the last words she heard before she pushed one final time, and suddenly, her child was no longer inside of her, its angry screams filling the air. Our baby. Her heart clenched, and she felt Lucas stop breathing. \u201cGo cut the cord,\u201d she urged him, knowing he was torn between the need to hold her and cradling their baby. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>Sliding out from behind her with care, he followed Tammy\u2019s directions to cut the cord. The wonder on his face as he took their squalling child into his arms was a gift for Sascha\u2019s heart, a moment she would never, ever forget. \u201cHush, sweet darling.\u201d A deep murmur that washed over mother and child both. \u201cPapa\u2019s got you.\u201d When he looked up, those wild green eyes shimmered with such protective love that she knew their child would never, for one single minute, feel unwanted, unloved.</p><p>Fingers shaking, she opened the top buttons of her maternity smock. Lucas moved to lay their baby skin to skin against her without a word. Tears rolling down her face, Sascha held their baby\u2019s fragile body while her mate cupped her cheek and touched his forehead to hers. \u201cGod, I love you.\u201d</p><p>Her laughter was tear wet. \u201cEven now you\u2019ve gotten your little princess?\u201d</p><p>Lucas\u2019s smile creased his cheeks, brought the cat into his eyes. \u201cI told you it was a girl.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 25</p><p>SIENNA FELT AS if she\u2019d burst out of her skin when she heard the baby\u2019s first cry.</p><p>The bedroom door opened what seemed like years later to reveal Lucas holding a tiny\u2014so tiny\u2014bundle wrapped in a soft white blanket. The sentinels and their mates, all of whom had arrived over the past two hours, crowded into the cabin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you,\u201d Lucas said, his smile touched with a fierce tenderness, \u201cto meet Miss Nadiya Shayla Hunter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dorian peered at the baby. \u201cCan I hold her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t flirt,\u201d Lucas said as he handed the baby to the blond sentinel, who was immediately surrounded by his mate as well as the mates of the other men. Stealing the newborn for a cuddle, the women finally handed her back to a scowling Dorian before slipping in to see Sascha. Laughter drifted out of the bedroom soon afterward.</p><p>Deciding to take advantage of the lower number of people between her and the baby, Sienna made strategic moves around the room until she ended up next to Mercy\u2014who\u2019d stolen Nadiya from Nate, who\u2019d stolen her from Clay, who\u2019d stolen her from Dorian.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Mercy said, \u201cyou want to hold her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m terrified.\u201d It was the first time in her life she\u2019d ever said that aloud.</p><p>Laughing, Mercy showed Sienna how to support the baby\u2019s head, and then Nadiya was in her arms. \u201cShe\u2019s so small.\u201d Brushing aside the blanket, she looked at that miniature face, those fisted hands with their tiny fingers and miniscule nails. Lucas and Sascha\u2019s baby had slept through the adoration, but she waved her fists now before settling back down. Sienna was fascinated, could\u2019ve watched her for hours.</p><p>Aware, however, that everyone in the room wanted to hold the newborn, she reluctantly relinquished her to Vaughn. The jaguar sentinel touched a gentle finger to the sleeping child\u2019s nose. \u201cHello, little Naya,\u201d he said. \u201cAren\u2019t you a pretty darling?\u201d</p><p>Lucas smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s what Sascha thought for a pet name, too.\u201d Reaching out, he took the baby from Vaughn\u2019s careful hands. \u201cCome on, princess. Mama\u2019s missing you already\u2014you can break hearts later.\u201d</p><p>Everyone laughed. And that was the sound Sienna remembered most as she described the events to fellow SnowDancers later that night.</p> <p>\u201cWe got a message both mother and child were doing well,\u201d Hawke said, leaning against the counter of the common room where they\u2019d gathered, \u201cbut I figured I\u2019d better not go down just yet.\u201d</p><p>Sienna, sitting at a table opposite him, had to fight the urge to get up, cross the distance between them, and reinitiate the contact that had been missing for over twenty-four hours. Now that she\u2019d touched him, kissed him, she couldn\u2019t imagine how she\u2019d survived before. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d she said. \u201cLucas is very close to his cat right now.\u201d The alpha\u2019s eyes had been those of the panther\u2014a happy panther, but still a wild thing.</p><p>\u201cWhat does the baby look like?\u201d Brenna asked from beside her, jumpy with excitement.</p><p>\u201cTiny with her eyes scrunched shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarlee looked like that, too,\u201d Walker said when the laughter faded. \u201cShe cried as if she\u2019d had her favorite toy stolen from her\u2014on both the physical and psychic plane.\u201d</p><p>Judd glanced at his brother. \u201cShe was loud.\u201d</p> <p>Sienna hadn\u2019t known her uncles had both been around at the time of Marlee\u2019s birth. Before she could ask about that, Brenna touched Judd\u2019s thigh, where he sat beside her. \u201cHow do they handle childbirth in the Net, honeypie?\u201d The last word was clearly a private joke, because Judd reached out to tap his mate\u2019s lips, saying, \u201cRemember the rules.\u201d</p><p>It was Walker who answered Brenna\u2019s question. \u201cA strong telepath,\u201d he said from where he sat on Sienna\u2019s left-hand side, \u201cwill ease the mother into a near-unconscious state as he or she takes over the fetus\u2019s mind for the duration of the labor.\u201d</p><p>A long silence.</p><p>Sienna hadn\u2019t known that, found herself asking, \u201cDoesn\u2019t it hurt the baby?\u201d</p><p>Walker shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s something our race used to do before Silence\u2014the telepaths are trained to handle developing minds. We had to come up with something since women in childbirth are unable to neutralize their pain on any level.\u201d</p><p>Sienna believed him about the birthing process not harming the fetus\u2014Psy cared too much about the mind to risk damaging one. \u201cI think I heard Tammy say that Sascha was talking to her baby to convince her to come out. Wouldn\u2019t that kind of connection be worth the pain?\u201d Her eye caught Hawke\u2019s at that moment, glimpsed the dark, unnamable emotion in the wolf-blue.</p><p>She knew without asking that he was thinking of his mate, of the children he would never have with her. But for the first time, Sienna didn\u2019t turn away, didn\u2019t yield to a ghost\u2014she\u2019d listened, she\u2019d learned, so she knew that while it was harder than in a mating, changelings could and did have children in long-term, committed relationships.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s eyes narrowed at the challenge in hers. Later, after everyone else had left the room, he snapped his fingers around her wrist, tugged her close and whispered, \u201cYou sure you want to play with the wolf, baby?\u201d</p> <p>Her stomach somersaulted, but she was ready. \u201cSure you\u2019re ready to handle an X, wolf?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>FOUR HOURS LATER, in a fortified compound in Southern Australia, Tatiana Rika-Smythe looked at images of the wreckage that had once been a solid marble sculpture. The cost of the piece\u2014miniscule\u2014was of no relevance. The destruction was a message, and as that, it hit the mark. She used the comm panel to input a call to Henry.</p><p>It wouldn\u2019t go through to his London residence, so she traced him via the PsyNet. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d she began when he answered her psychic hail.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have this conversation now, Tatiana,\u201d he interrupted without any attempt at courtesy and disappeared back into his mind.</p><p>Tatiana wasn\u2019t used to being brushed off, but she was also not stupid. Dropping out of the PsyNet, she brought up the feed from the spy satellite she used to get information on Henry, having increased her surveillance of him after he\u2019d begun to act in away that suggested he had become the driving force in the Scott partnership.</p><p>A two-second delay and the visuals came into crisp focus. Henry\u2019s London residence was collapsing. Slowly enough that she could see it had been evacuated, but there was no way to rescue it. The charges had been laid with careful precision\u2014which begged the question of how anyone could\u2019ve skirted Henry\u2019s security to get that close to the building.</p><p>Certain now that there would be a third target site, she began switching through the news channels. It took her only seconds to find it. Shoshanna\u2019s new office tower looked spectacular as glass fell in rippling blue sheets from its windows. The building was a skeleton in under a minute, its metal bones gleaming under the unforgiving desert sun.</p><p>The conclusion was clear\u2014the Scotts had underestimated the changelings. Again.</p><p>Picking up her cell phone, she sent Henry a text message, the method of communication an indication of precisely how much she valued his mind at present. Leave me out of it.</p><p>HENRY received a call three minutes after Tatiana\u2019s curt message.</p><p>\u201cA miscalculation,\u201d the male voice said. \u201cBut better now than later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Henry said, \u201cyou don\u2019t plan to pull out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>\u201cWE MIGHT HAVE given them pause,\u201d Hawke said to Riley, Riaz, and Indigo as they stood on a cliff overlooking SnowDancer territory four days after the retaliation, \u201cbut they\u2019ve succeeded in one respect. We\u2019re running at high alert\u2014how long can we keep that up before our people begin to get exhausted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an idea about that.\u201d Riley\u2019s eyes swept over the clearing below, and Hawke knew he was looking out for the sentry on duty. \u201cA soldier can maintain this pace for a week without starting to slip\u2014we run each for five days, swap him out with a soldier from one of the other sectors.\u201d</p><p>Right then, a wolf loped across the verdant land below and into the thick stand of firs that seemed to sprawl to the horizon. Tai, Hawke thought, identifying the large tan-colored wolf. \u201cCan that be done without flicking up warning flags?\u201d They could betray no hint of weakness.</p><p>\u201cWe do it in stages,\u201d Indigo said, namesake eyes even more intense in the mountain sunlight. \u201cSet it up so the ones closest to den territory are moved in first, those who are farther out rolling in to take their places. We do it right, no one knows any different\u2014Psy sure as hell can\u2019t tell one wolf from another when we\u2019re in animal form.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for you,\u201d Riaz muttered to Hawke. \u201cBecause you have the bad taste to be a color that yells \u2018Here I am, shoot me now.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see who\u2019s a target when the snow falls, shall we?\u201d Hawke turned a fraction to welcome the feral wolves loping up the rise. They wiggled between Indigo and Riley\u2014on either side of him\u2014to press against his legs.</p><p>\u201cSpoiled,\u201d Indigo said, shaking her head. \u201cThey think you\u2019re theirs.\u201d</p><p>Hawke let his lips curve a little. \u201cDo the rotation. But shorten the shifts to four days spread out over a week\u2014I want everyone rested up if we have to kick into full defensive mode. Can we work that?\u201d</p><p>Riley and Indigo both nodded, though Indigo was the one to speak. \u201cI think it might actually work better that way.\u201d She growled when one of the feral wolves pushed too hard.</p><p>The wolf retreated.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the cats?\u201d Riaz asked, hunkering down to mock fight with another wolf. \u201cAre they going to need extra manpower in the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve talked to Mercy about it,\u201d Riley said, \u201cand we\u2019re splitting duties unless any of you disagree. Leopards are going to focus on San Francisco while we handle the rest. We\u2019re also aligning our sentries so rather than doubling up in some spots, we\u2019re going to start working DarkRiver and SnowDancer land as one big territory.\u201d</p><p>No one disagreed, and for a moment, they simply stood there, looking out over the flourishing green of the valley, the slender spires of the pines, the jagged snow-kissed peaks of the mountains. It was a beautiful piece of the earth, but more, it was their heartland, singing a song of welcome to any lost or wounded wolf.</p><p>\u201cWe fight,\u201d Hawke said quietly. \u201cAll the way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>SURE you\u2019re ready to handle an X, wolf?</p><p>The operation against the Councilors and the ensuing time he\u2019d spent helping maintain security, along with his other responsibilities as alpha\u2014in combination with Sienna\u2019s duty schedule\u2014had kept him from following up on her brazen challenge, but Hawke was ready to hunt today. Unfortunately, Judd had other ideas.</p><p>The Psy male walked into his office just as he was about to head out. \u201cWe need to discuss the Pure Psy camp in South America.\u201d Using the comm panel on the wall, he brought up surveillance footage on one side, a map on the other.</p> <p>\u201cHow recent is this?\u201d Hawke asked from beside him.</p><p>\u201cEarly this morning. I\u2019ve kept a constant eye on any and all movements since I first became aware of its purpose.\u201d</p><p>Hidden deep in the mountains, Hawke knew the small \u201cvillage\u201d was a training facility for Henry Scott\u2019s increasing army of fanatics.</p><p>\u201cAs we discussed when I first located it,\u201d Judd continued, \u201cit didn\u2019t make sense to eliminate or disable them at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter to know where the bastards are hiding,\u201d Hawke muttered, zooming in on an aerial photograph taken by a falcon in animal form.</p> <p>Judd wondered if Hawke had thought that far ahead when negotiating the alliance with WindHaven. Knowing the way the alpha\u2019s mind worked, Judd wouldn\u2019t be surprised. \u201cHowever,\u201d he added, pulling up an overlay that showed the population inside the camp, \u201cthere\u2019s been a significant increase in their numbers in the past three weeks. They\u2019ve also begun to bring in a large number of weapons. Intel about their target remains the same.\u201d The city, den territory.</p><p>\u201cWill they be able to teleport out that many people and weapons at a speed that could prove dangerous to our defenses?\u201d</p><p>Judd took a moment to do the mental calculations. \u201cIf they had an Arrow named Vasic, it would be a problem.\u201d Vasic was a Tk-V, the only true teleporter in the Net. He was also one of the extremely rare Tks who could go to people as well as places. As such, he\u2019d have discovered the Laurens two seconds after they dropped out of the PsyNet if Walker hadn\u2019t used his considerable telepathic skill to create and then teach both Sienna and Judd how to weave a deflective shield around their minds prior to defection.</p><p>His brother had handled the children, though Toby, Marlee, and in all probability, Sienna, no longer needed that shield, their appearance having changed enough to deny Vasic a \u201clock.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen no sign of him in the surveillance footage, however,\u201d he continued, \u201cand there\u2019s no indication that Henry has Arrow support.\u201d Though Judd\u2019s gut said at least some of the squad would find themselves compelled by the idea of Purity, of unadulterated Silence, of the promise of peace from the raging violence of their abilities.</p><p>Hawke brought up an older report. \u201cHenry lost several telekinetics in the last skirmish with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, so even a generous estimate of the number remaining in his unit doesn\u2019t give him anywhere near the capacity to move the camp using Tk. Logic says he\u2019ll want to save their energy for the assault, so the camp will mobilize using more standard means.\u201d Increasing the image size, he pointed out the half-complete runway. \u201cWe need to start thinking about how we\u2019re going to disable them when the time comes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIdeas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not subtle, but I could work at rigging the entire place to blow, focusing on the sections where they\u2019ve stockpiled weapons.\u201d He could teleport in under cover of night, place the charges, and be gone with security unaware of a breach. \u201cIf I link the charges to a remote signal, we can detonate when necessary.\u201d</p><p>Hawke shifted the images around, bringing up more detailed terrain and aerial maps, the population overlay. \u201cThe area is too large for you to handle alone\u2014the teleporting will wipe you out,\u201d the alpha said at last, displaying an understanding of Judd\u2019s abilities that, at one time, would\u2019ve surprised him. That was before he\u2019d learned that Hawke knew the capabilities of each of his lieutenants down to the wire. \u201cAside from the delay while you recover, a second incursion increases the chances of discovery.\u201d</p><p>Judd had to agree. \u201cAlexei and Drew would both be suitable for this kind of an op, but it\u2019s a risk to go in with anyone who can\u2019t teleport out, though I can handle a second individual if the circumstances demand a quick exit.\u201d It was the other issue that was more problematic. \u201cThe guards will be on constant alert for non-Psy minds. Even a hint of an intruder, and floodlights will blaze over the entire compound.\u201d Not to mention the number of Pure Psy units who\u2019d respond to mount a search.</p><p>Hawke cleared the maps and brought up a list of names. \u201cPsy in the packs. Who has the training to do what you need?\u201d</p><p>When the Lauren family had first joined SnowDancer, Hawke would\u2019ve never trusted two Psy with such a critical operation. It humbled Judd, how the changelings had the capacity to accept with such depth and honesty. Once Pack, you had to betray their trust at the basest level to be booted out. It was, he thought, strangely akin to the blood-loyalty that tied the Arrows to one another. An odd correlation.</p><p>\u201cWalker is an exceptionally strong telepath,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he\u2019s had no training in handling explosives.\u201d No, his brother had been trained in something far more subtle. \u201cAshaya isn\u2019t military. Neither are Faith or Sascha\u2014quite aside from Sascha\u2019s current physical status.\u201d</p><p>He brought up a separate screen. The woman on it wasn\u2019t Pack, but she was linked to a group that had proven friendly. \u201cKatya Haas has had some military instruction, from what I\u2019ve been able to discover, but not enough to make her suitable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Santos would go for the idea anyway.\u201d Hawke rubbed his jaw as he named Katya\u2019s husband\u2014the head of the Shine Foundation. \u201cYou trust any of your other contacts?\u201d</p><p>Judd thought of the Ghost and his enigmatic priorities. \u201cNo.\u201d Then he added another name to the list of Psy who were Pack. \u201cShe has both the training and the psychic skill to escape detection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Flat. No room for compromise. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019d even suggest it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIgnoring who and what she is,\u201d Judd said, fighting his own instinctive need to protect the girl who looked so much like his lost sister, \u201cis more dangerous than taking her into an operation.\u201d Sienna wasn\u2019t only powerful, she was disciplined and knew how to obey orders in a tactical situation. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason Maria felt compelled to challenge her. You know it and so do I.\u201d</p><p>Hawke had been called a cold-hearted bastard more than once. But never when it came to those who were his\u2014he valued the life of each and every member of his pack, would lay down his own for them without blinking. \u201cI don\u2019t send novices into situations that could be lethal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what this is about.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf bristled at the quiet challenge. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t send Maria or Riordan, even Tai, into that situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of those three spent ten years living with Ming LeBon.\u201d Judd kept speaking as Hawke\u2019s vision went wolf-bright. \u201cShe was taught to handle explosives when she was nine years old.\u201d</p><p>Hawke snapped his head around to face the former Arrow. \u201cNot even in the Net would they do that to a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they would.\u201d Judd stared at the stone walls with piercing intensity. \u201cWhat better way to teach a child control than to put her in a room designed to blow up with her inside if she got something wrong.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf wanted to savage the bastards who\u2019d tortured Sienna, its rage turning his voice almost unintelligible as he growled, \u201cDamn it, Judd. You were an Arrow!\u201d</p><p>Judd flinched. It was such a slight reaction Hawke only caught it because his wolf was watching the other man with a predator\u2019s gaze. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t risk defection when Marlee and Toby were babies.\u201d Words so precise, they were coated in frost. \u201cThere was a high probability the severance of the PsyNet link\u2014and we always knew we\u2019d have to do that to truly escape\u2014would\u2019ve killed them outright.\u201d</p><p>A metal letter opener flew off Hawke\u2019s desk and slammed into the stone wall, the handle quivering from the force of the impact. Judd closed his eyes, fisted his hands. It took him over two minutes to speak again. \u201cWe had to wait.\u201d The bleakness in those words betrayed the cost paid for that wait.</p><p>With a wolf, Hawke would\u2019ve clamped him on the shoulder, dragged him into a hug. But Judd wasn\u2019t wolf. Grabbing the handle of the letter opener, he pulled it out with a grunt and handed it to the Psy male. \u201cGet it out.\u201d</p><p>The letter opener began to twist methodically into a complicated shape before being crushed into an unrecognizable ball of metal, which Judd began to slam into the wall again and again using his telekinesis. Stone chips flew to the floor.</p><p>\u201cDid Sienna know she was going to be getting out?\u201d Hawke asked when he judged the Psy male was able to speak again. Know she hadn\u2019t been abandoned?</p><p>\u201cNo. Not for a long time.\u201d Judd caught the distorted ball, held it in his hand. \u201cShe was too young, and she spent the majority of her time with Ming. We could only trust her with the plan once her shields were strong enough to hide her thoughts from him.\u201d</p><p>Hawke imagined Sienna as a small girl with eyes of cardinal starlight and hair of darkest red; thought, too, of the fear that must\u2019ve stolen her breath, squeezed her chest as she was locked inside rooms full of explosives. \u201cOne slip of her gift . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a lie at first,\u201d Judd said. \u201cMing wouldn\u2019t have risked a cardinal X in such an accident. When she did make a mistake, they triggered explosions calibrated to knock her unconscious and injure her enough that she\u2019d remember to be more careful next time.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s claws sliced out. \u201cAnd later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe asked to be put in those rooms.\u201d The metal ball spun at rapid speed in the air. \u201cShe had to know she\u2019d be safe enough to defect with us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hawke didn\u2019t know whether he wanted to strangle Sienna for playing with her life that way or hold her tight, shield her from the world.

Even after all she\u2019d been through, Sienna had never been afraid to stand up to him. Good. \u201cI want this planned down to the last minute\u2014in and out as fast as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Judd gave a swift nod, his eyes holding an icy determination, an echo of the memories. \u201cI\u2019ll do the prep work today. I\u2019d rather reserve my psychic energies, so we\u2019ll fly out tomorrow morning into one of the larger cities. I can teleport us the rest of the distance after nightfall. Do you want in on the planning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hawke knew his instincts when it came to Sienna would get in the way. \u201cKeep me updated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Sienna now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJudd.\u201d When the lieutenant halted, Hawke walked over and dragged him into a rough embrace. Psy or not, he was a SnowDancer. \u201cThank you for getting her out.\u201d For protecting her when Hawke hadn\u2019t known she was out there, hurting.</p><p>Judd\u2019s eyes were midnight when he pulled back. \u201cShe\u2019s stronger than all of us.\u201d</p> <p>The words circled in Hawke\u2019s mind long after Judd left, but they didn\u2019t make his decision any easier to swallow. He was about to send a young woman, his woman, into a hot zone.</p><p>JUDD needed his mate with a ferocity bordering on insanity. All but dragging her from her workspace in the tech core of the den, he pulled her into their bedroom and pinned her to the wall. She gasped into his kiss but cooperated when he tore off her clothes, when he opened the front of his jeans and lifted her up by the thighs.</p><p>Too fast, too fast, his mind warned. Gritting his teeth, he tried to slow down.</p><p>The whisper was a soft, hot breath against his ear. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. Come inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrenna.\u201d Thrusting into the tight, wet heat of her in a single hard push, he shuddered.</p><p>Her nails dug into his back, her legs wrapped around his waist, and her mouth, it took his, holding him safe as he surrendered to the searing depth of his need for her.</p> <p>Afterward, as they lay on the futon, he told her everything. \u201cI wish I could protect her from this, but if we don\u2019t give her an outlet, it\u2019ll lead to a dangerous level of frustration.\u201d</p><p>Brenna drew patterns on his chest with a fingertip. \u201cWe women are tougher than you men realize.\u201d Propping herself up on one elbow beside him, she braced her cheek on her hand. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need that kind of protection anymore\u2014you\u2019re giving her what she needs; support to live her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t interfered, but this thing with Hawke . . . I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, no woman\u2019s ever going to be ready for Hawke.\u201d It was the driest of statements as she leaned in to press an affectionate kiss to his jaw. \u201cBut from what I can see, she\u2019s holding her own.\u201d</p><p>Her words, her touch, it anchored him, settled him. \u201cI need you,\u201d he said to her, this woman who\u2019d fought for her own right to live her life free of limits, \u201cto build me some remote detonation devices.\u201d</p><p>Amazing brown eyes shot with blue peering into his as she pressed her nose to his. \u201cYou always say the most romantic things.\u201d</p><p>His laughter came from deep within, tangled with her own, as his mate cupped his cheek and took him with a tenderness that made him her slave.</p><p>RECOVERED FROM COMPUTER 2(A) TAGS: PERSONAL CORRESPONDENCE, FATHER, E-PSY, ACTION REQUIRED BUT NOT COMPLETED4</p> <p>FROM: Alice &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>TO: Dad &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>DATE: December 11th, 1973 at 11:23pm</p><p>SUBJECT: re: Silence</p><p>Dear Dad,</p><p>Yes, this idea of Silence disturbs me, too.

It had shocked her when Judd told her about the upcoming op\u2014but not because she couldn\u2019t do it. The exercise would be relatively free from danger given the strength of her shields and the fact that she could debilitate anyone who threatened her. Of course, contact was to be avoided at all costs, their objective being to get in and out without being detected.</p><p>Soft warmth covered her shoulders.</p><p>Startled, she turned to see Hawke. It was his jacket he\u2019d put over her shoulders. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to play our game.\u201d The part of her that had never had a chance to be a child was bitterly disappointed.</p><p>He sat down with one hand braced on the ground behind her, their bodies close enough that they touched hip to thigh . . . more. \u201cIt\u2019ll keep.\u201d</p><p>Unwilling to let it go at that, she held out a fist. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to attempt to beat me up with that puny hand?\u201d Complete disbelief. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll pretend it hurts.\u201d</p><p>She would not laugh. To do so would only feed his arrogance. \u201cTry again.\u201d</p><p>Frowning, he held out his own larger fist, smiled. \u201cOne, two, three!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRock beats scissors.\u201d It was impossible to restrain her smirk.</p><p>A very wolfish look. \u201cBest of three.\u201d</p><p>She held out a hand, called the countdown. Found her paper being cut by the scissors. Laughing at the playful way he pretended to chop at her, she made a fist again. \u201cLast one.\u201d</p><p>They moved their hands in unison.</p><p>Hawke grinned at the result. \u201cWell, there are people who say we both have rocks in our heads, so I guess that\u2019s apropos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeak for yourself.\u201d But she curled her hand back inside his jacket, luxuriating in the dark masculinity of his scent. \u201cJudd told me about South America.\u201d A silent question hidden behind the statement.</p><p>\u201cWe need to discuss that.\u201d No longer any humor in his voice. \u201cI need to be certain you\u2019re not only onboard with this, but capable of doing it.\u201d</p><p>The words pricked her pride. Once, she might\u2019ve snapped at him, but she was no longer that impetuous girl, hiding her mental fragmentation behind a mask of rebellion. Instead, she considered things from his point of view: a young, untried soldier going into an operation that required the utmost subtlety. If she\u2019d been in charge, she\u2019d have asked the same questions. \u201cYes, to both,\u201d she said. \u201cJudd didn\u2019t know until I told him this afternoon, but I did an op very similar to this in a training situation.\u201d</p><p>He stroked his hand up her back to curve around her nape, hot and strong, a shock to her system. \u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen,\u201d she said over the wild rush of sensation. \u201cMing gave me a very simple brief\u2014to get in and out of one of his installations. To pass, I had to set a number of charges in different locations and escape undetected.\u201d When Hawke remained silent, she asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know if I succeeded?\u201d</p><p>He moved his thumb on her skin. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have remained Ming\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9e if you hadn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Goose bumps on her flesh that had nothing to do with the temperature. \u201cBut I did make one error\u2014I escaped even Ming\u2019s detection.\u201d</p><p>Rising without warning, Hawke took a seat behind her, pulling her into the circle of his arms, the bracket of his thighs. \u201cOkay?\u201d An intimate question against the sensitive curve of her ear.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Except for the fact her heart was about to beat right out of her chest.</p><p>\u201cThe student showed up the teacher,\u201d he said, returning to their discussion of Ming. \u201cThat\u2019s when you knew you didn\u2019t have much time left.\u201d</p><p>Unable to resist, she curled one of her hands around the corded strength of his forearm, playing her fingers over the vein that ran so strong under the heat of his skin. \u201cThe rehab order came only a few months later. All orders are officially from the entire Council, but the Councilors act as individuals most of the time. Ming\u2019s signature was on ours. If he ever finds out I\u2019m alive, he\u2019ll do everything he can to get rid of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Muscle and tendon flexed under her touch as he tugged her closer. \u201cAccording to our intel, Ming has taken a couple of hits in the past few months. He might decide he\u2019s better off with you by his side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d kill him,\u201d Sienna said with cold precision. \u201cThe instant I had him in my sights, I\u2019d burn him up and watch him die. And I\u2019d make it slow, so he\u2019d hurt for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t tell her that wasn\u2019t a good thought, that revenge would eat her alive. Instead, he nuzzled at her neck, and said, \u201cI\u2019d rather you focus your energy on helping the pack.\u201d</p><p>She angled her head to the side in shameless invitation, her hand moving up to close over his bicep. \u201cI\u2019d do anything for SnowDancer.\u201d For you.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your designation.\u201d Kisses along the line of her throat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her toes curled. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy X?\u201d The kiss of teeth.</p><p>Instead of pulling away, she gripped his arm tight. \u201cSome people say it\u2019s from the Latin word exardesco, which means \u2018to blaze up.\u2019 \u201d The words came out husky. \u201cI think \u2018rage\u2019 is also another way it can be defined.\u201d</p> <p>He raised his head, and it was then that she realized what it was she was saying, what it betrayed. No wonder he didn\u2019t want to touch her. Ice in her veins, she straightened and finished the story, because that was the only thing she could do. \u201cIt\u2019s said we were once called the burning ones, so the Latin roots would make sense. But I\u2019ve always thought it was because of what we leave behind when we go supernova: nothing.\u201d</p><p>Hawke snarled at the self-condemnation in that last word. \u201cWould you call me a monster, Sienna?\u201d</p><p>She tried to jerk up and out of his hold. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t release her. \u201cYet I\u2019ve killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn defense of your pack,\u201d she said, her hand gripping his forearm again, her touch satisfying a bone-deep need. \u201cThat\u2019s different.\u201d</p> <p>He regretted none of the blood he\u2019d spilled in defense of those who were his own, but\u2014\u201cIt leaves a mark on the soul nonetheless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was younger,\u201d she said in a voice so quiet it was near soundless, \u201cmy hold on the cold fire erratic at best, Ming would put those he wanted executed in a room with me, and then he\u2019d use every psychic method he had to push me over. It was his way of teaching me control.\u201d A jagged breath. \u201cHe made sure they were conscious. The screams . . . I hear them in my sleep, over and over, and over again.\u201d</p><p>Hawke clenched his jaw to keep his claws inside his body, knowing that wasn\u2019t what she needed. \u201cThat\u2019s on him, baby. Not you. Never you.\u201d</p><p>Sienna dipped her head, her hair sliding forward to obscure her face. \u201cPeople think that after the first kill, it becomes easier. It never does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It struck him then that this wasn\u2019t a conversation he should have been able to have with a nineteen-year-old woman. Yet that made it no less real, made her scars no less deep.</p><p>Dipping his head to push back her hair and kiss the throbbing pulse in her neck, he said, \u201cTurn around,\u201d his voice rough with the raw fury of his emotions.</p> <p>A shiver as she twisted around to face him on her knees. His jacket slipped off, but he put it back around her shoulders, finding a primal satisfaction both in keeping her warm and in having her covered in his scent. \u201cEnough talk of death,\u201d he murmured, sliding his hand under the cool silk of her hair to cup her nape\u2014driven by the wild need to do everything he could to wipe the sadness from her. \u201cLet\u2019s live.\u201d He dropped his eyes to her mouth.</p><p>Her lips flushed under his regard, her pulse thudding in a rapid tattoo that drove his wolf insane. \u201cScared?\u201d He traced the full curves with one fingertip.</p><p>\u201cYou do bite.\u201d</p><p>Smile creasing his cheeks, he gripped her chin, pressing down with his thumb to part her lips, and then he kissed her. No sweet, playful thing this, but a hot, wet demand that had a moan escaping her throat, her body arching against the hard wall of his chest.</p><p>He half expected her to shy as she had that night outside the den, but her fingers clenched on his shoulders, her lips generous and sweet under his voracious mouth. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t give me everything I want,\u201d he chided.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it makes me greedy.\u201d Stroking his hand down over her throat to her chest as he claimed her lips again, he curved his hand over the lush swell of one breast.</p><p>She froze.</p> <p>Nipping at her lips, he flicked his thumb across the taut peak he could feel through her thin black sweater, had the satisfaction of shocking a gasp out of her. \u201cNow imagine,\u201d he murmured in her ear before kissing that beautiful throat once more, drinking in the quivering intoxication of her arousal, \u201cwhat it\u2019ll feel like when I rub your nipples after I\u2019ve stripped you bare.\u201d</p><p>Sienna shuddered. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>Petting her down from the edge, he took his hand off her body, his lips off her skin, and nudged her until she lay on her back on the earth, his jacket protecting her from the cold. \u201cIs this hurting you?\u201d He\u2019d caught no indication of it, but he had to be sure.</p><p>A quick shake of her head. \u201cWe disabled that layer of dissonance.\u201d</p><p>That layer.</p><p>Which meant there were more, but they wouldn\u2019t talk about the subject tonight, because tonight, he wanted to pleasure her, tease her, indulge her. \u201cPretty, troublesome Sienna,\u201d he whispered, bracing himself beside her on one elbow and stroking his hand under the bottom of her V-neck sweater to lie over the taut smoothness of her abdomen.</p><p>Her muscles tensed under his touch, her eyes dark as the night.</p><p>\u201cThat feels . . .\u201d A trembling breath. \u201cMay I touch you?\u201d</p><p>His cock, already rock hard, turned excruciating at the polite question. That was when he realized he didn\u2019t have the patience to play with her, to ease her into the storm of his sexuality. Not today, when his wolf had been pushed to the edge by what she\u2019d shared, the decision he\u2019d made.</p><p>More, Sienna needed to rest, to preserve her strength for the op.</p><p>Groaning, he kissed her hard and wild, then rolled up to his feet, dragging a bewildered Sienna up with him. Unable to stop himself, he cupped her face, took her mouth again with possessive heat. \u201cWe\u2019ll finish this\u201d\u2014another kiss\u2014\u201clater.\u201d A bite on her lower lip. \u201cAfter you get back.\u201d With that, he bent, grabbed his jacket, and put it around her.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t ready for the kiss she laid on him.</p><p>Son of a bitch.</p><p>His hands clenched on her hips, one step away from pulling her up and against the hard ridge of his cock. From there, it\u2019d be about two seconds before he had her sweater shoved up to her neck, her bra ripped off so he could feast on her breasts. Another five\u2014maybe ten because he had a feeling he\u2019d be greedy about her breasts\u2014before she was pinned naked to the nearest tree.</p><p>Wrenching away from the enticement of her, he stalked to the edge of the rise, but he was still too close, the autumn and spice of her lingering in his mouth, in the air, on his skin. Teeth gritted, he scrambled down the slope to the lake and walked to the water\u2019s edge to throw the frigid liquid on his face. Christ!</p><p>His wolf, though not normally bothered by the cold, didn\u2019t care for the shock, but it was in control by the time Sienna joined him. He pointed a finger toward her. \u201cBehave\u2014unless you want to be naked and under me in about five seconds flat.\u201d Or maybe the wolf wasn\u2019t in control.</p><p>She blinked, swallowed, shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m quite ready.\u201d</p><p>Neither did he. Which was why he had trickles of icy water rolling down his neck as he got to his feet. \u201cDo you like the lake?\u201d Not the most subtle change in the direction of the conversation, but he wasn\u2019t exactly Mr. Smooth right then.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She fell into step beside him. \u201cIt\u2019s peaceful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to play down here with my friends all the time as a child.\u201d Rissa had loved jumping in the water in wolf form.</p><p>\u201cDid you love her very much?\u201d Quiet, quiet words.</p><p>Though she\u2019d voiced the question, he could tell from the way she held herself, her face wiped of expression, that she expected him to tell her it was none of her business. It was what he\u2019d have done, had it been any other person of her rank. Except it wasn\u2019t any other person asking this. It was the woman he\u2019d kissed senseless a minute ago, the woman he was sending into a potentially lethal situation tomorrow, the woman who\u2019d had a hold on him since the instant their eyes collided in that dark green glade the day of her defection.</p><p>\u201cWe were children,\u201d he began, voice husky with memory. \u201cI only knew her for three years.\u201d They\u2019d spent those three years in each other\u2019s constant company. \u201cWe were two of the lucky ones\u2014we found each other early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d There was a deep, haunting curiosity in her face, in her words. \u201cThat she was your mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew.\u201d It was a resonance of the soul, a hunger of the heart, a sweet welcome home he\u2019d missed every day since her death. \u201cI was five years old when she was born and seven when we met. I remember walking along the corridors with my mother the first time I saw her.</p><p>\u201cLater, my mother told me that all of a sudden, I just turned down a hallway and began running.\u201d She\u2019d always laughed as she told that story, his gifted, fey mother with her sea green eyes and wild tumble of hair. \u201cShe was so startled that she decided to let me be, see what was so interesting. Until I ran into the nursery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Tarah the nursery supervisor then?\u201d she asked, naming Indigo\u2019s mother.</p><p>\u201cNo, and Evie hadn\u2019t even been born.\u201d He couldn\u2019t believe that so many years had passed . . . that Rissa had been gone all that time. \u201cMy mother was sure I\u2019d gotten myself in big trouble for interrupting naptime, especially when she found me laughing with a toddler with thick black curls and brown eyes.\u201d</p><p>He would never forget the wonder that had bloomed inside him when Rissa smiled at him. Mine. A crystal-clear thought. As a child, he\u2019d had no understanding of the depth to which that feeling would one day grow\u2014back then, it had been a simple, primal possessiveness. \u201cThe healer at the time told me that that was the earliest she\u2019d ever known for a changeling to find his mate.\u201d Some people took years to awaken to each other; Drew and Indigo were the perfect example.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d Sienna\u2019s words sang with wonder. \u201cShe lived the majority of her life knowing she would never be alone, that someone would catch her whenever she fell.\u201d</p><p>Hawke hadn\u2019t ever considered it in that light, so that Rissa\u2019s short life was touched only with joy not sorrow. \u201cThank you.\u201d Feeling the most furious tenderness in his heart for this woman who bore so many scars on her soul, he stroked his hand over the heavy silk of her hair. \u201cStay safe. We have something important to finish when you get back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>LARA tracked Walker down the morning after Sienna and Judd left the den with such stealth, she\u2019d never have known they were gone if she hadn\u2019t gotten up before dawn to check up on Elias and glimpsed them slipping out. When she\u2019d confronted Hawke, pointing out that she ranked as high as a lieutenant, he\u2019d told her what was going on.</p><p>Now, she pushed open the door to the small workspace she knew Walker had commandeered in an isolated section of the den. His tools lay neatly along a bench he\u2019d built with his hands, while the man himself stood at another bench, sanding the edges of a rocking chair so delicate and graceful, she knew it was meant for a young girl. \u201cDid you build that for Marlee?\u201d</p><p>He looked up, taking off and placing his safety glasses aside. \u201cNo. It\u2019s a gift for Sakura.\u201d</p> <p>It was a kind thing to do for the little girl whose father was not yet totally recovered, the type of thing Walker did so often without fanfare or any expectation of kindness in return. \u201cI brought you something.\u201d Steeling her shoulders, she crossed the space between them to place a mug of coffee and a plate of buttered toast on the bench. It was what he preferred for breakfast. She knew that because she noticed everything about Walker Lauren.</p><p>Putting aside the sander, he dusted off his hands and picked up a piece of toast. Neither of them spoke until he\u2019d finished. \u201cThey\u2019re both skilled individuals,\u201d he said at last. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for anything to go wrong.\u201d</p><p>The knot in her stomach unfurled at the realization that he wasn\u2019t going to make this hard. She was the one who\u2019d walked way . . . but she\u2019d regretted her decision every hour since. She\u2019d missed him. No other man came close to creating the depth of feeling in her that Walker did with a simple look, a simple word.</p><p>Faced with that indisputable conclusion, she\u2019d canceled all future dates. It wasn\u2019t fair. Not to her and not to the males.</p><p>Instead, she\u2019d looked hard at her relationship with Walker\u2014not just what he\u2019d said to her, but what he\u2019d done. Quiet, reserved Walker Lauren, who rarely spoke to anyone, had come to her night after night, trusted her with things she was becoming certain no one else knew. Not only that, but he\u2019d cared for her in that same quiet way. Maybe the words were the truth and his actions an inadvertent lie, but Lara had made the decision to see this through to the end.</p> <p>Never did she want to look back and wonder. Because he mattered. So much. Enough that she was willing to take the biggest risk of her life and continue this friendship that was nothing so simple. \u201cYou\u2019ll worry all the same though,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s your baby brother, and she might as well be your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Pale green eyes widened the tiniest fraction. \u201cJudd would be startled to hear himself described in such a way.\u201d</p><p>Laughing at the unusual show of emotion, she stole a sip of his coffee before passing it over. \u201cI won\u2019t tell if you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d He took a long drink before placing the mug beside the plate and reaching to cup her jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re more rested.\u201d</p><p>Her skin burned where he touched it. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d Running his thumb over her chin, he dropped his hand. \u201cTalk to me.\u201d</p> <p>As he worked, she did exactly that, keeping his mind from dwelling on the truth that two people he loved were in danger. When he touched her now and then, whether it was an accidental brush or a deliberate act as he helped her perch up on the bench, she quelled the urge to demand more.</p><p>This man, he was worth waiting for.</p><p>RECOVERED FROM COMPUTER 2(A) TAGS: PERSONAL CORRESPONDENCE, FATHER, ACTION NOT REQUIRED5</p><p>FROM: Alice &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>TO: Dad &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p> <p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>DATE: March 2nd, 1974 at 10:18pm</p><p>SUBJECT: &lt;no subject&gt;</p><p>Dear Dad,</p><p>My empathic connection came through.

Of course, the Ethics Committee will take forever giving their approval since it\u2019ll involve live volunteers. In the meantime, I plan to continue with my historical research.</p><p>I loved visiting the dig. I miss you both already.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Alice</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>WE HAVE SOMETHING important to finish when you get back.</p><p>Lying flat on the earth on a moonless, starless night far from home, the air thin, the mountains unfamiliar, Sienna kept Hawke\u2019s final words close. He\u2019d kissed her. Held her. Shared an important part of his past. Not only that, but he\u2019d sent her on this mission, accepting that she wasn\u2019t just another young soldier, but an X-Psy honed in the coldest fire.</p><p>Finally, he saw her.</p><p>We were two of the lucky ones\u2014we found each other early.</p><p>Wolves who lost their mates never mated again. It was once, and it was for life. Did it matter? Yes. Maybe it was selfish, but she wanted Hawke to be hers, to see home in her eyes as she saw it in his.</p><p>Time.</p><p>Thoughts switching to martial mode at the psychic alarm, she rose up out of the grass after ensuring the area was clear and made her way on silent feet to the first target. She\u2019d been good at this as Ming\u2019s trainee, but she\u2019d become even better in the years since. With Ming, she\u2019d relied as much as possible on her psychic abilities, while in SnowDancer, she\u2019d had to maintain iron control over those same abilities.</p><p>That discipline came in use tonight.</p><p>She was invisible to the psychic senses of the guards. She knew that because Judd had tested her shields\u2014and been surprised enough by their efficacy to ask her how she\u2019d done it. When she\u2019d shown him, he\u2019d remodulated his own shields to match hers.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t simply because of your X status that Ming took you as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e.</p><p>Corralling the whisper of memory, she completed her task and crossed over to the shadow of the second warehouse to duck into a small recess. A second later, she froze as the sentry turned the corner to head toward her, right on schedule. At least here, she didn\u2019t have to worry about being betrayed by her scent; changelings had a real advantage there.</p><p>It struck her that that might be why Ming was trying to track her. Because though she hadn\u2019t said so to anyone yet, gut instinct kept circling around to the suspicion that it was Ming who\u2019d been behind the four Tks on SnowDancer land, not Henry. Henry had no reason to recognize the distinctive psychic signature of an X. Ming, however, would only need to take a single look at any report to know. He\u2019d consider her a treasure trove of information about the SnowDancers. Which she was.</p><p>Go.</p><p>Moving at the internal command, she slipped out as the sentry disappeared from sight once more, laid the second charge, and was hidden behind another building before he returned. She wanted to telepath Judd, check he was safe, but they\u2019d decided on telepathic silence except in an emergency.</p><p>Being able to detect telepathic communications in progress was so close to impossible that most people accepted it as such. But there were a rare few Psy who could pick up the faint psychic energy exuded during the act. Oddly enough, she\u2019d had her first experience of it with a non-Psy. Lucas apparently had Psy DNA in his ancestry and could always detect psychic activity in his vicinity, telepathic and otherwise.</p><p>Sector 7 complete.</p><p>With that mental note, she shifted to sector 8. Judd had sectors 1 through 6, all more heavily trafficked than the sectors he\u2019d assigned her. It made sense, since he could teleport in and out\u2014plus, he\u2019d been an Arrow. Sienna knew her own strengths. She also knew that Judd could snap her neck and she\u2019d never see it coming.</p><p>Time.</p><p>HAWKE decided to get the hell out of the surveillance room when eventempered Brenna almost snarled, \u201cThey\u2019re maintaining radio silence. We won\u2019t hear anything unless they\u2019re in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Realizing he was agitating her wolf, he touched the back of his hand to her cheek and got out of her way, knowing she\u2019d contact him the instant she had something to report. But there was no way he could sit and wait\u2014shifting into wolf form, he headed out into the cold, clear night. As he ran, greeting his packmates in passing, he considered the information Cooper had sent through earlier that day.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got rumors of weapons moving down into the wider Bay Area.\u201d The lieutenant\u2019s jaw had been a brutal line. \u201cThey\u2019ve learned, Hawke. They\u2019re dodging our regular traps\u2014it fucking frustrates me that we haven\u2019t been able to find or halt a shipment.\u201d</p><p>It frustrated Hawke, too, but part of him had always known this day would come. It wasn\u2019t just the people the Council had lost to the changelings, it was what those defections had done to the perceived power of the Council and of the packs. SnowDancer and DarkRiver were no longer seen as dumb animals but as serious threats.</p><p>Switching direction after passing through Sing-Liu\u2019s patch, the human soldier calling out a hello, Hawke crossed the border into DarkRiver territory. The two packs had free passage over each other\u2019s land, but still, it felt different being away from his own. He was spotted at once since he\u2019d made no attempt to conceal his presence.</p><p>To his surprise, the leopard male who saw him signaled for him to stop. Sides heaving from the run though he could go for miles yet without pausing, Hawke walked to stand a couple of feet from the man. The wolf recognized this male\u2019s scent, identified it as that of Sentinel Clay Bennett.</p><p>\u201cI tried to call you earlier,\u201d Clay said in lieu of a greeting. \u201cThe Rats found something.\u201d</p><p>Hawke cocked his head.</p><p>\u201cWeapons components in the city\u2019s storm water system, so no way to know their exact origin. But,\u201d he added, \u201cRats were able to use a map of the system to figure out that the pieces must\u2019ve come from somewhere around SoMa. Maybe one of the old converted warehouses that have been shut up for maintenance.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hawke\u2019s wolf considered that, permitting the human part of him to come to the forefront. Unlike other changelings who\u2019d let the wolf have control for extended periods, Hawke had never been in danger of losing his humanity. His wolf had taken charge when he\u2019d needed it to as a youth, helping him make decisions the boy had been too young to make, but it had withdrawn as soon as Hawke found his feet.</p><p>The animal had a very black-and-white view of life, didn\u2019t understand the games played in the human world. It understood face-to-face combat, understood killing to survive, to defend. It did not understand killing for political gain. The human, however, had lived through a massacre, comprehended the darkest of motivations all too well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got the Rats doing some more sneaking tonight,\u201d Clay continued.</p> <p>\u201cNo one ever notices them. Tomorrow, I figured we\u2019d meet up, work out a plan for the rest. I\u2019m thinking we should utilize the youngsters\u2014the novices who look like teenagers.\u201d</p><p>Clever, Hawke thought. Teens were universally ignored, they were such a ubiquitous sight in their noisy groups. Giving a crisp nod, he stepped back, leaving the sentinel to his post and allowing his wolf to rise to the surface once more. He saw several more leopards as he went deeper into DarkRiver land. A couple of the youths even ran with him, trying to outpace an alpha. The wolf laughed husky and deep as it let them play before continuing on his way, leaving them winded and tired.</p><p>He covered miles and miles and miles.</p><p>But not for one instant did he forget that Sienna was on the most lethal of playing fields.</p><p>SIENNA tripped. No, no, no!</p> <p>Twisting her body with an awkwardness that went against Indigo\u2019s teachings, she fell hard. Something snapped, and she was pretty certain it was a rib. The pain was a stabbing shock, but she\u2019d evaded the searchlight sweeping over the area.</p><p>Sucking in a quiet, pained breath, she rose and did a quick physical check to confirm she hadn\u2019t injured anything vital. Everything was functional\u2014except that breathing had become difficult. Taking an extra minute and reworking her mental countdown to compensate for it, she divorced the pain from her conscious mind.</p><p>It was a military trick and could prove dangerous if utilized with a severe injury, as the mind would ignore the cues sent by the body\u2014however, it was the perfect solution to a broken rib. That done, she inspected the explosive components in her pack to verify their undamaged state, then continued on her way, silent as a wolf in the forest. She was two steps from the edge of a building that should\u2019ve been empty according to their recon, when everything went wrong.</p><p>The door swung open.</p><p>She froze behind it, unable to see through the metal to the individual on the other side. But she could hear him . . . them.</p><p>\u201cHow many tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFifteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s happening slower than I\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t move too fast or they\u2019ll detect us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A pause. \u201cIt\u2019s reached this point because of the weak ones on the Council.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t have to worry about them much longer.\u201d</p><p>One of the speakers\u2014a tall, black woman\u2014stepped out and began to close the door. Sienna held her breath, so motionless as to be a statue as the door was pulled shut from the inside. The woman checked something on a small organizer, began to turn.</p><p>Another second and she\u2019d see Sienna.</p><p>Throat dry, she flexed her telepathic fingers in anticipation of a strike.</p> <p>HAWKE looked over Brenna\u2019s shoulder the next morning. \u201cTalk to me, sweetheart.\u201d He\u2019d kept his distance after returning from the run, busying himself drafting a list of novices who could work the warehouse district, and briefing them on the task, but it was way past time for Judd and Sienna to have checked in.</p><p>Walker had already confirmed a lack of telepathic communication. \u201cThey\u2019re alive,\u201d he\u2019d said ten minutes ago, fine lines flaring at the corners of his eyes. \u201cI can sense them on the LaurenNet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you chance contacting them through your network?\u201d He didn\u2019t want either Judd or Sienna distracted, but he needed to know if something had gone wrong so the pack could mount a rescue.</p><p>Walker had shaken his head. \u201cThe LaurenNet has limitations because of its size. It can compensate for one of the adults being in a distant location, but with two of them gone, the network is stretched. It\u2019ll hold, but I can\u2019t risk a loss of focus.\u201d</p><p>A breach, Hawke knew, would have catastrophic consequences. \u201cTake care of Toby and Marlee.\u201d That had to be the priority. Neither Sienna nor Judd would want it any different.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know the instant I hear anything. And Hawke?\u201d Pale green eyes holding his. \u201cWe need to talk after they return.\u201d</p><p>Now, in the communications hub of the den, Brenna shook her head in response to his words. \u201cI gave them both untraceable cells, but they might\u2019ve decided not to chance a call anyway.\u201d</p><p>Hawke clenched his hand on the back of her chair. \u201cCan you track them on the airjet?\u201d The two were meant to board a flight home in a few hours.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Brenna pushed her bangs out of her eyes. \u201cWe infected the airport computers with a subtle virus. It erased them from the systems, so it\u2019ll be no use hacking into the visual imaging files.\u201d Releasing a steady breath, she reached back to put her hand over his. \u201cThey\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>Startled by the confidence in her voice, he looked down into her face as she tipped it up. \u201cSo sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried. Of course I\u2019m worried,\u201d she admitted, the darkness in her eyes a silent echo of her words. \u201cBut Judd\u2019s sending me \u2018I\u2019m safe\u2019 vibes through the mating bond.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf scowled, because it couldn\u2019t keep tabs on Sienna that way.</p><p>\u201cPlus,\u201d Brenna continued, \u201cmy mate is a complete badass. Seriously, your girl couldn\u2019t be in better hands.\u201d</p><p>In spite of the wolf pacing within his mind, he felt his lips tug up at the corners. \u201cI\u2019ll have you know, Sienna is a trainee badass.\u201d Accepting that the only thing to do was wait, though such inaction grated, he said, \u201cI\u2019m heading down to talk to the cats about another issue\u2014the instant you hear anything, you call me. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Rising to her feet, she said, \u201cI could do with a hug.\u201d</p><p>He enfolded her in his arms without a word. She was Pack. It soothed something in him to hold her, too. But he knew the wolf would continue to prowl half-mad inside his mind until Sienna was back safe in his territory. \u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He left with a caress to her cheek. Picking up Riley from the cabin the lieutenant shared with Mercy, he drove them both down to the meeting spot, which happened to be the home of the DarkRiver healer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge indication of trust, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Riley said as they came to a stop in front of the graceful split-level home. \u201cTo allow us so close to their healer. We\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d</p><p>Hawke had to agree. \u201cHonestly? I never expected an alliance of any kind with the cats when they first began to make their presence felt.\u201d He\u2019d wanted only that they stay out of his way while he rebuilt his shattered pack.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them made a move to exit the vehicle.</p><p>\u201cHawke,\u201d Riley said into the tense silence, \u201cI can handle this. You don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to be doing something. Might as well be this.\u201d He got out, slamming the door.</p><p>Riley glanced at him when they met at the front of the vehicle. \u201cWord of advice. Strong women don\u2019t take well to being snarled at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough.\u201d She\u2019d be lucky if all he did was snarl at her he thought as he headed into the meeting, his mind on the phone in his pocket.</p><p>When a message did come in, it only said, \u201cStill no contact.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 30</p><p>ADEN LOOKED OVER at the Arrow who stood beside him on the sandy beach along the Amalfi Coast. Abbot was a telekinetic, 9.1 on the Gradient, incredibly powerful, incredibly skilled, incredibly cursed. It had come as no surprise to discover that the twenty-six-year-old was drawn to the idea of Purity.</p><p>\u201cHave you come to stop me, Aden?\u201d the other Arrow asked. \u201cAsk me not to join Pure Psy?\u201d</p><p>Aden shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not Ming, to force you to follow my own political agenda. But you must know\u2014you cannot be both an Arrow and a member of Pure Psy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you would exile me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Abbot. That isn\u2019t who we are.\u201d The water held an edge of luminescence in the dark of the night that had fallen on this side of the world, and he made a note to do some research, find out what sea organism caused the effect. \u201cBut the squad works on unconditional trust.\u201d On the knowledge that the Arrow at his back would never use the position to knife him. \u201cOnce you give your allegiance to Pure Psy, you must follow their goals.\u201d</p><p>Abbot took his time replying, his ink black hair blowing back in the salt laced wind coming off the Gulf of Salerno. \u201cYou\u2019re not a Tk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Vasic say?\u201d</p><p>Aden thought of the Tk-V who could lift blood out of walls and bodies from within graves. \u201cYou should ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo games, Aden. You know his mind\u2014he speaks to you.\u201d</p><p>Aden looked down at the glowing foam before the sea sucked it back in. \u201cVasic believes it doesn\u2019t matter the Councilor at the helm, or whether the machinery is called Council or Purity\u2014in the end, we\u2019re nothing but warm bodies to bleed for them.\u201d So many Arrows had died to protect Silence. Their only reward had been more death.</p><p>\u201cYet we give our allegiance to Kaleb Krychek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are reasons.\u201d</p><p>Abbot looked out toward the lingering golden light in the windows of some of the homes that hugged the cliffs, and Aden saw bleak longing in those eyes as blue as the deepest part of the Aegean. A breach of Silence, but an Arrow never betrayed one of his own. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe are Arrows for a reason,\u201d the other man said at last. \u201cWe cannot survive without Silence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Aden thought of Vasic again, of the price the Tk-V had paid to retain his sanity. \u201cBut perhaps the price of survival has become too high.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 31</p> <p>TEN HOURS AFTER the meeting on DarkRiver land, Hawke had to fight the urge to simultaneously pull Sienna to his chest and strangle Judd. The two of them walked into the den after having finally checked in by phone when they landed in San Francisco\u2014six hours behind schedule. He did neither.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell,\u201d he said the instant the office door was shut, \u201cdid you not tag Walker with a telepathic report?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a situation,\u201d Judd said, making Hawke\u2019s blood run cold. \u201cI had to do a fast teleport to get Sienna out of a tight spot. Combined with the teleport in and out of the village for both of us, as well as what was necessary to complete the op, it brought me close to flaming out.\u201d</p><p>Eyes on Sienna, Hawke said, \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>She drew up her spine. \u201cSince Judd was effectively drained, we made the decision to conserve my psychic energy. A long-distance telepathic report would\u2019ve only utilized a small amount of power, but that may have counted in a confrontation.\u201d</p> <p>Heart an ice-cold block in his chest as he read between the lines, Hawke nodded at Judd to continue.</p><p>\u201cWe missed our scheduled flight because I needed time to recover enough that there was no chance of a collapse.\u201d Judd carried on when Hawke didn\u2019t interrupt. \u201cThe charges have been placed. Brenna can activate any or all of them from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave her build two remotes as well\u2014I\u2019ll carry one, you take the spare,\u201d Hawke ordered. \u201cWe need to be prepared in case we have to abandon the den.\u201d</p><p>Judd\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cHas that ever happened?\u201d</p><p>Hawke gave a curt nod. \u201cOnce. The location had been leaked.\u201d As a lieutenant, Hawke\u2019s father had known too much when he\u2019d been compromised.</p><p>The only reason SnowDancer had managed to reclaim the den was that the men and women who\u2019d been left after the blood and death had gone out and quietly executed the small group behind the psychic rapes. No one had ever connected the deaths to SnowDancer, a deliberate choice on the pack\u2019s part. They\u2019d been too weak to chance a Psy reprisal. But they were no longer weak, no longer broken. \u201cTell Brenna the remotes are a priority.\u201d</p> <p>Judd nodded. \u201cWe also captured detailed images of the camp with the cameras hooked into our collars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMariska can clean up and summarize the footage.\u201d The twenty-eighty-ear-old senior tech was so shy she appeared standoffish, but had a mind like a scalpel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drop it off to her. If you haven\u2019t got any more questions, we should get changed and try to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom the way Brenna kissed you at the entrance, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be doing much resting,\u201d Hawke said, and saw Sienna\u2019s lips tug upward a tiny fraction.</p><p>Judd, on the other hand, showed no physical reaction. \u201cGoodnight, Hawke.\u201d Cool, very Psy, very Judd. \u201cSienna, you should get to bed, too.\u201d</p><p>Sienna glanced up, expecting Hawke to stop her, but he\u2019d already turned away to look at something else on his desk. Deflated, she exited with Judd.</p><p>\u201cSienna,\u201d he said, halting her when they would\u2019ve split two corridors later, \u201cyou did very well.\u201d</p><p>Her shoulders went tight at the memory of that instant before the guard had been distracted by a call. It had given Judd the time to answer her telepathic hail and \u2019port her out. \u201cI could\u2019ve gotten us both caught.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThings happen in the field\u2014the mark of a good operative is how you respond to the challenge. You stayed composed and silent, the right course of action given the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>It felt good to hear that. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s your rib?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Judd hadn\u2019t mentioned it to Hawke, but the work he\u2019d done to knit the bone was the real reason he\u2019d been so wiped out. She\u2019d been hurt worse than she\u2019d thought. \u201cDoesn\u2019t even feel bruised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Leaning over, he pressed his lips to her temple. \u201cGo shower. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be having a visitor in another ten minutes, at the absolute maximum.\u201d His tone was so even, it took an instant for the words to penetrate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll attempt,\u201d he added, \u201cnot to \u2019port in and break his legs for having the gall to be in your room.\u201d</p><p>She stared, stunned, after he stalked off.</p><p>Ten minutes, at the absolute maximum.</p><p>Jolted to action by the mental echo, she ran to her room, dodging any attempts by packmates to stop her. The instant she closed the door behind herself, she stripped and jumped into the shower.</p><p>She was rubbing the towel over her wet body when there was a hard knock on the door.</p><p>Definitely not ten minutes.</p><p>More like four and a half.</p><p>\u201cJust a second!\u201d Grabbing her dirty clothes\u2014scattered all over the floor\u2014she threw them into the bathroom, then raced to pull on underwear.</p><p>The knock came again, more impatient.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d</p><p>Her jeans hooked on her ankles. Cursing, she managed to get them on and struggled into a forest green T-shirt, pulling her damp hair out from under the back as, breathless, she opened the door partway through the third knock. \u201cWha\u2014\u201d</p><p>The door was closed, and she was pressed up against the solid mass of it before she knew what was happening. \u201cHawke, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>His hands cupped her face, the wolf looking out of his eyes. Her words faded away, her heartbeat accelerated, and still he continued to watch her with that complete and unwavering focus. When his thumb moved over her cheekbone, she jumped.</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d he said in a quiet, quiet tone, \u201cwill not send you into a hot zone again.\u201d</p><p>So easy, it would be so easy to let the overwhelming power of him take her over. \u201cYou must.\u201d Her voice came out husky. \u201cI was born for war.\u201d</p><p>One hand stroked down, over her jaw, to collar her throat. \u201cNo.\u201d A single word spoken in a warm rush of air against her skin, his body aligned to hers.</p><p>\u201cI am what I am.\u201d It was hard to continue speaking when he was so very hot and beautiful against her, the maleness of him a living caress. \u201cFire contained in a small box die\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s mouth stole her words, the taste of him a blast to the senses. This kiss was unlike any of the others. Moving the hand on her throat to cup her jaw, he angled her head just the way he liked, pressed his free hand to the door beside her head, kicked her legs farther apart . . . and then he took her.</p><p>Hot and wet and open-mouthed, it was a devouring kind of kiss, the kind of kiss that made it plain he considered her his.</p><p>Sienna shuddered. He was so big, so gorgeous, so close that her hands didn\u2019t know where to land. Gripping at the back of his black shirt, she tried to make herself taller, to offer up more of her mouth, taste more of his.</p><p>A growl rumbled out of his chest as she moved her body, and she realized that somehow, she was riding his thigh. Another time, it might have embarrassed or shocked her, but tonight . . .</p><p>More, she thought, give me everything. She might never hold all of him, but this she would claim. His lost mate had never touched this wild, hungry part of him, never caressed the powerful body that pinned her against the door, never tasted the dark heat of that demanding mouth. This fire between them, it was for her and her alone.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing a bra?\u201d</p><p>Shocked by the rough question against her lips, she sucked in a gasping breath. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give me time.\u201d</p><p>A wolfish smile. Kisses over her jaw, along her neck. She braced herself for a bite, but it didn\u2019t come. Instead, he slid his hand down to her lower back and nudged her more firmly onto his thigh. She couldn\u2019t help the whimper that escaped her throat.</p><p>Yes, she knew about sex\u2014quite aside from her clinical lessons in health studies, the women\u2019s magazines in the novices\u2019 common room had proven extremely instructive. But no amount of research could\u2019ve prepared her for this. Never had she understood what it would be to be so very, very close to him, the muscled strength of him rubbing against her most intimate place.</p><p>\u201cSuch big eyes.\u201d That was when she felt teeth.</p><p>On her lower lip. A slow, sexy bite that dared her to retaliate. Shifting her hold to around his neck, she clenched her fingers in the thick silk of his hair and arched up to claim his mouth. She was Psy, her mind her greatest asset\u2014she\u2019d made note of what he liked without realizing it, used the data, and was gratified at the growl that rolled into her mouth . . . vibrated against the stiff peaks of her nipples.</p><p>Jerking back, she looked down at the soft cotton of her T-shirt. And wondered what it would feel like if they were skin to skin.</p><p>But Hawke hadn\u2019t had enough of the kiss. Tugging her back with a grip in her hair, he reclaimed her mouth. Darkly intense, a searing brand. His free hand stroked down to grip her thigh as he urged her to move on him. \u201cThat\u2019s it, beautiful.\u201d Husky words against her lips as her body began rubbing against his without her conscious control, a tight kind of need unfurling in her abdomen.</p><p>More kisses, strokes along her thigh. \u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d She obeyed because she didn\u2019t want him to pull away, to leave her bereft when she could almost taste\u2014</p><p>The seam of her jeans pressed onto her clitoris and everything fractured. Even the agonizing pain of the second level of dissonance wasn\u2019t enough to blunt the impact.</p><p>HAWKE saw the flickers of dangerous red and lethal yellow out of the corner of his eye, plastered his body to hers. \u201cBaby, you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014what?\u201d A dazed sounding question. \u201cHurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the fire touch you?\u201d Reaching down, he stroked her hair off her face.</p><p>Huge obsidian eyes looked up at him, devoid of the stars that denoted a cardinal. \u201cOnly inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe fire only touched me inside.\u201d</p><p>Figuring out what she was talking about, he grinned, then took mental inventory of his own body. No burns. \u201cInteresting,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Something in his voice\u2014likely the smug arrogance\u2014had her blinking, trying to come back. He didn\u2019t want her thinking coherently yet. She was all loose and sated right now, and he wanted nothing more than to hold her, to pet her as he wished. Shifting before she could stop him, he sat down on her bed with her cuddled into him. \u201cYou sure got a quick trigger, Sienna,\u201d he teased, in control for the simple reason that she was in his arms, under his protection again.</p> <p>A solemn look. \u201cIs that bad?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help it. He kissed her, indulging himself in the vibrant life of her. She wasn\u2019t dead in some Pure Psy camp, hadn\u2019t come back bloody and broken. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cI like making you come. I plan to do it often and well.\u201d</p><p>Color swept up on a red tide over her face, and she pressed it down against his chest. So young, he thought, feeling the raking claw of conscience. But he was no hypocrite. He\u2019d sent her into an enemy camp, sent her into a situation that could\u2019ve resulted in death. If she was old enough to die for the pack, she was old enough to choose who she wanted as a lover. \u201cTell me,\u201d he said, weaving his fingers through her damp hair, \u201cabout the operation.\u201d</p><p>Instead of pointing out that Judd had already done so, she gave him a step-by-step debrief. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t tell you the next fact because it puts me in a lesser bargaining position,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I was scared.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her thigh. \u201cI\u2019d be more worried if you hadn\u2019t been\u2014fear keeps us alive, keeps us alert.\u201d Now if he\u2019d just listen to himself instead of feeling a feral anger at the idea of her afraid and alone in the dark.</p> <p>Sienna sat up, one hand braced on his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. Arrows feel no fear, and that makes them strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he agreed. \u201cBut an Arrow won\u2019t have a kiss waiting for him at the end of a hunt, no warm body next to him when a nightmare strikes.\u201d</p><p>A steady look\u2014no longer that of the girl who\u2019d blushed, but of the woman who had taken him on more than once. \u201cHawke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d</p><p>He curled a strand of ruby red around his finger. \u201cIt means you have to learn to deal with me.\u201d There was no going back. Not from this.</p> <p>Furrows on her brow. \u201cPerhaps you should learn to deal with me instead.\u201d</p><p>His wolf bared its teeth in a feral grin. \u201cBaby, I\u2019ve been trying to master that trick since the day I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar,\u201d she said. \u201cYour wolf thinks it can control me.\u201d A shift of her lower body as she got more comfortable.</p><p>He hissed out a breath. \u201cEasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re aroused.\u201d Such a cool statement, but he could scent the earthy warmth of the damp heat between her legs, hear the rising pulse of her heartbeat.</p><p>Leaning forward, he nuzzled at her throat, licking up the salt and spice of her. \u201cI can handle it.\u201d His wolf had had a taste, was starving for more, but it understood that to claim her to the deepest level, man and wolf both would have to move carefully. Neither part of him ever wanted to see fear in her eyes when she looked at him, especially in bed.</p><p>SHIVERING against the impact of those slow, wolfish licks, Sienna clenched her hand in Hawke\u2019s hair. \u201cYour hair is beautiful. You know it, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She felt his lips curve against the sensitive skin of her neck before he nipped at her. Jerking, she curled her other arm tighter around him, her cheek pressed against the abrasive stubble of his. Then she did what she\u2019d wanted to do for so long. She petted him, stroking her fingers through the heavy strands of silver-gold until he relaxed . . . and switched their positions so she found herself flat on her back with him stretched out on top of her, his weight braced on his forearms.</p> <p>For a second, she halted in her caresses, overwhelmed by the sheer, wild masculinity of the wolf in her bed. He growled low in his throat . . . and her skin stretched tight over her body. Sucking in a breath, she began to pet him again, this gorgeous, powerful man who wore his wolf so very close to the surface. One of his own hands settled on her hip, heavy and warm and possessive.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it like?\u201d she dared ask. \u201cTo have the wolf in charge while you were in your human skin as a teenager?\u201d</p><p>Nudging her legs apart, he settled more heavily against her. \u201cIt just was.\u201d A very wolf-like answer. \u201cThe wolf sees in black or white, no shades of gray. At that time, that was what was needed.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he continued, surprising her with his willingness to talk, \u201cI was always present. The wolf didn\u2019t truly take over, so much as allow the boy to borrow its strength for a while.\u201d</p><p>Sienna parted her lips to ask about the Psy, what they\u2019d done to SnowDancer, closed them before the words could escape. That darkness had no place here, no place in this room, in this bed. Instead, she continued to stroke him, not realizing until several minutes later that her own body had relaxed under his, one leg raised at the knee to press against his side.</p><p>Smart wolf.</p><p>He began to kiss the sensitive slope of her neck again, slow and wet and a little rough.</p><p>Sexy wolf.</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>HAWKE\u2019S WOLF WAS drunk on the taste of Sienna, on the scent of her, but it halted, clawed at the human half until it paid attention. Raising his head from her neck, he shook it, trying to find a glimmer of rational thought.</p><p>\u201cHawke?\u201d Sienna\u2019s hands stroked up his nape and into his hair, the spot so sensitive that had he been a cat, he would\u2019ve purred. \u201cWhy did you stop?\u201d</p><p>It was the answer to his own confusion, putting the wolf\u2019s hesitation into words. \u201cBecause,\u201d he murmured, pressing an open-mouthed kiss to the hollow of her throat, \u201cyou\u2019re tired on both the physical and psychic levels.\u201d His need for her was a wild thing, but for her first time, she deserved better than a frantic coupling.</p><p>Scowling, she tugged at his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t need you to make that decision for me.\u201d</p><p>He settled his lower body flush against her, growled in satisfaction when she made a hot little sound in the back of her throat. \u201cI need to make this decision for me.\u201d No regrets, that\u2019s what he wanted to see in her passion flushed face after their first time together.</p><p>Fingers going motionless, she searched his eyes. \u201cAll right.\u201d It was a solemn whisper, as if she\u2019d read his thoughts. \u201cKiss me before you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby\u201d\u2014a nip of that lush lower lip\u2014\u201cI have plans to do a lot more than that.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t take her, not tonight, but neither was he noble enough to walk away without indulging himself with a long, deep taste.</p><p>Her nails dug into his nape. \u201cHow far?\u201d</p><p>So serious. It turned his wolf playful. \u201cI intend to get to second base.\u201d</p><p>When her chest rose up in a jagged breath, he knew full well she understood the sexual reference. \u201cWhat\u2019s second base on a man?\u201d</p><p>Blinking, he raised his head, having never had cause to consider that question. \u201cThe same, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen take off your shirt.\u201d She undid the first button, went for the second.</p><p>A hundred images flashed into his mind, all of them involving the sweet heat of her breasts rubbing against his bare chest. Gritting his teeth, he grabbed her hands in one of his and pinned them above her head. \u201cNo touching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawke\u2014\u201d</p><p>Kissing the complaint off her lips, he slipped his hand under her T-shirt to spread his fingers over the taut silk of her abdomen. Her skin quivered as he moved that hand up to settle over her ribs, her heartbeat jagged under his skin. \u201cYes?\u201d he whispered, nuzzling a kiss to the tender spot beneath her ear. \u201cIt\u2019ll feel so good.\u201d For both of them.</p><p>Her wrists flexed in his grip, but she didn\u2019t attempt to pull away. \u201cYes.\u201d Husky acquiescence.</p><p>Lifting his head from the intoxication of her skin, he held her gaze as he moved his hand up just enough to brush his thumb along the underside of her breast. She came up off the bed, pushing her soft flesh into his touch. Shuddering, he cupped her, squeezed her, rolled her nipple between his fingertips to her restless movements, her erotic cries. His mouth watered to push up her T-shirt, taste the hard little nub.</p><p>It took every ounce of will he had not to reach down, undo the damn zipper on his jeans and put her fingers on him. Patience. Patience. He chanted the word at the back of his mind as he moved his hand to her neglected breast, as he petted her to piercing need . . . and found he was rocking his cock against the feminine arousal he could taste so earthy and rich on his tongue.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Sienna stared up in disbelief as he jerked up and out of the bed. Her nipples peaked against the soft cotton of her T-shirt, taunting him. \u201cYou can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave you hot and frustrated?\u201d Leaning down with his hands braced on either side of her, he closed his teeth over one provocative nub, wetting the cloth with his tongue. Her cry was sharp, her arousal a lash against his senses. \u201cI damn well can,\u201d he said, raising his head, \u201cwhen my cock is about to break in half.\u201d</p><p>Chest rising and falling as she gulped in air, she shook her head. \u201cNot my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll your fault.\u201d Not daring another kiss, he cupped her jaw, stroked his thumb over her lower lip. \u201cDamn, but I like making out with you Sienna. Let\u2019s do it again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He left to the sound of a feminine snarl. It made his lips curve into a feral smile.</p><p>SASCHA was in the large, comfortable chair in the living room, Nadiya in her arms when Lucas stepped out for a second. He walked back in with an envelope in his hand. \u201cKit said this was delivered to the office by courier earlier today. Addressed to both of us.\u201d</p><p>Smiling at the thought of the youth who was growing into a strong, wonderful man in front of her eyes, she said, \u201cHas he gone?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A nod. \u201cHe had a perimeter shift, but he\u2019s going to drop by in the morning before he heads home. Not to see either of us, of course.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she watched Lucas tear open the letter, scan it. His own grin faded. \u201cAccording to this,\u201d he said, \u201can anonymous benefactor has opened a trust fund worth five million dollars in Naya\u2019s name for her education, the balance to be paid out when she\u2019s twenty-five.\u201d</p><p>Sascha let Naya grip her finger as their little cat yawned, settled back down to nap some more. \u201cMother.\u201d</p> <p>Placing the letter on the coffee table, Lucas said, \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>She loved him so much, but it was at moments like this that it struck her how very lucky she was. So many men would\u2019ve rejected the trust fund out of hand, never asking the why of it all. \u201cI\u2019ve come to realize that I don\u2019t know my mother as well as I thought I did.\u201d It had changed her perception of her childhood, forced her to view everything through a different lens. \u201cLet me talk to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to put Naya down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just want to go cuddle with her.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t deny the charge as he took the drowsy newborn from Sascha, his lips curving in the most tender of smiles. Fatherhood suited her panther\u2014though she knew she\u2019d have to watch out for his overprotective tendencies or poor Naya would never go on a single date. A quiet laugh bubbled out of her. It delighted her to think of the future, of all they\u2019d experience together as a family.</p> <p>Following her mate into the bedroom, she watched as he settled down on the bed with Naya skin to skin on his chest. His hand all but covered her tiny body as he stroked her in that changeling way, bonding with her on the most elemental level. Then he purred, and Naya made a happy little sound of delight, very much a cat in her love of touch.</p><p>Sascha laughed at the sight of the two of them so contented and lazy. \u201cRoom enough for three?\u201d</p><p>Lucas held out his arm, eyes panther-green. \u201cAlways and forever.\u201d</p><p>He stopped her heart sometimes, this man. \u201cDon\u2019t make me cry. I\u2019m still hormonal.\u201d Cuddling next to him when he smiled, she reached for the cell phone on the bedside table. It took a bare few seconds to send the text message. Nikita answered using Tp an instant later, her reach long enough that she\u2019d hear Sascha\u2019s far weaker telepathic voice.</p><p>Sascha.</p><p>Mother, we\u2019ve received the letter advising us of the trust fund.</p> <p>What does that have to do with me?</p><p>Her mother lied, Sascha thought, with such effortless ease. Instead of forcing the issue, she said, You know I \u2019ve given birth?</p><p>Your child carries a Russian first name. I expected you to sever all ties with your past.</p><p>Sascha had considered that, but she carried the past within her. The echo of it would resonate to her child, if only in the fierceness of the love Sascha felt for her. Lucas and I decided it was important for Nadiya to know both parts of her heritage. The line of Slavic monikers went back to Sascha\u2019s grandfather, while Naya\u2019s middle name had been that of Lucas\u2019s healer mother. Would you like me to e-mail you an image of her?</p><p>We cut our familial ties, Sascha. A statement so cold, it was beyond cruel. She means nothing to me.</p><p>Once, the words would\u2019ve made her bleed. Now, Sascha saw the truth buried beneath the lie. No, of course not. Because if Nikita acknowledged Nadiya as her grandchild, the baby became a target. Mother, the trust fund\u2014</p><p>Is a private matter in which I bear no interest.</p><p>A single tear trickled down Sascha\u2019s cheek. All right.</p> <p>The telepathic connection ended in silence.</p><p>\u201cSascha.\u201d Lucas\u2019s arm curled around her chest to hold her against his side, the tension in him communicating itself through the mating bond. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing hurtful.\u201d Turning, she rubbed her face against his chest as she watched Naya\u2019s fragile body rise and fall in innocent sleep. \u201cI\u2019m a mother now, Lucas. I would do anything to keep Naya safe, even if it meant she would hate me for the rest of her life.\u201d Swallowing, she touched a finger to their baby\u2019s plump cheek. \u201cIt makes me wonder if that isn\u2019t exactly what Nikita did.\u201d</p><p>STILL able to feel the canvas of Sienna\u2019s body against his own the next afternoon, and wondering why the hell he\u2019d given in to his good side and stopped, Hawke finished clearing the decks. He and Kenji had had an interesting conversation with the BlackSea Coalition this morning, and the lieutenant was following up on the details.</p><p>In Los Angeles, Jem was doing the same with Aquarius. Shooting back a reply to an e-mail she\u2019d sent, he checked the other things on his mental list. The novice teams were scoping out the warehouse district, Brenna was building the remotes, while Mariska and Judd were going over video footage. Riley had the rotation of soldiers in hand, Indigo and Riaz the newly revised training schedule.</p><p>Finding Lara, he got an update on everyone who\u2019d been injured in the attack. Simran was almost recovered and resting at home, as was Riordan. Elias, however, remained in the infirmary. \u201cI almost broke a scanner over his head today,\u201d Lara muttered. \u201cNever knew it would be Eli who drove me to drink.\u201d</p><p>Hawke grinned. \u201cSo he\u2019s on the way to being healed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A faint smile. \u201cI have to keep him here because his new skin is so fragile, but he\u2019ll walk out with no scars in less than a week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do good work, Lara.\u201d He kissed her on the cheek, then popped in to see Riley.</p><p>\u201cNo one else needs you today,\u201d the lieutenant said and pointed to the door. \u201cTake advantage of it while you can.\u201d</p><p>Doing exactly that, Hawke went tracking his favorite prey. \u201cToby,\u201d he said, catching the young boy as he ran outside with a soccer ball in his arms, school having let out half an hour earlier. \u201cHave you seen Sienna?\u201d</p><p>Toby shook his head, his hair\u2014not yet as dark a red as Sienna\u2019s\u2014getting into his eyes. Hawke narrowed his own eyes. \u201cWhen was the last time you had a haircut?\u201d</p><p>Pushing back the strands, Toby shifted from foot to foot, his face flaming a shade perilously close to that of his hair. \u201cUm . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby.\u201d Never before had Hawke needed to use that tone with the preteen who was so well-behaved, it left his wolf a bit bemused.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like scissors,\u201d Toby blurted out. \u201cNear my head, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalker\u2019s okay with this?\u201d The Psy male wasn\u2019t the type to let things slide.</p><p>\u201cSienna kind of got me out of it.\u201d</p><p>That, Hawke understood. Sienna was fierce in her protectiveness when it came to Toby. Maybe too much so. Hawke understood taking care of those who were his own, but he also understood that a boy needed to explore and be proud of his own strength. \u201cCome on, you\u2019re having a haircut today,\u201d he said, shifting his priorities because no matter the searing depth of his need to see Sienna, this young member of his pack needed him. \u201cHow can you get anything done if you can\u2019t see?\u201d</p><p>Toby dragged his feet, but he obeyed. Hawke had him dump the soccer ball in the backseat of the truck as he started it up.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see Sascha.\u201d His wolf\u2019s curiosity about the baby was too strong for him to wait any longer, and he knew the empath would be happy to tidy up Toby\u2019s hair.</p><p>Except Toby went stiff at the idea, the scent of his distress slapping against Hawke. Stopping the truck at once, he reached out to rub the kid\u2019s down-bent head. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like Sascha. A lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d That\u2019s why he\u2019d figured the whole haircut deal would go down better with the empath\u2019s help.</p><p>Fisted hands on tense thighs. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to think I\u2019m a baby.\u201d</p><p>Oh. \u201cSame with Riley?\u201d The kid worshipped the lieutenant, who treated him like a much younger brother.</p><p>Toby\u2019s nod was hard and fast.</p><p>\u201cHmm. In that case, I\u2019ll have to do it.\u201d Driving to park the car deeper in their territory\u2014and aware of Toby gaping at him\u2014he had the boy get out, then rummaged around in the storage well until he found a pair of scissors in the first-aid kit. When Toby gulped, he pointed to the bed of the truck and said, \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>The boy clambered up onto the tailgate, legs hanging off the edge and words tumbling out at high speed. \u201cMy mom used to use Tp to make me sleep when I had a haircut. I never liked it.\u201d</p><p>Happy to hear that the fear was a harmless remnant of childhood, not based on hidden trauma, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re not using the sedatives in the first-aid kit, so forget about it.\u201d</p><p>Toby\u2019s face fell. \u201cThose look really sharp.\u201d</p><p>Reaching up, Hawke snipped off a bit of his own hair to test the blades. \u201cYeah, should do the trick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-oh.\u201d Huge cardinal eyes. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Cause every time you cut your hair, Sienna gets mad.\u201d</p><p>His wolf pricked up its ears. \u201cYeah?\u201d He stepped closer.</p><p>Toby froze.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Hawke said, having had enough experience with pups to understand logic wouldn\u2019t help right now, \u201cclose your eyes and scream as loud as you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust do it.\u201d</p><p>Toby took a deep breath, scrunched his eyes closed . . . and screamed.</p><p>Wincing at the earsplitting volley of sound, Hawke snipped off the boy\u2019s far too long bangs in one cut, making sure not to touch the metallic blades to the kid\u2019s skin. \u201cNot bad.\u201d It wasn\u2019t crooked in any case.</p><p>Toby\u2019s eyes snapped open. \u201cDid you do it?\u201d</p><p>Hawke handed him his hair. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone else will let me scream.\u201d A pensive statement.</p><p>\u201cWell, as long as you don\u2019t mind looking like a prison escapee, I can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Toby beamed.</p><p>\u201cHow about the bottom?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYours is longer than mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can leave it that length on the condition it doesn\u2019t get in your way.\u201d</p><p>Toby frowned, considered. Serious little man, Hawke thought, realizing he hadn\u2019t spent that much time with the boy. But man and wolf both liked him\u2014Toby had a simple and deep kindness to him that Hawke knew would never disappear. The last vestiges of childhood fears aside, there was strength there, too. Hesitant yet, still growing, but when Toby came into his own, he\u2019d make the pack proud, of that Hawke had not a single doubt.</p> <p>\u201cCut it.\u201d A decisive statement. \u201cI can have it longer after I pass my outdoor lessons.\u201d</p><p>Hawke was impressed. \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>A strong nod. Then Toby closed his eyes, inhaled. It took three screams and by the last one, Toby was laughing. So was Hawke. They sat on the tailgate afterward, eating peanuts from a bag Toby had had in his pocket. The nuts were crushed, but that didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Hawke found himself reevaluating his opinion of the boy as they talked. Toby had the gentleness of an empath, but he saw everything\u2014and he understood that the world wasn\u2019t always kind. Who better, after all, to know the dark side of the human heart than someone gifted with the ability to sense emotion?</p><p>But he was also a child.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thirsty,\u201d he said after crunching the last peanut.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Turning around, Hawke hunted through the first-aid kit and came up with a bottle of water. \u201cAha.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to replace that or Lara will tell you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I know it.\u201d Taking a gulp from the bottle, he passed it to Toby.</p><p>Who copied his actions.</p><p>Hiding his grin, he grabbed the soccer ball. \u201cCome on, squirt.\u201d</p> <p>Toby\u2019s face beamed. \u201cReally? Me and you?\u201d</p><p>Hawke played the ball over his foot. \u201cMove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d</p><p>They spent over a half hour together, with Toby proving to be both nimble and intelligent as an opponent. Afterward, they finished off the bottle of water before getting back into the truck.</p><p>Toby did up his safety belt. \u201cHow come you didn\u2019t ask me stuff about Sienna?\u201d</p><p>Hawke raised an eyebrow as he started the vehicle.</p><p>Toby shrugged. \u201cI figured you were spending time with me to find out about my sister.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, the kid saw everything. \u201cMaybe I thought about it,\u201d Hawke said, because he didn\u2019t believe in lying to his pack. \u201cBut turns out I like hanging out with you.\u201d</p> <p>Toby\u2019s whole face lit up. \u201cYou mean it. I know.\u201d</p><p>Mussing the kid\u2019s hair, Hawke drove him home. He went with Toby to the practice field to ensure the boy\u2019s coach was aware Toby hadn\u2019t played hookey, and the kids begged him to stay. He was alpha. Caring for pups was instinctive. As a result, night had fallen by the time he was able to go after Sienna again.</p><p>And this time, nothing was going to keep him from his prey.</p><p>RECOVERED FROM COMPUTER 2(A) TAGS: PERSONAL CORRESPONDENCE, FATHER, ACTION NOT REQUIRED</p><p>FROM: Alice &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>TO: Dad &lt;</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>/* */ &gt;</p><p>DATE: November 12th, 1974 at 11:04pm</p><p>SUBJECT: &lt;no subject&gt;</p><p>Dear Dad,</p><p>I received a notice today terminating my access to the X-designation volunteers and \u201crequesting\u201d I cease my research.

The telepath jerked his head toward the corridor. Realizing the eldest of the Laurens wanted to have this conversation away from the kids, Hawke led them to a small, private alcove before saying, \u201cI\u2019m surprised you waited this long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a time and a place. This would be it.\u201d Holding Hawke\u2019s gaze in a way that not many men could, Walker said, \u201cYou will be good to her.\u201d Not a statement, but an order.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf stirred. \u201cDo you think I\u2019d be otherwise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I did, you\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p><p>It was Judd who\u2019d been the assassin, but Hawke had the sudden, crystal-clear realization that when it came to Sienna, Toby, and Marlee, it was Walker who was more dangerous. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d If he had a daughter, he\u2019d kill any man who dared hurt her. And whatever their actual relationship, Walker was the closest Sienna had to a father.</p><p>She\u2019d said as much to him when he\u2019d asked about her father as they danced that night in the training room.</p><p>\u201cI know his identity, but per the reproduction contract, his only involvement in my life\u2014and Toby\u2019s\u2014was biological.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever feel the need to track him down, demand more?\u201d he\u2019d asked, unable to comprehend how a man could walk away from his children.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think Toby has either.\u201d There\u2019d been no emotional distress in her tone, her next words explaining why. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had Walker, you see.\u201d</p><p>Now Walker gave a clipped nod. \u201cThen we\u2019re clear.\u201d Turning on his heel, he walked back to his quarters.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf shook its head, staring after the Psy male with pale green eyes. \u201cYou told me you were a teacher in the Net.\u201d</p><p>The man looked over his shoulder. \u201cI was. You never asked me who I taught.\u201d The door closed.</p><p>Deciding that conversation could wait, because whatever he\u2019d been, Walker was now loyal to the pack, Hawke continued on his search. Sienna wasn\u2019t hanging out in the common areas. He checked Lara\u2019s domain next, discovered she\u2019d been in an hour earlier. Starting to lose his temper, he shoved into his own place to grab a bite to eat before resuming the hunt.</p><p>The scent of autumn and spice in the air, in his every breath.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me a game,\u201d Sienna said, picking up a card from the deck she\u2019d placed on the carpeted floor of the front room of his quarters. Dressed in jeans and that sexy-as-sin black shirt with those tempting snap buttons, she sat cross-legged on the carpet, her hair a sheet of dark fire licking down her back.</p><p>His wolf growled, bad-tempered because she\u2019d outwitted him. \u201cHow did you get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like you lock your door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, because people don\u2019t waltz into an alpha\u2019s quarters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, punish me.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d expected challenge, was caught by the wickedness. His wolf came to attention. \u201cI might just do that,\u201d he said, prowling over to crouch down and nip at her lower lip.</p><p>A tremor silvered over her skin. \u201cIs that it?\u201d</p><p>Satisfying as it would\u2019ve been to gorge, he decided to eat her up in small, luscious bites tonight. \u201cFor now.\u201d Rising, he went into the compact galley and threw together a plate. \u201cHave you had dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Coming down to sit across from her, he fed her a plump grape anyway. As her lips closed on the ripe fruit, his wolf watched, fascinated. \u201cPoker,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d A husky answer.</p><p>He ate half a sandwich before speaking. \u201cWe have to have stakes.\u201d</p><p>Lines on her forehead. \u201cFor credits, you mean?\u201d</p><p>Poor innocent baby, about to get fleeced. \u201cTut-tut, gorgeous. You know when you play poker with a man behind closed doors, there is only one acceptable currency.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cYou\u2019d play for that?\u201d</p><p>Enjoying shocking cool and collected Sienna, he took his time eating the other half of the sandwich. \u201cClothes, Ms. Lauren. What did you think I was talking about?\u201d</p><p>She blew out a breath between gritted teeth. \u201cSometimes I really want to\u201d\u2014a frustrated sound\u2014\u201cbite you!\u201d</p><p>He froze. \u201cI might let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t do it if you\u2019d enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>Bad tempered thing. His wolf liked that about her. \u201cLet\u2019s play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might not be Silent any longer, but I still have the perfect poker face.\u201d A smug smile.</p><p>It stayed on her face as she divested him of his socks\u2014he\u2019d kicked his shoes off earlier\u2014his shirt, and his belt. That was when her concentration began to falter, her eyes flicking over his chest and back. Again. And again.</p><p>The wolf arched its back, preening for her.</p><p>And Hawke stopped playing nice.</p><p>SIENNA had seen Hawke unclothed before\u2014it was impossible not to catch such glimpses since changelings came out of a shift naked, but pack protocol meant she\u2019d always forced herself to look away. Even if she hadn\u2019t, those times, she\u2019d been nowhere near this close.</p><p>His chest was taut with muscle, his abs washboard flat, his skin a warm, strokable honey lightly furred with silver-gold. She wanted to press him to the carpet and lick him all over.</p><p>\u201cYou planning to fold?\u201d</p><p>She jerked up her head, almost dropping her cards. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to show your cards.\u201d</p><p>Certain she had him beat, she laid out her spread. \u201cFull house.\u201d Her eyes went to his jeans.</p><p>She was so busy imagining him naked, she almost missed the smile that flirted over his lips as he said, \u201cNice, but not good enough,\u201d and fanned out a royal flush.</p><p>Stunned, she stared.</p><p>\u201cStrip, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She went to pull off her socks, her skin shimmering from the impact of that verbal caress.</p><p>\u201cNu-huh.\u201d A shake of his head. \u201cShirt.\u201d</p><p>That snapped through the sensual fog. \u201cBut I let you take off your socks first!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t know you had a foot fetish. Shirt.\u201d</p><p>She glared.</p><p>\u201cYou reneging on the bet?\u201d</p> <p>Fuming, she began to unsnap the buttons of the black shirt.</p><p>Hawke watched her with predatory alertness. \u201cYou\u2019ll be cute dressed in just your socks.\u201d</p><p>The image made her fingers halt on the final buttons, but when he raised his eyebrows, she kicked herself back into gear, shrugging off the shirt before she could lose her nerve.</p><p>His groan made her thighs clench. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing a fricking tank top underneath!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrustration\u2019s not so funny now, is it?\u201d she said with a smirk.</p> <p>A slow smile that made her stomach go twisty and tight. \u201cSo this is revenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Her satisfaction lasted until she figured out that Hawke was a cardsharp. Heart in her mouth, she was certain he\u2019d make her strip off the despised tank next, but he rubbed his jaw and said, \u201cTank with the socks\u2014could be cute.\u201d</p><p>Nervous anticipation or not, she couldn\u2019t keep from stroking her gaze over his chest as she waited for the verdict. What would it feel like to touch him, to rub her\u2014</p><p>\u201cSocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to change my mind?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Getting rid of the socks, she dealt the next game since he appeared to be content with her playing dealer. Except it was impossible to concentrate with him lying on his back only two feet from her, one leg stretched out on the carpet, the other bent at the knee as he held his cards up above him. It was like being shown the most beautiful classic statue in the world and being told not to touch.</p><p>Her nails dug into her palms.</p><p>\u201cBaby?\u201d</p><p>Expecting more of the sensual teasing that had her melting from the inside out, she was surprised at the tenderness she caught in that wolf-pale gaze. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to be naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agreed to play the game.\u201d Sienna always kept her word. It was a choice she\u2019d made after leaving the Net, a stance that defined her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked.\u201d</p><p>She could\u2019ve lied to spare her pride, but that wasn\u2019t what she wanted between them. \u201cI\u2019m not as comfortable being naked as a changeling.\u201d She\u2019d never been nude in front of anyone after the age of five, except in a medical setting. Those weren\u2019t good memories.</p> <p>Hawke put down his cards. \u201cWant to touch?\u201d The sensual invitation sliced right through the cold echo of the humiliation that had been her yearly physical, when her entire body was inspected from head to toe to ascertain that she had no imperfections that might make her a less viable weapon.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said, her throat thick with raw want.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m all yours.\u201d</p><p>Pushing aside the cards, she crawled to kneel beside him. \u201cAnywhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you don\u2019t indulge your weird foot fetish.\u201d A lazy smile that invited her to play.</p><p>It was an irresistible temptation. Leaning down, she kissed that teasing mouth. His hand immediately fisted in her hair, holding her to him as he tasted her with breath-stealing thoroughness. \u201cWill you ever,\u201d she said, chest rising and falling as she attempted to take in air, \u201cgive me control in this kind of a situation? In a sexual context?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The wolf looking up at her. \u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d</p><p>She put her hand on his chest, the tensile warmth of him a sudden, acute addiction. \u201cI have to be in control of my power every minute of every day.\u201d It was impossible not to stroke him, not to sleek her hand over the light covering on his chest that was even softer than it looked. It made her wonder how it would feel against her nipples.</p><p>His hand tightened in her hair. \u201cWhat just went through your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigure it out,\u201d she murmured, because while she discovered she wasn\u2019t averse to handing him the reins in bed, she wasn\u2019t about to roll over either. \u201cI want to touch now.\u201d</p><p>His chest vibrated under her palm, and she realized he\u2019d growled. But the sound held no anger. It was more sensual, deeper . . . intimate. Thinking back to what she\u2019d been doing, she realized she\u2019d grazed one flat male nipple with her nail.</p><p>So she did it again.</p><p>Making that same rumbling sound, he tugged her down with the grip he had in her hair, and took her mouth again, his lips a possessive brand. She found herself on her back, with him heavy between her thighs a second later. When she pushed at his shoulders, he said, \u201cYou can still touch.\u201d A light kiss on the corner of her lips, his stubbled jaw scraping across achingly sensitive flesh.</p><p>\u201cNot if you keep doing that.\u201d It was beyond impossible to concentrate with him so big and warm and aroused above her. \u201cHawke.\u201d</p><p>Something in Sienna\u2019s voice made Hawke\u2019s wolf go motionless. Bracing himself with his forearms on either side of her head, he looked into eyes of inky black. \u201cYou need a break?\u201d He hadn\u2019t forgotten who and what she was, the demands her gift made on her.</p><p>Her hands smoothed down his chest.</p><p>It took teeth-gritting control not to order her to stroke those hands over the hard ridge of his cock. \u201cBaby, that\u2019s not going to make me behave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s my turn. I need to touch you.\u201d</p><p>A cool statement, but he heard the very real frustration behind it. As evidenced by the last time they\u2019d been together, frustration in bed could be fun\u2014but not the kind he heard in her voice. Need stripped bare, the same raw-touch hunger that had had him in its claws before he\u2019d allowed himself to indulge in her. She was right. It was her turn.</p><p>So he locked his muscles, dropped his head, hair falling around his face, and let her pet him. Remaining quiescent under her exploration was torture, hungry as he was to claim her. Yet the wolf grit its teeth along with the human, as if aware that this woman, while strong enough to survive a childhood that would\u2019ve broken most, was also deeply vulnerable in certain ways.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d A husky murmur that was a rough stroke across his taut flesh. \u201cYour chest hair, it\u2019s so smooth, so fine. Like the thinnest of pelts.\u201d</p><p>It was also highly sensitive. \u201cUse your mouth,\u201d he found himself demanding as the leash slipped.</p><p>But Sienna didn\u2019t shy. \u201cOh, yes. I want to do that.\u201d While he was still trying to quiet his primal response at the unhidden delight of her response, she wiggled down a fraction and placed a hot, uninhibited kiss right above his left nipple. He bit back a very blue word, a sheen of sweat coating his entire body. As he knew, Sienna learned fast. Her next kiss included the scrape of teeth.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s growl raised every hair on Sienna\u2019s body. Shivering, she licked at him, taking the salt and heat of him inside her. Part of her couldn\u2019t believe she had her hands on him at last, that she was free to stroke and taste as she wanted. The rest of her wanted to gorge, her legs clenching around the sensual intrusion of the big body between her thighs.</p><p>It would be easier to reach all of him if she pushed him to his back, but first, she wasn\u2019t entirely sure he\u2019d go, and second, being surrounded by him was . . . beyond pleasure. His thighs pushed against the insides of hers as the thick weight of his erection pressed through his jeans, just brushing against her. His arms were tense with muscle on either side of her, his chest above her, his hair falling sexily around his face as he watched her with a predator\u2019s focus. One who wanted to bite.</p><p>She tried to reach his lips, fell short. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>Leaning down without a word, he ran his lips across hers. It was a tease, made her attempt to rise toward him once more.</p><p>\u201cNu-huh.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cBe good.\u201d</p><p>Trembling, she lay back down.</p><p>Her reward was a suckling kiss, teeth closing over her lower lip, a languid release that made things low in her stretch tight. \u201cI hope you like teeth,\u201d he said in that rough, deep voice that made her want to do infinitely wicked things.</p><p>\u201cI like yours.\u201d</p><p>He settled himself more heavily on her. She felt at once caged and as if she would fly into a million pieces with the slightest touch. Panic fluttered in her throat, the shock of a woman who\u2019d grown up in a prison of discipline and darkness. \u201cHawke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Kisses on her cheekbone, his forearm bracketing her head as he used his free hand to play with strands of her hair. Another kiss, this one on her nose. \u201cWe\u2019ve got all night.\u201d A whisper of a kiss on the corner of her mouth. Another. \u201cNo need to rush.\u201d</p><p>Gentling her, she thought, he was gentling her.</p><p>The unexpected tenderness of him surprised her . . . undid her. Yet, even at this moment, there was no doubting the power of the wolf who prowled behind his eyes. \u201cDid you always know you\u2019d be alpha?\u201d she found herself whispering into the intimate hush.</p><p>His expression changed, became touched with darkness. \u201cI knew when I needed to know,\u201d he said at last, and though the words were unspoken, she understood he wanted her to drop the subject.</p><p>That was the one thing she couldn\u2019t do, though she knew her persistence might shatter the magic of this sensual moment. Touching him, being with him, it was only part of what she needed from his man. She couldn\u2019t have his soul, couldn\u2019t have the mating bond, but she\u2019d fight for the rest of him even if it left her bruised and bloody. \u201cWhat did the Psy do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey broke my father.\u201d Clipped-out words. \u201cIt took them a week.\u201d</p><p>Bile burned the back of her throat. It was near impossible to disrupt changeling shields without killing or injuring the target, but given a week with a wolf who, in all probability, had been dosed with drugs . . . \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing for you to be sorry about.\u201d His fingers tightened on her hip. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have anything to do with the experiment.\u201d</p><p>A chill over her skin, the first glimmer of horror. \u201cExperiment?\u201d She reached out to stroke his jaw, found it hard as stone.</p><p>\u201cEnough. There\u2019s nothing there except blood and death.\u201d He thrust his hand into her hair. \u201cWhat we are now, that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>How could he say that? The past had savaged him\u2014he carried the scars on his heart to this day. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t shut me out like that.\u201d Don\u2019t give me even less of you.</p><p>Shaking his head, he moved as if to kiss her, to end the conversation . . . froze. \u201cSienna, your eyes, they\u2019re burning.\u201d</p><p>Jerked back to the cold reality of her life, she dropped into her mind, saw the storm of flame. It shouldn\u2019t have built to critical again this fast, shouldn\u2019t have incinerated her shields and poured into her eyes, a violent voracious thing that would consume everything in its path and search for more. Fear squeezed her throat, but she had no time for the ice of it. \u201cI need to get out of the den. Now.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 34</p><p>THEY TOOK ONE of the all-wheel drives as deep into the isolated interior of den territory as possible before Sienna said, \u201cStop.\u201d Tumbling out of the vehicle the second Hawke braked, she ran toward a small clearing surrounded by the tall bulk of dark green firs, her feet cushioned by millions of pine needles. \u201cStep back,\u201d she ordered when Hawke caught up to her.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t scorch the earth when you release your power,\u201d he said, the planes of his face a study in pure, implacable will. \u201cYou didn\u2019t burn me when you lost control as you came.\u201d He locked his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cLet go!\u201d It terrified her that she\u2019d hurt him. \u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>His arms were immovable steel. \u201cI trust you. Trust yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHawke!\u201d Energy poured out of her in a screaming rush. Acting on primal instinct, she threw a shield of cold fire around every part of Hawke that touched her a split second before she punched a massive pulse of the same fire into the earth. It rippled in an eerie wave of crimson and gold on the surface before sinking below the forest floor. Beautiful.</p><p>Then there was no more thought. Only the brutal cold of an X.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long the fire burned through her, but she would\u2019ve crumpled to the ground afterward if Hawke hadn\u2019t been holding her up. Shuddering, she leaned against him only for the seconds it took her to get her legs working again. Then she shoved, surprising him into releasing her.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard! I could\u2019ve killed you!\u201d Shock continued to shudder in her blood, fighting with terror-fueled rage for dominance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re allowing fear to drive you,\u201d he responded, eyes grim with determination. \u201cMing\u2019s still in your head, keeping you in a cage. Break out and own your ability.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a load of bullshit!\u201d Never before had she screamed at anyone. Never before had she felt such bone-chilling fear. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about being an X! Have you forgotten I almost killed my own mother?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were a child.\u201d</p><p>Her laugh was flavored with bitterness. \u201cYou have no idea what I can do.\u201d All this time, she\u2019d been fooling herself that he wanted her despite knowing she was a monster. If he\u2019d understood in truth . . . \u201cYou felt the intensity of what I earthed. Yet I can do this.\u201d A single flick of her hand and X-fire encased a forest giant that had stood for centuries.</p><p>Ash, fine as dust, rose into the air between one blink and the next.</p><p>\u201cNow you know.\u201d</p><p>HAWKE gritted his jaw as Sienna swayed on her feet. \u201cThat was a singularly stupid thing to do.\u201d Grabbing her in a fireman\u2019s carry, he threw her over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cPut me down.\u201d A weak protest before her body went limp.</p><p>Worry tore through his veins, but he could feel her heartbeat, sense her breath. Focusing on that, he strapped her into the passenger seat before digging out his phone. \u201cSienna\u2019s unconscious,\u201d he said when Judd answered.</p><p>The other man took a second to reply. \u201cShe\u2019s fine. Her mind is intact.\u201d</p> <p>Relief was a punch to Hawke\u2019s gut. \u201cI\u2019m going to strip her hide when she wakes up.\u201d Shutting the passenger door, he jogged around to the driver\u2019s side and switched the phone to the hands-free comm mode before beginning the drive back.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds,\u201d Judd said when Hawke finished relaying what had led to Sienna\u2019s collapse, \u201clike she overloaded her psychic pathways.\u201d</p><p>Hawke frowned. \u201cSo she does have a safety switch.\u201d He\u2019d gotten the impression that conscious control was so necessary to Sienna because she had no built-in off switch.</p><p>Judd didn\u2019t reply long enough that Hawke\u2019s blood went cold. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we need to have this discussion after you return.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s patience was nonexistent when it came to Sienna\u2019s well-being, but he saw the lieutenant\u2019s point. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d</p><p>Judd met them at the infirmary, where Lara ran a high-tech medical scanner over Sienna and pronounced her in perfect health. Only then did Hawke nod at Judd to follow him out into the corridor. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s accelerating at an exponential rate,\u201d Judd said, pulling up a chart on the tiny datapad he carried in his pocket. \u201cAfter she confirmed she\u2019d been purging her power more often of late, I spoke to Walker to see if we could pinpoint any specific times or dates. It took me until just before the South American operation to realize it was Toby we needed to speak to\u2014she allows him closer than anyone else.\u201d</p><p>White lines bracketed the former Arrow\u2019s mouth. \u201cHe knew before all of us. He\u2019s been making a note in his diary each time he feels she\u2019s about to go critical. Since she hasn\u2019t had any incidents, the logical conclusion is that she instituted a purge in each case.\u201d Judd turned the datapad so Hawke could see the screen.</p><p>The pattern was impossible to miss. It had been almost a year between Sienna\u2019s arrival and the first time she earthed herself. The next came after eight months. Then six. The last few had been mere weeks apart. Hawke\u2019s wolf rose to the fore, helping the man think with clear-eyed purpose. \u201cCan it be stopped?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d An absolute statement. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes her an X.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence\u201d\u2014he forced himself to say that word, to consider that option\u2014\u201ckept her under some kind of containment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly to an extent. She\u2019s the sole cardinal X ever born, according to our records. Even Ming was playing a game of Russian roulette with her. No one had any idea what would happen as her power matured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she doesn\u2019t want to know.\u201d Black erased the gold-flecked brown of Judd\u2019s eyes, a rare indication of strong emotion. \u201cThe only way she can survive is to believe that she can change the inevitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we leave it at that.\u201d He could see Sienna growing deeper into her skin day by day. No way in hell was he going to cut her off at the knees. \u201cYou sound certain that it can\u2019t be stopped, but is there any way to slow the progression?\u201d</p><p>Judd shoved a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for the manuscript I mentioned to you once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dissertation on X-Psy?\u201d</p><p>The other man nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve found no evidence to confirm its existence, but I\u2019m waiting to hear back from one final contact.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf caught the minute change in Judd\u2019s expression. \u201cThe Ghost. You don\u2019t trust him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in this. She\u2019s a weapon of infinite potential.\u201d</p><p>And the Ghost, Hawke knew, had an agenda that had nothing to do with peace.</p><p>EIGHT hours later, with the mountains kissed white-gold by the morning sun, Hawke stood staring at the door that had just been slammed in his face. \u201cSienna,\u201d he growled.</p><p>Silence from the other side.</p><p>He slammed his hands palms down on the flat surface hard enough that she couldn\u2019t miss it. Waited. Still nothing. Part of him\u2014the part that made him alpha\u2014wanted to rip the door off its hinges, throw her onto the bed, and teach her what happened to a woman who dared defy him. He wouldn\u2019t hurt her. But he would bite her. Hard.</p><p>Strangling the primitive urge, he decided to walk it off but changed his mind midway and headed to the garage instead. The drive gave him enough time to settle so that he wasn\u2019t feeling completely feral when he arrived at his destination\u2014after having made a small detour to pick up something.</p><p>Sascha laughed when he handed her the stuffed toy wolf. \u201cHow did you talk your way past the sentinels?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNatural charm.\u201d He thought about kissing her on the cheek but decided to cut Lucas a break.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?\u201d the leopard demanded, his hands on Sascha\u2019s hips as they stood in the doorway of the cabin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come to meet my new girl,\u201d Hawke said, doing his best to look harmless. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>Lucas scowled, but moved out of the doorway when Sascha turned to press a kiss to his jaw. \u201cCome in,\u201d the empath said, heading deeper into the cabin.</p><p>Hawke hung back long enough to stick out his hand. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shook it. \u201cThanks.\u201d Jerking his head toward the bedroom, he said, \u201cSascha refuses to move the bassinet to the nursery yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Sascha?\u201d Hawke raised an eyebrow.</p><p>The snarl was quiet but no less powerful for it. \u201cDo you want to see her or not?\u201d</p><p>Hawke caught a delicate new scent hidden beneath the protective markers of a panther and an empath as soon as he crossed the threshold. Baby powder and smiles. The innocence of it made his wolf stop pacing, anger and irritation temporarily shelved.</p><p>Conscious of the instincts that had to be clawing at Lucas, he kept his hands behind his back as he peered down at the tiny creature in Sascha\u2019s arms, her curious eyes already as bright green as her father\u2019s. \u201cHello, sweet darling.\u201d It was impossible not to smile, not to fall in love a little.</p><p>Sascha nuzzled the baby with a gentle, maternal kiss before saying, \u201cWould you like to hold her?\u201d</p><p>Hawke glanced to Luc first. The leopard alpha nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll tear your throat out if you even breathe wrong.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d Taking the precious bundle from Sascha, he cuddled the baby close to the warmth of his body. When she scrunched up her face, he laughed. \u201cYes, I am a wolf, little cat.\u201d Touching a careful finger to her nose, he was startled to feel tiny hands grip at it. \u201cLook at that.\u201d</p><p>Fascinated, Sascha thought, looking from one man to the other. They were both fascinated. It hadn\u2019t astounded her in the least when Naya had wrapped Lucas around her finger, but somehow, she\u2019d expected Hawke to last longer. But really, was it any surprise? He was alpha, too, had those same strong protective urges running through his blood.</p><p>The baby made a fussy noise.</p> <p>Taking her from Hawke, Lucas held her against his chest, purring low and steady until their princess quieted in contentment. Sascha didn\u2019t know how she stood it, the love for her mate and child that filled her body. It was so visceral, so intertwined in every cell of her being. An impossible, huge thing that eclipsed all that had come before.</p><p>It threatened to blind her to everything else, but she was an E-Psy. And so, she caught the whisper of darkness in the man who was an alpha without a mate. Glancing at Lucas, she tilted her head. He scowled. She pursed her lips. Sighing, he said, \u201cI think baby girl here wants to go for a walk.\u201d</p><p>Hawke exited first, with Sascha following Lucas out. He walked across the clearing until he was out of hearing range\u2014if they kept their voices low. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about something,\u201d she said to Hawke, cutting to the heart of it.</p><p>Black thunder rolled across that harsh but beautiful face. \u201cStop doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it.\u201d She never intruded on people\u2019s emotions, but she could no more stop sensing them than Hawke could turn off his sense of smell.</p> <p>Folding his arms, he leaned against the cabin wall while she perched on the window ledge a foot away. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d She prodded, because you had to with men so used to keeping everything contained. \u201cDoes it have to do with Sienna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the only one who incites this reaction in you.\u201d</p><p>Hawke stared at where Lucas walked the baby. \u201cShe\u2019s refusing to talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat shocks you.\u201d No, Sascha thought, that wasn\u2019t quite it. \u201cIt stuns you that she\u2019s able to hold out against you.\u201d</p><p>Hawke scowled. \u201cYou make me sound like an ass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot an ass\u2014just a man who rarely has anyone stand up to him.\u201d She felt the baby\u2019s searching mind, sent reassurance as she did a thousand times a day. \u201cTell me why she\u2019s not talking to you.\u201d</p><p>After Hawke finished, she said, \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Pale eyes pinned her to the spot, his dominance a staggering wave. If she hadn\u2019t been used to living with Lucas, she might\u2019ve wilted. As it was, she touched her fingers to his jaw and pushed a fraction. \u201cStop that.\u201d</p><p>The wolf continued to prowl behind that icy gaze, but he glanced away.</p><p>\u201cLet me ask you one thing,\u201d she said, wondering if she\u2019d be able to get through to him, this man who, from what she knew, had become alpha at an even younger age than Lucas. \u201cIf Judd told you to keep your distance, would you?\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms, biceps pushing against the sleeves of his white T-shirt. \u201cThe two situations aren\u2019t the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a cardinal, Hawke.\u201d Gentle words, but Sascha was a cardinal, too, and the statement held a piercing power as it settled on Hawke\u2019s skin. \u201cIf you\u2019re to have any kind of a relationship with her, you must accept what she is\u2014ignoring her when she makes a decision about her own power is about as far as you can get from acceptance.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf paced inside his mind, wanting to tear at her words with its claws. \u201cI have to get back.\u201d There were a hundred things he had to handle today, but the most critical, he thought as he said good-bye to the leopard pair, would take some careful planning. There would be no more doors slammed in his face\u2014of that much, both man and wolf were certain.</p> <p>RESPONSE FROM ESTES PARK POLICE DEPARTMENT TO QUERY BY GEORGE KIM ON BEHALF OF PROFESSORS MAE AND ELLISON ELDRIDGE: JANUARY 8, 1975</p><p>We regret to inform you that Alice Eldridge appears to have suffered a fatal accident during her most recent climb. A search-and-rescue unit is attempting to recover the body, but it is lodged so deep inside a crevasse that it may not be safe to proceed. Telekinetic assistance has been denied.</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>ACCORDING TO A packmate, Lara had headed down to the waterfall, but Walker found no sign of her when he arrived. In the end, it was the crimson of her wool coat that gave her away\u2014she was sitting tucked into the trees, her face turned toward the wild fury of the water.</p><p>Knowing she\u2019d catch his scent, he walked to sit by her side, his shoulder touching hers. \u201cYou have shadows under your eyes.\u201d He wanted to reach across and wipe them away, even knowing that to be impossible. When she didn\u2019t reply, he said, \u201cTalk to me, Lara.\u201d He wasn\u2019t used to silence from the woman who had become his closest friend.</p><p>\u201cI had an emergency call from one of the women this morning. She was three months pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Everything in Walker went quiet. \u201cSomething was wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a miscarriage.\u201d She took a ragged breath. \u201cThere was no warning, nothing to indicate a problem. I keep a careful eye on the pregnant women, but I didn\u2019t catch this\u2014\u201d Wet in her voice. \u201cI couldn\u2019t fix it.\u201d</p><p>He touched his hand to the wild energy of her curls. \u201cSome pregnancies terminate without any apparent reason, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntellectually, yes. But . . . She\u2019s in so much emotional pain right now.\u201d</p><p>Stroking his hand down the stiff line of her spine, he rested it on her hip. \u201cI saw Hawke in the infirmary with a young couple when I went to find you.\u201d</p><p>Lara nodded. \u201cI called him in. He\u2019ll be able to help her wolf to an extent, help her mate, too.\u201d She wrapped her arms around raised knees. \u201cShe\u2019s strong, healthy, will heal. I just hate that she\u2019s having to go through this hurt. I hate it.\u201d</p><p>Walker wasn\u2019t female, would never carry a child, but he was a father. \u201cYelene,\u201d he found himself saying, speaking a secret he\u2019d never shared, \u201cwas pregnant with our second child when we got the rehabilitation order.\u201d</p><p>Lara sucked in a breath. \u201cShe lost the baby.\u201d</p><p>Of course she\u2019d think that, this healer who worried so much about her pack. \u201cThe order was for everyone who bore Lauren blood. She\u2019d already aborted the child by the time I came home.\u201d Everything else, he would have accepted, would have survived, but that act, it broke something inside him. Because even in the PsyNet, he\u2019d worked with children. Dangerous, gifted children, but children nonetheless, and he\u2019d done everything in his power to protect them. Yet\u2014\u201cI couldn\u2019t protect my child.\u201d</p><p>Hearing Lara\u2019s quiet sobs, he turned and took her into his arms, weaving his fingers into her hair. She buried her face against his chest and cried as if her heart was splintering. She understood, he thought, knew that it wasn\u2019t only his unborn child that had died that day. But . . . as Lara cried for the child he\u2019d lost, as she gave voice to the grief he couldn\u2019t express, the tight knot of sorrow inside him began to unravel fragment by jagged fragment.</p><p>\u201cI sometimes wonder,\u201d he whispered, the soft skin of her nape delicate under his palm, \u201cwhat my son would\u2019ve been like.\u201d</p><p>Lara\u2019s hand spread on the fabric of his shirt. \u201cTell me what you imagined.\u201d Her voice was raw with weeping, but her strength, it was an enduring flame.</p><p>It took him a long time, but as the water continued to thunder into the pool below, Walker held the warmth of her close and spoke of the son who lived deep within his heart and always would.</p><p>HAWKE nodded at Lake as he jogged down to the perimeter in the quiet of the hour before midnight. \u201cAny problems?\u201d</p><p>The soldier shook his head. \u201cSpotted a couple of falcons in the distance when it was light, but they stayed clear of den territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Hawke spent several more minutes talking to Lake, having had a heads-up from Riley about him. Intelligent, Hawke thought, and not only that, but he had the capacity to think outside the box. \u201cAre you happy with your current duties?\u201d</p><p>Lake took a deep breath. \u201cIf I had the choice, I\u2019d prefer more complex tasks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to Riley tomorrow,\u201d Hawke said, because he didn\u2019t want the talented young male getting bored. \u201cHe\u2019ll shift your duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand we\u2019re at high alert after the recent events.\u201d An intent look. \u201cI can wait until we\u2019re better situated to move things around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re not going to allow anyone to stifle the growth of our pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Lake glanced down, back up. \u201cI wanted to say something\u2014about Maria.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still pretty cut up about stepping off watch that time. If you could . . .\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf liked the boy better for his request. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d A faint smile. \u201cSienna should be about five hundred meters to the north.\u201d</p><p>Hawke pointed south. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>Lake left with a salute\u2014and a grin.</p><p>Jogging along the perimeter until he caught the rich, vibrant scent of a woman who was well and truly under his skin, he drew in a deep breath of the cool mountain air and leashed his wolf. Demands would get neither man nor wolf anything when it came to Sienna. Neither would orders. This was about male and female. Hawke and Sienna.</p><p>He found her standing watch on a cliff\u2019s edge, keeping an acute eye on everything that passed. Quiet as it was, it took her the barest instant to detect him. \u201cWould you like a report, sir?\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes at her tone, but where the alpha in him would\u2019ve delivered a quick and lethal verbal response to anyone else, that wasn\u2019t the relationship he wanted with Sienna. \u201cNo, I\u2019d prefer a kiss.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Back as stiff as steel, she said, \u201cI\u2019m working,\u201d but then, to his surprise, glanced back. \u201cI heard about Ameline\u2019s miscarriage.\u201d Her expression was solemn.</p><p>The memory of his packmate\u2019s silent cries had his wolf wanting to lift its muzzle in a mournful howl. \u201cShe\u2019s hurting bad, but she\u2019s strong. So is her mate. They\u2019ll survive this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sat with her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Controlling the impulse to fist his hand in her hair, tug her close until he could breathe in the warm spice of her skin . . . until he could unwind on the deepest level, he focused on the land that was his home. The night was stunning, the velvet sky dotted with diamonds. \u201cDo you wonder if the Council understands why we\u2019d fight to the last breath to hold this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her own face lifted to the sky. \u201cThe psychologists will have done a full workup. But they won\u2019t believe you\u2019d refuse to surrender even at the threat of massive casualties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome things are beyond logic.\u201d Losing their home would rip the heart out of the pack\u2014it wouldn\u2019t matter if they survived. \u201cWe both know that.\u201d He stroked his hand down the thick rope of her braid.</p><p>She jerked away, the truce over. \u201cYou ignored me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did. And I\u2019m not sorry I did it.\u201d Maybe he\u2019d been an ass, but he\u2019d also been right\u2014she had been short-changing herself, had now learned that she could wield and direct the cold fire, choose her targets even at that level of pressure.</p> <p>\u201cSurprising.\u201d Sarcasm dripped off the single word.</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d he added with a growl, \u201cI won\u2019t disregard your views about your own abilities next time.\u201d</p><p>Sienna froze at the unexpected statement. \u201cNot much of an apology,\u201d she said, scrambling to reorder her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I wasn\u2019t apologizing.\u201d</p><p>Of course not. \u201cGo away.\u201d</p><p>He tugged at her neat braid instead, unraveling it before she realized what he was doing. Gritting her teeth to stop from reacting, she stared out at the hush of the forest as he smoothed out the strands. \u201cYou have curls in here,\u201d he murmured from behind her. \u201cDid you braid it while it was damp?\u201d</p> <p>That sneaky wolf charm was not going to weaken her defenses this time. \u201cI\u2019m working, in case you didn\u2019t hear me the first time.\u201d</p><p>Arms sliding around her waist, tugging her back against a warm male chest. \u201cI\u2019ve come to keep you company.\u201d</p><p>Reaching back, she pulled her hair out from between them. \u201cI like being alone.\u201d</p><p>A quick nip of her ear. \u201cSuch a liar.\u201d</p><p>Folding her arms, she resisted the urge to kick back at him with a booted foot. \u201cThis patch is quiet,\u201d she said. \u201cLake wanted to run tonight, so I\u2019m standing as sentry.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s arms came up to cross over her chest as he held her impossibly closer, his thighs on either side of hers. \u201cThat was one of my first tasks\u2014sentry.\u201d His voice was quiet, full of memory. \u201cThe alpha started putting me on watch when I was nine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNine?\u201d Far too young, according to SnowDancer\u2019s own rules.</p><p>Hawke chuckled. \u201cI was making trouble\u2014had too much energy and nowhere for it to go. They tried running me to exhaustion, but I outlasted everyone except Garrick, and the alpha couldn\u2019t spend every day with me.\u201d</p> <p>Sienna realized she\u2019d relaxed against him, but she was too fascinated by this tiny glimpse into his past to worry. \u201cWere you a good sentry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said to her surprise. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stop moving long enough to keep watch.\u201d Another laugh. \u201cSo Garrick made me a messenger. I ran constantly along the perimeter, taking messages from one sentry to another, spending time with the soldiers, learning from them.\u201d Looking back, he knew half the messages had been created to give him something to do.</p><p>\u201cIt was the best thing Garrick could have done.\u201d The work had not only provided an outlet for his energy, it had begun to teach him the skills he would need in the future\u2014as well as connecting him to the men and women he would one day be called upon to lead.</p><p>\u201cThis Garrick was a good alpha?\u201d</p><p>Hawke thought of the slender black man who\u2019d appeared about as strong as a willow branch\u2014and who had fought like a gladiator for his pack. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Sienna paused. \u201cI guess . . . no one ever mentions him, so I thought maybe he was a bad person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Hawke forced himself to speak. \u201cThey don\u2019t say anything because they don\u2019t want to hurt me.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t fair to the man, the alpha Garrick had been. \u201cGarrick died fighting one of his lieutenants.\u201d The next words were stone fists in his chest. \u201cMy father.\u201d</p><p>Sienna\u2019s hands came up to close over his. \u201cYou said he was abducted, hurt. He was no longer the man you knew.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s mind filled with the memory of the agony on his father\u2019s face as blood poured out of his chest. He\u2019d taken his last breath in his mate\u2019s arms, his hand held by his mortally wounded alpha as their already weak healer tried to save them both.</p><p>\u201cWas your father the only one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mother . . . she lost her mate.\u201d</p><p>He never spoke of his laughing, gifted mother and what it had done to her to lose her mate, not to anyone. \u201cThere\u2019s Lake, coming up now,\u201d he said instead of answering her question. \u201cI think we should go for a run.\u201d A high pitched whistle and Lake raised his hand to signal he understood.</p><p>When Hawke shifted to face Sienna, he saw her eyes had turned to midnight. \u201cYou\u2019re good at keeping a distance between you and a lover, aren\u2019t you, Hawke?\u201d</p><p>He curved a hand over the column of her throat, stroked. \u201cI haven\u2019t exactly been keeping my distance from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more than one kind of distance.\u201d Not saying anything further, she took a black hair tie out of her pocket and pulled her hair into a sleek ponytail.</p><p>Her words disturbed both man and wolf, but his past wasn\u2019t why he\u2019d tracked her down. \u201cCome on, Lake\u2019s almost to us.\u201d Loping down the slope, he waited for her to catch up. They ran the watch at a moderate speed, which allowed them to take in their surroundings, confirm everything was as it should be. \u201cYour need to purge the cold fire,\u201d he said, wanting to get that out of the way, \u201cwas that because of my touch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said at once. \u201cI was aware it was building\u2014just made a miscalculation as to how close I was to critical.\u201d</p><p>Hawke thought of Judd\u2019s revelation, placed it against Sienna\u2019s will. He knew where he was putting his money. \u201cYou fully recovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Deciding to set the issue aside for tonight, he asked, \u201cWho\u2019s your preferred partner on watch?\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question from alpha to soldier, but man to woman. He wanted to simply be with her on this beautiful night, her voice brushing against his skin as they passed under the moon shadow of forest giants.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t believe me, but Maria.\u201d Sienna ducked under a branch, leaving a strand of ruby red behind.</p><p>He liked that she\u2019d inadvertently marked their territory. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>She wrinkled her nose at him. \u201cUntil the fight, we worked well together. We\u2019ve actually kind of become friends since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I remember your buddies from Wild.\u201d</p><p>Ignoring his snarl, she pointed out a fleeing rabbit. \u201cLake is very serious\u2014too much like me. I think we become too quiet together.\u201d</p><p>Hawke could see how that could happen. Sienna needed a wolf who was willing to play. Though of course, wolves weren\u2019t the only predators in this region. \u201cSeen that leopard cub lately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about Kit, yes. I had lunch with him today.\u201d</p><p>He felt claws pricking at the insides of his skin as they came to a halt on top of another rise that allowed them to look out over the territory. \u201cLunch.\u201d</p><p>Most women would\u2019ve either bristled or frozen at his not-so-subtle attempt at intimidation. Sienna showed how shockingly well she knew him by ambushing him with an unexpected bite on his lower lip as he bent to demand more information. She was gone before he could retaliate.</p><p>His wolf bowed its back in pleasure, happy to play with her at any time and delighted she\u2019d initiated this game. Catching up to her, he shot her a look that promised revenge. Her response was pure cool-eyed Psy . . . except for the laughter hidden in that cardinal gaze. He was about to tug her to him, taste the laughter, when he heard something that had his wolf coming to a dead stop.</p><p>STOPPING at once when Hawke went motionless, Sienna shoved her amusement to the back of her consciousness. \u201cWhat do you sense?\u201d She kept her voice subvocal, in a range she could only just hear herself.</p><p>Not answering, Hawke angled his head to the left, narrowed his eyes, then arched his neck.</p><p>The eerie beauty of the howl electrified every tiny hair on her body. It seemed impossible that it was coming from a human throat, and yet she could see the reality of it in the corded strength of his neck. Responding howls came back to them over the air currents as the last echoes of Hawke\u2019s warning\u2014and she\u2019d learned enough about wolf harmonics to have figured out that that\u2019s exactly what it had been\u2014died out.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Hawke set what was a brutal pace for her, leading them away from the perimeter.</p><p>He sent up another howl maybe thirty seconds into the run, waited only long enough to get a response from each of the sentries. But a bare minute after they\u2019d begun to run again, he slammed her body to the ground, in the hollow created by the roots of a centuries-old tree, covered it with his own, and said, \u201cHands over your ears.\u201d</p><p>Stuttering blasts of noise sounded an instant later. She tried to turn, see where the bullets were hitting, but Hawke\u2019s body was too heavy, keeping her pinned. Hands over her ears as he\u2019d ordered, she stayed in position and hoped with everything in her that Lake and the others in the strike zone had gotten under cover before the attack. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It seemed to go on forever, an endless hail of violence. The increasing level of noise indicated the offensive craft was getting closer\u2014she was about to try to talk to Hawke, tell him they needed to move when the sonic boom of a massive explosion set her ears to ringing.</p><p>Chapter 36</p><p>A SECOND EXPLOSION followed on the heels of the first.</p> <p>Hawke rolled off her an instant later. \u201cBaby, you okay?\u201d</p><p>She said, \u201cYes,\u201d through the buzzing in her ears, aware he had to be in acute pain, given the sensitivity of changeling hearing. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurts like a bitch, but eardrums didn\u2019t blow.\u201d Getting to his feet, he hauled her up.</p><p>\u201cW\u2014\u201d Her dazed brain rallied to make sense of the debris raining down from the sky only meters away. \u201cWe need to check the wreckage as soon as possible, in case they have a Tk clean-up squad ready to mobilize.\u201d The destroyed craft might yield information the pack could use to its advantage in the growing hostilities.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Hawke said to her surprise. \u201cDo what you need to if Tks \u2019port in. I have to check on the others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><p>Getting his nod, she took off. The debris was lumps of blackened and twisted metal at first glance, nothing of any use. Keeping her senses\u2014physical and psychic\u2014on wide alert, she did a crisscrossing grid search at high speed, hoping like hell the pack\u2019s air-defense systems had left her something to find.</p><p>As it was, she almost missed it.</p><p>It had to have been part of the hull, a tiny warped square that she glimpsed with the corner of her eye. Running back to it, she gloved her hand in a layer of cold fire before picking it up. Her ability protected her from the blazing heat coming off the debris, but it did nothing to affect her vision.</p><p>The single silver star on the metal fragment was as bright as platinum.</p><p>HAWKE made contact with Brenna as he ran, the sat phone\u2019s reception crystal clear. \u201cAre the skies clean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes\u2014and the aerial defense systems are rearmed and ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Lara been notified?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s on her way. Riley\u2019s coordinating everything. I\u2019ll patch you through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasualties?\u201d he asked as soon as Riley came on the line.</p><p>\u201cNo reports so far.\u201d Crisp, collected words. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got some severe injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did it take so long to blow those bloody things out of the sky?\u201d SnowDancer knew its weaknesses, had prepared defenses. \u201cThey should\u2019ve been picked up before they ever got close enough to hit anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame stealth technology they used last time,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI\u2019ve asked the cats to send in teams to secure the wreckage until we can spare the people\u2014what we find could prove critical in modifying our detection systems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere they hit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. The attack was focused on SnowDancer.\u201d</p><p>Seeing Lake\u2019s fallen body, Hawke said, \u201cI\u2019ll call you back,\u201d and hung up.</p><p>The young soldier had taken a shot through his back, but he was breathing. \u201cGo,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m not going to fucking die and give them the satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>Good man. \u201cLara\u2019s on her way,\u201d he said, making the tough decision to take Lake at his word, check on the others.</p><p>It was a long night.</p><p>Lake had lost a lot of blood, but the bullet hadn\u2019t nicked anything major. Sam had been hit once, the bullet digging a channel across the side of his skull and knocking him out, but Lara assured Hawke the damage looked worse than it was. In\u00e9s had taken a bullet in the leg, Riaz had been hit in the shoulder and a newly promoted Tai had fractured his left arm as he dived to avoid the bullets, while Sing-Liu had been hit twice, both bullets entering through her back to crush a path through her internal organs.</p><p>The small human woman was the most badly injured, alive only because her mate, D\u2019Arn, had shoved his energy into her in an effort to keep her alive after he felt her pain through their bond. He\u2019d collapsed where he stood in the den, but he\u2019d kept her alive. It was now up to Lara and her team.</p><p>The DarkRiver healer, Tamsyn, worked beside Lara. She couldn\u2019t heal wolves, but as a qualified physician, she could take some of the burden by dealing with the less severe injuries. Riley and Indigo had the security situation under control, had made sure the attack left no gaps in their defensive perimeter, while the techs were combing through the wreckage. That left Hawke free to remain in the infirmary.</p><p>It was near dawn that he put his hands on Lara\u2019s shoulders and said, \u201cGo to bed.\u201d All the injured had been treated and were now resting.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she mumbled, cheek against his chest, \u201cone more espresso and I\u2019ll be set. Where\u2019s Tammy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer mate carried her off an hour ago.\u201d Literally. \u201cNow go to bed or I\u2019ll handcuff you to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinky.\u201d But she didn\u2019t resist when he walked her to her room and pushed her in the direction of the bed.</p><p>Turning around when he was certain she didn\u2019t plan to sneak back out, he made his way to his own quarters and stepped into the shower. Dressed in sweats and a clean T-shirt afterward, he didn\u2019t crash, but headed to Sienna\u2019s, knowing she\u2019d only returned to the den thirty minutes ago\u2014she\u2019d been on protection detail over the techs since the attack. Her strength made his wolf raise its head in pride.</p><p>She opened the door at his first knock and said nothing as he pulled off his T-shirt. When he nudged her into her bed, she went without argument. He curled himself behind her, nuzzled his face into the curve of her neck, and fell headlong into sleep.</p><p>LARA had fallen asleep the instant she stumbled facedown into bed, not bothering to strip, but her wolf nudged her awake what felt like moments later. \u201cWhat?\u201d she mumbled, feeling someone tugging at her shoes. \u201cOne sec\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d A strong, warm hand on her hair. \u201cJust getting these off.\u201d Another tug and her medical coat was gone, too.</p><p>\u201cKids,\u201d she mumbled, not able to find the will to move.</p><p>That big, callused hand stilled on her body. \u201cThey\u2019re with Drew and Indigo.\u201d</p><p>She tried to say that that was good, but exhaustion kicked her hard. Right before everything went dark, she felt Walker\u2019s lips on her temple, warm and firm. Wishful thinking. But it was a nice way to go into sleep.</p><p>NO, no, no, no, no, no, no, no . . .</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d Ming walked into the room to examine the pile of fine ash where there had once been a screaming person. \u201cWhile your lack of control is problematic, I can\u2019t be less than pleased with the strength of your ability.\u201d</p><p>She was a monster trapped in a room with another. Maybe she should just burn them both up, end it all.</p><p>A vice around her mind, black and vicious, a reminder that her thoughts weren\u2019t her own. \u201cStop, \u201d she said, blood trickling out of her nose.</p><p>\u201cRemember, Sienna,\u201d he said, the birthmark on the right side of his face the same color as her blood. \u201cI own you. You are my creature.\u201d</p><p>A growl in the evil silence of that room, shaking the very walls.</p><p>As she watched, Ming began to disintegrate until he was nothing, less than nothing. The sight of it caused her such violent pleasure that when the growl turned into a voice and ordered, \u201cRest. I \u2019ve got you,\u201d she snuggled back into a big, muscled body and surrendered to the wings of sleep once more.</p><p>SIENNA woke perhaps three hours after Hawke had come into her room. At the time, there\u2019d been no need or time for words\u2014though she had a vague memory of hearing his voice sometime in between. Frowning, she thought back, caught fragments of what might\u2019ve been a nightmare, but there were no lingering remnants of terror.</p><p>Hardly surprising given the protective heat of the man who slept curved around her. Hawke\u2019s thigh was pressed demandingly against the softest part of her, his hand flat on her abdomen beneath her favorite old tank, his arm under her head, his face nuzzled into the curve of her neck\u2014the reality of him was a sensual pulse under her skin.</p><p>Part of her wanted to turn around, to rub her face against the fine, silky hairs on his chest, but a bigger part was scared to shatter the moment, to have him wake and leave. She knew he\u2019d have to go. He was alpha, and last night, the pack had been attacked. He\u2019d given himself and his people a little time to rest and regroup, but morning had broken\u2014everything would kick into high gear as soon as he rose.</p><p>A rumble against her back, his hand moving in lazy circles on her abdomen as he wedged his thigh more firmly against her. \u201cMorning.\u201d That rough, male voice made her skin go taut, her face flush with heat that had nothing to do with embarrassment and everything to do with throat-clenching desire. She\u2019d never woken up with a man tangled around her, never thought that when it happened, it would be him.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d she managed to say, readying herself for the loss of his presence. \u201cI can make you coffee before you go.\u201d Yes, she wanted him to stay, but he was the heart of SnowDancer, being alpha as much a part of him as her abilities were of her. She\u2019d never consider getting in the way of his loyalty to the pack, had understood even as a girl barely out of the Net that he was loved by many, needed by many. \u201cI only have instant, but it\u2019s not bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot coffee,\u201d he said, kissing the curve of her neck. \u201cGive me something sweet to take into the day.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed down on that slowly rubbing thigh, her body tight, hot. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>His hand moved, his fingers trailing along the top of her waistband. \u201cTo pleasure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d She\u2019d never stuttered in her life, but it looked like that was about to happen. Swallowing, she attempted to rearrange her scattered thoughts. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve played before.\u201d Another kiss. \u201cYou said that wasn\u2019t what made the cold fire spill over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure my control is good enough,\u201d she admitted, because while emotion didn\u2019t drive the X-fire, it did have an impact on her capacity to cage it. That was what Silence had given those of her designation\u2014a cold, calm place in which to stand. \u201cAfter last night I feel as if my emotions are on a hair trigger. I might lose my grip on my abilities if I . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>Teeth nibbling at her shoulder, a wolfish tease. \u201cOrgasm. I think that\u2019s the word you\u2019re looking for.\u201d His fingers dipped just below the waistband of her pajama bottoms, making her pulse jump. He licked over the spot on her neck.</p> <p>She clenched around his thigh. \u201cHawke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay stop and we\u2019ll stop.\u201d Words spoken against the flush of her skin, but they held a serious undertone.</p><p>It turned a key inside of her to realize he was doing exactly as he\u2019d said he\u2019d do\u2014respecting her decision when it came to her abilities. \u201cNot yet,\u201d she whispered, keeping a rigid psychic grip on the reins of the cold fire.</p><p>Murmuring in approval, he withdrew his fingers, shifting their positions until he was braced on his side beside her as she lay on her back. Throwing a leg over her own, he said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t want you to escape,\u201d as he bent to kiss her.</p><p>It was slow, lazy, as if he had nowhere to be, though she knew he had a thousand calls on his time. Curling her arms around his neck, she drank in the warm masculinity of him as he continued to play his fingers over her skin. \u201cYes?\u201d he asked into her mouth when she broke off to catch her breath.</p> <p>Her stomach held a thousand frantic, trapped butterflies. It scared her how much he made her feel\u2014and that angered her. Sienna Lauren, Cardinal X, was never scared. It wasn\u2019t who she was. \u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p><p>He chuckled, pressing affectionate little kisses on the corners of her mouth. \u201cSo stubborn.\u201d Another kiss, a little bite of her lower lip as he slid his hand a fraction lower. \u201cExactly like I like you.\u201d</p><p>She felt her abdomen quiver, was powerless to stop it. Gripping his arm with one hand, the other on his shoulder, she luxuriated in the sensation of the muscle and tendon of him moving under her touch as he drew more of those languid circles low on her navel.</p><p>Lower.</p><p>A gasp escaped her, smothered against the skin of his neck. He smelled of warmth and man and Hawke. Just Hawke. Always Hawke. So when he slipped his hand under the waistband of her panties to run his finger down the center of her, she arched her body toward him in instinctive response.</p><p>He liked that. She knew because he kissed her jaw, murmured, \u201cYou\u2019re damp. I can smell you, all luscious and ready. Makes my mouth water.\u201d His finger stroked back up, and then he used two to spear through her, trapping her clitoris in between.</p> <p>SO responsive, Hawke thought as her body arched again, so sweetly responsive. It was all he could do not to pull down the pajama bottoms and panties she\u2019d worn to bed with a faded red tank and lick her up like his own personal dessert banquet. The sole thing stopping him was the fact that he knew he\u2019d have to rush it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he murmured against those lush lips he loved to kiss, to bite, to suck, \u201clet me pet you. Let me please you.\u201d Circling one finger at the slick entrance of her body, he pushed in gentle demand.</p><p>Her hands clenched on him again, but he tasted no fear in her scent\u2014only the earthy, intoxicating musk of feminine arousal. Still, he kissed and stroked and nuzzled until she relaxed, until she let him in. God, she was tight. Her cry was a breathy sound against his senses, her hips motionless for two long seconds before she began to shift them in experimental little moves on the intrusion of his finger.</p><p>He shuddered, kissed his way back up her throat to capture her mouth. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he said when she gasped for breath.</p><p>Using his thumb to rub at the tight bundle of nerves at the apex of her thighs even as he continued to thrust in and out of her with his finger, he bent his head and very carefully bit her nipple through the soft fabric of her tank.</p><p>\u201cHawke!\u201d Her body fractured around his hand, the slick heat of her such wicked temptation that he continued to stroke inside her as she trembled down from the orgasm, inciting tiny aftershocks of pleasure and indulging himself in the silken tightness of her at the same time.</p><p>Withdrawing his finger only when she moaned, her body limp, he cupped her with possessive intimacy and took her mouth again, nipping and licking and tasting. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>That cardinal gaze was a soft, hazy black when her lashes lifted. \u201cGood morning.\u201d Kiss-swollen lips shaping the words, the skin of her face marked red from the roughness of his stubble.</p> <p>He should\u2019ve been sorry he supposed, but he wasn\u2019t. He liked seeing his marks on her. Playing with the damp curls between her legs, careful not to touch her oversensitized clit, he simply watched her for long moments. His cock was a hard ridge in his sweats, his need painful, but no way in hell was he going to settle for a quickie their first time together.</p><p>Then she reached down to close her fingers over him.</p><p>Chapter 37</p><p>CHRIST. SLIDING HIS hand out from between her legs to press against the bed, he allowed himself to push into her touch. Once. Twice. \u201cEnough.\u201d Grabbing her wrist, he pinned it by her head.</p><p>Lazy, sated eyes smiled at him. \u201cYou felt so hard and hot and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou put your hand on me again,\u201d he warned, \u201cI won\u2019t be satisfied with a few strokes.\u201d No, it would just take the edge off . . . and unleash the wolf.</p><p>Curving her leg over his hip, Sienna leaned up to kiss his throat. \u201cThank you for my orgasm.\u201d</p><p>His cheeks creased. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>Another kiss before she lay back on the bed, looking up at him in a way that said she\u2019d glimpsed the harsh reality that had begun to force its way back into his mind.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going into war,\u201d he said, releasing his grip on her wrist. \u201cThere\u2019s no longer any doubt about it.\u201d</p><p>An intent gaze, fingers stroking his nape in tender affection. \u201cI think conflict has been inevitable since the instant the packs decided to stand against the Council on any level.\u201d</p><p>He took another kiss before changing their positions so that she lay on top of him, his hand on her lower back. Skin, his wolf insisted, skin. So he pushed his hand under the waistband of her pajama pants and panties to lie over the sweet curve of her butt. She jerked but relaxed almost at once. Good. He wanted her to get used to him, to his touch, to his body, since he planned to be indulging her, and indulging in her, on a regular basis.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t go looking for war,\u201d he said, caressing her with small, slow movements as he allowed himself a few more minutes of rest. \u201cIf the Council had left us alone, we\u2019d have left them alone.\u201d Discussing such a critical issue with Sienna was not something he\u2019d have considered even a few months ago, yet it now felt natural.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t accept,\u201d she said, playing her fingers over his collarbone, \u201cthat you\u2019re a power in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s always been the problem, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d He placed his free arm under his head.</p><p>\u201cSilence takes away everything else,\u201d she mused, \u201cbut power\u2014there is nothing in the Protocol that prevents a hunt for more. In truth, Silence rewards those who are cold-blooded enough to go after it with single-minded focus.\u201d</p><p>Hawke tried to think of what it must be like to live in the PsyNet, couldn\u2019t imagine it. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people say the Net is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes\u2014in the same way as a perfectly cut gemstone. Pristine and cold.\u201d Her hand stilled on his skin. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand that while I was in there, but even then, I knew it was wrong for a mother to be parted from her child.\u201d</p><p>He heard the pain in her, slid up his hand to press against her lower back. \u201cYou loved her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tried to save me, but she was a cardinal telepath with a secondary telekinetic ability\u201d\u2014a hitch\u2014\u201cand in the end, she couldn\u2019t save herself.\u201d</p><p>Hawke knew her mother had jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge, could guess at the scars the tragedy had left behind. \u201cDid her shields shatter?\u201d</p><p>A shake of her head, her cheek pressed to his shoulder. \u201cShe went mad. It happens with some strong telepaths, even under Silence. It\u2019s as if no shield is enough to protect them, as if other people\u2019s thoughts sneak in under cover of night and take up residence.\u201d A touch of wet on his chest, the taste of salt in the air. \u201cFree,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what my mother shouted as she jumped\u2014that she was free. Everyone believes she spoke of Silence, but I know my mother would\u2019ve done anything for silence. She wanted only to be free of the voices.\u201d</p><p>Such a pragmatic tone hiding so much pain. Such a slender body hiding so much power. Everything about Sienna was a contradiction. But on one thing, he wanted no doubt. \u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he said. \u201cUnderstand that.\u201d He\u2019d meant to reassure her that she need never fear he\u2019d abandon her, but her body was suddenly all tense muscle and bone against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never be yours until you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>He fisted his hand in her hair, tried to make his response gentle. \u201cI can\u2019t give you the mating bond, Sienna.\u201d He\u2019d been honest with her from the start, had hoped she wouldn\u2019t make him hurt her this way.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>A taut silence . . . because what else was there to say?</p><p>But Sienna spoke again. \u201cI don\u2019t think the attack means the Scotts intend a rapid escalation.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t try to force the conversation back to the original topic, though the possessive heart of him didn\u2019t like the answer she\u2019d given, no matter how unfair it was of him to demand more from her than he could offer. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the scattergun approach we talked about earlier.\u201d Self-possessed words, no hint of the tears drying on his chest. \u201cThe Councilors are well aware by now of how a changeling pack functions. They\u2019ll expect the attack to motivate you to evacuate your young, your vulnerable\u2014and so they\u2019ll be ready with an ambush.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s heart went cold at the idea of the pups being hurt.</p><p>\u201cThe targeted strikes, the ships designed to evade your defenses\u2014everything indicates that whoever is behind this has done their research,\u201d Sienna continued. \u201cIn my opinion, they\u2019ve figured out that the best way to demoralize the pack to the point of no return would be to wipe out the young.\u201d Her words were cool, crisp, but he didn\u2019t make the mistake of thinking she didn\u2019t care. He knew how many hours she volunteered in the White Zone, how many of the pups called her \u201cSinna\u201d and raised their arms for a cuddle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But the fact that she\u2019d seen that stomach-turning prospect, had the background to even consider it, was stark evidence of the darkness in which she\u2019d grown up. She\u2019d spent her childhood with a monster. And still she\u2019d managed to retain her personality, retain her soul. He was so fucking proud of her.</p><p>Right at that instant, her phone beeped. Though she made no move to answer it, there was no ignoring the fact that their time together had run out. \u201cI better go,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d She scrambled up to sit on the bed beside him when he rose.</p> <p>\u201cIn one hour,\u201d he said, getting to his feet and glancing at the oldfashioned wall clock she had to have found in a secondhand shop, \u201cI have a lieutenant meeting. I want you there.\u201d</p><p>A startled pause, followed by a quick nod. \u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Reaching over, he gripped her nape, kissing her deep and wet and again. \u201cNext time,\u201d he promised, \u201cI won\u2019t stop with just petting your sweet body.\u201d</p><p>Spice in the air, the taste of Sienna. \u201cThat assumes there\u2019ll be a next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should know better than to dare a wolf, baby.\u201d Nipping at that full lower lip he loved, he pointed a finger at her. \u201cOne hour.\u201d</p> <p>NINE a.m. and decisions were being made. Judd, Riley, Indigo, and a bandaged-up Riaz, along with Andrew, Sienna, and Hawke, were physically present in the conference room that had been designed to connect the lieutenants to Hawke no matter their location. It took a couple of minutes to patch everyone else in. Tom\u00e1s was the first to spot Sienna sitting unobtrusively to the side.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Sienna Lauren, as I live and breathe.\u201d A smile that held more than an edge of flirtation. \u201cAren\u2019t you looking pretty these days?\u201d</p><p>Sienna, to her credit, retained her cool. \u201cI saw you doing the chicken dance once, Tom\u00e1s. It wasn\u2019t sexy.\u201d</p><p>That made Kenji hoot with laughter, Alexei flash a megawatt grin. Hawke\u2019s wolf was pleased to see that Sienna\u2019s face didn\u2019t go slack at the sight\u2014most women had a hard time resisting Alexei, even when he wasn\u2019t trying to charm. \u201cNo time for play,\u201d he said, and the entire room snapped to attention. \u201cWe have the same two choices we did earlier this year. Strike first or wait for them to come to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrike first and we might have a slight advantage,\u201d Tom\u00e1s said, dark eyes incisive, \u201cbut if we send out teams, we leave our territory vulnerable. Could be exactly what they want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed.\u201d Judd\u2019s practical voice. \u201cAside from that, while the compound in South America won\u2019t be an issue, we don\u2019t know how many other operatives the Scotts have under their command.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Riaz added, \u201cwe know they\u2019re coming. This assault was an attempt to get us to retaliate, squander our resources. They want to soften us up before they attack.\u201d</p><p>Matthias nodded from one of the comm screens, the rugged beauty of the Cascade Range visible from the window at his back. \u201cOur previous strikes made sense at the time, but things have changed. I say we wait, we prepare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to check something else, too,\u201d Riley said from beside Hawke. \u201cAll indications are that they\u2019re focusing their aggression on SnowDancer and DarkRiver, but we need to make sure they haven\u2019t also got plans in place for the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny luck tracking down the weapons?\u201d Matthias asked.</p><p>Riley gave a grim shake of his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir past actions,\u201d Judd said, \u201cwould seem to suggest they won\u2019t destroy San Francisco, but given Henry\u2019s recent behavior, there\u2019s a possibility he and Shoshanna may be willing to sacrifice the city if it wins them the war.\u201d</p><p>Cooper agreed, his face set in hard lines as he looked out from the comm screen. \u201cFact is, they get us and the cats out, there\u2019s only Nikita and Anthony left to stand in their way. And neither has any significant military strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d Drew pointed out, \u201cit might not be a bad idea to scope those two out, see how many offensive Psy abilities they might be able to add to the mix. Even if it\u2019s a few powerful telepaths, they can help hold off the mental strikes of the other side. Anthony\u2019s people might even be able to predict some of the moves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve already asked,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cSeems war throws predictions off course because so many things are done in the heat of the moment. But he says every one of his foreseers, Faith included, are certain the violence is set to hit soon. Might even be a matter of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo\u201d\u2014Indigo leaned forward\u2014\u201cwe take a stand?\u201d</p><p>Hawke nodded. \u201cThe more we spread out, the thinner the wall they have to breach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar better to dig in and make them dig us out,\u201d Jem agreed, her blonde hair dull in the cloud-drenched light in her part of the state.</p><p>\u201cThat leads us to another question.\u201d Riley tapped the twisted piece of metal he\u2019d placed on the table when the meeting began. \u201cAccording to our records, the single star is Kaleb Krychek\u2019s personal emblem. We decided he wasn\u2019t involved in this, but what if he\u2019s playing everyone for fools?\u201d</p><p>They all looked to Judd. Who picked up the fragment of hull and turned it over in his fingers. \u201cKaleb is difficult to predict, but my gut says this is a deliberate attempt to implicate him, confuse the picture.\u201d</p><p>Indigo took the piece of debris from her fellow lieutenant. \u201cAny way to confirm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Luc to call Nikita,\u201d Hawke said, still put on edge by the idea of any kind of a relationship with a Psy Councilor. But distrust aside, they agreed on one thing\u2014this region was theirs, and they would hold it.</p><p>Glancing at Sienna, he gave a nod. \u201cThere\u2019s something else you all need to hear.\u201d</p><p>SIENNA had spoken to Councilors without flinching, grown up with an Arrow for an uncle, and had just spent the night with a wolf alpha. Yet her throat was dry, her tongue threatening to tie itself into a thousand knots. Because of Hawke. Because by bringing her into this, he\u2019d tied his pride to hers.</p><p>With that thought came the sense of balance she needed. No matter what she\u2019d said this morning, the truth was, she loved him, and in a way that wouldn\u2019t allow distance, not even if that distance would save her pain. He wouldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t, accept her as his mate, but she would give him everything. It was the only way she knew how to be.</p><p>\u201cSienna,\u201d he said as she rose so everyone could see her, \u201ctell the others what you told me.\u201d</p><p>She laid out her theory about the likelihood of an ambush targeting SnowDancer\u2019s most vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cYou sound very confident,\u201d Cooper said. It was the first time they\u2019d ever spoken, though she\u2019d seen him in passing when he visited the den. The jagged scar on his left cheek was a distinctive marker against his bronze skin, but it was the near black of his eyes that held her attention. \u201cI respect your intelligence, but you\u2019re young and you\u2019re no longer in the Net.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t shy, because if there was one thing she understood, it was war. More, she\u2019d lived in the dark long enough not to discount even the most sickening of possibilities. The wolves had a primal core of honor they didn\u2019t realize, just didn\u2019t expect certain actions. \u201cI know you\u2019re working on the assumption that it\u2019s Henry and Shoshanna Scott behind this,\u201d she said, \u201cand they do appear to be the primary aggressors from what I\u2019ve picked up. However, the strategy? It\u2019s pure Ming LeBon.\u201d</p><p>Judd shook his head. \u201cNothing points to Ming being involved. According to both Nikita and Anthony, he spoke against the Scotts on the Council.\u201d</p><p>Under normal circumstances, Sienna would\u2019ve bowed to Judd\u2019s experience, but her uncle hadn\u2019t spent ten years with Ming, hadn\u2019t lived and breathed the Councilor\u2019s ideas of military tactics, hadn\u2019t seen the many faces he was able to wear with ease. \u201cHenry Scott,\u201d she said, focusing on the facts, \u201chas done a number of aggressive things over the past year, but he\u2019s never approached anything of this magnitude.</p><p>\u201cWhatever happened to turn him aggressive, he doesn\u2019t have the training or the skill to pull off such a big military op without serious help.\u201d While she didn\u2019t mention it right then, she was starting to have the disturbing feeling that Ming had been involved in the previous incursions on SnowDancer land as well\u2014in truth, he may well have given Henry a \u201cguiding hand\u201d for longer than anyone knew.</p><p>Jem spoke for the first time, frown lines marring her brow. \u201cShe\u2019s right. I\u2019ve sort of made a hobby of keeping track of the Council\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome hobby,\u201d Riaz muttered, scratching at the bandage hidden under his chocolate brown shirt\u2014until Indigo reached over with a pen and tapped the back of his hand.</p><p>\u201cYeah, real scintillating stuff.\u201d Jem rolled her eyes and carried on. \u201cA couple of years back, Henry was linked, in most cases, to things Shoshanna spearheaded. It\u2019s obvious that\u2019s changed, but I\u2019m with Sienna. No way he\u2019s become a military mastermind all of a sudden.\u201d</p><p>Hawke turned those wolf-pale eyes to Judd. \u201cWe need more data from the PsyNet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood\u2014but I can\u2019t go to my contact with this.\u201d</p><p>Having had a very interesting conversation with Judd a few months ago, where the Arrow had trusted him with the identity of the Ghost, Hawke wasn\u2019t surprised. The lieutenant had shared the name because he\u2019d wanted Hawke to be able to understand some of his decisions without further explanation, to be able to filter his responses through the lens of knowledge.</p><p>\u201cNot worried about me being compromised?\u201d Hawke had asked, aware of the lengths the Council would go to uncover the rebel\u2019s identity.</p><p>\u201cNo. If they capture you, they\u2019ll kill you. Even Psy know not to mess with certain predators.\u201d</p><p>Now, Hawke said, \u201cDo the best you can.\u201d</p><p>Glancing at Sienna, he saw her tense her shoulders, rise to interrupt the buzz of conversation. \u201cThere is,\u201d she said, \u201ca foolproof way to figure out if my theory about their plans is correct.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hawke glanced at Riley. \u201cWe got the manpower to hold the perimeter while we do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can ask a few of the cats to cover. Riaz can do the same for me in the den since Lara\u2019s ordered him not to rip his stitches out on pain of healer wrath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen,\u201d Hawke said, holding Sienna\u2019s gaze, \u201clet\u2019s do it.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter 38</p><p>IT WAS NOT wholly unexpected when Kaleb responded to Nikita\u2019s message by teleporting into her office only minutes later. When you were the most powerful Tk in the Net, such things required a negligible use of power. His gaze zeroed in on the twisted piece of metal on her desk before she could say a word. \u201cI see,\u201d he said, taking a seat in the chair on the other side of the glass expanse.</p><p>The chair was positioned an inch lower than her own, meant to put visitors at a psychological disadvantage. Of course, none of them were Kaleb Krychek.</p><p>She watched him examine the metal, conscious that he could lie with such smooth ease she\u2019d never pick it up. He might have been an ally of sorts, but she never forgot that the man across from her had been in the control of a true psychopath from a young age\u2014there was no way to know what echoes Santano Enrique had left in his psyche.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said at last, \u201cwhat do you think?\u201d Cardinal eyes watched her without blinking.</p> <p>\u201cI think you\u2019re too smart to mark your assault craft with your emblem,\u201d she said. \u201cI also think you\u2019re smart enough to do precisely that to throw us off the trail.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. It meant nothing, she knew, was a physical action he\u2019d learned to mimic to manipulate the human and changeling masses. \u201cTrue,\u201d he said. \u201cAll true.\u201d Returning the piece of hull to her desk, he looked out at the city through the plate-glass window at her back. \u201cHowever, while the squad is mine, I do not yet own them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need the Arrows.\u201d Notwithstanding his telekinetic abilities, Kaleb had independent command over hundreds of men.</p><p>\u201cStill, it makes no rational sense to strike now when I could go in later with a force almost guaranteed to take control with very little destruction.\u201d Rising, he did up a button on his jacket, the material a deep navy featuring razor-thin pinstripes, the cut perfect. \u201cThe fact is, I don\u2019t want this city. That has never been my goal.\u201d</p><p>That, Nikita thought, was the most honest thing he could\u2019ve said. Kaleb had far grander ambitions\u2014he wanted to control the Net itself. Not taking her eyes off him as he gave a clipped nod before teleporting away, she reached for the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s not Kaleb,\u201d she told Max Shannon, aware the changelings felt more at ease dealing with her security chief.</p><p>But when she hung up, she didn\u2019t return to her work. Instead, she reached out with her psychic senses along an old and familiar telepathic pathway. Your child. She is healthy.</p> <p>Yes, Sascha answered, though it hadn\u2019t been a question. She is extraordinary.</p><p>Half-Psy, half-changeling\u2014that in itself made Sascha\u2019s words true, but Nikita knew that wasn\u2019t what her daughter meant. You\u2019re not safe in the city. Not with war lingering on the horizon.</p><p>It\u2019s home, Mother. A long pause. Do you plan to leave this region?</p><p>No.</p><p>A push along the telepathic pathway, and she realized Sascha was trying to send her something bigger than a direct thought. Aware her daughter\u2019s Tp was weak, she reached out with her own, \u201ccaught\u201d the sending in a psychic grasp . . . and saw an image of an infant with cat-green eyes and skin of a smooth golden-brown a shade paler than her mother\u2019s.</p><p>Sascha\u2019s child. Nikita\u2019s grandchild.</p><p>Chapter 39</p><p>HAWKE SPOTTED THE ambush from a ridge high above the isolated road that lay along one of the routes they would\u2019ve used to evacuate their vulnerable. His wolf\u2019s anger turned cold, primal. There were some things you did not do even in war. \u201cWill they be able to sense non-Psy minds getting closer?\u201d he asked the male lying on his stomach beside him.</p> <p>Judd gave a single nod. \u201cYou might be able to distract them by sending in a decoy\u2014fill up a transport with soldiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t tell the difference between immature and mature minds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if they\u2019re running a general telepathic sweep.\u201d He lifted the binoculars to his eyes again. \u201cI can make out the weapons. They\u2019re high-velocity\u2014\u201d A dangerous pause before Judd passed the binoculars to him. \u201cTwenty degrees to the left of the man in the center.\u201d</p><p>Hawke scanned twenty degrees, stopped. The cold-blooded bastards had a grenade launcher. \u201cNo mercy. They die. All of them.\u201d This war was not going to be fought with the lives of their young and their old. \u201cScotts, Ming, whoever the fuck is behind this needs to know we mean business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe eliminate the ambush, we give away the fact that we\u2019re not only aware of their strategy, but capable of predicting it.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf was howling for blood, but both man and wolf had learned to think past the red haze of rage long ago. \u201cIt\u2019ll also get rid of ten of their men at this location, however many the others have found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndigo\u2019s team has another group in their sights,\u201d Judd reported on the heels of his statement, \u201cas does Drew\u2019s. Riley\u2019s sector looks clean.\u201d</p><p>It was, Hawke had to admit, damn convenient to have telepaths in the packs. Sienna was paired with Indigo, Walker with Drew, Riley with Faith NightStar of all people. While the DarkRiver F-Psy was a noncombatant, she had the necessary telepathic range. Her mate was acting as her shield.</p><p>Because of that telepathic network, it took only minutes to organize the decoys, another hour to get the transports in position. None of the vehicles could be allowed within range of the grenade launchers\u2014their purpose was simply to distract. In the interim, the changeling teams made their way down to just beyond the scope of the enemy\u2019s telepathic sweeps.</p><p>\u201cStay out of sight,\u201d Hawke told Judd. \u201cThey can\u2019t know we have a Tk on our side, not until it\u2019s unavoidable.\u201d Getting the lieutenant\u2019s nod, he said, \u201cEveryone ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty seconds till the vehicles come into view, fifty-two till mobilization.\u201d</p><p>It was a hard, fast battle. That was the only way to win with the Psy, given their ability to obliterate minds with their psychic strikes. There were also no teleport-capable telekinetics in this group, which signed their death warrants.</p><p>Afterward, Hawke stood looking down at the bodies and felt nothing but savage satisfaction. He wasn\u2019t a man who liked to kill, but these people had planned to savage SnowDancer\u2019s young. For that crime, death was the only penalty.</p><p>SIENNA had never seen the wolves move with such cold, sleek violence. The Psy units stood no chance. Part of her was shocked at the bloody reprisal, but it was nothing to the protective rage that had filled her when she\u2019d seen the grenade launcher, understood the true malevolence of their intentions. For an instant, the X-fire had threatened to slip her grasp, but paradoxically, it was her protective drive toward the pups that had helped her get it back under control.</p><p>It was over in a matter of minutes, and as day turned to night, she found herself walking through the den with a man who had the eyes of a hunting wolf and hair of silver-gold. Today, he\u2019d not only spoken to her about pack issues, he\u2019d treated her as an integral element of SnowDancer\u2019s defenses. Part of her was still waiting for the other shoe to drop, but at that instant, for the first time, she felt like a partner in some sense, not simply a young girl who wore her heart on her sleeve.</p><p>\u201cThe cats are holding off on any evacuations, same as us,\u201d he told her as they walked. \u201cRight now, everyone is safer within our protections.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be quiet,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the children are eventually moved.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf hated the idea of a silent den. \u201cIt won\u2019t be forever.\u201d</p><p>Sienna began to turn left as they reached a fork in the corridor.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He gripped her hand. \u201cThis way.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t say a word, and neither did anyone else who saw them along the way. A few days ago, they\u2019d have been teased, whistled at, and otherwise hassled in the most playful of ways. Today, the mood was somber, everyone aware what was coming. The corridors were emptier than usual, many pack members having gathered in the common areas to talk, take strength from one another. There was no one at all in the corridor paved with river stones and painted with images of wolves at play, in sleep, during a hunt.</p><p>Hawke knew why Sienna avoided this particular exit from the den. She\u2019d damaged the mural once by accident, her X-fire acting as a laser to fracture a small area of the wall, destroy the paint. \u201cI was never angry with you for that,\u201d he said as they entered the painted wonderland.</p><p>\u201cThis place . . . it\u2019s important to you.\u201d Her hand curled around his.</p><p>Tugging her to a particular section, he said, \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>Sienna leaned forward. \u201cIt\u2019s a sleeping pup\u2014Oh!\u201d He watched as she traced the second pup hiding behind the broad green leaves, waiting to pounce. \u201cI never noticed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hid a lot of things in the mural,\u201d he said, the ache inside him an old grief. \u201cIt was meant to be an artwork that made the pack laugh, linger, want to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking to the heart of the wolf.\u201d Dropping her hand from the wall, Sienna raised her head. \u201cIt was your mother, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His gifted, laughing mother. \u201cShe was a submissive wolf.\u201d</p><p>Sienna\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI just assumed . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it surprised my father, too.\u201d Inside, his wolf howled at the bittersweet memories. \u201cHe first saw her here. She\u2019d flown in from a different sector, started the mural only hours earlier.\u201d Hawke could almost see her, her white-blonde hair tied back with one of those colorful scarves she\u2019d favored, a streak of paint on her nose or across her cheek. \u201cHe came running through from the outside in wolf form with an urgent message for Garrick. And he just stopped.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe knew straight away?\u201d Wonder in Sienna\u2019s voice.</p><p>It made Hawke tighten his fingers on her own. \u201cHe said it was like being hit by a two-by-four.\u201d His father had always shaken his head at the memory, laughter creasing his face, lighting up eyes two shades darker than his son\u2019s. \u201cHe was covered in mud and he had somewhere to go, but all he could do was stare at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your mother do?\u201d</p> <p>Hawke laughed, recalling the way his mother would always pretend to bare her teeth at his father when she told her side of the story. \u201cShe dropped half a tub of green paint on herself when he came racing in and had turned around to give him a piece of her mind when the air just went out of her. She was submissive, should\u2019ve dropped her gaze, but she couldn\u2019t do it, couldn\u2019t break that connection.</p><p>\u201cGarrick found them an hour later, her splattered with paint, him with dried mud turning his coat stiff. They were just sitting there, looking into each other\u2019s eyes. Their mating was complete, and it was one that held firm until the last.\u201d Until his father\u2019s death and his mother\u2019s heartbreak.</p><p>Unable to continue speaking of it, he tugged her out of the den and to the pool below the waterfall, its surface a frothy white from the crash of the water. Shadowed by the jut of the cliff above, the sandy area was a haven of privacy.</p><p>\u201cThis is a makeout spot,\u201d Sienna said as she finished clambering down. \u201cEvie told me. I think Tai sneaks her here.\u201d</p><p>His lips tugged upward. \u201cWhy do you think I moved that rock at the top? It\u2019s a time-honored signal that the pool is occupied.\u201d The stresses of the day falling away under the caress of her responding smile, he took a seat on the ground. \u201cDid you manage to see your family today?\u201d He tugged her close when she settled next to him.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I spent time with Marlee and Toby after we returned, but Walker was busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Walker,\u201d he murmured in her ear, \u201cI saw him glaring at Lara a few minutes ago.\u201d Hawke had slipped away before either of them had seen him, certain the Psy male would take care of the healer. They\u2019d had a few injuries today, and she was already worn thin after the events of the previous night.</p><p>\u201cWalker doesn\u2019t glare,\u201d Sienna said, shifting so that she faced him on her knees. \u201cHe just looks at you until you obey.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Hawke moved to bracket her between his thighs and touched his forehead to hers, oddly content. They talked of other matters, of Toby and Marlee, of Cooper and his new mate, until Hawke ended up lying next to her seated form, his arms crossed under his head. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have four lieutenants mated now,\u201d he said, his eyes on the rocky ledge above, but his attention on the compelling, textured scent of the woman by his side. \u201cWe\u2019ll need that stability in the leadership structure even more after this is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I ask about her?\u201d A quiet, unexpected question.</p><p>The wolf was very much in Hawke\u2019s eyes when he glanced at Sienna. \u201cHer name was Theresa, but I called her Rissa.\u201d</p> <p>Rissa. It was strange to finally know the name of the ghost who owned Hawke\u2019s soul. \u201cWhat was she like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet\u2014in nature and in spirit.\u201d Hawke\u2019s hair slid over his forehead as he pushed himself back up into a sitting position, arms hooked around his knees. \u201cEven as a toddler, she\u2019d give her toys to other kids if they cried. I never saw her throw a tantrum, never saw her without a smile.\u201d</p><p>Sienna clenched her hands in the sand. It was becoming plain that Hawke\u2019s Rissa had been nothing like her. \u201cIt\u2019s why you\u2019re drawn to Sascha,\u201d she said, hiding her pain, hiding everything. \u201cShe must remind you of Theresa in some way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d He frowned, shoved back his hair. \u201cThe thing is, I don\u2019t know what Rissa would\u2019ve grown up to be\u2014she never had the chance to spread her wings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you\u2019re certain she would\u2019ve been your mate?\u201d It just slipped out, that plea disguised as a question.</p><p>A pause. \u201cThat can\u2019t be altered, Sienna.\u201d Gentle words. Implacable words. \u201cIt\u2019s a knowing nothing can erase.\u201d</p><p>She fisted her hand against her abdomen in a vain attempt to hold the pain inside. \u201cI can\u2019t argue with that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the fact is, you never mated with her.\u201d They\u2019d been too young to love that way.</p><p>\u201cThe wolf chooses only once.\u201d Curving his hand over her nape, he pulled her close, until his lips almost brushed her own as he spoke. \u201cI can\u2019t change that, baby.\u201d</p> <p>Gut-deep need drove her response. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty excuse, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Eyes gone night-glow, dangerous and merciless. \u201cEnough, Sienna.\u201d Squeezing her nape, he released her.</p><p>She wondered if he thought that was the end of it. \u201cIt tore your heart out when you lost her,\u201d she said, insistent because she had to be, because this was important enough to forever break her. \u201cIt devastated you when you were a child\u2014is it any wonder that you refuse to allow yourself to be that vulnerable again?\u201d</p><p>Rising to his feet, he strode to the edge of the pool, glanced back. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk the truth away, no matter how many words you use.\u201d</p><p>She got up, too, bracing herself against the dominant force of his personality. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the effects of the mating bond,\u201d she said, looking into that face shaped by adversity and determination, until he was a man few dared challenge. \u201cI can understand why a changeling who\u2019d been mated once would never ever seek the same with anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why the hell are we having this conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you weren\u2019t mated! \u201d Her voice rose in spite of her vow to keep this discussion tempered, rational. \u201cHave you ever considered that it isn\u2019t the wolf stopping you from mating, but the human half?\u201d The part that understood that to open himself up to the chance of a mate would mean opening himself up to the chance of the same soul-shattering pain.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a choice.\u201d He looked like he wanted to shake her.</p><p>Sienna wanted to pound at him with her fists, force him to listen, to see. \u201cBullshit! Drew made Indigo see him, Brenna fought for Judd, Mercy and Riley\u2019s relationship took years to grow, so don\u2019t you dare take the easy way out by saying it\u2019s all predestined! Don\u2019t be a coward!\u201d</p><p>Chapter 40</p><p>SOMEONE HAD OUTTHOUGHT him, Ming realized, switching off the comm after a clipped discussion with Henry Scott. There weren\u2019t many people on the planet capable of doing that, especially when it involved military strategy.</p><p>Sienna Lauren was on the shortlist.</p><p>He\u2019d suspected she was alive ever since he\u2019d seen the report filed by one of Henry\u2019s men, flagging a curious psychic energy pulse inside SnowDancer territory. The description of that pulse hadn\u2019t sounded odd to Ming\u2014it described the power of an X. While his team had failed to get the SnowDancers to admit to offering sanctuary to Psy defectors, today\u2019s events further strengthened his suspicions.</p><p>If Sienna had lasted this long, the girl had either figured out a way to circumvent the inevitable consequences of the X-marker, or she was about to go completely active. Since the former had never before been done, Ming was betting on the latter. Which meant everyone in the world would soon know if Sienna Lauren was alive. And Henry would get what he wanted after all\u2014carnage on a scale that would dwarf anything the Council had ever done.</p><p>Chapter 41</p><p>GOD, SHE MADE him angry. Two hours after the confrontation by the pool, Hawke remained pissed at Sienna. Maybe he should\u2019ve felt some softer emotion\u2014perhaps even pity\u2014because she was asking for something he couldn\u2019t give, would never be able to give. But the fact of the matter was, she\u2019d made him steaming mad, and that was how he stayed. The only good thing was that driven by angry energy, he\u2019d canvassed almost everyone involved in making sure the pack was ready for any further assaults.</p><p>Riley had a few things he wanted to double-check, but he\u2019d already adapted the rotation schedule to take the injured into account\u2014and Matthias was on his way to the den with a unit of skilled fighters, as well as a sniper team trained by Alexei. The group was flying in under the radar by hopping onto a private plane owned by Nikita Duncan. Even if the enemy realized Nikita was assisting the changelings, the plane\u2019s true ownership was hidden behind so many sub-corporations that no one would give it more than a cursory glance. Territorially speaking, the other lieutenants would cover Matthias\u2019s sector.</p><p>Indigo\u2019s novices were drilled and well able to provide the necessary support if needed, while Riaz had inventoried their weapons and pronounced that everything was in pristine shape. In the best news of the day, the techs had found enough in the wreckage of the Psy stealthcraft that they\u2019d complete the modifications to the pack\u2019s air-detection systems tonight, plugging that security hole.</p><p>DarkRiver, too, had locked its defenses. Mercy\u2019s and Riley\u2019s work together meant that instead of doubling up, the packs would function as a single cohesive unit in any attack. According to Lucas, Nikita and Anthony had provided lists of their people who might prove helpful in any skirmish. The two Councilors would also utilize their own psychic abilities to assist.</p><p>\u201cIf it looks like the Scotts are going to hit San Francisco,\u201d Hawke said on the phone to the leopard alpha, \u201cwe position the Psy there.\u201d There was no way to evacuate the entire population of the city, which meant they\u2019d have a higher risk of sustaining casualties.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Lucas didn\u2019t sound convinced. \u201cHenry\u2019s going to throw his strongest at SnowDancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got weapons and a sizeable number of trained people.\u201d The leopards had charge of city security, but even they couldn\u2019t cover all of the vulnerable. \u201cIt might also free up some of my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have Vaughn work Anthony\u2019s and Nikita\u2019s people into the city\u2019s defenses, get back to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Everything, Hawke thought as he hung up, was either ready, or would be by tomorrow.

Weapons are being shifted into the hangar for loading.\u201d</p><p>Hawke knew Judd had rigged the hangar, so that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. \u201cJem sent in a report out of Los Angeles an hour ago,\u201d he said, frowning as Tai accidentally slammed into Sienna and they both tumbled into the mud below. Lara had healed the young male\u2019s fractured arm, the injury minor enough that it hadn\u2019t strained resources she needed to focus on the more badly hurt. \u201cLooks like the Scotts might\u2019ve gotten in more weapons and troops than we thought via the shipping routes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans they won\u2019t be hobbled by losing the camp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but it will have an impact, and more important, there\u2019s a strong chance it\u2019ll spur them to strike. If we can get them to do that before they\u2019re ready, it\u2019ll be to our advantage.\u201d He tracked Tai and Sienna as they joined forces to get over a stubborn obstacle. \u201cPush the switch when you think it the best time, just give us enough warning that we can hunker down for an assault.\u201d</p> <p>Judd nodded at the training run. \u201cYou\u2019ve factored Sienna into the equation?\u201d</p><p>Claws raked along the inside of his skin, drawing blood. \u201cI don\u2019t want her giving herself away unless it\u2019s necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not disregarding her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Judd raised a shoulder in a shrug. \u201cIt happens with predatory changeling males\u2014you do tend to be protective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook who\u2019s talking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do you think I fit in so well?\u201d</p><p>Hawke called Sienna into his office forty minutes later, after she\u2019d had a chance to clean up. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, tapping a spot on the map and restraining the urge to snarl at the memory of the words she\u2019d flung at him by the pool. \u201cIf there is an attack, you stand here, and you do not engage unless I give the order.\u201d</p><p>A crisp nod, no defiance. \u201cYou want to keep me as a surprise gambit as long as possible. I understand.\u201d Her words were calm, practical\u2014as if they\u2019d never had that fight.</p><p>His wolf peeled its lips back over predator-sharp teeth. \u201cPretending to be Silent, baby? Too late for that.\u201d</p><p>Flame, dangerous and hypnotic, crawled over the black of her eyes. \u201cWould you prefer I act the part of a hysterical female so you can write me off?\u201d</p><p>He gripped the edge of his desk. \u201cCareful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d A look that might as well have come from a pissed-off female wolf. \u201cI\u2019m not the one who seems unable to separate work and pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeeling bratty tonight, are you?\u201d It satisfied some deep part of him that he\u2019d gotten her riled up so fast\u2014he would never allow or accept distance from his woman.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d An unexpectedly serious response. \u201cDon\u2019t lessen my opinions by calling me a brat. And you know, don\u2019t call me baby either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think you can \u2018handle\u2019 me, Sienna,\u201d he said as the animal prowled to the surface of his mind, \u201cyou\u2019re looking at the wrong wolf.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we get back to work?\u201d Cool words that ruffled his fur the wrong way.</p><p>SIENNA didn\u2019t know how it happened. One minute, she was fighting off the blade of dissonance as she stared at the large, territorial map on Hawke\u2019s desk, with him on the other side, and the next he had a grip on her waist and was pulling her onto the solid bulk of the desk with a speed and strength that left her breathless. She found herself kneeling on the dark wood, her hands on his shoulders what felt like a millisecond later.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d But his hand was already on the back of her head, and she was being kissed until she couldn\u2019t breathe. Gasping in air when he drew back for the barest instant, she tried to prepare herself for the next kiss . . . but of course, there was way no way to prepare for Hawke.</p><p>He\u2019d touched her with exquisite tenderness when he\u2019d brought her to pleasure this morning, but at this instant, he was pure demanding wolf, nipping at her lower lip, sucking at her upper one, stroking his tongue inside her mouth until she knew she\u2019d carry the taste of him into her very dreams. As for his hands, one fisted in her hair, the other gripping her hip\u2014proprietary didn\u2019t even come close.</p><p>The temptation to submit was crushing. She\u2019d wanted him for so long, and now that he\u2019d given her the right to touch him, to hold him, she had to fight with her own hunger not to grab at the crumbs he offered. Maybe he was right, maybe they would never mate\u2014but she knew, she knew, that this man with his beautiful wild heart was capable of giving far more than he was willing to risk.</p><p>Wrenching away her head, she twisted out of his hold using a trick Indigo had taught her and ended up on her feet on the other side of the desk. \u201cHawke, there\u2019s\u2014\u201d !! The wordless warning from the primal part of her brain slammed through her a fraction too late\u2014he was already launching himself over the desk and toward her.</p><p>Instinct punched to the surface, and she found she\u2019d formed a wall of cold fire between them. He skidded to a halt on the other side, then angled his head in a move that was distinctly not human, touched his finger to the fire. A hissing breath, those wolf-pale eyes meeting hers through the rippling sheet of crimson flame licked with yellow. \u201cYou burned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said, shoving tangled strands of hair off her face as her heart thudded double-time, \u201cyou didn\u2019t seem to be willing to listen to reason.\u201d</p><p>Not giving her any warning, he thrust his arm through the cold fire. But she\u2019d already doused it and was out the door . . . to run headlong into a very hard, very wide male chest.</p><p>\u201cHey there, darling. Careful now.\u201d Strong, unfamiliar hands on her shoulders.</p><p>Feeling Hawke exit the office, she took her chances and twisted around behind the solid bulk of the man she belatedly recognized as Matthias, all dark, dark eyes and rich brown skin shaped over a face that held hints of so many cultures, it was impossible to define him as anything but stunning. The big lieutenant gave her an odd look but shifted to intercept Hawke when he went to move around Matthias.</p><p>Saying a silent thank-you, Sienna took to her heels. It was self-preservation. In his current mood, Hawke might get her to agree to anything he wanted . . . even an existence in which she would forever be second best.</p><p>WALKER was on his way out of the infirmary after having had a late dinner with Lara, when he saw Kieran about to head in. The handsome young soldier carried a bouquet of colorful blooms.</p><p>\u201cAre those for Lara?\u201d He didn\u2019t move out of the doorway.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I thought since she\u2019s been working so hard, it might be nice for her to have these in her office.\u201d A flashing smile. \u201cDo you think she\u2019ll like them?\u201d</p><p>Walker didn\u2019t have to think about his answer. \u201cShe won\u2019t be getting a chance to see them.\u201d</p><p>Kieran might\u2019ve been human, but he\u2019d grown up in a wolf pack. His gaze went flat with challenge. \u201cHow about we let Lara decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Walker held the other man\u2019s distinctive gray-green eyes until Kieran jerked his head away.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Fingers crushing the slender stems in his grip, he thrust the bouquet onto Walker\u2019s chest. \u201cYou might be more dominant, but I will skin you if you don\u2019t treat her the way she should be treated.\u201d</p><p>As Kieran stalked away, Walker looked at the crumpled flowers in his grasp and considered why he\u2019d felt compelled to keep the other man from getting anywhere near Lara. Kieran had only been trying to look after her in his own way. Except, Walker realized, he didn\u2019t want anyone else looking after the SnowDancer healer. Bringing her dinner when she worked late, making sure she got enough sleep, holding her when she cried, those were Walker\u2019s responsibilities.</p><p>. . . you don\u2019t have any other rights\u2014you didn\u2019t want them . . . They belong to the man with whom I\u2019ll build a life, have children.</p><p>She\u2019d been furious the night she\u2019d thrown those words at him but that made them no less true. So . . . either he backed off right now, or he asked for the rights he\u2019d once rejected. There was no guarantee she\u2019d say yes. In fact, there was a high chance she would refuse, having moved on in her personal life.</p><p>His hands clenched around the already bruised stems in his grasp.</p><p>HAWKE growled at Matthias as he sensed Sienna disappearing down the corridor. \u201cGet the hell out of my way,\u201d he said to the big lieutenant.</p><p>Matthias folded those arms, which were the size of small tree trunks, and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m only looking out for your dignity. Chasing women down the corridors is not done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll chase whomever I want.\u201d But the wolf\u2019s temper was retreating.</p><p>Matthias grinned. \u201cPretty little thing, your Psy. And fast. What\u2019d she do to get you in a hunting kind of mood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d Scowling, he jerked his head toward the office. \u201cSince you refuse to leave.\u201d</p><p>Matthias ambled in. \u201cNice to be here, even under these circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrimed and ready to go.\u201d Matthias raised an eyebrow at the mess on Hawke\u2019s desk but didn\u2019t comment. \u201cThey know den territory, but I\u2019ve got them doing a run to refamiliarize themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Make sure they don\u2019t overdo it\u2014I have a feeling the shit is going to hit the fan sooner rather than later, and I want them rested.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve told them an hour, no more.\u201d Smoothing out a wrinkled map after picking it up off the floor, Matthias put it on Hawke\u2019s desk with pointed care. \u201cAlexei says his snipers are ready if we can set them in position ahead of time. They\u2019re not trained to get themselves through enemy fire yet.\u201d</p><p>Hawke nodded. \u201cRiaz can handle that.\u201d The lieutenant was an excellent sharpshooter.</p><p>\u201cHave you made a decision about the den?\u201d Matthias asked, his expression now devoid of any humor.</p> <p>\u201cIt can\u2019t fall.\u201d Even if SnowDancer survived, seeing the enemy in their home would savage them. \u201cWe blow it up if necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to argue. No one will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but let\u2019s make sure it doesn\u2019t come to that by kicking their asses.\u201d</p><p>As it happened, things didn\u2019t go quite as expected.</p><p>\u201cSome kind of viral infection,\u201d Judd said to him the next day. \u201cEighty percent of the troops in the Pure Psy compound are down. From the medical chatter the techs were able to intercept, it looks like the bug\u2019s going to lay them out for three, maybe four days.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cConfirmed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Henry\u2019s not playing us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could hit the compound now,\u201d Indigo said when he pulled his lieutenants\u2014and Drew\u2014together for a meeting. \u201cForce Henry to move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but we still haven\u2019t discovered the weapons cache in the city,\u201d Riaz pointed out. \u201cThis could be our chance. Henry\u2019s people might get sloppy because of the delay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we don\u2019t find that cache,\u201d Judd said, \u201cand they strike, what they have in there could give them a decisive advantage.\u201d</p><p>In the end, it was decided that since eliminating the compound now as opposed to later didn\u2019t give either pack any tactical advantage, they\u2019d hold off and spend the extra time intensifying the search for the weapons. \u201cIf we do locate the cache,\u201d Riaz said, \u201cthe teams need to know not to let on.\u201d</p> <p>Alexei was the first to catch Riaz\u2019s meaning. \u201cIf Henry doesn\u2019t realize the warehouse has been compromised, he won\u2019t hesitate to launch the assault even after he loses the Pure Psy compound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Judd said. \u201cRiaz is right. Henry and his supporters won\u2019t mobilize if he feels they\u2019re at too much of a disadvantage.\u201d</p><p>That was not an option they wanted Henry to consider, because fact was, the packs couldn\u2019t remain at \u201cred\u201d status forever. It would wear out their people, leave them vulnerable when the assault did come.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll brief our teams and the Rats, too,\u201d Indigo said, then glanced at Judd. \u201cI meant to ask\u2014can Tks \u2019port in with bombs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cComponents, yes. Functional bombs, no. They\u2019re too unstable and tend to go off during the teleport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe vulnerable,\u201d Jem said to Hawke after Judd finished speaking. \u201cYou still planning to wait to evacuate them?\u201d</p><p>Hawke nodded. \u201cLess chance of Henry discovering their location and changing the focus of his attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been talking with Mercy,\u201d Riley said as Jem nodded, \u201cand we both realized that there\u2019s a last-ditch alternative if something goes wrong and we can\u2019t get the children and elders a good distance away.\u201d He pulled up a holographic map that showed the abandoned subway tunnels beneath San Francisco. \u201cWe get them down to the city\u2014Rats will make sure the enemy never finds them.\u201d</p> <p>Indigo shuddered. \u201cWolves inside those narrow tunnels? In the dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can tell them it\u2019s an adventure.\u201d Riley\u2019s voice was pragmatic. \u201cThe elders will make sure the young ones are okay. And it\u2019s not dark. The Rats have a nice setup down there\u2014better than you\u2019d believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy wolf\u2019s not a fan, but it\u2019s a good plan to have in hand,\u201d Hawke said, then looked around at his men and women. \u201cWe\u2019ll not only survive this, we\u2019ll come out of it stronger than we went in, because we have something the enemy can\u2019t imagine: heart.\u201d</p><p>RILEY waited until after Hawke had left the room with Andrew\u2014who\u2019d been told to make certain the alpha was the first to leave\u2014before speaking. \u201cI realize this isn\u2019t the best time,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we need to do something for Hawke.\u201d He told them his idea. \u201cIt needs to be finished before everything goes to shit. He deserves that much after everything he\u2019s done for the pack.\u201d They hadn\u2019t had time before, but the virus had just given them at least a three-day reprieve.</p><p>\u201cHe deserves a hell of a lot more,\u201d Indigo said to a round of nods, then grinned. \u201cHe\u2019ll fight better when he\u2019s not in such a bad mood anyway.\u201d</p><p>Matthias shook his head. \u201cI dunno, feral and mean is how I like him.\u201d But it was clear he was joking. \u201cTactically speaking, we\u2019re set\u2014so, hell yeah, we can take a few hours to complete this project.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pack\u2019s morale could use a boost, too,\u201d Riaz pointed out. \u201cOnce word gets out about this . . .\u201d His smile was broad.</p><p>Judd rose to his feet. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a done deal, you understand.\u201d Quiet, solemn words.</p><p>\u201cWe know.\u201d Tipping back his chair, Riaz met the other lieutenant\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut we have to hope. None of us likes the alternative.\u201d</p><p>Loneliness, Riley thought, absolute and unending, that was the alternative. No life for any wolf, but particularly not for an alpha who\u2019d given his blood, his sweat, and his soul to the pack since he\u2019d been little more than a child. \u201cThen we begin in an hour. I ordered the materials two weeks ago.\u201d Just in case.</p><p>Chapter 42</p><p>THE GHOST LOOKED down at what he\u2019d uncovered. To say that it was an unexpected development would be a distinct understatement. The next question, of course, was what he planned to do with his discovery.</p><p>He could let things lie in peace. No one would ever know. Nothing would change. That might be to his advantage. After all, there was a reason for this secret, things the Council didn\u2019t want the world to know\u2014but didn\u2019t want to lose, either. He could take and use that knowledge for himself.</p><p>Hunkering down beside the long, rectangular glass box coated with over a century of grime, he considered what Judd would say when he told him there was no second Eldridge manuscript.</p><p>Chapter 43</p><p>HAWKE WENT LOOKING for Sienna after the meeting because he could do nothing less. He found her sitting cross-legged in the White Zone with a sniffling pup in her arms. \u201cShh,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mean it. You know he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>More sniffles.</p><p>She stroked her fingers through the pup\u2019s soft brownish fur. \u201cDo you want to stay with me?\u201d</p><p>A decisive nod.</p><p>Smiling, Sienna bent to kiss the top of that furred head. \u201cWell, you can, but you know, I can\u2019t hide as good as your friends. I can\u2019t howl either.\u201d Her head lifted. \u201cLook who\u2019s come to ask you to play.\u201d</p><p>The pup pricked his ears, raised his head. Another pup shuffled over, gave an inviting \u201cyip,\u201d and nuzzled at his friend. As Hawke watched, Sienna murmured something to both of them, and the two pups touched noses before the one in her lap wriggled up and ran off with his playmate.</p><p>\u201cYou never talk to me as sweetly,\u201d he murmured, coming to crouch behind her.</p><p>A jerk and he knew she would\u2019ve gotten up if he hadn\u2019t slid his legs to either side of her, locking his arms around her body. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Sienna looked down at the box on Hawke\u2019s palm and felt her frustrated anger crumble like so much dust. The box was open, and it held a small mechanical toy\u2014a merry-go-round in motion, tiny lights flashing along the fluted roof and on the posts. There were five horses, each unique and painted in a vibrant splash of color. \u201cThis is one of yours,\u201d she said, knowing he wouldn\u2019t have had time to go to the toyshop.</p><p>\u201cNow it\u2019s yours.\u201d A kiss on her neck as the toy wound down. \u201cTake it.\u201d</p><p>Her nipples beaded against the cotton of her bra. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d He was doing it again, razing her defenses to steal her heart.</p><p>Teeth nipping at the sensitive lobe of her ear, making her jump. \u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I do.\u201d She touched a careful finger to the detailed face of a black horse with a blue and gold saddle. \u201cBut it\u2019s yours.\u201d</p><p>He put it on the grass beside them. \u201cI\u2019ll just leave it here then.\u201d</p><p>Stubborn, stubborn man. She knew he\u2019d go through with it, too. \u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered. \u201cWhy are you giving this to me? Why are you here when you\u2019re angry at me?\u201d</p><p>A long, quiet breath, his arms hugging her against the muscled breadth of a chest she\u2019d ached with missing last night. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you, baby. Never would I hurt you\u2014but I can\u2019t give you what I don\u2019t have to give.\u201d</p><p>A single tear trickled down her cheek at that solemn statement raw with tenderness. Her heart, her damned vulnerable heart, had been his from the day she understood what it was he incited within her. She had no true shields against him. Never had. Never would. \u201cThen give me everything else,\u201d she whispered, because while she could fight a ghost, she couldn\u2019t fight the truth in his voice. \u201cGive me not only your joy, but also your sorrow, your hurt. Treat me as\u2014\u201d She hesitated, because the word mate was a painful wound between them.</p><p>\u201c\u2014as my partner, as mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Maybe she would always be second best, but pride was no defense against the soul-deep need she had to claim him, be claimed by him. And if a part of her heart broke at the acceptance, she was old enough to put it away, where it wouldn\u2019t poison the life she could have with this man who was, and always would be, her one and only.</p><p>\u201cMy father\u2019s name was Tristan,\u201d Hawke said, the words rusty and cracked with age as he rose and pulled Sienna up with him to a more private part of the forest. She was right. They would never have the mating bond, but they could build their own, strong as steel and as unbreakable. \u201cHe was taken while he was on solitary watch in the mountains.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tristan had been a lone wolf before he mated, but afterward, he\u2019d preferred to remain near his mate, had grumbled about being away. Beyond the primal draw of the mating bond, his parents had loved each other and their son. Hawke had grown up petted and secure of his place in the world, but not spoiled, not with a lieutenant for a father. At four years of age, he remembered thinking, That\u2019s who I want to be when I grow up.</p><p>\u201cMy mother,\u201d he continued, despite the rock of memory crushing his chest, \u201cfelt something through the mating bond on the second day, so Garrick sent out a search party. By the time they found him\u201d\u2014found his strong, proud father\u2014\u201che\u2019d been missing a week, and it appeared he\u2019d had a bad fall. He recovered from the wounds fast enough, but he came back . . . damaged.\u201d The only time Tristan had touched his son after his return from the mountains was as he lay bleeding to death on the snow. \u201cHe attacked Garrick two weeks later.\u201d</p><p>Sienna\u2019s hand spread out over his heart, as if she would shield him. \u201cThey programmed him to assassinate your alpha.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. He was the final one taken.\u201d That knowledge had maddened him as a boy\u2014until he understood that his father had been a dominant, a protector, would\u2019ve never wanted anyone else to suffer in his place. \u201cThere\u2019d been trouble in the pack on and off for over two years. Pack members acting erratic, constant fights that led to deaths, men getting violent against their women.\u201d To this day, the idea of it agitated his wolf. \u201cThat isn\u2019t who we are, who we ever were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Sienna lifted up her head, such intense empathy on her face that it seemed impossible she\u2019d once been Silent. \u201cIt had to do with the experiment, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He tightened his arms around her. \u201cThey wanted to see if they could erode the bonds that held a changeling pack together by pressing on \u2018key factors\u2019 until the pack imploded.\u201d The bastards had broken juveniles as well as adults, poisoned so many good men and women.</p><p>\u201cIt was designed by a small fringe group of scientists.\u201d In the end, that was what had saved SnowDancer, because the survivors had been able to cut off the head of the evil before the data was passed on to the higher echelons. \u201cThey weren\u2019t Council, but they felt free to treat us like lab animals because the Council at the time made it clear that that\u2019s what they considered us.\u201d</p><p>Sienna wrapped her arms around him in the fiercest of embraces.</p> <p>Widening his stance, he tucked her impossibly closer. \u201cMy father, he went out saying \u2018fuck you\u2019 to the bastards.\u201d A grim smile. \u201cDuring the fight, when another one of the turned tried to shoot Garrick, he shifted to take the bullet.\u201d It had been too late though, the alpha\u2019s injuries severe enough that their already weak healer had been unable to save him.</p><p>Sienna shook her head against him. \u201cHe must\u2019ve been extraordinarily strong to fight the compulsion enough to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His father had clawed back his honor at the very end and, in so doing, taught Hawke to never, ever surrender.</p><p>\u201cI am so proud of you.\u201d Tristan\u2019s final words to his son as Hawke knelt beside him on the bloodstained snow, his hand gripping his father\u2019s in angry desperation.</p><p>Then, as blood continued to pulse out of his chest, Tristan had met his mate\u2019s tender kiss, whispered, \u201cUntil the next life, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother, Aren, simply couldn\u2019t function after he died. She tried so hard, but one day, she went to sleep and didn\u2019t wake up.\u201d Always for him, the joy he\u2019d felt in his parents\u2019 arms would be forever bound with echoes of pain, of loss.</p> <p>Sienna, this Psy who\u2019d lost her own mother, rose up on tiptoe and wrapped her arms around his neck in silent comfort, her cheeks tear-wet against his own when he bent to meet her halfway. Hawke had never cried for the loss of his parents. Not as a boy. Not as a man. Now, as he buried his face in a fall of silk as dark as midnight rubies, the wolf raised its head in a silent, mournful howl.</p><p>WALKER closed the door to the medical storage room behind himself and glanced down the packed rows. According to Lucy, Lara was in here somewhere.</p><p>\u201cWalker?\u201d A tumble of corkscrew curls as she leaned out from where she appeared to be sitting on the floor. \u201cIs that coffee I smell?\u201d</p><p>Wanting to smile at the greed in her voice, when smiling remained an act that didn\u2019t come naturally to him, he went down on one knee beside her. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cInventory,\u201d she said with a groan, leaning her head against his chest. \u201cI want to double-check we have all the essential supplies since we have a fraction more room to breathe.\u201d</p><p>He passed her the coffee, watched her drink. As always, it caused an inexplicable sensation in his chest to know that he was caring for her. \u201cEnough?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Putting the mug on a shelf above her, he fought the compulsion to thrust his hands into the silken warmth of her curls, pull her close. Lara was changeling, and changelings needed touch, needed sensual contact. The incident with Kieran had made him realize he didn\u2019t want any other man looking after Lara in that arena either.</p> <p>\u201cWalker?\u201d Lara lifted a questioning eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cAre you dating anyone right now?\u201d</p><p>She went immobile. \u201cNo.\u201d Her answer hung in the air.</p><p>\u201cI want those rights, Lara.\u201d If she said no, Walker had the sudden realization that he wouldn\u2019t back off like a civilized man.</p><p>He saw from the way she sucked in a breath that she understood the reference. \u201cYou already have most of those rights as my friend. What would change?\u201d</p><p>He was no wolf, but he didn\u2019t need to be to understand the challenge from her changeling heart. It was instinct to drop his head, to tug at her hair and arch her neck, to take her lips with his own. He\u2019d never kissed a woman before Lara\u2014such things were simply not done in the PsyNet. He found, however, that he understood the mechanics of it quite well even after a single prior experience.</p><p>Lara\u2019s lips were soft under his, and they parted on a gasp when he ran his tongue along the seam. She tasted of a sweet femininity that was already tied to his thoughts of her, but there was a hint of something darker beneath, a deep vein of sensuality. It made him hunger. If, he thought, he planned to be selfish and keep her all to himself in spite of the fact that he wasn\u2019t in any way good enough for her, he might as well indulge.</p><p>Tugging her more firmly against him, he stroked his tongue to hers, felt her hands clench against his chest, her body strain against his own. He repeated the act, wanting to incite further caresses from her. This time, Lara moaned, a low, pleasure-drenched sound that made his erection tighten to a near-painful level.</p><p>When she pushed at him, he frowned but released her. Seeing she needed to gasp in a breath, he allowed her a moment, then took her mouth again. No wonder changelings and humans were so greedy with this act. It created the most decadent sensations, especially with Lara\u2019s fine-boned jaw under his fingertips, the little sounds she made in her throat humming over his skin.</p><p>She pushed again, and he would\u2019ve stopped only long enough to allow her to draw in air again except that she put her fingers over his mouth. \u201cWalker, stop.\u201d</p><p>He went motionless. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, yes. Wait.\u201d Shoving her hands through her hair, Lara took several rough breaths in an effort to get her mind back into gear. \u201cI need to know exactly what you\u2019re asking for, what you\u2019re offering,\u201d she said. \u201cNo blurred lines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA permanent, exclusive relationship,\u201d he said without an instant\u2019s pause, his eyes locked on her. \u201cMe and you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to be sure.\u201d She was so vulnerable to him that he could destroy her. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something we can come back from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain.\u201d An implacable look. \u201cDo you need time to come to a decision?\u201d</p><p>It would\u2019ve been smarter to say yes, to allow them both to cool off. But she was a predatory changeling wolf with a man she\u2019d craved for so long, a man who was offering himself to her in a way dominant men rarely did. She tugged him down with her hands in his shirt.</p><p>His mouth took control within seconds.</p><p>There was no knowing how long he might have kept on tasting her if there hadn\u2019t been a knock at the door, a yelled-out request for assistance. Her lips were wet when they parted, her breath coming in jerky gasps, his eyes translucent green in the low light inside the storeroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of flowers do you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmaryllis,\u201d Lara had said in response to that out-of-the-blue question, and now, only hours later, what did she have on her desk but a vase of glorious blooms red as velvet cake and as luxuriant.</p><p>Swinging past the office, Lucy backtracked, whistled. \u201cThe quiet ones always have the best surprises up their sleeves.\u201d</p><p>Quiet. Yes, Walker was quiet. He was also a very fast learner. Her fingers lifted to her lips, dropped guiltily when she saw the clock and figured out she\u2019d been mooning over the flowers for ten minutes. But she couldn\u2019t resist one last touch.</p><p>Walker had kissed her.</p><p>Walker had sent her flowers.</p><p>Walker was courting her.</p><p>\u201cLara.\u201d</p><p>She jumped as his voice came to life behind her, and knocked a crystal paperweight to the floor. The green and blue spiral, which Ava had brought back from New Zealand, smashed into at least five different pieces. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI startled you. I apologize.\u201d Hunkering down, he began to pick up the fragments.</p><p>Her hand went to his shoulder without her conscious volition, spreading on the flex of muscle. \u201cI should\u2019ve scented you but\u201d\u2014his head lifting, the look in his eyes stealing her breath\u2014\u201cthe flowers are so beautiful. I was distracted.\u201d</p><p>All the pieces in his hand, he rose. \u201cI can fix this for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d she said, her wolf quivering with impatience to know why he\u2019d come. \u201cOnce broken, some things can\u2019t be fixed. I\u2019d rather you spend that time with me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was only later, after he\u2019d left her with a slow, deliberate kiss that curled her toes that Lara wondered if she\u2019d prophesied her own heartbreak. Because Walker Lauren might\u2019ve kissed her, might\u2019ve given her flowers, might even be courting her, but there remained a deep reserve to him. The distance was a solemn reminder that strong, steady Walker\u2019s capacity to trust had been broken into far more pieces than her crystal paperweight.</p><p>HAWKE asked Sienna to move into his quarters that night, but she needed a little more time to accustom herself to . . . everything. To what she\u2019d gained, what she\u2019d never have, what the future held. So she asked him to sleep in her bed.</p><p>Emotions chaotic, her muscles tensed as he curled himself around her. But he kissed her pulse, said, \u201cSleep. I just want to hold you.\u201d</p> <p>It took her an hour to obey, but when she did, she fell into a deep, dreamless slumber. She woke to find him gone, but he\u2019d left a note commanding her to meet him for dinner at seven. Honestly, she thought with a smile, he couldn\u2019t help with the orders.</p><p>It was that smile she carried into the day, rather than a heart heavy with the echo of loss. The decision had been made and accepted. To rail against it would only poison the beauty of what existed between her and her wolf. After showering, she dressed and grabbed some breakfast before going to stand her shift on the watch rotation. The pack was on high alert, and Sienna never once dropped her guard, but except for the short period when Evie came down to join her for lunch, the day passed about as fast as the average tortoise.</p><p>Returning to the den at last, she helped Toby and Marlee with their homework, then went to her room to clean up and ready herself for dinner. Wrapped in a robe, she was staring into her closet when there was a knock on her door. \u201cIndigo,\u201d she said, letting the lieutenant inside. \u201cDid you need me for something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvie said you had a date with Hawke.\u201d At Sienna\u2019s nod, Indigo passed her a flat box she\u2019d carried into the room. \u201cA woman needs to pull out the big guns when dealing with a man like him.\u201d</p><p>Sienna opened the box after the other woman had left with a grin and a hug, to find a simple black dress with spaghetti straps and a hemline that would come to a couple of inches above her knees. Then she put it on. Lusciously soft and silky, the material skimmed over her body with such faithfulness, it appeared as if she\u2019d been poured into it. Not only did it shape her behind, the bodice cupped and plumped up her breasts in the most sensual of offerings. All of it done with flawless elegance.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, Indigo,\u201d Sienna said, feeling sexy and bold and confident. Pairing the dress with delicate, heeled evening sandals, she dried and left her hair unbound. Hawke liked running his hands through it, and since he let her play with the thick silver-gold that fascinated her so, it was only fair.</p><p>The knock came just as she finished running the gloss over her mouth. \u201cYou\u2019re ten minutes early.\u201d</p><p>The wolf on the other side of the threshold stroked his eyes oh-so-slowly down her body. \u201cYou look bitable.\u201d</p><p>Her hand clenched on the door, because she knew full well he meant it when he said things like that. \u201cYou\u2019re dressed up.\u201d She\u2019d never seen him in anything but jeans.</p><p>Tonight, he wore a black-on-black suit that threw the vivid coloring of his eyes and hair into shocking relief, the shirt open at the collar. But though he looked like he could\u2019ve walked out of a spread in some fancy men\u2019s magazine, there was no hiding the predatory glint in that gaze.</p><p>Leaning forward without warning, he fisted his hands in her hair to take her mouth in a kiss that made it clear he considered her his. All his. Every inch of her. Her nipples went tight, her thighs clenching in a futile attempt to ease the ache in between. From the satisfied smile on his lips when he drew back, she knew he was cognizant of her arousal. It might\u2019ve made her feel at a disadvantage, except that he made no move to shield his own response.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said, taking a last little nip, \u201cor we\u2019ll never get to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said as he tugged her out and pulled the door shut, \u201cI don\u2019t have my purse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t need it.\u201d He began to lead her down the corridor, fingers intertwined with her own.</p><p>\u201cShould we be going out when things are at such a critical point?\u201d The military strategist in her was disturbed enough to fight her desire to have him all to herself. \u201cIf the Scotts manage to harm you\u2014\u201d</p><p>A finger pressed to her lips. \u201cWe\u2019re not going far.\u201d</p><p>Given his words, she wasn\u2019t surprised when he led her to his quarters, but she lost every bit of air in her body when she saw the table set with an immaculate white tablecloth, gleaming silverware, and long-stemmed candles, which Hawke lit before pulling out a chair. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>It was impossible to do anything but obey, particularly when he rewarded her with a kiss that had her breasts rising and falling in shuddering invitation. Pressing another hot, wet caress to the curve of her shoulder, he moved to take a seat, not on the other side of the table, but to her right. She knew why when he uncovered the first dish\u2014a crisp green salad with curling red and orange tendrils of the bell peppers she loved so much\u2014and lifted a fork.</p><p>Chapter 44</p> <p>HAWKE LOVED HAVING her here, in his territory, all glowing skin and dark hair glimmering with hidden notes of fire. The wolf rolled in her scent, playful as a pup\u2014but Hawke was vividly conscious of the spice-scented arousal that had grown ever hotter as the minutes passed. She hadn\u2019t rebelled against his feeding her, had in fact, insisted on returning the favor. But the desert bowl had only one spoon, and he had it.</p><p>On second thought . . .</p><p>Throwing the spoon over his shoulder, he dipped his finger in the rich butterscotch ice cream, brought it to her lips. Her mouth formed a soft, hot vice around his finger as she sucked\u2014then she brought her tongue into play.</p><p>Every part of him wanted to lunge at her, but he resisted the primitive urge. This night, it was about her. She\u2019d given herself to him, and he wanted her to know that he understood the value of her gift, that he would never allow her to feel anything but cherished.</p><p>Removing his finger through lips that teased him with their luscious grip, he swirled it back in the ice cream and painted the curve of her mouth with the sweet treat before dipping his head and kissing it off. Her lips were cool from the icy treat, but they warmed up fast, her taste a lick of butterscotch and spice.</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d she said, hands clenching on the lapels of his shirt, the top curves of her breasts flushed and plump, \u201cI\u2019ve had enough dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u201d\u2014he nipped at her lips because he loved the way her arousal spiked each time he did it, flicked his tongue over the small hurt\u2014\u201cI guess it\u2019s time for mine.\u201d He felt the tremor that shook her frame as he drew her out of her seat, knew it wasn\u2019t fear. Sliding his hands down her ribs, he rested them on the temptation of her hips. Anticipation turned her eyes to midnight as he backed her out, kiss by slow kiss, from the living area and into his bedroom.</p><p>Onto his bed.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d he said, moving around to the end of the bed after placing her on the sheets, so he could circle his hands around her ankles, tug her forward a couple of inches. \u201cAll mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the way you say my name in bed.\u201d Lifting one slender foot, he pressed a kiss to her ankle, then undid the strap that held up her pretty sandal and dropped it to the floor. Her foot curled under his touch, a delicate kittenish arch. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m the one who\u2019s going to end up with a foot fetish,\u201d he murmured, lighting a kiss on her other ankle as he undid the second sandal.</p><p>A laugh that sounded startled out of her.</p><p>Pleased with himself, he took a playful bite of her little toe as he flicked aside her shoe and raised his head. \u201cLook at you, aroused and sexy and in my bed.\u201d</p><p>No blush, no hesitation. Those passion-dark eyes followed him as he shrugged off his jacket and threw it on the back of a chair, before beginning to unbutton his shirt. His wolf preened for her.</p><p>SIENNA clutched at the sheets, her body making small restless shifts as Hawke\u2019s black shirt parted to expose a strip of masculine chest she wanted to rub up against in the most scandalous of ways. When he tugged the shirt out of his pants and finished unbuttoning it, her throat dried up.</p><p>There was something deliciously decadent about a man\u2014about him\u2014in a partial state of undress. As if she\u2019d caught a glimpse of the forbidden.</p><p>Kicking off his shoes and socks without taking his eyes off her, he prowled over to the side of the bed. \u201cI like this dress,\u201d he said, and it was a vocal caress. \u201cLet\u2019s not tear it.\u201d Putting one knee on the bed, he leaned down to kiss her, pure heated demand. \u201cTurn over,\u201d he murmured after he\u2019d melted her bones.</p><p>It probably wasn\u2019t the best of ideas to give him everything he wanted, but she had no willpower where he was concerned. Could any woman resist him when he was like this? Sienna didn\u2019t think so\u2014of course, if any other woman did ever dare touch him, she\u2019d fry the bitch in under a second.</p><p>\u201cWhat just went through your head, hmm?\u201d</p><p>She told him the truth, saw the wolf laugh, bare its teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl.\u201d His hands flipped her onto her front. \u201cYou understand it\u2019s a two-way street?\u201d Fingers pushing aside her hair to bare her nape. \u201cNext time that baby cat puts his hands on you, he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKit is my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have a baby cat alpha as a friend.\u201d A bite on her nape.</p><p>Oh, God. It was near impossible to think, but she found the will to reach back and pull on his hair. \u201cLeave my friends alone or I\u2019ll be forced to get mean.\u201d</p><p>Licks over the bite, laughter against her ear. \u201cI like you,\u201d he said, and she had the deep, deep awareness that it was the wolf part of him that had spoken with such delight.</p><p>The tug came an instant later, the zipper being lowered. Then . . . a breath of hot air against her spine, open-mouthed kisses along the skin bared by the parting metallic teeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shivering, she arched for him, felt his fingers slip inside her dress to the curve of her waist. The roughness of his skin was a shock that made her moan. More kisses on her back before he removed his touch to tug down the straps. Instead of turning onto her back, she rose up a fraction and pulled the straps down off her arms, pushing the dress to her waist.</p><p>A big, warm hand on her ribs, curving up to cup her breast without warning. Crying out, she fell forward. It trapped his hand between her body and the bed\u2014not that he seemed to mind. Squeezing and petting her with possessive heat, he dropped a rain of kisses over her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she protested when he removed his hand.</p><p>\u201cI want this dress off.\u201d A couple of hard tugs and it was gone, leaving her dressed in nothing but the lace panties she\u2019d bought months ago but never before worn. They\u2019d felt too hedonistic, too sensual. That was before she\u2019d started playing with an alpha wolf.</p><p>Pushing long strands of hair off her face, she turned her head to see said wolf straddling her thighs. He was still clothed, that unbuttoned shirt pure provocation, but his eyes had gone night-glow, his face taut with wild hunger. It was instinct to curve her body up toward him, to seek to entice.</p><p>His gaze flicked up to meet hers, and then he moved, gripping her jaw so he could take her mouth in a full-bodied kiss that was all tongue and heat and teeth as he slid his free hand under her body to close over the sensitive flesh of one breast, the hard push of his erection insistent against skin naked under fine black lace. It was at that moment, with his beautiful, hungry mouth on hers, his big, gorgeous body pressing down against her own, and his fingers plucking at her nipple that she realized she was in way over her head.</p><p>HAWKE knew it the instant Sienna lost her confidence, the instant she started to retreat. Rubbing his thumb over her nipple, he fought his possessive urges and gentled the voracious kiss. She was his. There would be only pleasure for her tonight.</p><p>It was difficult to break away from her mouth, to resist the temptation to squeeze and mold her neglected breast. Instead, nudging her onto her back, he nuzzled at her neck before rising to shrug off his shirt. \u201cTouch me?\u201d</p><p>Her hands went to his chest at once, petting him the way she knew he liked. It made him want to spread her thighs, settle in between, until he could rub his cock against the damp softness of her. She\u2019d be so lush, so perfect. Instead, he allowed himself only a single lick to the tip of one tightly furled nipple\u2014to her quivering moan\u2014before beginning to kiss his way down her body.</p><p>Her fingers clenched in his hair.</p><p>Realizing she was attempting to keep him at her breasts, he smiled, retraced his steps. \u201cThis what you want, baby?\u201d</p><p>She arched up off the bed when he took her nipple into his mouth, rolling the taut nub over his tongue. Sensitive, very sensitive, he thought, closing one hand over her hip, the touch of lace under his palm a sensual pleasure . . . but nowhere near as erotic as her naked skin. Releasing that nipple without biting\u2014he\u2019d save that for next time\u2014he swirled his tongue around the other, wanting to drown her in pleasure, until she\u2019d never feel the lack of the one thing he couldn\u2019t give her.</p><p>\u201cDid you enjoy my mouth on your breasts?\u201d he asked after resuming his downward journey.</p><p>\u201cYou know I did.\u201d Husky words, her hands shaping and caressing his shoulders.</p><p>Wanting those hands on every inch of his body, he pressed a kiss to her navel. \u201cI like to hear.\u201d Her arousal was intoxicating this close to the liquid heat between her thighs, and he had to fist one hand in the sheets to rein himself back before he scared her. \u201cTell me if this pleases you.\u201d Skipping over the damp curls under the small triangle of black lace that teased rather than concealed, he kissed and nipped at her inner thighs.</p><p>A shuddering breath. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Spreading her legs, he used a single claw to cut the sides of her panties. A tug later and they were gone. Every one of her muscles locked at the same moment, and when he looked up, her eyes were closed tight. His mouth watered to taste the drugging scent so rich and luscious against his tongue, but he wanted her with him.</p><p>Rising, he pressed a kiss to her stomach, to her chest, to her throat, to her lips. She opened to him without hesitation, dangerous and wild and Sienna. Only when her hips were undulating up toward him did he run his hand back down to the heat between her legs, caressing her desire-swollen folds with a single finger, his touch delicate. \u201cYou like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A sigh, a roll of her hips as she searched for more.</p><p>He cupped her, stroking around the tight, wet entrance that had his cock jerking in the confines of his pants. She cried out into his mouth and gripped his biceps, but he drew away to kiss his way down her body once more. This time her eyes stayed open, and on him.</p><p>SIENNA had just barely enough presence of mind to check the cold fire. It was nowhere near critical after the most recent purge, and her reinforced shields were holding. That meant she could enjoy this night, enjoy being with Hawke.</p><p>Right now, she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d survive what he intended to do, but oh, how she wanted it. Her body felt like a toy that had been wound up too tight, every part of her straining to reach for something she couldn\u2019t quite touch. \u201cHawke, please.\u201d</p> <p>Wolf-blue eyes held her own. \u201cTrust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d There was no question of trust, never had been.</p><p>A wicked, wicked smile. \u201cI told you it was my turn for dessert.\u201d</p><p>With that sinful statement, he pulled her legs over his shoulders and gave her a kiss so intimate, her mind roiled with blackness before sparking in a fever of crimson. She\u2019d never known, never understood. When she\u2019d read about it in the women\u2019s magazines, it had seemed like an act that would embarrass her. Right now, she wasn\u2019t embarrassed. She was eager and needy and so pleasured it hurt.</p><p>If the first level of dissonance had been in effect, she would\u2019ve passed out from the pain, but though the sensations were beyond anything she\u2019d ever known, there was no agonizing backlash.</p><p>Her wolf had no inhibitions, refused to permit her any either. \u201cA little more,\u201d he said, spreading her thighs even farther to allow him better access to flesh swollen and flushed with passion. It made her hands clench on the sheets to imagine how he saw her. Slick and pink and open. Then he began to taste her in slow, wet strokes, one finger entering her in a prelude to the ultimate penetration, and her thoughts fractured into a long, shuddering submission.</p><p>She came to, to find a very satisfied wolf at her side. He was drawing patterns on the sweat-sheened skin of her navel with his finger. \u201cHow was dessert?\u201d she asked, her throat a husky reminder that she\u2019d screamed at the end.</p><p>A flash of teeth. \u201cI plan to go back for seconds in a bit.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath. \u201cBad wolf.\u201d</p><p>Sliding down his hand, he tugged at her damp curls. \u201cHungry wolf.\u201d</p><p>Right then, Sienna knew she was sunk. Absolutely and gloriously. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Wolf-pale eyes gleamed at her from below a thick fan of lashes. \u201cHow much?\u201d A tease and a dare in one.</p><p>Turning to push him onto his back, she kissed her way down his throat to bite at his pulse. His hand clenched in her hair, his muscles taut. He didn\u2019t stop her when she smoothed one hand down that beautiful chest and lower, to the top button of his pants. She had no idea when he\u2019d gotten rid of the belt but she was grateful\u2014her fine-motor functions were somewhat impaired after the way he\u2019d eaten up his dessert.</p><p>Now, she lifted her head, bracing herself with one hand on his shoulder as she looked down to watch her other try to undo the button. He hissed as her fingertips brushed the thrust of his erection, every one of his muscles going so rigid, she\u2019d have thought him in pain except that she\u2019d felt the kiss of raw sexual pleasure, understood.</p><p>Frustrated because her fingers kept sliding off the stubborn button, she ignored it and slid her hand under his waistband. To touch hot, hard flesh sheathed in delicate velvet. Her breath rushed out of her, but her hand was being pulled away before she was anywhere close to satisfied, and suddenly, she was flat on her back with a wolf at her mouth, at her throat, at her breasts. He sucked her nipples into his mouth, hard and wet, possessive hands plumping up her breasts for his enjoyment.</p><p>She was used to the teeth by now . . . but not the way they made her feel.</p><p>Jerking, she went to wrap her leg around his waist, was halted by his hand on her thigh. \u201cPants,\u201d he muttered and rose off the bed in a lightning fast move. A split second later, he was back, pulling her leg over his naked hip.</p><p>Sienna tried to push at him. She wanted to see, wanted to pet and caress that hard male body. But then he ran his tongue along the lower curve of her breast, and she lost her train of thought, her hands clenching on the muscled silk of his shoulders. \u201cKiss me.\u201d It was a needy whisper, and it was hardly out before he was there, one hand cupping her face while he braced himself above her with the other, his mouth teasing and playing with hers until she lost her breath, had to break the delicious contact.</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d the wolf asked.</p><p>She tried to suck in a breath. \u201cYou\u2019re naked.\u201d</p><p>A slow, slow smile. \u201cSo are you.\u201d He slid his hand down her thigh, shifting to stroke through the softest, most sensitive part of her. \u201cSo slick,\u201d he said, those eyes hot and hungry as he rubbed at the entrance to her body.</p><p>Her mind fogged over, her hips rising to meet his touch. When he pressed, she gripped his biceps and pulled him down, intent on tasting his mouth, his neck, any part of him she could reach as he breached her with a finger, adding a second with a slowness that made her shudder. He scissored them just as slow, stretching her tissues and rocking jolts of pleasure through her. Readying her, she thought through the haze, he was readying her body for his possession.</p><p>She could feel him against the inside of her thigh, knew the proud thickness of his erection would be nothing easy to accept. Lights flashed behind her eyelids as he used the head of his cock to tease her clitoris. Easy was not something that mattered. She just wanted him. Now. \u201cInside me.\u201d Hurry. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Hawke heard her, but he continued to pump his fingers into her, continued to kiss her\u2014sucking at her lower lip, dipping his head to mark her breasts, her neck. \u201cNot yet.\u201d He wanted her all but liquid with pleasure before he took her, because it was going to hurt. No way around it, even if the thought of hurting her in any way pissed him off. She was tight and hot, and he was a big man.</p><p>\u201cLet me pet you some more.\u201d Sweat shimmered on her throat, and he licked it off, savoring the salt and spice of her. \u201cI love your breasts.\u201d They were flushed pink from the brush of his jaw, the touch of his teeth. In a chair, he thought, biting at her lower lip when she ordered him to \u201cFinish it!\u201d He was going to take her in a chair the next time so she\u2019d be astride him and he could play with those pretty breasts as he pleased.</p><p>Feeling her muscles clench around his fingers, he kissed his way back down her body again and spread her thighs, inhaling the erotic musk of her. His mouth watered, and since she was his and she was delicious, he decided it was time for seconds. It only took one long lick for her to shatter, but he kept going, using his mouth to pleasure her with flicks and nips and hot little sucks focused on the slippery nubbin of flesh at the apex of her thighs until her body went limp, aftershocks rippling over her skin.</p> <p>When he prowled up this time, she watched him from beneath heavy-lidded eyes, her chest rising and falling in a rhythm that was pure temptation. \u201cAre you,\u201d she gasped as he slotted himself against her, began to push, \u201clike this\u201d\u2014a throaty feminine sound, her tissues liquid fire around him\u2014\u201call the time?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t thinking much anymore, consumed by pleasure, but he knew one thing. \u201cFor you\u2014yes.\u201d Gripping her hip, he slid in another couple of inches, felt her nails dig into his shoulders.</p><p>But instead of pushing him away, she pulled him toward her. The leash snapped, and he buried himself to the hilt in a single thrust. Her pained gasp was muffled against his shoulder as her legs quivered around him. Yet she continued to hold him tight. Finding some semblance of civilized thought, he petted her thigh, nuzzled, and kissed until she began to move her hips\u2014or attempt to in any case. He pinned her to the bed, and he had every intention of using that leverage for her pleasure.</p><p>One hand on her hip, he slid back out torturously slowly . . . then slid in the same way. Sienna\u2019s eyes flared open, held his. \u201cDo that again.\u201d An intimate demand.</p><p>Teeth bared in a feral smile, he did. Then again. And again. Until she fractured around him, those tiny muscles squeezing so tight around his cock he almost came. He wanted to pound into her, to flip her onto her hands and knees, and to mount her in the most primitive of ways, but that could wait. Tonight, this, it was for her. So though his jaw hurt from how hard he\u2019d clenched it, he continued to stroke into her slow and easy and again. And had the pleasure of feeling her body rise to meet his over and over.</p> <p>This time, he allowed the erotic pulse of her orgasm to sweep him under, wring him dry. \u201cNext time,\u201d he murmured in her ear as he collapsed, his heart a fucking drum against his ribs, \u201cI\u2019m not going to behave.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 45</p><p>TEN HOURS LATER, those rasped-out words had Sienna wondering just how very bad he could be, because if he\u2019d been good last night . . . Dear God. Her body still bore the marks of his passion. The insides of her thighs were stubble-burned, and there was more than one bite mark on her breasts. Remembering how he\u2019d taken her with such primal thoroughness made her skin flush, things clench low in her body. She wanted his teeth\u2014</p><p>Thwack!</p><p>\u201cOuch!\u201d She slammed up the long wooden staff too late to block Indigo\u2019s strike. \u201cThat hurt.\u201d</p><p>The lieutenant rolled her eyes. \u201cHere I was trying for a love tap. Stop mooning about his wolfiness and start giving me some real competition.\u201d</p> <p>Swiveling the stick, Sienna went for Indigo\u2019s legs. The lieutenant avoided the sweep, but the move put her slightly off balance. Then they were off. Indigo was too experienced for Sienna to take down, but she got in a few good licks, and by the time the practice session ended, her blood was pumping, her black athletic tank stuck to her skin.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I needed that,\u201d Indigo said, gulping down water. \u201cWhat are you scheduled for now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a free afternoon.\u201d Sienna opened her own bottle, took a long draught. \u201cThought I\u2019d spend time with Toby and Marlee, do some work on a course paper at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Indigo\u2019s eyes gleamed as she put down the water and reached back to redo her long black hair into a tight ponytail. \u201cYou know anything of what\u2019s happening between Walker and Lara?\u201d</p><p>Sienna began to buff her fighting staff with a towel. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Indigo laughed at her fake innocent act. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting away with it, you know. Everyone\u2019s just being real polite and pretending not to notice they\u2019re kissing each other in dark corners.\u201d</p><p>Sienna\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cMy uncle would never be so common as to kiss a woman in a dark corner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, must be someone tall, blond, and silent who looks exactly like him.\u201d</p> <p>Sienna was still laughing at that dry statement when she went to join the children after a quick shower to wash off the sweat. However, she hadn\u2019t been at the family apartment long before she got a call from Riley.</p><p>\u201cSienna, I know you\u2019re meant to have the afternoon off, but can you accompany Mariska and three of her techs up to check on the hydro station?\u201d he said, referring to the \u201cgreen\u201d system that used the natural power of the water crashing over the mountains to supply the den\u2019s power. \u201cThe plant is secure, and I\u2019ve got Drew heading up with the team, but he should have backup, just in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but I\u2019m with Marlee and Toby. Can you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even a question, sweetheart. Bring them over\u2014they can hang out in the senior soldiers\u2019 break room off my office.\u201d</p><p>Knowing the kids loved spending time in the hub, which saw a constant rotation of the pack\u2019s dominants\u2014with more than one willing to pull up a chair to chat to a couple of \u201cpups\u201d\u2014she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be there in fifteen.\u201d It actually took closer to twenty to get everything sorted, but she left her brother and cousin competing with each other to tell Riley their latest news.</p><p>Drew was waiting for the team at the exit\u2014or more accurately, he was kissing Indigo and smiling all the while. They\u2019d been laughing before they kissed, Sienna thought, remembering Hawke teasing her as they lay in bed. She\u2019d felt it when he smiled as he kissed her. It had been more wonderful than she could\u2019ve imagined. \u201cAhem,\u201d she said, lips curving at the memory. \u201cAt least find a dark corner.\u201d</p><p>Indigo shot her a laughing look. \u201cTouch\u00e9.\u201d Another kiss before she headed down the corridor, a woman with long, long legs and a body that moved with lithe muscular grace. \u201cDon\u2019t get shot,\u201d were her parting words to her mate.</p><p>\u201cToo scared of you to dare!\u201d Drew called out, then grabbed some of the techs\u2019 gear. \u201cLet\u2019s go, boys and girls.\u201d</p><p>HAVING spent the day with Matthias\u2019s and Alexei\u2019s teams to make sure they were comfortable with the terrain and aware what their duties would be in a combat situation, Hawke was more than ready to take some time for himself. Thanks to his people, he could.</p><p>Waylaying Sienna as she headed to her quarters after returning from the hydro station, he tugged her down to the garage. It was tempting to lick up the taste of her, but if he put his mouth on those lush lips, they wouldn\u2019t make it any farther than his bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you taking me?\u201d she asked once they were on the road, the light diffuse as the first whisper of night touched the Sierra. \u201cAm I being Psynapped?\u201d</p><p>His wolf laughed. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play.\u201d</p><p>It should\u2019ve sounded silly, Sienna thought, when there were so many other things to worry about, but there was no denying that the constant state of battle-readiness was an unrelenting tension at the back of her mind. Last night had been a sensual respite, one that had left her more alert and aware today. \u201cPlay isn\u2019t a waste of time, is it?\u201d she said out loud, having never quite understood that until this moment.</p><p>\u201cThe wolf has decided that that question doesn\u2019t deserve an answer.\u201d</p><p>It made her laugh. \u201cWhat\u2019s the game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait and see.\u201d</p><p>Half an hour later, he brought the vehicle to a stop deep in den territory, the area so dense with trees that he\u2019d had to punch up the hover drive and get creative in his driving. As he set it down, she peered out at the small cabin hidden amongst the firs. \u201cIt looks new.\u201d So new the area was still littered with wood chips.</p><p>\u201cThe lieutenants in the den banded together with the senior soldiers and started to throw it up.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cApparently the other soldiers got wind of it and wanted in. It took them twelve straight hours with a revolving crew and by the end . . . seems almost every able-bodied adult in the den had something to do with either building the cabin or making sure it was furnished.\u201d</p><p>She heard the stunned joy in his voice, felt her heart clench. \u201cThey love you.\u201d Just like me.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Shaking his head, he got out and jogged around to open her door. \u201cI\u2019d have torn into them for spending time on this when we\u2019re so close to war, but Drew tells me the project boosted morale back to normal levels, so . . .\u201d He pulled her from her seat. \u201cThis is ours,\u201d he said, leaning down to rub his nose against hers. \u201cThe area\u2019s off-limits to the pack when either of us is in the vicinity.\u201d</p><p>Sienna stood on tiptoe, her hands on his shoulders. \u201cJust us?\u201d</p><p>The bright slash of his smile echoed her own. \u201cJust us.\u201d</p><p>It was an incredible gift. She loved SnowDancer with every beat of her heart, would die to protect the people who\u2019d become her own, but being able to be truly alone with Hawke for even a few hours, a few minutes\u2014she had no words for the force of her joy. \u201cLet\u2019s go explore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laughing, he followed at her heels as she ran up the two small steps and crossed the porch to push open the door, flick the manual light switch. \u201cOh, it\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she said as the cabin was bathed in a soft glow. The entire place was a single large room, except for an alcove at the back fitted with a wooden sliding door.</p><p>There was a kitchenette off to the left, with a table and two chairs tucked in neatly under the window. To the right was a fireplace set with an eco-friendly laz-fire, in front of which lay a fluffy white rug Sienna could already feel plush and decadent against her skin. The rest of the available space was dominated by a huge bed with a wrought-iron headboard. Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cHawke,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy are there fur-lined handcuffs hanging from the headboard?\u201d Stepping closer, she saw\u2014\u201cThey\u2019re too big for my wrists.\u201d Oh.</p> <p>Hawke made a growling sound low in his throat. \u201cProbably Drew\u2019s idea of a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Sienna murmured. \u201cDrew told me to never, ever talk to him about sex. As far as he\u2019s concerned, I\u2019ll be a virgin until I\u2019m a hundred, same as Brenna.\u201d</p><p>Unhooking the cuffs, Hawke brought them to his nose. Sniffed. \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d His grin was half-amused, half-feral.</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigure it out. Who do you think is sitting at home laughing his ass off at the dance you\u2019ve led me?\u201d</p> <p>Sienna paused, considered all the people who cared about Hawke and who\u2019d dare pull a prank like this. \u201cLucas,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn cat must\u2019ve snuck in here after the crew left.\u201d He fiddled with one cuff, smiled as it made a snick of sound. \u201cWhat do you know\u2014they tighten up fine for smaller wrists.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t trust that look. \u201cHawke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d A command, for all that his voice was soft, his eyes hooded.</p><p>She swallowed, took a step back. \u201cUm . . . perhaps . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared, Sienna?\u201d Thick, silver-gold lashes lifted to reveal those impossible eyes, the eyes of a husky or a bird of prey.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d It wasn\u2019t fear that caused her heart to beat a staccato drumbeat against her ribs, her blood to turn molten.</p><p>Hawke smiled . . . and she realized he was stalking her in slow, steady steps. Twisting, she saw she was about to back herself into a corner. She jerked left, expecting him to stop her. When he didn\u2019t, suspicion licked through her veins. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re going to be reasonable about this,\u201d she said, never moving her eyes off him.</p><p>\u201cI like your hair.\u201d That wild gaze stroked over her. \u201cPut it down for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019d be a good idea.\u201d It was instinct to disobey him, to challenge him.</p><p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d</p><p>Her hair tumbled around her shoulders before she so much as sensed him shift position. He was crouched on the bed, on the other side of the room by the time she realized what he\u2019d done. A very satisfied, very male smile flirted with his lips.</p><p>Playing with her, she thought, he was playing with her.</p><p>And tonight, there was no leash on the wolf.</p> <p>\u201cYou think you\u2019re so smart,\u201d she said, inching to her left again as he reached back to pull off his T-shirt with masculine roughness. The door was only a few steps away.</p><p>T-shirt on the floor, he angled his head in a way that sent his hair sliding over one side of his face. \u201cI think you should take off your top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it and I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d She shot up a column of cold fire between them, making him come to a skidding halt, his nose a bare millimeter from the flame.</p><p>He bared his teeth. She grinned . . . and took off, slamming the door shut behind herself as she dropped the wall of flickering red and gold. Something crashed hard on the wood as her feet hit the earth and her instinct was to turn around, check he was okay. But that wasn\u2019t the game. And she was nowhere near wolf-fast. He was breathing down her neck in seconds.</p><p>But she was an X. A cardinal.</p><p>She blocked his way using her abilities until he fell back. Chest heaving, she came to a halt, bracing herself with her hands on her thighs as adrenaline thumped through her. God, but he was fast. Never had she seen anything or anyone move with that kind of speed. Dangerous man. Her man.</p><p>Having caught her breath, she rose to her full height. But even with her every sense on alert, she didn\u2019t have the slightest inkling he\u2019d circled around on her blind side until she turned to find herself staring into eyes gone night-glow. \u201cPretty, pretty, Sienna.\u201d</p><p>Gripping her wrists before she could summon the cold fire, he tugged her close, shattering her concentration; his chest was a gorgeous, touchable distraction. There wasn\u2019t even a hint of sweat on him. It should have been annoying, but she was far too fascinated by the smile flirting with his lips to care. \u201cMy Sienna.\u201d</p><p>The absolute possession in his voice didn\u2019t scare her. \u201cYours.\u201d</p><p>A short, sharp nip at her neck. She shivered with pleasure, before twisting away from him using a move Indigo had drilled into her until it was second nature. She wondered if the wolf lieutenant had known this day would come. Hawke smiled at her, a delighted predator. Then he lunged.</p><p>She scrambled backward, only to feel him brush past her and into the forest.</p><p>The game was on again.</p><p>Taking off in the opposite direction, her night vision ample in the early evening light, she began to laugh inside. This was fun. It was only a couple of minutes later that she felt him pacing her in the trees to her left. Heart pumping hard and fast, she raised a wall of X-fire and disappeared in another direction, muddying her scent by using every trick in the book. It wouldn\u2019t work of course. He was an alpha, his senses acute, and\u2014</p><p>A bouquet of wildflowers in her path.</p><p>Laughter bubbling out of her, she picked them up, put a cherry red bloom behind her ear. Taking the rest in hand, she looked up. And realized he\u2019d herded her back to the cabin.</p><p>To the bed.</p><p>Butterflies in her stomach. Because she understood his words from last night now, knew that he\u2019d been on his very, very best behavior. Tonight . . . tonight she\u2019d be tangling with the dominant, wild heart of him.</p><p>Creeping up to the cabin, she tried to locate him in the dark shadow of the trees.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Taking a long, deep breath, she made a run for it. Her feet left the ground midway through the journey, and she barely had time to utter a short scream before he dumped her on the bed, the wildflowers scattering around them as he braced himself above her, all playful smile and wolf eyes. \u201cI win.\u201d A sharp nip to her lower lip. \u201cWhat\u2019s my prize?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 46</p><p>OH DEAR GOD. She was melting into a pile of goo. He was big and beautiful and impossible . . . and hers. He was hers. Not as she\u2019d once imagined he would be, but this bond that continued to grow between them? It was as strong, as precious. \u201cI\u2019ll brush your hair for you.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, thought about it. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Delighted, she waited for him to get off so she could rise. He stayed in place, his gaze never moving off her lips. She parted them, felt his breathing change. \u201cHawke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you the brush.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t even managed to catch her breath before he was back over her again. \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>Taking the brush, she reached up to push one hand through the thick silk of his hair. It was cool, soft, stunning. A wolf\u2019s pelt given human form. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore.\u201d He dipped his head, allowing her to run the bristles through the strands. A low growling sound of pleasure accompanied her first stroke, and he lowered his body a fraction, so she could feel his weight against her legs. \u201cHarder.\u201d</p><p>Obeying, she ran the brush through his hair over and over. \u201cYou\u2019re closer to your wolf than any other changeling I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d It told her so much.</p><p>\u201cI am as I am.\u201d A wolf\u2019s answer. It had no time for overthinking things. \u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She dropped the brush. \u201cWh\u2014\u201d His mouth took hers.</p><p>The kiss was hot and deep and all kinds of sinful, his hand closing gently around her throat to hold her in place as his tongue played with hers and his thigh rubbed against the arousal between her legs. When he let her breathe, it was only for the barest instant before he was taking her again. Her hands clenched on his shoulders, muscle and tendon flexing so powerful and hot under her touch.</p><p>\u201cSienna,\u201d he murmured against her lips. \u201cSmart.\u201d Another bite to her lower lip, this one softer. \u201cStrong.\u201d His body settled heavily on her own, his erection a demanding hardness between her thighs. \u201cMine.\u201d</p><p>When she used her nails on his back, he growled and dipped his head to suck on the pulse in her neck, making her body arch. Or attempt to. He was too heavy to shift. Fisting one hand in his hair, she breathed in the scent of him and knew that tonight he\u2019d demand more than surrender, more than submission. He\u2019d demand everything she was, then ask for more.</p><p>\u201cYour heart\u2019s fluttering like a bird\u2019s.\u201d A lick over her pulse.</p><p>It took concentration to find the words, to put together a coherent sentence. \u201cThis is only my second time, you know.\u201d Then she used her mouth on the strong cords of his neck.</p><p>He liked that, his chest rumbling against her. \u201cI\u2019ll make it good for you. You know I will.\u201d Arrogant and sexy and tender, he braced himself on one arm, running the fingers of the other down her front, over the buttons of her shirt. \u201cI don\u2019t like this.\u201d</p><p>The shirt tore down the middle.</p><p>As she sucked in a startled breath, he pressed an openmouthed kiss to the bared flesh of her abdomen, his hand stroking under and around the torn shirt to spread over her lower back.</p><p>\u201cHawke.\u201d</p><p>Sliding his hand around to the front again, he moved it in slow circles over her navel. \u201cHmm?\u201d Another kiss, this one on her breastbone. \u201cDoes something hurt, baby?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>A wolf-sharp smile before he gave her exactly what she wanted. A kiss that tore her wide open with its sensual tenderness and reformed her anew. She nipped at his mouth this time, and he paused, gave her a look out of eyes slitted until she could only see a strip of wolf-blue. \u201cYou bit me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI say it\u2019s fair play.\u201d She tapped her own lower lip. \u201cYou\u2019ve done it more than once.\u201d</p><p>He growled low in his throat, splaying his hand over her ribs. \u201cBite me again.\u201d</p><p>Undone, she did. Then, deciding to play as wild as her lover, she dug her fingernails into his shoulders and gripped the taut tendon of his neck between her teeth. He froze above her, his entire body tense with expectation.</p> <p>She bit down hard enough to leave a mark before releasing him.</p><p>He snarled at her\u2014but she wasn\u2019t fooled. She\u2019d seen the wolf laughing in his eyes. \u201cI marked you,\u201d she said, smug.</p><p>His hand closed around her throat. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m mad at being marked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>His answer was to move his hand, place it over her breast, her bra no protection against the primal heat of him. \u201cI know where I\u2019m going to mark you. Again.\u201d</p> <p>Feeling her flesh swell under his touch, she said, \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t like being marked up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTough.\u201d A blur of movement and her bra was in so many shreds around the bed.</p><p>Sienna rose toward him in wicked invitation. He made a deep rumbling sound in his throat that peaked her nipples to tight points, and then his lips were on her soft flesh, marking, branding, tasting, and sucking. Thought scattered, sensation crashed. Thrusting her hands into his hair, she held on for the ride of her life.</p><p>HAWKE tried to pull himself back, knowing Sienna wasn\u2019t equipped to handle everything even after last night. He couldn\u2019t do it. He\u2019d waited too long for her\u2014wolf and man wanted her with feral ferocity. \u201cIf you need to stop me,\u201d he forced himself to say, lifting his head to meet her gaze, \u201cdo what you need to do.\u201d</p><p>Cardinal eyes gone black with desire locked with his own. \u201cAre you planning to hurt me?\u201d</p><p>He growled. That was a question that didn\u2019t need an answer.</p> <p>\u201cThen why,\u201d she murmured, \u201cwould I want to stop you?\u201d Her hands tugging at his hair, pulling him up so she could seduce his mouth with a hot, drugging kiss. \u201cGive me everything.\u201d A whisper. A command.</p><p>He didn\u2019t take orders from anyone . . . but for her, he\u2019d make an exception. Closing his hand over the erotic invitation of her breast once more, he squeezed, catching her responding cry with his mouth. Under his palm, her nipple was hard, pebbled, pure temptation.</p><p>Breaking the kiss, he made his way back down her throat, nipping at her pulse because he liked the way that made her body flush with heat, the sensual musk of her deep and earthy. It drugged his wolf, intoxicated the man. Flicking out his tongue to tease the taut bud of her nipple, he smiled as her abdomen quivered under his palm.</p><p>He bit her next.</p><p>She jumped but didn\u2019t seem to mind his teeth there. But it was when he began to suck with hard, long pulls while plucking at her neglected nipple that she moaned, her hands clenching in his hair. Filing away that piece of knowledge for future reference, he scraped his teeth over her nipple.</p><p>Her entire body jerked.</p><p>Switching hand and mouth, he rubbed his thumb over the nipple he\u2019d left wet and throbbing, then settled down to give the other one the same treatment. A rumbling sound of sexual pleasure rolled up from his chest as her ankles locked at his back, merging with her throaty little cries.</p><p>When he lifted his head, her breath was jagged, her skin bearing the marks of his loving. But she was very much with him, his smart, sexy Psy. Raising her fingers, she played them over his lips, laughing when he tried to nip at them. Then she growled at him. Delighted, his wolf leaned down to press kisses along her jaw, down the line of her throat.</p> <p>Her scent was so decadent, so rich. Autumn and spice and steel. He rolled it around himself, happy because as of last night, that scent was intertwined with his own, not to be erased as long as they remained lovers\u2014which would be forever. No negotiation. No \u201cout\u201d clause. \u201cDo that again,\u201d he murmured, grazing his teeth along the outer curve of one of her breasts.</p><p>A shiver across her flesh. \u201cI need.\u201d</p><p>Nuzzling his way down to her abdomen, he pressed a kiss on her navel, his tongue tasting the perspiration-damp heat of her skin. \u201cLet me satisfy you.\u201d He forced himself to go slow, to not rip off the rest of her clothing. Instead, he gave her time to fight, to get away if she needed to as he broke her hold on him to slip off her shoes, then moved to undo her jeans and pull them down her legs, along with her panties.</p><p>But she stayed in place, her pretty legs sleek against the skin of his jaw as he threw the clothing off the side of the bed and rubbed his face against her.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d A short, shimmering sound, her hands fisting in the tumbled sheets.</p><p>Intrigued, he rubbed his jaw against the soft skin of her inner thighs once more. Her legs clenched around him, her scent a wild perfume. Wanting to lick it up, he rose onto his knees, spreading her thighs in front of him as he did so. His stubble had marked her soft skin, and he wasn\u2019t the least bit sorry.</p><p>Stroking his hands down her calves, he felt her socks. Chuckled. \u201cI think we\u2019ll leave these on.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed one socked foot on his thigh. \u201cShouldn\u2019t sex be more serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, which pack have you been living with the past few years?\u201d Leaning down, he kissed the side of her knee before shifting down to lie between her legs.</p><p>\u201cHawke?\u201d</p><p>He stroked her legs up over his shoulders. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d</p><p>THE husky question, asked in a tone that said he\u2019d give her everything, anything, melted Sienna from the inside out. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf looked up, his eyes reflecting silver in the lights that stroked them both in soft gold. \u201cI like hearing you say that. Tell me again after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d Sliding his hands under her buttocks, he lifted her to his mouth and then he\u2014</p><p>The scream was torn out of her. It didn\u2019t stop him, and oh, she was grateful. As he sucked and bit and tasted, she realized he\u2019d been holding back last night in more ways than one. If that had been the dessert, this was the full-course meal.</p><p>When he stroked his tongue through her quivering flesh, she lifted herself up to his mouth for more. \u201cShameless,\u201d he teased, letting her feel the edge of his teeth. \u201cJust the way I like you.\u201d She got more. A lot more.</p><p>Her brain hazed over. Legs crossing at his back as he ate her up like she was the most exotic delicacy prepared for him alone, Sienna surrendered to the rolling waves of pleasure, the breakers crashing over her in a wash of ecstasy so hot and sweet, it made flames lick up along her skin, a splinter of dissonance spear down her spine.</p><p>The pain was negligible\u2014and it shouldn\u2019t have been.</p><p>That worried her, but only for a second, because Hawke raised his head with a final, lingering lick, and moved one hand up to play with the flickering red and yellow of the cold fire. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t burn.\u201d</p><p>It took massive effort to find enough brain cells to put together an explanation. All she got out was, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Rubbing his jaw against her navel, Hawke moved to press kisses along the insides of her thighs. \u201cNo more,\u201d she found the will to say. \u201cCan\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>A chuckle that held total male satisfaction. \u201cWhat if I want to play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill you,\u201d she threatened.</p><p>Laughing in a way that told her the primal heart of him was very much in charge, he shifted up her body even as he slid his hand down to cup her with breathtaking intimacy, using one finger to stroke the excruciatingly sensitive entrance to her body. She arched into the touch, and when he bent to take her mouth, she took his in turn. His body was warm muscle and heavy weight on top of her. And his chest . . .</p><p>She rubbed against the fine, soft hairs that covered the ridged plane, her nipples tingling with sensation. When he pushed a finger inside of her, she bit down on his shoulder. He growled, holding her head against him as he stroked that finger in and out in a maddening rhythm.</p><p>Insane, she thought, he was going to drive her insane. Releasing her grip on his shoulder, she grabbed his head between her palms. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>The wolf looked out at her. \u201cIn a minute.\u201d He inserted a second finger, parted them inside, caressing her in the most intimate fashion.</p><p>\u201cHawke.\u201d She could feel an orgasm approaching again, knew she wasn\u2019t going be able to fight it.</p><p>Of course he didn\u2019t back off. He petted her even more outrageously. She fell hard\u2014and came to rest in his arms, her entire body so limp with pleasure that the idea of moving was not even to be considered. But when he kissed her, she found she had just enough energy to return the long, lazy tangling.</p><p>A stroke inside her, and her tissues quivered at the realization that his fingers were still lodged within. \u201cSorry,\u201d she murmured, \u201cgoing to sleep now.\u201d</p><p>A sexy, sexy laugh. Raining a line of hot, wet kisses down her throat as he withdrew his fingers, he spread her legs. It came to her that he was wearing his jeans, that she had on the remains of her shirt. \u201cClothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d A momentary coldness and then he was back, hot and hard and very, very aroused.</p><p>She sucked in a breath as he pushed in with the blunt head of his cock, her fingernails digging into the skin of his shoulders. It still wasn\u2019t comfortable, but oh, the rough friction felt good. Pushing one hand into his hair, she undulated her pelvis toward him, welcoming his possession. He shuddered, taking a hard grip on her hip. And then he thrust.</p><p>She jerked, tried to process the sensations, realized there was no managing this.</p><p>His hand clenching and unclenching on her hip, the bare kiss of claws. It made her shiver, meet his gaze. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, seeing the unasked question in his eyes, this wolf who\u2019d given her pleasure upon pleasure.</p><p>It was like snapping the leash.</p><p>Untamed and infinitely hungry, he moved over her, in her, with a hot power that had her crying out, her body going tight around the velvet steel of him. Clawing at his back, she felt his muscles bunch under her touch, his body a creation of raw beauty and wild strength. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Reaching behind himself, he pulled one of her legs off his waist, bent it to the knee, and pushed it wide, spreading her for his possession. His next thrust went so deep it reverberated through her very being. The last thing she remembered was feeling the kiss of claws along the side of her knee as he growled and sank into her in a rush of scalding heat.</p><p>Chapter 47</p><p>HEART PUMPING LIKE a rapid piston, Hawke raised his head after the orgasm that had almost ripped him in two to look down at the woman who continued to hold him inside. Possessive thing. Nuzzling at her as she tried to open heavy-lidded eyes, he stroked his hand down her thigh and said, \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>Her response turned the air blue.</p><p>Smiling against her skin, he took a lazy bite out of her breast, licking over the mark that was already fading. He\u2019d just had the best orgasm of his life, and he felt like he had more energy than he knew what to do with. As for his body, it was more than ready. Remaining seated in her snug channel, he stroked and petted as he checked to make sure he hadn\u2019t inadvertently hurt her with his claws.</p><p>There were no cuts, no injuries. The wolf relaxed, content to play now. When she bit him on the arm\u2014hard\u2014the instant he flicked a finger over her clit, he lifted his head. \u201cStill sensitive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, so don\u2019t even think about it.\u201d Hazy, desire drugged words.</p><p>Moving his hand, he smoothed it down her leg instead, teasing his fingers over the soft skin at the back of her knee. \u201cHmm.\u201d It was a pleasure all its own to pull out of her tight sheath, especially when her lips parted in a wordless murmur of reluctance.</p><p>Pleased with every single thing about her, he flipped her onto her stomach before she could object and slid right back in to the hilt. Her moan was deep, her hands fisting on the sheets. He knew she\u2019d liked it\u2014he could feel her pleasure in every delicate tremor of her internal muscles. \u201cAt my mercy,\u201d he said, bracing himself on one arm as he ran the other along the curve of her spine.</p><p>Her hair, that silky ruby red fire, tangled with his hand, made him think of the darker curls between her legs. Body humming with remembered pleasure, he flexed his cock inside of her, felt her roll up toward him. It caused his entire body to throb. So he did it again. She responded.</p><p>It was a long, lazy loving this time, filled with hot scents and the quiet murmur of lovers lost in each other.</p><p>LARA straightened her hair in the mirror for the thousandth time and checked in with Lucy via the comm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d the young nurse told her. \u201cI\u2019ve got everything covered. And I know you\u2019re only next door if we have an emergency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSing-Liu\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs fast asleep, her mate curled up around her. Take advantage of this time\u2014you won\u2019t have any free time soon if things go the way everyone thinks they will.\u201d</p><p>Knowing the nurse was right, she nodded and signed off. Then she slid her hands down the front of her simple black wrap-around dress, tucking her curls behind her ears, knowing they\u2019d pop right back out, and called her best friend, Ava. \u201cHow do I look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGorgeous, hot, and delicious.\u201d</p><p>Lara\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Ava\u2019s eyes turned solemn. \u201cHe came to you, Lara, so the man\u2019s earned brownie points in my book, but it doesn\u2019t alter who he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure,\u201d Lara murmured. \u201cI see beyond the shield now, Ava, and the man I see? He\u2019s capable of giving me everything I need and more.\u201d She had to hope, to believe that she could get Walker to see that, too.</p><p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d her best friend said with a wide smile, \u201clock the door and kiss his brains out.\u201d</p><p>Lara pressed her hands to her stomach at the idea of it. \u201cI better go. He\u2019ll be on time.\u201d</p> <p>He was.</p><p>She drank in the sight of him as she opened the door. \u201cHi.\u201d Dressed in jeans and a crisp white shirt with the sleeves folded back to the elbows, he looked calm and contained and distant. She wanted to muss him up so badly she had to curl her fingers into her palms to restrain the urge.</p><p>Entering when she stepped back, he closed the door behind himself. His eyes lingered on her face, on her curls, before sweeping down the front of her dress, back up. \u201cWhy are we watching a movie, Lara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014it\u2019s what people do on a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to do that?\u201d</p><p>Unable to read anything on that calm face, in those steady eyes, she said, \u201cWe\u2019re alone. We can do whatever we want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019d like to kiss you.\u201d Reaching out, he curved his hand around the side of her neck.</p><p>\u201cOh, well . . .\u201d Her lips parted of their own accord, and when he dipped his head, she could do nothing but stand on tiptoe, her hands tight on his shoulders.</p><p>He raised his head far too soon. \u201cThe sofa will work better,\u201d he murmured and lifting her into his arms, carried her to the seat.</p><p>She found herself sitting on his lap moments later, one arm around his neck, the bottom part of her dress having split to reveal a dangerous length of thigh. It might\u2019ve embarrassed her, except that Walker\u2019s eyes were trained on that bared flesh, and all she could think was that she\u2019d die if he didn\u2019t put one of those big, capable hands on her.</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d he said, tugging the two parts of the dress farther apart, \u201cdon\u2019t know much about intimacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d It came out husky. \u201cYou\u2019re doing just fine.\u201d So fine her heart was going to beat out of her chest at any minute.</p><p>\u201cDo I have permission to touch you, Lara?\u201d</p><p>Of course he\u2019d ask. He was Walker. He took nothing for granted. \u201cAny and all skin privileges you want,\u201d she whispered, wanting no mistakes on that score.</p><p>Light green eyes met hers for a blazing instant before he closed the callused roughness of his hand over her calf, ran it up to cup the back of her knee. \u201cSo soft.\u201d</p><p>Shivering, she reached down to tug at his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s sensitive.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t move. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The other kind of sensitive.\u201d The kind that had her nipples peaking against the soft fabric of her dress.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll touch you there again later.\u201d Sliding that hand up over her thigh, he flattened his other over her spine.</p><p>When he didn\u2019t make any other move, she looked up, met his gaze. \u201cWalker?\u201d He was a dominant, notwithstanding the fact that he didn\u2019t wear a wolf\u2019s skin. Men like that didn\u2019t hesitate once they had permission.</p><p>\u201cThis\u201d\u2014a squeeze of her thigh that had her stomach tensing\u2014\u201cisn\u2019t the only kind of intimacy, is it, Lara?\u201d</p><p>Always, he surprised her, this man. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered, stroking her fingers up over his nape and into his hair.</p><p>\u201cWill you tell me about your parents?\u201d</p><p>Her heart twisted into a thousand knots at the quiet, powerful request. This wasn\u2019t how she\u2019d imagined the night would go. It was a thousand times better. \u201cYou know my father is Mack, the senior tech in charge of the hydro plant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your mother is Aisha,\u201d he said at once, \u201cone of the chief cooks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. They\u2019re wonderful.\u201d Smart and loving and devoted, both to each other and Lara. \u201cThough my mother despairs of my cooking skills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Aisha\u2019s the one who makes up the plates I bring you.\u201d A spark of unexpected humor in that stunning green. \u201cWe get along very well\u2014possibly because we\u2019re in agreement on the fact that bullying you into taking care of yourself is not only acceptable, but necessary.\u201d</p><p>It startled a laugh out of her to think of her vibrant, chatterbox of a mother and thoughtful, intense Walker as conspirators. \u201cI wondered how you knew all my favorite dishes!\u201d Wolf happy at the knowledge that the people she loved liked each other, she feathered her fingers through the hair that brushed his nape. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d she asked, so content in this moment that it hurt.</p><p>\u201cThough the births were spread out over fourteen years, Judd, Kristine, and I were full siblings,\u201d he said, running his fingers over her thigh. The caress made her suck in a breath, but she didn\u2019t push for sexual skin privileges. Not now, when Walker was opening up to her in a way she\u2019d never expected. \u201cIt made logical sense since the combination of maternal and paternal DNA kept creating high-Gradient offspring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds . . . but I guess that\u2019s the way it is in the Net.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My daughter was conceived by the same method.\u201d</p><p>But not brought up in the cold, Lara thought. Marlee had always been a child confident in her father\u2019s protection and love, even when they\u2019d first defected. \u201cYou\u2019re a good father, Walker,\u201d she said, placing her free hand on his cheek. \u201cYou understand children.\u201d</p><p>Shadows moved across those rugged features. \u201cThat\u2019s why they put me in charge of the telepathic children drafted into the Arrow Squad.\u201d</p><p>Lara wasn\u2019t shocked. Part of her had always known he\u2019d been no ordinary teacher. Linking her arms around his neck, she leaned her head against his shoulder and said, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>As the minutes passed, Walker relaxed against the sofa, his hand smoothing up and down her back. Then he began to speak, telling her of being taken from his classroom as a twenty-two-year-old barely out of college and assigned to a school that offered intense one-on-one sessions to its students. \u201cAges four to ten,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know then that the children were apprentice Arrows, but I saw at once why they\u2019d been segregated, understood that they needed dedicated training.\u201d</p><p>Lara didn\u2019t know much about Arrows, but she knew Judd had been one, and so she could guess. \u201cTheir strength was dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He tugged her closer, his hand rubbing the sensitive skin of her thigh. \u201cI had no problem with my reassignment, with helping the children harness their abilities.\u201d</p><p>She nuzzled at him, the act affectionate, nonsexual. \u201cSomething changed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leaning into the tiny kisses she brushed over his neck, he said, \u201cDay by day, I began to see the light go out of my students\u2019 eyes in a way that was more profound than could be attributed to the Protocol.\u201d The hand on her back slid down to clench on her hip, hard enough that she knew he wasn\u2019t aware of it. \u201cThen I began to notice how many of them missed a day or two for medical reasons.\u201d</p><p>Lara\u2019s eyes burned, her healer\u2019s heart able to guess what was coming.</p><p>\u201cArrows are taught from childhood not to feel pain,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe easiest way to do that is to put them through such excruciating pain that the mind learns to shut it out. The side effect, of course, is that it turns them into merciless killers.\u201d</p> <p>Lara swallowed her tears. \u201cJudd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a Tk, he had a different teacher in a different location. His name was wiped from the family records, and according to the PsyNet he no longer existed.\u201d The people who had sired Walker, Kristine, and Judd had signed away their rights to their child when he became too difficult to handle. \u201cI had no idea where he was until he was old enough to skirt the psychic safeguards of his trainers, locate and teleport to my apartment.\u201d</p><p>Walker thought of the first time he\u2019d seen his now teenaged brother, glimpsed that same dead expression in Judd\u2019s eyes that he saw daily on the faces of the children he taught. The only thing that had kept him going was that Judd had come home. Even after everything they\u2019d done to him, he had come home.</p><p>Lara\u2019s hand curved gently around his nape. \u201cHe came to you, not your parents.\u201d</p><p>That she understood the words he didn\u2019t say, couldn\u2019t speak . . . \u201cWe had no connection to them beyond our biology.\u201d Fisting one hand in her springy curls, he anchored himself to the present. \u201cDefection wasn\u2019t something we even considered at that time. There was nowhere for us to go, the Council was so powerful.\u201d All he\u2019d been able to do was ensure that his brother knew he hadn\u2019t been forgotten, would never be forgotten.</p> <p>Then history had begun to repeat itself with Sienna, and it was the final straw. \u201cLara, I need you to know\u201d\u2014because he didn\u2019t ever want her to look at him and wonder\u2014\u201cI never hurt a child in my care.\u201d He\u2019d risked everything to teach his students telepathic tricks they weren\u2019t permitted to know, and then he\u2019d taught them how to hide the knowledge. It had been the only weapon he could give those small, vulnerable minds.</p><p>\u201cOh, Walker, I know you would never harm a child. I know.\u201d</p><p>The unswerving conviction in her voice, it destroyed something hard and dark and ugly inside of him, sanded away more and more of those jagged edges. His lips were on hers before he knew he was moving, the warm strength of her a benediction he\u2019d never expected.</p><p>SIENNA didn\u2019t realize anything was wrong until after Hawke fell asleep, having first exhausted her into limp incoherence. When she\u2019d recovered after that second loving to complain that she hadn\u2019t gotten a chance to explore his body yet, he\u2019d laughed and promised that she could have her turn\u2014after he got the edge off.</p><p>\u201cPretty long edge,\u201d she\u2019d gasped ten minutes later, hair falling around her face as he slid into her from behind for the second time.</p><p>That had earned her a kiss on the back of her neck, his fingers curving down to flick the tight bundle of nerves at the apex of her thighs. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d A knowing touch circled her clit as she quivered from the shock of his first caress. \u201cSee that chair? Having you astride me is next on my list.\u201d</p> <p>The rough greed in his voice had sent heat rocking over her body, a darkly pleasurable sensation. However, this, what she felt now, was uncomfortable, as if her body was boiling from the inside out. Wiggling out from under Hawke\u2019s arm, she muttered, \u201cBathroom,\u201d when he would\u2019ve stopped her, and made her way to the private alcove at the back of the cabin. Throwing water onto her face, she wiped it with a towel, but her skin continued to burn.</p><p>That was when she looked in the mirror.</p><p>And stopped breathing.</p><p>Her eyes were gold\u2014blazing, flickering gold. Swallowing, she tried to quiet the panic that had her pulse in her mouth. The second level of dissonance hadn\u2019t kicked in, so whatever had caused this, it didn\u2019t indicate a dangerous loss of control. With that reassuring thought, she went within her mind, ready to reinforce the shields that contained the buildup of X-fire. To find them burned out. Oh, God.</p><p>The lines of dissonance programming had literally been buried under an avalanche of power. That should\u2019ve been impossible\u2014the pain should\u2019ve blanked her into unconsciousness long before it got to that stage . . . except she was an X. A cardinal. No one knew how her power functioned, not in truth.</p><p>Connected as the events seemed, she knew the collapse wasn\u2019t as a result of the emotional impact of the previous two nights\u2014her response to Hawke had been wild and dark and passionate long before they\u2019d shared intimate skin privileges. \u201cCalm,\u201d she said out loud. \u201cCalm.\u201d When she had some kind of a handle on herself, she began to rebuild that which had been burned away . . . only to watch as the cold fire began to devour it at almost the same instant.</p><p>Horror filled her veins, speared through her mind.</p><p>But at the center of it was a cold, clear understanding.</p> <p>She\u2019d thought she\u2019d beaten the X-marker, but all she\u2019d done was corral it\u2014there was no way to stop its progression. Her periodic purges had acted as a pressure regulator, but that regulator was no longer big enough. The power had grown in an exponential cascade over the hours she\u2019d slept, until it was a massive beast shoving at her shields, wanting out.</p><p>All indications are that your power develops in erratic and unpredictable surges. At some stage, the surge will overwhelm.</p><p>She\u2019d forgotten Ming\u2019s prediction, or perhaps she hadn\u2019t wanted to remember it. In this, the bastard had proven right. \u201cNo panic, Sienna. Think.\u201d Pacing in the confines of the bathroom, she realized the first thing she needed to do was earth the cold fire, buy some time.</p><p>It took her five minutes to sneak outside without waking Hawke, and she was convinced he didn\u2019t rise only because he could scent her and knew she was safe. The instant her bare feet hit the forest floor, she punched her power into it, the ground burning with phantom flames for almost a minute before the X-fire soaked into the earth.</p><p>Yet when she looked into her mind, she saw that by morning, the buildup would be close to critical once more. The cold fire was voracious, and it wanted to consume everything in its path, but that wasn\u2019t the most terrifying truth she saw inside the conflagration of her mind. Synergy, the catastrophic crest of an X\u2019s power, wasn\u2019t just possible, it was highly probable.</p><p>There was no going back once an X hit synergy.</p><p>Glancing behind her at the cabin, she rebuilt a second layer of shields before walking back inside. Her eyes had returned to normal, and so she allowed herself to stay with Hawke, to sleep in his arms this night.</p><p>One last night.</p><p>Chapter 48</p><p>MORNING CAME TOO soon, and along with it, the harsh reality of the inevitable consequences of the amplification in her power levels. She was grateful for Riley\u2019s early morning call seeking to talk over a security issue with Hawke. It gave her an excuse to keep the discussion on martial matters on the drive back, a topic she could handle even with her concentration fractured.</p><p>Her luck ran out when they reached the den.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Fingers gripping her chin, wolf-blue eyes piercing her through and through. \u201cDid something I do last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she interrupted, wanting nothing to tarnish the memory of that wonderful, impossible, beautiful night. \u201cI guess I\u2019m just . . . processing.\u201d Not a lie.</p><p>A slow smile. \u201cHere\u2019s something else for you to process.\u201d His kiss burned her with a far more welcome fire than the cold that licked through the psychic pathways of her mind. But she couldn\u2019t remain in his arms forever.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, pacing from wall to wall inside her quarters. \u201cTime to think.\u201d She couldn\u2019t do anything about the buildup of power, not here, not now, but she could get the hell away from those who had no idea how close they were to an armed and deadly weapon. Once at a sufficient distance, she\u2019d have more room to consider her options, work out solutions.</p><p>In spite of the practical, positive nature of her thoughts, her heart was a lump of stone, terror crawling a thousand spidery fingers in her mind. Though she\u2019d earthed it only hours ago, her power was already at over sixtyfive percent. There was no escaping the cold, hard truth that there would come a time when she would turn into a living torch, her body spilling over with too much X-fire to allow even the faintest illusion of control.</p><p>He isn\u2019t my mate.</p><p>Pain roared through her chest, but for the first time, the idea of never having that bond with Hawke didn\u2019t tear her heart in two, but saved it. If he had been her mate, the shock of her violent death might\u2019ve been lethal. \u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered to whatever unknown deity had given her that priceless gift.</p><p>The LaurenNet, her family, they would be safe. Judd and Walker were strong enough to hold Toby and Marlee in the network after Sienna was gone. If she was less selfish, she\u2019d cut her link to the LaurenNet now, allow her mind to starve to death. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, hands fisted. That cold voice was Ming\u2019s, the voice of a man who\u2019d only ever seen her as a thing to be used.</p><p>But she was a sister, a niece, a cousin, a friend, a packmate . . . a lover. Suicide would forever haunt those she left behind\u2014Sienna knew that better than anyone. And, even though the odds appeared impossible, she\u2019d never been the giving-up type. She\u2019d fight to the bloody, bitter end to live.</p><p>Less than twenty minutes later, she\u2019d packed a small bag and was ready to depart, her power levels having punched up to hit seventy-nine percent. Seeing Hawke was out of the question, no matter how much it hurt her not to go to him\u2014he\u2019d know, and she couldn\u2019t afford for him to stop her.</p><p>Toby. Marlee. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her sweet, gentle baby brother, a boy who\u2019d already lost his mother, would also know, but she\u2019d have chanced that to hug him tight if she hadn\u2019t been so afraid her power would go unstable while she was still in the den.</p><p>Walker would protect him, she thought, fighting back tears because they had no place here, in the most crucial battle of her life. Walker would lay down his life for Toby. So would Hawke, Judd, Riley, Indigo, Drew, Brenna\u2014so many people loved him. Sunny-natured Marlee would reach him even if everyone else failed. And she could \u2019path him later when she was at a safe distance, make sure he wasn\u2019t afraid, that he knew she loved him.</p><p>Hawke isn\u2019t a telepath.</p> <p>Her eyes glanced off the phone she was leaving behind because it contained a tracking chip. She wouldn\u2019t be able to contact him if she failed in her last desperate attempt to contain her power, wouldn\u2019t be able to tell him the secrets of her heart. But he\u2019d know\u2014how could he possibly not know how much he meant to her?</p><p>The physical act of leaving was easy. No one had any reason to stop her. She didn\u2019t make any detours until she was well past the lake. Then she began to run, raising a wave of X-fire at her back. The intensity of it would erase the scents on the ground, in the air. Hawke might still be able to track her, but she had a head start and the most painful incentive to get as far as possible from those she loved. She would not murder them, would not become the monster Ming had trained her to be.</p><p>An hour later, her power hit one hundred percent.</p><p>HAWKE was speaking to Riley about Alexei\u2019s team of snipers when Toby ran up to them. The boy was so well behaved that the instant he grabbed Hawke\u2019s hand and tugged, he had both men\u2019s immediate and total attention.</p><p>\u201cSienna.\u201d Toby sucked in a breath, his face red, his chest heaving. \u201cShe\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p> <p>Hawke\u2019s wolf went predator-quiet. \u201cWhere is she, Toby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Stark terror in the skin stretched tight over his skull. \u201cHer star is like ice in our net. But there\u2019s fire inside.\u201d Trembling voice, a sheen of wet on those eyes. \u201cYou have to help her.\u201d</p><p>Hawke took Toby\u2019s face in between his palms, captured the boy\u2019s distraught gaze with his own. \u201cYou did the right thing coming to me. I\u2019ll find her.\u201d Always. She was his.</p><p>Toby gave a jerky nod. \u201cYou gotta go. I think she\u2019s running away.\u201d</p><p>No way in hell.</p><p>\u201cRiley.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got him.\u201d Riley put his hand on top of Toby\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d both man and boy said.</p><p>He left, fury beating in every pulse of his blood. Did she really think he\u2019d let her go? That he\u2019d lie down and accept the fact that she\u2019d cut and run? If she had, she was going to get a nasty surprise when he caught up to her. Because Hawke was feeling all kinds of mean.</p><p>A single question and he knew she hadn\u2019t checked out any of the vehicles. Which meant she was on foot. He shifted to wolf form mid-run, following her scent out of the den and to the lake. Anger had his wolf digging its claws into the earth, but worse was the jagged sense of betrayal. How dare she do this? How dare she think to isolate herself in this way? They were going to have the mother of all fights when he caught up to her.</p><p>Which he would do, very, very soon.</p><p>Sienna was smart, but she wasn\u2019t wolf, wasn\u2019t alpha. He lost her scent at the lake. It didn\u2019t matter. Because he knew her. He also knew this territory like the back of his hand. Cutting across the land with the speed of a predator infuriated with the woman he\u2019d claimed as his own, he planned to head her off in under three hours.</p><p>SETTLING them in the break room off the infirmary, Lara made Toby and Marlee cups of hot chocolate, and handed out cookies. \u201cSienna will be fine,\u201d she said, ignoring the tear tracks Toby furtively wiped away, and hoping her words weren\u2019t a lie. \u201cHawke\u2019s gone after her.\u201d Hawke always ran his prey to ground. Always.</p><p>Marlee scrunched up her nose. \u201cI bet he was mad.\u201d</p> <p>Toby nodded to his younger cousin. \u201cYeah, Sienna\u2019s in big trouble.\u201d</p><p>They began to discuss whether they wanted to swap their cookies.</p><p>Startled, Lara looked up to meet Riley\u2019s gaze. The lieutenant gave a single satisfied nod before leaving the children in Lara\u2019s care\u2014though Lara wasn\u2019t certain they were as sanguine about the situation as they appeared, especially Toby. But, having dealt with more than her share of boys, she didn\u2019t fuss. Instead, she moved around to fix the ribbon on Marlee\u2019s braid. \u201cDid you tell your dad what was happening?\u201d Walker would want to know as soon as possible.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Marlee nodded. \u201cHe was helping Riaz with the older kids far away. He\u2019s coming home though.\u201d Eyes identical to her father\u2019s pinned Lara to the spot when she finished with the ribbon. \u201cBen says you smell like my dad.\u201d</p><p>Lara hesitated, glanced at Toby . . . to see no surprise on the boy\u2019s face. Of course not. He was empathic, had to have picked up the undercurrents long ago. \u201cDoes that bother you?\u201d she asked both children.</p><p>Toby just shook his head, but Marlee dunked her cookie and took a bite before saying, \u201cNo, Dad needs someone to cuddle him, too.\u201d A brilliant smile. \u201cAnd me and Toby, we think you\u2019re pretty great.\u201d</p><p>Wanting to smile at the idea of anyone cuddling Walker, Lara pressed a kiss to Marlee\u2019s cheek before moving over to pour Toby some more hot chocolate. \u201cYou need anything else, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>Toby looked up, a quiver in his lower lip that he bit down to still. \u201cA hug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Toby.\u201d Going to her knees, she embraced him tight. \u201cWe won\u2019t permit her to handle this alone. We\u2019re pack.\u201d</p><p>A small hand brushed over her own as Marlee patted Toby\u2019s back. \u201cDon\u2019t be sad, Toby. Hawke won\u2019t bite her very hard for running away.\u201d</p><p>Toby\u2019s eyes went huge as he drew back from the hug . . . and then he started laughing, turning to wrap one arm around his grinning cousin\u2019s neck to tug her to his side.</p><p>From the mouths, Lara thought, her own lips twitching, of babes.</p><p>SWEAT was trickling down Sienna\u2019s back, her face, pasting tendrils of hair to her temples when she crested the rise and found herself two meters from a very pissed off wolf. \u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou can\u2019t be here.\u201d In the hours since she\u2019d left the den, she\u2019d realized that there was no way to turn back the psychic clock, no way to escape the inevitable. The only thing she could do was make sure she didn\u2019t take anyone else with her. \u201cGo back.\u201d</p><p>The wolf snarled, lips peeled back to display razor-sharp canines.</p><p>It was difficult to stand her ground when all she wanted to do was go to her knees, wrap her arms around him, and ask him to make it alright. But even Hawke couldn\u2019t fix this, fix her. \u201cI\u2019m close to a lethal breach,\u201d she said, breath coming in ragged gasps. \u201cYou have to leave.\u201d</p><p>His response was to pace around her in a slow, predatory sweep. Dropping her pack, she swigged from the bottle of water she\u2019d refilled at a stream an hour ago. \u201cStop trying to intimidate me and listen, you stubborn wolf!\u201d</p><p>Pale eyes dared her to continue.</p><p>She folded her arms. \u201cI\u2019m not being melodramatic or a diva or a child.\u201d The time alone in the wide-open spaces of the Sierra had given her room to breathe, quiet the nascent panic to cold reason. \u201cMy power is amplifying at an exponential rate. I could go active at any time\u2014in the bedroom, at the infirmary, in the nursery.\u201d</p><p>Hawke walked over to stand right in front of her, his ears pricked, his body motionless. She wasn\u2019t surprised in the least when he shifted in a storm of light and color. When it passed, he towered over her, his anger as feral as it had been in wolf form. \u201cYou. Left. Me.\u201d</p><p>It was the last thing she\u2019d expected him to say. \u201cIt was for the best.\u201d He had her scrambling backward before she realized it. Her back hit a tree trunk. \u201cI\u2019m dangerous. I\u2014\u201d His mouth on her own, his hand gripping her at the nape as his body pinned her against the tree.</p><p>She should\u2019ve resisted, but how was she supposed to exercise restraint when he was everything she had ever wanted?</p><p>Seventy-three percent.</p><p>Time, she had time enough to love him. Rising on tiptoe, she gripped at his waist as she met him kiss for kiss, breath for breath.</p><p>When he reached down and ripped open the button-fly of her cargo pants, she kicked them off after toeing off her boots. Her panties were in shreds an instant later. She shifted her grip to his shoulders as he lifted her up, wrapping her legs around his waist. And shuddered, her every nerve sparking with near-painful need as he claimed her with a single primal thrust.</p><p>But even wild with possessive fury and animal need, he remembered to brace one arm around her lower back, the other around her shoulders, so she didn\u2019t get pounded into the rough bark of the tree. Then he took her, kissing her with such ferocious demand that she could do nothing but give him everything he wanted.</p><p>\u201cYou left me.\u201d A husky accusation against her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Fisting her hand in his hair, she kissed him in ragged apology\u2014she couldn\u2019t say she wouldn\u2019t do it again. That choice had been taken out of her hands the instant she\u2019d been born an X. \u201cLove me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>THEY sat in the silver-green shade of the tree afterward, its branches shimmering in the sunlight. Sienna had managed to knot the top of her cargos across her hips, though they hung precariously low, while Hawke sat unashamedly naked, with her in his lap. His chin lay on her hair, one muscular arm around her shoulders, his free hand heavy on her thigh.</p><p>Head on his shoulder, she traced her fingers through the soft hairs on his chest. \u201cI thought I\u2019d beaten it. I thought I\u2019d be the X who survived, but I was just fooling myself. I should\u2019ve looked more carefully, should\u2019ve realized\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had no one to teach you,\u201d he said with changeling fierceness. \u201cYou\u2019re doing the best you can in a wilderness no one knows how to navigate.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI never said,\u201d Sienna murmured, \u201cbut part of me always thought we\u2019d find Alice Eldridge\u2019s book on X-Psy and that it would have all the answers.

I\u2019m not safe.\u201d Never would be safe.</p><p>\u201cThen we stay up here.\u201d An absolute statement.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt so cherished, so wanted, but she allowed herself only a moment to revel in the joy of it. \u201cNo. The pack needs you.\u201d</p> <p>Hawke\u2019s hand slid up to her hip. \u201cPack is built on the bonds of family, of mating, of love. You come first. You always will.\u201d</p><p>Tears burned at the backs of her eyes. \u201cYou are their heart, Hawke.\u201d Especially now, with Henry and his fanatics about to launch an assault.</p><p>\u201cAs you\u2019re mine.\u201d Reaching up to stroke the tangled mess he\u2019d made of her hair, he released a breath. \u201cWhen Rissa died, part of me broke.

You\u2014and only you\u2014hold the man\u2019s heart.\u201d</p> <p>Sienna froze. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t say that.\u201d They\u2019d never have the mating bond, but this, what he was giving her, it was as precious, as binding. As painfully beautiful. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh baby, you know I do what I want.\u201d Rubbing his chin on her hair, he squeezed her hip. \u201cMan and wolf, we both adore you. No way am I letting you go after the hell you\u2019ve put me through over the years.\u201d</p><p>He was teasing, but she couldn\u2019t find any laughter inside of her. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to stop this\u201d\u2014an excruciating, angry helplessness\u2014\u201chow to survive it.\u201d But she would find a way to send him back. Because SnowDancer needed him now, more than ever, this man with a heart so big, he\u2019d held a broken pack together and made it strong again, a man who\u2019d given sanctuary to the enemy . . . a man who\u2019d loved an X.</p><p>Chapter 49</p><p>JUDD RETURNED FROM checking out a warehouse the novices had fingered in the city to find Walker waiting for him. His brother had wanted to tell him the news about Sienna in person, and now they leaned against one of the huge glacial rocks that littered this region, their backs warm, their blood chilled.</p><p>\u201cHawke\u2019s with her,\u201d Judd said, and it wasn\u2019t a question.</p> <p>\u201cHas your contact found anything?\u201d Walker asked in a tone so devoid of emotion, it would\u2019ve been easy to believe he cared nothing for Sienna.</p><p>The same man, Judd thought, had taken a near-broken teenage boy into his arms and told him he would always, always be family. The fierceness of that quiet declaration had given Judd an anchor in the midst of utter darkness, given him the will to survive. \u201cI have a meeting with him tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are the chances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Three hours later, in the otherwise empty nave of an old, abandoned church he got his answer. It was a devastating one.</p><p>\u201cThere is no second manuscript,\u201d the Ghost told him.</p><p>A bleak gray invaded his mind. \u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Alice Eldridge had an eidetic memory. According to the records I was able to unearth, she burned her research notes on the X designation when it became clear that Silence was inevitable. The implication is that she did so in an effort to stop the Council using her research in ways it was never meant to be used.\u201d</p> <p>Judd didn\u2019t need the other man to spell it out. \u201cThe only remaining record was in Eldridge\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>It was the final staggering hit. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lose Sienna.\u201d A cold, hard rock in his chest, the knowledge that he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep the promise he\u2019d made to Kristine, wouldn\u2019t be able to keep her daughter safe. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to halt the buildup of cold fire once an X reaches this level.\u201d</p><p>The Ghost considered this, considered, too, what would happen if Sienna Lauren did survive. An X was power. A cardinal X was power without limit. She was a wildcard he couldn\u2019t control, one that might disrupt all his meticulously laid plans.</p><p>Then he looked at Judd, at the fallen Arrow who had walked with him even knowing what and who he was, who had kept his secrets. The Ghost knew nothing of friendship, but he understood loyalty and fidelity. He also understood that sometimes, plans needed to change\u2014and that change could be used to a smart man\u2019s advantage.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he said to Judd. \u201cI have something to show you.\u201d</p><p>Judd followed him down into the crypt, keeping enough of a distance between them that he was never in any danger of seeing the Ghost\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d the Ghost asked. \u201cYou know who I am.\u201d Perhaps the only one who did. Even Father Xavier Perez, the third part of their curious triumvirate, had never made the connection.</p><p>\u201cIf I am ever taken,\u201d Judd said, his words those of a man who knew danger could come as a silent shadow in the dark, \u201cmy mind is set with triggers that\u2019ll erase your name from my memory banks at a single mental command. Images are more difficult to remove.\u201d</p><p>So he\u2019d made sure he didn\u2019t have any images to erase. \u201cYou could\u2019ve ruled.\u201d For all of Judd\u2019s power, the Ghost had never before considered that possibility.</p><p>\u201cIt would have killed what remained of my soul.\u201d</p><p>The Ghost couldn\u2019t recall ever having had a soul, didn\u2019t know if he even understood what it was. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, pointing to a shadowy corner of the old and musty crypt.</p><p>Judd went motionless as his telepathic senses registered an unknown mind. \u201cWho?\u201d And what had the Ghost done?</p><p>The rebel leaned against the crumbling brick wall. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll believe me if I tell you.\u201d</p><p>Unable to detect any movement from the corner, Judd retrieved a slender penlight from his pocket and walked over to find a dust-coated glass box sitting neatly in the corner. It was about six feet long, a couple of feet deep if that, had fixtures that denoted a number of missing cables. Noticing someone had wiped away the sticky coating of dust near the top, creating a tiny window of clarity, he angled the cutting brightness of the light toward it.</p><p>A face looked out at him from within.</p><p>It was that of a small, fine-boned woman of mixed ethnicity. Her skin was a pallid brown, her eyes tilted up at the corners even in sleep, her skull smooth. Her hair had been shaved off, he realized, though there was no evidence of any electrodes ever having been attached to her skull. \u201cWho?\u201d he asked the Ghost once more.</p><p>\u201cThere is no second manuscript,\u201d the Ghost said, walking to stand beside him, \u201cbut you have no need of it. I\u2019ve brought you Alice Eldridge.\u201d</p><p>HAWKE had made Sienna promise to stay in place when he left to get supplies. She\u2019d broken that promise. But since he\u2019d found her again before he got too grumpy and hungry, he didn\u2019t snarl as he said, \u201cPut up the tent,\u201d and rolled the compact package to where she lay flat on her back, staring at the soft gray of the evening sky. \u201cIt\u2019s your punishment.\u201d</p><p>Clearly exhausted, she glared at him. \u201cDo you never run out of energy?\u201d</p><p>He pushed up the sleeves of his sweatshirt. \u201cI\u2019m alpha. Right now, I\u2019m a hungry alpha who wants to take a bite out of you for making me run the extra miles. Put up the tent.\u201d</p><p>She sat up but didn\u2019t touch the tent. \u201cGo bite yourself.\u201d</p><p>So, she was feeling pissy. That was fine with him. He liked it much better than the defeated pain he sensed had come close to breaking her earlier today. \u201cActually, I\u2019d prefer to use my teeth on softer flesh.\u201d He was reaching out to snag her when flames erupted along her back, in her hair. \u201cSienna!\u201d</p><p>She slapped up her hands. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t touch.\u201d</p><p>It was sheer hell to obey the order. He hauled her into his arms the instant the lick of red and yellow disappeared. \u201cHow bad?\u201d he asked, seeing the pain at the corners of her eyes, knowing of the second layer of dissonance now.</p><p>\u201cBad. But not the dissonance. As soon as the power builds to a certain level, the dissonance either disengages or somehow short-circuits.\u201d Her throat moved as she swallowed. \u201cAnd it\u2019s building faster and faster\u2014I earthed after you left.\u201d</p><p>He felt a lingering sense of ice\u2014cold enough to burn\u2014against his palm as he ran it over the silk of her hair. \u201cSienna, can the X-fire burn you?\u201d His wolf wasn\u2019t pacing anymore, its focus, the same focus that had helped a fifteen-year-old boy hold together a shattered pack, acute.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how Xs usually die, and if it reaches that point, then there\u2019s no predicting how far the resulting explosion will spread.\u201d Her smile was tight, painful. \u201cIt\u2019s why we\u2019re considered the most perfect weapon on the planet. An X can \u2018scorch the earth,\u2019 eradicating all that came before, but the damage to the environment is minimal. Much like after a real fire, the earth bounces back stronger and healthier\u2014and the aggressors have a clean slate on which to build their own empire.\u201d</p><p>He saw through the rational speech. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMing had a theory\u2014that if I could somehow purge my power on a level I can\u2019t achieve with the earthing, I could initiate a restricted burst from the nascent buildup that would consume only me.\u201d Her eyes met his. \u201cIf the flames ever turn blue . . . it means he was right. Promise me that you won\u2019t come near me if that happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said instead of giving her a promise he knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep. \u201cChange of location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d She grabbed the tent. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNearer a lake I know of up here.

But she threw off the shock to run to him at once, grabbing a scanner off a counter as she did so. \u201cWhat do I need to know?\u201d she asked as he placed the scientist\u2019s naked form on the nearest bed.</p><p>\u201cCryonic suspension,\u201d he said, head still ringing in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cImpossible.\u201d Lara put down the scanner, picked up a pressure injector, and pressed it to Alice\u2019s neck. \u201cNo one has ever been brought back from suspension with their mind intact. Even the Psy made it illegal over a half century ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was suspended before that, when the experimentation was at its peak.\u201d It had been a time of chaos and change when Alice Eldridge had been taken\u2014probably on the orders of a schemer in the Council superstructure who\u2019d had some vague idea of waking her up later when things had calmed down and she could be properly debriefed.</p> <p>But no one had ever come to wake her, her existence submerged by the wave of Silence that had swept across the Net. Perhaps the architect of her abduction had been killed, perhaps he\u2019d simply forgotten her, but whatever the cause, the result was that Alice had slept undisturbed for over a hundred years in a small facility deep in the Balkans. A facility that ran on solar power, but that had had no gatekeepers or personnel for decades, was listed as a storage warehouse. One so small and unimportant that it was continually pushed down the list when it came time for inspections and renovations.</p><p>Judd had asked the Ghost how he\u2019d found it.</p><p>The other man had looked at him with those eyes that held nothing of humanity. \u201cI found it because I go where no one goes. There are places in the Net that belong only to me.\u201d</p><p>Now, Judd shook off his tiredness over the dual teleport and told Lara everything he knew. \u201cShe was found in an experimental chamber created by a scientist who was considered to be on the verge of unlocking the secret of cryonics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he had, it wouldn\u2019t be illegal now,\u201d Lara muttered as she fitted a tissue-thin computronic skullcap over Alice\u2019s head and walked around to the control pad at the end of the bed to scan the readout.</p><p>For the hundredth time, Judd tried to sense if Alice\u2019s mind was active and came up against the same unexpected shield that had obstructed his earlier attempts. \u201cHe was a telepath, had a psychotic breakdown in which he destroyed his lab and all associated records before killing himself and his family.\u201d Perhaps that was the reason her abductors had abandoned Alice Eldridge\u2014no one knew what chemicals the scientist had used to induce suspension, much less how to reverse the state.</p> <p>Lara slammed a fist down on the control panel. \u201cShit,\u201d she muttered, staring at the woman who lay so lifeless on the bed, \u201cjust, shit.\u201d</p><p>Judd had never seen that expression on the healer\u2019s face. \u201cHow bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing\u2014I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s not like they teach us this at medical school.\u201d She leaned forward, hands clamped around the edges of the panel. \u201cI need Tammy and Ashaya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho first?\u201d He could do one more dual teleport.</p><p>A moment\u2019s pause. \u201cAshaya. She\u2019s not a medic as such, but she\u2019s a scientist\u2014and she can discuss the situation with Amara.\u201d</p><p>Ashaya\u2019s twin, Judd knew, was insane. No one trusted her, and she couldn\u2019t be allowed in the den, but there was no discounting her brilliance. \u201cI\u2019ll get Ashaya,\u201d he said. \u201cYou call Tammy, have her drive up.\u201d The teleport to Dorian and Ashaya\u2019s house wasn\u2019t difficult, since he\u2019d been to the location before. He had enough energy to bring the M-Psy back before he slid down the wall and to the floor of the infirmary.</p><p>The two women ignored him as they worked over Alice, with Tamsyn arriving seventy minutes later. Sometime in between, Brenna found him, just like he\u2019d known she would.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d she said, kneeling down beside him. \u201cYou\u2019re about to flame out.\u201d</p> <p>He gave a slight shake of his head. \u201cNot over the threshold.\u201d But he was slurring his words, so he leaned against her when she sat down beside him . . . and then he was stretched out with his head in her lap.</p><p>The last thing he remembered saying was, \u201cWalker, find him.\u201d His older brother had a way of seeing to the heart of things, would know whether or not they should tell Sienna what had happened when there was a good chance Alice Eldridge would never wake. Even if she did, there was no guarantee she\u2019d be able to tell them anything\u2014the Ghost had found data that suggested she may have asked an E to wipe that part of her memory clean.</p><p>SIENNA scraped a kick by Hawke\u2019s ear as the stars turned into glittering beacons overhead. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay up here,\u201d she said as he made a fluid move to avoid the blow. \u201cYou know that.\u201d No matter how well prepared his people, how well drilled, they were changeling, were wolf\u2014without their alpha, the pack would be lost, rootless. More, she understood his wolf needed to stand in the line of fire, to be SnowDancer\u2019s first line of defense.</p><p>He danced out of the way of her strike. \u201cYou can do better than that, baby.\u201d Blocking her next kick with his hand, he pushed up until she had no choice but to flip and come down hard on her feet. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you up here alone.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d suggested a bout of hand-to-hand sparring, she\u2019d figured she might as well accept since she wasn\u2019t going to sleep. Now she knew his cunning plan\u2014to exhaust the argument right out of her. But they both knew she was right. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said after her teeth stopped vibrating. \u201cI have supplies.\u201d Taking a moment to catch her breath, she decided it was unfair he had that lickable upper body on display. \u201cPut your sweatshirt back on.\u201d</p><p>His eyes gleamed wolf-blue in the night. \u201cCome closer and make me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips twitched, though she\u2019d thought the cold fire had seared the laughter right out of her heart. \u201cMaybe I should take off my own top.\u201d</p><p>A smile full of teeth. \u201cMaybe you should.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she set her feet for another attempt at taking him down. \u201cTalk me through the pack\u2019s defensive plans.\u201d If she managed to hold off synergy, then she might yet be able to assist SnowDancer.</p><p>Moving with lethal grace around her, Hawke spoke, listened when she asked questions or made suggestions. There was a perfection to the moment that made Sienna think: Yes, this is it. This is who we\u2019re meant to be together.</p><p>If she could have, she would\u2019ve frozen time at that instant, but second by second, minute by minute, the stars would dim, the sky would lighten\u2014until dawn streaked a brilliant explosion of color across the Sierra. As brilliant as the cold fire inside of her, voracious and violent.</p><p>\u201cSienna, your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Stepping a small distance away, she let the flames pour out of her and into the earth in a storm of wildfire that was an impenetrable wall between her and her wolf.</p><p>Chapter 50</p><p>HAWKE HUNG UP the sat phone feeling as if he\u2019d been punched in the chest by a granite fist. Sienna glanced back at him from where she sat on the edge of the lake, the early morning sunshine dancing over hair as black as the heart of a ruby. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dead woman come back to life.\u201d When he told her what\u2014who\u2014Judd had brought home, hope flared a shiny new coin in her eyes for a single bright second.</p><p>It turned dull almost as fast. \u201cThere\u2019s no knowing if she\u2019ll ever wake,\u201d Sienna said, \u201cmuch less if she\u2019ll come back whole. I have to stay up here.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d thought he could leave her, could sacrifice his heart for his pack, but now that the moment had come, man and wolf both rebelled. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, going to crouch by her side. \u201cYou\u2019re heading down with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawke, you promised you\u2019d listen to me about my ability.\u201d A firm reminder, but the fingers on his jaw were a caress. \u201cI know what I am. I know the destruction I\u2019m capable of\u2014don\u2019t make me kill those I love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re able to monitor your power levels, know when you\u2019re about to go critical.\u201d He\u2019d watched her leach off the violence of her ability twice more during the night, the flames seeming to flicker out over the lake itself.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t gamble on that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can move closer to the den.\u201d He wasn\u2019t used to losing.</p><p>However, Sienna\u2019s iron will was one of the things that had first drawn him to her. \u201cNo.\u201d Rising to her knees, she put her hands on his shoulders, no stars in her eyes. \u201cBut I won\u2019t go any farther from this point.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her, the wolf attempting to dominate her into acquiescence. Even when he said, \u201cPromise?\u201d there was nothing of acceptance in it.</p><p>\u201cCross my heart.\u201d</p><p>Hauling her against him, he branded her with his mouth, his lips, his breath before leaving with a single, furious command. \u201cStay alive.\u201d</p><p>WALKER knocked on Lara\u2019s office door that afternoon, wasn\u2019t surprised to find her still dressed in the clothes she\u2019d worn yesterday, black shadows under her eyes. This time, he didn\u2019t berate her for not taking better care of herself. Instead, he drew her into his arms, held her for a long moment before allowing her to pull back. \u201cEldridge?\u201d</p><p>Lara\u2019s gaze was bleak. \u201cThe scans detect brain activity, but that means nothing if we can\u2019t figure out a way to wake her. Ashaya and Amara came up with a chemical cocktail, which we shot into her a few hours ago, but so far there\u2019s been no change.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Walker knew both Judd and Sascha had been attempting to get through the strange shield around Alice\u2019s mind in an effort to nudge her to consciousness on the psychic level. Walker, too, had tried. To no avail. And now\u2014\u201cI have to leave.\u201d</p><p>Lara touched him in that wolf way, stroking back his hair, sliding her hand over his pectorals as if to smooth his shirt. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He bent toward her, making it easier for her to \u201cpet\u201d him as the wolves called it. \u201cHawke wants me with the children when they evacuate.\u201d The SnowDancer alpha\u2019s face had been drawn in harsh lines when he returned to the den this morning, but he\u2019d given the order to evacuate with a crisp, clear focus, as he had so many others.</p> <p>According to Judd, who\u2019d be back to full strength by tonight, surveillance at the South American compound was showing a rising level of activity as Pure Psy\u2019s people began to recover from the virus. The runway would be complete by tomorrow morning, which meant the compound had to be taken out of the equation tonight at the latest, before any of the weapons heavy transports took off.</p><p>Everyone agreed the children needed to be gone prior to that. Because once SnowDancer blew the compound, the war began. There was no hope of peace. Both Nikita and Anthony had attempted to reason with Henry in a last-ditch effort to halt hostilities. The other Councilor\u2019s response had been to try to assassinate them on the psychic plane.</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lara said, hand settling on his waist. \u201cYou\u2019re the perfect choice\u2014the kids will listen to you and feel safe at the same time.\u201d</p><p>Her immediate support of him, made an unexpected warmth uncurl in his abdomen. \u201cDrew\u2019s promised to spy on you for me and report if you\u2019re not eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sneak will do it, too.\u201d Her smile faded too soon. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing to ask of you right now, isn\u2019t it? To leave her?\u201d She wrapped her arms around him.</p> <p>\u201cSienna would be the first to tell me to go,\u201d he whispered into the softness of her curls, numbing the pain permeating his chest at the thought of the girl he\u2019d never been able to protect. The only thing he could do for her now was to ensure those she loved were safe. \u201cShe\u2019d do anything for Toby and Marlee.\u201d</p><p>Lara kissed him, hot and giving and possessive in a way he\u2019d never have expected from her before he\u2019d truly known her. Sliding his hand under her hair, he tilted her head, indulged in the wild sweetness of her for a moment out of time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll contact you as soon as we know anything,\u201d she said when they parted, her lips wet, her eyes determined. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep working with Alice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will.\u201d A piece of him threatened to shatter, a piece that bore Sienna\u2019s name, the name of a girl who was as much his daughter as Marlee. \u201cTake care of yourself, Lara.\u201d Because she owned a piece of him, too, a broken piece she\u2019d somehow soldered back together and that bore her mark now.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t say the words, had spent too long in Silence, but he\u2019d learned other ways to speak. Taking the paperweight she\u2019d knocked off her desk out of his pocket, he put it in her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s fixed. As long as you don\u2019t mind more than a few scars.\u201d</p><p>Tears in her eyes, she pursed her lips, shook her head . . . and held the paperweight to her heart. \u201cI love you, Walker.\u201d</p> <p>He left with those words held to the most secret part of him, but rather than joining the evacuation, he went up to where Sienna sat beside a wide, blue lake that mirrored the mountains with such perfection, it seemed there was no sky, only an endless vista of jagged peaks touched with snow. When she flew into his arms, he held her tight. And watched the cold fire of an X lick at her hair, over her spine. She wrenched away, her eyes dry of tears, her voice resolute. \u201cI have to earth.\u201d</p><p>He would\u2019ve waited, would\u2019ve done anything he could for the girl he realized had become a woman of courage and strength, but he knew she didn\u2019t want him to see her like this. So he walked forward, cupped her face, and pressed his lips to her forehead. Fight, sweetheart, fight.</p><p>As he turned away, he felt the earth shudder under a pulse of raw power and knew that if he looked over his shoulder, he\u2019d see nothing but a column of wild yellow and brilliant red, a woman consumed in flame.</p><p>HAVING confirmed that the warehouse the novices had found in the city held the weapons cache, SnowDancer blew the South American camp at midnight.</p><p>Stealth planes flew over the city at three a.m.</p><p>Pure Psy operatives began to appear along the SnowDancer-DarkRiver perimeter an hour later, pouring out from craft that landed just out of range of the anti-aircraft weapons over changeling territory, most covering the remaining distance on foot, while a front guard stood ready for teleportation.</p><p>The intruders were loaded up with so many weapons that had the changelings been relying only on their physical strength, the battle would\u2019ve been over before it began. As it was, Alexei\u2019s sharpshooters, along with those trained by Dorian and Judd, were in prime position to pick off those attackers who were teleported in. And the changelings had extraordinary night vision.</p><p>The enemy learned quickly and began to teleport in farther from the perimeter, inside DarkRiver land. But the leopards knew that land like the backs of their hands, and while their people were all in the city tonight, they\u2019d laid out a welcoming mat\u2014a number of the aggressors fell victim to their traps. And this time, there was no question about the enemy combatants\u2019 allegiance. They wore the emblem on their shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cA black spiderweb.\u201d Matthias\u2019s voice came into Hawke\u2019s earpiece. \u201cThat\u2019s Henry Scott\u2019s symbol.\u201d</p><p>Not unexpected but it was always nice to have confirmation. \u201cIf the enemy hits you with a psychic blow,\u201d he told his people as they prepared to engage, \u201caim at their heads. If you don\u2019t have a shot, turn around and run like hell until you get out of range.\u201d Changeling shields were strong, but they weren\u2019t impenetrable. \u201cI need live soldiers, not dead heroes.\u201d</p><p>A chuckle from the line, his wolves ready for battle.</p><p>Then Henry Scott teleported in onto the perimeter, surrounded by an armed guard so thick, it was impossible for anyone to get a shot in. The Councilor held up a hand.</p><p>Knowing time and the wind would only help his people pinpoint the locations of the Pure Psy teams, Hawke gave the order to listen.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d Henry said, \u201cis your last chance. Surrender and I will let you walk away.\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf wanted to rip out the man\u2019s throat, but it was better to let the bastard talk, find out as much as they could. \u201cNow why,\u201d he said from his position behind a slight rise, \u201cwould we want to do that when this is our land?\u201d Their home.</p><p>Henry Scott\u2019s voice was ultimately reasonable. \u201cYou\u2019ve been caught up in the middle of a political situation you have no hope of understanding. It\u2019s in your best interest to give in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say boys and girls?\u201d Hawke murmured into the mike worked into the collar of the thin black bulletproof vest he wore over a long-sleeved T-shirt of the same color.</p><p>The howl started at one end of the line and was carried from soldier to soldier, until it reverberated around the mountain. Hawke\u2019s wolf peeled back its lips. \u201cGo!\u201d</p><p>HAVING had a telepathic report from Judd as well as a call from Hawke on the sat phone he\u2019d left her, Sienna had earthed herself and double-checked her power reserves. The chance of an unpredictable spike remained, but since that wouldn\u2019t matter if the people she loved were dying when she could\u2019ve saved them, she took the risk of heading down.</p><p>She reached the combat zone just as hostilities began, the hairs on the back of her neck rising at the sound of the wolf howls singing through the air. Tempting as it was to detour, to glimpse the battle, she made her way directly to the spot Hawke had pointed out on the territorial map what felt like months ago. There was a pair of night-vision lenses waiting for her, along with a tiny key on a thin silver chain.</p><p>If you want to know what this opens, stay alive.\u2013H.</p><p>\u201cHello, wolf.\u201d Placing the chain around her neck, she slid on the night-vision lenses and began to scan the combat zone.</p><p>It was automatic to search for that vivid mane of silver-gold, distinctive even through the color distortion caused by the lenses. But she couldn\u2019t see it anywhere. Her heart stopped beating at the thought that he\u2019d been hit, was down, and then she realized\u2014every single SnowDancer in human form was wearing a knit cap over his or her head.</p><p>Yes, of course. The enemy would never know which one was Hawke, giving them no specific target. \u201cCome on,\u201d she said, whispering encouragement though she knew they couldn\u2019t hear her, \u201cwe can do it.\u201d That was when she spotted him, though his hair remained covered, his face turned away. Still, she knew the way he moved\u2014a human wolf. Her wolf.</p><p>HAWKE saw several of his people fall, knew they\u2019d been hit with a psychic blast. Racing out to the one closest, he pulled the male back out of range with a grip on his bulletproof vest, then went back to retrieve another, a woman. Around him, more SnowDancer soldiers were doing the same, as others fought off the Pure Psy operatives targeting those trying to assist the injured.</p><p>There was no doubt that Scott had a massive advantage with his telepaths and telekinetics, but from the looks of things, the Tk unit was beginning to tire from the troop movements\u2014which meant SnowDancer didn\u2019t have to worry about missiles being lobbed at them without warning, though the techs had prepared for that eventuality by placing a number of interception units along the defensive line.</p><p>The changelings had also evened out the field with preparation, the choice of when to fight, and the knowledge of home ground. Enemy soldiers who tried to teleport in behind SnowDancer\u2019s defensive line found themselves caught between layers of wolves arranged up and down the mountain.</p><p>Not all of those wolves were changeling.</p><p>Good, Hawke howled to the feral wolves that treated him as alpha. Watch. Hold.</p><p>The wolves howled in unison in response, and Hawke saw the enemy freeze for a fraction of an instant. Then the crashing noise and blood-soaked scent of battle started again. Contrary to Hawke\u2019s expectations, Henry Scott remained on the field. The Councilor stood in the center of that tight guard, his eyes closed\u2014Hawke realized the man was using his considerable psychic abilities against the changelings at the same time that he saw a shot coming straight at a soldier. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDrew, duck!\u201d</p><p>Drew slammed flat. His gaze was annoyed when he raised his head. \u201cI swear to God, if I get shot again, Indigo will strangle me.\u201d Obviously irritated by that, he turned around and took out the man who\u2019d come after him just as SnowDancer\u2019s aerial defenses ignited an incoming vessel, causing everyone to run for cover from the falling debris.</p><p>Scrabbling up beside Hawke, Drew put his back to a tree. \u201cThat should remind them to keep the hell out of our skies,\u201d he muttered, then pressed his finger to an ear. \u201cI\u2019ve got info coming in from the Rats\u2014Henry\u2019s operatives are landing all over the place in San Francisco.\u201d</p> <p>TEIJAN and his people were used to being forgotten, being shoved aside. They were Rats, accustomed to living Below, where the world couldn\u2019t hurt them. But the DarkRiver cats had seen them, had treated them as sentient beings capable of giving something back. As for the wolves\u2014well, the Rats remained leery of them, but there was no arguing that SnowDancer had always held up its end of the bargain. More than one Rat had been pulled out of trouble or given protection by a wolf who was otherwise a stranger.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s home,\u201d Zane had said when Teijan had told his people what might be coming and offered them the option of leaving. \u201cWe stay and we fight.\u201d</p><p>Now, they did just that.</p><p>Having worked with DarkRiver over the past couple of months to connect with the cats\u2019 network of human and non-predatory changeling shopkeepers in Chinatown, that connection spreading out through family and business contacts like an ever-growing tree, the Rats had a flow of information coming in not even the PsyNet could beat.</p><p>They knew where Henry Scott\u2019s people were landing, their numbers, the approximate type and number of their weapons within seconds of each landing. All that data was routed at once to the DarkRiver teams in charge of holding the city as SnowDancer held the mountains.</p> <p>The tactical split showed a massive amount of trust from both packs\u2014because some of that mountain land was DarkRiver territory, and if San Francisco fell, then Henry Scott\u2019s army would have the perfect location in which to dig in and throw assault after assault at the wolves. Both parts of the defense had to hold if they were to win this battle.</p><p>\u201cA new team\u2019s rappelling down near Russian Hill,\u201d Teijan reported to Clay, \u201cand a bigger one has surrounded Nikita\u2019s building.\u201d</p><p>Clay\u2019s voice came through peppered with the sounds of gunfire. \u201cShe said she didn\u2019t need backup, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Teijan swore low and hard. \u201cNikita doesn\u2019t like people poaching on her territory. Fifteen attackers just went down with exploding brain syndrome.\u201d There was no other way to put it\u2014on the video feed coming through a street camera, Scott\u2019s people fell where they stood, their brains leaking out their ears.</p><p>The survivors wisely decided to get the hell out of Nikita\u2019s zone.</p><p>Teijan smiled, switched connections. \u201cThey\u2019re coming your way, Vaughn.\u201d He had, he decided, developed a sudden soft spot for Nikita Duncan, especially given that Psy loyal to her were also feeding information into the Rats\u2019 network.</p> <p>Catching a new piece of data, he switched connections again. \u201cLucas, I\u2019ve got jet-choppers flying into SoMa. You need to be prepared for aerial attack.\u201d Connected as he was to the communications systems, he heard the DarkRiver alpha say, \u201cJudd, can you deflect?\u201d just as the assault craft began to drop small, high impact bombs.</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d</p><p>On the screen, Teijan watched the bombs arrow back to the jet-choppers, turning them into spectacular fireballs.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d Zane muttered from where he was holding contact with the wolves. \u201cIt kind of freaks me out that this guy\u2019s been in the region the whole time without us knowing.\u201d</p><p>Teijan had met Judd Lauren earlier that day, had to agree with Zane. \u201cAt least he\u2019s on our side.\u201d Pulling up screen after screen of information, he patched in the telepaths and telekinetics supplied by Nikita and Anthony. \u201cFull unit heading through Chinatown to DarkRiver HQ. Ensure the guards are shielded against mental attacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood. Message communicated to all Tp units in range.\u201d</p><p>Zane tapped a screen. \u201cEnemy\u2019s ignoring the bunker,\u201d he said, referring to the third sub-basement of a building owned by DarkRiver on the outskirts of Chinatown but held under the name of an unrelated corporation. Right now, it was home to the leopard healer and her team, as well as the mate of the DarkRiver alpha, their child having been taken to safety by the evacuation team. \u201cWould you have your mate in a war zone, Teijan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cThe alpha pair must always be part of a fight. Sascha\u2019s safe in the bunker. Pure Psy has no idea it exists.\u201d If there was a breach, Teijan had a team standing by to whisk them out and away through the tunnels. \u201cWhoa!\u201d He punched a fist into the air as Judd \u201cFreaking Scary\u201d Lauren reversed a missile right into a stealthcraft, turning the night sky incandescent.</p> <p>But the sweet moment was cut short an instant later as Zane ripped off his earpiece, clapped his hand to his ear. \u201cOh fuck, something bad just happened in the mountains.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 51</p><p>AGONY HAZED THROUGH Hawke\u2019s brain. And he realized that Henry Scott might just have outthought them after all. \u201cBrenna,\u201d he said into the mike, \u201ccan you block that?\u201d It was almost impossible to speak.</p><p>Brenna\u2019s voice came out garbled, and he went to switch to a better channel . . . when he figured out it was his hearing that had gone, blood dripping down the sides of his face from violently ruptured eardrums. Unable to figure out what she was saying, he scanned the combat zone. A large number of his people were down, hands clasped over their ears. Others remained standing, but it was clear their balance was shot.</p><p>The only ones unaffected were the human members of the pack. In front of him, Kieran pushed aside a packmate in the line of fire and took on an attacker in hand-to-hand combat, while a reinjured Sam, his shoulder bearing a field dressing, dragged SnowDancer after fallen SnowDancer to safety. But there weren\u2019t many human packmates. Not enough.</p><p>Henry\u2019s men weren\u2019t even bothering to shoot anymore. Instead they were walking up to dazed and bleeding wolves, and smashing them in the backs of their heads. Prisoners, Hawke thought as he shot down as many of the enemy as he could, Scott wanted prisoners. To torture? For experimentation? It didn\u2019t matter. No SnowDancer would ever suffer as Hawke\u2019s father had suffered. He kept on shooting, covering those soldiers darting out to drag in unconscious or hurt packmates. But even with an alpha\u2019s strength, he was no longer as fast or as effective.</p><p>His people continued to fall under brutal crunches of bone.</p><p>They had one last weapon. His wolf had scented her on the air currents, the autumn and spice of her as vivid to him as the blood that saturated the air. The only problem was, he didn\u2019t want to use her that way.</p><p>SIENNA dug her nails into the pine needle\u2013strewn earth. They were falling onto their knees one by one, her friends, her family, Hawke.</p><p>Energy rippled through her body, a massive build-up of X-fire that would need to be earthed soon\u2014or used in combat, as it was meant to be used. \u201cHawke, I\u2019m here,\u201d she whispered, not knowing whether to intervene or to wait for the signal as agreed. If she entered the conflict at the wrong moment, she could ruin everything.</p><p>Suddenly afraid that there would be no signal because Hawke was dead, she spread out her telepathic senses in a desperate search. Her mind recoiled from that of another powerful telepath, but Henry Scott had sensed her. She saw his eyes flick open as he searched for the unfamiliar mind.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered as the attackers began slamming their weapons down on SnowDancer skulls. \u201cUse me.\u201d Let me do this.</p><p>Her breath was a razor in her chest when a howl\u2014broken, the cadence all wrong\u2014lifted into the air. It didn\u2019t sound like it should have, but she understood.</p><p>It was time.</p><p>Abandoning any attempt at secrecy, she walked out onto the night-cloaked battlefield bathed in the crimson and gold shimmer of cold fire. The enemy might have been Silent, but they went pale at the sight of her. An instant later, they began to shoot. She would\u2019ve taken evasive action . . . except the flames around her repelled everything, melting the bullets down to nothing, reflecting the lasers back at the shooters.</p><p>It was then that she realized Judd couldn\u2019t have acted as the failsafe. No bullet would\u2019ve gotten through. That wasn\u2019t the scariest part\u2014her link to the LaurenNet was shielded by cold fire even Sienna wouldn\u2019t be able to breach, the ultimate defensive measure from a martial mind. But that was no longer an issue. She knew what to do now, and she would do it after the battle was done and her pack was safe.</p><p>Angry and sickened at the sight of the broken and hurt SnowDancers around her, Sienna spread out her arms, palms facing the sky. And the fire with the cold, cold heart touched the enemy, and they weren\u2019t there anymore. She aimed the most powerful wave at Henry Scott, knowing he\u2019d try to get his men to teleport him out.</p><p>The bastard screamed high and shrill before he disappeared. She didn\u2019t know if he was dead, but she did know the attacking force should\u2019ve retreated at the sight of her. Yet bullets continued to fly, now aimed at the fallen changelings.</p><p>No.</p><p>Something arctic and dark and deadly rose up inside of her as the X-fire emerged in a straight line on either side of her body, cutting the enemy in the way in half and cauterizing the massive wounds with such flawlessness, it appeared the men had fallen into two neat pieces. The rest of them were trapped beyond the wall of voracious flame, but they continued to shoot. And then her mind, a huge, vast endless thing that saw and heard every sigh, every heartbeat, caught the whisper of more of them coming down through the mountains. They\u2019d slipped in past the defenses when the sonic weapon took out the changelings as well as the feral wolves, and now they thought to flank them from behind.</p><p>\u201cTraitor!\u201d The word came from the throats of those in front of her and she knew them then. Pure Psy. Zealots. They would not back down. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Very well.</p><p>The cold, dark thing inside of her shoved aside all else . . . and the flames began to feed. Screams filled the air, filled her consciousness, filled the sky. The monster inside of her, she thought with a small part of the endless vastness that was her mind, had seized control.</p><p>The problem was . . . the Psy weren\u2019t the only targets in the vicinity.</p> <p>HAWKE pulled his injured out of range of those Pure Psy operatives who\u2019d been trapped on this side of the divide when Sienna created that bladelike wall of X-fire. It was clear the enemy would not surrender, but trapped as they were, he offered them one final chance. The response was a hail of bullets, so he gave the order. When it was done, he checked on his people. Most were staring shell-shocked at Sienna as she blazed in a storm of crimson and gold, her hair flying in a terrible breeze, her eyes caverns of pure, raw power.</p><p>At first the wall of cold fire, it had touched the enemy alone, but now it changed shape, became a wave that rippled outward in both directions, growing ever closer to the injured and bleeding SnowDancers.</p><p>Ignoring the pain of shattered eardrums barely begun to heal thanks to his strength as alpha, he screamed, \u201cSienna!\u201d as he ran to her, even knowing she couldn\u2019t hear him inside the inferno that consumed her, until it poured out of her eyes, her mouth, her every pore and every cell. The cold burn of it hit him a meter from the quickly creeping edge.</p><p>He knew she\u2019d told him not to do it, that the X-fire would kill him the same as anyone else if she wasn\u2019t in conscious control. But he had to stop her, had to save her. If she took the life of even one SnowDancer and survived to witness what she\u2019d done, it would break her.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you better be in there!\u201d Running back, he got a racing start and jumped through the flames, expecting to fry. Instead, he slammed into her body, his arms going around her, but she didn\u2019t go down\u2014as if the cold fire had rooted her to the earth.</p> <p>Her eyes, those eyes filled with red and gold, so stunning, so lethal, seemed to see him for a second, and he was almost certain he heard, Forgive me, deep inside his head before a dark, endless something grabbed his mind, punching through with such savage force that it brought him to his knees.</p><p>Shoving aside the throbbing pain as the shock of the impact vibrated through his body, he raised his head and looked out through the wall of X-fire, saw the flames lick out and over his people at a speed not even a wolf could outrun.</p><p>No.</p><p>It spread, a crackling wave of wild color over the injured, over those that stood guard, over the sentries and into the forest, going endlessly in every direction until his people were consumed by it. Until they burned up in it, so fast and hard that there were no screams. Only a terrible, endless silence.</p><p>\u201cNo, Sienna, no,\u201d he said, rising to hold her to him in a futile attempt to get through to the woman behind the vast dark of ravenous power. She\u2019d come to save them, but what was inside of her, it had broken free, and now she killed the very pack she\u2019d wanted to protect. His wolf knew what he had to do, but he couldn\u2019t snap her neck, couldn\u2019t erase her.</p><p>God help him, he couldn\u2019t, not even to save SnowDancer.</p> <p>A minute, an eternity later, the flames blinked out, and Sienna sagged in his arms.</p><p>\u201cSienna.\u201d He was shocked by how very light she was, how very fragile. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare leave me.\u201d</p><p>When he raised his head, he looked first toward the Pure Psy side, unable to bear what he\u2019d glimpse on the other. Everything\u2014the enemy, the trees, the grass, the rocks\u2014was gone, smears of ash barely visible even to his night vision. Agonizing pain in his heart, he turned. And saw. \u201cOh, baby, I understand.\u201d So smart, his Sienna, so aware that his wolf would know each and every one of his people, feral wolves included. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for forgiveness, you hear me?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flickered open for an instant, and they weren\u2019t the night-sky of a cardinal. They were a startling, amazing gold untouched by crimson. \u201cA hundred years,\u201d she whispered. \u201cThat would\u2019ve been nice, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe LaurenNet link remains protected,\u201d she said, and he had the impression she was talking to herself. \u201cStrange. But it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Gold melting to blue in her eyes, she pushed him hard without warning, ending up sprawled on the earth. \u201cI love you.\u201d Blue flame licked up that wild tangle of ruby red, the scent of burnt hair sharp and acrid.</p><p>Man and wolf both realized what she intended to do, said, FUCK NO!</p><p>Using the doorway she\u2019d opened when she punched into his mind, the wolf shoved wild changeling energy into her, bowing her back, snapping her eyes open again, and shutting off that lethal blue flame. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d A question filled with horror as the violent snap of the mating bond brought him to his knees beside her.</p> <p>IN the middle of a San Francisco street under siege from two Pure Psy units, Judd clutched his head. \u201cNo,\u201d he whispered, and then there was no more thought.</p><p>HOURS away, in a protected safe zone in the middle of a different mountain range, Walker Lauren\u2019s mind went blank as something crashed into him so hard, he didn\u2019t even have a chance to alert the other guardians. The childre\u2014</p><p>Meters away, Toby lay slumped on a tabletop, while Marlee crumpled off her chair and to the floor.</p><p>IN the den, the command center was thrown into chaos as Brenna fell where she stood. \u201cJudd!\u201d Mariska yelled, slamming to her knees beside Brenna\u2019s limp body. \u201cFind out if anything\u2019s happened to Judd!\u201d</p><p>HAWKE allowed Lara to heal him first after it was all over, because without him, she would collapse under the weight of the injured.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Sienna?\u201d she asked him after she finished healing the remaining damage to his eardrums.</p><p>His wolf hated the answer he had to give, the choice he\u2019d had to make. \u201cI had Drew take her up to the lake in the mountains. She\u2019s unconscious.\u201d He didn\u2019t know what other mated pairs saw through the bond, but he saw rippling crimson and gold, their bond so raw and new it was a painful ache.</p><p>Right now, the X-fire was a placid pool, the battle had drained Sienna at such a deep level. But it would grow again\u2014colder, stronger, more voracious. When it did, the bond would give him enough warning that he\u2019d be able to take his mate deep into the lake, far, far below the surface. Where he\u2019d hold her as the cold fire consumed them both, its destructive fury dampened by the water. The stone walls of the den, far thicker and stronger than the rocks Sienna had neutralized, and reinforced with titanium plates in places, would protect the pack if the water and the distance weren\u2019t enough.</p><p>\u201cWalker and the kids?\u201d Lara\u2019s eyes were haunted when they met his.</p><p>He touched his hand to her hair in wordless comfort. \u201cIn the same state as Brenna and Judd. Do you want everyone moved here?\u201d Judd had been taken to the bunker in the city, while the others remained in the safe zone.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She began to heal a female soldier whose brain was swelling inside her skull. \u201cIt\u2019s probably better if we don\u2019t move them, since we have no idea why they collapsed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cats will come up to help once they take care of their own injured.\u201d DarkRiver had taken far less damage, would hold the city and the perimeter against any opportunistic attacks until SnowDancer was functional again. \u201cTake anything you need from me,\u201d he said, his wolf torn between his duty to the pack and his need to be with Sienna.</p><p>The only thing that soothed him, that allowed him to hold his focus on channeling pack energy into Lara, was that Sienna wasn\u2019t alone. Everyone in the combat zone had seen what she\u2019d done. Everyone understood the price she would pay. No one would leave her alone in the dark.</p><p>It was over five hours later when Judd staggered into the infirmary, supported by Clay and Vaughn. Since Lara, exhausted, needed a break anyway, Hawke sat her down with an order not to move, before turning to Judd as the other male braced himself against a bed. \u201cBrenna?\u201d the lieutenant asked, his voice raw. \u201cMy family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnconscious, but otherwise fine.\u201d Hawke pushed him into a chair when the former Arrow threatened to topple over. \u201cWhat the hell happened to all of you? Did Henry\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Judd was shaking his head. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>Hawke frowned, looked at Vaughn. \u201cDid he hit his head when he fell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMating bond,\u201d Judd muttered. \u201cShoved the balance\u2014\u201d It was the last thing he said before he slumped.</p><p>Clay caught him before he would\u2019ve fallen off the chair, and together with Vaughn got him into a bed in the same room as Brenna.</p><p>\u201cThe sonic shockwave was heard as far as the city,\u201d Vaughn told him afterward, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t strong enough to incapacitate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we have enough people to cover in case they come back?\u201d He knew Riley had been liaising with the cats, but he hadn\u2019t had a chance to talk to the lieutenant.</p><p>A nod. \u201cWindHaven falcons are sweeping over the area now\u2014it was a good idea to hold them in reserve. Rats have city intelligence covered.\u201d</p><p>Before Hawke could ask anything else, Vaughn clamped a hand over his shoulder. \u201cLook after your people, Hawke. We\u2019ll handle it.\u201d</p><p>Trust, Hawke thought, came in many forms. A baby in his arms. A surge of deadly flame licking over his people. A leopard guarding the gate. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>THE first thing Judd did when he managed to pierce the veil of consciousness at dawn was to check his mate and family were fine. The second was to find Alice Eldridge\u2019s bed, which had been pushed into a quiet corner of the hectic infirmary. She lay as silent and lifeless as ever, her secrets locked inside her mind.</p><p>Judd had a conscience. He also knew he might\u2019ve been tempted to tear Alice\u2019s mind apart in a search for answers if it would save Sienna, but whoever had taken Alice had done something to her. Her mind was sewn up so tight it was better protected than that of most Psy\u2014the problem was, Alice\u2019s shields had been locked into place. The only way to penetrate them without a very specific telepathic \u201ckey,\u201d now lost in time, would be to kill her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Exhausted, his head in his hands as he leaned his elbows on her bed, he almost missed the beep on the monitor above the bed. Then it sounded again. Jerking upright, he searched for Lara, saw Hawke carrying the healer into the office where she had a sofa. From the protective way the alpha held her, it appeared she\u2019d lost consciousness, unsurprising given the number of injuries SnowDancer had suffered.</p><p>\u201cAlice,\u201d he whispered, turning to clasp his hand around the woman\u2019s thin one as he kept an eye on the electronic readout above her head.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open. So deep and intense was the brown of her irises that it was difficult to distinguish pupil from iris even when she focused on Judd\u2019s face. Her lips parted, as if she\u2019d speak, but her throat emitted no sound. Squeezing her hand, he reached over to snag some ice chips off a trolley to wet her throat.</p> <p>\u201cArrow,\u201d she said in a hoarse whisper, but there was no fear in her, only defiance.</p><p>\u201cFormer.\u201d Perhaps he should\u2019ve waited, but he had to get the information while she was conscious and lucid. \u201cWe need to know if you discovered anything about X-Psy that would help save one about to go critical.\u201d</p><p>Confusion. \u201cX?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold fire,\u201d he said. \u201cX-fire. Remember.\u201d</p><p>Not even a glimmer of recognition and he knew the Ghost had been right. Alice had asked for her own memories to be erased. It had to be the reason why she\u2019d ended up in cryonic suspension rather than assassinated, her abductors needing time to work out how to retrieve the data. However, he refused to give up\u2014she\u2019d been in stasis for so long. There was no knowing how it had affected her mind. \u201cThe burning ones,\u201d he said, using every key word he could think of. \u201cFire. Flame. Synergy.\u201d</p> <p>An instant of piercing clarity. \u201cFind the valve.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 52</p><p>HAWKE FELT EVERYONE in the infirmary sag with relief when the first of the healers from the other sectors arrived. They\u2019d asked to come before the conflict, but SnowDancer couldn\u2019t risk putting all its healers so close to danger. But now, they were needed, and nothing could keep them away.</p><p>It cost him, but he didn\u2019t leave until the healers pronounced that the injured had been stabilized enough that he could take a break. He headed straight for the woman who was the beating heart of him. The tent Drew had rigged over Sienna\u2019s unconscious body was empty, their packmates having left when they sensed his approach.</p><p>It was as if she\u2019d been waiting for him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d It was a whisper so quiet, even most changelings wouldn\u2019t have heard it. But Sienna was Hawke\u2019s, had always been his, whether she\u2019d known it or not, whether he\u2019d accepted it or not.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he murmured, dipping his finger in a bottle of water and rubbing it over her lips. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A shake of her head, but her lips parted, searching for more. He trickled some into her mouth, making low, deep sounds of encouragement in his throat. \u201cCome on now. Open those pretty eyes for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what she meant by that, but driven by his wolf, he leaned down to nip at her lower lip. \u201cHawke,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the word you need to be saying.\u201d</p><p>Lines formed between her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cHawke,\u201d he repeated, squeezing her hip. \u201cHawke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawke.\u201d It was a sleepy murmur as her eyes flickered open. That cardinal gaze displayed a wild burst of unadulterated happiness for one stunning instant before it was wiped away by shocked horror as she scrambled up into a sitting position. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d A mental door slammed shut with such force it shot pinpricks of light behind his eyelids.</p><p>Snarling, he gripped her jaw, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare try to block me.\u201d His wolf began to batter at the wall it couldn\u2019t see but could feel, tied as they were by the mating bond, a bond that would never allow that kind of distance.</p> <p>The barrier broke in an avalanche of emotion, tangling them up until he could sense her in every part of him. Taking in a shuddering breath, he clasped her head between his hands and said, \u201cTry that again and I\u2019ll paddle you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cDon\u2019t you talk to me like that.\u201d</p><p>The laugh came from somewhere deep inside him. \u201cGood morning to you, too, sunshine.\u201d Then he kissed her. And kept on kissing her until she bit down hard on his lower lip. \u201cWhat?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cAir.\u201d</p><p>The gasp gave him the impetus to rein himself back. \u201cJudd said your family is okay.\u201d Hawke hadn\u2019t asked too much more, especially when the former Arrow told him what Alice Eldridge had said before lapsing back into the same comalike state she\u2019d been in since entering the den.</p><p>REMEMBERING the wrenching sensation that had torn at her before she lost consciousness, Sienna closed her eyes and stepped out into what should\u2019ve been the LaurenNet.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t.</p><p>She blinked, shook her head.</p><p>\u201cSienna.\u201d Lips on her jaw.</p><p>She thrust a hand into his hair. \u201cStop distracting me.\u201d Yet she turned her face toward his, taking just a little more in spite of the dread that knotted up her throat\u2014and giving, too. He was changeling, touch essential to his happiness. \u201cThe LaurenNet is gone.\u201d</p><p>His head snapped up. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d She touched psychic fingers to the sparkling wolf-blue and flamehued rope that connected her to Hawke\u2014oh, God\u2014but tempting as it was to focus on the beauty and terror of it, she moved on, spreading her psychic senses.</p><p>She found Judd first, linked as he was to Hawke. Bonded to him was a mind Sienna was used to seeing in the LaurenNet, though it wasn\u2019t Psy\u2014Brenna. Judd was also connected in a wholly different way to another mind she recognized: Walker. She, too, was connected to both Judd and Walker, and all three of them had direct links to Toby and Marlee.</p><p>However, those weren\u2019t the only minds in this web.</p><p>Nine other minds, strong and wild in a way she couldn\u2019t explain speared out from the central core that was Hawke, spokes on a wheel. A tenth mind was held closer to his own in a more protective way. All were fortified by natural shields it would take savage force to pierce\u2014a stab of pain, of memory\u2014and not a single one was Psy. A number of other minds connected outward from the spokes.</p><p>\u201cI can see Lara, see your lieutenants,\u201d she whispered, amazed by how \u201cmessy\u201d this network was, so many intertwined and crisscrossing connections. \u201cIndigo . . . I know her. She\u2019s sparks and strength and life. And Drew, bonded to her so deep and strong.\u201d Her heart smiled. \u201cThat must be Cooper\u2019s mate.\u201d Ever here, he was protective, her mind tucked close to his.</p><p>\u201cRiley. I know him, too.\u201d He was the calm in the midst of the storm, the rock on which every one of them depended. \u201cStrange,\u201d she whispered, seeing how the most powerful bond Riley had disappeared into nowhere. \u201cMercy.\u201d</p><p>Strong, slightly rough fingers on her jaw. \u201cEveryone is safe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She touched psychic fingers to the bond that was Lara\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t like the others, and she knew on an intuitive level that the tie between alpha and healer had its own set of rules, as would the links between the lieutenants and the healers bonded to them. So complex. So glorious.</p><p>\u201cSienna.\u201d</p><p>Opening her eyes, she met those of a wolf. The LaurenNet, she thought, had held Judd even after Hawke blood-bonded him, because the neo-sentience within the familial network had known they couldn\u2019t survive without him. But what Hawke had done on the battlefield had tipped the balance\u2014and tied as the family was to one another, Judd and Sienna had wrenched everyone into the SnowDancer Web.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He kissed her hard. \u201cNow explain to me what the hell you thought you were doing turning yourself into a human torch!\u201d</p><p>Outraged by the accusation, she almost forgot what she\u2019d been going to say. Almost. \u201cYou idiot!\u201d She pushed at his shoulders, didn\u2019t manage to move him an inch. \u201cIt was safe! I was wiped out; the flames would\u2019ve consumed me alone.\u201d She\u2019d known after the X-fire slipped her grasp\u2014cold, such cold inside of her\u2014that it was the only way to ensure she\u2019d never again cause that kind of carnage. \u201cWhy did you stop me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI took what was mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I did\u201d\u2014sheer, unrelenting horror\u2014\u201cmight\u2019ve wiped me out for a short period, but I\u2019m not stable, Hawke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanted me to watch you burn? Fuck that!\u201d The wolf stared out at her, arrogant and insulted and furious.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t about to back down. \u201cYes! You should\u2019ve let me decommission the weapon.\u201d That was what she was, how she should be treated. \u201cCut it,\u201d she ordered. \u201cCut the mating bond.\u201d She\u2019d already tried to do it, found she couldn\u2019t\u2014it wasn\u2019t a Psy construct, followed no rules of psychic power that she knew. \u201cCut it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m changeling, baby.\u201d A growling statement. \u201cI couldn\u2019t cut it if I wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it,\u201d she said, shivering with panic. \u201cThere must be a way. I\u2019ll have to go into your mind and\u2014\u201d</p><p>His face was suddenly in hers. \u201cTry it.\u201d</p><p>Flinching, she went to do just that, because she would not hurt him, hurt any of them . . . and found she couldn\u2019t. He was inside her, her mate\u2014that impossible, beautiful word\u2014and the idea of violating him was anathema. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Her shoulders slumped. \u201cFor what I did before.\u201d</p><p>Bloated with power, she\u2019d torn through his shields and into his mind on that field of battle in a final, failed attempt at saving her packmates even as she incinerated the enemy. Hawke\u2019s wolf knew each and every one of his people, every inch of his land, every one of the wild wolves\u2014she\u2019d thought to keep them safe by \u201cshowing\u201d the cold fire that they weren\u2019t to be touched. \u201cHow many\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hurt no one in the pack.\u201d A ruthless tone that forced her to listen. \u201cNot a single singed hair aside from your own, you extraordinary, crazy, beautiful woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her lower lip shook, and then she found herself being wrenched forward into a crushing embrace, her face buried in his neck, her arms gripping at him. \u201cI was so scared,\u201d she whispered, because she could admit that to him, to her wolf, who saw her through to the very soul. \u201cEveryone\u2019s safe?\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cWe have a number of injured. Lara collapsed earlier, will get up in a while, start again. The healers from the other sectors have begun to arrive.\u201d</p><p>She recalled the sickening crunch of bone as Henry\u2019s men smashed weapons into the backs of skulls. \u201cWill it be enough?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d The harsh truth of an alpha. \u201cBut we won\u2019t give up as long as they\u2019re hanging on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there\u2014\u201d She swallowed the huge lump in her throat. \u201cMy friends?\u201d</p><p>His arms clenched around her. \u201cTai\u2019s critical. So is Maria.\u201d</p><p>No, no. \u201cEvie\u2019s heart will break.\u201d And Lake. Strong, capable Lake. He loved Maria with a tenderness that seemed to gentle even her reckless spirit.</p><p>\u201cNo surrender.\u201d Unrelenting. Inexorable. \u201cNever do we surrender.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo surrender,\u201d she echoed, then took a long, shuddering breath.</p><p>\u201cDoes the word valve have any specific meaning to you on the psychic plane?\u201d he asked, and when she shook her head, he told her what Alice Eldridge had said.</p><p>A sound of sheer rage escaped her mouth, and then she was punching her fist over and over against his chest. He let her expel the bitter anger, held her when she lay breathless against him. \u201cI almost wish we\u2019d never found her,\u201d she said, her chest rising up and down as she tried to gasp in air. \u201cI told myself not to hope, but I did.\u201d A tiny secret part of her had been convinced the scientist would wake with the answers just in time to save her.</p><p>Other men might\u2019ve given her pretty words of comfort, lies that meant nothing, but Hawke, he spoke to her martial mind, talking through the battle. \u201cWe weren\u2019t prepared for that sonic weapon.\u201d His tone told her that wouldn\u2019t happen again. \u201cBut because of you, we held the mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe city?\u201d she asked, her voice hoarse.</p><p>\u201cLeopards held it. A bit of structural damage but limited injuries thanks to the Rats, Judd, and Anthony\u2019s and Nikita\u2019s people. The Pure Psy operatives who survived turned tail and ran.\u201d He stroked his hand down her hair, long and slow and again. \u201cI can feel the cold fire along our bond.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d The battle had only wiped her out for a time. It had done nothing to change the fundamental truth of the power amplification. \u201cIt\u2019s at fifty percent.\u201d And it was frigid, until it froze her bones. \u201cIt feels stronger.\u201d Darker. More cruel. Fear curled around her throat, tight as a noose. \u201cCan we get farther away from the den?\u201d</p><p>Hawke didn\u2019t question her, simply said, \u201cI know a good spot.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d just stepped out of the tent when the power inside of her surged in a violent rage. Her knees locked, then gave out. She would\u2019ve crumpled to the grass if Hawke hadn\u2019t clamped his hands on her upper arms as the X-fire threatened to shove out of her very skin.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Even this deep into the mountains, the den was too close. Her friends, her family, her pack was too close. \u201cHawke, I can\u2019t hold it.\u201d Panic beat in her throat. \u201cIf I breach, it\u2019ll consume everyone in the vicinity.\u201d Her power had grown even more vast, even more voracious, would move out for miles in every direction.</p><p>Stone, steel, plascrete, nothing would stop its ravenous pulse.</p><p>Then she saw the scorching yellow and blazing crimson begin to divide and separate into pristine rivers inside her mind, in preparation for a final catastrophic merge. \u201cI\u2019m about to hit synergy!\u201d Turning her into a human bomb of incalculable destructive power, one that would obliterate any trace of two packs called SnowDancer and DarkRiver, of a city called San Francisco, of a mountain range called the Sierra Nevada . . . and keep going.</p><p>If you ever go supernova, Ming\u2019s arctic voice, the continent on which you stand might cease to exist.</p><p>Ming had been wrong, she realized in that moment when her power was so pure, so clear. There was no might about it.</p> <p>A warm male hand gripping her own, ripping her from the horrifying understanding of just what she was. \u201cThe lake,\u201d her wolf said.</p><p>She ran beside him. \u201cIt might blunt the impact.\u201d Part of her knew it wouldn\u2019t be enough, that even the deepest part of the lake couldn\u2019t contain the tidal wave of her power, but she had to believe. Then she felt an unexpected psychic burn inside of her, saw that the cold fire was eating away at her network shields, would soon pour out into the SnowDancer web in a violent storm. It had never before threatened to penetrate a psychic network\u2014but she\u2019d never been this close to synergy.</p><p>Fear twisted knives of ice through her heart as they hit the water. \u201cHawke! The X-fire is spreading on the psychic plane. I can\u2019t cut my mental bonds, but you can\u2014\u201d</p><p>Wolf-blue slammed into her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare ask me to hurt you. Don\u2019t you fucking dare.\u201d</p><p>Pain ripped her in two, the world already tinged crimson and gold, and she realized her eyes were drowning in X-fire. A single tear trailed down her cheek as the frigid water reached her thighs. \u201cI\u2019ll burn out your mind.\u201d</p><p>He continued to swim farther into the lake, pulling her along. \u201cThe others?\u201d</p><p>The water hit her breasts, soaked into her chest, into her bones. \u201cThe web\u201d\u2014she kicked her legs in an attempt to help him\u2014\u201cwill collapse without you.\u201d He was the center, the key. Had her family been part of it longer, they could\u2019ve built failsafe bonds, but as it was, the web was a wholly changeling construct, created by ties of blood . . . Hawke\u2019s blood. \u201cThe changeling members won\u2019t suffer any ill-effects.</p><p>\u201cWalker and Judd\u201d\u2014she gasped past the cold that consumed her\u2014\u201cwill be able to drag the children into a smaller LaurenNet.\u201d She \u2019pathed Judd a warning. Her sweet Toby, and smart, funny Marlee remained unconscious, a small blessing.</p><p>\u201cWhen you die\u2014\u201d The words wouldn\u2019t come, and it had nothing to do with the fact that her body was in the coldest, deepest part of the lake. \u201cWhen you die,\u201d she forced herself to say, \u201cthe psychic shock will tear me from the web, regardless of the links to my family.\u201d He\u2019d become her anchor in every way and losing him would destroy her, ending her life and the threat of synergy. \u201cWe should dive just in case, but once separated from the web, I won\u2019t be a danger anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her wolf cupped her face, nothing but a wild devotion in his touch, in his voice. \u201cThen what\u2019s there to be scared about?\u201d</p><p>It broke her heart, that he was hers. \u201cI love you.\u201d I\u2019m sorry.</p><p>A caress down the mating bond, an untamed kiss that she knew was her wolf before he said, \u201cForever,\u201d and dived with her in his arms, the water closing over their heads in a sheet of sparkling blue.</p><p>Cold. So, so cold.</p><p>It was the last thing she had physical awareness of before the crimson and gold collided to create an inferno that poured over and through her shields with a vicious strength she could never hope to control. Hawke! It was a telepathic cry as the flame seared down the mating bond, turning it into an incandescent ribbon.</p><p>His arms clenched around her, shocking her back to the world for a single instant before she was wrenched to the psychic plane once again. She watched in horror as the rapacious tempest of her power surged into Hawke. Instead of burning out his mind, it encased it . . . and continued to spread out on the bonds that tied him to his lieutenants, their mates, the healers.</p><p>It wanted all of them.</p><p>No! No!</p><p>Chapter 53</p><p>THE FIRE RACED along the familial bonds, too.</p><p>First it hit Judd. Then it hit Walker. And held. She knew both men had risen to consciousness, were shielding to the limit of their strength to save the children as well as Brenna, but she also knew they\u2019d fail. The power continued to pour out of her, surge after surge after lethal surge.</p><p>For a blazing instant, the SnowDancer Web was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen, a brilliant gold and crimson network lit with pure raw energy. It spoke not of death, but of life. But of course, that was a lie. Even as the minds of Hawke\u2019s lieutenants blazed a terrible red, Walker and Judd finally broke.</p><p>WALKER knew the moment before Sienna\u2019s strength overwhelmed him that he was going to break. Reaching out with his telepathy, he knocked both drowsy children back into unconsciousness. They wouldn\u2019t feel any pain, have any awareness of going into the final goodnight.</p><p>Lara.</p><p>A single, painful thought before there was no more time. The brutal energy of an X shoved into his mind. For an instant, it was a thing of beauty, such unadulterated power that he was staggered by it. If only there was a way to harness this.</p><p>Then it rammed into his final telepathic shields, burning them to ash as the wave crashed. He had a moment to glimpse the web and think that the power was arrowing itself to him, as if he was some kind of lodestone. The flame\u2014so cold, so violent\u2014shoved into his psychic core a second later.</p><p>Death had never felt so exhilarating.</p><p>In the physical world, he went to his knees, his vision flame yellow and bloodred, but on the psychic plane, his telepathic reach was magnified a thousand times over for a gleaming instant, and he had time to be grateful that he hadn\u2019t been born that way, for a man was not meant to know the world\u2019s secrets.</p><p>He waited to die, to feel the frigid burn of an X\u2019s touch, but the power continued to pour through him. Gritting his teeth against the impact of it, he reached out to touch a telepathic hand to the children, found them unconscious but unharmed. That was when he focused his psychic eye beyond the avalanche of power. And saw something so incredible, it would\u2019ve brought him to his knees if he hadn\u2019t already been on them.</p><p>The strange twisting motion at the center of his mental star, it had nothing to do with children, nothing to do with telepathy. It blazed diamond bright as it spun at phenomenal speed, acting as a filter for Sienna\u2019s energy. The destructive potential was trapped, eradicated, the rest returned to the network. The interconnected threads of the web continued to burn but second by second, the vicious red was fading into a shimmering gold . . . until at last, there was no more raw power. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Walker\u2019s mind blinked out.</p><p>IT wasn\u2019t until two days later that everyone was functional enough to have a rational discussion. They met in the main conference room, the lieutenants from around the state coming in via comm feeds. Cooper\u2019s mate stood by his side, while the others in the SnowDancer Web, as the Laurens were calling it, took seats around the conference table. The only ones missing were the children, and the healers from the other sectors\u2014they\u2019d decided to head back home, leaving Lara as their representative.</p><p>\u201cThat was some trip,\u201d Tom\u00e1s said, breaking the ice. \u201cHoly hell, I was on speed for two days. I swear I ran patrol nonstop for thirty-six hours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe healed everyone,\u201d Lara said, flexing her fingers, her voice too jerky, too fast. \u201cEveryone in the infirmary, everyone in the pack that we could find with even the slightest injury. Anyone have a sore back? Scratches?\u201d</p><p>Beside her, Walker did something Hawke wouldn\u2019t have expected from the quiet, contained Psy. He put his hand under Lara\u2019s hair, curving it around her nape. It was a very changeling display of possession\u2014a signal to every other male in the meeting that Lara was now off-limits.</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf approved.</p><p>\u201cI had sex,\u201d Drew said with a grin. \u201cLots and lots and lots of sex.\u201d</p><p>Indigo threw a balled-up piece of paper at him, but she was grinning. Catching the paper, he said, \u201cHey, no use in good energy going to waste.\u201d</p> <p>Everyone chuckled, the atmosphere nothing like it would\u2019ve been a few days ago if they\u2019d been talking of Sienna\u2019s power. \u201cSo,\u201d Hawke said, playing his fingers through his mate\u2019s hair, \u201cit looks like we all got a boost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe acts like a mini-reactor,\u201d Walker said in that intense, contained way that had everyone paying attention. \u201cHer power is infinite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re going to keep getting mega-hits like this?\u201d Tom\u00e1s\u2019s dark brown eyes sparkled as they landed on Sienna\u2019s down-bent head. \u201cNot that I don\u2019t appreciate it, sugar, but it did make me \u2018hyper,\u2019 according to my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToby hasn\u2019t slept for two days and counting,\u201d Lara said. \u201cHe outran his changeling friends\u2014he thinks it\u2019s wuuuuuunderful. His word.\u201d</p><p>Sienna spoke for the first time. \u201cI think that was a one-off,\u201d she said, twisting her hands under the table where she thought Hawke couldn\u2019t see it. \u201cWalker and I have been talking, and our theory is that it was because I was trying to contain the power and it built up to a critical mass. If I release a steady stream of it, it\u2019ll boost your energy levels without having a discernible impact like it did this time around.\u201d</p><p>Leaning over, Hawke nipped at her ear. She turned bright red. \u201cHawke.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one is angry at you, Sienna,\u201d he murmured. \u201cLook at them.\u201d</p><p>He saw her raise her head, glance around, felt the staggering relief that poured down the mating bond. When she turned and reached up to pull his hand from her hair, bring it to her lips, he was undone, his wolf her slave.</p><p>Looking away from her only when she put his hand down on the table, her fingers tangled with his, he found the others had begun to speak amongst themselves, giving him and Sienna privacy. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Walker acts as a filter . . . a valve,\u201d he said during a lull in the conversation.</p><p>Matthias looked troubled. \u201cWhat if something happens to Walker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about that,\u201d Sienna spoke up, a confidence in her voice that had been missing earlier. \u201cThe helix appeared in Walker\u2019s mind around the time my mother was pregnant with me, so there\u2019s a chance one of the other Psy in the network would develop the ability.\u201d</p><p>If they were right, she\u2019d explained to Hawke, the implications were astounding. It meant the neosentience in a psychic network didn\u2019t only organize the network, it could influence it on the individual level. Which, if the rumors about the current rot in the PsyNet were true, led to some very disturbing suppositions.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d Sienna continued, \u201cwe\u2019re not relying on that. Now that we know what Walker\u2019s mind does, Judd thinks he can train his own to mimic the effect. It won\u2019t work anywhere near as well, and the power surge will be a lot rougher\u2014\u201d</p><p>Matthias cut her off. \u201cIt\u2019ll work.\u201d A fierce smile. \u201cThat\u2019s the important thing.\u201d</p> <p>Kenji glanced at Walker. \u201cDoes it take anything out of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Walker tapped a finger on the table. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve never felt more alive. For the first time in my life, I\u2019m making complete use of my abilities. The valve runs automatically in the background, so it won\u2019t interfere with my normal duties.\u201d</p><p>Jem stared at the Psy male. \u201cWow, I never heard you say so many words in a row before.\u201d</p><p>That made Tom\u00e1s and Drew burst out laughing. Alexei, Cooper, and Matthias were a tad more restrained, but even they had grins on their faces. Hawke\u2019s wolf laughed deep within. His pack, his mate. All here. Life was good . . . except for the fact the Psy Council now knew that not only Sienna, but the entire Lauren family, was alive.</p><p>WALKER kept his hand on Lara\u2019s lower back as they exited the meeting room. \u201cDo you have patients?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I healed everyone, remember?\u201d A sparkling look from those tawny eyes. \u201cEveryone! Even the ones who were dying. I was super-healer. Or okay, super-healer with super-healer assistants. Did you know Tai kissed Evie right in front of Indigo? With tongue. And Maria baked everyone cupcakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still power-drunk.\u201d It made sense. From what they\u2019d learned over the past few years, it appeared that there was always a neo-sentience in any psychic network, and even the most embryonic one would\u2019ve understood that the healers needed the power more than anyone else. Except that there\u2019d been so much energy, giving Lara and the others extra really hadn\u2019t been necessary. \u201cHow many fingers am I holding up?\u201d</p><p>Lara giggled. Slapped a hand over her mouth. \u201cI\u2019m so happy\u2014all those injured, healed. I actually ran out of people. Too bad Alice Eldridge isn\u2019t a wolf or I could\u2019ve woken her up. Elias is kinda mad I found him and fixed him up without leaving even a teeny-tiny scar that he could brag about. When are the rest of the juveniles coming back? I bet you they\u2019ll give me something to heal.\u201d</p><p>Hiding his laugh at the rapid speech that reminded him of his daughter\u2014who was attempting to break the world skipping record in the White Zone\u2014he nudged her in the direction he wanted her to go. \u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d</p><p>As she slid an arm around his waist, he said, \u201cDrew said he had lots of sex. Want to do that instead?\u201d He needed to claim her on a fundamental level, to touch and stroke and caress and know that she had come out of the flames of war unscathed.</p><p>Lara\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed his hand as if to drag him along behind her. \u201cHurry up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he said as they reached her quarters, \u201care you too power-drunk to give consent?\u201d</p><p>Lara recited the periodic table back at him. \u201cSee, all my faculties. Now can we have sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Her breath turned jagged when he nudged her back into her quarters and locked the door behind himself. Those big eyes didn\u2019t get any smaller when he unbuttoned and stripped off his shirt, then kicked off his shoes and socks. As he took the belt out of his jeans, she sucked in a breath, walked forward.</p><p>And bit him.</p><p>Right on his pectorals, sinking her teeth deep enough to leave a dark red mark. It snapped what control he\u2019d maintained, and he found himself picking her up and throwing her on the bed. She got up as if to get away, but he\u2019d been in the pack long enough to know her wolf was playing with him. Pulling off her shoes, he tore off her jeans and panties with a lack of finesse that might\u2019ve worried him if Lara hadn\u2019t been making low, needy sounds in the back of her throat.</p><p>\u201cTake off your sweatshirt.\u201d It was an order.</p><p>One she obeyed with shaking hands.</p><p>\u201cThe bra.\u201d</p><p>It was gone an instant later. However, instead of lying back, she stretched out on her hands and knees in front of him, looking up with a distinctively wolfish look in her eye. \u201cI\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d Solemn words that made him want to smile. \u201cI know you\u2019re a virgin. Psy don\u2019t have sex do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Intimate touch was forbidden in the PsyNet. \u201cBut I think I have the concept figured out.\u201d Surrendering to temptation, he stroked his hand down the curve of her back.</p><p>She arched into the touch, her skin shimmering with heat. \u201cAre you teasing me?\u201d A suspicious look, even as she rose up on her knees to tug open the top button of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d He bent down to nuzzle at her, biting her gently on the earlobe as he\u2019d done that night in her apartment when they\u2019d talked and done so much more.</p><p>She shivered. \u201cYou remembered.\u201d</p><p>He remembered everything about her, from the way she made those tiny sounds when he licked his tongue across hers, to the way she pushed her breast into his hand when he pinched her nipple. \u201cOn your back,\u201d he whispered, because the need in him was a demanding thing, one that wanted to brand, to claim in a way he\u2019d never before experienced or understood.</p><p>Obeying without argument, she braced herself on her elbows, looking at him with those brilliant eyes as he shucked his jeans. Her gulped in breath was a caress across his senses. Taking a grip on her ankles, he spread her thighs. \u201cWho do you belong to, Lara?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d It was a whisper. \u201cOnly you.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t surprised to feel her inside him, inside his very heart. Of course that was where she\u2019d be\u2014it was the only way to make sure he could protect her. Lara was one of the most vulnerable people he had ever met. She had the capability to face down even Hawke if she thought the alpha was causing himself harm, but by that same token, she\u2019d cut out her own heart and give it to him if it would keep him going. Walker wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d survived this long without someone to watch out for her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWalker . . . did we just . . .\u201d Shocked words, rapid breaths.</p><p>Chapter 54</p><p>HE MOVED UP the bed to rise over her. \u201cLara?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have sex first, talk later.\u201d He might\u2019ve been Silent once, but that man was long gone. The one who remained was holding on to his control by the skin of his teeth.</p><p>Hands on his chest, shaping and petting. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>When he reached down to caress the slick heat between her thighs, she grabbed his wrist. \u201cLet\u2019s skip the foreplay this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Spreading her thighs, he stroked into her, going slow because she seemed too tiny to take him. The heat of her was a sensual jolt that threatened to wrench the reins from his grasp. He\u2019d thought about sinking into her tight grasp, thought about exploring this beautiful body with its soft curves, but never had he realized the savage impact of this act.</p> <p>Mine. It was a primitive thought.</p><p>Right then, she locked her legs around him and thrust her body up at the same time.</p><p>Lara cried out as the aggressive heat of Walker slammed home inside of her, clutching at his back in a vain effort to find an anchor. Her mind was awash in shock and wonder, her body buzzed. She parted her lips to speak, found the words stolen by a demanding male mouth that set her free only long enough to ask, \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo good.\u201d She bit at his jaw, and he reacted the way he always did when she did that.</p><p>He took over her mouth, licking and tasting and demanding . . . while moving in her, slow and deep, one callused hand on her hip to pin her in place. Having hungered for this most intimate of skin privileges for so very long, she met him kiss for kiss, touch for touch, but it was crystal clear she\u2019d never be the dominant in bed.</p><p>Her wolf had no argument with that. She was a healer. She needed a mate who was strong, able to care for her as she cared for others. Kissing at his neck as he reached down to cup her buttocks, to angle her for a deeper penetration, she felt her entire body clench. \u201cWalker! Please.\u201d</p> <p>His next strokes were hard and fast and possessive, his kisses the same. Pleasure rippled over her in waves and then crashed, breaking her into a thousand splinters. She held him to the end. Never was she letting this man and his heart go. Never.</p><p>IT was after the third round of sex\u2014yes, she was sore, and no, she didn\u2019t give a damn\u2014that Lara worked off enough energy that her brain started to function on any level other than the sensual. Snuggling close to Walker, who lay on his side beside her, stroking her curves with those delicious hands, she kissed his chest, licking up the salt-laced taste of dark water and snow-dusted firs.</p><p>Her wolf snuggled up next to him, too, bathing itself in the radiance of the mating bond. It was strong and steady, just like the man who was her mate. \u201cYou know this is for life, right?\u201d she asked, half afraid he\u2019d want to back off now that the buzz was gone.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He stroked his hand over her butt. \u201cThe mating bond will make it easier to keep an eye on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalker.\u201d</p><p>He switched positions so he leaned over her. \u201cLara.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she knew she was going to have trouble with him\u2014but damn if she wasn\u2019t looking forward to it. \u201cCan you see us in the web?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d A satisfied smile. \u201cIt\u2019s rearranged itself so you\u2019re by me. Where I can shield you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never knew you were this possessive.\u201d</p><p>Her answer was a slow, hot kiss that had her rubbing herself against his thigh. Before he could take over, she pushed him to his back and rose to straddle him. Those distinctive green eyes lingered on the modest swell of her breasts with such carnal intent, her toes curled. When he reached up to touch her, explore her, he did so with such intense focus she felt as if she was the most intriguing thing he had ever seen.</p><p>He pinched her nipple in precisely the way she\u2019d whispered she enjoyed that sultry night in her apartment. \u201cLara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d It was a trembling question.</p><p>\u201cTeach me more of the foreplay you like.\u201d</p><p>She was a changeling, sensuality in her blood\u2014and yet his blunt request had her breathless. \u201cI like everything you do to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case\u201d\u2014he flipped her onto her back again, spread her thighs\u2014\u201cI think we should explore the concept of oral sex.\u201d</p><p>Her brain hazed over. And stayed hazed.</p><p>Because once Walker Lauren put his mind to something, it didn\u2019t budge\u2014and the man did not leave any task unfinished. \u201cHmm,\u201d he said after the orgasm left her a quivering mass of female flesh. \u201cLet\u2019s do that again now that I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>Now that he\u2014 \u201cTouch me and die.\u201d Grabbing those big shoulders, she hauled him up.</p><p>\u201cNo more oral sex?\u201d A quiet, sexy smile she knew only she would ever see.</p><p>Her entire body melted. \u201cOh, no. Yes, to more oral sex.\u201d Pushing him onto his back, she slid down his body.</p><p>Her mate, she learned, knew some very interesting words.</p><p>JUDD had gone to Xavier\u2019s to pass over a data crystal encoded with information relating to a woman his friend had been searching for, for years, but as he waited for Xavier to finish speaking to someone in his office and come on out, he found a black-garbed male taking a seat on the moonlit back steps next to him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t surprised\u2014he\u2019d expected this from the instant his family\u2019s cover had been blown. \u201cHello, Aden.\u201d</p><p>Aden looked out at the kitchen garden behind the church. \u201cI did not expect to find you so near a place of worship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you come to kill me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose are my orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I can teleport, that means Vasic is nearby.\u201d</p><p>Aden looked at him for the first time; that face with its high cheekbones, olive skin, and uptilted eyes was that of the quintessential Arrow. Cold. Without any indication of a man behind the mask \u201cVasic was taken off Jax when you were,\u201d he said without warning, referring to the drug that turned Arrows into killers.</p><p>\u201cDid it help him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says there was nothing left in him to save.\u201d</p><p>Judd\u2019s eyes went to the emblem on the shoulder of Aden\u2019s uniform, a single star. \u201cKaleb didn\u2019t give the order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMing.\u201d Aden turned back to look at the garden. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand us, never has, though he once wore the badge of an Arrow.\u201d</p><p>Judd leaned forward to brace his arms on his knees. \u201cI broke the code. I left the squad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo save an X.\u201d Aden echoed his move, unusual from a Silent Arrow.</p><p>\u201cSilence was meant to save the Xs, save all of us who don\u2019t fit into the normal world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s failed, Aden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. For some at least.\u201d A long pause. \u201cThe Council no longer exists, though the populace doesn\u2019t yet realize it. The factions are already forming behind the scenes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a civil war.\u201d One that would devastate the Net.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s been inevitable since the instant our race chose Silence.\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019ll be a small lull as each faction gathers support . . . months, Judd, not years.\u201d</p><p>Bells rang somewhere in the distance, and they both went quiet.</p><p>\u201cHas Walker ever told you he had me as a student?\u201d Aden asked after the echoes faded.</p><p>Judd shook his head. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t speak about his time in the squad\u2019s schoolroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat he taught me . . . tell him it has saved the life and sanity of more than one Arrow.\u201d</p><p>Judd thought of his brother\u2019s brilliance at telepathic deceptions, without which they would\u2019ve never have escaped the Net, and wondered just how Aden had utilized those skills. \u201cIf you need me, I\u2019ll stand beside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou exist. Sienna exists. It\u2019s enough. You not only survived, you\u2019ve found happiness. I don\u2019t understand the emotion, but I know it\u2019s better than the dark. So do the others.\u201d</p><p>Hope, Judd thought. That was the word Aden couldn\u2019t find. \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence is falling.\u201d No change in the tone of his voice, nothing to betray the scale of what he was talking about. \u201cWe will watch, wait, and fight the war when it comes.\u201d</p><p>Judd didn\u2019t ask on which side Aden and the Arrows would stand. He knew.</p><p>DIZZIED by the turn of events that had left her with decades, maybe a century left to live, Sienna was more than grateful when Hawke took her to the privacy of their cabin. She found herself being kissed an instant later. She wanted to nip at those firm lips, even knowing it would be a very bad idea. Might just get her devoured. \u201cWait, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo talking,\u201d he said, a bare millimeter between them. \u201cSkin privileges first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk first.\u201d She dug her nails into his chest.</p><p>Picking her up, he pinned her to the wall, her legs around his waist. \u201cOkay.\u201d Clever hands opening the buttons of her shirt, a sexy mouth on the skin of her throat and the upper curves of her breasts.</p><p>\u201cHawke.\u201d It was a moan, her fingers in his hair.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need these, do you?\u201d Her jeans and panties were torn into fragments moments later, his hand cupping her with heated possessiveness as he kissed the life out of her.</p><p>\u201cOff.\u201d She pulled at the sides of his shirt, heard a button ping to the floor.</p><p>He refused to help her, more interested in playing with her slick flesh, in teasing and tormenting the breasts he\u2019d bared by cutting her bra with a claw. But Sienna had claws of her own. Putting her lips to his ear, she said, \u201cI want to rub my breasts against your chest.\u201d</p><p>She was on her back on the bed with breathtaking speed, a naked Hawke above her moments later. He snapped his teeth at her. Laughing, she did the same. And then she pulled him down and did exactly as she\u2019d demanded.</p><p>Her wolf let her play, played with her, and it wasn\u2019t until they were lying on the rug in front of the fireplace\u2014Hawke dressed in a pair of jeans barely buttoned, her in his shirt\u2014nibbling at a tray of food that Sienna plucked out the key she wore around her neck. \u201cWhat does this open?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rolling to his feet, he went out to the vehicle to return with a small metal box that he placed beside her before resuming his previous position. Knowing the wolf wouldn\u2019t give her a clue, she slid in the key and unlocked the box. Lined with blue velvet, it was empty.</p><p>Strange how she understood. \u201cFor the memories we\u2019ll make.\u201d Her throat grew thick, and though she knew there was a chance his answer would break her heart, she had to ask the question she hadn\u2019t dared to until this moment. \u201cHow did we mate?\u201d Had the events on the battlefield pushed him into it? Did he regret it? She couldn\u2019t speak those fears aloud, but they lived in her heart, bleak and painful.</p><p>HAWKE glanced up at Sienna and knew that he held the balance of power, that what he said next would affect the remainder of their life together in the most profound of ways. He could answer her question without giving anything away, without tilting that balance. Or he could make another choice, one that took them beyond lovers, beyond mates, and to a true alpha pair.</p> <p>\u201cYou were right,\u201d he said and saw a storm of emotion in those extraordinary cardinal eyes.</p><p>It would\u2019ve been easy for her to smile, to accept the admission at face value, but that wasn\u2019t who Sienna was. \u201cAbout what?\u201d she asked, watching him with an expression that had turned a little guarded.</p><p>His wolf wasn\u2019t surprised. Sienna had her own scars, and it would take time for those to fade. Hawke was okay with that\u2014because he was planning to be there for the long haul, ready to battle any nightmare that dared touch her. \u201cAbout the mating bond.\u201d Rising up into a sitting position, he braced one elbow over a drawn up knee. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the wolf holding me back.</p><p>\u201cWhen Rissa died,\u201d he said, giving Sienna this last secret corner of his heart, \u201cit was like having a part of me ripped out. I didn\u2019t speak for a month, didn\u2019t do anything but sit by her grave.\u201d Boy and wolf, they\u2019d both kept hoping that if he wished hard enough, Rissa would come back. \u201cIt took me a long time to accept that she was gone, that the only thing I had of her was the hole she\u2019d left inside me.\u201d</p><p>Sienna moved close enough to curve her hand around the calf of the leg he\u2019d raised, her eyes inky black. But she didn\u2019t interrupt, this woman who understood him in ways he wasn\u2019t sure he understood himself, who\u2019d forced him to face the cold, hard truth of the lies he\u2019d told himself over the years. That didn\u2019t make it any simpler to rip the scab off this wound\u2014hell, he was alpha for a reason. Vulnerability wasn\u2019t a sensation he enjoyed.</p> <p>It made his next words rough, almost harsh. \u201cIt was easier to believe that my shot at mating died with Rissa than to risk that kind of pain again.\u201d Thrusting his hand into her hair, he shook his head. \u201cExcept I never had a prayer when it came to you. You\u2019re in my every breath and every thought, intertwined so deep inside me that love\u2019s not a strong enough word\u2014you have my devotion, your name branded on my soul, my wolf yours to command. A hundred years? It\u2019ll never be enough. I want eternity.\u201d</p><p>Tears, slow and quiet, ran down Sienna\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t finished. \u201cYou have the power to tear me to pieces, to wound me so deep and true that I\u2019ll never recover. What Rissa\u2019s death did to the boy I was? You have the ability to do a thousand times worse to the man I\u2019ve become. Some part of me knew that was a possibility from the instant you walked into my life\u2014so I tried to keep you at arm\u2019s length even as I demanded everything you had. I was a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHawke, no.\u201d On her knees in front of him, she shook her head in open distress, wiping away her tears with the backs of her hands. \u201cI should\u2019ve never said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me on my bullshit,\u201d he said, raising his other knee and bringing her in between. \u201cMade me mad as fucking hell, and it\u2019ll probably do the same in the future when you do it again. Fair warning.\u201d</p><p>Her lips lifting up at the corners in a shaky smile, she twined her arms around his neck. \u201cYou mean you\u2019re not going to become tame and well-behaved now that we\u2019re mated?\u201d Tiny kisses on the corners of his lips, on his cheeks, on his jaw. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p> <p>Leaning into the affection, he allowed her to soothe the sharp edges within. \u201cI can pretend if you want.\u201d He petted the sweet curve of her behind, naked beneath the tails of the shirt she\u2019d commandeered.</p><p>A husky laugh. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know you.\u201d Her next words were solemn, her expression intent. \u201cI know we had an agreement about no alpha stuff between us while we were courting. But that\u2019s going to change. I accept my rank, and I\u2019ll continue to take orders from those who are more senior. But never you.\u201d</p><p>She continued to speak before he could interrupt, her hands moving to cup his face. \u201cI\u2019m yours. No limits. I\u2019ll give you everything you ask, anything you want, except this one thing\u2014obedience because of rank. You will never be my alpha. Not in public, not in private. You\u2019re Hawke to me. Just Hawke. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>His wolf shuddered, relaxed as he bent to touch his forehead to hers. \u201cUnderstood and accepted.\u201d Mine, he thought, mine. For the first time in his adult life, he had someone who was his\u2014and with whom he could engage in a way he couldn\u2019t with any other member of his beloved pack.</p><p>They sat like that for a long time, his wolf peaceful on a level it hadn\u2019t been since he\u2019d picked up the mantle of leadership at fifteen. And that wolf, it wanted her touch, too. He shifted without telling her, heard her gasp. But when the wolf laid its head in her lap and closed its eyes, her fingers clenched, soft and possessive in his fur. Content, he slept.</p><p>SIENNA sat stroking the silver-gold pelt of the huge wolf who slept with his head in her lap, her heart filled with a depth of wonder and joy she couldn\u2019t comprehend. The words he\u2019d given her, the power he\u2019d given her . . . she hadn\u2019t expected either.</p><p>I love you beyond life. It was a thought sent down the mating bond, and when the wolf seemed to sigh, it was clear some part of him heard her. That bond was so deep, so visceral, she knew there would never be another for either of them if one died. The changelings were right\u2014mating was only once and forever.</p><p>A silent tear touched her cheek . . . a tear for Rissa. If Hawke ever wanted to visit the girl who had held his heart as a boy, Sienna wouldn\u2019t stop him. Rissa\u2019s ghost had been laid to rest\u2014what remained were memories that should be cherished and held close. In a way, she thought, Rissa belonged to both of them now, as did her mother, Kristine. Pieces of the past that had shaped them, made them, brought them to this moment.</p> <p>A moment in which she caressed a wolf who\u2019d held together a broken pack through sheer grit and determination. It wouldn\u2019t be a simple or easy life, she thought, her lips beginning to curve. He\u2019d try to dominate her, of that she had not a single doubt. But he would also love her with every powerful beat of that wild changeling heart.</p><p>. . . you have my devotion, your name branded on my soul, my wolf yours to command. A hundred years? It\u2019ll never be enough. I want eternity.</p><p>No, not simple or easy.</p><p>Vivid and dangerous and extraordinary, that\u2019s the life she\u2019d have with her wolf.</p><p>When that wolf raised his head, she smiled. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>He shifted, and suddenly, she was being kissed by a naked man who scrambled her brains. Gasping in a breath as he scooped her up in his arms to throw her playfully onto the bed, she laughed. \u201cIs the edge off yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me again in a month or so.\u201d Then he pounced.</p><p>It was a long time later, her skin shimmering with aftershocks of pleasure, that she frowned and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s your full name?\u201d</p><p>Hawke\u2019s wolf flashed in his eyes, the ice blue glittering with the same amusement that had his cheeks creasing. \u201cWhat brought that on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI refuse to be your mate and be in the dark.\u201d She stroked her palms up over the temptation of his chest, her breasts tingling at the memory of how hard and beautiful he felt pressed up against her. In spite of his earlier words, he\u2019d let her play with his body, stroke the rigid heat of his cock, learn him with her mouth.</p><p>Of course, that hadn\u2019t lasted long. When she\u2019d complained, he\u2019d promised to let her use the handcuffs on him next time. Sienna couldn\u2019t wait to hold him to that promise, to taste every muscled inch of him, but first things first. \u201cTell.\u201d</p><p>Leaning down, he nipped at her jaw, a quick, affectionate bite that had her jerking. \u201cNo distracting me,\u201d she complained, rubbing her foot over the back of his calf, the hairs on his legs crisp and rough, a sexy caress against her skin. \u201cI want to know.\u201d</p><p>His chuckle vibrated through the palms she had on that resilient flesh. \u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d Another small bite before he whispered it in her ear.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He growled, but it was playful. \u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, you know it is.\u201d Perfect for him. \u201cBut then I have to ask about your first name. It doesn\u2019t seem very wolfish\u2014especially considering the age and significance of your last. Was it a family name?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cMy mother had decided on a name if she ever had a boy, long before she met my father, regardless of the fact that Hawke wasn\u2019t any kind of a name for a wolf.\u201d He settled over her, a heavy male blanket. \u201cWhen they mated, she decided to take her mate\u2019s surname, which was one of the oldest, if not the oldest, in the pack, but she refused to change her mind about her son\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>Sienna heard the echo of deepest love in that statement. \u201cYour father accepted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe adored her.\u201d A simple answer. \u201cPlus he figured any son of his would soon handle anyone who hassled him over his name\u2014he was right.\u201d The arrogance was pure male wolf.</p><p>Charmed, she kissed a line up his neck. \u201cIn your mother\u2019s defense,\u201d she said, unable to stop petting him, \u201cit\u2019s a gorgeous, unique name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust not meant for a wolf.\u201d He bent into her caresses. \u201cHonestly? I like that they both gave me a name.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>She did, too. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo I take your last name since we\u2019re mated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d A tilt of his head, the wolf watchful but not demanding.</p><p>She considered the question with care, thinking of who she\u2019d been, who she was now. \u201cYes,\u201d she said at last, \u201cbut I\u2019d like to keep mine, too.\u201d As with Hawke, the past was gone, but it had left an indelible mark, could not be forgotten. \u201cIt\u2019s a part of me.\u201d</p><p>Lips against her own, a wolf\u2019s kiss. \u201cThat works fine for me . . .
