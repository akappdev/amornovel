I\u2019m sitting across from Sophia Sottero. She\u2019s an amazing wedding photographer for the affluent families of New York. In a nutshell, she is everything I want to be, and meeting her in the flesh is so overwhelming I can barely contain myself. I try not to squirm in my seat as her gaze slides over my resume.</p> <p>Sophia is in her early forties with jet-black hair that is smoothed into a neat chignon at the base of her neck. A slender, black suit showcases her figure perfectly and makes her look regal at the same time. I hold my hands in my lap, trying hard not to fidget. The smile that lines my lips is making my face hurt, but I can\u2019t stop. A tiny voice inside my mind squeals with excitement.</p><p>Sophia glances up at me, \u201cTell me, Miss Lamore, why do you want to work at Sottero?\u201d</p><p>Beaming, I reply, \u201cSottero is the most prestigious photography studio in New York City. The style your shooters attain is breathtaking.\u201d My hand clutches my racing heart. It\u2019s true. And with every fiber of my being I want to learn what she knows. \u201cEverything about your studio makes me want to be a part of it. It\u2019s not only the soaring reputation, but also what you do for each and every bride who comes here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make them feel like the most beautiful woman alive. For that entire day, each bride knows she\u2019s flawless. You don\u2019t just give them photographs, Ms. Sottero, you capture their dreams and freeze them in time. It takes heart and skill to do something like that, which is why I would love to have my internship here.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia\u2019s gaze lowers to my resume as I\u2019m speaking. When I\u2019m done talking, her dark eyes lift to meet mine, \u201cMay I ask where else you applied?\u201d</p><p>Normally I would figure out a way to dodge that question, but I want this job so much. I smile calmly and tell the truth, \u201cCouture and Le Femme.\u201d</p><p>A dark brow lifts when I say Le Femme. She places my papers on her desk and leans forward, \u201cLe Femme? Really? What on earth made you apply there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe University requires a minimum of three interviews, and we are supposed to diversify the positions we are looking at. They think it gives us a better footing post-graduation.\u201d I practiced this response before I came. Anyone who finds out that I have an interview at Le Femme won\u2019t take me seriously. It\u2019s a blight on a pristine resume and an excellent grade point average.</p><p>Sophia tilts her head, like that is the most ridiculous thing she\u2019s ever heard. She points a perfectly manicured nail on the shiny desktop. \u201cListen, Anna. Let me do you a favor. I realize the kind of hoops you have to jump through to get your diploma, and the interview at Le Femme is just a waste of time. Cole Stevens is blight on the industry. His work is trash, and any aspiring young photographer should steer clear of him. I know it\u2019s a necessary evil, so I\u2019ll tell you how to end the interview quick and easy. Go in there and act confident to the point of cocky. Wear something that you should never wear to an interview and they\u2019ll show you the door before you even sit down... Unless?\u201d She lets the question hang in the air.</p><p>\u201cUnless what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnless you want to work for Cole Stevens,\u201d Sophia says with distaste, as she leans back in her chair. Although she\u2019s trying to hide it, Sophia\u2019s become tense since we started talking about Le Femme. I can\u2019t tell if she just hates what the studio does, or if it\u2019s more personal than that. She watches me for a moment, taking in my reaction.</p><p>I visibly shudder when she suggests such a thing. \u201cI have no intention of working for Cole Stevens, Ms. Sottero. That interview is a means to an end. I want the internship here with Sottero. I\u2019ll be the best intern you\u2019ve ever had because I want to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than a dream,\u201d I say leaning forward in my chair. \u201cSottero is the place where dreams and reality collide. And somehow you figured out how to capture those moments in photographs that are too stunning for words. Forgive me for being blunt, Ms. Sottero, but I admire your work, your studio, and everything you stand for. If I was given the opportunity to learn from you I know it would give me a secure footing in a difficult industry.\u201d</p><p>We speak for a little longer. I don\u2019t fumble anything. Sophia appears to genuinely like me. As she walks me out, the older woman shakes my hand and says, \u201cI think you\u2019ll do well here, Miss Lamore. Contact me after your interview with Le Femme and we\u2019ll see what we can work out.\u201d</p><p>A grin spreads across my face. I shake her hand too long and too hard, but I don\u2019t care. My dream job is sitting in the palm of my hand. The only thing left to do is finish up with Le Femme to satisfy the University\u2019s requirements and then I\u2019ll have an internship at Sottero!</p><p>CHAPTER 1</p><p>Sunlight pours through the slats in the blinds, forming narrow bars of light. I blink once, clearing the sleep from my eyes. Nerves don\u2019t slither through my body the way they had yesterday. Today is different. Butterflies don\u2019t erupt in my stomach and threaten to fly out my nose. My tongue isn\u2019t dry and tangled. There is no frantic pounding in my chest. Not today. A slow grin spreads across my face as I stretch. Today is a means to an end.</p> <p>After showering quickly, I slap on the outfit I selected the night before. Without glancing in the mirror, I head into the kitchen. The apartment is quiet. It\u2019s Saturday and Emma is still asleep. At least I thought she was.</p><p>\u201cAnna, what the hell are you wearing?\u201d she asks groggily. My roommate is in the hallway, halfway into the bathroom. She stops and stares at me. A tattered robe clings to her narrow figure. Black hair is frizzed around her face, completely flat on one side. In a few hours, she\u2019ll look like a model. It\u2019s been like that since we started college. Emma is the hot one, and I\u2019m \u201cthe hot girl\u2019s friend.\u201d Emma blinks several times, like her big blue eyes are broken. \u201cDon\u2019t you have an interview?\u201d</p><p>I nod, grabbing an apple from the kitchen counter. As I sling my bag over my shoulder, I grab my keys and head toward the door, \u201cAll part of the plan.\u201d</p><p>She doesn\u2019t have time to respond before I\u2019m out the front door, which is good because I would have lost my nerve. The entire time I\u2019ve known Emma she has never let me escape unquestioned. I know she\u2019ll pelt me with questions as soon as I get home. It makes sense that she\u2019s a mass communication major. When she gets a job as a reporter, I know she\u2019ll be good at it. Questioning people is in her DNA, and my outfit was sure to raise questions.</p><p>Sophia mentioned that she worked with Cole Stevens at one point and divulged some pet-peeves of his that will promptly end my interview. After the third interview is complete, only then can I get hired. University requirements.</p><p>I run down the stairs toward the street. Our apartment is a fourth floor walk-up, standard shoe-box-sized so that no one in their right mind would want to stay any longer than necessary. Emma and I rented it two years ago when we started graduate school.</p><p>Breakfast on the go isn\u2019t a part of my ideal morning. Actually, getting up at the crack of dawn on a Saturday isn\u2019t even sane, but this is the time slot I needed, the one where the interviewer is so tired that she needs to prop her head up with coffee mugs. Besides, who puts business meetings on Saturday morning at 7:00am? That makes this the worst interview time possible.</p><p>It\u2019s just a formality, Anna, I tell myself. The past week has made me a jittery mess. The internship matters. The placements can mean getting a good job after college, and I need to be the best in my field to get anywhere in this field. Choosing the arts was insane enough, but being a photographer was even crazier. Everyone and their dog own a camera and claim to be awesome. Botching the internships could mean I\u2019ll have to be some schlep trying to find work on Craig\u2019s List, and I have sworn that won\u2019t be me. Photography is art and I\u2019m an artist.</p><p>Ambition got me this far. The rest of was guts.</p><p>My position with Sottero is cinched. I just have to finish this last task before I can take it. I stare straight ahead as I round the corner and descend underground to the subway. The air smells like burnt pretzels and blows my hair gently. I breathe deeply, relaxed\u2014confident. When I went to my interview with Sophia Sottero, I was a mess. My palms were sweaty and I could barely stand still as the train clunked along the tracks. The same scenario occurred for my interview with Couture. Both are outstanding studios run by women that I admire. I want the internship with Sottero so badly. Couture is my fallback, and Le Femme\u2014I can\u2019t imagine the person who wants an internship at Le Femme. Probably some perv-with-a-camera like the infamous owner, Cole Stevens. Now, that isn\u2019t totally accurate. The man has to have some talent to shoot high-end lingerie on nearly naked models. One of those barely-there panties costs more than my grocery bill. It isn\u2019t my thing, but like I said\u2014three is the magic number and this is my third interview\u2014the one I don\u2019t care about.</p><p>Glancing around, I notice that the subway is relatively empty, which is normal for New York on a Saturday morning. That\u2019s the only bonus to the early interview time\u2014I didn\u2019t have to get up at 5:00am. I switch trains a few times and walk up into the sunlight. Structures of glass and steel tower above my head, but I don\u2019t look up. New Yorkers never look up. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Checking my watch, I hasten my pace. Although I don\u2019t want this job, the University still checks to make sure I apply myself, which means at least showing up on time. I find the building and exit the elevator onto the seventieth floor. A silver plaque hangs on a dark door: LE FEMME STUDIOS.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>I push through the door and step into a quiet office. I stop in my tracks. There is no one here. No receptionist. No employees. Turning, I look around the room slowly. Large portraits of Stevens\u2019 work line the pale blue walls. All the surfaces\u2014the desk and coffee tables\u2014are pale blue glass. A to-die-for view of the Manhattan skyline fills the windows that line one wall. It\u2019s a sight that costs a fortune, a clear status symbol to anyone who walks through the door.</p><p>I step further into the room, \u201cHello?\u201d My voice doesn\u2019t really come out. Why am I whispering? \u201cIs anyone here?\u201d I pad across to the window after looking over my shoulder. Convinced I am alone for the moment, I scan the city far below, and rest my fingers against the pane. \u201cThis must look amazing at night,\u201d I mumble to myself.</p> <p>\u201cIt does.\u201d Startled by the male voice, I jump. My heart ratchets up a notch when I see that Cole Stevens is the one standing behind me, looking over my shoulder. He smiles down at me like my reaction was funny. He is older, close to forty, but you\u2019d never think it by looking at him. Everything from his bone structure to his stance screams model. He has the kind of confidence that comes from a lifetime supply of money, and the designer clothes to match. Dark jeans cling to his narrow hips, topped by a white linen shirt that\u2019s rolled up to his elbows. The top button is undone. Cole\u2019s dark hair has that carefully messy look.</p><p>The man is famous, sexy, powerful\u2014he\u2019s also everything I detest. He spent the last fifteen years of his life making his name, but he did it on the back of his father\u2019s fortune. I pay for college myself. There is a permanent rift between me and people like him, people who have had everything handed to them. That\u2019s part of the reason I don\u2019t want to work for Le Femme. Aspirations of being a wedding photographer for the affluent have been running through my veins for years. The idea of capturing a woman on the most important day of her life appeals to me much more than this fettishography kind of stuff that Cole shoots.</p><p>Cole\u2019s hands are in his pockets, his blue eyes assessing me and my outfit. He seems like he\u2019s been up for hours. He must be a morning person. That would make working with him even worse. People who thrive at 5:00am are freaks. Unlike me, dressed to impress.</p><p>Pressing my lips together, I peel my hand off my blouse and act like I was just brushing off a speck of lint. Confused, I look past him. I thought his assistant was doing the interviews. People like Cole don\u2019t bother with college interns. Shaking off the shock of seeing him in the flesh, I introduce myself. \u201cI\u2019m Anna Lamore. I have an internship interview at seven.\u201d</p><p>He pulls a hand out of his pocket, extending it to me. His shake is confident, his hand warm. \u201cCole Stevens. No one is here this early since its Saturday.\u201d</p> <p>His smile is kind, and it isn\u2019t until now that I really look at his face. There are tiny wrinkles that line the corners of his mouth, like he smiles often. Taking his hand, I shake it and nod. His grip is gentle, but firm. Something about him sets me off kilter. Butterflies erupt in my stomach and I don\u2019t know why. When he ends the handshake, Cole glances at me once more and turns away\u2014gesturing for me to follow. I take in the posh offices as we walk down a long hall.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to Le Femme,\u201d he says. The casual tone of his voice makes me think his head isn\u2019t as big as the media says. \u201cAs you know we are the world\u2019s premiere boudoir studio, predominately shooting lingerie accounts for swank designers. We do everything in-house, from selecting models to make-up and postproduction. Nothing is out-sourced,\u201d he stops and holds open a glass door. His hand flicks on the lights and we sit at a huge wooden conference table. This room has a much warmer feel than the waiting area at the front. Walking past him, I catch his scent. It\u2019s a light clean fragrance. His eyes are on me as I pass, no doubt studying my absurd outfit.</p><p>I slide into a seat and lean back, steepling my fingers like I\u2019m plotting to take over the world and smile at him. Cole tells me more about the company he created as I tap my fingertips together, trying to muster the guts to finish doing the things Sophia suggested so I can put this interview to rest quickly.</p><p>\u201cThe internship is a prestigious position, Miss Lamore. Many students compete to get it, and there is only one position. An internship here gives you access to employment with the company when you\u2019re done. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but you\u2019re at the top of your class.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tap the top of the table as he stops speaking. Cole\u2019s gaze slides over my face, the slouch of my shoulders, and then drifts to my jeans that are rolled up to my knees, showcasing striped rainbow knee-highs. Sparkling yellow Chucks are on my feet. They match the tutu around my waist. His eyebrows creep up his face before he looks back up at me. I\u2019m not certain if he\u2019s questioning the data or stating that he can\u2019t believe it from the sight of me. I should have been dressed in a suit. If I was brave and wanted this internship, I would have worn some fashionable business attire with a snazzy flare. But I\u2019m dressed like a bedazzled circus clown. I had to make sure I don\u2019t have any chance of getting this job, and showing up dressed like this would ensure it even if I did take Sophia\u2019s suggestion a little too far.</p><p>Smiling, I nod, \u201cYeah,\u201d my fingers tap on the table top, strumming like his. He notices the mirrored movement, and his eyes flick to my hand before returning to my face. \u201cI\u2019m the top in my class.\u201d Silence fills the air before Cole finally speaks again. My manners are intentionally horrible. He notices my lack of proper decorum, my utter indifference. It\u2019s screaming through my body language even when I\u2019m not speaking.</p> <p>Cole\u2019s gaze narrows. The look he gives me is irritating. It\u2019s smug, like he knows what I\u2019m up to. Leaning back in his chair, he folds his arms over his chest. For an old guy, he\u2019s pretty chiseled. \u201cLet\u2019s cut to the chase, Miss Lamore. I don\u2019t normally do the intern interviews. Your resume looks the same as a hundred others. Your work demonstrates potential, but it\u2019s nothing phenomenal.\u201d He pauses, taking in my reaction.</p><p>I\u2019m surprised at his candor, but don\u2019t react. I don\u2019t want this job, I remind myself. I have nothing to prove to him. I don\u2019t care if he thinks I suck. I know better. I know Sophia Sottero was excited when she met me. I know I want that internship and not this one.</p><p>Cole leans forward, \u201cThe reason I wanted to meet you, the reason you caught my attention, was because you chose the worst interview time we offer... \u201d He grins at me, and leans back into his chair again. \u201cIt implies that you wanted this position very much.\u201d</p><p>I shrug, folding my arms, mirroring him again, \u201cIt was the only slot left.\u201d The lie slips easily off my tongue.</p><p>\u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he replies, leaning forward, calling me on the lie. There\u2019s a gleam in his eye that wasn\u2019t there before, like hot curiosity igniting a match-tip. His gaze is intense, and I can\u2019t help but squirm when he looks at me like that. \u201cYou were the first person to sign up. So tell me something, Anna, if you would\u2014\u201c he looks down at the ring on his index finger and then back up at me, \u201cwhy did you wake up at the crack of dawn to come to see me? Why do you want to work for Le Femme?\u201d</p><p>His words say one thing, but his tone says something else. It\u2019s a dare, a challenge almost, to continue with my plan. My pulse is racing. I march ahead with my idea, muttering things that Sophia assured would get me tossed out. Ignoring that gaze of his, I lower my eyes and pick at my nail polish while I speak, \u201cWell, Le Femme has been around for a while. I mean, the company itself was formed nearly two decades ago. I mean, you\u2019re not a fly-by-night studio, so that\u2019s appealing. But, you\u2019re not ridiculously old, either.\u201d I flick my nail and a piece of red polish flutters to the carpet. I continue speaking, watching it fall, \u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019ve never seen a digital camera and insist on using an ancient Brownie or something crazy like that.\u201d Immediately, I want to laugh and shirk off the nerves that are spilling down my spine like ice water, but I can\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d he says, smirking at me, his eyes shifting to my fingers as I pick and flick. When the piece of polish lands on the carpet, we look up at the same time. \u201cI\u2019m thirty-eight by the way</p><p>I\u2019m not old, he means, I have a lot I could teach you.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I clear my throat and lean forward. I\u2019m tactless, crass, and rude. Everything he wouldn\u2019t want, yet he is looking at me like there is nothing he wants more. That gleam in his eye tells me that something is off. I redirect, trying to offend him, \u201cLike I said, not that old.\u201d I pat his knee like he\u2019s a geriatric patient who got lost in the mall parking lot and lean closer, speaking a little too loudly, \u201cI know things are changing fast and that\u2019s why interns are good\u2014they\u2019re young and can help older people in our industry with shifting trends.\u201d I wink at him and lean back in my seat. My heart is pounding in my chest. It\u2019s the most brazen thing I\u2019ve ever said to someone\u2019s face. I slammed his age, ability, and company in one breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d his expression is hard to read. Leaning back, he steeples his fingers and taps them one at a time, his eyes never leaving mine. The room fades away and the only thing I can see are his eyes, dark as sapphires, and glinting like he\u2019s amused\u2014or pissed\u2014I can\u2019t tell which one. Damn it. Why does he hide his reactions so well? It\u2019s obvious that I don\u2019t belong here, and yet, he\u2019s still talking to me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, of course.\u201d I shrug and lean back, draping my arm over the back of the chair. In the back of my mind I\u2019m thinking that he should have ended this already and shown me the door, but he prods me to talk. And the more I talk, the more insane I sound. Pretentious brat doesn\u2019t even come close to some of the trash coming out of my mouth.</p><p>\u201cComing here would be a risk for me though,\u201d I say. \u201cPeople say you\u2019re losing your edge\u2014that it\u2019s only a matter of time before Le Femme is replaced by someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you think?\u201d he taps his index fingers together once and waits for me to answer.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been flying by the seat of my pants, making up passive-aggressive insults for over twenty minutes. I decide to give him the shove he needs to show me the door. Glancing at my arm draped over the back of the chair, I pause and then look back up into his face. Maintaining a calm exterior is getting harder and harder. I\u2019m lying, blurting out anything I can think of to get him to dismiss me as some arrogant twit.</p><p>Looking him square in the face, I answer, \u201cI think you\u2019re already past your prime. I mean, come on. Let\u2019s be honest. Your work\u2019s been slipping for years.\u201d I feel bad saying such a thing. I may not like his subject-matter, but Cole is a good photographer. Saying anything else is a lie, but I need to get him to show me the door and he hasn\u2019t.</p><p>When I finish, no one speaks. His expression is neutral even as I verbally bitch-slapped his company, and then him personally. It\u2019s clear that I think he\u2019s a has-been. At least I think it\u2019s clear. Cole just stares at me from behind his palms, occasionally tapping his pointer fingers together.</p><p>I stare back.</p><p>We watch each other in silence for a few moments. When Cole speaks, he\u2019s looking at the table. Suddenly he moves and pulls a cell out of his pocket and rests it in front of him. The light stubble on his cheeks is distracting me a little. He is easy on the eyes, even if he is nearly twice my age.</p> <p>Cole\u2019s voice is deep and rich, \u201cYou know what I think?\u201d He glances up at me from beneath his brow. He takes his phone and taps it on the table, then continues, \u201cI think that you\u2019re trying to blow this interview\u2014that you don\u2019t want this job.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>I start to say something, but Cole talks over me. Holding up his hand to silence me, he says, \u201cAnd for the life of me, I can\u2019t understand why. What would make you so incredibly cocky that you would walk in here and tell me to my face that I\u2019m just another old man with a camera?\u201d He\u2019s grinning at me now, like he knows something I don\u2019t. He taps the phone again.</p><p>Before I realize I\u2019m doing it, I\u2019m wringing my hands, my gaze lingering on his cell. I have no idea how he figured that out. Arrogant and crazy must look the same in his brain. I didn\u2019t tip my hand. I didn\u2019t blow my cover. At least I don\u2019t think I did, but I\u2019m a big girl. I can admit it when I\u2019m busted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I say, utterly embarrassed. I can\u2019t look at him. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to waste your time,\u201d I say softly. I start to stand, but he leans forward, stopping me. I feel the light touch of his hand on my wrist.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he says. I look up at him and our eyes lock. My stomach tingles at his touch before he slides his fingers away. There\u2019s a slight pause before he leans back, saying, \u201cTell me where else you applied and why you want to work there more.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d I blink at him, thinking I\u2019ve already wasted enough of his time.</p><p>He nods, \u201cYes. If you have no desire to work here, then I\u2019m obviously doing something wrong.\u201d He tilts his head back, the corners of his lips seem like they want to pull into a smile, but they don\u2019t.</p><p>Since I don\u2019t see the harm, I sit back down. Hesitantly, I say, \u201cI applied at Sottero, Couture, and here. I thought they\u2019d be better suited to teaching me what I want to pursue. Both are wedding photographers. The University requires diversification during the interview process. This was my third interview.\u201d He nods as I speak, his eyes flicking up from the table to my face as he tilts his head and leans back listening to why I didn\u2019t chose Le Femme. \u201cBoth Sottero and Couture are self-made. They pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and became two of the best studios in Manhattan and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth are women,\u201d he interrupts. He says it like it\u2019s a bad thing.</p><p>My brows pinch together. I\u2019m not sure where he\u2019s going with this\u2014if he wants to help me or if this is payback for wasting his time. Cole Stevens makes me uneasy. I nod my head slowly, replying, \u201cExactly. And I think that\u2019s an asset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to you,\u201d he says, shaking his head. \u201cYou said on your resume that you wanted to be a wedding photographer for the rich,\u201d he lifts the paper and looks at it, before looking back up at me, \u201cWas that true or did you lie about everything?\u201d</p><p>My cheeks flame and I squirm in my seat. Regret washes over me. I wish I didn\u2019t listen to Sophia. I should have come in and said what I usually say and leave. Instead I\u2019m sitting here with my stomaching twisting and doing my best not to wring my fingers and dive under the table. Mortification doesn\u2019t look good on me.</p><p>I press my lips together and look up at him. At least I try to. I feel foolish for getting caught. My voice is soft and steady, \u201cI didn\u2019t lie. My resume is real. My accomplishments are true. I just felt like I\u2019d do better somewhere that was more...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMore like what you already do. Anna,\u201d he pushes away my resume and looks straight at me, \u201cinternships are to learn. While you might admire Sophia Sottero, her work is lacking. She\u2019s a single medium artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Couture? You think her studio is substandard, too?\u201d I ask calmly. Those two studios are owned by women in a man\u2019s industry. I respect them with every fiber of my being. They made something from nothing. They do exactly what I want to do. And this guy is slamming them. Tension lines my arms and trickles down my spine. People like Cole Stevens have no idea how hard it is to go it alone. Everything was handed to him.</p><p>I smile, shaking my head softly, and say what I\u2019m thinking, \u201cHow can you be so arrogant? How can you dismiss them so quickly? Their work is beautiful.\u201d He starts to answer, but I talk over him, \u201cThat is what I want to do\u2014and Couture or Sottero can offer me the training I need to accomplish that dream. I want to show women what they look like on the most important day of their lives. I want them to see how stunning they really are.\u201d My face pinches together, \u201cI don\u2019t want to learn how to turn them into a wet dream.\u201d</p><p>He laughs, one short laugh, \u201cYou think that\u2019s what I do? Make fantasy girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I say. I don\u2019t know where this streak of confidence is coming from, but he thought he was right and he isn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t understand and I want him to. \u201cYou don\u2019t get what I want to do. Women are more than some fantasy. They have brains, and hearts, and bodies that they never think are good enough. I want to show them they are good enough, just the way they are. I want beauty to be defined by the woman, not society. I want a woman to feel powerful and beautiful when she looks at a shot I\u2019ve taken. It\u2019s art, Mr. Stevens.</p><p>\u201cWork like yours blindsides everything I want to do\u2014everything I want to be. It\u2019s not about heart with you, it\u2019s about seeing how far can you push the line and still be able to shoot your ads to turn a profit.\u201d I\u2019m practically breathless when I suddenly stop speaking. My jaw dangles open, and I\u2019m shocked that I\u2019ve spoken to him like that. Everything that I hold against him came pouring out of my mouth. I sit frozen and pull my jaw shut.</p><p>Cole\u2019s glaring at me now. His eyes flick to his phone. Before I know what\u2019s happening, he flips it on and the screen flares to life. He presses a number and says to me, \u201cThis has been a very informative meeting. I had no idea feminists hate me so much,\u201d he says playfully.</p><p>I smile and say, \u201cYes, you did.\u201d Leaning back into my chair, I fold my arms across my chest. I have no idea what made me say it. I meant to be playful, but it came out wrong, \u201cYou just didn\u2019t know regular women don\u2019t like you, either.\u201d For a hideous moment, I can feel a flirtatious smile slip across my lips. Cole stops whatever call he\u2019s about to make and stares at me. God, his eyes are so blue.</p><p>He blinks once, hard, like he can\u2019t believe I just said that. Neither can I. What the hell is wrong with me?</p><p>After a moment, he says, \u201cActually, you\u2019re one of the only applicants who spoke frankly with me this week. I may not have conducted their interviews, but I did speak to each of them briefly. It\u2019s been a blinding array of endless flattery. Your apparent distaste is refreshing.\u201d I smirk at him, but don\u2019t reply. I don\u2019t trust my mouth anymore. My head is spinning and there is nothing I want more than to get out of there. Cole\u2019s eyes drift over me, lowering to my shoulders and quickly sweeping to my shoes before he looks me in the eye and asks, \u201cSo, tell me. The clothes\u2014do you usually dress like that? Or was that just for me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A lopsided grin spreads across my lips. My voice is soft, and I can\u2019t look at him when I say it. In hindsight, listening to Sophia was definitely a mistake.</p><p>\u201cNo, the deranged clown look was just for you. It\u2019ll give you something to talk about for a while...\u201d my voice trails off. Cole doesn\u2019t seem amused. I feel bad and stand to leave, holding out my hand. The phone is next to his ear and I can tell he\u2019s on hold. \u201cNo hard feelings, I hope.\u201d</p><p>Cole stands, presses the phone to his ear with his shoulder, and takes hold of my hand, \u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>A smile lights up his face. I glance at our hands. He hasn\u2019t released me. Something feels strange, surreal, like this moment matters more than any other. His pink lips are parted slightly, and Cole breathes slowly, gazing into my eyes. I pull away, and my hand slips from between his fingers. A shiver runs through my shoulders and into my chest, stealing my breath.</p> <p>Cole watches me, like he\u2019s completely aware of my reaction to his touch. His eyes pin me in place. For that moment, I don\u2019t want to move...I don\u2019t want to breathe. I don\u2019t know what I want, but something is pulling inside of me, demanding that I don\u2019t walk away from this man. Cole stands close enough to me that I can feel his breath on my cheek. When I drop his hand, he steps toward me. Every inch of my body reacts.</p><p>A voice rings in his ear breaking the moment. Startled by the draw to Cole Stevens, I ignore whatever happened. I don\u2019t even want to think about it. Goosebumps cover my skin and I rub my hands over my arms quickly to smooth them down.</p><p>Nodding at Cole, I turn and start walking toward the door, taking it as a sign that I\u2019ve been dismissed and that there are hard feelings. Damn. I didn\u2019t want that. As I lift my hand to the knob, I look over my shoulder. Cole doesn\u2019t look at me. He doesn\u2019t say good-bye. Inwardly, I cringe. This is one of the biggest mistakes I\u2019ve made. I can feel it and yet I have no idea what kind of impact this one event will have on my life. I twist the knob and pull the door open.</p><p>Talking to the person on the phone, Cole says, \u201cFinally. What were you, sleeping? Yeah, well, I\u2019ve been here chatting with Anna Lamore.\u201d</p><p>My eyes go wide and I nearly trip over my sparkling feet as I come to a stop, and look back at his broad shoulders. He turned away from me, but I can see the grin on his face when he turns his head. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I whisper, panicked, and walk in front of him. An insane thought crosses my mind\u2014I could jump on his back and take the phone\u2014but I can\u2019t. Whatever he\u2019s doing is already done. He already said my name, told someone I was here. My stomach sinks and my hands shake. This feels bad. Whatever he\u2019s doing throws me into a full blown anxiety attack.</p> <p>Cole covers the phone with his hand, \u201cTalking to your dean.\u201d He uncovers the phone, \u201cYes, she is.\u201d</p><p>Terror courses through me as my eyes go wide. If he tells the dean what I did, the university will be pissed. Attending this interview and making sure Cole didn\u2019t want me still counted as an interview, right?</p><p>A thought takes hold and makes me feel sick\u2014this could mess up my chances with Sottero.</p><p>For a moment, I wonder if Sophia did this to me on purpose. It could have been a cruel trick on her part, but for the life of me I can\u2019t see why. If she intended on offering me the internship, why would she encourage me to do something to Cole that would warrant this kind of reaction? She knew him. They worked together. She told me these things, the clothes, the kid in need of a serious attitude adjustment, would make his people show me the door faster than I could blink. Instead, Cole grabbed the phone and called my dean.</p><p>My stomach twists when his eyes lock with mine. A mischievous grin spreads across Cole\u2019s lips, he looks sweet and playful, but I\u2019m too on edge to notice, \u201cShe told me that I\u2019m a washed-up, sexist, has-been and that she has absolutely no intention of working for me. Yeah,\u201d he laughs, \u201cshe really did. So I wanted to make sure that I got hold of you first.\u201d His voice turns serious. The smile fades from his face, \u201cTell Sottero and Couture that they\u2019re too late. I hired Anna this morning.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p> <p>I stand there like I\u2019ve been sucker-punched. My ears are ringing with his words, but I can\u2019t believe Cole did it. For a few moments after he hangs up, I just stare at him wide-eyed. My mind is reeling, trying to determine why he did that.</p><p>I\u2019m near tears. \u201cHow could you?\u201d I gasp, and fold my arms across my body. I fall back into the chair, completely deflated.</p><p>My shot with Sophia Sottero is gone. In one phone call Cole changed my future. Instead of being the elegant wedding photographer to the famous, I am going to be something else, something that will ruin my career before it starts. Shocked, I glare up at him. Cole is leaning against the side of the table. His gaze rests on my face, waiting for me to react. I try to hold everything in check, but I don\u2019t understand. Why did he do that? Rage floods through my tiny body.</p><p>Rising to my feet, I step toward him. My hands are balled into fists at my sides, shaking, \u201cHow could you do that? You had no right!\u201d</p><p>Cole remains relaxed, like he pisses women off all the time, like my temper-tantrum is theatrics, but it isn\u2019t. He folds his arms across his chest, \u201cI did you a favor, Lamore. The last thing the world needs is another wedding photographer\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off, shoving my finger into his chest. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t your decision to make!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell it was,\u201d his eyes are cold, his expression rigid. He grabs my finger and flings my hand away. \u201cWho\u2019s the arrogant ass here, Anna? Who walked in here looking like a side-show act? That was you. Remember?\u201d</p><p>I try to control my temper and force back tears that are building behind my eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing,\u201d I say coolly. \u201cI had no intention of working here. Ever. You know what the University puts us through. You\u2019ve had interns before! Maybe I didn\u2019t approach it right, but I didn\u2019t deserve this. And just because you made one call, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll work here.\u201d Glaring up at him with barely contained fury I continue, \u201cI\u2019ll call Sophia myself and tell her that I\u2019m still on the market\u2014that your claim with the dean was an attempt to steal me away from her.\u201d</p> <p>A cold dark expression crosses his face. His brow rises slightly, and his arms unfold. He leans toward me, making my heart race faster, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that if I were you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a veiled threat?\u201d</p><p>He leans closer to my face, his warm breath flowing across my lips, \u201cNo, it\u2019s a plain old overt threat. If you don\u2019t work here, you won\u2019t work anywhere. New York moves in social circles that you aren\u2019t a part of. One word from me will keep you on the outside.\u201d He pulls away, the tension in his jaw easing slightly.</p><p>Fury rages in my eyes. Every dream I had was just ripped apart. I make a false start and then press my lips together and shake my head. When I steady my voice, I say, \u201cSo this is what I get for screwing with you and wasting your time? This is my punishment for messing with the famous Cole Stevens?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that,\u201d he replies before pushing off the table and standing in front of me. \u201cDon\u2019t screw with things that you can\u2019t control.\u201d The fire in his eyes softens.</p><p>Rage flows through me, engulfing every muscle, every fiber of my body. The floodgates behind my eyes are ready to overflow, but I try to hold them back as I stare him down, shaking. A tear escapes from the corner of my eye and streaks down my cheek. His gaze shifts, watching it fall. Wiping it away with the back of my hand, I steady my voice. It is deep and dangerous, my rage barely in check, \u201cI\u2019ll never forgive you for this.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>Fumbling the dish, it slips between my hands and lands hard on the counter. Emma is here, locked in her room. I try to be quiet. I don\u2019t want her to know I am home. I don\u2019t want to talk about Cole or what he did, or the threat he made. I\u2019d go at him if I could, but I am a nobody. There are no socialites in my circles, no way to do any damage, no way to bend his arm to let me go.</p><p>The dish clangs on the counter. As I reach for it, the noise echoes loudly through the tiny apartment. Every emotion that surged through me that morning comes rushing back. Taking the bowl in my hands, I swing my arm, and send it sailing into the wall. It shatters into a million pieces, shards flying everywhere. Tears sting my eyes, and I finally give in and let them come. Burying my head in my arms, I lay it down on the counter, sobbing.</p><p>The music in Emma\u2019s room shuts off and she opens her door. \u201cAnna?\u201d she asks, hanging her head out. Her eyes drift to the broken dish and then to me. I hate crying. I never cry and I\u2019m near hysterical. \u201cOh my god. What happened?\u201d She rushes toward me, not knowing what\u2019s wrong. \u201cAnna, are you all right? Did you cut your hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d my voice bleats between sobs. Raising my head, I look at her. I\u2019m still wearing my tee shirt and jeans. I\u2019ve taken off the tutu, socks, and sneakers. Tearstains chill my cheeks. \u201cThat dick screwed me. I... I tried to... And he...\u201d</p><p>Emma starts looking me over like she thinks some jerk grabbed me on the subway. \u201cNo, Em! The interview. It was the interview! Cole Stevens screwed me over.\u201d I finally get enough control over myself to tell her what happened. Emma listens to the entire story. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When I finish, she pushes a long lock of dark hair behind my ear, \u201cSo, he was mad? He did this to get back at you for wasting his time? Anna, that doesn\u2019t make any sense. It seems too cruel.\u201d I shoot a look at her, shocked that she doesn\u2019t believe me. She smiles at me, knowing what I\u2019m thinking, \u201cOf course I believe you, but it just seems a bit drastic. You didn\u2019t do something else to him, did you? Something that he\u2019d want payback for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm, think about it,\u201d I lean my head back against the wall, wiping away the tears that soak my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to see him every day for three months. There were better ways to screw with me, right? I don\u2019t understand what happened. One moment everything seemed fine\u2014he was acting like he thought it was funny. Then he had the dean on the phone, and the whole thing fell apart.\u201d I get up, grab the kitchen towel, and run cold water over it, before pressing it to my face.</p><p>Emma leans back against the counter, her dark hair falling over her shoulder when she looks at me. \u201cHe ruined your shot at Sottero?\u201d</p><p>Clutching the damp towel, I nod. \u201cWhat do I do? I have to do the internship to graduate. I need the experience to get a job. And without that internship referral from a prestigious studio, I\u2019m screwed. There\u2019s no way I\u2019ll make it.\u201d My lip starts to quiver again.</p> <p>Emma takes me by the shoulders, and shakes me once. \u201cSnap out of it, Anna. You have to suck this up. Here\u2019s what you do: Hate his guts, do your internship, and then get the hell out of there. You probably won\u2019t even see him. Interns are like Labradors\u2014they fetch crap\u2014and if you\u2019re really good they\u2019ll throw you a bone that\u2019ll look good on your resume. Piss on his pants when he\u2019s not looking, and chew up his shoes. Okay? You can do this. You\u2019ve dealt with worse than this pampered ass. You can do this.\u201d</p><p>Her pep talk floods through me and suddenly I feel really tired. I nod at her, mute. There is nothing left to say. I have to go through with the internship at the slut factory, but I\u2019ll do more than be a nuisance, like Em suggested. I\u2019ll find dirt on Cole Stevens that will destroy him.</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted to intern with Sottero? How\u2019d you do a one-eighty and end up at Le Femme?\u201d Edward holds up his hands and grins, \u201cNot that I blame you. Having a girlfriend who shoots at Le Femme is sexy as hell.\u201d He looks me over like he\u2019s never seen me before and waggles his dark eyebrows.</p><p>I elbow him in the ribs, and he laughs, nearly dropping his popcorn on the movie theatre floor. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s why I did it. So you can fantasize about me shooting half-naked chicks all day.\u201d I reached into my purse, fish out a tissue, and hand it to him. \u201cWipe the drool off your face,\u201d I say holding the tissue out between my fingers. It dangles there between us for a second. I can\u2019t keep my tone serious and I snort by mistake.</p> <p>Edward pushes his hair out of his eyes and slouches back in his seat. His long lean legs are extended in front of him. There\u2019s a soda between us in the cup-holder that\u2019s built into the armrest. I reach over and grab some popcorn. Edward throws a few kernels at me and they get stuck in my hair. I stick my tongue out at him, and he lunges in for a kiss.</p><p>\u201cAwh, gross,\u201d Emma says and looks away. She\u2019s sitting on the other side of me. Although she knows the whole story, she says nothing to Edward. I didn\u2019t want to deal with his temper and if Edward knew what Cole did, well\u2014I just didn\u2019t want to deal with it\u2014so I said I chose to work with Cole.</p><p>Emma says, \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough you have to date my brother, but do you have to suck his face off in front of me too?\u201d Em\u2019s elbow bumps into my ribs and I choke. She effectively removed her brother\u2019s lips from mine.</p><p>He grins at me, and throws popcorn at his twin sister. It sticks to her hair and she shoots him a look.</p><p>\u201cReal mature, Edward.\u201d She picks out the kernels and throws them on the floor.</p><p>We got to the theatre too early. Edward is like that. He wants to be in his seat fifteen minutes before the movie begins. Em and I would have walked in five minutes before, and as long as it wasn\u2019t opening weekend, that works fine. There are only three of us, but Edward is a little bit of a control freak.</p> <p>It\u2019s funny, although I have known him for years, we didn\u2019t get together until a few months ago. I took my one and only business class. It was about marketing. I thought that would come in handy one day when I had my own studio. The class had all business people in it, people who spent their entire undergrad time sitting in classes and absorbing the vernacular. Meanwhile, I was learning about shadows and shading in the art department. From the first class, I felt like I was drowning in a sea of words and concepts that I didn\u2019t understand. Edward sat next to me and helped me figure it out. During midterms, we were studying and it was late. One thing led to another and his lips met mine. Since then, I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about what I want him to do to me with those sexy lips.</p><p>We lean our foreheads together and I smile at him for a second, thinking naughty thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d I whisper so Emma can\u2019t hear. He wraps his arms around my shoulder and I lean my head against him.</p><p>Emma slumps down in her seat and rests her feet on the empty chair in front of her. It\u2019s after ten and the theatre isn\u2019t full. The lights fade and the coming attractions begin. A Le Femme ad is lumped in with some others. Edward and Emma are staring at the screen, no doubt seeing perfection that doesn\u2019t exist. Rage floods through me when I see the ad. Cole\u2019s perception of beauty doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s an ad produced for men, with a product aimed at women. It makes no sense and pisses me off.</p><p>Edward seems to sense the tension building in my shoulders. He mistakes it for something else, \u201cNervous?\u201d he whispers in my ear.</p><p>I shake my head as the ad ends. Monday morning I start an internship that I don\u2019t want, with a man that threatened to destroy my career. Nervous is the wrong word. Enraged is more like it. My mind swims with ideas, ways to get back at Cole for doing this to me. Come the end of summer, he\u2019s going to wish he never met me.</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>My legs are draped over the side of the bed. Edward has his hands on my shoulders, applying gentle pressure, massaging my tension away. The movie was good, but my mind was elsewhere. We came back to the apartment, and quickly ducked behind my bedroom door before Emma could comment on her brother being in my room so late.</p><p>Edward leans closer, his warm breath tickling in my ear, \u201cI had fun tonight.\u201d I smile absently, the hairs on the back of my neck prickle as his breath lingers.</p> <p>We haven\u2019t been together yet. The time never seemed right. Or maybe I just keep putting it off because I\u2019m not sure that I want to have sex with my best-friend\u2019s brother. That is a lifetime of awkward moments if things don\u2019t work out. He\u2019ll be picturing me naked in his mind, doing all the naughty things I like to do\u2014things no one knows about\u2014with that adorable grin on his face every time he sees me. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m up for that.</p><p>Edward\u2019s hands slide along my shoulders, his fingers slipping under my collar, tracing my neck with his fingertips. I close my eyes and shudder at his touch. He\u2019s beautiful and funny, witty and smart. He\u2019s everything that makes my heart race, but I still feel nervous about being with him. He doesn\u2019t pressure me, not really, but he doesn\u2019t stop trying to seduce me either. Eventually, I\u2019ll give in. He knows it and so do I. It\u2019s only a matter of time until I can\u2019t resist him any longer.</p><p>\u201cSo did I,\u201d my voice is weak, like I\u2019ve been sleeping. I clear my throat, trying to bat away the butterflies forming in my stomach.</p><p>As I turn toward him, Edward reaches for my face and pulls us together. His lips are soft and hot. Gently, he kisses me, over and over. The kisses are so soft and sweet that I gasp. My heart is pounding. It feels like my head is spinning and I want nothing more than to feel my body sliding against his. I want to forget this day, escape it\u2014with him.</p><p>I slip my fingers beneath his shirt and trail my hands up his hard stomach. Our kiss deepens as I do so, and he moans softly. I pull him tighter for a moment. His bare skin is scorching under my palms. I want to lose myself in him. I want to stop thinking, stop freaking out over what happened earlier. I was so upset and scared\u2014terrified\u2014that my future had been ripped out of my hands. I never saw it coming.</p><p>Edward\u2019s hand cups my breast, his lips kissing me, making me hotter and hotter. He squeezes me hard and I gasp, wishing he\u2019d do it again. As he lowers me onto my bed, his blue eyes lock on mine. Edward\u2019s hands slide under my shirt and he pulls it over my head before my back hits the comforter. I lay in front of him with my hair splayed around me in long dark curls. I\u2019m wearing a lacy black bra and jeans that sit just below my waist.</p><p>He sits above me, his eyes taking me in like he could never get enough. \u201cYou\u2019re so sexy, Anna,\u201d he says, and lowers himself on top of me. Edward kisses my cheek, then my ear, and starts moving down my neck. The heat of his mouth leaves a hot trail in his wake.</p><p>My body is strung tight\u2014my back arches into his touch\u2014into his kiss. My pulse pounds faster and faster. I\u2019m so hot. The pit of my stomach has no floor. It\u2019s fallen away with his kisses, and the heat between my thighs is completely unbearable. He feels my body shift beneath him, notices my legs opening for him. Edward\u2019s fingers reach for the button my jeans and he slips it through the hole, then lowers the zipper. His hand slides into my pants, slowly pressing into my panties until I feel him hesitate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gasping, I say, \u201cI want you. I want to feel you. Please, Edward. Touch me.\u201d</p><p>He smiles that beautiful smile that I love and his fingers press against the bare skin between my legs. I slide against his hand, my jeans pulling tighter as his hand moves. Edward dips his lips to my breast and he nips me gently, tugging my nipple with his teeth. A moan escapes my lips. I\u2019m burning up inside. I want him. I want to feel him. I want to ride him and be with him.</p><p>His fingers circle the tender flesh between my legs, gently rubbing and stroking until I can\u2019t stand it. The heat flashes through my stomach as I arch my back, begging him to touch me. He slides a finger into me and I moan, pushing back against his hand. Teeth nip my breasts, and his tongue teases me through the lace bra. I gasp, saying his name. With one hand he continues to stroke me, making me wetter and wetter. My body moves against his hand, craving more. His other hand finds the closure on my bra and flicks it open. The lace loosens and he pulls it away. His lips kiss me gently at first and then harder, drawing my tender flesh into his mouth, sucking. Writhing, I come against his hand. He pushes into me hard as he feels me pulsate, his lips still on my breast. Every time his hand pushes into me, I moan.</p><p>Edward kisses me gently and pulls away. He jumps up and walks toward the door, \u201cBe right back.\u201d He grins at me.</p> <p>Breathing deeply I watch him, wondering what he\u2019s doing. I never let him touch me like that before and I didn\u2019t expect him to get me so riled up and then stop. I thought this was foreplay, but he\u2019s left me alone. Sweat is covering my body. The air feels too cold with him gone. When I look up, he\u2019s standing in the doorway with a towel in his hands.</p><p>It takes me a minute. I\u2019m dazed with a lust-induced stupor, but I figure it out and ask, \u201cYou washed your hands?\u201d</p><p>He nods and tosses the towel aside, closing the door behind him. \u201cYeah. Why? Does that bother you? Most girls like that I want to be clean.\u201d</p><p>I arch an eyebrow at him. My pulse is slowing, my senses returning. He just said several things that bothered me, but getting up and leaving me there to wash his hands was the worst. I can\u2019t even process what he just did so I latch onto the obvious, \u201cGirls? How many have you been with?\u201d</p><p>Leaning on the bed, he drapes his arm over my waist, \u201cEnough to know what I like. Enough to know I want you.\u201d His eyes rove over my body like he\u2019s still filled with desire, but the way he washed me off his fingers broke whatever spell he wove. The illusion is shattered. Maybe getting up and washing in the middle of having sex didn\u2019t bother other girls, but it bothers me. I pictured my dream guy loving my scent, burying his face between my legs like he couldn\u2019t get enough, licking me off his fingers and then begging for more. That isn\u2019t going to be Edward. He ran to the bathroom before we were even done.</p> <p>Edward eyes me lazily and leans forward, sliding his hand into my waistband. Placing my hand over his, I stop him. He looks up into my eyes. I can\u2019t let it go. I have to know what I am dealing with. Is he mental or was this just a precaution since we haven\u2019t been together very long?</p><p>I ask, \u201cIf you found the right girl, the one you wanted in every way possible, would it be different? Would you want the scent and the feel of her on your hands?\u201d Would you want to taste her? Would you swallow? I wonder, too afraid to ask . The questions rush out. Suddenly, this conversation feels very awkward.</p><p>Edward sits up and withdraws his hand from my waist. He looks confused. I pull my shirt over my head so my breasts aren\u2019t just out there.</p><p>He watches me carefully, knowing he blew his chances with me tonight. He runs his fingers through his hair, \u201cIt bothered you.\u201d He breathes deeply, shaking his head like he\u2019s annoyed with himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Anna. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt your feelings, it\u2019s just that\u2014\u201d</p><p>I waive my hands at him, shaking my head, \u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt my feelings,\u201d the words are falling out of my mouth before I can stop them. It did bother me. It seemed like he couldn\u2019t get me off his skin fast enough. I was offended, but my mouth is saying I wasn\u2019t. What the hell is wrong with me? Why can\u2019t I just tell him what I want? I\u2019ve only been with two guys and neither of them did what I was hoping for either. I am barely twenty-two, but I know what I want. At some point I started to think that the things I want are strange. And I can\u2019t talk sex with Emma\u2014not when it\u2019s sex with her brother.</p><p>Looking relieved, he touches my cheek gently. \u201cGood, I\u2019m glad. I don\u2019t know what it is, but the idea of having someone else\u2019s fluids on me just makes me feel like I need to wash it off.\u201d He shivers like it\u2019s gross\u2014like I\u2019m gross\u2014and my heart sinks.</p> <p>I can\u2019t look at him. The bedspread is twirling between my fingers, my voice soft, \u201cSo, you probably don\u2019t like the idea of tasting me. There.\u201d The question is in my voice. I sound frail, like his words could hurt me. Maybe they could. I want him to say yes. I want him to want me.</p><p>Edward notices my tone, but he misreads my question. \u201cI\u2019d taste you there. I could do that.\u201d He doesn\u2019t sound eager. \u201cHonestly, the idea of you doing that to me is more appealing.\u201d He fumbles his words, laughing nervously.</p><p>I blink hard. What a dick. Did he really just say that?</p><p>Another question bashes me in the brain before I can think\u2014why didn\u2019t I notice this before?</p><p>Carefully, I ask, \u201cSo, I could go down on you and swallow, and you\u2019d like that?\u201d He nods at me, like he\u2019s ready to do it now.</p><p>This is what I was afraid of, he doesn\u2019t want to touch or taste me like that. It\u2019s one-sided. We can\u2019t do the things I want to do. Sex with him will be very limited if he doesn\u2019t like sweat and other slippery substances. The pit of my stomach drops. This relationship wasn\u2019t going to work. Damn. I\u2019d asked him if he had any sexual preferences I should know about. Clean-freak didn\u2019t come up. I lean my head back against the headboard and stare at the ceiling. I know there\u2019s no future for us, but I can\u2019t admit it. Things can\u2019t be this way. Not again.</p><p>\u201cAnna?\u201d he asks, his hand sliding over my knee.</p><p>\u201cHmmm?\u201d I can\u2019t look at him. It feels like my insides have been carved out. I feel the loss of things I thought I\u2019d have with him, things that will never be.</p> <p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he whispers. My neck snaps and I blink rapidly, staring at him. My heart rate shoots up to stroke territory. A boyish smile forms on his lips. He doesn\u2019t realize the effect of his words. \u201cJust because that doesn\u2019t appeal to me doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t want you.\u201d</p><p>My eyes are glassy. I feel like I\u2019m going to cry. He loves me? But he\u2019s too grossed out to show me the way I need. The way I want. I smile softly at him and he takes me in his arms, stroking my hair.</p><p>\u201cI know I said it too early,\u201d he says into my hair. His breath warms my throat. \u201cBut, I couldn\u2019t let you think\u2014\u201d</p><p>I pull back and look him in the eye. Smiling, I say, \u201cI love you, too.\u201d My words are sincere. I care about him. I think about it and realize that I do love him. I want things to work out between us, so I say it. But I say it too soon after he drops a bomb on us and the consequence is disastrous.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p><p>The next morning I find Emma sitting in the kitchen shoveling Cheerios into her mouth. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re dating my brother. That\u2019s so gross.\u201d Milk drools a little from the corner of her lips and she snort-laughs, wiping it away.</p><p>I roll my eyes. We\u2019ve had this conversation already. \u201cI know. Ick. Yuck. Don\u2019t tell you about sleeping with him. I know the rules, Em. I won\u2019t make it weirder that it has to be.\u201d</p><p>She points her spoon at me, \u201cI never called them rules\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame difference,\u201d I shrug. It was a condition of going out with her sibling. She didn\u2019t want to know details, didn\u2019t want to hear anything.</p><p>Memories of the night before play through my mind. I told him I loved him. That feels like the stupidest thing to have said. It will drag out the relationship when it should have been shot in the head. I need to talk to someone about it. I don\u2019t know what to do. Edward is great. This was his worst trait, and it doesn\u2019t seem that major in the light of day. But then again, it does. He made me feel like I was undesirable. The expression on his face when he left to wash his hands was burned behind my eyes. If he did that after we have sex, I wouldn\u2019t be able to take it. It was like he couldn\u2019t wait to get to the soap. I sighed, throwing my head back in an exaggerated whine.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t even,\u201d Emma says, \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted to date him. And I heard you last night\u2014which wasn\u2019t ideal by the way\u2014if you tell me what happened, I\u2019ll cut my ears off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then you\u2019ll look really dumb. And I\u2019m not telling you a thing,\u201d I snap and walk away.</p><p>It\u2019s Sunday. I head to my room and pull on a pair of ratty shorts and a tank top. Screw this. I\u2019m not sitting at home, moping. I\u2019m not that kind of girl. When things get messed up, I can sit around and sulk or try to figure out how to fix them. There has to be a way to fix this. I don\u2019t want to put my sexual fantasies to rest yet, although the last two guys had similar reactions. From what I\u2019ve read on the internet, the things I want aren\u2019t that weird. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My feet pound the pavement until I make it to the park. I have an earbud in one ear and the other is tucked into my sports bra strap. I want to be able to hear if someone is coming up behind me. I find my pace and jog the familiar trails beneath the leafy green canopy. The sunlight forms patches of lace on the ground. The splattering of light is a photographer\u2019s nightmare, and a nature-lover\u2019s dream. I\u2019m both. I love the feel sunlight on my skin.</p><p>My mind goes back to last night. If I can get through this with Edward, everything will be all right. It\u2019s always a little bumpy in the beginning, right? I think back to the other two men. Honestly, I \u2018m not even sure if they count. We did stuff, but my first boyfriend wasn\u2019t exactly skilled. And the second guy turned out to be an ass. I huff a steady stream of breaths. The music soon diverts my thoughts and I sing softly to myself, going faster\u2014trying to outrun problems that would crush me.</p><p>I don\u2019t realize how zoned out I am. Normally, I make sure I pay attention while I\u2019m running, but today I\u2019m out of it. As I pass the clearing toward the swank end of the park, I see someone on a bench stand up. My mind makes a mental note, but I don\u2019t notice that it\u2019s him until it is too late.</p><p>Suddenly, a strong hand touches my shoulder. Without hesitation, my elbow flies back and my fist comes up. I twist out of his grip and pivot, my knee rising to kick him in the crotch, when I see it is Cole Stevens. He is dressed in a suit like he\u2019s been at church. My knee nearly connects. When I realize who it is, I try to stop. It throws off my momentum and my knee kind of brushes his pants and I lose my balance.</p> <p>Before I can fall back, his hand shoots out and grips my arm. He steadies me, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to startle you. I\u2019m sorry, Anna.\u201d</p><p>Crap. Can this day get any worse? I just brushed my boss\u2019s nuts with my knee. I pull out of his grip, and bend at the waist breathing hard. Sweat drips down my spine. I sputter, \u201cWhat the hell, Stevens?\u201d Tiny beads slip over my neck and when I look up, they slip down between my breasts.</p><p>He holds up his hands, palms facing me like he means no harm. \u201cAgain, sorry. It\u2019s a mistake I won\u2019t repeat. You nearly took my balls off.\u201d His voice is light and he seems off balance.</p><p>I nod, admitting that\u2019s exactly what I would have done. He says nothing. After a moment, I ask \u201cWhat do you want? Did you stop me to throw more threats in my face?\u201d I shouldn\u2019t mention it again, but I had to.</p><p>\u201cNo. Nothing like that,\u201d he twitches slightly, like my words surprised him. \u201cActually, I wasn\u2019t sure it was you, until you attacked me\u2014\u201d</p> <p>My jaw drops, \u201cYou scared the hell out of me! I thought you\u2014\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s smiling, laughing at me, \u201cI know. I\u2019m teasing. Listen, I\u2019m sorry for the way things went yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Straightening, I wipe the sweat off my temples with the back of my hand, \u201cYeah, me too. I shouldn\u2019t have shown up dressed like a circus freak and you shouldn\u2019t have been a prick. Does that sum it up?\u201d I push the damp hair out of my face. \u201cLet\u2019s cut through the crap, Stevens.\u201d The smile melts off his lips. My voice is cold and curt, \u201cI don\u2019t like you and an apology isn\u2019t going to fix it. You fucked up my life, and I\u2019m not letting it go, so deal with it.\u201d</p><p>I stare into his eyes and wonder if he\u2019s a sociopath, but when our gazes lock my body reacts to something else. My heart skips a beat and my stomach twists. Annoyed, I turn on my heel, ready to jog away. His hand shoots out and clasps my wrist. The movement slows me. My body is covered in sweat. His hand pulls away damp, and he makes no effort to wipe me away\u2014no movement to show how repulsed he is by my appearance. I can\u2019t help but notice his reaction is different than Edward\u2019s.</p><p>Cole\u2019s jaw tenses, like he\u2019s trying not to fight with me, \u201cI plan on it. In the meantime, I wanted to tell you that I\u2019m willing to start over whenever you are\u2014with everything.\u201d His gaze is intense; his dark lashes lower after a moment. He looks past me, then back at my face.</p><p>\u201cThen let me go.\u201d My voice is soft, and askance. It doesn\u2019t sound like me. Unblinking, I look into his face. His eyes are an intense shade of blue with black and silver flecks. They are locked on mine.</p> <p>His lips form a thin line and he shakes his head, \u201cIt isn\u2019t what you want.\u201d</p><p>I look both ways, making sure no one is within ear shot, \u201cFuck you, Stevens! You have no idea what I want.\u201d My voice is low, threatening. He took away the thing I wanted most. In one move he out played me and I\u2019d pay for it for the rest of my life. I jab my finger into his chest, poking his ironed shirt. \u201cNo, wait. Actually, you do know what I want, because I told you. I was stupid enough to trust you and I told you exactly what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe internship with Sottero.\u201d</p><p>I nod, dropping my hand. \u201cAnd you made sure I\u2019d never have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he says pulling a phone out of his jacket pocket. The way the suit clings to his lean body makes me notice his figure. That suit fits him like it was made for him. It probably was. Fucking rich people think they own everyone. I don\u2019t want to stand there. I don\u2019t want to talk to him, but that phone makes me nervous. It feels like he\u2019s doing a replay of yesterday.</p><p>\u201cOne call puts things back the way you wanted,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll call Sophia right now. We swap interns. It\u2019s your choice.\u201d He arches a brow and glances at me, the phone cradled in his hand.</p><p>Shocked, I glance at his palm and then back at his face. I don\u2019t buy it, \u201cYou\u2019re lying. I don\u2019t know why, buy you\u2019ve decided\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLamore, you\u2019re trying my patience.\u201d He shifts his weight to the other foot, like he\u2019s been standing there too long. \u201cYou pissed me off yesterday, and there were better ways to deal with you. I apologize. I\u2019m not saying it again, and I won\u2019t offer this again. You blamed me for fucking up your life, so fix it. Have me call Sottero and you\u2019ll start there tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>I blink. It feels like I\u2019m falling off a cliff. There are no bearings and I can\u2019t tell which way is up. \u201cWhy are you doing this to me?\u201d My breath hitches in my throat and I want to punch him. \u201cWhy are you batting me around like my life doesn\u2019t matter? I don\u2019t come from a pampered-ass home like you did. Everything wasn\u2019t handed to me on a silver platter with a side of gold doubloons. I carved my own path, and you decided to crush it on a whim!\u201d My hands ball at my sides. No one pays any attention to us. They walk on by, ignoring my tirade.</p><p>\u201cDoubloons?\u201d his lips pull into a smirk. My eyes widen, shocked that he decides to tease me when I\u2019m ready to rip his head off in the middle of a very public park. Every inch of me is vibrating with anger and I know he can see it.</p><p>The smile fades from his face, \u201cFine.\u201d He presses a number on his phone. It dials and I hear a woman\u2019s voice, but I can\u2019t make out what she\u2019s saying. \u201cSophia,\u201d he says curtly. \u201cCole. Yes, I\u2019d like to exchange interns with you. I know you wanted Miss Lamore.\u201d He pauses, then nods. \u201cYes, a trade. Mine for yours. That\u2019s my offer. I\u2019m handing the phone to her. It\u2019s her call.\u201d Cole extends his arm, shoving the phone at me.</p><p>Time slows to a crawl. Light-years pass as I reach out to take it. Sophia\u2019s voice echoes in my ear. It\u2019s her. It\u2019s Sophia Sottero. She wanted me to be her intern. Yesterday could be erased. All I have to do is say yes.</p><p>\u201cAnna, darling let\u2019s put this whole mess behind us.\u201d She laughs, but it sounds bitter, \u201cYou know, for a moment I actually believed that you choose to work for Cole. As if you would sink to his level...\u201d she continues to criticize Cole, undermining his ability and reputation.</p><p>I stare at Cole wondering if he has any idea how much Sophia Sottero hates him. I missed it during the interview, but now it\u2019s completely clear. He\u2019s put his hands in his pants pockets and is looking at his shoe. The action makes him seem younger than he is. Why did he do this? He chased after me through the park, risked getting maced, and clipped in the groin by my knee\u2014for what? To say sorry? To set things right?</p><p>Something keeps me from speaking. I can\u2019t find my voice even though Sophia is excitedly chattering in my ear about the internship and the things I\u2019ll learn\u2014skills that I can use toward my own business one day. Skills that will help me get a kick-ass job at the end of the summer. Skills that I don\u2019t have and desperately need.</p><p>Skills that Cole can\u2019t give me.</p><p>Cole pushes a rock with his shiny black shoe. He doesn\u2019t look at me until it\u2019s obvious Sophia has grown quiet and I\u2019m not speaking. It feels like the air is fluid. I hear nothing. Sophia\u2019s words float away from me as she asks if I\u2019m still on the line.</p><p>Cole looks up at me. There\u2019s something there\u2014I can see it within him in that moment\u2014something that is better than I am. I would have never tried to fix a mistake of this magnitude like this. He is offering me everything I want, I just have to take it. He apologized. He fixed his mistake. I didn\u2019t.</p><p>Without a word to Sophia, I hand him back his phone wondering if I\u2019m insane. He takes it, but doesn\u2019t end the call. Glaring at him I say, \u201cLast time I trusted you, you screwed me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLikewise,\u201d his expression is hard.</p><p>\u201cSo, what?\u201d my eyes shift over his face, taking in the stance of his body, the tension in his shoulders. \u201cWe just start over?\u201d</p><p>He nods, \u201cYes.

The past twenty-four hours have left me in emotional overload. Edward is sitting next to me while I eat chocolate ice cream out of the carton. My hands are getting sticky. I can tell it\u2019s bothering him, but he says nothing. I consider taking his face in my hands and smearing the ice cream over his cheeks, and pressing my lips to his. Getting covered in ice cream and licking it off his skin sounds wonderful, but I don\u2019t do it. Edward would freak out. No sticky sex.</p><p>The TV flickers with some show neither of us is watching. Glancing at the carton, Edward says, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be nervous about tomorrow. Le Femme has a sterling reputation. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do fine.\u201d</p> <p>Edward thinks I\u2019m nervous. He thinks it\u2019s because tomorrow is my first day and I have new-job-jitters. I didn\u2019t tell him what happened in the park. Without meaning to, I bypassed an important part of my life. I just didn\u2019t want him to freak out about Cole, and now I can\u2019t backtrack and add what happened today.</p><p>I nod and shove another scoop in my mouth. \u201cThanks.\u201d I put the carton down and push it away. Grabbing the napkin, I wipe my hand off. When I go to hold Edward\u2019s hand, he takes it, but makes sure that he doesn\u2019t the touch the spot I cleaned with the napkin. \u201cI\u2019ve known you for what, two years and I had no idea you were such a germ-a-phobe.\u201d</p><p>He glances at me out of the corner of his eye, \u201cI\u2019m not. I just don\u2019t do sticky.\u201d</p><p>I snort, \u201cThen what do you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d his voice is soft and comforting. He wraps his arms around me and my anger deflates. \u201cYou seem bent out of shape. Like something\u2019s wrong. You can tell me, baby. If it\u2019s the ice cream, cover me in it. I\u2019d do sticky for you. I\u2019d do everything for you.\u201d</p><p>Those are the words I wanted to hear. I melt in his arms. The tension flows out of my body. I feel better. He made things better. \u201cI know you would.\u201d I lean into his chest and blink at the TV, not seeing the picture on the screen. \u201cCan you stay a little longer?\u201d</p> <p>He nods, \u201cAs long as you need.\u201d His hands pull my hair away from my face. \u201cSummer sessions don\u2019t start for another week. I can stay overnight, if you\u2019d like. On the couch,\u201d he adds quickly.</p><p>I smile, \u201cWhen you stay overnight, it won\u2019t be on the couch.\u201d I feel him smile against my head. He\u2019s happy. \u201cWhat\u2019d I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said when... not if.\u201d Turning me toward him, he tips my head back and lowers his lips to mine. His kiss heats my body and makes me feel better. When he releases me, he kisses my temple, and whispers into my ear, \u201cJust let me know when. I\u2019ll be there for you in every way you want.\u201d</p><p>They are nice words, words that I wanted to hear\u2014words that I needed to hear. But even as he says them, I know they are like the early morning mist that burns away in full heat of the sun.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>The skinny girl looks like a model, not a receptionist. \u201cYes?\u201d she asks as I push through the door on Monday morning. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m dressed normally now, a dark suit clings to my body. It\u2019s not as nice as hers, but interns aren\u2019t paid much and I\u2019m next to broke. \u201cAnna Lamore. I\u2019m the new intern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes,\u201d she presses her manicured finger to a button on her desk phone. It looks like a sleek piece of glass. Figures. Cole has a designer phone, and a designer receptionist. The piece of plastic beeps and I hear his voice.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cole\u2019s voice sounds relaxed.</p><p>\u201cMiss Lamore is here. Should I send her back?\u201d I stand there in shock. Why is she telling him? Cole can\u2019t be the one training the intern. That doesn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he replies.</p><p>She stands and smooths her outfit. She\u2019s wearing a silk skirt with a vibrant floral pattern. Her blouse is sheer and I can see a lacy cami underneath. Her arms are bare. The heels make her nearly a foot taller than me. \u201cThis way Miss Lamore. I\u2019m Vanessa Todd...\u201d she speaks as she takes me through the building toward Cole.</p><p>I trail behind the woman, feeling like an ogre in comparison. I try to remember everything she\u2019s saying but feel a little bit overwhelmed. When we stop in front of the mahogany doors, she places a hand on my shoulder. I glance up at her.</p><p>\u201cIf you need anything, have any questions, I\u2019m happy to help you get on your feet here.\u201d</p><p>Dazed, I nod and smile, \u201cThank you.\u201d She walks away leaving me alone. The studio is quiet and I can\u2019t help but wonder where everyone is. This is a huge company. There should be graphic designers, photographers, and assistants\u2014but there\u2019s no one in the halls. The offices we passed are empty.</p><p>I look at the silver plaque on the door. It\u2019s Cole\u2019s office. His name is scrawled across the plaque in an elegant script. I push the door open and step through.</p><p>I don\u2019t feel nervous, but I\u2019m not confident either. Yesterday knocked me off kilter. The day before that blindsided me. Since I met Cole Stevens, nothing has gone according to plan. The thought of hanging up on Sophia Sottero made me feel sick. There\u2019s no way to know if I\u2019ve made the right decision, not until it\u2019ll be too late, but I refuse to second guess myself. Something burned through me yesterday in the park. It was like a spark of fate ignited within me indicating my future was somehow tied to Cole. I don\u2019t believe in destiny, but the surge of\u2014whatever it was\u2014was too powerful to ignore. It made me confidently end the call with Sophia Sottero and walk into Cole Steven\u2019s office today.</p><p>Cole\u2019s sitting on his desk wearing designer jeans that hug his beautiful body perfectly. I wish I could afford jeans like that. After the thought passes, I realize that I\u2019m over-dressed. He swings his legs once, dangling his feet. The desk is made from dark, carved wood. It must have cost a fortune.</p><p>Cole looks up at me from a manila file folder on his lap. \u201cMiss Lamore. Good to see you.\u201d His gaze slips over my body, taking in my formal attire. \u201cFor future reference, casual clothing works best here. Crawling around during shoots in a pencil skirt isn\u2019t ideal. I would have mentioned it the other day, but your outfit kind of shocked the hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>The corner of my lips pull up and I laugh. I didn\u2019t know what to expect today, but this surprises me. \u201cThat was my intention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, well. It worked. I\u2019ve never seen anyone show up to an interview dressed like a giant Skittle.\u201d He looks me square in the face and grins. \u201cI was hoping you weren\u2019t insane. Good to see you can dress yourself.\u201d He\u2019s teasing me. It makes me smile and relax a little bit.</p><p>I step closer to the desk, half listening while looking at the books that line the walls. \u201cHar. Har. Very funny. So tell me. Why is this place empty?\u201d I can\u2019t address him with revere, not after the way we met.</p><p>He looks up from the papers in his hands. They look like bills. There are numbers across the sheets, dates, and dollar signs. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is here, except for Amazon Barbie at the front desk. Where is everyone? I would have thought Le Femme had at least twenty employees on any given day, running around half clothed\u2014or half naked, depending on how you look at it.\u201d Was I joking? Where\u2019d the light teasing tone come from? What the hell is wrong with me?</p><p>I blink hard, trying to find my brain and make it work while I scan the spines on the bookcase. It\u2019s filled with art books about Romanticism. My mind tries to make sense of that. The Romantics are known for their somber sublime works. Looking at those pieces of art make the viewer feel a sense of loss and uncertainty. Cole\u2019s work makes people want the girl in the shot, or her underwear. I don\u2019t turn to look at him as I ask. I don\u2019t want him to notice my shock.</p><p>I feel his eyes on my back when he answers, \u201cMiss Todd is the receptionist. She\u2019s here weekdays. Everyone else is already out on the Island. We\u2019re keeping a skeleton crew here for the week. Guess who\u2019s on skeleton staff?\u201d</p><p>I whip my head around, and my hair flies over my shoulders. What? Is he serious? I\u2019m alone with him here for a week? \u201cThere\u2019s no one else here? For a week? Why?\u201d My mouth is hanging open. It won\u2019t close and I have no idea why.</p><p>He chuckles and puts the papers next to him. Leaning forward on the desk, he puts a hand on either side of his hips. The effect makes his arms look perfect. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs that a problem, Miss Lamore?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. It feels like it\u2019s full of rocks. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, \u201cI thought that someone else would be in charge of me, I mean my internship.\u201d</p> <p>He looks me over once and says, \u201cWell, like it or not, I\u2019m the boss of you this week. We have a shoot later today, and then three more later in the week. I want you to assist, and then I want you to second shoot on Friday\u2019s session.\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t swallow. My mouth goes dry. I don\u2019t think I heard him right. Did he say shoot? I cock my head and stare at him like he\u2019s crazy, \u201cExcuse me? Did you say you want me to shoot a real session in less than a week? I\u2019ve never done this before!\u201d</p><p>He blows off my high-pitched protest with a wave of his hand, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201d He slides off his desk, shoves the papers in his drawer and it finally sinks in. What he said about everyone else being out on Long Island finally sinks in.</p><p>\u201cWhy is the staff out East? Is there something going on?\u201d Truth be told, I had no idea what was going on. For all I knew it was a company retreat.</p><p>He shakes his head, \u201cNot really. Just an expansion.\u201d</p> <p>My mouth forms an O but I don\u2019t say anything else. Damn. A second studio on Long Island. Unless he stuck the new studio in the \u2018hood, Cole was paying more in rent each month than I could earn in a year.</p><p>He looks up at me. His dark hair curls slightly as it hangs over his forehead. He pushes it back. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>I answer straight-faced, totally dead pan, \u201cReady as I\u2019ll ever be. Show me to the naked girls.\u201d</p><p>Cole nearly chokes, and then laughingly scoffs at me, \u201cWhy do all you feminists think I shoot naked women?\u201d</p><p>I follow him down the hallway. We are headed towards a million dollar shooting room. Curiosity alone makes me want to see it. \u201cBecause you do,\u201d I answer bluntly.</p><p>Cole turns and looks at me over his shoulder, \u201cThey\u2019re wearing more clothes than most women wear at the beach. That\u2019s hardly fair.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLife\u2019s not fair, dude. Get over it.\u201d</p><p>He stops in his tracks and turns in slow motion. His dark brows are lifting into his hairline. \u201cDude? Seriously? You called me dude?\u201d He looks shocked and can\u2019t hide the smile that\u2019s running across his lips.</p><p>Not realizing that I said it, I try to cover my tracks, \u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid dude. You called me dude.\u201d His eyes are so blue. The way he looks at me makes my heart race. The grin on his face makes the corners of his eyes crinkle a little bit. The expression he\u2019s making is cute and confused. I should be embarrassed, but I\u2019m not.</p><p>I shrug, like it doesn\u2019t matter, \u201cWould you prefer something else?\u201d My lips twist into a smile. I can\u2019t help it. It doesn\u2019t matter that I wanted to torment him yesterday. This side of him makes me want to tease him more.</p><p>His eyes sweep over me before returning to my face. He laughs, \u201cYou\u2019re so young. You have no idea\u2014\u201d</p><p>I nod once, the smile fading from my lips. Completely serious, I look him in the eyes and say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to be disrespectful. From now on, I\u2019ll refrain from calling you dude.\u201d He looks at me. I nod, and after a moment, I add in my most respectful voice, \u201cOld dude or geezer would be way better.\u201d Our eyes remain locked. My lips twitch as I try not to laugh. I have no idea why I\u2019m teasing him again.</p><p>He huffs, rolling his eyes, \u201cYou\u2019re such a child.\u201d Running his fingers through his hair he mutters, \u201cI\u2019m getting too old for this crap.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMmmm,\u201d I answer, \u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t have hired the chick dressed like a circus clown.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>The studio is the coolest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. It has everything I want in my own shooting room and more. Cole shows me around quickly and tells me to ditch my jacket and heels. We\u2019re shooting for the rest of the afternoon. A model is due in at any moment. While we are waiting for her, I slip off my shoes and kick them under a table. That leaves me barefoot in a black pencil skirt with a sleeveless blouse.</p><p>I feel underdressed now, but barely process it because I\u2019m too captivated by the shooting room, especially the sets. The walls are lined with them. There are four total\u2014one white, one black, one pink, and one gray. Each set has its own feel and different items. They are all posh feeling with lots of different textures. The white set\u2019s easily my favorite. White flocked wall paper surrounds a white velvet chaise that has a fuzzy white throw over the arm. Bleached wood floors give it just a little bit of warmth so it doesn\u2019t feel sterile.</p><p>Cole speaks as he moves about the room, explaining how the shoot will go and what to expect. \u201cNever touch the model without asking. Never say anything inappropriate,\u201d Cole glances at me like he isn\u2019t sure if I can control my mouth. \u201cThose are the only two rules that you need to know for today.\u201d</p><p>I nod, \u201cWhat am I going to do? I thought that I\u2019d be getting coffee or something.\u201d</p><p>My gaze is on a rack of wardrobe, if you could call panty and bra sets wardrobe. They are the things we\u2019re shooting today. Honestly, they\u2019re cute. And one is insanely sexy. It is a white shelf bra with a matching lace G-string. It is the kind of thing I would want to wear, but it wouldn\u2019t look good on me. I have too many curves for that kind of skimpy thing. I rub the lace with my thumb, feeling how soft it is.</p><p>Cole stops moving, watching me for a moment before saying, \u201cMaybe if you were at Sottero. At Le Femme, you work. If you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t get paid.\u201d</p><p>Dropping the bra, I turn sharply. \u201cI get paid?\u201d</p><p>He nods and looks at me surprised, \u201cWhat\u2019d you think, you were working for free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d my eyes are wide and I\u2019m still shocked, thinking he\u2019s dicking with me, \u201cyeah. Internships aren\u2019t paid.\u201d</p><p>He shrugs, \u201cThis one is. You get about $2200 per week, take home, after taxes. Miss Todd can give you the exact amount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d the words fly out of my mouth. My jaw is hanging open. I quickly slap my palms over my face and shut the gaping hole to keep anything else from flying out.</p><p>Cole looks at me like I\u2019m crazy. He shakes his head and lifts his camera off a shelf. Selecting a lens, he puts it on and adjusts the settings. \u201cHow did you not know it was paid?\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cYou\u2019re going to learn so much more here than you would anywhere else.</p><p>\u201cLesson 1: Never work for free. Some new photographers think you have to, that you can build your client list by offering free sessions. Don\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I ask, still shocked that I\u2019m getting paid and really happy about it.</p><p>He looks over his shoulder at me, \u201cBecause free is never free. It always costs something. Money. Time. Reputation. Those are things that you need to work hard to control. Giving them away for free screws with perceived value, and your worth as an artist.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m staring at the side of his face, shocked. Cole shoots girls in their underwear. What does he know about marketing and business practices? He sells sex, and sex sells itself. Cole notices me staring at him. He glances up and opens his mouth to say something, but the intercom buzzes. The model is in the building and on her way back. Whatever he was going to say died on his lips.</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>For the next three hours Cole is serious. He tells me what to do and I do it. I\u2019m standing, bending, kneeling and doing the assistant\u2019s job. At one point I have to reset the model\u2019s hair. She moved and it\u2019s no longer in place. It\u2019s when she\u2019s wearing that shelf bra. Her perfectly man-made boobs fill the thing up. To make the ad compliant with the company\u2019s guidelines, there can\u2019t be any nipples showing. Cole was right. Most of the shoot hasn\u2019t felt weird, not once I realized that she is covered. The only thing that\u2019s awkward is this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cole,\u201d Angela says, her sultry voice matches her curvaceous body. I\u2019m slightly envious, but she\u2019s too tall. In real life it must be hard to find someone to kiss without bending down. That sucks for a girl.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d he says. \u201cMiss Lamore will reset your hair. Don\u2019t move. Everything else is still perfect.\u201d Cole gestures for me. I step onto the set of the white room, and he says, \u201cTake that strand of curls and drape it over her breast. Ask her before you touch her. Company policy.\u201d</p><p>I feel stupid. She\u2019s leaning backward over the chase. Her hair is spilling all around her and I\u2019m asking to move a strand over her boob. I ask, and do as I\u2019m told. She smiles at me and grants permission. I take the lock and drape it across her flesh, but I can\u2019t see if it covered her properly from the angle Cole is shooting.</p><p>\u201cIs that okay?\u201d I ask and step back.</p><p>\u201cNo, I can still see her. Use more strands,\u201d he replies. He\u2019s looking at his camera and adjusting settings. \u201cMake sure I can\u2019t see anything through the center of the curl.\u201d</p><p>I ask the model if I can touch her again and move more curls. Her hair doesn\u2019t want to stay. It slides off her breast and I\u2019m starting to make it frizz. The hairstylist is standing in the corner with her arms folded over her chest. The make-up artist is watching from her chair on the other side of the room. No doubt they both think I\u2019m going to screw this up. How hard can it be to get some hair to stay? She has enough of it and it\u2019s insanely long. I try again, but the curls slide off. I\u2019m starting to get bent out of shape. I\u2019m blushing horribly, touching some girl\u2019s breast and I still can\u2019t do it. I refuse to ask Cole for help, but he\u2019s already next to me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>From over my shoulder, he says, \u201cHook the edge of the curl on her nipple. The one curl will hold and then you can place another over it.\u201d</p><p>I freeze when I hear him speak, and shiver. The way he says it, like he uses the word nipple frequently, shoots up warning flags in my mind. His proximity puts me off kilter. I feel his eyes on my back, waiting for me to do it. Suddenly I wonder if I can do this job, and everything it entails. Being comfortable around bodies changing in the gym is one thing, touching to make the poses right is another.</p><p>I swallow hard, my fingers hovering above the curl. Cole seems annoyed\u2014or disappointed\u2014and says, \u201cCome on, Anna. This is the last set for today. Once we shoot this, we\u2019re done.\u201d He hoovers, waiting for me.</p><p>My hand is shaking for some reason. It might have something to do with Cole being so close. It might have to do with paying such careful attention to someone else\u2019s nipples. Irritated with myself, I blow out a huff of air between my lips and take the curl.</p> <p>I chose this. I passed up Sottero. This was my choice.</p><p>I do as he says and the curl stays. I beam like an idiot, and then quickly drape the other locks in place. They all hold. I step back into Cole, smashing his toes with my bare feet. He\u2019s not wearing shoes either. Cole steadies me, his warm hands on my elbows.</p><p>From behind my shoulders, he says, \u201cDon\u2019t be shy when you\u2019re shooting. It makes your job harder. You could have used fashion tape to hold the hair in place, but we don\u2019t want to do anything we don\u2019t have to. Tape in hair sucks. The temperature in the room is warm, but it\u2019s still chilly enough\u2014for obvious reasons. I thought you\u2019d be okay with this kind of stuff.\u201d His hands slip away from my elbows and he passes in front of me. The sound of the shutter snapping fills my ears. He\u2019s so at ease, moving, speaking, and acting like this woman is anyone else and not a nearly-naked super-model.</p><p>I don\u2019t answer.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want this job, but I chose it. This wasn\u2019t my career goal, but here I am. I\u2019m perplexed because this shoot isn\u2019t what I thought it would be. I moved at ease through the room, right up until this last part. And the only reason I hesitated was because of Cole. It wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t notice the half nude person in the room, it\u2019s that I wasn\u2019t as uncomfortable as I thought I\u2019d be.</p> <p>And Cole, he was nothing like I thought he\u2019d be. I expected him to be sleazy, touchy, and filled with innuendo. As the shoot progressed, I don\u2019t know if he even realized the woman he was shooting wasn\u2019t clothed. This was second nature to him. It\u2019s like he is a fish and this scandalous world of his is water. He doesn\u2019t notice it, and he moves through it with ease.</p><p>Today I learned that Cole Stevens isn\u2019t the photographer I thought he was, and neither am I.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>Edward\u2019s arm is draped across my shoulder. We are walking down the street to the steady hum of car engines. The buildings glow against the inky sky. The diner was packed after work. We met there, shared a meal, and are walking back to my place. By the time I finished with work, I was starving.</p><p>Edward squeezes my shoulder, and grins down at me, \u201cSo, tell me how today went. What do you do all day? How\u2019s working with your boss?\u201d We didn\u2019t talk about work at dinner, instead I put it off. He lifts his chin and we stop at a corner, waiting for the light to change. A car horn blares behind us. When the light changes, we walk in the mass of people.</p><p>I say, \u201cWell, it turns out my boss is Cole Stevens.\u201d</p> <p>Edward gasps, \u201cNo way.\u201d He knows who Cole is. Everyone knows who Cole is, so that isn\u2019t surprising. But, like me, Edward assumed someone else would be overseeing the internship.</p><p>Nodding, I say, \u201cYeah. It turns out that he\u2019s in charge of my internship. I stay here with him to do some shoots in the city this week, and then the rest of the summer, I\u2019ll be out East on Long Island somewhere. I probably should have asked where.\u201d My voice trails off.</p><p>I grew up out there. In the back of my mind, I\u2019m hoping that the new studio is near enough to my parent\u2019s house to commute. Housing arrangements would be an issue, paid or not. Renting something short term on Long Island was expensive.</p><p>His shoulders sag and Edward stops walking, \u201cNo. The whole summer? Are you serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize exactly what this internship included until today, but it\u2019s only a few weeks.\u201d He still looks crestfallen. I add, \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like I\u2019m that far away. I\u2019m sure we can get together a few times a week.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s smiling at me again. Pulling me close, we stop on the sidewalk. People walk past us, some bumping into me, but I don\u2019t care. In the moment, there is only Edward and me. He lowers his lips to mine and that familiar light feeling floats through my stomach. Gently, he pushes my hair away from my cheek.</p><p>He breaks the kiss, and breathes deeply. A rush of warm breath flows from his lips as he breathes, \u201cOh God, I want you. When you kiss me like that, I can\u2019t think. You\u2019re amazing.\u201d His fingers tangle in my hair. I look up into his cool eyes. The way he looks at me makes me squirm. Someone bumps my elbow. It brings attention back to where we are.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d better get home so I can make you think even less,\u201d I try not to giggle. I try to be sexy, but I laugh softly anyway. Taking his hand in mine, we walk faster down the street.</p> <p>By the time we plow through the apartment door, his hands are all over me. One is pushing up my skirt, my leg is hiked up and wrapped around his hips, while he cups the curve of my ass. We don\u2019t break the kiss. I\u2019m so hot. It feels like every inch of me is on fire. I want him. I need him. The place between my legs is throbbing. Feeling his lips there is what I want, but I\u2019m too afraid to ask. I want him to do it, I want him to take me\u2014and not ask permission\u2014to have me how he wants. But Edward won\u2019t do that. He\u2019s too cautious, that carnal part of him seems buried too deep. I wonder if I\u2019ll ever get at the part of him that\u2019s wild and dauntless. The part of Edward that\u2019s more animal than man, the part that wants me in every way. I tell myself that every relationship has problems and that we can learn to deal with them.</p><p>My hand slides down between us and below his waistband. I stroke his hard length, hoping he\u2019ll ravish me the way I want him to. His breath hitches and before I can do anything, his fingers are around my wrist. \u201cSlow down, babe.\u201d He\u2019s breathing hard in my ear, his face is flushed.</p><p>Disappointed I say, \u201cDon\u2019t you ever just want to tear my clothes off and take me?\u201d</p><p>Between kisses down my neck, he says, \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>My heart is pounding. Pulling his face back, I hold his cheeks between my palms. Breathing hard I say, \u201cThen do it. Anything you want, anyway you want. Right now.\u201d</p><p>His eyes are wide and dark. They look into mine with an expression that makes me afraid. Edward doesn\u2019t move. His eyes drift lower, watching the deep breaths making my chest rise and fall. After a moment, he steps back and releases me. A rush of cold fills the void. Ice drips down my spine. He\u2019s going to reject me. That look on his face says what I already know.</p><p>He pushes his hair out of his eyes and looks up at me, \u201cI\u2014\u201c he starts to say, but a noise stops him from speaking. The telltale sound of metal scraping lets us know the door is being unlocked. Emma will step into the room any second. His eyes are apologetic, like he can\u2019t be the man I want.</p><p>I don\u2019t understand.</p><p>We blink at each other as Emma pushes the door open and turns to yank her key out of the lock. She sees us, but doesn\u2019t sense the tension right away, \u201cHey guys. Anna, you gotta tell me how today went. I can\u2019t wait\u2014\u201d she turns and realizes she walked in on something. It\u2019s probably not what she thinks it is.</p><p>I act like nothing happened, and turn toward the kitchen. I pull open the fridge door and bend over, peering inside. \u201cIt was interesting. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d I need a drink. Where\u2019s the wine?</p><p>I hear plastic bags being set on the counter. Emma says, \u201cI bought your favorite.\u201d She holds up a bottle of White Merlot. I could die. Smiling at me, she holds the bottle by the neck. \u201cYou guys can celebrate without me. I totally didn\u2019t mean to...\u201d</p><p>I cut her off, \u201cYou didn\u2019t. And we already celebrated, didn\u2019t we Edward?\u201d</p><p>He nods, \u201cYup. Dinner and stuff.\u201d He\u2019s staring at me. I can\u2019t tell what he wants from me. I wish he\u2019d just take me in his arms and say he wanted me. But he says nothing. He stands there with his arms folded like he\u2019s an awkward kid.</p><p>Emma pulls out two glasses and looks at her brother, \u201cWell, I want to hear about it. Sorry if it\u2019s old news to you. So are you staying or going?\u201d She has her fingers on a third glass, but he shakes his head.</p><p>\u201cNah, I\u2019ll head home. Things to think about.\u201d His eyes are on me, but I can\u2019t look at him. \u201cCongratulations, Anna.\u201d He steps toward me, and kisses my temple. I smile at him, but it\u2019s one of those smiles that feels wrong, like the lines of my face are filled with cement. \u201cSee you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>I nod, \u201cSure,\u201d my voice is too soft.</p><p>He knows our relationship is broken. He likes slow and steady. I like everything else. Slow makes me fall into a coma. Steady isn\u2019t my idea of romantic. But I don\u2019t want to lose him. In every other way, we\u2019re perfect together. He steps toward the door and lets himself out. I watch him go. Part of me wants to call him back and be with him his way, but I don\u2019t move. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emma watches me. She can tell I\u2019m out of sorts, but she doesn\u2019t mention it. Instead we talk about Cole and work and half-naked models. I tell her that I hold reflectors, move lights, and adjust things on set. I leave out that adjustments include things of a more sensual nature.</p><p>\u201cSo, Cole was with you today?\u201d she asks, knowing it\u2019s weird. \u201cAnna, interns are treated like dirt, and you have the owner doing yours. You ever wonder why?\u201d</p><p>For a second the only response I have is a half open mouth. \u201cI have. And I don\u2019t know. For some reason he didn\u2019t want Sottero to have me. That much, I\u2019m sure of.\u201d</p><p>She nods at me. Although she hasn\u2019t said it, the question\u2014the reason she\u2019s thinking\u2014has crossed my mind as well. Maybe it was more than he didn\u2019t want Sottero to have me. Maybe he actually wanted me. But that doesn\u2019t make sense. I have next to no reputation, and the one I do have says I\u2019m a pain in the ass, stubborn to a fault.</p> <p>\u201cSo, next week you\u2019ll be out East somewhere. How\u2019d Edward take that?\u201d she asks, and then adds. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything, if you don\u2019t want to, but when I walked through the door, you looked like someone hit you in the head with a frying pan. I\u2019d be a shitty friend if I didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>I snort, and pull my knees into my chest. We\u2019re sitting on the living room floor. Half the bottle of wine is gone. Tucking a stray hair behind my ear, I stare at my glass, \u201cHe was okay with it. That\u2019s not the problem. He\u2019s always supportive, exactly the kind of guy a girl hopes for.\u201d</p><p>She watches me. After a moment she asks, \u201cBut not you?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, I say, \u201cIt gets into things I can\u2019t discuss with you.\u201d I stare at my toes. Sighing, I finally just ask her, \u201cYou know I\u2019ve only had two serious relationships. One was a stoner, and the other was\u2014\u201d I try to find the right words, but Emma choses them for me.</p><p>\u201cA dick.\u201d She throws back the rest of her wine.</p> <p>I nod, \u201cYeah, so I don\u2019t really know what to expect. I mean, if a guy was great in every single way but your bedroom preferences didn\u2019t exactly line up, what would you do?\u201d I stumble over the words as I say them.</p><p>She blinks once and stares at me. \u201cIf you asked me that before my third glass of wine, I think I would have puked on you. And I might now, anyway.\u201d</p><p>I roll my eyes at her, \u201cStop it. Be serious for once. I need you. I\u2019m not talking about your brother. I\u2019m talking about me. I\u2019m a freak, Emma. Guys seem to think that I\u2019m this little goodie-two-shoes kinda girl, and I\u2019m not. I want things... things that they seem to think are weird. What do I do?\u201d</p><p>Emma seems intrigued. \u201cWhat kind of things do you want that no one will do?\u201d</p><p>I shrug, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Things.\u201d I can\u2019t say it. I don\u2019t want to. But I know what I want, and if I\u2019m with Edward, I\u2019ll be three for zero, in terms of guys that make me melt.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you\u2019re a bad liar. But I understand if you don\u2019t want to tell me. I\u2019ve done some things that I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone about either.\u201d I glance up at her surprised. She shrugs, \u201cThe right guy makes just about anything sound sexy. But that\u2019s not your problem.\u201d She pushes her dark hair out of her face. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t throw away an entire relationship based on the sex, but staying in a relationship where you both want different things, I don\u2019t know...\u201d Her tone is leading, but she\u2019s saying what I already know.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s settling, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems that way,\u201d she nods and reaches for my glass. She refills both our cups and the bottle is empty. She glances at her glass, \u201cAfter I drink this, I won\u2019t have any recollection of our conversation, so if you have to ask me funky sex stuff that involves my twin, you\u2019d better do it now.\u201d She makes a face and I laugh.</p><p>I hold onto her shoulder, \u201cI can\u2019t do that to you. Telling you that I want more than he\u2019s willing to give is enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s the problem that you\u2019ll face with every guy,\u201d she lifts her glass and taps it against mine. The crystal rings. \u201cCheers, Anna. May your future be filled with someone who can give you everything you need.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I need,\u201d Cole says in a huff.</p><p>He pushes past me and grabs a different white cloth from the prop closet. There are so many props. I have no idea how he decides which to use. He steps in front of me, takes the prop, and walks toward the set.</p><p>A model is sitting on a chaise with her back toward us. She\u2019s wearing a tiny panty made of strings. It connects below her hips with a snake wrapped around a red crystal apple, the symbol of Evil Eve. Like Eve was in on it with the serpent in the Garden of Eden. I keep my feminist statements to myself, and follow Cole.</p> <p>\u201cThe set is too smooth,\u201d Cole explains. \u201cAdding something like this will visually add texture and softness. You want the viewer\u2019s eye to rest on the curve of her back, right where that apple is. The snake is the leading line that creates the flow of the composition. If you don\u2019t put something in the bottom quadrant of the image, it won\u2019t work as well.\u201d Cole tosses down a fuzzy white rug. He bends at his knees, barefoot, and plays with it until it lies haphazardly, like was thrown there.</p><p>I watch him place the rug, but I am having trouble. Shaking my head, I say, \u201cI don\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>He doesn\u2019t turn toward me. Instead he lifts his camera to his eye and shoots. His fingers curve over the lens and the shutter snaps. Over his shoulder, he says, \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t reply.</p><p>Cole shows me settings on the cameras and lights. He has me move things on set. Basically, I\u2019m his beckon girl. He asks for something and I do it. As the day progresses, I\u2019m starting to see what he\u2019s doing. It comes together with the shoot from the other day. He works his way through the four sets, always shooting to show the model\u2019s best assets while complimenting the teeny tiny lingerie she\u2019s wearing. The trademark Le Femme sexy poses aren\u2019t by accident. Every bit of them is Cole. It\u2019s the way he sees a scene and makes it come together.</p><p>At the end of the day, I\u2019m backing up the shoot onto his computer along the back wall of the studio. Cole walks up behind me after shutting off the lights in the massive room behind us. The crew and model have left. It\u2019s later than usual. I want to leave, but the shoot ran late.</p><p>I watch the data transfer. As each thumbnail shows up on the screen, I look at it. I kind of like that panty after seeing it all day. It\u2019s sexy, or at least I think it is.</p><p>I wonder how many things are sexy because someone told me they are.</p><p>Cole reaches past me, his finger pressing the screen. A thumbnail just appeared. He\u2019s pointing at it, \u201cThat\u2019s the shot before the rug. This is the shot after.\u201d He leans in, not paying attention to how close he is, \u201cSee how this image makes you glance and look away?\u201d I nod. It does do that, but I didn\u2019t know why. \u201cIt\u2019s because the composition is messed up. The flow is broken. There\u2019s nowhere for the eye to rest or reenter the image. But this one,\u201d he points at the picture with the rug, \u201cis better. Since it\u2019s white on white, the texture doesn\u2019t detract from the focal point, but it lends to the overall image.\u201d He turns to look at me. He\u2019s in my circle of space, but I don\u2019t feel the need to force him out. Although I haven\u2019t been around Cole very long, I\u2019ve already noticed that he isn\u2019t a touchy person. He doesn\u2019t seem to linger this close to anyone else. I wonder if he\u2019s doing it on purpose.</p><p>\u201cThis shoot was more risqu\u00e9 than the one we did the other day.\u201d</p><p>I nod slowly, \u201cYeah, I suppose it was.\u201d He\u2019s still too close. I arch a brow at him, wondering what he\u2019s doing.</p><p>He grins, \u201cYou didn\u2019t notice, did you? That she was wearing a piece of string all day?\u201d</p><p>Thinking about it, I lean back in my chair. Cole steps in front of me and sits down on the desk. \u201cI suppose not. Actually, I hated that piece of clothing this morning... but it grew on me during the day.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrow rose, surprised, \u201cDid it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I first saw it, I thought it was saying women are evil, you know the temptress bitch scenario.\u201d He laughs even though I\u2019m being serious. \u201cShut up. It\u2019s real. Look it up,\u201d I say, grinning. \u201cAnyway, as the day passed, I thought it was sexy. I think that\u2019s kind of amazing about this place\u2014you get to define what\u2019s sexy.\u201d</p><p>His arms fold over his toned chest while I speak. There\u2019s a gleam in his eye that I can\u2019t ignore. It makes my stomach flip-flop when he looks at me like that. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted you to work here. I knew you\u2019d see it. Le Femme isn\u2019t about making women into sex objects. You missed that before. When you first spoke to me, that was all you thought we were. But now you see it. Don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I nod. Cautiously, I say, \u201cIt\u2019s more about defining femininity and power. You showcase your ideals, putting them into pictures.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d only been here for a few days, but there is a reason why I am the best in my class. I see things no one else does. When I find something I don\u2019t understand, I want to know everything about it until I understand it fully. Right now, I feel that way about Cole. He confuses the hell out of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I tilt my head, looking up at him, \u201cWas that your intention when you started shooting?\u201d</p><p>He laughs, \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask if you were right. Most people would have waited for confirmation of their claim, and then asked the next question.\u201d He has a dimple on his cheek when he smiles hard.</p><p>\u201cDude, we both know I\u2019m right and that I\u2019m slightly arrogant\u2014kind of like you\u2014so let\u2019s just call it what it is so you can answer my question.\u201d He laughs. \u201cWhen you started Le Femme, did you set out to showcase femininity and power?\u201d Sometime while I was speaking, I sat up. By the time I finish, the tips of my fingers are on his knee, and I am looking up at him. I smile noncommittally, and lean back into my chair, slouching, not sure why I did that.</p><p>His lips press together into a straight line, almost disappearing. His hands rest on either side of his hips on the desk. He leans forward when I lean back, \u201cYou\u2019re dangerous, you know that? Not only do you see things clearly\u2014well, when you actually take the time to look at them\u2014but you also call people on it. You demand honesty.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m scary as hell,\u201d I joke.</p><p>\u201cMore than you know,\u201d he says seriously. His eyes rove over my face like he\u2019s considering something. He looks to the side, careful to avoid my eyes. Rubbing an imaginary spot on his jeans, he says, \u201cI started Le Femme as a fly-by-night artist. I wanted to be a painter, but that didn\u2019t pay the bills. Someone took pity on me and handed me a camera. I was able to cut my own path from there.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was on my own, I didn\u2019t like what I saw. Women were portrayed as weak. They were cast into a mold that no longer fits,\u201d he looks up at me and continues, \u201cif it ever did. The pieces that dominated the market only show a certain type of woman\u2014a specific type of beauty. I want to show what I think is beautiful. I want the world to see things through my eyes. And I can do that Anna, I can make you see my perspective through this lens.\u201d He taps at the glass on the end of his camera and looks up at me. \u201cIt tilts the world on its side. It has the potential to change everything, every concept you have, every belief you hold...\u201d he places the camera down and shakes his head, running his fingers through his hair. \u201cGod, if you saw my earlier work, you wouldn\u2019t believe it. Le Femme pays the bills. Le Femme is the tame version of me and that\u2019s the Cole Stevens the world knows.</p><p>\u201cSo, yeah, my ideals leaked into my work. I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s impossible to keep them out, no matter how hard I try.\u201d</p><p>While he speaks, I\u2019m glued in place, mesmerized. His blue eyes pierce me and hold me still. I forget to breathe. Stunned, I wonder, who the hell is this? Who is this man? Do I know him at all? Was every assumption I made, every educated guess about him completely wrong?</p> <p>I drool at him, lost in the shy passion barely contained in his voice, until he says he was on his own. Liar. I know that\u2019s not true. I know he comes from money. Everyone knows that, so I wonder why he says it\u2014why he tries to tell such a blatant lie. Does he think I\u2019m a moron? Maybe. Instead of calling him on it, I listen to the rest of his story. His passion is addictive.</p><p>As soon as he stops speaking, I want to hear more, even if it is lies. No one talks like that anymore. No one says what they actually think, what they believe. I find myself staring at his dark eyes wondering how I could be so drawn to him when we are so different. It\u2019s a question that I smash away with a mental broom as soon as it surfaces. Thinking about Cole Stevens is not the pastime of a prudent person.</p><p>My inner-self reminds me that I am not a prudent person.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>The week creeps slowly by. The days are long and every minute of it spent with Cole. Work is more fun than I expected. I still wonder if I made the right decision. I have no idea what to do later in life with the things Cole is teaching me. I\u2019m not going to shoot this kind of stuff, although I start to see more of him. He seems to trust me, and speaks more freely. It\u2019s strange how often I have a smile on my face lately.</p> <p>I am seeing double by the time we stop after lunch. Cole stays in order to keep working, getting ready for a meeting later, but he sends me home. The halo that\u2019s burned into my retinas from editing images all day on the computer has started to dull and fade. I don\u2019t know how he stares at a screen all day.</p><p>The changes he makes to the photos during editing are so minute. It\u2019s like shifting a grain of sand on the beach. The one tiny movement seems to pull the whole thing together. I\u2019m still uncertain of myself, of what he expects from me. But I show up and I\u2019m trying. I feel like there\u2019s more to learn from him, but I\u2019m not sure what. The speech he made the other night is still fresh in my mind.</p><p>I avoid Edward. I don\u2019t know what to do with him. He said he loves me. I owe him an honest explanation about what I\u2019m thinking, I know I do, but I can\u2019t do it. Not yet. Mainly because I have no clue what I\u2019m thinking.</p><p>I pull my hair into a pony tail and slip on a pair of cotton shorts and a tank top. My plan is to lounge in front of the TV while Emma is out, and let my subconscious deal with Edward.</p><p>As soon as I kick my feet up, my phone rings. I tilt the screen so I can see the name. SUFFOLK COUNTY POLICE is across the screen. Sitting up, I answer it. \u201cHello,\u201d I say, wondering who is on the other end of the line.</p><p>\u201cAnna, good you\u2019re there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole?\u201d I ask, shocked. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t talk. I only have a minute. I hate to ask you this, but I need a huge favor. I\u2019m in jail. Please go to the studio, take cash out of the safe. The combination is scratched onto the back of my main camera body. Take ten grand and come get me out. Please.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019m trying so hard to remember everything he says, but I just blink at the phone like it\u2019s a joke. \u201cYou\u2019re serious? You\u2019ve been arrested and you\u2019re all the way out in Riverhead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get here by six, I\u2019m going to be stuck in a cell overnight. It\u2019s four now. Do you think you can make it?\u201d</p><p>I glance at the clock. There are a million questions I want to ask. Emma walks through the door, but I ignore her. \u201cFine, but you owe me huge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, anything you want. Just don\u2019t tell anyone. That\u2019s why I asked you.\u201d</p><p>I scoff at that. Walking away from Emma and into my room, I close the door and hiss, \u201cYou trust me? Are you insane? How the hell am I supposed to keep this a secret? You\u2019re a frickin\u2019 socialite! The papers will be all over this!\u201d I rub the heel of my hand over my eyes. I have no idea why he called me. Me, out of all people!</p><p>Cole says, \u201cI have a pretty good idea of what kind of person you are. You won\u2019t tell the press. I know you won\u2019t. And you keep your promises.\u201d It\u2019s a statement, a true cold hard fact that he picked up from working with me for hours on end. In that moment I understand why he called me and not someone else. I won\u2019t draw attention, no one knows who I am, and no one would ever expect the intern to go bail out her boss.</p><p>He trusts me. And he\u2019s shrewd.</p><p>\u201cGah,\u201d I sigh like a melodramatic teenager and laughingly say, \u201cYou suck. You know that.\u201d But I\u2019ve already made up my mind. Cole was right. I won\u2019t tell anyone he\u2019s in jail and I won\u2019t tell him no. I can\u2019t turn my back on someone who asks me for help. Call it a code of ethics, or maybe it\u2019s just a desire to be a better person, but somehow Cole sniffed it out. And that made him call me and not Miss Todd.</p><p>Shaking my head, I say, \u201cRiverhead. Fine. I\u2019ll be there in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019s quiet for a moment then says, \u201cThanks, Anna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I reply. I press END CALL and he\u2019s gone.</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>When I hang up the phone Emma is lurking in the kitchen. She\u2019s a bit of a busy body, always wanting to know what\u2019s going on. I suppose that fits her personality. \u201cHey,\u201d she says smiling at me. \u201cYou\u2019re home early.\u201d</p><p>I tug on my boots quickly and lace them up. When I come out of my room, I\u2019ve already pulled on jeans and my leather jacket. \u201cYeah, well, it was short-lived. I have to go out to the Island. Something came up. I\u2019ll probably just stay out there tonight.\u201d</p><p>My parents live out there; I could crash at their house after I free Cole. I wonder what he did. I walk to the closet and pull out a black full face helmet and a second larger helmet. It\u2019s white like a giant ping pong ball. Emma\u2019s eyes drift to the white helmet.</p><p>\u201cRiding out there with someone?\u201d she asks. Emma is leaning her hip against the counter. Her arms are folded over her chest. She seems relaxed, but I know she\u2019s not. I\u2019m moving too quickly for her to think everything is all right.</p><p>I shake my head. \u201cNo.\u201d I hold up the white helmet on my fist, \u201cI prefer this one at night, if I ride back later.\u201d</p><p>She arches her eyebrow, \u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s summer and I\u2019m taking Ocean Parkway. Geeze, what\u2019s with the third degree?\u201d I\u2019m a little defensive. I strap my backpack on. This is insane. I\u2019m going to be riding with ten grand in cash on my back.</p><p>She shrugs and uncrosses her arms, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. I just wanted to make sure you were okay.\u201d She walks into the kitchen and grabs a loaf of bread. \u201cYou want some food to take with you? I can toss you a PowerBar or something.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shake my head and grab the keys to my bike. \u201cNah, I\u2019ll eat once I get there. Talk to you later.\u201d And I\u2019m out the door.</p><p>I fly down the stairs and run across the street into the parking garage. My bike is right where I left it. Grays and blacks cover the frame. There isn\u2019t a spec of chrome or plastic on it. A pink stripe goes down the gas tank and explodes into a splash of color. Swinging my leg over the side, I kick start the thing\u2014mostly because the time constraint is making me nervous\u2014and pull out.</p><p>I zip in and out of traffic like I don\u2019t value my life. It\u2019s too close to rush hour. If I don\u2019t get to the Tunnel fast enough, I\u2019ll be trapped. I\u2019m lucky. I manage to get downtown quickly and park on the sidewalk in front of Le Femme.</p><p>I rush past Miss Todd, saying that Cole forgot something. She eyes me suspiciously, but doesn\u2019t follow. I find his camera body and flip it over. No scratches. No safe combination. Damn it. Where\u2019d he put it? I turn it over twice in my hands, looking for the markings, but don\u2019t find any.</p> <p>I\u2019m wasting time. I reach for the other camera bodies, but those are all clean too. I go back to the first body\u2014the one he always uses\u2014and take off the lens. I look at the housing between the body and the lens, tilting it to try to see hidden markings, but nothing\u2019s there. I reattach the lens and flip the camera over in my palms. Opening the battery door, I slide the battery out and still see nothing but black plastic.</p><p>My heart is pounding. This is taking too long. Pressing the lever for the memory cards, the little door on the side of the camera swings open. Three numbers are scratched into the curve of the casing on the inside of the door. I exhale a rush of air.</p><p>Taking the camera, I run to Cole\u2019s office, and open the safe. There are several things that catch my eye, including a small Tiffany\u2019s ring box. It\u2019s pale blue with the famous logo printed in silver letter across the case. Normally I wouldn\u2019t snoop, but the box looks like it\u2019s been crushed, stomped under foot. The blue leather is gashed and scuffed. The lid no longer closes correctly. It pains me to look at it. Something happened involving this piece of jewelry. I reach for the tiny box and lift it out. The lid falls off in my hands to reveal a solitaire engagement ring. The stone is huge and perfect. I lift it from its padding for a moment, staring at it, wondering who it was meant for and what happened when he gave it to her. From the look of the box, it didn\u2019t end well. My heart sinks as I hold the ring. Cole acts pulled together, but at the moment I\u2019m not so sure. It\u2019s like he puts his best foot forward and hides the rest. Things like lost loves and battered Tiffany\u2019s boxes aren\u2019t visible on his face. I breathe slowly and realize I\u2019m holding a piece of Cole\u2019s past, something he locked away from the world. I return the ring to the box and put it back. Ignoring it, I reach toward the back of the safe where cash is piled in neat little bundles. I grab enough stacks and shove them into my backpack. Miss Todd is going to think I\u2019m a thief if she sees me. I move faster.</p><p>Before I slam the safe closed, a piece of paper falls. I reach out and catch it. It\u2019s an old photograph. I can\u2019t ignore it. It\u2019s out an old picture of Cole wearing army clothes. STEVENS is across his chest, some medals line the other side. His eyes are cold and hard. He looks so young, younger than I\u2019ve ever seen him. I flip the piece of paper over, looking for a date, wondering if it\u2019s real. Was Cole a solider? Why would he enlist?</p><p>Before I have another moment to consider it, I hear Miss Todd\u2019s heels clicking down the hallway toward me. Her slow steady sashay gives me time to put the photo back where it was, close the safe, and zip up my backpack.</p> <p>When she walks through the door, I held up his camera like I\u2019ve found it. She cocks her head at me, like she can\u2019t believe it. \u201cHe forgot his camera?\u201d she asks, her narrow arms folding over her chest.</p><p>I nod and stuff that into my bag too. \u201cYeah, well, these things are expected. I think Cole\u2019s getting a little senile,\u201d I smile as I say it, half joking and not offering any other explanation. I have to get out of here.</p><p>She doesn\u2019t laugh at my joke. \u201cBut he went to a business meeting. At least, I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nodding, I pass her and head toward the door. Speaking over my shoulder, as she follows me out, I say \u201cHe was. Then he said he wanted it. I don\u2019t know. Cole said he usually has one on him, and asked me to grab it. He\u2019ll be back later tonight. Tease him then. I sure will.\u201d Smiling at her, I wave and run through the door, leaving Miss Todd standing there with a response on her lips.</p><p>The cash on my back is making me nervous. If I get pulled over for driving like a crazy person, they\u2019ll instantly add my name to the terrorist watch list. That would suck. Checking the time, I see that I\u2019m cutting it really close.</p><p>After pulling into traffic, I open the throttle and punch it. The bike takes off, humming like a bee. I bob and weave through cars and trucks trapped in rush hour traffic. As soon as I\u2019m back on Long Island, the wave of panic recedes. An hour and a half later I\u2019m in Riverhead and my butt is vibrating like I\u2019m still on the bike.</p> <p>I leave my helmet with the motorcycle and walk into the jail. After a few wrong turns, I\u2019m sent to the right person.</p><p>An old lady with face-saddlebags looks up at me, \u201cWho are you here for, hun?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m out of breath, and sweat makes my hair stick to my face. I push it back and say, \u201cCole Stevens.\u201d</p><p>She looks up at me from her metal desk. The eyebrow drawn on her face doesn\u2019t move. \u201cThe bail bondsmen closed at five. You\u2019ll have to wait until tomorrow. Next.\u201d</p><p>The guy behind me tries to push me out of the way, buy I hold out my arm like I\u2019m going to close-line him if he tries to push in front of me. \u201cWait. I don\u2019t need a bond. I have cash.\u201d I say to her, reaching around for my bag. Suddenly I feel like saying that out loud was a stupid idea.</p><p>The look on her face confirms my stupidity. She sniffs and raises her bloodshot eyes back up at me, \u201cYou have ten grand on you? In cash?\u201d</p><p>I nod. The tension in the room jumps about ten slots. She waves a pudgy hand at the guard. He steps closer. \u201cWe need a secure desk for this one.\u201d She jabs her thumb at me. \u201cShe walked in with ten grand in cash.\u201d They both roll their eyes like I\u2019m an enormous pain in the ass. It\u2019s just after five, but by the time they get a secure desk, which was me and another civil service employee and a cop, it was nearly 6:00pm.</p><p>They are talking to each other after the amount is counted, and acting like I\u2019m not even there. Finally, the woman hands me the bail slip and spews a bunch of stuff about how to get the bail money back.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do I do now?\u201d I ask.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d the cop says from behind me. \u201cThey\u2019ll show the judge the bail, and he approves it. If he gets the slip in the next ten minutes, your friend is out today. Otherwise, come back first thing tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I nod and go to the waiting area. It\u2019s half empty. A pregnant woman sits across from me on a wooden bench from the fifties. No one looks at anyone else. I wonder what Cole did to get tossed in here. Part of me is nervous about that. I don\u2019t want to ask. It will conflict with the new image of him that\u2019s floating through my mind.</p><p>I think about the picture in the safe, that younger version of Cole in the uniform. I realize that I have no idea who he is. It\u2019s strange because after the past few days, I felt like I did know him. Cole seemed more at ease. He didn\u2019t hold back when he was teaching me. Passion filled his voice when he spoke about photography and art.</p><p>But this? This is insane. I hardly know him and yet I\u2019m the one he trusted with his safe combination and bail money.</p><p>The metal security doors open and a cop walks through with Cole. He\u2019s dressed in a black suit. The jacket is hanging over his arm, his shirtsleeves are rolled up. Cole looks like he fell asleep in his suit. The cop tells Cole to get his things from the cashier\u2019s window, and then turns and walks back behind the doors.</p><p>The few people in the room look up when Cole walks out and quickly avert their eyes. Cole straightens his shoulders like he doesn\u2019t belong here. His cool blue eyes scan the room. He sees me and nods. I walk over to him. Part of me hesitates, like he could be dangerous, but my feet keep moving. I stop next to him.</p><p>Cole turns toward the cashier\u2019s window and takes a yellow envelope from the woman. He puts a ring back on his finger, his watch, and stuffs his wallet into his back pocket. He hands the envelope back to the woman and she throws it in the trash.</p><p>Cole turns and I follow him to the doors. When we step outside, there are no reporters. He smiles at me, \u201cYou did good, kid. Thanks.\u201d He sounds relieved. His posture changes and his shoulders relax a little. He takes a deep breath and runs his fingers through his hair.</p><p>I want to roll my eyes when he calls me kid, but I tease him instead, \u201cNo prob old dude,\u201d but I\u2019m tense and I know he can hear it in my voice. Cole looks around, breathing the air like he was inside too long. I can\u2019t keep quiet. I have to know. \u201cSo, what\u2019d you do?\u201d He eyes me, startled, almost. He seems surprised that I ask. Tilting my head, I fold my arms across my chest saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t ask me to drive all the way out here and not tell me. What\u2019d you do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sighs and rubs his hands through his hair again. He does that when he\u2019s upset. I\u2019ve seen him do that at work when he can\u2019t get a pose to work right. \u201cIt was nothing. Really\u2014\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t let it slide. It would be the height of stupidity to do this and not insist on knowing what happened. I lean my face a little closer to his. Catching his gaze I say, \u201cTen grand worth of nothing? By the way, that was insane. You have a mini bank in your office. Who needs that much cash? Is that why they picked you up?\u201d</p><p>He shushes me, and puts his hand on my back, leading me toward the parking lot. \u201cOh my god, Anna. Stop talking. Really. They\u2019re still criminals around. Do you want my office to be tossed before we even get back?\u201d</p><p>Turning to look up at him, I ask one more time\u2014one last time, \u201cListen, I think you\u2019re...\u201d I\u2019m so upset that I want to cry. I like working with him. I like my internship and whatever he just did shot it all to hell. There is no way I can finish now, and the craziest part is that I want to. When did that happen? I push away the thought. I\u2019ll deal with it later.</p> <p>A knot forms in my throat. \u201cWhy\u2019d you have to go do something horrible, Stevens? I actually liked going to work, and now you messed it up.\u201d I rub my face with the heel of my hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shock is in his voice.</p><p>We\u2019re standing on a cement island between the police station and the parking lot. I\u2019m so disappointed with him that I can\u2019t hide it. \u201cI can\u2019t work for a felon, and I think it\u2019d be better for both of us...\u201d</p><p>His laughter cuts me off. His face lights up like I said the funniest thing ever, \u201cWhat are you talking about, Lamore? You think I did something? What do you think I did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Something bad, since you won\u2019t tell me. I can\u2019t work for someone who might knock me into the East River one night.\u201d I\u2019m only half joking. He worries me now. I thought about it on the way out here and unless he was tossed in the slammer because of unpaid parking tickets\u2014which he should have been able to tell me\u2014then I can\u2019t work for him anymore.</p> <p>\u201cYou watch too much TV, Anna. Seriously.\u201d He scans the parking lot. \u201cWhere\u2019s my car?\u201d</p><p>I look at him like he\u2019s crazy, \u201cNot here. I took my ride. And I\u2019m leaving.\u201d I wait half a beat and when he says nothing, I say, \u201cHave a nice life, Cole\u201d and walk away.</p><p>Cole reaches out and grabs my arm. A shiver shoots through my body from his touch. I jerk my arm away. He holds his hands up, like he doesn\u2019t want to fight, \u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to...\u201d he closes his eyes. When he opens them again, he says, \u201cAnna, I didn\u2019t do anything. I was headed out here for a meeting and got ID\u2019ed. Apparently some tranny slugged a cop today. I\u2014\u201d he swears and shakes his head \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re making me say this. I got picked up because I look like him. They took me in because I matched his description. Then, I called you. Nothing happened. I swear.\u201d</p><p>I stare at him as he speaks. My lips part and my jaw drops. \u201cYou were arrested for looking like someone else?\u201d He nods. \u201cSomeone who assaulted a cop?\u201d He nods again. \u201cA transvestite?\u201d my voice squeaks the question as my lips quiver into a smile.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d his hisses, obviously still mad. \u201cNow you see why I didn\u2019t want to tell you, and why I don\u2019t want anyone else to know. It\u2019s the kind of mistake that smears people and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s not true.\u201d The strain flows out of his voice and I feel his hand on my shoulder. I\u2019m shaking from trying not to laugh. \u201cMiss Lamore?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t trust myself to answer; I nod, \u201cHmmm?\u201d</p> <p>Both his hands rest on my shoulders and I avoid his gaze. The giggles lick my stomach and toes, causing convulsions to rake through me as I try to hold myself still. Cole lifts my chin to meet his eyes. When a smile forms on his lips, I\u2019m doomed. Before I know what\u2019s happening, we\u2019re both laughing. I double over, clutching my stomach, barely able to stand. Cole is leaning on me, laughing just as hard.</p><p>Wiping a tear from the corner of my eye, I straighten and look at him. \u201cYour secret\u2019s safe with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no secret, Miss Lamore. I don\u2019t wear women\u2019s clothes. I don\u2019t punch police officers.\u201d He\u2019s still smiling, his voice lighter. He shakes his head at me, like he can\u2019t believe he\u2019s laughing. He must have sat inside stewing for hours. \u201cSo where\u2019s this car of yours?\u201d</p><p>Looking him in the eye, I grin, \u201cI never said it was a car. Come on, old dude. I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d He follows me through the parking lot. When we stop before the bike, he tenses. I shove the golf ball helmet into his hands and tell him to put it on.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d he asks, his voice too high. \u201cYou drove here on that?\u201d</p><p>I nod, fastening my chin strap. Swinging my leg over the seat, I say, \u201cYup, I rode here on this. And this is your ride home. Get on.\u201d I start the bike, but Cole just stands there. I glance back at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey just accused me of being...\u201d he sputters, blinking hard like he\u2019s in a nightmare, \u201cI can\u2019t ride two-up on the back of a pink bike with a girl helmet.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, I pat the seat, \u201cCome on, Cole. Suck it up. Be my bitch for a few miles and we can call you a cab. There\u2019s a diner a few miles away. We can stop there, I can eat\u2014you can grab a cab from there, that way no one knows where you were.\u201d His lips are in a soft smile, like he\u2019s in shock, and I wonder if he is.</p> <p>Finally he slams the helmet on, fastens it, and gets on the bike behind me. \u201cYou\u2019ve done this before? Driven with two people on this thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just keep your feet up and don\u2019t grab my boobs if you freak out.\u201d He laughs. I feel his hands slide around my waist. His weight shifts behind me when he puts his feet on the back pegs. \u201cHold on tight,\u201d I say, and we\u2019re off.</p><p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>The diner was one of those circa 1950 deals, complete with shiny fa\u00e7ade. Cole and I walk inside. Before we even have a chance to sit down, a guy walks in behind us with a girl on his arm. Her hair is teased out to Mars, and her implants bounce around under a tiny tank top. She\u2019s snapping her gum and I instantly hate her.</p><p>A middle-aged waitress sees us and holds up her pointer finger\u2014the universal signal that she\u2019ll be right back. I glance through the place. There are about five tables filled, all in the same section. Great. That means she\u2019s waiting tables alone, so gum-smacker would end up right next to us. I try not to roll my eyes.</p><p>I don\u2019t really notice the guy she came in with until he speaks. He has that fake Brooklyn accent that Italian guys think is so macho. He\u2019s wearing a bowling shirt with a once-white undershirt peeking out. His hair looks like a skunk crawled onto his cranium and died. There\u2019s a peppering of dark hair all over his body. He looks like a Sasquatch with gold medals hanging around its neck. When he walked in, he had his hand in the girl\u2019s back pocket. They were laughing like something was hysterical.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t happen until the waitress walks away. The tension didn\u2019t balloon into anything until the ape-man tapped Cole\u2019s shoulder, \u201cHey buddy, you lose your balls or what? Who the fuck lets the dame drive?\u201d He snort-laughs like he\u2019s hysterical.</p><p>As he\u2019s speaking, I turn and glance over my shoulder at him. My mouth starts to open with some snappy retort, but Cole\u2019s already acting. His fist flies into the man\u2019s face and connects with his nose in a loud crack. The hairy guy grips his face and blood streaks between his fingers. Before he can say a word, Cole is tugging my hand and pulling me out the door.</p><p>I\u2019m stumbling through the parking lot toward the bike. Ape-man\u2019s girlfriend follows us out, but she doesn\u2019t approach. Instead she stays by the door screaming profanities at us, saying she\u2019s calling the cops.</p><p>\u201cCole, what the hell was that?\u201d I finally manage, looking back over my shoulder. He sucker punched a guy in the face. Every muscle in Cole\u2019s body is tense. His fingers release my wrist when we get to the bike. He thrusts my helmet at me, an obvious sign that he wants to leave.</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d I scold. \u201cYou just made bail and now you punched some schmuck in the face?\u201d I\u2019m yelling and shaking as I start the bike.</p><p>Cole says nothing. We pull away and I don\u2019t know where to go. If they called the police, Cole\u2019s screwed. He doesn\u2019t tell me where to go or where to drop him off. He just sits on the back of the bike with his hands around my waist, rigid and fuming.</p><p>Since we are already out on Long Island, I decide to head toward my parent\u2019s house. They aren\u2019t too far away, and with the way Cole\u2019s fingers are digging into my sides, we can\u2019t get there fast enough. His reaction seems unwarranted, but he had his masculinity questioned too many times today. Apparently he was at his limit.</p><p>Cole doesn\u2019t complain, but I can tell the bike isn\u2019t his thing. Instead of wrapping his arms around my waist, he\u2019s been trying to keep a respectable distance between us, which makes it harder for me to keep a respectable distance from the asphalt. Cole didn\u2019t do corners when we started, but after the diner, he holds me tighter and leans farther as the bike winds down the ramps and turns corners. It makes it a hell of a lot easier to drive. I can\u2019t really blame him for not adapting to the motorcycle at first. Trust fund babies don\u2019t ride Harleys, not unless they are taunting some distant relative into disowning them. Me on the other hand, I was on my own and could do whatever I damn-well pleased. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The bike slows to a crawl and I stop a few houses down from my parents. Cole\u2019s grip on my waist loosens. Lifting my visor, I speak to Cole over my shoulder, \u201cMy parent\u2019s house is right here.\u201d He looks surprised, so I explain, \u201cA guy and girl on a bike with a pink splotch is kind of easy to pick out. If that guy at the diner called the cops\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut me off, \u201cI know. I\u2019m out on bail, even though I didn\u2019t punch the cop earlier.\u201d</p><p>I nod. \u201cI know and it looks like you\u2019re punching your way to the Jersey shore.\u201d My lips pull into a smile. Cole\u2019s grimace doesn\u2019t crack. I get serious, \u201cHey, stay here for the night. It\u2019ll give you a few hours until your lawyer is back, and then you won\u2019t have to worry about being thrown in jail. From what I\u2019ve heard, if you get tossed in after six, you stay there for the night.\u201d I cringe, and look at my parent\u2019s house muttering, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not really sure if this\u2019ll be much better.\u201d</p><p>Cool blue eyes examine my face. They move from my left eye to my right, then down. It is such a sweet expression. I can tell that he doesn\u2019t understand why I\u2019m being so nice to him. Looking at his hands, he asks, \u201cWhy are you helping me? I mean, I know you\u2019re altruistic, but I kind of deserve whatever I get after today.\u201d</p> <p>Glancing at the side of his face I notice a dusting of stubble lining his jaw, and the tension lines between his eyes. \u201cYeah, well...\u201d I debate telling him how much he\u2019s grown on me, how much I like him. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that I wanted to punch the girl in the face, but I didn\u2019t have the guts to do it. We\u2019re a little more alike than I would have thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell spoken,\u201d the corner of his lips twitches like he wants to smile.</p><p>I grin, \u201cWell, one of us has to be. We can\u2019t all turn into thugs and just smash people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssholes,\u201d he corrects. His hands rest on my thighs just below my hips. The weight of his palm feels good. The crinkles at the corners of his eyes make me smile.</p><p>I laugh, \u201cFine, assholes. But I gotta tell you, my dad will probably mess with you, call you a girl, tell you that your way too old to be his daughter\u2019s boyfriend\u2014and if you punch him\u2014he will shoot you in the face. He\u2019s crazy like that.\u201d</p> <p>I pull my visor down and drive down the street with Cole sputtering, \u201cBoyfriend?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>We\u2019re standing on the front porch. I\u2019ve rung the bell and we\u2019re waiting. I can hear my Mom upstairs in the kitchen. They live in a spilt-ranch, so the house is broken up into several levels. The clatter of kitchen noises carries out onto the porch. The screen door is open to cool the house. The sun has set and the street lights just came on.</p><p>It\u2019s a balmy night. I pull my hair into a ponytail to keep it from frizzing, while we wait.</p><p>Cole follows me and stands there watching me before saying, \u201cBoyfriend?\u201d</p><p>I nod with a plastic smile on my face, my eyes looking straight ahead, knowing exactly what we are in for. \u201cYup. Wait and see. It doesn\u2019t matter what you say. I could tell them that you\u2019re a gynecologist making house calls and they\u2019ll still say that\u2019s nice.\u201d I glance over at him, \u201cThey\u2019re insane.\u201d</p> <p>An older woman emerges on the landing. We can see her through the door. She\u2019s wearing a swimsuit cover-up. Her dark hair is frizzed at the temples. When she looks up, she walks toward the door with her arms extended, like she\u2019s planning on hugging me through the screen, \u201cAnna, honey!\u201d She\u2019s beaming, all five feet of her. Turning, she calls up the stairs, \u201cAnna\u2019s here! Set another plate!\u201d</p><p>I pull open the screen, and say, \u201cHey Ma,\u201d when she leans into hug me, her eyes shift to Cole who is standing behind me in the shadows. She stops, mid-hug.</p><p>\u201cAnd who\u2019s this? You seeing someone without telling us?\u201d</p><p>I shake my head. I don\u2019t know why I bother to talk, \u201cNo, Ma. This is Cole. We aren\u2019t dating.\u201d I give her a hug and step inside. Cole follows behind me, his expression a little concerned.</p><p>Ma steps toward Cole. He extends his hand, buy she swats it. I hear the slap. His eyes grow wider when she takes him in her arms for a hug, \u201cPish! You\u2019re practically family!\u201d She\u2019s laughing and calls up the stairs, \u201cBetter make that two plates! Anna brought her boyfriend!\u201d</p><p>Suddenly my dad is standing on the landing. He\u2019s a stout guy with a beer belly and orange shorts that are a size too small. The neon color doesn\u2019t do anything for him either. There\u2019s a sausage impaled on his fork, \u201cAnna\u2019s boyfriend? How\u2019d you know she had a boyfriend?\u201d Dad looks at me, shaking his head, smiling, \u201cYou never tell me nothing. Anna, why you holding things back from your old man?\u201d</p><p>He waves his hands as he\u2019s speaking, shaking the fork. The impaled meat bobs on his utensil until the sausage flies off, and slaps me in the face. It stings before it falls. Cole reaches out and catches the meat before it hits the floor.</p><p>Cole leans in close to my ear so they can\u2019t hear, obviously terrified, \u201cOh my God\u2014\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t bother muffling my voice, \u201cYeah, this is nothing. Wait for dinner.\u201d</p><p>I wipe the grease stain off my cheek, and follow my dad into the kitchen. Cole trails behind me trying to tell my mom the truth\u2014that he\u2019s my boss\u2014but she won\u2019t hear it. My dad just smiles and nods like a deranged hood ornament. It\u2019s like they hit fifty years old, and their brains entered I-need-a-grand-baby-now mode. It never turns off. Needless to say, they are perfect for scaring the crap out of guys I want to ditch. Since I was hoping things would have worked out with Edward, I didn\u2019t mention him, yet. As for Cole, it was the perfect alibi, assuming he didn\u2019t run from the house screaming after dinner.</p><p>CHAPTER 19</p><p>Ma hands Cole a plate and dumps a mound of anti-pasta on it. Tonight must be meat night. Dad stabs another sausage and puts it on his plate before over-loading mine. He pinches my cheek and says, \u201cYou\u2019re too skinny,\u201d while I stare directly at Cole, who\u2019s sitting across from me. He\u2019s trying hard not to laugh.</p><p>Cole lifts his glass to take a sip when my mom says, \u201cIt\u2019s not good for a pregnant woman to be so skinny. You remember that Cole. Fatten her up before you knock her up.\u201d She raises her glass to my dad and they clink them together, laughing. They think they\u2019re hysterical.</p><p>Cole chokes on his drink. Before he can recover, they\u2019ve started talking about conception superstitions. I\u2019m staring straight ahead with a blank look on my face, counting. If I leave the table before seventeen minutes, they\u2019ll pester us for the rest of the night. But I don\u2019t know if we can do it. About ten minutes have passed, and Cole looks like he\u2019s going to die. I lean back in my chair, and shove another piece of pork in my mouth.</p><p>Ma\u2019s saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a spoon under the bed, not a shoe!\u201d She\u2019s yelling at my father who smiles sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cA shoe seemed right,\u201d Dad mutters.</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes meet mine. I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s trying not to laugh or cry. The fact that my mom was a debutant makes this even more amusing, but he doesn\u2019t know that.</p><p>Two minutes left. Just two. We can do this. I count backwards from 120. My counting increases in speed as the conversation enters ground zero.</p><p>My mom ignores Dad, saying, \u201cIf you put a spoon under the bed while you have sex, you\u2019ll make a boy.\u201d She\u2019s pointing her fork at Cole while talking. She stops for a second and taps the empty utensil to her upper lip, \u201cWhat\u2019s it for a girl? Frankie, do you remember?\u201d</p><p>Dad grins, \u201cA red ribbon. That\u2019s what your mother put under her mattress when we made you.\u201d</p><p>Ma slaps her hands together and points at Dad, \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d They share a look that makes me sick. Then she gazes at me, saying, \u201cAnd it worked, Anna!\u201d She turns to Cole, and is talking to him like he\u2019s across the room. She\u2019s so loud, \u201cWe wanted a baby girl, and see\u2014the red ribbon brought Anna.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019s still talking, saying things that make me cringe. I pick at dinner and notice that Cole hardly eats. I make a mental note to sneak into the kitchen after they\u2019ve gone to bed. I also note to never wear a red ribbon ever again.</p><p>I tune back in when my mom is starting to talk positions, \u201cMissionary is God\u2019s preference for boys, but girls, Cole you have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>Three. Two. One. I jump up. Cole mirrors me and finds his feet. I say, \u201cThanks for dinner. Since we\u2019re living in sin and trying to fornicate a set of twin grandbabies for you, do you mind if we share the den tonight?\u201d</p><p>Ma and Dad are speechless. They say nothing as I take Cole\u2019s hand and pull him out the backdoor. We sit in the yard talking until my parents go up to bed. They watch us out the window like we\u2019re celebrities while they do the dishes. Periodically they wave through the window.</p><p>My parents are a little crazy, and I understand why. I just can\u2019t tell anyone about it. They\u2019re alone. I\u2019m their only child. It was hard when my mom was disowned. Every single relative cut her off, and all because her evil mother didn\u2019t like my dad. Frankie the Dock Dude wasn\u2019t classy enough for her daughter. Grandmother forbade the relationship. My mother responded by eloping. Grandmother disowned them, and threw her daughter out like she was trash. They\u2019ve never spoken again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My parents had been dirt poor. There were times when we had no food, no medicine. I still remember in vivid detail how hard they tried to give me things that the other girls had, but I usually went without. I learned from them that life isn\u2019t about the stuff\u2014it\u2019s about the relationships\u2014and some relationships are worth fighting for.</p><p>I want that. I want to be so insanely in love with someone that I\u2019d walk away from everything I knew, just to be with him.</p><p>CHAPTER 20</p><p>I feel restless, like I won\u2019t ever be satisfied. Cole\u2019s hands are warm. His smooth skin slides over my bare waist as he kisses me harder. My lips burn, they throb as I pull him closer to me. His thick hair is tangled in my fingers, his strong arms around my waist, pulling us closer\u2014tighter together. Heat fills me. A burning desire to feel him inside consumes every thought I have.</p> <p>There is nothing but him and me.</p><p>My nails claw his back as his kisses leave a hot trail down my neck. Our clothes are gone. It\u2019s just his slick body against mine, but he won\u2019t take me. He won\u2019t push inside of me. I cry out, saying his name, begging him to take me. The third time I plead, he answers me. Without a word, he flips me over. I land on the sheets, and look up at him. My legs are splayed before him, completely exposed.</p><p>Cole doesn\u2019t hesitate. His hard body meets mine and he pushes into me, rapidly, over and over again. I can\u2019t stop calling his name. I want him, I want him to fill me with come.</p><p>I want things I shouldn\u2019t want. I feel things I shouldn\u2019t feel.</p><p>There is no hesitation, no holding back. We move together like we were made for each other.</p> <p>\u201cCole,\u201d I say softly.</p><p>A hand shakes my shoulder. The dream shatters, and fades, but the emotions are still flooding my body. The spot between my legs is pulsating like he was really there, even though he wasn\u2019t. Slowly, I realize I was dreaming and open my eyes.</p><p>Horrified, I\u2019m looking up into Cole\u2019s face, \u201cAnna, you okay?\u201d His eyes are concerned, searching my face for answers that I can\u2019t say.</p><p>Pushing up, I shake the sleep from my eyes, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d My voice catches in my throat.</p><p>Cole nods and sits on the coffee table across from the couch. He\u2019s still watching me. I feel his sapphire eyes on the side of my face, though I don\u2019t look at him.</p><p>After that dream, I don\u2019t think I can ever look at him again. Heat sears my cheeks and I wish I could hide, but there is nowhere to go. I know my mind was only replaying the lies I told my parents, but it felt real and that\u2019s what scares me.</p>  </body></html>"]
